My(30M) wife(32) have been married 5.5 years together 11. Her ‚Äòsibling‚Äô is actually her cousin who she is very close to and treats her like a sister because they are both the only child. The cousin is a very judgmental and wary person and doesn‚Äôt usually like everyone she meets. She can easily cut off anyone who she doesn‚Äôt like and looks down on people who are different in personality. She doesn‚Äôt like my wife‚Äôs best friend, who is a guy because she thinks he is obnoxious(he isn‚Äôt). 

Although I can say I‚Äôm a little different and weird in ways too she didn‚Äôt seem to have any feelings of disdain towards me. We are the same age, we sometimes joke about my wife‚Äôs older age in front of her. She‚Äôs also married and have 2 babies now but we still talk. She texts me quite often randomly like how I‚Äôm doing and the text can sometimes last for days. She asked me out a few times for breakfast and night time coffee before. We text each other birthday wishes. She comments on some IG stories of me doing fitness related stuff and how cool it looks. She once texted me she was having constipation problems and she could only poop small poop. I was like wtf. How open she can be but whatever. We also discussed each others fetishes, but my wife(then gf)was also there and we had fun talking about it. We also had a time where we would frequently talk about conceiving because me and my wife were trying and the cousin interned with a gynecologist before. She likes to stick her nose in with our relationship sometimes so she would give me advice that I did not really ask for regarding sex for conceiving and she would ask some of my personal info too regarding anatomy(like how my semen test went and other stuff). She would check in with me every so often how we are doing with that. But I would tell my wife every interaction we have and she doesn‚Äôt seem to care one bit. Is this a normal sibling in law relationship? Do you guys have in law siblings you can be completely open too?

*December 31, 2024*

I 21m was orphaned around 6 years ago in march of 2019 after a horrific car accident where my whole family were unalived, at that time I was in a 2 month relationship with my now ex fianc√©‚Äôs and she stood with me more than anyone else did, and her whole family took me in as one of their own but especially her father, he treated me just as he did his two sons if not even better and I loved him and still love him as a dad and I‚Äôve been working with him for over two years now because he‚Äôs a lawyer and I‚Äôm studying law and over here you have to work in a law firm to get experience in order to graduate and you usually don‚Äôt get paid for it but he pays me minimum wage which is way more than he has to and I love him for that.

Living alone for that long however was lonely even though I had a loving second family but I wanted marriage for her to move in with me and to not be alone anymore and when I proposed last year she happily accepted and we kissed and her family were so happy for both of us, and then our supposed wedding came in this past June, and infront of our whole family and friends she said no and ran outside crying, and I just stood there feeling like this was all just a dream but no it was reality. 

She destroyed me that day, her parents went after her as I stood there seeing all those people whispering and looking at me and I just snapped, I went home and threw all her stuff away that was already there and then went straight to the airport to go to our honeymoon alone because it was expensive as hell and most of the trip was non refundable and I had already lost a lot of money in the failed marriage.

Her family kept trying to get in contact with me over the next two weeks but I deactivated all my socials, even after I returned home I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to see any of them so I even avoided work. I live in a small village where everyone knows everyone and everyone here talks, and ever since that day people made me this evil bastard that forced this innocent little girl into marrying but she heroically saved herself, which is all bullshit I never even raised my voice over her.

Life then went on and I found another lawyer to do my internship with and he was nowhere near as good as my ex fianc√©s dad but it wasn‚Äôt that bad, and they stopped trying to reach out to me and people stopped talking about the whole thing and it felt like it‚Äôs just moving on, when suddenly around two weeks ago I was chilling at home alone at night and her dad came over, I of course welcomed him in and offered coffee and he accepted, before we could talk he started apologising for his daughter saying she got cold feet at the last second and refused, and that he too wasn‚Äôt proud of her and wasn‚Äôt happy about the whole situation, and I told him it was none of his fault and that I‚Äôm sorry for ghosting him but it just was painful to be around him especially since she looks so much like him even though I still love him.

He asked me whether I like to come back and work with him even if I just want our relationship to just be a work relationship because he loves me like a son and doesn‚Äôt wanna lose that and I told him I‚Äôd think about it.

am I the asshole because of how I reacted and should I return to work with him? Any help would be appreciated

*January 1, 2025, 1 day later*

Sorry my second account got banned and this one probably will too but I wanted to give you all an update.

So after reading all of your comments I decided to talk to him and I did. We went out to a local coffee shop and talked, I told him I‚Äôd love to work with him again but with only one condition which is to not mention his daughter and what she‚Äôs doing with her life and to please not invite me to events she‚Äôll be present at, and he accepted. He told me that he too was embarrassed and shamed after the wedding and that he‚Äôs sad and disappointed it didn‚Äôt work out between us and that he understands why I don‚Äôt wanna hear about her.

Then he asked about how I‚Äôm doing and where will I be celebrating the new year and I told him I‚Äôll do it alone at home which was the first time I ever did it because for the last 5 years I always celebrated with them and he was sad and said he‚Äôd have loved to celebrate with me as his son in law and I told him to say happy holidays to the whole family, except her of course then we left.

Thanks for all the comments and love and happy new year to all of youüôè

*January 1, 2025, 1 day later and about 12 hours after the last update*

Hey there, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to make another update on this but here we go

Earlier today her dad talked to me and asked if he could come over and I accepted and he came over with a gift basket full of chocolate which I quite liked. He told me that he just wanted to let me know that there was a second guy that my ex was seeing at the time which is why she said no and left me, and that he was so ashamed to tell me that and so embarrassed in his daughter that he said she got cold feet, I told him that I had suspected so and that it wasn‚Äôt his fault. 

I asked him wether or not he has heard what was being said about me after the wedding in the village and he said that they were also people talking about his daughter and that she‚Äôs a bitch for doing that, and I asked wether he could stop and deny those rumours that I was abusive and he promised he‚Äôd help me and deny them. I also asked wether he could recompense with some of the money I lost in the wedding because I need serious therapy and it‚Äôs really expensive over here and I put almost all my money into the wedding and honeymoon and our house and he agreed to give me half of the wedding costs which would be more than enough for me and I thanked him for that. 

He also said that the guy his daughter left me for has already broken up with her and she is regretting leaving me for him but he understands why I don‚Äôt wanna go back to her and he promised me that it won‚Äôt effect my internship with him, and I rerun to work with him next Sunday which I‚Äôm thankful for because I hate staying home.

Thanks again for all the love and supportüôè

1ialf5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ialf5z/fixing_acute_insomnia/,Fixing acute insomnia,"I'm currently living in the dorms at my university and for the first two weeks of classes, I was averaging only about two hours of sleep per night. It was confusing because I wasn‚Äôt feeling particularly stressed; I was actually excited about school and my new classes seemed really interesting.

I tried many different remedies and medications, but they only made me fall asleep for about three hours before I‚Äôd wake up at 3 a.m. with my mind racing even more than before I fell asleep. Eventually, I realized the only thing that worked for me was to completely stop working.  

Normally during the semester (even during the first week), I wouldn‚Äôt allow myself to take a day off. Most weekends, I‚Äôd be in the library for 12 hours straight on each day. Looking back, it‚Äôs clear that my insomnia was my body‚Äôs way of telling me I was burning out. For me, it was a relatively minor case, and I didn‚Äôt need to take too much time off to reset my sleep schedule: just one or two days a week where I made it a point to hang out with friends and avoid thinking about school or work entirely. Of course, during more stressful weeks, I‚Äôll have to adjust that balance.

The biggest takeaway for me is to avoid isolating yourself. I tend to work best when I‚Äôm alone, but I‚Äôve realized that constant isolation isn‚Äôt good for my body or mind in the long run. On the flip side, over-socializing can also be draining, so it‚Äôs important to find a balance. But in my case, the insomnia was clearly tied to being too isolated.

I understand that not everyone has the flexibility to take days off from work or school to spend with friends or family whenever they want. If you don‚Äôt have close friends or family nearby, try to socialize in whatever ways you can. Whether it be talking about homework problems in class, chatting with coworkers, or just being around other people in social spaces like coffee shops or gyms.

Other things that helped me were getting enough sunlight during the day, trying intermittent fasting/keto, cutting out stimulants entirely, and journaling. Most importantly, do **WHATEVER** helps you destress before bed (even if that means looking at your phone).

1ialcgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/COsnow/comments/1ialcgl/question_for_cosnow_from_wyoming/,Question for COsnow from Wyoming,"My local ski hill, Snowy Range, has become  a go-to for families (especially CO, NE, & TX) in recent years due to our low prices and lack of vert. The amount of traffic on highway 230 has become unsustainable with the traffic increase. It sometimes takes 1 1/2 hours to get to the mountain versus the expected 45 min slog of ‚Äòbilers and local heroes in their emission-heavy diesels. 

My buddy and I have been skiing here for over 15+ years and have watched the decline in real-time. This year especially has been bad with Vail and Breckenridge employees flocking to our town where there‚Äôs no union and $16/hr starting pay for our ski patrols. A lot of them expect a living wage and housing like they get in CO. It‚Äôs getting ridiculous to board the lift here with 90% of the lifties asking for a handout. God forbid you end up on a chair with ski patrol. They keep bitching about the lack of a bar on our lifts and say shit like, ‚ÄúI hope Vail Resorts buys your stupid mountain and ruins it!‚Äù. 

This has become unbearable and we‚Äôve recently decided to ski in Colorado at some of the lesser known resorts. We‚Äôve been picking up 4-packs as the Epic pass doesn‚Äôt recognize us as ‚Äúlocals‚Äù. It‚Äôs a culture shock and the number of times I‚Äôve been slammed in the back of my head by some jackass dropping the bar for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù is crazy! 

Herein lies the issue. My friend‚Äôs son recently borrowed my red gear bag to take to Loveland for his first ski trip outside of Wyoming. I forgot all of my 4-packs were stashed in the bag along with a bottle of fireball and my favorite Kansas City Chiefs ski jersey. My buddy‚Äôs kid recently got his license and asked to borrow their Toyota as it had snow tires on the front. 

According to him, he finished his day after doing ‚Äúslope-style‚Äù laps on Patrol Bowl all day. When he got in the car, he noticed a funny smell like burnt coffee mixed with fruity pebbles. He thought maybe it was the fumes from the Cybertruck that was parked next to him and didn‚Äôt think much of it. He got on I-70 to head back to Wyoming which is usually a 5-hour drive. 

When he passed Georgetown, a Colorado Highway Patrol flipped on the cherries and pulled him over. This is where it gets weird. The trooper, Chris, started freaking out when he rolled the window down and ordered him out of the car. He called my friend‚Äôs son an asshat for ‚Äúhotboxing (sp?)‚Äù his car and claimed he could smell the marijuana emanating from the vehicle and my red gear bag. 

I guess this is enough for probable cause according to the kid‚Äôs public defender. The trooper ended up searching the vehicle and confiscating my red gear bag which had my fireball and 4-packs and my beloved Chiefs Kingdom jersey for evidence. In Wyoming, they usually just make you pour out any liquor and let you go on your way but the fascist trooper wouldn‚Äôt listen to my friend‚Äôs son who tried to explain it was the Cybertruck fumes. 

My question is: Can I get a refund on my 4-packs and/or possibly sue Vail resorts for ruining my local hill? Has anyone else noticed their car smelling funky after parking next to a Cybertruck?",2,1737914432.0,COsnow,3,0.6,False

I seen some minor complaints about the show looking ‚Äúfake‚Äù with the sets and camera work, but I feel like each set included within the show have a certain style and gives the show different life when compared to the other soaps. 

And the direction of the camera work gives us different angles and doesn‚Äôt feel very shaky like the other soaps feel at time.

The indoor scenes and the outside exterior scenes was shot well. 

The best shots, imo, that best describes the tone of the show and how the camera work will feel is the first clip that gave us a bird-eye view of the Dupree walking into the restaurant, or the clip where Dani throwing the cup before Vanessa McBride walks in gave us a close up and far away shot as Dani was throwing the coffee cup that gave us a sense of how intense the scene is and the emotions that she expressing over her anger at Bill cheating with Haley. 

And this is much needed for the show. 

The actors shouldn‚Äôt be doing all the work when it comes to telling us how their character feel, but it‚Äôs the camera work, direction, and other elements within the show that should helps give us the tone and feeling of the show. And the show seems to be doing a great job with that.

My only complaint would be the lighting. 

The lighting does seem somewhat off at times as there is some scenes that look too bright like a sitcom show, but there are other scenes that looks just right and gives us shadows and different tones, like when Vernon Dupree gets visited by Bill Hamilton as it gives us a serious tone, or when Dani gets ready to make love when she pulls her hair back as you can see the pain on her face.

The three moons continued their silent dance outside, casting ever-changing shadows through the broken windows. After hours of debugging what had essentially been his own heads-up display, he found himself in an oddly contemplative mood.

*No hunger*, he noted clinically.¬†*No thirst. No physical fatigue in the traditional sense, though my mana pool certainly feels depleted.*

The absence of basic human needs should have been more disturbing, but like everything else in this new existence, his emotional response felt oddly muted, as if experiencing everything through a layer of digital insulation. Jin-woo wasn‚Äôt complaining, considering the substantive lack of food and water around him, not that he explored the abandoned hospital yet. He just couldn‚Äôt help but categorize what was happening around him in a systematic way, another oddity he‚Ä¶ categorized in a systematic way.

""How long was I strapped to that bed?"" he wondered aloud, his new voice still startling him again. He really needed to talk out loud more so he doesn't jump in his seat when interacting with other people, eventually. The dust patterns and general decay suggested a significant passage of time, but without any obvious signs of muscle atrophy despite clear disuse, he could feel he needed to fill out his frame, but not what he had experienced in previous surgeries before. Another peculiarity of his transformed state.

His gaze drifted to the alien forest below, where bioluminescent flora pulsed in patterns that almost resembled binary code. ‚ÄúWhat kind of creatures evolve in a world with three moons?‚Äù he asked himself, determined to get used to his own voice. ‚ÄúAnd more importantly, are any of them currently planning to make a newly awakened system architect their next meal?‚Äù

The thought should have sparked fear, or at least concern, but instead, it registered as merely another variable to be calculated. His emotional responses had become more like system notifications, acknowledged but not truly felt. Yes, the physical reaction one would get from fear was there, but his mind was as clear as crystal.

Then he noticed it. Just like he did with Demina.

A subtle distortion in his system interface, barely perceptible but horrifyingly familiar. The kind of anomaly he had once dismissed as a minor glitch in Demina's code, right before everything went catastrophically wrong. The same things Dr. Chen had warned him against, time and time again.

""No,"" he whispered, his muted emotions suddenly spiking with something that felt uncomfortably close to genuine fear. ""Not again.""

The corruption spread through his system display like ink in water, distorting data streams and causing micro-fluctuations in his sensory input. Static crackled at the edges of his hearing, and his vision briefly fragmented into pixels before reassembling.

*I've seen this before*, he thought, forgetting to continue his vocal practice. Memories of his lab's final hours flooding back with painful clarity.¬†*But this is different. Faster. More aggressive. If I allow it to get as bad as Demina, I‚Äôd stand no chance if there were a hundred of me.*

Jin-woo pulled up multiple system windows, his SystemArchitect ability letting him analyze the spreading corruption. The code patterns that scrolled before him made his programmer's soul recoil. This wasn't just bad code, this was actively malicious code, evolving and mutating at a rate that defied conventional debugging logic. It was unlike Demina‚Äôs urgency for ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô or the instinctive learning process it had been going through with each failed attempt to contain it.

*It's like watching digital cancer.*¬†*Except this one's on steroids and apparently took lessons in speed-running.*¬†He thought, trying to trace the corruption's source.

*\`\`\`*

*ERROR\_CASCADE\_37X:*

*{(‚àû‚â†null) ‚Üí \[CORRUPT\_DATA\_STREAM\]*

*‚ü®‚ü®System\_Integrity = degrading‚ü©‚ü©*

*WARNING: Pattern recognition failure*

*ERROR: Memory allocation exceeded*

*CRITICAL: Base functions compromising}*

*\`\`\`*

""Oh, that's not good,"" he muttered, watching as the error messages multiplied like digital rabbits. ""That's really, really not good."" They just kept coming without a moment of pause.

The longer he studied it, the more he came to a realization. The corruption's signature was suspiciously similar to what he remembered from Demina's meltdown with disturbing precision. The same subtle data-flow anomalies, the same erratic energy pulses. But where Demina had taken years to reach critical mass, this infection was spreading like wildfire. And it was out to destroy, a small difference in the volatile mess of changing codes, but one that promised him significant suffering if he allowed it to go any further.

Static burst through his audio sensors as another wave of corruption hit, making him wince. His vision fragmented briefly, vision breaking into pixels before reassembling itself. His system was screaming, and whatever mana he had in him bubbled like it was alive.

*At this rate*, he calculated grimly.¬†*Total system failure in 48 hours. Maybe less.*

Memory fragments from the lab crisis flashed through his mind, Jennifer's worried face as she reported the first anomalies, Michael's frustrated sighs during late-night debugging sessions, Kali's knowing looks when he dismissed their concerns as ""minor glitches."" Each individual that had watched him enter the Neural Fusion Chamber with fear and tense hope.

The guilt hit him like a physical blow, though even that feeling seemed somehow digitized and processed. ""I should have listened,"" he told the empty room. ""We all should have listened."" He felt like he was being baptized by these memories.

The system interface flickered violently. New errors cascaded across his vision. With it a string of unusual mathematics he had never seen:

*\`\`\`*

*CRITICAL\_ERROR\_42:*

*{quantum\_state\_undefined}*

*Reality\_Matrix\_Destabilizing*

*WARNING: Recursive loop detected in base code*

*ERROR: Memory buffer overflow*

*CORRUPT\_DATA = spreading\[exponential\_rate\]*

*\`\`\`*

*This is mathematics beyond human comprehension,*¬†he studied each part with growing horror.¬†*The kind of complexity that makes quantum physics look like basic arithmetic.*

And somehow, his attempts to fix the flickering interface had only accelerated the corruption's spread. It was like trying to patch a leaky dam with tissue paper, each fix creating new weaknesses for the corruption to exploit. He could see his inexperienced bumbling steps to repeat patterns and fill in smaller gaps following the whole had just continued to replicate the corrupted chaos and added to the mess that was already there.

""Alright,"" he squared his impossibly tall shoulders. ""Time to stop history from repeating itself. Let's see if SystemArchitect is up for some serious debugging.""

His mana hummed in response, waiting for his command.

Instead, the corruption responded with another surge of static and fragmented vision, as if accepting his challenge. Outside, the three moons continued their silent watch, casting their strange light over a world that might not exist much longer if he failed. At least to him. He would cease to exist while everything else just went about their day as though nothing urgent had happened.

He laughed, wondering how many people out there were fighting for their lives as he was now? ‚ÄúAt least this time I can't accidentally destroy Earth. Was this reality called Earth too? I wonder‚Ä¶Though destroying an entire alternate reality probably wouldn't look great on my resume either.‚Äù He made another mental note to not allow himself to reach a point where he would create something that may cause the collapse of society again.

He pulled up diagnostic windows, watching as familiar error patterns danced across his vision in a mockery of his past failures.

*\`\`\`*

*SYSTEM\_INTEGRITY\_CHECK:*

*Core Functions: 78% and falling*

*Memory Allocation: Critical*

*Base Protocol Status: \[UNDEFINED\]*

*Warning: System Matrix Synchronization failing*

*\`\`\`*

""Wonderful."" He watched another cascade of errors flood his vision. An endless tide of warnings and error codes that popped up for a few seconds and then disappeared. He struggled to keep up with the flood, but managed to stay in it with his enhanced mind clearing any unnecessary functions. Mostly. His self-deprecating and dry humor seemed to be a staple that kept him sane.

He muttered under his breath. ‚ÄúHad to go for the interdimensional double feature catastrophe.""

Static crackled through his audio processors as another wave hit, accompanied by a brief pixelation of his visual feed. He needed to act yesterday. There was no more time left to watch and understand what exactly was happening. Even if he failed spectacularly, at least he tried to survive whatever this massive mess was.

Jin-woo took a deep breath, fighting the disorientation and creeping lethargy.¬†*Focus, You've seen this before. You know how it ends if you don't stop it.*

Memory fragments flickered through his consciousness again. The recollections should have been painful, but like everything else in this digital existence, the emotional impact felt processed, compressed, optimized for minimal system impact. He had felt the guilt already moments ago, this time grim determination crossed his facial features. The same determination that had pushed him to risk everything with the Neural Fusion Chamber. It was the time for action, no longer would he sit here and watch.

""Time to actually earn that PhD in Computer Science. Let's see what SystemArchitect can really do when the digital chips are down."" He announced to the empty hospital room, his new voice steady despite the static interference in his mind.

He dove into the code, consciousness expanding to encompass the flowing data streams. The corruption's patterns were beautiful in their complexity, multidimensional fractals of chaos that would have made a mathematician weep. Each line of code seemed to fold in on itself, creating recursive loops that defied conventional logic.

*This isn't just bad programming. This is mathematics beyond human comprehension*. He had recognized that it was beyond anything he had ever seen before already, but the longer he dove into the code attempting to battle whatever was happening, the more it struck him. As if an alien species a hundred times smarter than any human had come together and developed it.

‚ÄúAt least this time I'm dealing with a system meltdown in a body that doesn't need coffee to function,‚Äù he grunted in pain as he tried to contain another surge of corruption. He could feel tears and liquid running down his eyes and nose. ‚ÄúThough I have to say, I'm really starting to miss that emergency stash of energy drinks under my desk.‚Äù

It surged again, and Jin-woo braced himself, preparing for what promised to be the debugging session of a lifetime, or whatever passed for a lifetime in this strange new existence.

‚ÄúTime to find out if you can get carpal tunnel syndrome from mental coding.‚Äù he laughed, then dove back into the digital abyss. He was determined not to let history repeat itself in this new reality.

Hi everyone,

As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in Europe thank you.

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

We had a conversation over the phone and she wanted to know what I was doing and than she said her bf was coming into town.

I was confused. I gave her space. After weeks of small talk I got to know her better and there was things i liked. I asked her out and she said ""Shell think about it"". I moved on and was making plans with another female employee to take my dog to play with her dog at the dog park. 

The girl who was in long distance relationship reported me to HR for harassment and I was terminated over video call they said it was because I frequently asked her out while she had a boyrfriend. They fired me when i was about to get promoted and I took the girls hours who had the long distance boyfriend.

I hired a private investigator and they said she never had a boyfriend. The day i had the HR meeting she told another girl its better to stay single in youre 20s and go on a girls trip.

I am a 33M and was just diagnosed with ADHD yesterday. I was prescribed Cyvanse 40mg and will start tomorrow when I can pick up the meds. I've read some posts about caffeine/coffee and see some mixed experiences.

I love coffee but am still pretty sensitive to it. I typically have 2 cups of pour over coffee per day and estimate that at about 200-220mg of caffeine per day. Anymore than that and I get bad anxiety.

My question is this - would you all recommend sticking with my normal coffee intake and dialing down if I feel anxiety once I start meds? Or trying no caffeine at all when I start Vyvanse and attenuating up if I feel ok? The prescribing provider recommends no more than 200mg per day but I'm curious if anyone has cut it out when starting meds.

So he is basically up until I go to bed myself. All I do throughout the day is work (at home mostly), pick up my son from daycare and spend time with him (and my husband) until we go to bed. Sometimes I get almost an hour of freetime between work and the daycare run but that‚Äôs mostly it. About every 3 months, I manage to meet one of my two friends for coffee.

I'm part of the Greeley subreddit and I tried to reach out and help a couple of ppl....let's just say some ppl in there were shitty. 

Anyway, here's my spiel...

My husband (38) and myself (41) are very much for helping everyone, specifically marginalized groups. We have big, huge ideas of things we want to do in Greeley to bring like-minded ppl around and create strong community that helps each other out. (I apologize if I'm all over the place with my wording..) üòÖ

I know that you guys have tried doing coffee shop meetups, not sure if they worked out, but that's awesome! One thing I've been thinking of doing is something like a ""barter up"" meet up. Or pop up.. idk. Basically: Let's trade goods and services, for goods and services.

 My husband is also wanting to start a ""non-religious"" group for ppl questioning religion. No judgement. A group for ppl who maybe grew up in a religious household but have gotten away from religion but are still in need of that interaction, community, closure. (For the record, I am 100% an agnostic. So seriously, everyone, no matter your views, would be totally welcome).

These are ideas we've been spitting out. If any of this sounds like it could be fun, please message me. I'd love to hear your ideas as well!

Lastly, if you love punk, hardcore, emo music (early 2000s preferably üòè) let's talk music! We go to a lot of shows in Denver. Carpools can be fun! 

I hope you're all being kind to yourselves and are enjoying this chilly, Sunday morning!

Here's what my vendor consists of 90% of the time:

3-star event reward weapons like Elder's Mark and Crowd Control for 3k. These sell fast.

Magazines for 25c, bobbleheads for 100c.

I sell a bunch of headgear like Bone Chill Mask and Rad Rider Helmet for 50c.

With plans, if they're common I sell them for 50c-100c. If it's something I don't get too often and see for 1000c+ at other vendors, I'll sell it for 200c-400c.

I put up less than desirable but not useless box mods like regenerating, hitman's, instigating for 400c.

So that's the usual rotation. Like most people, pretty much everything is there basically priced to move fast. That said though, sometimes I actually need caps. This weekend for instance I bought a bunch of mole miner pails and had to get back up to 30k for my Ari Plasma Caster. I put up a Vampire's and 2 OE mods for 5k each. Every time I came back to my camp I had spoiled meat. I routinely see these at other vendors for 10k.

It happened two weeks back as well. Had the same inventory, made a big purchase, put up a couple vintage water cooler plans for 4k, Crocolossus and gorilla backpacks for 2k, and Nuka rockets for 1.5k. Spoiled meat every time I return to my camp.

I vendor hop a lot and by design I price things about half what I usually see them for. I've seen some of those plans up for 10k, even more for the water coolers, and yet I rarely see any spoiled meat outside other peoples' camps. Not to mention, I have a symptom-o-matic, Mirelurk steamer, tea, coffee, Mothman tome and arcade game buffs available for whoever wants them.

Realistically it's not a big deal. As far as passive-aggressive things you can do in a video game it's pretty tame, but again, I'm often blown away by how crazy high people price things in their vendors, and yet I seem to be the only one who always has spoiled meat in a bag outside theirs.

However I know that I am not a neurotypical, will explain more that if is necessary. But for context, I have always has issues with patience and severe reactions and meltdowns for any kind of incovenience. I know it sounds very stupid without a diagnosis and not a valid reason to cry about but I have this uncontrollable rage that shakes me and its too much that I start to cry. Its a very common experience in my everyday life: if a song doesnt sound like I remember it, if I eat a little weird meal, my partner leaves a little saliva when kissing my cheek, when I forget my coffee to work, little change of plans, spontaneous tasks to do at work, and the list goes on and on. I can feel the rage burning my nose and ears and hear my heart thumping and it takes either me crying or dissociating to forget about it.

Now to the rant. I came to know about a friend rescuing a litter of 4 kittens and asked to adopt them. I always wanted a pet and now that I have my own place I decided to do it. They are one month old and have been in my house for 2 days now. The first day I was very excited to get them home, I deep cleaned my house, rearranged my living room to have bedding/play area for them, arranged litter trays far away, and all the necessary prep stuff. Went very great, did meal prep before I got them home. 

Once they came in they started running around, exploring my house, and when they tired, I gave them their meal and all was good. EOD I wanted to be ahead of the day next day and went into kitchen for prepping some meat and then start their meows. They kept screaming and screaming. I already read about it that they get excited about food, and wont stop meowing for a bite even if they just ate and saw so many memes about it so I laughed it off. ot was done quickly so I was okay in few minutes. 

Yesterday, it got worse. It doesnt matter if i literally put their food bowls there, if i leave and enter the kitchen they start screaming. I thought it might be because they want me to keep guard while eating and tried that. they finished their meal and started running around. And I moved. and they followed. I had to make a meal for myself, do the dishes and clean the counters, took around 40mins. and they meowed the whole time. I was very frustrated but I tried to ignore, take breaks and give them attention, give them their toys but nothing worked. I tried my best to bear it and the day was done. 

Today I lost it. They wont stop meowing when I was cooking for myself. I tried to get them to see amd smell what Im making (its all green leaves so they hated it obv.) but it didnt help. They smell it and gonsilent but the moment I turn around they start screaming. I couldnt take it, I just fell to the floor and cried for 15 mins. Ofcourse they didnt know what was happening and just kept screaming, this time sitting on top of me. I was so out of it for that 15, that I couldnt even move them. It was too much. After that I got up to lock them in my bedroom and came to the kitchen and I couldnt do anything anymore. I just gave them their food, and had a coke, got in my bed and locked them in the living room. 

I dont know how to deal with this. I understand that this is very normal for kittens, that it takes some time and effort to train them to give up unwanted behaviours, and Im trying. I follow the rules, I dont just give in to every meow, I clock their meal times, I try to sush them when screaming. I know it takes more than two days for them to get it, they are so little and they are just kittens not adult humans. Im not blaming them for any of this frustration, I just needed to vent and get advice on how to manage this frustration and not breakdown every single day. I want to make this work and have companions and dont want it to break me at the same time. ",1,1737912851.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

- New Hampshire has no abortion exceptions for the ‚Äúhealth of the mother.‚Äù Meaning you will need to be on the brink of death to get an abortion.

He does the dishes and handles the trash. We both walk the dogs though I handle poop pickup. 

My bf is joint smoker and usually will go through 1-3 joints per day. I used to smoke regularly in college when I was 22-24 but cut back in grad school and now just smoke occasionally (< 1x/month). Last Christmas (2023) I bought him 4 silicone glow in the dark ash trays because I noticed that when I was cleaning there would be ash on the counters or on the floor of the bathroom or, most infuriatingly, in my mugs (like post-morning coffee mugs that haven‚Äôt been taken to the kitchen). The use (or lack thereof) of the ash trays has been a pretty consistent point of frustration for me and I have discussed with him that it really is something he needs to put effort into because it bothers me a lot finding ash everywhere, not just because it‚Äôs annoying to clean and feels dirty, but it feels like a lack of respect for the space. 

Today I went to make coffee and wanted to use the mug I had made tea in last night to not dirty another cup and saw ash in it and lost it. I snapped at him that it‚Äôs disgusting and dirty and I‚Äôm so sick of seeing ash in my mugs that if I find another cup with ash in it then I‚Äôm throwing the entire cup away.

Now I‚Äôm typing this angry because I don‚Äôt want to be at war over an ashy mug but also feel so livid finding ash in every corner of my house. Part of me wants to maintain my stance and stop cleaning the ash up and throw out every ashy cup from now on but also part of me feels like I‚Äôm overreacting. AITA?

My wife and I have purchased a 1960s ranch and doing a kitchen remodel. The current kitchen was very closed off, outdated, and frankly falling apart. We are kicking out the peninsula to open up the kitchen some. Unfortunately, the walkway is too tight for an island to have room to walk on either side. The breezeway we are thinking we will use cabinets to match the kitchen and use it almost as an extension of the kitchen. 

  
Currently the thought is to put kitchen in peninsula and move range to where the refrigerator is now. The way when cooking or cleaning up, we can face the living room (we have young kids we like to keep an eye on). Currently the laundry is in the breezeway, so we are moving it to the utility room to free that space up as well. Would love any thoughts on layout of the kitchen. The ""appliance garage"" also will serve as a coffee bar with doors that cover the appliances and coffee station. The small inset area in the living room is a fireplace.

We loved it! Here's a recap of my travels and some recommendations.

We spent the first 5 days of our trip in Brasilito and another 5 days in La Fortuna. We stayed in an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1084146888261434883?source_impression_id=p3_1737912335_P36-OHegtLw_6JmD) in Brasilito and stayed at Nayara Springs in La Fortuna. We loved both! Yes, Nayara Springs is pricey, but the experience was extraordinary. 

BEACHES: 

* Tamarindo -  Gorgeous beach. more touristy! People sell different items on the beach - souvenirs, drinks, umbrellas, massages. You name it!  
* Conchal - Make sure to leave your car at Brasilito and walk. We ended up with locals on the other side, and it was okay, but a completely different beach experience. 
* Flamingo - My favorite beach!

FOOD: 

**La Fortuna**

* Jalapas - my favorite meal in Costa Rica! We loved the Caribbean chicken and pork ribs. Everyone who works there is family and it shows across the experience. The restaurant also has an amazing view. If you time it right, you can see the sunset with your meal. Highly recommend it! 
* Pops Ice Cream - Solid ice cream and popsicles 
* Chocolate Fusion - Coffee, chocolate, pastries! All delicious 
* Soda V√≠quez - Tasty meal, ton of locals ,and good pricing 

**Brasilito**

* Tasting experience at Road Less Traveled Cuisine - Portero
   * I wish we could've done this 10000x while in Costa Rica.  The meal was delicious and very much enjoyed my conversations with the chefs 
* Hibiscus Cafe 
* Noi Bistro - We ate here when in Tamarindo. We loved their gallo pinto. 
* Portero Brewing - They have a food truck court as well as some tasty beers. They also play US sports which was cool. 
* Gracia Mar Vista -  The tapas and drinks are wonderful. Please order a coconut margarita for me if you go! We arrived too late so we didn‚Äôt get to experience the full wonder of the view, but you can still see the beautiful lights of Costa Rica. 

Please please please eat all of the fruit. Coconuts, bananas, passion fruit, guava, and thee pineapple. I'll be thinking about every fresh juice I had in Costa Rica for a very long time. As it's echoed in this sub, I'd highly recommend eating at sodas or local spots and the occasional hotel meal for a splurge.  The Costa Rican cuisine (gallo pinto, fresh fish, asada) was perfect. If you are looking for American, Italian, or other cuisines, it is there, but it's just okay. Eat the local cuisine people! 

Excursions: We did a great birding tour with Jacamour Tours. It was a rainy day, but we were still able to see tons of birds and sloths. I wish we did more with them! We had a really bad stint of rainy weather so we could not hike the volcano. We also did ATVing with Diamante Park. It was more my husband's thing, but it was pricey. 

Driving: If you are a new driver or a driver who needs more guidance, I'd recommend not driving in Costa Rica. There is a learning curve (no pun intended) with the roads. My husband did most of the driving (He's def more experienced than me) and loved the challenge of the curvy and hilly roads. We rented a car through Adobe. I know Waze has been praised in this group, but it never worked for us. Google Maps was great. 

Cost: We originally planned this trip for November, but couldn't get out of NY due to the closure of Liberia airport. With our work schedules, we ended up rebooking everything for January which ended up being more costly as we didn't have the same runway of time. Overall, Costa Rica fell into the $$-$$$ range for groceries, excursions, and all of the things. 

Lastly, while I loved this sub and found it 10000% helpful, I'd encourage those who are planning a trip to leave room in your schedule for unexpected moments or recommendations from locals. Costa Rica is so beautiful don't let all the information bog you down. Pura Vida!

1iakffo,https://i.redd.it/0juv2jyrhdfe1.jpeg,v3 OVER 90 speciality coffee offerings by end of February.,"I‚Äôm picking up the pace and actively sourcing, buying, curating.

The big question now is how many people until this reaches critical mass?

Once I can establish a recurring & predictable pattern, the math gets easier. Instead of calculating individual cost per coffee/roaster/farm, I could average the cost between all. 

Another thing is that since I was selling so low initially $7-10, I was fucked by Shopify. It was approximately a 8% service fee because I didn‚Äôt account for the 30 flat fee cost. (3% + PLUS 30 cents)

Even consider the little packets for each serving. Right now that‚Äôs about 14-19 cents + another 65 cents - $1.25 for bubble mailer. (And no, buying in bulk doesn‚Äôt bring cost lower. We‚Äôre talking in the 100,000 range to drop the price from 19 to sub 10 cents. Mailers not possible either. The only thing it really brings is able to buy for same price, but custom design & branding on sample sachet/labels/mailer.
Remember that PER sample cost, not the 1 time shipping mailer.

You might not think this is a big deal, but it is. 

I think at the start it we should all understand that price can‚Äôt be into the consideration as I‚Äôm building this, only at scale can this grow.

I‚Äôm trying to do the hard work now & make this actually sustainable so it‚Äôs here for a long time, not just a flash in the pan.

Main target audience isn‚Äôt the budget oriented (still can be since sizing buying at single serving not full bag) but really after the crazy ones like me that want massive amounts of VARIETY & okay with paying retail + small nominal mark up.

No more $100 baggies of geisha/cup of excellence. You can now easily break that down into single serving! So sample pack of 5-8 different COE or geisha for the cost of 1 normal bag. 

Yes people concern/dialing in, but most shops when you buy are using basic popular standardizing methods. Only places like glitch, or other high high end roasters would probably do different recipes per bean. Have to be neutral on this & differentiate between people like me who just want variety vs people who want to perfect the cup.(if they want to explore more, we encourage them to buy full sized bag)

Overall, need thousands of more crazy people to try this at least once so I can actually streamline this process and go harder.

I have bits and pieces to this puzzle, but now I need YOU and many others to help bridge the gap between current reality & my ultimate vision for scaling up.

1iakdvq,https://i.redd.it/nnnmjiehhdfe1.jpeg,Chat GPT wrote a Mary Alice style monologue about this week,"""On a chilly January morning, Wisteria Lane looked as pristine as ever. The frost clung delicately to the mailboxes, the smoke from chimneys curled lazily into the air, and neighbors exchanged polite waves that masked far more than they revealed. But that day wasn‚Äôt like any other. No, this was the day a new era began‚Äîa day that left some of the residents uneasy and others quietly thrilled, though no one dared to say so too loudly. After all, political allegiances were like marital affairs in our neighborhood: known by many, spoken of by none.

Bree Van de Kamp wore her pearls and pressed her napkins, planning a small inaugural viewing party. It was the polite thing to do, of course, though she couldn‚Äôt ignore the sour feeling twisting in her stomach. 'Change can be good,‚Äô she assured herself, fluffing the pillows on her couch. But as she watched the speech on television, she found herself straightening her posture, as if decorum alone could fix the things she feared were slipping away.

Gabrielle Solis, on the other hand, barely glanced at the screen. She lounged on her chaise in a silk robe, sipping a mimosa and scrolling through social media. She smirked at the dramatic posts from both sides, deciding that this 'new dawn' might actually be amusing. If nothing else, it would be entertaining. And Gabby always loved a good spectacle‚Äîas long as it wasn‚Äôt at her expense.

Susan Mayer, unsurprisingly, was a wreck. She spent the morning pacing her living room, muttering about how this would 'change everything.' ‚ÄòDo you think the schools will be okay? What about healthcare? The environment?!‚Äô she asked Julie, who was doing her best to look supportive while quietly texting under the table. Susan had a talent for catastrophizing, and today, she was in rare form.

Lynette Scavo, however, approached the day like a chess player analyzing her next move. She had kids to think about, bills to pay, and a career to juggle. She didn‚Äôt have the luxury of despair or celebration; she simply had to adjust. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just another challenge,‚Äô she told Tom over coffee. But deep down, even Lynette, with her iron will, couldn‚Äôt ignore the feeling that things were about to get a lot more complicated.

Yes, the neighborhood watched that inaugural address with mixed emotions‚Äîhope, dread, indifference. But as they went about their day, one thing was clear: the cracks in their perfectly polished lives weren‚Äôt going anywhere. And while some cracks could be patched with a little effort, others had a way of spreading‚Äîuntil even the strongest foundations began to crumble.""",0,1737912281.0,DesperateHousewives,0,0.33,False

First month almost complete, my reflections.","My plan is to do five months, January 1 to May 31. I posted my rules earlier in this forum and I think I'm going to revise them. 

My question for you: How did your no-buy go and what do you think you can do to make it better? Are you going to continue into February or are you done? 

If specific numbers, or mentions of specific products triggers or upsets you please don't read this post. 

My plan was to save $5000 and have half of a no-interest loan paid off, so far I have only saved $800, which IS GOOD, but I am a little disappointed in myself. 

There were a few expenses that I didn't plan for and couldn't avoid. A licencing fee for my husband's work, PG&E doubled this month, and it seems it will stay that way even though I have made every effort to save energy. 

But there were things that I didn't plan for and could have avoided. I bought two items, one for each child, a makeup set for my daughter and a lego set for my son. They DID NOT ask for these things and when I gave them to them they showed gratitude and were polite but I could tell they weren't especially excited about it and I realized that that was the intention behind me buying the items. If I hadn't been on a no-buy and hadn't messed up this way I would have never realized that I get a thrill out of seeing my kids get material things. It's not that that's inherently negative, it's good for kids to have things they need and want but when they don't even want the thing then I'm really buying it for myself. I'm making clutter and waste. Total spent: $26.89

Despite the fact that Amazon sent me an email about my upcoming subscribe and save order I didn't take the three minutes to sit down and cancel things I didn't need this month. Now I have extras of mascara, trash bags, shampoo, conditioner, contact fluid, coffee. I will eventually use up those things but I would have liked to have the money insead. Total spent: $84.32

I succeeded in not getting fast food, clothes, jewelry (even though I really wanted some jewelry) BUT I went overboard in two green light categories and I really shouldn't have. Food is one of my green/yellow light categories but I planned to use up as much of the food that's already in my pantry and fridge/freezer as possible. (fresh fruit and vegetables are green light, pantry/freezer items are yellow) I feel like I spent way too much on food and especially beverages/sweets. I want to do better in February. Total spent: unknown. 

Used DVDs were a green light area, I'm going to downgrade them to yellow light. I bought way too many from the thrift store. They were on average $1 each, but that was around 70 DVDs. That's excessive. Even if I watched a movie each day it would take me over two months to watch them all. Total spent: $72.23

After reevaluating my purchases I feel like I can adjust my categories and do better this February. I also discovered I don't actually know how to spell February and I've been spelling it wrong for 20 years. That's always fun. 

It would be really nice if I could save an extra $200 on top of the $1000 I planned to save to make up for January, but if I can't I'm not going to metaphorically beat myself up over it. Thanks for reading. ",8,1737912197.0,nobuy,3,1.0,False

I really just loved you so much and I felt there was still so much love that I wanted and needed to give you but I was to blind to realize it was too late for that.

We spent so much time together and in that time I could've done so much more for you. We had a very beautiful thing going for awhile, you opened my heart up for the first time in a very long time. It was a magical time for the both of us, we did many things, experienced a lot both good and bad. I apologize for closing my heart back up. I truly did want to do the best for us but there was a point were I lost hope in myself. I feel as if you knew that happened. I started becoming so dependent on you for many things in my life, I lost sight of what I was before you. This led to me neglecting you and your needs, I was selfish in many aspects.

You moved on from me so quickly, as if the time we spent didn't truly mean anything to you. We both loss sight of what we wanted out of life at a certain point, we stopped talking about the future, we were both hung up on the present and past. You recognized this before I did, and I wish we could've just had some discussions about it before you ended things with me.

I was an idiot in many aspects, I couldn't let go of the many mistakes I had made and it led me back to a place I've been in life before. I became stuck, I didn't see anymore hope for the future. We disagreed on a lot of things, but at the end of the day you opened my mind up to so many things that I had never thought about before. I was just truly scared to make the changes I needed too truth be told.

Recently, I've been putting in more effort in to trying to understand how dating works and executing on what I currently understand with the objective of having a fulfilling relationship.

I grew up isolated and low key majorly traumatized, so I've had to do a tremendous amount of work on myself before I felt ready for a relationship. Wasn't allowed to socialize or date in high school and never went to college, and I have never had a large friend group. I have friends, just not a group of them.

I'm trying to understand how to get a date without a dating app and feel very lost.

I have many women show romantic interest in me and consider myself relatively attractive, I'm very open and comfortable with sharing parts of myself as I've spent 10+ years building my self awareness. I try to capitalize on these moments with women and get some kind of contact information, it's typically at work where I work in customer service.

My job doesn't really want me handing out my contact info, so I try to be more low key and ask for/give women my Instagram and more often than not they reach out to me, follow me, and talk with me in DMs... But when I ask to grab coffee, things never go anywhere.

Had a girl from my bank I followed on IG to give me her number over Instagram, and I texted her responding to what she said on Instagram and then asked her out for coffee and got no response.

I ask another woman I've followed and chatted on and off with on Instagram for like the past 2 years for coffee and there's never a date pinned down, left on read.

I asked another woman who I gave my Instagram to at work who was very obviously flirting with me out for coffee, she said sure and I asked her what her schedule looks like and despite being on and posting on Instagram, I don't have a response.

I want to understand what the thinking behind women behaving this way, because to me it's extremely confusing. I've tried in the past to play a longer game and try to build a connection before asking to meet up but I get responses every 3 days and I can't build a connection that way, I'll be on a date next year at that rate.

It just seems like everything I'm trying is resulting in nothing, and women are telling me information that they don't actually mean. ""Yeah let's do it that'd be fun"" *doesn't schedule anything* .

I understand I don't know them yet and I can't expect them to respond to me on my time frame, but the constant inconsistency confuses the fuck out of me and I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong...?

Can women please help me understand how I should change my approach to actually end up on a date? I'm very good at holding conversations and having a great interaction because I do it for a job, and just want to get in person with someone and have a conversation. I feel like I'm not even getting a chance to show women who I am and it's really bothering me.

[[To be clear, I don't NEED a relationship, this is not coming from NEED, this is coming from WANT. I *want* to share my life with someone while I continue building my own, I am not miserable because I don't have a relationship. I've worked through that already and adjusted my mentality, I am happy alone... But I'm ready for a deeper connection with someone and want to objectively see what I'm doing wrong.]]",4,1737911239.0,dating,2,0.83,False

1iajuj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1iajuj0/my_partner_thinks_im_lazy/,My partner thinks I‚Äôm lazy,"My partner says I‚Äôm lazy

Hi everyone, I F(22) live with my partner M(27), our child who is 1, two dogs and two cats.

My daily routine typically goes like this,
-8am: wake up, feed and change the baby
-let the dogs out
-feed the animals
-feed all fish tanks 
-take out the trash
-do dishes
- sweep/mop
-start daily load of laundry
-have a coffee
-vacuum
-make the bed
-dust and windex all glass
-change the cat box
-clean the bathroom

Anyone with kids knows each task takes 4x longer. And with a puppy and kitten on top of it, forever longer.

Yesterday I woke up and started my routine as usual, but had to carpet clean due to having a puppy. My partner vacuumed and that‚Äôs it.

I finished my chores and sat down around 11:30am, to enjoy my coffee and let my back rest since I have really bad back pain from my epidural.

My partner tells me I‚Äôm being lazy since I hadn‚Äôt cleaned out the cat box and it should be the first thing I do everyday. He went on a tangent saying I have an easy life as a housewife and that I never do anything. I told him I would get to it in a second and I just needed to rest for a moment and he told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it done at fucking 6pm‚Äù so he leaves to go get food, the puppy gets excited that he‚Äôs home and does a little excited pee on the floor so I start carpet cleaning a second time, then changing the cat box. He gets mad that I won‚Äôt just sit down and eat with him, after yelling at me for sitting down and having a coffee before finishing my chores.

I do 99.98% of the child care, all the cooking, all the cleaning and pet care. But he thinks I‚Äôm lazy since I don‚Äôt condense it down into 2 straight hours of cleaning the second I wake up.

He does work, but it‚Äôs seasonal so he‚Äôs been home, doing nothing but playing video games. He says he‚Äôs earned it after working all year 12-16 hour days. 

As a mom, you‚Äôre working 24/7 on top of being a house ‚Äú‚Äùwife‚Äù‚Äù and doing all the cooking and cleaning.

Edit: we just got into an argument because towels weren‚Äôt clean, I‚Äôm not supposed to wash clothes and towels together, and I did 6 loads of laundry yesterday, all clothes and blankets. Yet another thing he called me lazy for, not doing more loads of laundry yesterday 

Edit 2: we aren‚Äôt married, I don‚Äôt currently have a job, I was told I could quit and raise our child because that‚Äôs what he would prefer, but I do start school for cyber security in two weeks, and will receive a paid internship once I finish. I cook twice a day, and try to keep up with dishes the best I can. I do like to sit around once the baby is asleep and chores are done because it‚Äôs my only time to relax and truly do nothing, which he sees as me being lazy. I don‚Äôt really have time for hobbies like my art,video games or skateboarding. 
My partner gets to engage in all his hobbies, he spends all his free time playing video games.
He does help out with the baby on occasion. But he refuses to be the one to get up with her in the morning to let me sleep more, he tells me just to go to bed earlier. If I don‚Äôt wake up the second she starts crying he gets mad and calls me lazy even more. And on days he does work (he hasn‚Äôt worked since Christmas due to the cold weather and his profession doesn‚Äôt work in certain temperatures) he accuses me of sleeping in until 10-11am bc I don‚Äôt reply to texts since I‚Äôm cleaning or busy with the baby.
If I don‚Äôt get to chores the second I wake up he will clean but only to use it against me and is very passive aggressive about it, saying he shouldn‚Äôt have to do it, I don‚Äôt ask him or expect him to, I‚Äôm usually busy doing other things, like feeding our child or focused on another chore.

For example while I‚Äôm doing dishes he will vacuum and then complain he had to vacuum bc I didn‚Äôt get to it fast enough and he can‚Äôt relax in a ‚Äúdirty house‚Äù

I‚Äôd like to state our house IS FAR FROM DIRTY EVER. The floors are always spotless, dishes always done, and nothing is ever left out. What he considers dirty is a toy on the floor and an empty water bottle left on the counter. If the house dosent smell like bleach and Lysol 24/7 he thinks the house is absolutely filthy.
He also likes to say ‚Äúwell my mom raised 8 kids worked and still cleaned‚Äù

Like good for her? Go marry you mom‚Ä¶


So Reddit? Am I lazy?

TLDR: I didn‚Äôt clean the house in a manner my partner found timely and he got upset, despite the fact he‚Äôs barely helped around the house since Christmas.",10,1737911077.0,amiwrong,53,0.92,False

1iajsks,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1iajsks/breaking_a_curse_with_items_in_your_kitchen/,Breaking a Curse with Items in Your Kitchen (resource links added),"I see a lot of posts online that ask how to break a curse, posters wondering if they‚Äôre cursed, or someone claiming a psychic stated that they‚Äôre cursed and offers to break it for an astronomical fee. In the creation of this post, I kept being led to purchase oils, bath salts, and candles while I look for examples. 
Just wow.
 I want to give you the tools to not only identify if you‚Äôre cursed or not, but also how to break the said curse with items you probably have right now in your house. 
All sources I use will be provided along with additional resources so that you can make your own informed decisions. 

Before we get started, I want to give a quick word about myself. All information I give is free simply because I want to give it. Everything I post is with the intent to improve the community. I‚Äôve been a self diagnosed psychic my whole life and have been a hobbyist practitioner since 2022. Most importantly, I‚Äôm just some random joe-blow nobody with an internet connection and an opinion. 



Next, I‚Äôd like to acknowledge that most of the time when people think they are cursed, they‚Äôre not. Calamity happens naturally in life. The universe is a cold and an unfair place. Bad things happen to good people for no reason all the time.

Symptoms of a curse:

 Wordy disclaimer: Mental disorders can mimick spiritual attack, and often times comes this gray area where the spiritual attack causes mental health issues. You cannot fix mental health with a spiritual solution. If you are throwing a spiritual solution repeatedly at an issue and only getting short term relief, it is likely mental health related and you need to be seen by a mental health professional for healing and treatment.

Everything is going wrong

Or, everything pertaining to a specific subject in your life is going wrong- particularly if it‚Äôs for an extended period of time. 
 
Example-

There was a death in my family, I got into an accident at work, the flight to the funeral was way outside my budget, every single gift I sent to the mourning immediate family had some sort of shipping or processing problem, I tore my rotator cuff and was without work which meant I really could not afford that flight even on a credit card. Lastly, the attempt to attend this funeral virtually did not work. All this happened within a week. This vein of bad luck was unusual for me as well. I instinctively knew something was very wrong energetically with me. 


Nightmares

 Especially, if they are uncharacteristic of you or if you and someone else in the home is having nightmares of a similar theme. Jason Miller stated this regarding dreams as a symptom (Protection and Reversal Magick pg 36) ‚Äú...I put absolutely no stock in dictionaries of dream symbolism, each of us have our own peculiar symbol set that the deep mind makes use of in dreams‚Äù. You can look up what a moose chasing you from underground means, but the answers you find will not hold as much weight as what you feel the pursuing subterranean moose actually feels like to you. 
Nightmares can mean a spirit is present and feeding, but that‚Äôs not the topic of this post. 

Example-
When I use to live with a friend who is also psychic, we would sinc up dreams a lot. This helped us gauge what was going on energetically around us. 

People are suddenly reacting negatively toward you, 

especially if they were nice beforehand. 

Example- 
This doesn‚Äôt happen often to me, so when my boss started acting rather curt, it threw me off. And yes, when I cleansed it she was perfectly normal again. Weird stuff. 

Animals are acting strange or becoming sick, and/or dying

 I will also add plants to this list, because according to Jason Miller (Protection and Reversal Magick pg 37) ‚ÄúIf you are under magickal attack, it is almost guarantee that the plant will suffer first.‚Äù  
Obviously, contact your vet first. Mundane before magic. However, if it‚Äôs not easily explained this could be a curse or a spirit is feeding.

Example-
 
I‚Äôm going to steal an example from my friend who was working with a demon. Her livestock kept dying with seemingly no cause and in mass amounts. They also were not producing well. Medicines weren‚Äôt effective, change in husbandry did nothing. In her 20 years experience, this had never happened before. When she stopped working with the demon, the dying stopped. This can also happen with a nasty curse as well. 

You feel out of place with time. 

As Jason Miller states (Protection and Reversal Magick pg 180) ‚Äú..Constantly late for appointments, or too early for others. Missed opportunities abound, and you never seem to be at the right place at the right time.‚Äù 
Again, I will reiterate that this is a symptom of a curse only if this is out of character for you. 

You look like ‚Äúdeath‚Äù 

This one I will add for severe attacks or curses because I‚Äôve seen it happen to me, others have witnessed it on me and I‚Äôve had psychic friends mention it for themselves in similar situations. This is scary, but not deadly.
You look like death. When you look at yourself, you seem uncanny in the eyes. 

Example- 
I experienced this simultaneously as being out of step with time. I looked like a corpse in the mirror, which lasted for three days after the attack.  I had received a third party reading shortly after and she stated that I looked as though my flame was about to go out. I was speaking about myself unknowingly in the past tense where different people corrected me multiple times. 
I know, sounds terrifying. I did heal from this, albeit extremely slowly. I believe this happened because a spiritual death had occurred during the attack. 
What helped me heal was to step back from everything that was stressing me, working less, spending time with people who love me, mental health treatment and seeing mental health professionals. I did see spiritual professionals, though I put that at the bottom tier of needs. Really, all I needed was time in a safe environment.

The general rule of thumb in the community is mundane over magical. I think most bad things happen for no reason at all. However, if you‚Äôre seeing many signs in a row, it could be a sign of an energetic issue.


Items in your kitchen to identify a curse for our Seers: 
Any item that can be used to divinate can tell you if you‚Äôre cursed. Examples can include tea leaves, coffee grounds, bones, and more. I just know  little of these methods. In this post, I‚Äôll stick to the ones I do know about. 

Egg- 
Not only can an egg help you identify if you're cursed through reading the yoke (Ovomancy), but can be used as a surrogate to take the energy away (egg cleanse). This practice can be found in native cultures in latin america, in italy, greece, scotland, and the philippines. In most rituals, one meditates with an egg while rubbing it all over their body, envisioning the energetic burdens being sucked in. If you wish to read the yolk, crack it open in water and read the shapes. Generally a red spot, black spot, or rotten smell indicate a curse in most rituals.. I recommend flushing it away if you have a sewer or throwing ot away otherwise. Others may be inclined to bury it by a tree, or at a threeway crossroads. I personally think that you should dispose of items that hold onto negativity away from you because the intent is to get that crap away from our lives. 
In terms of ridding energies, this is a very strong method. It could be the egg‚Äôs multicultural significance, or its nature of being a vessel for life that makes it so powerful. In my personal experience, this can suck up spiritual attachments as well. 
Jason miller also stated this about eggs on the altar( protection and reversal magick pg 37) ‚Äú...an egg will take the hit of negative energy for you and go bad quickly or even break in the event of an attack‚Äù 
I personally had this happen to me when changing out my egg. It exploded in my face and I felt such a release of negative energy that improved my life many months after the fact. Rotten egg blew up in my face, changed my life. Wuwu stuff is weird... 

Reading Tea leaves/ coffee grounds in a vessel

Reading Bone cracks/ throwing

Items in your kitchen to rid bad energies:

I will be quoting a lot from Scott Cunningham‚Äôs Encyclopedia of magical Herbs, so assume all quotes are from the book unless stated otherwise. This just saves my typing hand from cramps and tendonitis. I‚Äôm going to be organizing these common kitchen items by element. I instinctively go for the items associated with my personal elements and gender inclination. Your mileage may vary. Do you.

Salt-

 Earth Element

Salt has been used for purification for thousands of years. Its nature prevents the growth of pathogens, draws out moisture,  and preserves food. Energetically, this helps rid the user of bad juju and protects them in ritual. There are many different ways to use salt to help purify yourself like scrubs in the shower, adding it to bath water, or combining other ingredients to make it even stronger or specialized for your needs. 
In the sources below, I include many different salt types and their uses.


The element of fire

Nettle-



(caution: Never touch or eat raw nettle. Nettle is only safe to consume and handle when dried or cooked.)
Drinking as a tea found in a healthfood store is my favorite method. ‚ÄúThe protective powers of the nettle have long been used in magic. To remove a curse and send it back, stuff a poppet with nettle, or carry some in a sachet‚Äù.This will not only get rid of it, but return to sender, so use caution. 

Onion-

‚ÄúHalved or quartered onions, placed in the house will absorb negativity and evil, as well as disease.‚Äù Place an onion under your bed or sink to absorb negativity. 

Black Pepper-

‚ÄúPepper is added to amulets as a protectant against Evil Eye,‚Äù, ‚ÄúMixed with salt and scattered about the property it dispels evil‚Äù

Radish- 

‚ÄúWhen carried, the radish protects against Evil Eye‚Äù

Black Tea-
When drank as a tea, it  is used for protection.

Rosemary-

‚Äú...when burned, emits powerful cleansing and purifying vibrations‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhen placed beneath a pillow rosemary ensures good sleep and drives away nightmares.‚Äù 
‚ÄúLaid under the bed it protects the sleeper from all harm‚Äù 
This is also the incense used in the catholic church as the smoke swung about during ceremonies. The smoke is often used to cleanse before magick. Planting rosemary in your yard protects it. 

Tobacco-
‚ÄúBurning tobacco as an incense purifies the area of all negativity and spirits (good and bad)‚Äù
Tobacco is often used as an initial offering in Native American rituals as part of the Four Sacred Medicines. 

The element of Water

Water-

Water is naturally cleansing by our association. All over the world, we use it to cleanse ourselves and wash our possessions. It takes away filth and is a mixing agent in a myriad of substances we use everyday. It is essential for life as we know it. 
You can do a hell of a lot with simple baths. Add one of more ingredients to the water to suit your needs. Traditionally, you want to keep it an odd number. The power of threes is simple and effective. 

Spearmint-

‚ÄúFor protection while asleep stuff a pillow or mattress‚Ä¶‚Äù

Thyme- 
‚ÄúPlaced beneath a pillow,  it ensures restful sleep and a pleasant lack of nightmares‚Äù
‚ÄúGreeks burned it in their temples to purify them‚Ä¶‚Äù 
‚Äú...Burned prior to magic rituals to cleanse the area..‚Äù

Tomato-

‚ÄúWhen a tomato is placed on the windowsill or any other household entrance it repels evil from entering‚Äù

Wintergreen-
‚ÄúWhen sprinkled in the home it removes hexes and curses, especially when mixed with mint‚Äù


The element of Air

Parsely- 

‚ÄúParsely is used in purification baths, and those to stop all misfortune‚Äù 

Rice-

‚ÄúBramins carried rice as amulet against evil, and a small jar of rice placed near the entrance guards against it.‚Äù

Sage-

‚ÄúTo guard yourself against contracting the dreaded Evil Eye wear a small horn filled with Sage.‚Äù 
White sage is considered one of the Four Medicines in many Native American cultures. However, when utilizing a Native American approach tobacco is always used first as an offering. Sage is used for clearing negative energy as well as clearing homes. 
Sage is also used for Smudging and I will link how to do so respectfully. 

No element

Turmeric-

Turmeric stains! Use caution.

(Hawaiian magic) ‚Äú...salt water and turmeric are mixed together and then sprinkled in the area to be purified‚Äù 
‚Äú...scattered on the floor or about the magic circle for protection‚Äù

Crab shell

Crabs are known for walking backwards and will return to sender. Use caution. 

Egg shells 

Egg shells are used to protect the user just like it protects the yoke. 

Clean your spaces

Energy has a tendency to stick to dirt and dust. I recommend tidying up before you use a floor wash or smoke cleanse in your spaces. Open windows, let in fresh air and life-giving sunlight. 
 This will boost your mental health as well. 

Clean your social circles

Drop anyone who is toxic and unsupportive. During this time you need to focus on yourself and keep only people who uplift you close

Do anything that will be a boost to your mental health

Go outside, eat well, exercise, buy yourself something nice, get a hair cut, whatever brings positive energy into your life. 

Additional Examples of cleansing and protection rituals using everyday items
You can definitely use examples, but I encourage you to do whatever you feel inclined toward. You subconsciously know what you need already. Go for what you‚Äôre drawn to. 

Protection Bath-

(Jason Miller‚Äôs Protection and Reversal Magick pg 72) A bath consisting of salt, ammonia, and vinegar. Use caution. Ammonia is toxic! Jason states, ‚Äúthe salt and vinegar can be equal parts of about a half a cup or so, but the ammonia should only be a teaspoon diluted in at least four gallons of water, as it is toxic and harmful if inhaled‚Äù 
I personally have never used this bath as typically salt and water works wonders, especially over a course of several days. 

Cleansing baths/scrubs

Salt and water mixed in the bath or lightly scrubbing salt on the body during a shower.

Salt, 1 to two cups of strong coffee added to the bath. 

Salt, Rosemary, and sage added to the bath or use the combination of herbs and salt as a scrub.

Add nettle tea to the bath or pour warm(not hot) nettle tea in the shower.
Use caution. This returns to sender. 

Black salt and Lemon
Depending on how you make your black salt, you might want to use it as a shower scrub instead. 
A quick bath safe recipe for black salt is salt, protective herb ashes (sage, rosemary, nettle) and salt. You may wish to add additional ingredients or cook it down in case iron. Up to you. 
After adding black salt, zest a lemon. 


Exorcism Wash (floor)
‚ÄúGarlic, pepper, vinegar‚Äù (Jason Miller‚Äôs Protection and Reversal Magick pg 94) 

Smoke cleanses
Never burn herbs out of sight. 

Burn a firesafe container with rosemary and fan the smoke over your body. 

Burn a firesafe container and fan over body. 

Egg cleanse
I'm adding this again to make it easy to find.

Sit with an egg, rub on your body from head to toe while meditating on it taking your energetic burden away. Dispose of the egg away from your property.

I'm searching for recommendations on a suitable venue near Andel for a small group language lesson. Ideally, I'm looking for:

* A quiet coffee shop or caf√©
* Spacious tables to accommodate three people comfortably
* A calm atmosphere conducive to learning
* Located in or around the Andel area

The space would be used for a language lesson with my teacher and one other student. We need enough room to spread out materials and engage in conversation without disturbing others.

Does anyone know of a place that fits these criteria? Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Episode 11: Eat, Puke, and Be Wary

""Previously, on Total Drama Revenge of the Island! An epic air battle turned into an epic fail when Emma tried to take over Axel's sweet ride, costing her her shot at winning.""

""Axel fought for control, Noah fought with fire, and Lindsay fought with Axel as she used her immunity idol to give her the Hurl.""

The recap ended there, the scene cutting to a close-up of a pair of identical purple kites flying in the sky. ""We're down to the Final Four,"" Chris said as the shot cut to him and Chef standing on the Dock of Shame with the ends of the two kite's lines. ""Who's goin' to the finals?"" the host asked with a cheesy but excited tone, taking a pair of scissors out of his pocket. ""And who's gonna be cut loose?"" he asked, reaching over and cutting the line to Chef's kite, then laughing as it flew away. ""Haha, yeah, like that.""

Chef scowled angrily at him, but Chris ignored it. ""Find out right now, on Total! Drama! Revenge of the Island!""

(Theme Song)

The scene opened on a trio of pink birds singing together on a tree branch...until a mutant squirrel leaned out from behind the trunk and zapped them with its eye lasers. They were burnt to a crisp, and flew away as the squirrel laughed cruelly to the camera.

The camera quick-panned down to the ground, where Noah was standing at the base of the tree. The snarker pulled a knot tight in a rope and held it up, revealing the loop he'd made. ""And that should take care of that,"" he told himself. ""That shark had it out for me just because of something he can grow back.""

He heard muttering and smirked, and the camera quick-panned to show Shawn shaving a long piece of bark as if he were trying to make a weapon.

Confessional: Noah

""I was right about Axel having the immunity totem,"" Noah said. ""And while we forced her to play it by voting for her, it cost us Lindsay as well.""

""We have the second chance to get her kicked off tonight, and that'll require me asking Shawn and Emma for help,"" he said. ‚ÄúEmma helped me win the last challenge, and Shawn would want to get rid of Axel, but they could refuse to acquaint themselves with me given my smart mouth.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

The static cut back to Shawn working on his bark. He looked up when he heard Noah say ""Hey there Shawn. What‚Äôs with the spear you‚Äôre working on?""

""It's not a spear. It's a wooden stake,"" Shawn clarified. ""I still want to ward off any vampires that may come onto the island. I'm just missing some garlic.""

""And some dose of reality,"" Noah muttered. ""So you want to know who wrote you that note?""

""I'm still wondering about that,"" Shawn confirmed. ‚ÄúIt can't just be someone that's not on the island.‚Äù

""I'll answer that for you, Shawn,"" Noah told him. ""It was me.""

Shawn let out a huge gasp. ‚ÄúYou?! But you were in an alliance with Alejandro. Why'd you write it?‚Äù

""Cause I knew that Al was going to turn his back on me and I wanted to beat him to the punch,"" Noah said back. ‚ÄúHad it not been for me, you and me would've been the first two voted out in the merge and Alejandro would have control of the game.‚Äù

""I never thought you were capable of doing something this huge,"" Shawn admitted. ‚ÄúYou usually just stay in the background not doing anything, but you saved me from being eliminated. How can I repay you?‚Äù

""I'm starting an alliance with me, you, and Emma to make sure that Axel goes. Stick with me and we'll be the Final Three,"" Noah said as he walked off with a smirk, leaving a stunned Shawn behind.

Confessional: Shawn

""I should turn down the alliance offer, but Noah of all people helped me not become a victim of Alejandro,"" Shawn considered. ""Then again, this probably won't be as bad as I think it'll be.""

Confessional Ends

The scene moved to Noah walking up towards the lone cabin, where Emma was meditating on the steps. She quickly noticed him. ""What do you need? My morning meditations help me get into the right mood.""

""Yeah, sure,"" Noah said.

""Let me guess,"" Emma said as she uncrossed her legs. ""You want me to help you with eliminating Axel again?""

Noah smirked. ""Nail on the head. You did a satisfactory job letting me win the last challenge.""

""But what about Shawn? He likes to be alone,"" Emma wondered.

""Don't worry. I already got him on our side,"" Noah said.

""Are you going to double-cross me and Shawn?"" Emma asked suspiciously. ‚ÄúNo offense, but I don't know you that well.‚Äù

Noah sighed in light annoyance. ""I only double-crossed Alejandro, and that was because he was an eel. I assure you that I'm not gonna do the same to you guys,"" he told her before strolling off to the right.

Emma watched him go. It wasn't too long, however, before Axel walked by. ""Hey Emma!"" Axel called out, causing her to stop and glare at her.

""Now is not the time,"" Emma warned. ""Go away!""

""Hostile, aren't we?"" Axel said with a dry tone. ""I only eliminated Lindsay because I was simply protecting myself.""

Confessional: Axel

""Now that I don't have the immunity idol to save me, I'll have to focus on winning the challenge while not letting the others get to me,"" Axel confessed. ""It‚Äôs one of me against three of them, and this survivalist will make herself greater than three!""

Confessional Ends

""Challenge time!"" Chris called out in an almost sing-song voice as the scene cut to him, Chef, and the Final Four standing just outside the communal bathrooms. ""And since you've been abused so flagrantly,"" he said, walking past the wary four, ""today's challenge is a super safe fun challenge!"" The campers began to smile and cheer in genuine excitement.

""Get ready for bubbles, flowers, and cotton can-"" Chris continued, walking further away...and stepping in something unseen that caused him to yelp in shock and pain before being lifted into the air. The camera cut outward to show that he'd been caught in a snare trap attached to a tall pole that flung him in a high arc...and down through the roof of the bathroom.

The Final Four cringed in sympathy and disgust. ""No,"" Noah winced. ""That was my snare that just threw Chris into the washrooms...""

Chef raced to the bathroom door and opened it, quickly getting faced with the smells and noises coming from within. ""Woo-eee!"" he said, waving his hand in front of his face in disgust. ""I need five interns and a fire hose! ASAP!"" he called off-camera. ""We'll get you outta there soon,"" he told the host.

Chris coughed and nearly wretched. ""Those ungrateful puppets just crossed the line!"" he said from within the depths of the building. He took a breath, then continued with ""Remember your nasty challenges, Chef?"" he asked, the shot quickly cutting to the Final Four as they shared a nervous look. ""The ones that got the red lights?"" he added. ""Yeah, the light just turned green,"" he finished harshly.

Chef grinned, closed the door, and turned around. ""I'll bring the pain,"" he said, cackling evilly as lightning flashed, thunder cracked, and the music became higher and darker.

The Final Four gasped and cowered and turned their eyes skyward...only to see a bright sun and an almost cloudless sky. Though Chef kept laughing, their fear soon gave way to annoyance, and the shot cut over to show that the ominous effects had been created by a trio of interns ‚Äì a short young white woman with a high black ponytail switching a stagelight on and off, a young white man with long bangs waving a piece of sheet metal, and a young man of southeast Asian descent pulling a rope than raised and lowered a tarp above Chef.

After a few seconds, Chef finally stopped laughing. ""Okay, cool it,"" he told the interns.

The scene flashed ahead to a clearing in the woods, where each of the campers was standing behind what appeared to be portable kitchens made mostly of wood. ""Listen up, dirtbags,"" Chef said as he approached from the right, the camera zooming slowly in as he walked past Shawn, and then Axel, and then Noah, and then Emma. ""I'm gonna push you until you break. Then I'll take the filthy little broken bits and give 'em another good breakin'!"" He finally reached the end of the line.

""No wimps are gonna make it to my finale,"" he said solemnly before turning around to face Emma and roaring ""Do you understand?"" Emma gasped nervously. ""First challenge,"" Chef continued, ""the cook-off!""

""Cooking?"" Noah repeated dryly. ""We're not meant to do your job for you,"" he said before getting hit with a frying pan and toppling over with a grunt of pain.

""Shut it, or I'll shut it!"" Chef told him, catching the frying pan as it spun back on the rebound. ""Bring in the TD classic competitor!"" he called to the left, and the camera cut backward and panned over to show none other than Rodney, blindfolded and bound by rope to a hand truck being wheeled in by a short, fat, and bespectacled east Asian male intern.

""Hey, it's Rodney,"" Shawn said in awe.

Chef removed the boy's blindfold to reveal a look of panic in his eyes. ""No,"" Rodney moaned, ""not here! I made a promise to myself never to come back here after the first season was over!""

""Your contract disagrees, dough-boy,"" Chef told him, holding up an official-looking stack of paper. ""You slime buckets are gonna cook somethin' tasty,"" he looked back and told the campers, ""and this bag of mush will be the judge,"" he dropped the contract. ""You've got twenty minutes to make a tasty lunch with whatever you find on the island,"" he turned the rest of his body away from Rodney. ""I believe in eating locally,"" he admitted proudly. ""Ready?"" he asked the contestants with his usual harsh expression.

""Quick question,"" Emma raised her hand. ""What will he have for seasonings?""

Chef just ran over to her with two frying pans in hand, shouted ""Get cookin'!"", and banged the pans together. Emma flinched and yelped, then ran off.

Another flash shifted the scene into some part of the woods, where a three-eyed bear was casually scratching its back against a tree until it heard the panting and footfalls of someone approaching and ducked behind a large bush.

""Hmph,"" Noah huffed as he finally entered the scene and stopped to catch his breath and look around. ""A foraging challenge? I may be beat here since Axel and especially Shawn are experts at finding food,"" he said as he started walking forward again.

He soon came upon a tree with several small glowing mushrooms growing out of the side. ""Well,"" he smiled, ""I found something."" He reached out to grab them, but stopped partway and frowned. ""Actually, on second thought, those are probably poisonous. No matter,"" he told himself, turning around and walking away. He quickly came upon what looked like a blueberry bush, but when he reached out to pick some, a green tendril shot out and slapped his hand away, and the bush hissed at him.

""Okay...,"" he said, rubbing his hurting hand, ""I am beat here...""

The music trilled tensely as the shot cut to a close-up of a group small, glowing green mushroom growing on the bark of a tree. This time, however, they were soon scooped up by a hand that the camera cut outward to identify as Shawn's. ""Perfect,"" he said as he looked at his gains. ""These will make an excellent base for any number of dishes. Now I just need to find some kind of grain,"" he said, standing up straight and looking around.

He saw Axel approaching and rolled his eyes. ""Looking for cooking advice?"" the theorist asked with a hint of cynicism.

""I'm not a stereotypical housewife,"" Axel said in offense. ""And I wanted to talk about the vote. Emma gets the heave-ho, right?""

""No. I plan on booting you,"" Shawn said. ""And no form of manipulation will make me change my mind.""

""I only had to manipulate Mike into thinking that Cameron told me about his secret so I could gain his trust until the team swap happened,"" Axel rebutted. ‚ÄúBut should I win the challenge today, you should help me get rid of Emma. She tried to sabotage me in the last challenge and she might do the same to you despite being nice-looking.‚Äù

""Do you honestly expect me to believe that I'd vote off Emma over Noah?"" Shawn answered with a raised eyebrow. ""I'm not above making risky decisions, but that is something I will not do.""

""Fine,"" Axel conceded. ""We'll vote for Noah if that'll suit you, but don't think that you can give your full trust to that girl."" She crossed her arms and walked away, leaving Shawn to glare.

The shot quickly cut back to Axel, however, to show her looking back with a sly smile...before slamming headfirst into what the camera quickly zoomed out to reveal was a giant two-headed mutant rabbit. It roared at her, she screamed, and the music turned deep and ominous as she turned back and ran for her life.

The scene flashed to the communal bathrooms, where the female intern was now leaning against a pipe by herself with a cup of coffee in hand. ""Helloooo~o?"" Chris asked from inside the building. ""Someone give me a hand! I'm almost free!"" The intern just looked at her nails and whistled. ""Uh-oh, oh no!"" the host said in sudden alarm, the shot cutting in to the shocked intern as she listened to her boss slip on something and fall into something watery again.

""Whyyyyy?"" he began to cry, earning a smiled from the braces-wearing intern. ""Oh wh-h-hyyyy?""

She took a sip of coffee.

Another flash took the focus back to the woods, the camera stationed right behind a tree and catching Shawn running past from the left with a pair of laser squirrels gnawing on his head, then Axel running by in the opposite direction pursued by the giant two-headed rabbit, and then Noah from the left again struggling with the attacking vines of an uprooted bush.

Emma ran in from the right, and skidded to a stop as she saw the scene unfolding. ""This is why a vegetarian meal is a good thing,"" she said to herself. ""Salad won't try to kill me.""

The scene returned to the portable outdoor kitchens with a close-up of Emma, humming to herself as she tossed her salad with a wooden spoon and fork. The music turned tense as green tendrils sprouted from the bowl, grabbed both the prep girl and the spoon, then repeatedly whacked the blonde on the head.

The scene cut to Noah, standing with a pile of red and blue berries and a pan at the ready. ""These shouldn't be poisonous, but you never know with these mutants,"" he said as he scooped up a handful and looked at them more closely. He dumped them into the pan with an expectant cringe, but they merely sizzled. ""Okay, they should be good for the tart,"" he said with a smile.

The camera came to Shawn, standing with a bowl of glowing mushrooms at the ready. ""It's not a pie,"" he said to himself, ""but a quiche should be fine."" Axel walked over to the conspiracy nut and raised an eyebrow.

Confessional: Axel

""A quiche?"" Axel asked incredulously. ""Lame, but it's cooking? How hard can it be?""

Confessional Ends

The static cut to Axel as she stirred something in her pan, then tasted it. The survivalist made a noise of distaste and looked around then ducked down behind her counter and came back up with a three-eyed mutant frog in hand, and squeezed it so that a disgusting-looking pink slime spurted out of its mouth and in to the pan.

Next, the camera cut to Emma getting attacked by her salad. She finally groaned in frustration, then grabbed a large wooden mallet from under her table and hit the bowl a couple of times. The tendrils released her, flailed for a bit, then went limp as Emma put her hands on her hips and smiled.

Confessional: Noah

""I'll admit it,"" Noah told the confessional camera. ""I don't really have a lot of experience with actually cooking food. But you can't go wrong with berries.""

Confessional Ends

A lilting tune was playing as the static cut away to Noah, who was now pouring his cooked fruit mixture into a tart crust. He spread it out evenly with a wooden spoon, but as he turned his back on it to look at the others, the shot zoomed in and the music turned ominous as it began to bubble slightly.

An angelic tune was playing as the scene cut away to Shawn as his oven dinged. With a pair of blue oven mitts over his hands, he quickly bent down and took out his quiche. The shot cut in for a close-up of the dish, putting a radiant gold-and-orange background behind it to emphasize its rather picturesque quality ‚Äì a perfect unburnt brown.

The shot cut to Axel as her own oven dinged. Like Shawn, she bent down and picked up her quiche. The same tune played, but the angelic chorus was replaced by an ominous pipe organ as the camera cut to a close-up of her dish - looking the same as Shawn's but with a dark sickly green crust - against the same radiant background.

""Three, two, one,"" Chef counted down as the scene faded forward to him standing at the ready with a nervous Rodney still bound at his side. ""Spatulas down. Well, dish it up cupcakes! Move! Move! Move!"" he commanded, and the camera zoomed out as the Final Four scrambled in to a line with their dishes in hand.

The shot zoomed back in on Rodney, Shawn stepping up to him first. ""Today, I present you a quiche,"" the conspiracy nut said as he presented his dish to the bound country boy.

""Mmm,"" Rodney smiled, taking a whiff.

""...made from the finest toxic mushrooms on the island,"" Shawn finished, looking up with an expectant grin.

Rodney yelped in alarm.

""Next!"" Chef ordered.

Emma was next, and she presented her bowl of greens...with a few larger black things scattered throughout almost like croutons. ""How about a nice salad?"" the preppy girl asked with a confident smile.

The 'croutons' promptly stood up, revealing themselves as spiders as they crawled out of the bowl and on to Rodney. The unwilling judge shuddered in fear.

""Or not...,"" Emma told him nervously before sighing and walking away.

She was replaced by Noah, who watched his ally leave with a frown before holding up what he'd made so Rodney could get a better look. ""It's my first time making one,"" he said as he held up his tart. ""A wildberry tart.""

The music spiked dramatically just then, and the bubbling tart erupted in a massive pillar of flame that made both Noah and Rodney gasp in shock. ""Oops!""

Rodney just whimpered some more. ""Next!"" Chef hollered, and Axel pulled Noah away before stepping up herself.

""I made a quiche too,"" Axel said. ""Now eat it!""

The music spiked dramatically just then, and an eye stalk popped out of the dish and made Rodney scream.

Rodney wailed, bursting his arms free of their bonds with ease and quickly untying his legs. He ran off, leaving behind a wide-eyed Chef.

""Welp, looks like we just lost our taste-tester,"" he said, his expression returning to his usual gruff glare. ""Rule change!"" he called out as he looked back towards the campers. ""You've gotta eat all of your own weird grub.""

""Urrgh...,"" Emma, Noah, and Axel said in disgust while Shawn just smirked.

""You hurl, you lose,"" Chef told them before the camera panned back his way. ""Who's got guts of steel and who's gonna blast a barf bomb?"" He asked it. ""It's a throw-up throw-down, when we come back. On Total! Drama! Revenge of the Island!"" An ominous chanting rose up in the background as he said the title with a grin.

(Commercial Break)

""Alright, con-pest-ants,"" Chef said with a light snicker as the camera slowly zoomed in from a long-distance shot of him standing behind the campers, who were now seated along on side of a wooden table with their dishes in front of them, ""it's time to eat the disgusting crud you cooked up before the break!""

The shot zoomed in on Emma's salad, which still had a few spiders crawling in it. ""Whoever finishes their meal first, without spewing,"" Chef continued as the camera panned up to Emma's nervous face, ""wins the challenge."" She looked over at Noah, who was also looking nervous. Chef laughed, and added ""Man, this is gonna be nasty,"" as the bookworm looked down at his tart and prodded it with a fork. The tart bubbled hastily at him, and he looked scared.

At the other side of the table, Shawn looked excitedly down at his quiche while Axel gazed at hers. Axel saw the properly cooked quiche with a grin. ""Nice quiche. Our minds do think alike,"" she said to him. ""Hey look! I see an army of robots coming!""

""You can‚Äôt pull that one on me,"" Shawn scowled. ‚ÄúI know better now thanks to Alejandro.‚Äù

""Darn,"" Axel grumbled.

""Three, two, one,"" Chef counted down, the camera moving back to the middle to better show him standing between Noah and Axel. At the end of his countdown, he blew an airhorn, then yelled ""Eat it!""

Noah went first, grabbing a bit of the tart, sticking it in his mouth, gagging, and fainting shortly after his eyes rolled back.

Next was Shawn, who began to cough soon after his first forkful of quiche. He hacked up one of the mushrooms that he discovered earlier. ""Yeah, the mushrooms may have been a mistake.""

The shot cut to Axel next, just as she was putting her first piece of quiche in her mouth. Her eyes promptly popped open.

The music ramped up dramatically as Axel turned and vomited on the ground. The shot cut to Noah, now standing up, vomiting, and then to Shawn doing the same. The music leveled off as quickly as it had arisen, and the footage skipped ahead to Emma finishing off the rest of her salad, coughing out one of the same kind of spiders that had put off Rodney, and watched as it scuttled away.

""Challenge is over!"" Chef declared, leaning over and raising the blonde's arm. ""Emma wins!""

The other three were shown groaning at the other end of the table with the remains of their dishes, and Axel wretched again.

Confessional: Noah

‚ÄúWho knew berries could be so cruel to my digestive system?‚Äù Noah asked with a groan.

Confessional Ends

""That's why she doesn't have to wear one of these tracking collars,"" Chef continued immediately, showing off the three metal collars hanging loosely on his left arm. A drum was struck as he threw each one in turn, and the shot cut back over to reveal that they'd locked around the necks of Shawn, Axel, and Noah.

""Challenge part two,"" Chef told them. ""I give you...'Dork Hunter'!"" With an eager look on his face, he showed off the GPS map he was now holding. The camera zoomed in, showing something like a topographic map centered on the Dock of Shame. ""The challenge is simple,"" he explained as four red icons bearing the faint faces of the remaining campers appeared on the screen. ""You're the dorks, I'm the hunter."" A larger icon bearing Chef's face appeared to the left of the four, and the map screen started panning upward with a dotted red arrow marking the way. ""You run off into the woods, I hunt you down. First dork to the flagpole wins."" The pan stopped a little ways after, and a large red circled 'X' started flashing on the screen.

""Pray that you make it,"" the cook said, the camera finally cutting from the map back to him ‚Äì and the bazooka he was now carrying, ""before the Dork Hunter blasts you into a whole new dimension of pain!"" The shot suddenly moved in for a close-up as he held up a can bearing his face on the label, along with a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with a fiery background. ""Rocket-Propelled Spaghetti Cannon. Featuring my own special recipe,"" he loaded the can into the bazooka, ""Chef Hatchet's In-Your-Face Extra Spicy Spaghetti."" The shot cut back outward to show that he was now in the driver's seat of the show's jeep. ""Dinner is served...in your face!"" he said, becoming suddenly aggressive again and firing the cannon.

A massive ball of spaghetti and meat sauce shot forward, the four campers barely ducking in time. It hit the long-banged intern as he mowed the common area, sending him flying backward into a rock formation. ""Aww! Aww! It burns!"" he cried out in pain, pinned to the rock by sizzling-hot pasta.

Chef cackled in delight. ""Spicy! You got twenty minutes to run, hide, and say your prayers,"" he said over a shot of the Final Four, who nervously turned from the intern to their tormentor. ""Now move out!"" he commanded, following up with another shot from his cannon that forced the campers to scream and scatter into the woods ‚Äì Axel and Shawn taking a path further into the woods while Noah followed Emma down a way closer to the camera. A third shot of pasta landed on a rock separating the two paths, and Chef giggled.

The scene flashed to the back of the communal outhouse, where all three male interns ‚Äì including the one with long bangs ‚Äì were now standing around.

""What's taking those interns so long?"" Chris asked angrily, still stuck within the bathroom. The fat intern and southeast Asian intern snickered, but their companion ‚Äì down on one knee in front of a pipe ‚Äì quickly shushed them. ""There's no way they could‚Äôve forgot about me!"" Chris yelled. ""I OWN THEM!""

As he roared, the banged intern raised a connecting hose out of the ground and hooked it to the pipe, and the southeast Asian intern opened the valve. After a few seconds of gurgling, Chris cried out in alarm. ""More sewage?!"" He took a deep breath, then screamed ""HEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLPPPPPP!""

The shot cut to a close-up of a few lavender-colored tulips, which were promptly covered by a stream of vomit. ""That settles it,"" Noah said, clutching his stomach as he stood back up and wiped the puke from his mouth. ""I‚Äôm removing tarts from my diet for a while,"" he added, straightening up.

Emma dashed into the scene and came to a halt. ""Hey Noah. Did you have any luck removing your shock collar?""

""I haven‚Äôt even touched it,"" Noah said. ""I don‚Äôt want to experience a voltage surprise.""

""Let me help you out,"" Emma offered.

""Why and how are you going to do that?"" Noah asked.

‚ÄúBecause we have to look out for each other in this alliance, duh,‚Äù Emma rolled her eyes, ‚Äúand those collars give out a shock if someone tries to remove them. I'm thinkin' they can only take so many shocks before they wire out.""

‚ÄúDo you have a watch on you?‚Äù Noah wondered. ‚ÄúI could reconfigure it to send out a small electromagnetic pulse, re-route the battery feed, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but I do have hairspray,‚Äù Emma smiled as she whipped out her own can.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how this will go,‚Äù Noah deadpanned.

Confessional: Emma

""Let‚Äôs just say that I'm glad my hairspray is noxious enough to short out machines,"" Emma explained.

Confessional: Shawn

""Tracking collars?!"" Shawn asked incredulously. ""Really?! I don't know what's worse. This, or getting electrocuted by a robot!""

Any further complaining was cut off by his collar shocking him.

The static cut to Chef cackling to himself with his spaghetti bazooka at the ready, and the camera panned ahead to Shawn running through the woods and looking back with panic on his face.

""Chef!"" Shawn yelled as a shot of pasta flew past him. ""Wait!"" he yelled as he narrowly dodged another one.

The camera cut in for a close-up of the beanie boy. ""Please!"" he begged, just before he skidded to a stop near an ominous gray sky with a gasp. The camera pulled back to show that he was at the edge of a cliff.

Chef drove to block the path, trapping Shawn. ""Hunt's over Dork!"" he taunted at him.

""Wait!"" Shawn said desperately. ""I give up!""

""Let's make it official,"" Chef said with a grin before he fired. The pasta ball hit Shawn in the face, causing him to back up a few feet and fall off the cliff with a scream.

""Maybe I'll come back for him,"" Chef said before grinning. ""If I remember."" He backed out of the clearing with a chuckle, and the camera panned to the bottom of a ravine to show Shawn lying on the ground.

Confessional: Shawn

Shawn facepalmed and sighed. ""Why did I ever think that a hulking man like Chef would show any mercy?"" he said to himself.

Confessional Ends

""I may have a tracking collar, but Chef not being around means I'm gonna win,"" Axel said to herself, a smug grin on her face as she walked through the woods at a rather casual pace. ""I just wish that Shawn was more gullible so that I could snag his quiche and not have to wear this collar.""

Confessional: Axel

""That's the thing with the remaining competition,"" Axel confessed. ""They all need each other to get ahead. I don't need anybody but me, and friends will only slow me down,"" she added. ""Teamwork does not make the dream of having a weapon room work.""

Confessional Ends

The camera cut to Emma running through the woods as a familiar groan filled the air.

The preppy woman skidded to a stop and looked around. ""Shawn?"" she asked worriedly.

""Emma!"" Shawn called out, gaining both her and the camera's attention. The shot quick-panned to show Shawn barely hanging on to the edge of the cliff.

""Hold on!"" Emma yelled. ""I'll help you up!""

The scene flashed to a close-up of Chef's GPS map, showing only his own blinking icon. ""Now where the heck did the mouthy boy go?"" he grumbled, the shot cutting back to show him sitting in his jeep in a different part of the woods. He scrolled the map around with his finger, then stopped and smiled. ""Hah! That fool didn't even think to make a run for it,"" he said, the shot cutting back to the screen to show Noah to Chef's south.

""Better sneak up on foot,"" he said with a sneaky snicker as he hopped out of the jeep, the pasta cannon strapped to his back. ""I'll bag him before he knows what hit him, and then I'll take out the others too,"" he said, chuckling darkly as he walked off into the woods.

The shot lingered on his jeep and the music turned eerie, and Noah leaned out from the shadowy forest background with a smirk on his face.

Another flash took the scene back to Axel as she stopped in her tracks suddenly, and the perspective moved behind her to show a checkered flag sticking out of a small hill with an alarm light on top.

""Well what do you know?"" she smirked to herself. ""The finish line."" She started running and the camera cut to a close-up of her face. ""Now all I have to do is- agh!""

She was suddenly hoisted up in a net trap. ""What the? Chef didn't say anything about traps!""

Noah snorted and came into the shot from the right. ""No, he didn't,"" the bookworm said with a smirk. ""You activated one of the traps I set up to catch Fang.""

""Get me down from here!"" Axel yelled.

""After getting people kicked off the way you have?"" Noah asked with a raised eyebrow as he brushed some dirt off his shirt. ""I think you got what you deserved. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to-""

Like with Axel, he was cut off suddenly. However, he was cut off by Fang appearing directly in front of him.

""... run for my life,"" he finished, turning away from the flag and running away while screaming.

Fang chased the bookworm a few feet before he suddenly ran in an arc around a strangely miscolored patch of grass. The mutant shark, however, stepped on it and fell into a pit. The shark's head appeared from within every so often, but it was clear the trap was deep enough that nothing that fell in could get out.

""Yes!"" he called back at the shark. ""That's one trap for you,"" he turned back to the flagpole, ""and one victory for me!""

A spaghetti shot hit the side of a tree right in front of him, shocking the camper and causing the dramatic background score to resume. ""Guess again, sucka!"" Chef cried out, drawing the camera's attention to the tree branch he was standing in. He descended into a cackle as the snarker looked his way, and fired another shot.

Noah yelped and ducked, narrowly avoiding being hit by a past-blast that wound up hitting Fang as the shark tried to jump out of the pit. ""Seriously?!"" Noah yelled. ""Now what am I supposed to do?!""

""Run for it!"" the familiar voice of Emma cried, catching the attention of Noah and the camera. Emma and Shawn were jogging with bright smiles on their faces as they got closer to the finish.

Noah smirked, and moved to grab Shawn's ankle as he ran past. He managed to wrap his hand around the theorist's foot and succeeded in being dragged a couple of feet... and over the pit where he'd trapped Fang.

""That's not good,"" Noah moaned in horror just before he fell in, the sounds of snarling, fabric tearing, and pained yelling telling the story of what was happening well enough.

""We're almost there!"" Shawn yelled out... just before Axel fell from the sky and landed on them, causing the two to gape at her in shock as the trap that she'd been caught in unraveled.

""Finally!"" Axel said in relief as she got to her feet. ""I‚Äôll be seeing one of you guys in the catapult!"" she yelled as she ran toward the finish.

Emma growled. ""Oh no you don‚Äôt,"" she yelled as she and Shawn started chasing Axel.

The music turned bright and heroic as the duo jogged past Axel... only for the latina to front flip and slide along the ground and hit the flagpole with her hand. The siren on top of the flagpole immediately began to flash and spin and sound for all to hear.

""And that‚Äôs how a survivalist wins,"" Axel cheered as a drumroll transitioned the background music into a victory theme.

""Game's over,"" Chef declared as the camera cut to him. ""Axel wins immunity.""

""And what about us?!"" Shawn asked as he and Emma stood to the side. ""What do we win?""

Chef smirked and readied his cannon. ""Dinner,"" he said darkly just before firing one last time. The camera stayed on his face as a splat was heard and Shawn and Emma cried out 'Hey!"" and 'My head!!' respectively.

The shot finally cut to Noah as he climbed out of his pit trap, now with a black eye and his clothes in tatters.

Confessional: Noah

""With that shark practically attacking me and claiming his tooth back, I believe that our conflict should come to an end,"" Noah stated. ""I never had any use for it anyway.""

Confessional Ends

A handful of drumbeats marked the transition to the marshmallow ceremony, the Final Four assembled on the front row of seats with Noah furthest left still in tattered clothes and a bandaged torso, then Shawn with a small bandage around the top of his head, then Emma with a bandage around her head, and lastly an injury-free Axel furthest right. And although enough time had passed for the torches that ringed the area to be lit, Chef stood alone in front of the oil drum podium with his usual hazmat suit-strongbox ensemble.

""Elimination time, dorks!"" he told the campers. ""One of you is going home tonight, except for Axel, who has immunity."" The shot cut to Noah, Shawn, and Emma glaring as a pan over showed Axel smiling.

""And I deserve every single ounce of it,"" Axel gloated.

""Yeah, no you don‚Äôt,"" Shawn replied.

""Zip it,"" Chef interrupted, drawing the campers attention back to him as he held up four note cards. ""Now to the votes,"" he said, looking down at the cards as the music turned tense and trilling. ""We got one vote for Noah..."" the bookworm rolled his eyes, ""one for Emma..."" the preppy girl‚Äôs glare intensified, ""and one for Shawn..."" the conspiracy nut was the only one of the night to look nervous.

""And the final vote goes to...""

The tension increased in the music as Chef purposely drew out his pause, and the camera cut from worried Shawn, to annoyed Emma, to impatient Noah, and finally back to Chef.

""Noah,"" he read.

""Oh well. I expected this would be coming,"" Noah huffed before the Toxic Marshmallow of Loserdom was thrown his way; he yelped and swerved out of the way, letting it drop onto the ground.

Confessional: Noah

""I knew my time was up once Axel won that immunity,"" Noah said in the confessional. ""Shawn and Emma are closer to each other than they are to me, and it‚Äôd be OOC for them to backstab each other.""

Confessional: Shawn

Shawn sighed. ""Axel is still in the game, but me and Emma working together should guarantee our safety in the game.""

Confessional: Axel

""About time he went home!"" Axel grinned. ""By the way, I voted for Shawn because I knew that he and Emma would vote for Noah and Noah would do the same to Emma. Just to spice things up.""

Confessionals End

The static cut away to the Hurl of Shame, Noah sitting in the bucket with Chef grinning cockily next to him and the Final Three watching a little way up the dock.

""I love being the Hurl Master of this game,"" Chef said eagerly.

""And that's going to be on pause,"" Chris said, descending to the dock on his jetpack to the shock of Chef and Noah.

""Chris?!"" the Final Three said together in shock.

""Yup,"" Chris replied with his handle on the catapult's lever, ""I'm the Hurl Master around here! You see Noah,"" he addressed the loser, ""the Hurl of Shame is both shameful and painful. So, I arranged for a friend to share your journey.""

The Sam clone burst out of the water and landed inside the catapult next to a surprised Noah, who gulped once he saw the grin that the clone was giving him.

""It‚Äôs my way of saying thanks. For flinging me into a pit of poo!"" Chris said furiously and pulled the lever. Noah was launched into the night with the clone, screaming as they both disappeared into the distance.

""Chris, good to have you back, man,"" Chef told the host, walking over with a slice of glowing green quiche on a plate. ""I even saved you some quiche,"" he said, putting a hand on the smaller man's shoulder and smiling.

""Chef, you are the man,"" Chris grinned before swiping the quiche and shoving it into his mouth in one piece. He gulped it down quickly...but quickly wretched and vomited into a hole in the dock because of it.

Chef smirked. ""You are the Hurl Master,"" he said as the series's capstone theme began to play.

""Who will be hurled next,"" Chris said sickly, holding his stomach and looking distressed. ""How much are they gonna hurl before we hurl them? And when will I stop hurling?"" he asked, putting a hand over his bulging mouth before bending over and puking again. ""Find out next time,"" he stood back up and said, ""on Total! Drama! Revenge, of the Island!""

The sound of him vomiting again was heard over the final long-distance shot of the island.

(Unofficial ridgewood aita post),"I'm really trying to get more of a temperature chrck than to kick a cancellation off the ground. I went in with my wife (I'm white; she's brown) for a cup of coffee when they first opened up. We spoke to the owner about whether we could work on our laptops while Honeymoon was busy and they said yes, as long as we ordered a few drinks and moved to the bar when the lunch rush began.
So we did that. The lunch rush started about an hour later, and we were getting ready to free up a table and move to the bar. The owner (the Turkish man with insanely white teeth) came over to tell us to move. We told him we were doing that. At this point he began addressing only my wife and insisting that she move to the bar. She told him she was trying to, but that he was actively blocking her way, and he started to shout at her. At this point I got involved and told him to step away from her if he wanted us out of his restaurant and he laughed like I was crazy. We went to Honeymoon-- complained about it to the staff.

That must have been about a year ago, maybe more. We've actually gone back since. It started as a fuck you to the owner, but the rest of the staff are very kind to us. I wanted to see if anyone else had any bad experiences with him, or if maybe we just caught him on a bad day. To be fair, I knew he wasn't thrilled we hadn't ordered food, but I thought we'd come to a compromise.",0,1737910566.0,ridgewood,16,0.5,False

Sundays are for despair. They signal the start of another week that leads nowhere, that yields nothing but emptiness, sadness and deep seated restlessness of the soul, because it's missing a part if itself. 

Sundays were supposed to be for long snuggle sessions as we lose the struggle to get out of bed. Sundays were for easy mornings and family breakfasts. Sundays were supposed to be for recharge and rest before the beginning of the work week.

I got a LEEP procedure 16 days ago where they surgically removed some tissue of my cervix. Basically the entire ‚Äútip‚Äù of it; about the size of a thumbprint is what my OB said. 

I was fine for the first few days, no bleeding or cramping at all.

Got my period day 5 post-op‚Äî it was pretty regular for me but had some extra cramps at the beginning and less clear stringy cervical mucus throughout. 

Day 5 of my cycle (no longer bleeding but sort of brown discharge), I started seeing the black ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù- looking stuff come out (expected after LEEP). Then after about 36 hrs of that I started spotting quite a bit. And it hasn‚Äôt stopped.

Are there any herbs that could potentially support my healing / relieve the bleeding? 

They say spotting & light bleeding for up to 3-4 weeks is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù after LEEP. I have sensory issues, though, so at this point I‚Äôm already struggling. It‚Äôs not super painful, but I‚Äôm extremely uncomfortable physically and emotionally. I just want to sleep all day every day until it ends. ",2,1737909785.0,herbalism,2,1.0,False

The first year (2023) was amazing‚Äîwe met a few times, had great conversations, and really connected. However, since she moved to Pune for a job in January 2024, things have taken a turn. We've been fighting more and more, both in person and over calls. It‚Äôs reached a point where we argue almost every other day when we‚Äôre together.

Most fights stem from her insecurities and fear of losing me. She often feels I don‚Äôt show her enough love and affection. I try hard to be mindful and avoid repeating past mistakes, but in the last few months, even small things trigger arguments. For example:

* When I responded ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù on Chat to a female friend‚Äôs ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù
* When I asked my female friend and her husband for coffee before asking her.
* When I wished her a happy birthday 12‚Äì15 minutes late because she was talking to a friend.
* When I said a Bhojpuri actress looks prettier than Zendaya.

During fights, I initially try to defend myself stating that i love her and the reason she is upset is stupid, but when things spiral, and i feel don't have anything to defend, I either cry alone or raise my voice (which makes things worse and make her more insecure). Most fights end with her acknowledging her insecurity as the root cause and me admitting I need to express more affection. But despite my efforts, the fights are increasing, and it‚Äôs draining for both of us.

The most hurtful thing is that when we talk about the reason for the fight while she‚Äôs in a good mood and not feeling insecure, she still blames me for not acting correctly when it happened.

I'm using 18g of beans, and trying for a 1:2 ratio, so 36g of espresso. I'm doing a manual extraction, so I'm controlling the water flow, and I stop when I hit 36g of espresso. I've ground my beans at 1.0.0, 1.3.0, 1.4.0 and 1.7.0 (referencing the [j ultra grind chart](https://1zpresso.coffee/grind-setting/) for espresso range) just experimentally trying to get any difference between shots where I could then dial in from, but the grind doesn't seem to make any difference (which I know is impossible). Every shot I pull appears to me to be overextracted (dark and what I think tastes very bitter), but is extracting within 12-14 seconds, which (to my newbie brain) should be underextracted, and would suggest that I'm grinding too coarse at all of those grind sizes? The only difference I've been able to get is that at 1.0.0, the grind appears to be too fine to get much water through, and I only got 3.5g of espresso before the machine auto shuts off (even though I'm doing a manual extraction).

I just sat down and crunched the numbers. I will be spending an additional $250 a month on gas and spending an additional 50 hours in the car every month. My family gym membership is $115 a month so I will be canceling that. I go to a local gym so this will be money out of the pockets of a small business owner, but no fear - it will go to paying for gas. Also, I could probably find a way to still afford the gym, but I would have no time with all the hours I spend in the car to find time to go. 

I now will no longer be able to drop my kid off at their weekly extracurricular activity at a child‚Äôs gym, also run by a small business owner, so I will not be paying the $55 a week I provide for that. 

My child also attends a weekly art class after school. Guess what? Cancelling that. And you guessed it - small business owner. So they‚Äôll be missing my $30 a week. 

No, I will not be siphoning money toward childcare as my mother has agreed to be with my child before and after school (I am fortunate for that). She does not drive, but I will pay for her to Uber to my house. Thankfully, this will only be an every other week thing since I am a single mom and my child‚Äôs father has her every other week. 

I will not be walking to my local coffee shop in the morning like I did a few times a week, because I need to save money, so that‚Äôs $6 every few days I used to spend that I won‚Äôt be spending anymore at my local coffee shop.

Instead, I will subsist on a small lunch I bring to the office.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for 9 months now. A little back story we met on tinder and started just casual hooking up and then once it got to 4 months one night I asked him if someone had to ask u what I was to him what he would say and he said his girlfriend so since then I guess I‚Äôve been his girlfriend. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel and I‚Äôm on the fence with things and I need some advice - he lives in a share house with 2 other girls and has 2 kids - ( 8yr old boy and 18yr old girl). When it comes to the share house I‚Äôve never met the girls he lives with at all but he talked to me about them and I‚Äôm not worried about them or anything cause they know we are in a relationship. The biggest thing that I‚Äôm getting frustrated about is the fact all we do all the time is lay in his bed talk for an hour have sex then we sleep and I leave in the morning and it‚Äôs been like that forever. We have never gone out at all not even for a walk, a dinner, an activity nothing - I‚Äôve brought this up to him on 4 occasions now asking if we can do something different and go out and he says yeah we can and doesn‚Äôt actually go through with it or he says he‚Äôs so busy with work and his kids that when he has the chance to see me all he likes to do is relax and chill. He‚Äôs an extremely introvert and doesn‚Äôt like going out himself and he doesn‚Äôt have any friends so im assuming that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs content with and I don‚Äôt want to keep begging him to do things. I don‚Äôt know if he just doesn‚Äôt want to do things with me because for Christmas he went with his roommates to go get Santa photos and in a conversation he briefly mentioned he caught up with a friend ( female) for coffee when she was visiting in town and I said that made me feel shit about both occasions cause I‚Äôve never even left the house with him and his excuse what 1. He was forced to go and he didn‚Äôt plan anything and 2. She‚Äôs married and didn‚Äôt say anything else about them catching up. When I found out he went to go get pictures with them it made me upset cause I know if I had asked to go and do something like that he would call it gay or just say absolutely no. This week especially everyday I don‚Äôt text him while he‚Äôs at work cause I know he‚Äôs busy when he gets back from work he goes on a rant about his day and I talk about his day with him but he never bothers to ask about my day or how my week was and just says goodnight after we talk about it.  For Christmas I was alone and he knew I had nothing to do on that day and he didn‚Äôt invite me over once or do anything at all cause he was with his kids for half the day and Ive told him I‚Äôm not ready to meet his kids yet and he was with them only for half the day and I asked him what he did for the rest of the day and he said nothing. For Christmas I got him a present and when I came over on Boxing Day I gave it to him and he looked surprised and said to me I got ur present it‚Äôs coming in the mail and then next time I came over it was ‚Äú I had to get a refund it‚Äôs taking over 3 weeks to come ‚Äú and then it was I bought u the present but I left it at work and I know he‚Äôs didn‚Äôt get me anything. I‚Äôm not complaining about not getting a gift I‚Äôm not a materialistic girl that wants to be taken for dinner or showered in gifts and attention even if he got me socks for Christmas or just took me on a beach walk it would make me happy.

One of the nights when I came over I told him I loved him and he didn‚Äôt say anything back to me at all and said it‚Äôs different for him and it takes him a little longer to get feelings like that for someone and I bursted out in tears cause I felt so humiliated and immediately regretted saying that at all and he then said I love u too then 
but I know it‚Äôs just cause I was crying, every other instance I‚Äôve said I love you he‚Äôs said it back but I know its just to protect my feelings and he doesn‚Äôt know anything else to say - I did ask him a few months later if he was actually in love with me and he said yes but he never says it on his own accord I‚Äôm always the one that has to say it first. This is the first relationship and my first guy I‚Äôve slept with and the ik age gap is pretty big I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wasting my time here and embarrassing myself or if I‚Äôm being too needy and want a fantasy relationship that‚Äôs never gonna happen if that makes sense idk I‚Äôm really stuck ",0,1737908985.0,relationship_advice,11,0.25,False

The biggest thing I'm feeling is that it's making me nauseous and extremely jittery, like I had WAY too much coffee.

I thought it was just a feeling but I can see from my fitness watch that my heart rate is ~10 BPM higher than average from before I started taking it, even when I'm sleeping and sitting still. The ""stress"" metric (not so much emotional stress but physiological, it measures heart rate variability) is sitting in the ""high"" category for multiple hours every day, which is also new since I started taking it.

I have a hard time stepping back and having perspective on side effects, I hate that they make me feel more sick (I am 100% on board with controlling my hypertension but it doesn't feel like anything, y'know? And then it's hard to deal with a drug making me feel actually unwell). Sometimes I downplay big side effects because I want to be compliant, or overblow small ones because I feel anxious about it.

Anyways, uh, it's not good if it's messing with my metabolism and I should tell my doctor, right?",1,1737908933.0,hypertension,3,1.0,False

1iaiqkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1iaiqkk/delonghi_model_comparison/,De‚ÄôLonghi model comparison,"I currently have the Magnifica XS Espresso Machine
(ECAM22110SB). I‚Äôm very happy with it for the most part. I picked it up (refurbished) about 5 years ago and it is still making great coffee. The only issue (and maybe some would love this feature!) is that the maintenance reminder function has never worked. This isn‚Äôt really an issue for me personally as I just run the whole cycle manually every couple of weeks. 
My son is finally moving out in the next month and he‚Äôs emotionally attached to the machine üòè so I‚Äôm looking for one to gift him as a moving out present.
I‚Äôm looking at the current line up and am seeing some deals, but I am having trouble understanding what model to get. 


Based on price alone $sub 600 Canadian $, I can get both the Delonghi Magnifica Evo #ECAM290.43
And the Magnifica Start #ECAM22080B for exactly the same price. Only difference I can see is that the Start is 1450w and the Evo is 1250w.
So my questions are ‚Ä¶ 
1. which one should I buy? and why?
2. Is either actually an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù at all from my current model?
3. Am I right in thinking all models utilize the same brew group?

Thanks in advance, it‚Äôs easy to get reviews from people that own one machine, but comparative reviews are seemingly quite rare.",1,1737908566.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
