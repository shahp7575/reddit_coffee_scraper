I wish this problem was easy to fix but its not and I don't even know where to start looking to not feel this way. I want to go out more. I want to find people just like me. I know that it may not turn out perfectly but that's how I wish it could be I want to laugh again and feel like my presence adds something to peoples lives. Or maybe I'm just not interesting enough 🤷‍♂️ or not and I'm just being ""woe is me.""

I digress

I want to try and make it easier for myself and go to places I feel that I would meet like minded people. quite fun places. IDK. I've asked Chat GPT a lot on where to go it usually hits me with the Go to:

Board game café,

Quiet coffee shops,

Indie music venues, and etc.

I've tried coffee shops I frequent one when I try to do creative writing, but often I find myself going when there not a lot of people, and its not like I can read a persons mind when they look completely boring no matter how interesting they may be inside.

Man, I feel so whiny and I haven't even gone into whining.

Being lonely hurts, it hurts a lot but I'm so tired of trying of putting my effort into others. I got myself hear because I gave my time to clingy ex's that I let monopolize on my time and effort, and in the end left me feeling drained and bitter. I just wish people would come to me. I know its a fantasy but, knowing that it doesn't happen just makes me feel worthless.

Sorry for rambling. I don't post on reddit a lot and I'm just going to put this out as raw as I can.

TLDR: HEY! I'm lonely anyone got and tips or advice that helped you get out of feeling lonely and making close friends? I could use the help, hope, motivation, and/or direction to get me out of this silent hell 🙂",1,1747973585.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/230zpiIQ5O): **March 2, 2025**

So for context there is a 21 year age gap between myself and my eldest brother. This made it so me (28 F) and his oldest daughter (23 F) are very close in age and have grown up very close.

I am very much the favorite aunt and have always considered us friends not just family. She comes to me when she has a problem she didn't want to talk to her parents about. She tells me about her boyfriend and friend problems. She would call me when she was in college and needed picked up from a party or bar. And I was the first person she told when her boyfriend proposed calling me at 6 am the morning after because she was so excited to tell me.

Some context on her fiancé, they have been together for 3 years and he is one year younger than her. She just graduated college in May 2024 and he is on track to graduate in May of 2025. They have their wedding scheduled for just a week after his graduation He is studying biochemical and micro engineering and is very smart, more on the introverted side with a dry humor. 

Since she introduced him to the family we could tell they are serious and tried to be as welcoming as possible inviting him to family events and on trips, getting him birthday and Christmas presents and genuinely trying to get to know him. Whenever he is around our family he acts annoyed all the time like its painful to spend time with us, and he expects my niece to stay by his side the whole function getting annoyed if any of the little cousins ask her to play including my children (more context my niece is my children's godmother) and expects her to leave at the same time as him even if they drove separately. 

My eldest brother is constantly advocating for him saying he's just introverted and the size of our family makes him uncomfortable insisting that he's different when it's smaller groups or one on one but I haven't seen it even when it was just the two of them with myself and my husband. He talks to everyone like we are stupid and is extremely condescending.

When they got engaged things got worse. With how close we are I was expecting to be asked to be apart of the wedding party but she did not ask me. I was a little hurt but I chose to let it go because it's her special day and her choice. Then his family planned the engagement party and didn't invite any of my family. She explained that it was just a small affair (just their parents and siblings) but I later found out she lied to me when I saw pictures on social media. I did confront her about that but she said she didn't plan the guest list so I tried to let that go too. Then she didn't invite myself or my mom to her dress outing saying it was a limited number of people allowed and she wanted to make sure his mom and sisters could come with her. After that I told her that it really seemed like she was trading our family for his family. She said she wasn't but when I asked them later how they planned to spend holidays he said they'd spend them with his family.

My last straw was over December and January. In December she invited me and my husband for dinner. I was excited because she hadn't initiated us hanging out since her engagement. Dinner was nice a little awkward since conversation wasn't smooth with her fiance but pleasant enough. When the check came my husband took care of it after it sat on the table for about 15 minutes and they didn't offer to split or pay even though they invited us. Then when we were ready to go they asked if we could have a serious conversation. I was confused as to why we didn't have it during the meal but they proceeded to ask us for money to pay for their wedding. She said it was turning out to be more expensive then they thought and needed help since their parents don't make enough. I asked why they didn't wait until he was working and not just in an unpaid internship or until she got a full time job instead of a part time job. I said that I wasn't saying no but that I just wanted to understand why they wanted to have their wedding so fast (the wedding is about 8 months after their engagement). 

That conversation devolved into an argument about financial responsibility where her fiance said if we can help then we should because its family. And then following up with us having plenty of time to resave when my husband explained a lot of our money was invested for our childrens future. After we offered 2g as a little something to help, my niece brought up my savings from my deceased husband's life insurance. I asked if she really thought bringing up my deceased husband was going to help her. We then repeated our offer of 2g and he asked if that was really all we'd give them so we withdrew the offer. We left enraged.

Then before Christmas my mom invited them over to bake because the fiance enjoys baking desserts and bread. He was so rude to her throughout that she came over for some grandkid time and tea because she was so sad. My dad was pissed. And then neither my niece or fiance came to Christmas. We had a family get together around new years and when we were driving two of my brothers and their wives home we had a conversation about how sick everyone was of the fiance and how we wished they weren't getting married.

Finally in January it was my parents 50th wedding anniversary I planned a party for them and then we were going to Mexico which was group financed by myself and my siblings for our parents. Fiance was only coming to party as he couldnt miss school for mexico. The party was fancy, rsvp invitations, private venue, catered, semi-formal dress code. A week before my niece text me and let me know fiance wasn't going to come to the party because of a fraternity event. I told her that this was an important family event and on top of that it was rude to skip out on an event that you've rsvped for without a good reason and made it clear that I didn't consider his fraternity a good reason considering how long he's known about the event. She said she'd talk to him but I never heard back so I was unsure if he was going to come.

Day of he showed up late wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and backward cap. My mom still trying to be nice said she was glad he was there and he responded ""like I had a choice"". He then stayed in his seat not speaking to the people at his table or participating in the activities. About half way through we were taking a family picture and invited him to be in it and he said ""this isn't my family"". My mom started crying and excused herself to the bathroom. I pulled him aside and snapped I told him that if he didn't want to be in this family to get the f- out. That I was tired of dealing with his attitude and disrespect, and pretending to like him and told him to leave. When my niece went to follow him I told her that if she went with him that she should forget coming to Mexico with us. She didn't follow him but she made it clear that she was upset that he'd been kicked out. The adults in the family (about 12 of us) sat down with her to air out our grievances about the fiance with her so that she understood the extent of the problem, but she still defended him said that we just didn't know him as well and that we made him uncomfortable.

After that conversation I told my husband that I just couldn't act like nothing was wrong anymore. So we declined on the RSVP to the wedding. She text me asking why we said no and I met her for coffee. I explained to her that I didn't feel that I could support her marriage that he wasn't a good person and I felt like her independence and everything that was special about her was disappearing behind his expectations. She disagreed and told me that I just didn't understand. She then told me that if I really cared about her that I should suck it up and come to her wedding.

So AITAH? Should we go to the wedding? And was I wrong for telling her in the first place?

**UPDATE:** My niece was raised in a Christian household and she chose to maintain her faith while in college when she did live independently (on scholarship and student subsidized housing with one roommate away from parents for four years) and from what I understand her fiance is too. They dont live together and they dont do overnights by their choice. She has returned to living with her parents because she is broke and unmotivated and he lives in a frat house. Her parents also expect her to follow their rules including a curfew while living at home in respect for the routine that's been established for her special needs sister. So while I agree with the assessment that he's setting her up to be isolated they aren't currently in a situation or the privacy for financial or emotional abuse. I do also think he's a narcissist. She agreed to sit down and talk with me again and I was able to better articulate my concerns for her future and what she is setting herself up for, and my concerns about him.

We are still not going to the wedding. I explained to her that part of it is because I love her. That ultimately it's supposed to be a special day for her and that with the way I feel about him that I would object to the union in front of everyone as opposed to privately. I told her that whatever she chooses that I am always specifically in her corner and that I hope that she will still want to spend time with me and my kids but more than that to know that she can come to me anytime for anything. And that for her sake I do hope that I'm wrong about him. We did get her a few things off the registry that I knew were more for her than for him. She said she would think about everything so we will see what happens between now and then.

And to the person who said they thought I didn't think it through on what this might mean for the future I can assure you I did. My family means the world to me and I don't want to hurt her or my relationship with her but we got to the point where I couldn't stay quiet and pretend like there wasn't anything wrong. Thanks to everyone for the input it really helped me organize my thoughts and think through everything that's happened.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA, but i don't think you are seeing things clearly.

The guy made her own grandma cry and she defends him. You all act as if he is the problem here. But SHE is choosing him, she is defending him.

He is that way because she allows it to be. He made her grandma cry and she still said you were all in the wrong. She is not some silly child blinded by love. She sees what he does, but still chooses him when he so blantantly disrespects all of you. She is the AH here. (Well the fiancé too, ofc, but it wouldn't matter if she was not choosing him). Stop believing she is just some misguided child. She's an adult and making very clear choices.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. I like how when asking for money y’all are all family, but when it’s time to take a picture y’all aren’t family. I would let your niece know that while you don’t support her marriage you support her and will be there if she needs to leave.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. He really said ‘this isn’t my family’ at a 50th anniversary party after begging for wedding money. You dodged a bullet not funding his big day

**Commenter 4:** Nta. I love the honesty you were able to offer your niece which is all she needs right now.

I think your niece sounds a little entitled and I’m shocked she asked you for money for their wedding, it seems that’s the only reason why they asked you out to lunch.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/DEQuMXbNAe): **May 16, 2025 (2.5 months later)**

So I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to have anything else to update after my husband and I decided not to go to the wedding, and figured if I did have more to update it wouldn't be until after the wedding. But holy hell was I wrong. I figured I'd share since so many people were invested and gave great advice when I needed it before.

So first off my daughter and I ended up going to the bridal shower at the end of April. My niece asked me repeatedly to come and I figured that things would be relatively drama free since the fiancé doesn't get to come to that. I asked in advance if she was sure she wanted my daughter to come since she is under 10. I was assured that there would be other children there and that my niece really wanted her goddaughter there. 

Skip to day of and my daughter was the only child. One of my SIL even told me she was told not to bring her 3 daughters (one older and two younger than my daughter). The maternal aunt kept scolding my daughter for ""touching things"" even though I was keeping an eye on her and she did no such thing. The mother of the groom asked if I was purposely trying ruin the event and the grooms sister said it was rude of me to bring her. 

I was ready to just walk out but the bride's 19 year old sister took my daughter to play in her room upstairs. My other niece that took her upstairs has special needs and had said she was feeling overstimulated, but the bride was still upset that she didnt stay downstairs for the whole event. The bride never even said hi to my daughter making her feel very sad when we went home. 

We played those how well do you know the bride games which I won prompting my niece to say that I was ""basically her best friend"" causing an awkward silence as the room became confused as to why I wasn't in her wedding party. Extra special surprise for me when I found out that all the grooms sisters are in her bridal party but her ""best friend"" and her own sister are not 🤷‍♀️

About a week later we got together to celebrate my dad's birthday. When my mom invited them the fiancé responded ""if I don't have anything better to do then I might come."" My mom didn't hear anything else so assumed he wasn't coming and when he showed up she had to set a place for him prompting him to play victim saying we don't want him around. He then had to be asked to put his phone away at the table while we were all eating and no one else had their phones with them.

The final straw for my parents was two-fold. They asked about the rehearsal dinner because you'd think the grandparents of the bride would be invited. They were told it was wedding party only (which basically includes the grooms whole family). I later found out through other people that the grooms grandparents were going to the rehearsal dinner because they came from out of state and wanted as much time with the grandkids as they could get. I kept that tidbit to myself because I didn't want my parents to be more hurt than they were already feeling. They then had the audacity to ask my parents to hang out with the brides sister since she doesn't do well staying at home alone and they would all be busy at the dinner.

The second thing was that the bride asked my mom what she'd be wearing to the wedding specifically asking if she was going to be buying a new dress. My mom said that she wasn't buying something new because she already had a nice dress. My niece responded that my mom dresses old fashion and frumpy and that she didn't think anything she already had would be appropriate for the wedding. (My mom is very stylish for her age (mid 70s) and the dress she had picked out was gorgeous). My mom told her that she was being rude but that she would give her the benefit of the doubt because planning a wedding was stressful and sent her a picture of the dress. She then told my niece that she had gotten it for her best friend's daughters wedding and had only ever worn it that once so my niece hadn't seen it before. My niece responded ""I guess it's ok"". My mom felt very defeated and my dad had had enough. He responded on their behalf with ""from our various interactions it does not seem that you want us to be participants in your special day. Your grandmother and I will no longer be attending your wedding."" They returned their wedding gifts. My husband and I decided to do the same 🤣

Now from my side of the family the only ones that are going are two of my five siblings. One because it's his daughter, and one because his wife is playing the guitar during the ceremony and he did not want her going alone. She does piano or acoustic guitar accompaniment for special events professionally and she had committed before the bulk of the drama happened and did not want to harm her professional reputation by backing out last minute. That brother has let everyone know that they will not be staying past the ceremony, that his kids are hanging out with grammy and gramps, and that he is going full petty by wearing jeans, t-shirt, and hat just like the fiancé did to our parents 50th anniversary celebration.

That's all I've got for now and idk what else could happen at this point but I'll keep you updated. (Wedding is 1 week away!)

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Is your niece using him and his obvious disrespect for your family as her own little rebellion against a stifling home life and upbringing? I know I'd be rebelling like fuck if I was mid-20s, still living with my parents at their insistence, and they imposed a damned curfew on me. Having her fiance be the one taking the fire, and the blame, will make it so much easier for her to go low contact and live her own life without the restrictions and expectations piled on her by her birth family.

Do you know if she wanted to move in with him before the wedding but her parents had a screaming fit about it? That might be why they want to get married so quickly, just so she can get out from under her parents' roof and rules.

> **OOP:** Not their insistence. She has a part time job and can't afford to live anywhere else. The curfew is to respect the other people in the house just because you’re an adult doesn't mean you can come and go whenever you please when doing so may be disturbing other people that have set schedules and real jobs or special needs like her sister. Especially when the said individual is contributing a big fat nothing to the finances and upkeep of the home. Its less of a curfew and more of a be home by a certain time or make other arrangements sort of thing. She lived with a room mate in college because she got a big scholarship and subsidized housing. My family is religious but not pushy and very open minded. A few of us have walked away from the faith or established our own beliefs. It was their decision not to move into together before this and I'm sure a contributing factor to that was him being very happy and content in his fraternity house and her unable to afford something on her own.

She's certainly not a religiously oppressed little victim here just to be clear. I do see how in the first post I conveyed it that way but a better way to put it would be that they both grew up in a Christian upbringing and chose to make decisions based on those personal beliefs.

**Commenter 2:** So..why did you let those relatives talk to your daughter like that and behave like that instead of setting the record straight ""I quiet literally have it in writing that my daughter is wanted here, so how about oyu take it up with X if you disagree. Now get away from my daughter and leave her alone .""

> **OOP:** The only one who spoke directly to my daughter was my nieces aunt on her mother's side. I told her that if there was a problem she needs to come to me. We've both known each other for as long as I can remember and that was pretty much the end of it. I also told my daughter that she didnt do anything wrong. Everyone else was either talking to me or not so subtly talking about it behind my back. My daughter didnt hear any of that she was just bored and felt uncomfortable because there wasn't anyone other than me and the younger of the nieces for her to talk to or play with. Like I said I was ready to just leave when she was taken upstairs to play. Ultimately her afternoon was fine. She was sad because she knew the party was for ""gigi"" (as she calls her) and that she didnt even get to say hi.

**Commenter 3:** MO this is the consequence of sheltering young people and not letting them have normal romantic interactions so they can frame what is and isn’t a good relationship.

I think that because she’s barely been allowed to have these relationships before, she’s really keen to get married because it’s the only way she’ll be allowed to experience it.

> **OOP:** I totally agree in certain upbringing but I'm not totally sure it applies here. While my family is religious it's not in the controlling way. We've all been encouraged to free thinking and she's seen examples from some of us chosing to make our own way and choosing to experience love and relationships in the way we wanted too. And our family doesn't judge us for those choices. Plus she's grown up with me and I'm pretty much as vocal as it gets about the benefits of exploration and intimacy. She chose to maintain her faith while living independently during college and from what I understand so did he. She got to live independently during college thanks to scholarships. She's back at her parents house because she's broke and unmotivated and their rules are more there because they need to maintain schedule and boundaries for the sake of their younger daughter's special needs.

**OOP on her niece and the fiance's plans after graduation and wedding**

(Yes their wedding and his graduation are only 2 weeks apart 🙄) No none of us went to his graduation. So after their honeymoon he should have a big boy job 🤷‍♀️

**Additional Information from OOP after reading comments**

> **OOP:** So to address a few things I've noticed popping up:
> 
> the reason the fiancé was invited to family dinner was my mom. We (her children) have asked her to stop inviting him to things because he always inevitably ruins the atmosphere but she is a part of the generation where family always gets another chance and you do everything to keep the peace. We are slowly but surely helping her to establish and keep healthy boundaries but she was also holding onto hope that she would be gaining a grandson and not be loosing a granddaughter.
> 
> My niece is absolutely contributing to the problem. She did not use to be this way. As I've said before we were good friends, she's the godmother to my kids and was in both my weddings. I noticed her becoming more self centered as she gained independence in college. I hoped it would get better but it's gotten worse contributed to by the dipshit and his family. I'm trying to find the balance in letting her know I love her and that if she's in trouble or needs help that we are here, but that her current attitude and actions are unacceptable and unsupported.
> 
> Sometimes she does acknowledge that he's rude but also has a excuse lined up like school stress, internship work load, bad day sort of stuff. Always comes back to he's a good guy and we just don't know him well enough.
> 
> I think my brother is in denial and doesn't want to admit that his daughter is getting into a bad thing. He's full of all the excuses too i.e. introverted, not comfortable with large groups, stressed, tired, smart to the detriment of social skills we've heard it all. Kind of hard to ignore when your whole family decides not to show up to the wedding though so maybe it'll kick some sense into him. He was very angry when I sent him screen shots of the texts between his daughter and our mom though so I'll give him props for that one.

[Michigan, I need to find help for a gay teenager who does not want to go to a camp to ""cure"" him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/dShI1PYNfx)  **July 31, 2020**

Alright, I do not live in Michigan, but the family that needs help is there.

I have a cousin who is 17 years old, and his parents found out that he is gay. He found out that they are going to send him to one of these camps that swears that they could 'cure' him. He had a friend who was forced to go and the poor kid was horribly abused, and is not doing well mentally or physically.

When he found out that those people would come for him, He ran away, called me, and I called some friends that got him to another part of my family. They are going to try and keep him safe.

His 18th birthday is next week Tuesday, and we need advice on how to keep him from going. How can we protect him? I don't know much about that camp, so I do not know if they can still drag him there. Advice on how we can keep him safe is very much needed.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Bricker1492**

>At 18, he cannot be forced to go or stay at any camp.

>Are you asking for advice on how he can avoid this camp for the next five days?

**OOP**

>>Yes, basically I am. However, I heard of camps that will still take him, even if he was 18. As long as his parents signed for him to go. I do not know if this is true, so any advice would be wholeheartedly welcomed.

[AITA for not telling people my missing cousin is staying with me right away?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/29sWQxOWox)  **Dec 11, 2020 (3 months later)**

It is the middle of the night, and my phone won't stop ringing because of my family.

To try and keep this short, my cousin ""Jake"" got outed about 4 or five days before his 18th birthday in the summer. His parents, my aunt and uncle, made arrangements for him to be sent to one of those awful camps that claim they could ""cure"" him. A kid in his community was forced to go and came back and was clearly not well, so Jake didn't want to go.

Jake ran away from home, and jumped from one family house to another. His folks didn't file a missing person report because they didn't want to look bad to their neighbors. They just told them that he went to that camp willingly.

He dissapeared in the middle of october, and turned up in my city a week later. After making sure he was safe to bring home, my wife and I allowed him to stay. He didn't want me to tell the rest of the family for a while, because those people at the camp keep showing up to take him.

I made sure to talk to a lawyer, who assured Jake that they cannot take him. Three days ago, he told his parents he was here. A few hours later, those damn camp people showed up, but they were unable to take him.

My family has been blowing up my phone for the last two days angry that I didn't tell someone sooner. Well, jake didn't feel safe yet, and still doesn't. I wanted to make sure he was ready.

Still, even those that want to protect Jake is upset with me for hiding him.

AITA for not telling anyone that he is here until he was ready?

**cyfermax**

>NTA. Fuck those people. Fuck homophobes that think being gay is something that needs to be cured in the first place. Fuck people that think parents have any right to do that to their kids.

>Good on you for protecting him.

>>Not to get all political, but I’m gonna. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that “conversion therapy” is somehow protected by the First Amendment. I can’t even roll my eyes hard enough.

EDIT:  Wow, thank you all for the awards. I don't deserve them but thanks. Since I am drinking coffee and slowly going through the comments I thought I should say a few things.

First off, while I figured I wasn't the AH for hiding him from my more narrow minded family, it was those that really wanted to help jake that made me feel guilty. They were all scared out of their minds and wanted the peace to know he was ok. I felt bad for not telling them. Though i am sure they wouldn't had turned him in, I felt bad because we were working on keeping him safe.

Also,  we got a lawyer who got the police on the look out for those camp people in case they try anything. Jake is not going out alone until we are sure he is safe.

Third, we are looking on how to get his paper work, like his birth certificate, here because no way he trusts his parents to just hand them over. My granny in law is talking to some people that could help.

Fourth, Jake says hello and thank you.

Oh and we're Catholic, not Christian. We're our own special type of jacka$$es.

EDIT Once again: ok you're right about the Catholic/Christian thing. I was raised to split hairs, I apologize.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/3O4hDZX8lH)  **Dec 17, 2020 (6 days after last post)**

First off, I want to thank everyone for their comments and advice. Thank you for saying I was NTA, because I was doubting myself.

Regarding the Camp people; We have footage of them coming up to our house, and other family member's houses, looking for Jake. So we have a clear image of what they look like. I already warned those people not to come near our house or Jake. they seemed to listen, but Jake is still not going to leave the house without someone. I talked to the police about it, and they cannot do anything unless these people break the law, but they will keep an eye out. Well, better than nothing, I guess.

Regarding the Paperwork; My Aunt and Uncle refuse to hand over the papers. They want Jake to either come home or go with those people. Neither is happening. We are looking up ways to get Jake's paperwork without them, but someone suggested calling the police and explaining what happened. While I don't usually want to go that far, that is what we are probably going to have to do.

Regarding Therapy: Jake agreed to it. I am getting a referral from my own therapist, so Jake is going to get help there.

Regarding family: >Insert loud sounds of pained annoyance< Some family threaten to come over to try and make Jake go back home. Others, while understanding why I didn't tell them Jake was here, are still upset with me. It'll be a while before I can smooth things over with them.

Regarding Jake: He is safe. We have him set up comfortably here. My Granny-In-Law pretty much adopted him, and I am so sure she is going to put him in his will. He is safe, surrounded by people that support him, and I'm going to see about finding him some work when he's ready to try it.

Again, thank you everyone for your messages and Advice. we will be using them. and Jake says thank you as well.

**OOP added another update: June 8th 2021 (6 months later)**

UPDATE: I wasn't sure if people were still reading this or I could make a third post. Decided to update here just in case I can't make a third post.

Jake is doing well. While it was a struggle to get his papers from his parents, Jake threatened to tell their community and church that he ran away and they didn't file a police report. They handed the stuff over to keep him quiet.

I helped him get his license here, he is staying with my family and I for the time being. My granny in law adopted him, I think. She is quite fond of him.

He has a job, is in therapy, and we found out his ex boyfriends parents were the ones that spilled the beans about him being gay. He is an ex because he sided with his parents, so screw him.

But, despite everything he is going to be ok. We are not worried about those camp people anymore. He is safe. He is well and says hi.

I went to the NYC embassy in person from PA to see if I could get my US issued marriage certificate attested. This was requested by KFIN to get my paper shares dematerialized and the shares had my maiden name while all my KYC documents had my married name, I did send in a query re. this using the PRAMIT system in early May but never received an answer so decided to go in person.

I went on Tuesday 20-May-25. (Before going, check that the embassy is open using this [link](https://www.indiainnewyork.gov.in/pages?id=Vy80RENjZGxxTTNDOHN5VkRJSGlJUT09&subid=WEEvaENpL3VyK3BxTER3cTFYYVJqUT09)). We did not need to make an appointment.

Document dropoff is allowed between 9:30 -11:30am. We arrived there around 9:05am. The miscellaneous services entrance is downstairs on the left of the main entrance to the embassy - there is a sign outside. Though the document acceptance process opens at 9:30am, you are allowed to enter the embassy early and wait. You have to turn off your phone completely on entry and put it in a locker. There is a guard there who directs the process.

There were about 6 people waiting when we got there. There is a computer and 2 printer/copiers available for use. There are 2 waiting areas when you enter - the right has the computer and printer/copier and the left has just a copier. There is also a coffee machine and ice cream for kids . We were directed to the left section upon arrival. There were pens and glue stick available there as well. You checkin at a console with your name and service you are there for and get a number. And yes, there are restrooms there as well.

Before going, I tried to fill out the online [form ](https://www.indiainnewyork.gov.in/Miscellaneous_service)but it was not working. After selecting the category, service and mode, clicking the 'Submit' button does nothing. It is supposed to bring up an online form where you can fill in your information, pay online and print the application and receipt. The lady at the consulate acknowledged there was a technical issue on their website and the guard was handing out a paper copy of the form to fill in manually.  This was the same as the pdf at this [link](https://www.indiainnewyork.gov.in/pdf/MISCELLANEOUS_FORM_20190212_june_11.pdf).

At promptly 9:30am, there were 2 counters that were staffed - one for the left area and one for the right. Each person is called by number/name via an announcement and tv screen notification. We were seen around 9:45am. The documents needed were the application (with a passport photo glued to it), document to be attested (no notarization needed in my case but I am not sure if that is true for all documents), copy of my US passport, copy of my OCI, copy of first and last page of my old Indian passport, copy of diriving license as address proof. We brought originals in case they were needed for verification but she did not ask for them.

In my case, they said they did not attest the US marriage certificate (which is also what their website said but I wanted to confirm in person). Instead they offered to issue a marriage certificate on embassy letterhead based on my spouse's information in my last Indian passport with no marriage date for $27 or to stamp the original apostilled marriage certificate (which I had with me) for $12 or both. They did suggest I could do a self declaration that I was the same person with my maiden and married name and they would stamp that but I did not want that as my name change was due to marriage and KFIN had explicitly asked for a marriage certificate. I did both the embassy issued marriage certificate and the stamp on the apostilled marriage certificate to be cautious and avoid another 2+hr trip to the embassy from PA. Fingers crossed that KFIN will accept these.

They accept payment in cash, debit card, credit card but no personal checks. This is where the website is confusing - the [FAQ ](https://www.indiainnewyork.gov.in/pages?id=WEEvaENpL3VyK3BxTER3cTFYYVJqUT09&subid=V2QwdlRTcnZncU1qVi9qNTBReXFCQT09&nextid=REtSbm05ZEl6ejZJaGpxKzVZbWZJQT09)say they accept Cash, Credit/Debit card/Bank Transfer but the online form (when it was working last week) said only cashier check/money orders are accepted. I did take a money order for $27 and they accepted it and I paid the balance via credit card. I got a receipt for each document to be used for pickup.

Note that the waiting area is closed at 11:30am and you cannot wait there till the documents are ready for pickup in the afternoon.

They asked us to come back at 4pm for pickup. They asked some other folks to come back at 12:30pm for pickup but not us. The guard thought they would have made an exception for us as we travelled from PA and let us pick up at 12:30 but we were fine picking up at 4pm as we were planning to spend the day with family that lived in NYC.

We came back at 4pm. Pickup is till 4:30pm. The same guard let us in. We were asked to turn off our phones but not to put in locker. One of the staff came out and started reading out names. I turned in the receipt and got my documents. The process took less than 5 mins. If you lose your receipt, you can use your ID as proof to pick up the documents as long as you are the applicant.

1kta9hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/summariseme/comments/1kta9hh/20250522_food_futures_buzz_bites_and/,"(2025-05-22) Food Futures Buzz, Bites, and Breakthroughs May 22","## Food News Roundup: Mango Mania, Blood Sugar Insights, and Stock Market Fluctuations (May 22, 2025)

The food sector saw a dynamic day on May 22, 2025, marked by both culinary highlights and market movements. From the seasonal celebration of mangoes to insights into the health effects of popular snacks and fluctuating share prices of major food companies, the day offered a diverse snapshot of the industry.

**Mango Season in the Spotlight: A Culinary Celebration**

The arrival of mango season brought with it a wave of recipes and nostalgia. News summaries highlighted the versatility of the ""King of Fruits,"" emphasizing its potential beyond simply being sliced and eaten. Mangoes, celebrated for their versatility, can be enjoyed sliced, juiced, or even frozen. The summaries emphasized the fruit's deep-rooted association with Indian culture, connecting its consumption with cherished memories of hot summer afternoons. Consumers were encouraged to explore various mango-based recipes beyond the classic fruit-eating experience, suggesting the creation of chutneys, salads, puddings, and smoothies.

One specific recipe highlighted was ""Aam Panna,"" a refreshing drink made from raw mangoes. A nutritionist, Avni Kaul, founder of Nutriactivania, endorsed this beverage, pointing out that raw mango aids digestion and mint offers a calming effect. She recommended substituting sugar with jaggery for a healthier option.

**Health-Conscious Consumption: Exploring the Impact of Snacks**

Beyond the summery indulgence of mangoes, news summaries also provided insights into the health implications of common snacks. The focus was on roasted masala papads, a popular appetizer, and their effect on blood sugar levels. Metabolic health coach Karan Sarin conducted a test using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to assess the impact of eating ural dal roasted papads, paired with vegetables like onion, tomato, coriander, and chilies. The results indicated no significant blood sugar spike two hours after consumption, leading Sarin to conclude that this particular papad is relatively low in carbs, provided it is not overeaten. This segment underscores the growing consumer interest in understanding the nutritional effects of food choices.

**Stock Market Dynamics: Tracking Performance in the Food Sector**

A significant portion of the news summaries was devoted to the financial performance of major food processing and packaging companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The focus was primarily on Nestle India, Britannia Industries, and Tata Consumer Products, with multiple updates throughout the day reflecting price fluctuations and market activity.

*   **Nestle India:** Nestle India’s share price saw continuous adjustments throughout the day, opening at ₹2353.1, fluctuating between a low of ₹2340.8 and a high of ₹2391.75. The closing price was recorded at ₹2361.85. In terms of performance, the stock showed a slight decline of -1.26% in one day, -1.86% over the past month, and a positive return of 6.38% over the last three months. The daily pivot level for the stock was set at ₹2360.82, with slight variations in later reports.

*   **Britannia Industries:** Britannia Industries, operating in the same sector as Nestle, also exhibited market activity, ending the day at ₹5445. The share experienced fluctuations throughout the day, with a low of ₹5416.55 and a high of ₹5491.9. The share closed with a -0.85% one-day return, a 0.21% return over the past month and 13.41% in the last three months. The daily pivot level was set at ₹5451.15.

*   **Tata Consumer Products:** Focusing on the tea and coffee sector, Tata Consumer Products’ share price stood at ₹1126.8, undergoing some volatility. The stock saw a low of ₹1116.9 and a high of ₹1137.2, with a negative one-day return of -0.99% and a slightly negative return of -0.82% over the past month, but had a positive return of 12.43% in the last three months. The daily pivot level for this stock was set at ₹1126.97, then later reports showed it at ₹1126.97.

The constant repetition of the stock price information indicates the fast-paced nature of the financial markets and how frequently investors monitor these metrics. These summaries highlight the fluctuating nature of the market and offer insights into the performance of three Largecap companies within the food processing and packaging industry.

**Additional Culinary Resource: Digital Cookbook for Inspiration**

In other news, a new season of the ""Comfort Eating"" podcast was announced, featuring Grace Dent and celebrity guests. Accompanying this was the promotion of The Guardian's Feast app, a digital cookbook with over 5,000 recipes. The app features convenient functions like cook mode, ingredient searches, and a save-for-later option. This highlights the increasing reliance on digital tools for culinary inspiration and convenience in the modern era.

**In Conclusion**

The food news from May 22, 2025, presented a mix of culinary and financial aspects. Mangoes took center stage, offering a seasonal delight and a focus on diverse recipe possibilities. Health-conscious consumers found information regarding the impact of popular snacks like masala papads on blood sugar levels. Simultaneously, the stock market reports provided a detailed snapshot of the fluctuating performance of major food industry players like Nestle India, Britannia Industries, and Tata Consumer Products. This news cycle showcased the interconnectedness of food, health, and financial markets, offering a broad overview of the dynamics within the food industry.

I’m a manager, and one of my team members is being laid off due to company-wide cuts — it’s not performance-based, and it’s heartbreaking. She is a single mom with a lot on her plate, and I want to do something kind and supportive without it feeling patronizing or “too much.”

I’m thinking about putting together a small self-care gift (face masks, lip balm, lotion) plus coffee gift cards, target gift cards and a handwritten letter offering help with her job search — including a reference letter, a Link to her professional headshot I took of her for LinkedIn, and paying for LinkedIn Premium to help her move forward. I’d like to pack this up for her to discover after she leaves, so it’s a “take your time” kind of support.

I’m worried this could come across as tone-deaf or awkward, and I want to make sure it’s genuinely helpful and respectful of her pride. She and I have a good relationship and have been through a lot together in the past 2 years but because I'm her boss I feel like she might be angry with me or think that I didn't fight for her.

1kta2wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1kta2wn/im_scared_of_confessing_to_someone_and_ruining/,I’m scared of confessing to someone and ruining the friendship,"I (21M) was in a 5 year long relationship and I got broken up with 6 months ago. I’ve also had a long history of being abandoned by people close to me in my life including family and friends. I know that I have bad abandonment issues and trust issues.

I’ve been talking to this girl (21F) for the past 5 months on and off. We texted for a month and then went on dates a month. When I tried to DTF she told me that she wasn’t ready for a relationship in general, that I was a really good guy, and that this was a little too soon for her.

We continued talking and about a month later we decided to be just friends.

Now 3 months in deep we still hang out, study together, get coffee, and sometimes get dinner together just as friends. This continues for two months and I really just enjoy her company and getting to know her better. I’m someone who has alot of platonic female friends and for this period of time, I genuinely just viewed her as a friend and someone who I felt super happy and comfortable to be around.

2 weeks ago, something kind of switched? She was having a bad day and I stayed up for a few hours just calling her and comforting her. She talked, we laughed, and overall she felt much better afterwards. We started hanging out much more often and this all builds up to last weekend.

Last weekend I invited her on Friday to go to a bar and hang out. We meet up at 11ish and end up going back to hers and just talking until 4AM. We both just completely lose track of time and are just enjoying each others company. We aren’t saying anything flirty or touchy but there’s a strong connection there. After that night over text we start openly calling each other cute, we’ve both mentioned how we just lose track of time around each other, how we really enjoy hanging out with each other, and how we make each other feel calm. She’s an extreme anxious person and she tells me that when she’s around me, she feels herself and she feels calm. I’m someone who’s not anxious but I’m always thinking ahead and stressed about something, I’ve told her back that I feel really calm when I’m around her too.

We both live in the same direction from school and as we are leaving for summer break she asks me if I want to drive down with her. So I cancel my flight and we begin our 6 hour drive. Once again, we aren’t romantic or flirty. But time just flew. We were joking, laughing, and just enjoying each others company. I opened up about things I’ve never said before and so did she.

She dropped me off and drove another hour back home. We both go back to school in a week for summer internship/research and we’ve been texting each other a lot more cutesy and often than we did before.

We’ve already discussed making time for each other to hang out. It seems so obvious that she’s into me and that I’m really into her, but the more obvious it is the more I fear that I’m seeing this wrong. I worry if she actually just sees this as friendly and I ruin another friendship by confessing to someone who feels it came out of left field. I also worry that even if she does like me back a lot more this time if she isn’t ready for a relationship still.

My plan at this point is to talk to her once we go back and tell her how I feel and ask her how she feels. How should I navigate this or get a more firm grip if I’m wrong or right prior to next week?",2,1747971857.0,rant,2,1.0,False

The file was password-protected, and of course, I had no memory of ever setting a password for it. With frustration mounting, I decided to search for a tool that could unlock it.

I expected to be met with the usual clunky software: trials, watermarks, shady installs, or sketchy-looking pop-ups. But I stumbled across[ UnlockAnyPDF.com](https://unlockanypdf.com), and it completely flipped my expectations.

# A Simple Interface That Doesn’t Lie

No fluff, no fake promises—just a clean screen asking me to upload my file. I figured I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a shot. Within ten seconds of hitting “Unlock,” the site gave me an open, ready-to-use version of my invoice. No signup. No watermark. No nonsense.

# What Really Blew Me Away

Here’s what stood out:

* **Speed**: My file was unlocked before I even had time to take a sip of coffee.
* **Security**: The website assured me that files are never stored. As someone who deals with sensitive documents, this matters a lot.
* **Accuracy**: Not a single formatting issue. Fonts, tables, and graphics all looked perfect.

I’ve since used their[ PDF password removal tool](https://unlockanypdf.com/unlock-pdf/remove-pdf-password/) on multiple archived contracts and resumes I’d forgotten I’d locked years ago.

# It’s One of Those Hidden Gems

You know those rare tools that actually work better than advertised? [UnlockAnyPDF.com](http://UnlockAnyPDF.com) is one of them. It doesn’t try to upsell you at every turn, and it quietly solves a really annoying problem.

Now I’ve got it bookmarked—and I recommend it to friends, coworkers, and anyone who handles locked files.

It’s obviously because it’s full circle which is what makes it so fucking awesome, Al taking all his collected wisdom of the past four plus decades of creating music and turning his attention to his original dance-y tracks with a tighter, more precise level of focus, grit and noise. Like, We Believe’s bass is nuts (wink) and it’s rattling my house right now. And I am hard. 

It’s just so wild to hear Ministry like this, after the past 30 (killer) years of industrial metal heaviness, like, who the fuck knew the motherfucker could just suddenly turn on a dime and make this? It’s so bold and fresh. 

I couldn’t resist and took a road trip out to Philadelphia to see this all live last week, and both Thrill Kill and Ministry did not disappoint, going together like wine and cheese. (Or swine and roses?) Thrill Kill reminded me that there’s still nothing cooler than a tiny chick on stage with a huge bass strapped to her shoulder, swaying to the tunes. Kooler than Jesus. 

And I couldn’t believe how great Al sounded.

It ia assumed that a hypnotherapy session is supposed to 'feel' a certain way in order to be work.....as if there is a correct way to experience it.   
  
But let me ask you this, is there a correct way to experience 'talking to a person' or 'having a coffee'? There is no correct way and each experience differs based on so many factors. The coffee will still energize you and you will still catch up with your friends.

Each hypnotherapy is not supposed to feel the same way and nor is how deep one feels when in a trance. Just because a hypnotherapy session feels 'differet' from last time doesnt mean it wont be effective.

As always these sessions are something to be 'experienced' rather than critically analysed or comnpulsively worry about as if its some kind of a case study. All one has to do is to work with the hypnotherapist and keep moving forward.

It took me years to understand that the world doesn’t whisper...
it speaks. Clearly. Constantly.
I was just moving too fast to hear it.

Most of my life, I thought clarity was something you earned by grinding your gears harder.
Think more. Push more. Fix it. Figure it out. Hustle your way to peace.
But that never worked.
All it did was keep me spinning.

Stillness… that was the shift I never saw coming.
Not dramatic stillness. Not the performative kind you post with a candle and a quote.
I mean the uncomfortable kind.
The kind where you sit with yourself long enough to realize how loud your life actually is.
How much of it wasn’t really yours to begin with.

Once I slowed down, I started noticing things:

How shadows stretch long before the light disappears.
How people will tell you who they are if you’re quiet enough to let them..

How much we chase answers because we’re afraid of what they’ll cost.
How silence, when you finally stop fearing it, tells you everything you didn’t know you needed to hear.

I noticed how many decisions I made out of momentum,.. not meaning.
How many people I kept in my life because I was afraid of what it would mean to let them go.
How many versions of me I had built for other people, just so they'd stay.

I didn't become wiser.
Just quieter.
More observant.
Less interested in proving anything.

And strangely enough, that’s when life started speaking back,
not in epiphanies or revelations,
but in subtleties..

A deep breath that didn’t feel tight.
The first sip of coffee that didn’t come with dread.
A sunrise I didn’t scroll past.
A conversation where I didn’t flinch at the silence.

It’s not that everything’s fixed.
It’s just that I’m finally hearing myself think
and for once, I’m not trying to talk over it...

Hope this helps someone..

1kt9kea,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kt9kea,Questions on soil & area for 3 blueberry plants,"I have 3 blueberry plants that came with instructions on how to take care of them and have some questions before I plant.  The soil instructions that came with the plants seem to contradict what everyone else seems to be posting.  From the instructions, I'm supposed to use 50/50 Peat Moss & concrete sand and nothing else, or I'll ""ruin"" the plant, however others recommend using other mixtures.  



1. My plan is to follow [most of this video's info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWioPb9ovpo) plus adding sand to make 50% Peat Moss, 25% mini pine bark nuggets, and 25% sand (I bought black kow compost, but it's manure compost so I'm not sure if I should use it).  Is this mixture okay to use, or should I ignore using sand and use the compost?



2. Is the sand I have in the photos good for drainage?  I have half a garbage bin of leftover sand from pavers.  Not sure the type, but I think it's mason sand



3. I marked off a 4ft by 12ft area to dig up about the height of the pots, with the plants spaced 3 feet apart.  Is this a good area or should it be bigger/smaller/deeper?

I’m sick and tired, let me just say—
Of sitting in traffic at the buttcrack each day.
If I’m not early, I’m out of luck,
It’s the overflow lot… and the shuttle that sucks.

They said “collaborate! Culture will thrive!”
But half of our jobs didn’t make it alive.
They shipped them offshore—“it’s cost optimized!”
Now we Zoom with Mumbai while morale flatlines.

I get home from work and collapse in my dress,
No laundry, no dinner, just burnout and stress.
I’m tired, I’m bitter, unraveling fast—
And no one can say I’ve not busted my ass. 

They said we’d “connect,” that the vibe would be great,
Now I’m flanked by loud talkers I deeply hate.
There’s curry and keyboard clicks filling the air—
And EAP asked me, “Have you tried self-care?”

I slip on my headphones and pray for some peace,
Though the pressure they bring makes the aching increase.
I try to stay focused, but it’s all in vain,
Because Karen keeps pinging me. Again. And again.

I want my own space, not your loud open floor,
No puzzles, no pizza—I’ve been here before.
This office is draining and painfully bright,
I just want my kitties and peace every night.

So no, I’m not friendly—I’m tired and mad,
Of this open floor hell and your “collab” launchpad.
Remote was my refuge, my silence, my right—
Now I wander for seating,
Losing. The. Fight.

I paint on my face, pull clothes from the floor,
Commute just to hustle for space by the door.
The café is packed, the prices obscene,
The coffee is free but tastes like defeat.
The remodel is loud, glass walls and bright light—
And no one—not one of us—wants this RTO life.

Lloyd pulled his hood over his head, hoping no one would recognize him as the bracer killer Langport thought he was. He had switched into a white cloak and had a fake beard on, so he was pretty sure he was safe. You can never be too careful, though. He walked slowly to the train station.

Despite the fact that he was careful not to draw attention to himself, he had a bad feeling. That bad feeling was amplified when he found a chest on the side of the road. Chests only ever showed up if there was trouble nearby... But he couldn't turn down the good fortune. He opened the chest to find a Tear arts driver and a HP 1 quartz, which he quickly slotted into his nearly bare ARCUSXIPHAORBMENT. Danger was close, but like a leopard hunting a lion, he would be fine as long as he was strong.

About halfway to the train station, Lloyd’s daydreams about Van were interrupted by shouting. “You immigrant scum!” a young man with a gun pointed at a woman shouted. “Calvard should kill all the immigrants!” 

Lloyd believed this was a member of the anti immigration faction in Calvard. They were maybe a little violent, but he sympathized. As a cop in Crossbell, he had to deal with many violent immigrants. The man was probably in the right, and Lloyd had to stay in hiding. Not to mention anything the man did was probably just because of the greater Twilight. He continued on, and used his well trained cop selective hearing to not hear the gunshots behind him.

After the commotion, Lloyd made it to the train station without issue. He carefully flashed his ticket and entered the train while hiding within the crowd of passengers. If anyone was following him, they'd have a hard time knowing where he went. On top of that, he paid top dollar for a train ticket with a private cabin, so he wouldn't be seen just by walking through the train. He was definitely safe.

Sitting down in his cabin, he sipped on his coffee and cast out his fishing line. Hopefully he could catch some dinner while riding, and fishing always helped him think.  Lloyd was proud that he completely cracked the case during the raid, but now he needed to crack an even bigger case. Right now, he needed to think hard and long on how to stop Rean-Ishmelga and his Greater Twilight. Lloyd stared at his line, let his mind drift, and entered his mind palace.

Only moments into thinking, he was forced back into reality by a gunshot. “Where is the man calling himself Anakin Georgewalker?!” Lloyd was not happy to hear that. He immediately tried to figure out what was going on using his superior intellect. These people must be working with Ishmelga-Rean to capture him. He had to stop them.

He burst out his private cabins door. “I'm right here!” He shouted, pulling out his tonfas and activating SHARDS. “But the names not Anakin Georgewalker. It's Lloyd Bannings!” He then rushed forward, unleashing his new craft, ‘Government Approved Chokehold’. He tackled the nearest assailant and pinned him to the ground with his knee. Now the enemy had ten turns to escape, or he'd suffocate.

“You're making a mistake!” One of the enemies said, and she pulled out a spear. The woman then attempted to stab Lloyd, but missed because her robes were too big. The robes posed another problem too - Lloyd recognized them. This woman was a member of the DG Cult! The man Lloyd was pinning also wore the robes, and during his turn he failed to escape.

“DG cult, eh? It's all coming together now.” Ten turns had passed, and Lloyd had managed to dodge all of the woman's spear attacks. “ARCUS - Activate! Earth Bullet!” Lloyd summoned forth the might of his ARCUSXIPHAORBMENT, and he felt the familiar pulse of orbal energy flowing out of his ARCUSXIPHAORBMENT into the air. He willed it into the shape of a chunk of earth, and flung it forward. Lloyd was extremely proficient with arts because of his powerful mind, and he accidently flung the rock forward so hard it crushed the skull of the spear woman.

As his SHARDS retracted, he took time to search the two cult members belongings. He took the man's gun, the woman's journal, 11 water sepith, 12 time sepith, and 33 sepith mass. He then looked around the train, and when he confirmed there were no NPCs (non police civilians) around, he proceeded forward. His plan was simple: reach the engine, take the train off the tracks, and head straight to Crossbell. He wasn't safe here in Calvard, he needed his team.

As he entered the next cart, he was shocked: five DG cult members waited for him! They deployed SHARDS, and charged forward. It was a five versus one ambush!

This isn't good! He thought as one with a longsword slashed at him. He had to parry with his tonfas, and used the momentum he gained from that movement to jump over the attack of a cult member’s whip. Lloyd then landed and fell to his knees, barely dodging a lethal swing of a battle-axe. “We've got him now!”

Normally, being on your knees in combat would be a problem, but Lloyd was experienced in his knees. When a woman with a handheld cannon aimed at him and fired, Lloyd prepared to take her load. “ARCUS, activate!” He said, casting a powerful Earth Guard art that shielded all of the cannons damage. The axe fighter then acted again, using a craft to try and slice off Lloyd's feet. Lloyd quickly extended his legs, leaping into the air, and shot down with his tonfas. The axe fighters corpse resembled Swiss cheese when Lloyd landed. “One down, four to go-!”

Suddenly, the world went red. The final cult member was an extremely proficient sniper, and she had shot Lloyd in his shoulder. Then, the longsword wielding cultist moved forward with unpredictable haste - and Lloyd realized someone must have cast Chrono Burst, an art that speeds up your allies! He had no time to react as the longsword slashed his abdomen, tearing his white coat he was using as a disguise and slicing his flesh. I don't think I can win this... Unless...

“S-BURST!” Lloyd released his ultimate technique, and dealt massive damage to all of his enemies by shooting them with a massive blow from his tonfas guns. As the dust settled, Lloyd realized he was truly outmatched. All five of his opponents were standing and fully healed - the sniper has cast Celestial. Lloyd had to get out, NOW.

“Well... It seems the cult is stronger than I remembered. Toodaloo!” Lloyd then jumped out the speeding train, losing consciousness as he slammed into the ground. The last thing he saw was the train zooming away, and the fear and doubt he felt filled his unconscious mind as he closed his eyes.

1kt9k1h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kt9k1h,There is one ready to be released back into the wild,"STORY TIME! 

(And you need to stay with me, there's lots of words so you don't get a tl;dr)

Mid April 2023: I get a message that somebody has a parts car for sale and if I was interested. In my line of work I get those messages from time to time. So I do the right thing and say send me some pics and I'll let you know what I can do..... because it needed a little bit more work than he could do, foreshadowing......

Late April 2023: I killed a Deer in the GTS ....... again. Yes this makes 2 times, don't ask. 

So........I lock in to go get the ""parts car"" for my GTS.

Once I get there and load it up I realized that I agree with the prior owner, the car's in too good of shape to just part out. But it has been sitting for 13 years ... So I begin the process.

Normally with a rescue there is a basic methodology to follow. I pick it up, see if I can get it to run, then do all the maintenance, throw new parts at it if they're missing or need replaced, get it cleaned up, put a couple hundred miles on it, and then get it into the hands of someone who will enjoy the car. That normally takes about a year. And I have been consistently rescuing about one a year for the past 10 years.

 Since this car was missing the automatic transmission there was no way to crank it over, so I had to move forward with an assumption that the engine was good, so this was an engine out situation..... and I did the full work up. Remove and install or remove and replace valve cover gaskets with OEM Mazda, cam seals, water pump, timing belt, timing belt tensioner, Mazda oil cooler seal, intake gaskets, throttle body gasket, thermostat, t-stat o-ring, two new accessory Drive belts , new idler pulley bearings on both belt tensioners, and fresh radiator fluid, Mobil 1 synthetic oil with the larger ZR1 oil filter. New spark plugs, distributor cap, and rotor along with PRD plug wires and a new 53R battery. Because I had it sitting on the shelf it got powdercoated valve covers and a bright silver painted intake along with generic Chrome 3-in cold air intake piping. It's got a sprung Daiken Puck clutch and a resurfaced flywheel with the very awesome 626 transmission (see prior post about gas mileage and low RPMs on the highway). Shift linkage and pedals came from a parts car to swap it from automatic to manual. I put  Exile AutoWorx shift linkage bushings in all of my rescues so it's got both sets installed. Struts were shot so I put a brand new set of rev9 coilovers, valved adjustable and height adjustable of course, and I'm pretty happy with the current stance on the car.  Stainless steel headers, and in-house resonated test pipe, new 2.5"" catback exhaust into the Dual Chrome Mufflers with quad tips made available by deleting these spare tire well and replacing it with an ethically sourced road sign with 3-in aluminum cross bracing for support in the trunk.

18x8 et30mm KMC Wheels and new 245/40/18 tires, new inner and outer tie rod ends as well as rear brake pads and one rear caliper. All new brake fluid of course, Exterior got the brand new Draco Verde paint, refinished the window seals with a textured black rubberized coating, Mach 1 lip, functional Sleepy Eye headlights, H4 ballast headlights, LED strips in the Euro clear Corner markers. Evan Owen  also provided 3D printed fog light brackets, and the functional Sleepy Eye is definitely in play.

Window tint was done at a local shop in town, also replaced one power window regulator and rebuilt all four window guides. The interior was completely gutted and swapped for reconditioned interior panels using SEM black products: so Dash swap, all the seat belts, a pillars, b pillars, c pillars, door panels, rear panels, trunk panels, trunk carpet, Main carpet, Center console, driver and passenger floorboard kick panels, under steering wheel valance, and headliner. Driver and passenger floorboards have New Old Stock Gray floor mats, I have not driven the car with the driver side floor mat in place. Note the driver side does have the floor mat hook. Seats were swapped out to tan leather. Rear seats are in very good condition, passenger seat is in good condition, driver seat is in okay condition. If somebody with Talent would take the time, the seats can be done right.

When I was doing the interior swap I also replaced the HVAC control knobs with Billet aluminum units for a Mustang with green illumination, and I installed a dual USB power outlet with voltage display in the pocket under the control buttons. The 93 specific headlight override switch is installed and lit but is not functional, so that means you have all five buttons instead of four and the blank. Audiophiles, I replaced both front speakers with new Rockford Fozgate 5.25"" as well as some Alpine component tweeters with their own dedicated crossover. New rear 5x7 (or 6x9, i can't remember) speakers were installed and I also replaced the 6-in subwoofer in the factory sub enclosure. Power antenna Mast was broken so that has been replaced and is functional. 

As I threatened in a prior post I did remove the Alpine mini disc player, but the factory wiring is still intact and unmolested so a $15 Scoche 90s Ford adapter kit is all you need to install a ""hopefully the period correct"" aftermarket deck of your choice, and if it's not /////Alpine (or that Pioneer deck with the dolphin).... you're doing it wrong. I hit up Scott for Led lights for the interior, so all of them have been redone, the gauge cluster as well as the center console and both driver and passenger window controls have all been relamped with LED. Sun visors have been replaced with new black rebuilt units from a local upholstery shop and they feel as expensive as what I paid to have them done. Purchaser of the car has the option to select gray or tan if they prefer, I've got all three colors available.

The car also has a MAF swap and an OBD2 reader so you can pull codes on the car as long as you have something that will link to a Veepeak. On the highway the car gets close to 30 miles to the gallon. It's 30 years old and gets 30 Mi to the gallon as long as you behave. Cruise control works, AC works, tilt, sunroof, rear wiper......... 

Oh. It got a new windshield installed a month ago. And 3 new windshield wipers. And 3D printed cowl screw cap/covers from Isaac Rodriguez 

There's a possibility, I'm not sure, but I may have went a little overboard. And I've spent 20 minutes typing this out, but I feel like there's things that I'm forgetting.

This one really got the full, full treatment versus just get it back on the road running, clean it up, and send it on its way.

So, or rather BUT, here are things that I would change on the car if I were to keep the car, and/or things that I would still want to do to the car if I kept it long-term. It needs a defroster Dash vent. Luckily Evan Owen has finally doubled down and is producing them. It's got one but it's been covered with gray contact paper to keep it together because it's so brittle and falling apart like all of them, including the one in my GTS. Secondly, I'm personally not happy happy with the clutch in it. It's just a preference, but I have a full face organic stage 3 ClutchMasters with a lightened flywheel in my GTS, and it's just so nice. It was $600, but it's just so nice. The green car has a $150 Daiken generic clutch..... and the engagement isn't buttery smooth like my GTS, so my brain is going to compare it when I drive between the two of them. So driving the green car I tend to be a little bit more rev happy to keep it from chattering like a puck clutch does. I also am not happy with the seat repair to the driver seat upper bolster. I went all up and down the aisle in Hobby Lobby trying to find a thread color match and could not. I don't know what they were using when they assembled the seats in 1997 but they don't make that thread anymore apparently so the yellow/gold one that I got is just not a match, again, aesthetic preferences, but also and more importantly.... full transparency. 

The car just rolled 120,000 miles, yes, the car got 9,000 miles put on it ........... which was a touch more than me couple hundred miles from one of my rescues normally gets under my insurance. This is because my son-in-law who was two years ago a fledgling ASE mechanic needed to borrow a car that was safe to drive long distance, and I assured him that this 30-year-old vehicle that I had just rescued after sitting for 13 years was more than capable to make cross-country trips.

No sarcasm, I assure you. 

 So while he had it for about 9 months he use it as his daily driver commuter, and drove back and forth to Atlanta and to New York State multiple times to ASE certification training seminars with no issues whatsoever. The only challenge I had was getting him to pay his toll fees since the car was licensed to me and all of the bills came directly to my address..... the little @ss.

That being said, the car is great. It was at All Ford Nationals 2024 and turned heads prior to me redoing the interior completely. It is a conversation starter at every gas station, every drive-thru, and every Cars and Coffee that I have taken it to locally. It is truly a time machine that resonates with not only Gen X but everyone at these events. 

The car is officially really REALLY for sale, I just took a little longer, 2 years later longer.

I've been in contact and talks with multiple people over the past year, and I've had the time to really think about what I believe the car is worth. So this post is obligatory not only to officially put the car on the market, but also to commit to digital record how much effort went into the car to get it to where it's at.

 It lives under a car cover currently, and financially represents either a new roof for the garage, new insulation for the house, ........or, [perish the thought], a more ""responsible"" daily driver four-door replacement for my Jaguar that has a hitch..... a Tow Pig. 

Clear VA title in my name. Delivery is available, Cash only. Car is in central Virginia, zip code 24554

If you need a photo of just about any part of the car, I have it. If you'd like to have photo of anything that I've said was done to it above, I probably have it, I have documented a lot of the rebuild process on my Instagram account.

(LONG) 

1. In 2024, he graduted college from america and went back to korea for almost a year. that was honestly the worst time for me because:

A) he would ALWAYS listened to his parents no matter what to avoid conflict ex. his mom wants to get coffee but he doesnt but she would keep telling him to go with her and he eventually does even though he promised to call me during that time period. 

B) Going off of that, he would promise to call me at certain times (because of the time zones) but usally end up being flaky and go to last minute plans and that would force me to move my schedule around to stay up very late or wake up super early, even if that meant I would get the less sleep, which is so bad for my health care job. 

C) he would constantly complain about his dad saying how much he hates him and doesnt want to be with him but never grew a backbone to say no to his family. 

D) i would tell him to honestly man up and grow a pair because his brother also just does whatever he wants but hes always like ""i cant"" ""they paid for me to go to college so i have to do what they say"" even though he never wanted to go to college and was just forced to. 

E) I am indian so when his dad found out, he did not like that, ever since year 1 of dating his dad and mom would push him to dad other girls esp other east asian girls and never acknowkledge me as person even when i try to say hello over their facetime calls. 

Bonus: he would have horrible drinking issues to the point where he would fall over on the sidewalk when he calls me drunk; never wake up on time when ive been the one clearing out my day for him and always getting into fights with me about how controlling i am. 

  
This year: 

  
He came back for grad school and i moved in with him (now left to live in a different state) because i also got a job in the same state. he ended up getting a internship with this small korean company and wow every habit came back.

A) his boss loves loves lovessss to drink and forces him to drink and stay out late on weekdays which always worried me because he is not a good drunk, he cares a lot about his career and him being hungover doesnt help and i always have to take care of him.

B) going off of that, i went to a concert in brooklyn and i was new to the area and he said he could go to brooklyn and help pick up my friend and i after the concert. he had a dinner/drinking session and after the concert i kept calling him because i just didnt know where he was in brooklyn until i saw he was still at home in jersey.. that really hurt me because i was relying on him for this important concert and told him weeks ahead and he answered the call half alseep. i never cry in front of my friends but oh boy i cried so much which sucked because we had amazing time. of course another fight. i told him to stop drinking or im leaving him. he stopped drinking. 

  
This past week: 

  
His family is visiting him for the week and i prepared for it and i was fine because my bf and i talked it out. he said he was only going to see them saturday and not sunday because he wanted to talk to me and study for his cpa exam. i was like okay thats cool hes keeping his word now. 

A) saturday was honestly fine with his family and i was slowly easing up on his flakiness because i believed what he said and i cleard out my sunday for him to talk before the weekday started up. he called me that night and i was truly excited to hear about his day with his family but then he told me that hes going out tomorrow (sunday) for just a bit and get dinner, i was pretty upset but then he told me he was going to call me sunday morning. i woke up at 10am, looked at my phone and he called but then said hes heading out to the city to see his family. i had so much anger that day. he wasnt even gone for a half day too like he said, he was gone a full day. i told him if you respect me you will gp back home and do what you told me yesterday and he kept saying he cant because his family want him to help them around. but he never helps me around like how he helps his family??? then idk where my mental went wrong but i started calling him like crazy and i promise to god i have never felt so crazy like that. the spam messages i was sending, the calls and him saying its not a big deal. 

then he goes to dinner- he went to the one steakhouse i kept telling him ive been wanting to take him to ever since i saw it. he always pays for my things and i was saving up to take him to nice fancy steakhouse. his dad took him instead and his dad has been doing that so often thta it feels like theres no reason to plan speical event anymore for my boyfriend. i cried all day, i was just over it and my bf kept telling me that its no big deal, it doesnt even taste that good etc etc but i wanted to experience that with him!! he didnt undestand that until our fight over on facetime. 

sorry this is long but its almost over. thank you if you stuck around this far. 

B) yesterday he told me after work his dad kept telling him he wanted to go to dinner with him and i was like okay thats fine but then he tells me oh he wants to see my thursday too. kept saying he didnt want to see his family but still ended up going.

C) today, he went to his dinner after work and i told him dont call me after work because i was tired from my day and wanted to nap and he said hell call me after he gets home. he knows ive been wanting to sleep earlier so i can spend time with my dog so i was happy he was respecting my schedule and i can finally sleep how ive been dreaming about. but right after he got home he called and said my family want me to take them to the nyc city walk view for a picture itll only take an hour.... it was 9pm and it wouldve been 10pm when he came back and still had to shower etc whatever so 11pm then he calls me and i stilllllll have to sleep at 12am, like always. i was honestly so angry, my family doesnt really respect me and now my boyfriend doesnt really respect me. i called him names, i called his family names, i lashed out on my bed and myself because 6 years of this really does kill me mentally and i alwwys try to understand others but now it feels like im being a doormat. 

  
he told me hes going to bump up the date for his therapist but i truly not see anything changing because i will always feel: 

1:work

2:family

3:me

1kt9f9e,https://i.redd.it/m4na9ycc7g2f1.jpeg,Puppy will not pee outside,"Please help, my puppy is driving me completely insane. He is only 11 weeks old, I’m not expecting perfection or anything, but I take him out first thing in the morning for at least an hour. He sniffs the entire yard, attacks the leaves and branches. We come in just so I can make a coffee (this takes less than 5 minutes) and he pees on the rug. 
I stop him, take him back out, he basically does the same as before. We come back in and if he doesn’t pee on the rug, he pees on the floor. I use the Nature’s Miracle enzyme spray, I steam the rug w a pet urine eliminator. 
I take him out on a leash, he wants to play tug of war, attack leaves, branches, me. He basically cannot focus for the life of him to pee outside. 
Everything I read online talks about following a schedule, taking them out often. I work from home so I can take him out all the time. I am spending so much time outside with him all day and then as soon as we come in he pees. I take him to the quiet side of the house so there are less distractions, I give him praise and treats every time he does go. I just don’t understand. He has learned sit, shake, speak, come easily! I know he can learn, but for some reason this lesson is impossible for him to comprehend!! 
I give him treats and praise when he does it right, I take him out CONSTANTLY, I walk him to the same spot on a leash, I tell him potty. Dude just refuses to learn this. 
I pray he will get this as he gets better bladder control, but I get him every opportunity to go and he just doesn’t. ",12,1747969696.0,puppy,1,1.0,False

1kt9e71,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriajo/comments/1kt9e71/no_strong_independent_women_please/,no strong independent women please,"**About Me**  
I'm a 38, year, old man based in Amman, Jordan, and I travel to the Gulf from time to time for work. I work in tech consulting, focused on user experience and digital innovation. I enjoy what I do, especially the chance to collaborate with people from different cultures and solve real, world challenges through thoughtful design.

**Willingness to Relocate**  
Open to relocating for the right person and right connection. I work remotely, which gives me flexibility.

**Marital Status**  
Single, never married, no children.

**What I’m Looking For**  
I'm looking for a serious and genuine relationship that leads to marriage, ideally within the next year.

Here are three qualities I really value in a life partner:

1. **Kindness** – someone compassionate and emotionally aware.
2. **Curiosity** – a love for learning, asking questions, and growing together.
3. **Emotional maturity** – open communication and grounded values.

I also have a soft personal preference for **redheads** , not a strict requirement, but something I’ve always been drawn to.

**Dealbreaker**  
Dishonesty or emotional manipulation, mutual respect is the foundation of any meaningful connection & my Parents & something holy for me.

**Interests & Hobbies**  
Big fan of good coffee (brewing and tasting, not just caffeine), expressive storytelling, and design. I’m also into painting mixing colours is a real passion, and I admire creative minds like Hideo Kojima. If you love games, films, or art that make you think, we’ll probably click.

**Children**  
Yes, I’d like to have children in the future

**Religious Practice**  
I practice my faith in a personal and respectful way. I appreciate spirituality and values more than labels.

**Ideal Marriage Timeline**  
Within 1 year.",3,1747969595.0,marriajo,0,0.8,False

It was built in 1892 and was just a LOT of work for me. I’m having regrets though, even with how much stress it gave me. The location was incredible, right next to a canyon and a coffee shop and with great access to everything I liked, and I loved the yard. I’m still in it with a leaseback until the end of June. 

I know there’s no sense dwelling but is the regret normal? 

Also, I just need some advice about what to do next. I have a new construction townhouse that I’ve put earnest money on (2,500) but it’s far from my current location, out a ways and not as close to everything I like. Good news is the area is growing really fast, so the property will likely appreciate just as quickly. I can dip in two years if I need to, but also it means construction around me as they build a connecting freeway, more houses, etc. But it will be quite an adjustment, even with it being new construction. And I’m freaking out over the interest rates because over the last two weeks alone they keep rising, so I feel like the payment is going to be a little uncomfortable for me once I lock. I’m trying to hold out a bit but I’m not sure. Any pulses on interest rates in the next two weeks???? 

I’m looking at some plan B’s up in my area. They would be much older but with a lower payment. I’m just sick of constant HUGE repairs and costs from this place. And now my timeline is crazy tight. First time selling and I will not ever do it like this again. 

Also, do I just full send it with the new construction spot, accept the risks, and live frugally? Try to rent a room? Do I rent in the interim myself? Just need some advice rn. 

I’m going to a look at a few more places tomorrow in my own area but there’s nothing new up here and I’m feeling backed into a corner. What’s done is done but I don’t want to make more decisions I’ll regret. ",1,1747968668.0,RealEstateAdvice,11,0.6,False

I have a friend I've known for a long time like more than 15 years na. We're close, and I can say we really know each other well.

All of us in the group know he’s gay, and he’s always been open about it. He often shares his experiences, especially about hookups sa aming mga close friends nya.

Then one day, he told us he wanted to change. He said he no longer wanted that lifestyle—he wanted to get married and have a family.

With the help of a Christian group he had been attending and part sya ng ministry, he met a woman. After a few months of dating, he proposed, and they got married.

Now, they have two children—who are also our inaanaks.

Last year, around Q4, I helped him apply to my company because I thought it would be better for his family, especially in terms of benefits.

After a few tries, he finally got accepted and started working—though in a different department.

I was really happy because now I had someone to eat lunch with at work.

But after a while, something started to feel off. I often saw him outside the building--walking around or just sitting alone in the park.

While taking breaks is okay sa company namen, I felt that, as a newcomer, he should spend more time getting to know his teammates--maybe over coffee in the pantry.

During our lunch breaks, we’d eat together, but I observed he was always busy chatting on his phone. I assumed he was chatting to his wife.

Then one day lunch time, while I was getting water, I accidentally saw his phone screen. It showed a gay hookup app--the same one he used to talk about before.

Grabe ang kaba ko and I hope sana indi ko na lang nakita. After a few days, out of curiosity (and because I felt uneasy), I downloaded the app myself without any photo or details on my profile.

To my surprise, he messaged me--asking for a quick hookup. He even sent some of his pictures. 

And yes… it was him. My friend.

For several nights, I couldn’t sleep. Eventually, I decided to share what happened with two of our closest friends. They were both shocked and saddened, hays. We agreed to meet up with our friend and planned to talk to him about what we found out.

Since our offices are near each other, we chose a nearby coffee shop as our meeting place.

But during the meetup, none of us had the courage to bring it up. We couldn’t say anything--nothing at all.

We just asked how work and family life were going, and said, “If you ever need support, we’re here for you.”

And that was it. We left without saying what really needed to be said. We just messaged each other na ang hirap sabihin, hoping that he would sense we already know. Mahiya ba.

Also we are afraid that saying something might cause his family to fall apart.

This all happened last January.

Life went on, and I continued treating him the same way. I just got a bit busy these past few months with business trips, so I wasn’t able to join him for lunch as often.

But I always believed it was just a phase he needed to go through—and that eventually, he would stop.

Yesterday, out of curiosity (again), I downloaded the app just to check.  And there he was--still on it.

Previous Attempts: We tried confront him, but honestly, it was just too difficult--we didn’t know how to even begin.

1kt8vw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1kt8vw3/westin_st_francis_san_francisco/,Westin St. Francis San Francisco,"https://preview.redd.it/g8z62jw42g2f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bdb3e165e2bfc2ec3a97892ebbf634abf6e6f97

The Westin St. Francis is one of the most iconic hotels in San Francisco. It has a history and heritage dating to before the big earthquake at the turn of the last century.

Having stayed at several other San Francisco hotels, including the Marriott Fisherman’s Wharf, the Fairmont, the Palace, the two Intercontinentals, and the Hyatt Regency, I was excited for my first stay at the Westin St. Francis. It was a mixed experience.

First, the positives:

1. Location, location, location. Union Square is a great part of San Francisco to base yourself. Either for work or pleasure. Almost everything you’ll want to see or do is within walking distance.
2. I was upgraded to a junior suite on the morning of my arrival. I booked a king tower room on points.
3. Rates are reasonable. Both cash and points.
4. The Club Lounge is nice. The selection at breakfast is a little better than average. Smoked salmon, cheeses, fresh berries and fruit, gourmet yogurt, cold-pressed orange juice, eggs, meats, pastries. At night, the offering was also better than many domestic club lounges. Chicken with rice, duck Peking, three types of cheese (and no cubed cheese!), naan bread and humus, etc. Beer and wine weren’t complimentary. $12 for a beer and $19 for a glass of chardonnay. $12-$14 would be reasonable, but even by hotel standards, $19 is excessive. You might as well go to a restaurant or bar at that price.

Now, the negatives:

1. The hotel advertises itself as renovated, but my junior suite was very tired. Except for the TV, a Samsung TV from 2018, I would guess the suite hadn’t been refreshed or renovated in at least 8 years. There were no USB outlets ANYWHERE. How does a hotel not have USB outlets in the year 2025? Two electrical outlets were built into each nightstand, but one wasn’t working. The walls had scuffs and scratches. Ceilings could use a fresh coat of paint. Some parts of the bathroom could use new grouting or sealing. The décor was heavy on browns and beiges. It was the Westin décor that was very popular in the first decade of the 2000s. Nothing about the suite or décor said this was a suite in the historic Westin St. Francis. While they have a lot of historic displays around the hotel showcasing the history and heritage of the hotel, the hotel is a shadow of its former self. The grandeur just isn’t there. It would have been perfectly acceptable for an airport Westin or a Westin in some random suburb. But given the history and heritage of the St. Francis, it was below what you would expect.
2. No real restaurant, besides an overpriced breakfast restaurant. $40 for the buffet or $41 for two eggs with potatoes, bacon or sausage, toast or croissant, and coffee or tea. There’s a lobby grab-and-go market that feels way out of place. The signature bar is still closed for renovations that seem to be dragging on forever. In the lobby market, a can of Pepsi or Diet Pepsi is $7.25. I honestly don't know how a supposedly full-service Westin is allowed to operated without an all-day restaurant. You'd expect a white tablecloth, fine dining restaurant in a hotel like this.
3. The hotel advertises that it has “amenities to match your expectations.” But it doesn’t. There is no turndown housekeeping service despite the turndown service being advertised. There are no newspapers. Only basic toiletries in the bathroom are provided with none of the toiletries you’d expect (like a dental kit, mouthwash, etc.). My bathroom had three face cloths but two hand towels and three body towels. Why the discrepancy? Also, the suite had no stocked mini-bar or even a bottle of water. How does a suite not have a stocked mini-bar? Also missing was a corkscrew. The coffee was cheap unbranded coffee, not the Starbucks coffee you usually get at a Westin.
4. No Bonvoy Ambassador recognition. No in-room F&B amenity or even a thank you card.
5. No pre-arrival email. No welcome letter at check-in explaining hotel amenities, services, F&B outlets.
6. At check-in, the platinum and above Elite Welcome Gift benefit was a choice of 1,000 points or a wine tasting. No breakfast option. I asked and was denied. I then invoked the $100 compensation. The following morning, a manager apologized and acknowledged they are required to offer the breakfast. He offered to pay the $100 but we settled on some drinks when the club lounge is closed on the weekend.
7. The hotel charges a scam resort/destination fee. At check-in, nothing was provided about what is included in the resort/destination fee.
8. Limited staff. No doorman or bellman was working when I arrived. The front desk never offered any assistance with luggage.
9. They have a concierge but the concierge couldn't even tell me where to buy postcards. Seriously? Why even have a concierge if they don't know where to get postcards? And how does a historic hotel like the Westin St. Francis not have its own postcards?

All things considered, once you get past the history and heritage of the St. Francis Hotel, the hotel is at best an average Westin with slightly older or tired rooms. Other parts of the hotel also feel tired and just below the St. Francis’s illustrious past. The amenities and services don’t match what’s advertised nor do they match expectations for a 4-star or 5-star hotel.",2,1747967951.0,marriott,0,1.0,False

Want to know how much website designer cost? It is tricky question, okay? No easy answer! Many things change the price. I will explain it easy for you.

Quick answer? Maybe 50 dollar one hour. Maybe 200 dollar one hour. Big difference, yes? Depend on many things. Do not worry. I explain now. Some people very cheap. Some very costly.

What makes price go up or down? I tell you.

First, how much experience? New designer, low price. Old designer, high price. Makes sense, right? If designer very good at one thing, like helping shop online, price go up. They are web design expert!

Second, where designer live? City cost more. Village cost less. Cost of living. If designer live in America, cost more than India, maybe. Also, If a website designer do UX right, it will cost more.

Third, who you hire? One person? Small company? Big company? One person cheap. Big company costly. Big company has many people! Also consider the scope of work needed.

Fourth, what you want? Simple page? Complex website? Complex website cost more! Need special things? Like payment? Cost more! If they have to start from zero it will cost more.

Fifth, what work designer do? Design only? Or build website? Or write words? Or make it show up on Google? More work, more money! How many pages? How many changes you want? Design is important!

Sixth, how fast you need? Need now? Cost more! Designer must work fast! Or on weekend! Designer need big coffee!

it starts behind the left eye,
always the left—
like it knows
that’s the side where I keep the memory
of my first divorce
and that night in 2012
when I threw up on a Tinder date’s shoes
and he said,
“you’re kinda hot when you’re broken.”

then it spreads,
sliding down the back of my skull
like warm piss in winter.
it hums like a cheap motel fridge
you can’t unplug
and tastes like metal,
like old pennies
and regret
and your grandma’s spoon collection
right before the house got foreclosed.

you can’t see light.
you can’t smell soap.
hell, breathing feels
like a personal insult from God.

so you lie there,
sheets stuck to your thighs,
naked and sweating like a busted radiator
in a July heatwave.
every sound’s a gunshot.
every breath’s a betrayal.
even the dust
hurts.

the cat steps on your belly like it’s payback
for forgetting his birthday.
you consider calling someone,
but who do you call
when your brain’s become a war crime
and all your exes
are busy being decent
for other women?

you think,
maybe if I die,
they’ll finally clean the ceiling fan.
maybe someone will write
“she fought bravely”
in the group chat
before sending a gif
of a raccoon in a trash can.

you remember you used to paint.
you used to drink red wine
and read Neruda out loud
like it meant something.
now, you swallow Excedrin
like communion wafers
and pray for silence
like it’s a lost lover.

the worst part?
when it ends—
because it always does, eventually—
you feel hollow.
like a fruit sucked dry.
like a woman who’s just remembered
the rent is still due
and the car needs oil
and nobody ever loved her
the way she asked to be loved
the first time.

and yet,
you rise.
pee.
wipe.
tie your hair up
like a tired gladiator
and make coffee.

because even pain
can’t take everything,
not today.

I thought the better option was to do a coffee date, it’s quick, and I gave him the weekend which perfectly works for me. He did end up expressing that he was frustrated with me rescheduling. I totally get it and explained it to him if he really wants to meet again. I told him if he’s not up to it just straight up tell me. I’m worried if I over explained myself.
