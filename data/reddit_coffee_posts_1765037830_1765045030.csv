1pfvtum,https://www.reddit.com/r/fitness30plus/comments/1pfvtum/my_goto_foods_for_weight_loss_body_recomposition/,My goto foods for weight loss / body recomposition,"In the past 2.5 years, I've went from 295lbs to 229lbs, 36% body fat to 24% body fat according to my DEXA scans - and consistently \*increased\* my lean muscle mass (dexa scans say I'm in the 96 percentile for muscle mass). I'm 56 years old, 178cm tall. I eat a high-protein diet and try to hit the gym 5 days a week.

Here's my goto foods for my body recomposition journey. Feel free to share yours!

# Food List

\- **Eggs** (4 a day every other day for breakfast)  
\- **Chicken breast** (best source of protein; try to avoid breaded chicken. I prefer trader joe's chili lime chicken - it's seasoned and has some sodium, but tastes amazing and can be eaten cold).   
\- **Sirloin steak** (another amazing source of protein; I prefer Costco grass-fed pre-sliced sirloin. cost effective, seasoned just enough and very safe to eat cold if in a hurry..  
\- **Salmon & Tuna steaks**. Don't get salmon with season or sauce, just plain salmon steaks. tuna steaks can be easily seared quickly in canola oil for an amazing meal! right now seared tuna is my top meal  
\- **Edamame, Avocado and Broccoli** \- my 3 go-to vegetables. high in fiber and potassium. I mix half an avocado with chicken breast, lime and cumin for an amazing lunch daily, and try to have Edamame or Brocolli with steak or fish for dinner.  
\- **Blueberries, Blackberries, Bananas** \- my go-to fruits; banana for the potassium  
\- **Unflavored Greek yogurt** (I blend non-fat with full-fat and add a little strawberry preserves for  sweetness). this is generally my evening dessert.  
\- **Protein Shake:** I combine whey isolate, 5mg creatine, unsweetened almond milk, walnuts, hemp/flax seed, frozen blueberries, and frozen kale/spinach for an amazing tasting, healthy shake. I have my shake in-between lunch and dinner each day.

# Snacks:

\- Zero sugar beef sticks

\- Low fat mozzarella sticks

\- Pistachios (don't have too many)

\- Hard cheese (limit to 1 oz!)

\- Dark chocolate (small amounts)

Note: - most of those snacks are a little high in sodium ,but if you doing some walking/hiking/cardio each day and sweating it should be fine. Too much sodium and you retain water and get bloated - no fun!

# Cheat Meals:

\- I don't generally do cheat meals as they will set you back immensely and imho aren't worth it. but I do have coffee with half and half and a little sugar every morning - can't give that up!

# Changing up your diet:

\- I do best when I stick to the same routine and foods. so I pretty much try to eat only the foods every day, in my above list. Because I've analyzed the calories per portion for all of them, I can easily stick to 2,500 calories a day with those foods and know exactly how much I can eat to hit my target. But if you need more variety, I get it! This diet gives me about 200g protein and 150g carbs daily - perfect amounts for body recomposition and reducing hunger.

# What I avoid:

\- **Food in a box:** I learned via trial and error that almost all food that come's in boxes is very high sodium, or has too much added highly processed foods; there's some exceptions, but still.... read labels and ingredients carefully  
\- **Restaurant food**: I learned the hard way, it is impossible to trust just about any restaurant food; it will inevitably be high in salt, sugar, unhealthy oils, etc. There's a few exceptions, but if you really want to succeed in losing weight and body recomposition - best to avoid restaurants, parties, etc.  
\- **Processed food:** this goes without saying - you have to avoid like the plague sodas, candies, cookies, pastries, ice cream, juice, white bread, ""package meals""; rice & pasta in small amounts;  
\- **Cheese, Nuts, Peanut Butter, Sauces, Butter** \- be very carefully and measure these with a food scale; they are dense in calories, and it's very easy to overeat quickly, and I've killed my calorie count many times this way

# Supplements, Workout and Cardio.

\- I take a multi-vitamin daily, 200mg magnesium glycinate at night, and fish oil on days I don't eat salmon for omega-3's. And protein powder + creatine goes into my daily shake.

\- I try to get to the gym 5 days a week. I try to walk or hike for an hour most days. It's especially important to take a walk right after a big meal - at a minimum, take a walk after dinner. Drink lots of water, get 8 hours sleep.

# Blood work & Visceral fat:

\- following this diet, my blood sugar, H1aC and cholesterol greatly improved and is now amazing! I also lost a lot of visceral fat as indicated in my DEXA scans. Recent calcium test had an amazing score of zero.

**Hope this is helpful to someone!** What is your favorite food list? What is your body recomb journey? I still have 15lbs to go, wish me luck!

1pfvtpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pilates/comments/1pfvtpk/gift_ideas_for_instructors/,Gift ideas for Instructors,"Hi!  Lots of posts lately across different Pilates and Yoga subs asking for ideas for Instructor gifts.  As a studio owner/Instructor, here are the real gifts we want.

1)  A funny or heartfelt card with a personal note from you​.  Instructors spend a lot of time with clients, especially our one-to-ones and getting a card with their favorite or funny memory always makes my day.

  
2) A really good solid review on Google, Facebook, our websites.   Testimonials that include what you love about our classes and real results you've experienced.  How have we made your life better?  Who would you recommend our services to?

If you can write one great review and post it on all of our platforms, it's the best gift you can give.  

It can be hard/awkward to ask clients for reviews or testimonials or clients have the best intentions to write one and then life happens, so when folks do it on their own, it's a wonderful surprise and a great marketing tool for your Instructors.

  
3) If you're a tangible gift person, gift cards for a local coffee shop, am\*zon or Target or wherever, groceries or visa gcs are great and very helpful.  



4) Nothing!  Just wish us a happy holiday season!  There is no expectation of gifts at all.

  
Please avoid the following gifts unless your Instructor talked about an item specifically:  mugs, candles, lotions, socks, mats, water bottles, tshirts, chapsticks, anything scented, homemade food items,​ etc.

1pfvsz3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pfvsz3,Your Fresh Roasted Premium Coffee Tastes Like Crap,"# Your Fresh Roasted Premium [Coffee](https://ethicalfashionguatemala.com/what-about-what-we-wear/) Tastes Like Crap?

Central America is famous for producing some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted premium Coffee, and living in Guatemala means we can go directly to the farms to source the real thing. High Mountain, Single Origin, Shade Grown Arabica from exceptional varietals. Hand-roasted in small lots. Our mornings begin with cups that carry natural notes of honey and chocolate. Pure and uncomplicated.

[Guatemalan coffee](https://ethicalfashionguatemala.com/xocomil-shuttle-services-trusted-private-transport-across-guatemala/) is respected worldwide for its strong profile, moderate acidity, full body, and layered flavors. The real magic isn’t just the plants. It’s the volcanic soil, high altitudes, perfect microclimates, and generations of growers who understand how to bring out the best in every bean.

Most of the coffee varietals grown in Guatemala are Typica and Bourbon, but farms also cultivate Catuai, Caturra, and Pache. Each varietal offers its own flavor characteristics, and farmers can even dry the coffee cherries to sell as cascara, adding valuable income to their harvest.

# So why does your Fresh Roasted Premium Coffee taste like crap?

Ethical Fashion Guatemala coffee clients often comment on the dramatic difference between our Guatemala coffee and the coffee they were used to buying from roasters or grocery chains in the United States. One of the biggest reasons is simple. Most commercial coffee is mixed. Beans from different farms, different regions, and even different varietals are combined to meet volume demands. And once coffee is roasted, its peak flavor lasts for only one month. The longer it sits on shelves, the worse it tastes.",1,1765044601.0,EthicalFashionGuatema,0,0.99,False

1pfvrn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1pfvrn0/claimed_by_a_biker_giant/,Claimed by a biker giant,"Looks like such a good read but of course found Facebook tied to a bad pay crazy amounts to read 

On my boyfriend's birthday, I accidentally heard he fu-cked my sister and even worse, she got pregnant!
Walking in the back door, I heard voices from Dad's office, the door slightly ajar.
""We never planned for it to happen."" My sister's voice. She said softly, as if she were some kind of victim; she was an expert at that.
""Christmas day, before I knew it, we were ki-ssing and things got heated, and ended up in Maxine's bed, like I said, and I was so lost that I forgot to use a con-dom."" My boyfriend continued.
""He gave me the best Christmas present ever. We should get married."" My sister crowed with delight. I could imagine her tenderly touching her belly. 
My heart just hit the floor, as I took in that my sister and boyfriend did the dirty in my bed at Christmas.
MY BED. I slept in that bed, with their jizz on the sheets.
I suddenly felt sick at that thought. How could they do that to me?
She stole another boyfriend from me again.
And he? He continued to pretend, ki-ssing me and taking me out on dates, as if that never happened.
I couldn't take it any longer and pushed the door open.
""Fu-ck you all, jerk.""
——
""Go home, you have worked too much overtime this week. Have an early night and give that boyfriend of yours an early treat."" My boss practically pushed me out the door, a wicked grin on his face.
""Okay, okay, I'm going. I'm going. I straddled my bike and started her up. This was going to be a great night.
Today was my boyfriend's birthday, and I was going to give him my V-card as a special gift. I had brought new lingerie, black lace, see-through, and I had shaved my mound, leaving a trail that looked like an arrow pointing down to my juncture.
I was ready to give him my all, my first, my heart, take the big plunge. I felt I was ready.
I pulled into the driveway to see my sister's and my boyfriend's cars. I had no idea my sister was coming home today. She was still at college in her final year, though I heard she wasn't doing so well. The poor golden girl has not met up with expectations, not that I was worried.
My ex-boyfriend showed up three hours early; our date was not for a few more hours.
What was he doing here already?
Walking in the back door, I heard voices and headed towards them; they were in Dad's office, with the door slightly ajar. I moved silently to the door and waited outside to hear what secrets they were having now. They occasionally do this when they are planning something and don't want to include me, but I'm puzzled as to why my boyfriend and sister were included.
""We never planned for it to happen."" My sister replied softly, as if she were some kind of victim; she was an expert at that. She should have been an actress; she would have won multiple Oscars by now.
""When?"" Dad asked, and I waited in the hallway to hear what this was all about.
""Christmas day, we had too many of your special eggnogs, and things got heated. The party was more or less over; the presents had been given out, and the food had been eaten. We were all mulling around, talking, when Zoey said something, I don't remember what-but we went upstairs to continue talking, and ended up in Maxine's room. We did start by just talking, and before I knew it, we were ki-ssing and things got heated, and ended up in her bed, like I said, and I was so lost in that moment that I forgot to use a con-dom. When we came out, no one seemed to notice we had been gone, so we pretended it never happened."" My boyfriend replied, and my heart just hit the floor, as I took in that my sister and boyfriend did the dirty in my bed at Christmas.
MY BED.
I slept in that bed, with their jizz on the sheets.
I feel suddenly sick at that thought. How could they do that to me?
She stole another boyfriend from me again. But he was just as much to blame; I guess our relationship was not that strong yet. Not on his side at least. He continued to pretend, ki-ssing me and taking me out on dates, as if that never happened.
What a jerk.
Now I feel cheated, dirty, ashamed, and angry all at once. What if she hadn't gotten pregnant, and I ended up married to that cheating scumbag? Would her wedding present be to tell me she had slept with him first? I wouldn't put it past her to do such a thing. She had done that before with my boyfriends, and I guess this one was just as vulnerable to her advances as the last one.
""He gave me the best Christmas present ever."" My sister crowed with delight. I could imagine her tenderly touching her belly.
""This is good news. I have wanted grandchildren, and the last grandchild I would have expected would be from you; you have never kept a relationship for long."" Mum said, sounding excited at the news.
""What now?"" My sister asked, still playing the perfect victim.
""We get married?' My now ex-boyfriend suggested -sounds more like a question.
""What about Maxine?"" My sister asked, as if I were an inconvenience that needed to be sorted out, and now they think about me, but it didn't sound like concern.
""What about her? This is about my first grandchild, and his or her safety comes first. She will have to live with it."" My mother spat, revealing that famous favoritism, because she had always taken my sister's side in everything, even when proven wrong. They never backed me up.
""I am technically her boyfriend."" He started to say something, but was interrupted.
""Not anymore, you're not. I will arrange with the local publican to hire the outdoor garden area, and we shall have an engagement party this Saturday. Get that sorted before you start to show, and Maxine will show her support."" Dad's voice floated out, sounding resolute. I had no say in this, not that I wanted to be his girlfriend any longer; he had proven not to be what I wanted in a guy.
""She will have to leave. I need her room for the nursery. I would prefer it if she didn't attend the engagement party. What will those who know she was the real girlfriend show up, and see that it was not Maxine getting engaged?"" Mum added. Yep, that was my mother, trying to regain her dignity and save face.
I couldn't take it any longer. I was devastated enough, and listening further to their support for the love for the cheater was eating me up inside. I didn't want to cry in front of them; the tears were a mix of anger and hurt.
I pushed the door open, revealing myself standing there.
All faces turned to look at me.
""Let me get this straight. You took my boyfriend to MY bed, did the dirty with him, leaving your mess in my bed, as a sort of Christmas present for me. Guess that made your day, thinking I was sleeping in your mess. Now you want my bedroom for the bast-ard baby you have created, and I am what, just pushed out the door? Like yesterday's trash?"" I asked to ensure I understood correctly that the whole family was fine with me being tossed aside.
""Exactly, I am taking your boyfriend, your bedroom, and you, my dear sister, have to move out."" My sister sounded like she had won the lottery. Her face beamed at her triumph.
""Fine with me."" The look of shock would have made me laugh if I were not so numb inside. I moved away to my room and packed what I could into my duffel bag. I will come back for the rest later, when they are not around.
My heart was breaking, not because I lost my boyfriend, although that hurt a lot, considering that what I was going to give him for his present today was saved for doing something stupid at least. But also because both parents were supporting this deception, as if it were the best news they had received in a while, that they had been trying to get rid of me for a while, and now succeeded in a spectacular way.
I walked downstairs and looked at them.
""When I find a place to stay, I will be back for the rest."" I spat at them, a mixture of hurt, anger, and defeat. I never fit into the family, a black sheep, so maybe I should become one. I had always had top grades, won awards, done my best, but even being first, I was still last.
My best friend was the only place I could think of going to; it had to be temporary. Jenny will be cool and let me sleep on her couch till I find a new home. I climbed onto my bike and took off to the only sanctuary I had over the years.
Jenny welcomed me into her home, like I knew she would, and together we had a pity party consisting of beer and vanilla fudge ice cream. We called the family and my ex some interesting names, some of which I had never heard before, but they sounded good. The drunker I got, the more inventive the names became.
The next morning, after waking up on Jenny's couch and remembering yesterday, it did not go as planned. I pulled myself together, had a quick shower, and left for work. It was eight in the morning, and Jenny was still asleep when I left. That might be okay for some, but my workday today would be ten hours long, and I was running late.
""You're late, night must have gone better than planned,"" Mike said jovially. They sort of knew what I was planning last night. The others chuckled along with Mike. I grumbled some shiet and got to work.
By the end of the day, Mike pulled me to his office.
""Okay, out with it. The guys have been tiptoeing around you all day. What happened? He rejected your advances?"" He asked, his hand on my shoulder, keeping me in place, looking at me with concerned eyes, a father figure, better than my dad had ever been.
So, I told him what happened when I got home and where I spent the night, and now I'm looking for a place to stay. I was proud of myself; I didn't cry, or whine, or show any emotion at all -just explained my predicament in cold, emotionless words. Clear and succinct.
He said he wouldn't say anything in the shop, but would talk to the prez. I had no idea why, but I was not in the right frame of mind to question it.
Today was my sister's engagement party; engaged to my ex-boyfriend.
Yeah, you heard me right, my ex. What a joke that was.
I had been dating Dan for six months when my sister, who was a year older than I, came home for Christmas and ended up in bed with my boyfriend. She's a shameless hussy, always has been, but I never expected him to sleep with her. I thought we were secure in our relationship.
The only good thing I took away from this was that I never went to bed with him; my virgi-nity card was still intact, not that I was trying to keep it - I just never got the chance to lose it. She always managed to have any guy I was interested in dump me for her, and when she got bored with them, she'd move on. So, in a way, I didn't have a boyfriend till she moved out of her home and headed to college.
But when my sister came home and met him, she seduced him and got pregnant. He did the whole 'get down on one knee and proposed' scene. Apparently, it was romantic, but I wasn't there when he did it because they didn't want me around. It hurt a lot at the time, and I was glad to have my girlfriends around me, helping me get over it.
They say, I dodged a bullet.
I agree with them, stupidly.
He might have been a sports jock with good looks, but doing this tells me he was weak and shallow, and I was too good for him, or so my BFF says. I prefer to believe them over the excuses my ex made.
I had to move out of my home after I had a massive fight with my parents a few days ago, when the truth was exposed; they supported her, not me, and the next thing I knew, I was out the door and the evil sister. The engagement party was intended to introduce him to her friends and make the relationship official, but I was not invited. My parents want nothing to do with me. I made them all uncomfortable, considering he was my boyfriend first. Anyone working out the timeline for the baby can piece it together, and see they were cheating on me, and it would have been awkward, and too many questions would have been raised.
Not that I needed to say all of that, I kind of said it all before, but grrrrr, I am so angry at how my so-called 'family' kicked me out of my so-called home, with no care for me or my feelings.
It was easier to push me away and disown me than have to explain to them that my sister cheated with my boyfriend, and hey presto, a baby was on the way.
Because I was kicked out of the house, and only had a short time to pack anything, I took the opportunity of the party to sneak into the house and take more of my possessions, like opening my father's safe, and grabbing every piece of paper relating to me, and a little money too, no a lot of money, and grandma's jewelry that she left me.
So, with the help of my BFF, we packed my belongings and took them to her place until I found a new one. I ride a motorcycle, so I need help. I have the money to buy a new place, but I'm unsure if I want to stay in this town now. Once my apprenticeship is over, I might move away. I stayed that night at Jenny's place, as I figured out what to do.
Today, I am moving into my new place -a bungalow above the bike shop where I work. I am in my final year of apprenticeship, and I am a motorcycle mechanic, proud of it, I might add. I can also work on cars and trucks. If it had a motor, I could fix it; I always could, thanks to my knack for it, which I developed since I was eight, when I fell in love with engines. My Grandpa taught me, kept me out of everyone's way. I guess you could say I was a tomboy, with no frills and lace. My Grandpa kept me sane and busy, so the BS in our house didn't hurt me as much.
The place has two bedrooms and is fully contained, meaning it has everything I need. I had purchased some new sheets and towels, that sort of thing, but it had a fully stocked kitchen; I only needed to buy the food. It might be small, and above a noisy bike shop, but at night it was a quiet area. No one would break into this shop; the local bikie gang owned it. They were good guys, scary, but so far, no trouble for me.
My BFF, Jenny, was helping me take my belongings upstairs when a group of bikers arrived and assisted us. I had five boxes and two suitcases filled with all sorts of items.
""Thanks, guys, for the help,"" I said sweetly, my BFF batting her eyes at them and swaying her hips suggestively as she walked and thanked them.
She makes me laugh with her antics, which are totally opposite to mine. I like jeans and am rarely seen in a dress, whereas she was seldom seen in jeans.
""We got a party at the clubhouse, tomorrow Saturday, you should come and relax a bit, bring your girls with ya,"" Bruiser suggested as he threw his arm over my shoulder, walked me to the settee, pushed me down, and handed me a beer they had brought with them.
This was how they acted around me, ordered me about. Sometimes, I'm okay with it; other times, I get all worked up and growl back at them. Today was acceptance. I know they mean well, and I feel lucky to have them as family; they try to make me feel better.
""That sounds like a blast, count me in, and I can bring two other girl friends with us. Max, do you want me to pick you up?"" Jenny offered, taking a beer from one of the guys. She was not a beer drinker; however, in this situation, I could see her not refusing anything they offered. I guess I'm going, whether I want to or not.
""No, I'll ride over,"" I replied as one of the guys ordered pizza.
""That's the spirit. Nothing like the wind in your hair to blow the cobwebs away."" They stayed because they didn't want me to be alone, not on my first night here.
Pizza arrived not long after, and my little bungalow was soon feeling too small and crowded, with six huge bikers in the room. Some sat on the floor; others pulled up one of the three kitchen chairs. I know, I know, three chairs sound odd, but that's what was here, and beggars can't be choosers; the rent was dirt cheap, and I think the boys are the ones to make sure I had everything I needed.
They found out about my situation the next day, because, I was still quiet at work, which was not like me, often I am singing to the radio, or swearing at something, so one of the guys approached me, to find out what gives, and I softly told them, what went down, and when word got around the bikers heard I needed a place to stay, because I was kicked out of my home and why, they came to me, like protective brothers. Now I have a whole gang of bikers who have my back. I feel privileged to call them friends.
They even offered to rough the ex up for me, but I refused the offer, because strangely, I was happy to get rid of the loser if he was a cheating bast-ard. Better now than when I am fully invested in our relationship. Plus, I was in deep enough shi-te with my parents and sister without making it worse.
The pizza was gone, my BFF left for home, and the guys did too. It was late, well, for me, midnight. I usually fall asleep quickly because I have to be up for work at five. Tomorrow, being Saturday, I have the morning shift before the party later. They let me leave work early so I can move in here.
""Hey, don't forget to come, we need our prettiest mechanic at the party, some of the boys might need a tune-up,"" Bruiser said with a laugh as they climbed on their bikes and left. I know what sort of tune-up he was talking about, and it had nothing to do with a motor.
I looked around my new home. It wasn't much, but it was all mine. The guys were great; they took the empty pizza boxes and beer cans with them, and the place was relatively clean. Not at all what you would expect from a group of rowdy men.
The clubhouse.
I had never been to it, despite having worked there for nearly four years, and they had never extended an invitation to me. I know they had lots of parties; maybe I was too young. I turned twenty recently, but they might think of me as the fifteen-year-old who showed up one day and told the boss I was going to be his apprentice. He laughed at first and said he would give me a go to prove myself. He thought I was joking and that I would be gone by the weekend, but over the holidays, I worked hard and have been here ever since.
The beeping sound of my phone alarm made me sit up and look around. It took a moment to remember where I was. The room had a small curtain that barely kept the light out. There was a streetlight just outside my window. I can envisage myself getting better blackout curtains soon. Although it was annoying, it wasn't among my top priorities for making this a home.
The shower was decent, with nice pressure. I followed my morning routine, only to realize how foolish I was to wake up so early, living above my place of work; I didn't need to ride here. After finishing breakfast and cleaning up the kitchen, I still had half an hour before I needed to be at work.
I had two ways to get into my place: one was through the back stairs, and the other was through the shop. With the code to turn off the alarm, I decided to head down and start work early. It was better than moving stuff around; I can do that later. I had a bike to finish by this afternoon. The customer would be here at two.
Turned off the alarm, turned on the coffee pot, the radio, and headed to my workstation, where the fat boy was waiting for me to finish. I sat on the stool with casters and began my job, singing loudly to the heavy rock song that came on the radio as I installed the new spark plugs and double-checked the oil. It was a simple, easy-peasy service. Once finished, I started the bike up, let it idle while I made coffee, then returned to rev it a few times. It sounds lumpy, like it was just turning over perfectly; it was music to my ears. I love that throaty, deep, lumpy sound. You can feel it vibrate through my chest.
""That's a sound I loved to hear as I enter work."" My boss, Mike, said as I turned the bike off.
""It's ready to go, unless you want to take it out for a test ride. Want a coffee, pots hot."" I offered as I threw the dirty rag in the bin.
""Sure, I will take the bike out for a spin, and you can make me a coffee."" He smirked as he grabbed the bike. I opened the garage door, and Mike took off. I smiled as he disappeared down the street, and I turned to make both of us coffee. If you hadn't guessed already, I would drink a lot of coffee. I am not a fan of soft drinks or tea; for me, it's coffee or water.
With a broom in hand, I began cleaning the shop. I am not out here very often, but I try to sweep the floor at least once a week; they have another apprentice who's a second year, who gets to do most of the cleaning up, but he's never here on a Saturday.
The sound of the bike returning prompted me to pick up the two cups of coffee and head back out to the workshop. Mike had a massive grin on his face as he parked the bike.
""Great job, you are our top mechanic. But don't tell anyone, or I will have to deny it."" He joked, taking his coffee from my hand as he walked by, no doubt letting the customer know the bike was ready ahead of time.
I moved to the next bike, which was a total rebuild; it had been in a minor accident, and while the frame was being checked, I would work on the engine and gearbox. It was the only job on my list at the moment. The bike owner was in no hurry; he had a broken leg, giving me a few weeks to work on his bike and any urgent jobs that might come into the shop.
The client arrived and happily took possession of his bike, very happy with the job done.
""I hear you've been invited to the club party tonight,"" Mike said as he rang up the sale on the cash register.
""Yep."" I said popping the 'p'.
""You can leave now, we have no more customers expected. Good job today."" It was close to one o'clock, near the time I would knock off.
""Thanks, boss."" I saluted him and rushed upstairs, before he could change his mind. Giggling all the way up. I heard him chuckling as he locked the door below, behind me.
I decided on a quick shower; I didn't want to smell of oil when going to a party. Put on my skinny black jeans, a black blouse that had red flames on the back and on the pockets, black boots that had some chains around the ankle, and hair in a ponytail. I will get what we call helmet hair, so it's a waste to do much with it now. I use mascara and strawberry lip gloss, which is more to moisturize my lips, which tend to dry out when I ride my bike, and that's it. The last thing I grabbed before leaving was my jacket.
My mum used to grumble that I wasn't like my sister and put more effort into my appearance, but I like who I am, and I didn't like wearing lots of makeup; it was my choice, and I feel that I am not a frilly, lacey chick. It was a deal breaker with my mum. She had my sister dress up and left me in the care of Grandpa until he died when I was seventeen.
It broke me when he left the world. He was the only person who got me. My grandma had been gone since I was young, and I filled the hole in his heart with my love for bikes and fishing. He left me his money and bikes. Dad got his house and business. My mum hated that I gained all that money. When Grandma died, she left me her jewelry, and Grandpa made sure to keep it safe till I was old enough to have it.
I ate something and put some more of my stuff in the cupboards before my phone chimed to let me know my girlfriends were on their way to the party.
I pulled my bike out of the small garage and started it up. I threw my leg over and took off, heading to the property. The clubhouse was half an hour out of town, set on a large property a little bit back from the road.
Ten minutes later, I came up behind the girls and hung out behind them. My friend waved me on to take the lead. I shrugged and overtook her. The turn off arrived, and I rode happily up the long drive, and trees lined the road. An open, large steel gate appeared, and I was glad it was still enough light to see clearly.
Men stood by the entrance, watching us arrive.
""Hey."" I greeted the biggest man I had ever seen.
""Who invited you here?"" The man asked gruffly, in a deep husky voice.
""Bruiser,"" I answered, with a firm, clear voice, hoping that the fact that he frightened me would be noticed in my voice.
He pulled out his phone and called, I assumed, Bruiser.
""Max?"" He asked, as he looked at me questioningly, and I nodded. He said something more and hung up the phone.
""Come in, the car behind your girls?"" He looked at the car behind, which clearly had a woman in it.
""Yep,"" I replied, not at all liking how he intimidated me with his manner.
Perhaps it was the way they greeted strangers.

1pfvrg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Matcha/comments/1pfvrg4/dark_green_bitter_matcha_latte/,Dark Green Bitter Matcha Latte,"

I’ve been making my own iced matcha lattes at home. Usually I’ll do it with matchabar powder, which I know isn’t anything special, just run of the mill matcha, but it tastes good enough in an oat milk latte for me. I’ll typically do a teaspoon of matcha in it. 

Recently, I went to a local coffee spot and ordered a matcha latte with oat milk. It came out a very dark green, while mine are typically a much more vibrant light green. 

I tasted it and it was honestly disgusting - extremely bitter with no sweetness at all. I couldn’t even finish it. 

I then saw a girl pickup hers and it was a much lighter green, similar to mine that I make at home. 

Every now and then I’ll get SBs, and generally it’s a light green, but every now and then it’s a dark green and bitter as well. 

My question is, what exactly is the reason that sometimes the coffee shop matcha lattes are coming out dark green and bitter? Is it simply too much matcha powder, or is it something like using water that’s too hot to mix it?

The difference in taste between the two are crazy! I actually get a sick feeling after drinking the dark green bitter ones. ",2,1765044495.0,Matcha,0,1.0,False

Third: I started trying to learn about Christianity. One afternoon, I had just been reading about Christianity on a webpage in a room at school and was about to get up to make a cup of coffee, when I suddenly noticed an unremarkable Bible on the bookshelf!

\-NAS Predators v CAR Hurricanes Under 6.0 (-110) | 0.5 Units

  

**Why This Pick?** 

This is a bold pick, I know – especially given how capable the Hurricanes can be at home. That said, Juuse Saros has held opponents to just 1-goal/piece in his last two outings – this dude is dialled at the moment. Meanwhile, Carolina has (surprisingly!) only bagged 1 goal in each of their last 2 outings, 2 goals or fewer in 4 of their last 5, and their last 5 straight games have seen 6 goals or less. Call me crazy, but I’m on the Under to cash here. 



*\*Note: Keep your eyes peeled for confirmation that Saros gets the start.*

I always drink a specific brand, Hagen instant coffee, which comes in a pack of individuals satchels of instant coffee that you can pour into a cup and then add hot water. For months of drinking it, I’ve never had a problem. 

However; with the newest package I bought, a week ago I tore open a satchel as usual and made a cup. I felt perfectly fine while drinking it, but after about 10-15 minutes after I finished the cup, I began to feel serious, awful nausea. I was so nauseous I almost thought I was going to throw up. I took antihistamine and famotidine, but the nausea continued to last for almost 2 hours afterwards. No other usual allergy symptoms—no throat tightness or itchiness, etc, just severe nausea. 

At first I thought it was a fluke, but today I tried another satchel from the same package, and the exact same situation happened. It’s also not intrinsic to the coffee itself, because my mother has since made coffee with satchels from from that package with no issues whatsoever. 

Why would I be fine with one package but not the other, when they are made with the exact same formula? Is it possible that there is mold in the coffee, and that’s what I’m reacting to? Usually with reactions to foods, I get typical preanaphylaxis symptoms like tightness in the throat, itchy/numb throat or mouth, itchy skin, sometimes stomach pain, etc. But I don’t feel any of those symptoms with the coffee, so I’m not sure how to classify my reaction.

It's a throwaway account for a reason. Thank you in advance for reading and providing thoughtful comments.

Background:

I'm a male immigrant who's worked and lived in the US for almost 10 years. The first time (4 months for work) that I was in the US, I was located in a smaller city in the Midwest and became friends with a family (husband, wife and an infant) through a common friend. We hit it off, hung out a lot, and over that summer I was introduced and became friends with the entire extended family (parents, siblings, siblings' spouses and kids on both sides).

We kept in touch even after I returned home from my work travel and remained great friends.

Eventually, a couple of years later, I moved to the US permanently but lived in a different city. I would see them a couple of times every year but definitely over the holidays as they had now become more like family than just friends.

Over the years, we have taken trips together. They've, along with some family, and friends, visited my home country a couple of years back and we also went to Europe earlier this year during their son's (the infant I met is almost a teenager now) Spring Break.

My parents and sibling really likes them even though they've hardly spent much time in person. They're also grateful that I've a family away from home in a country that I didn't grow up in. I'm also extremely fond of them and love both their sons (they have a younger son who's school-aged and I've known him his whole life).

They've been extremely helpful over the years helping me with questions, with life, and everything that comes with moving to a completely different country as an adult. During that work trip when I first met them, they had taken me grocery shopping, helped me find a cell phone connection, answered all my questions, and of course made me feel welcome and like family. When I moved permanently, even though they weren't in the same city, they helped by answering questions, providing recommendations and providing social and cultural context when I had questions. (They have never had to help me financially. This is just for context as I'm sure people might wonder. Also, I'm not an exchange student thus they're not my host family or anything like that). I am beyond grateful for their support and have always been thankful to God/universe/higher power for this connection.

Present:

Earlier this year, I had the opportunity with work to move to their city. They weren't the only reason but a major reason that I chose to relocate. Work and career goals were the other reasons.

Even though we live in the same city, I live close to work and in downtown as I'm in a long-distance relationship, middle aged, no kids, in upper management at work so extremely busy, no drama, no toxic relationships/dating etc. I live close to work so that I can walk there daily, which provides me the right balance of exercise, social connection, and sunshine (not for the next 5 months apparently lol). I enjoy volunteering, trying new restaurants, travelling, working out, learning new things, credit card points and miles, and various other things. My gf lives in a major city that's a 3 hours drive, 30 minutes flight and we're trying to bridge that gap in the next year.

Issues:

Several years back, during Christmas when I was visiting my friends, I found a small brown Santa soft toy in my stocking. I thought it was a gag gift. I'm pretty easy going and look at the lighter side of things so even though I thought it was weird, my friends were laughing and so I took it as funny. It didn't stop there. Over the next years, I got brown Santa coffee mugs, brown Nutcracker statues, brown Santa things to hang, brown Santa ornaments, brown Santa figurines etc. These gifts always made me feel weird but my friends kept thinking it is funny. I told myself that it's not something for me to get upset about and ruin our friendship however they also got me a brown Nutcracker when they visited my home country. I was aghast and told them that I don't want any more of these gifts. I said it politely but firmly. They just laughed and said that the items were cute etc. Since I made it clear, they keep sending me photos of brown Santa/Christmas items while they're holiday shopping and asking me if they can get them for me. Things like brown Santa portraits, figurines, mugs, signs, etc. Every time I politely and firmly decline. Every time, it is met with ohh but it would look great in your apartment kind of texts and comments. I've actively reduced the time I spend with my friends and their family for several other reasons (I won't delve into those) however I don't feel comfortable or welcome as I used to. 

Last evening, I went to celebrate Christmas with their family. They celebrate early as their parents are snow birds. I got presents for most of them who I interact with and have a great friendship with. I like thoughtful presents and spend hours researching or asking for recommendations. Since I didn't grow up here buying presents is stressful for me as it is not just expensive but also very time intensive as I want those presents to be meaningful, somewhat useful and something that will bring happiness to the receiver. (I've made mistakes with not so good/useful gifts in the past but my friends have never complained).

I was handed a present yesterday by the older son and I gave him a hug and thanked him. The gift was wrapped and his mom (my friend) wanted me to unwrap it. She told me he picked and wrapped it himself. I was very moved as I've known this little human since when he was an infant. The gift was a brown Santa soap dispenser. I cannot describe my emotions when I saw it. In spite of several times and a couple of years of telling them that I don't want such gifts they thought it was totally okay. I've never felt this disrespected and my boundaries overstepped. I didn't say anything except for the fact that I didn't need this. My friend kept speaking about how they were not allowed by me to get me these things but they figured their son can. She also added that at this point it's a joke!!! I left the party wondering if it was not a joke at some point of time and they wanted me to feel racially attacked and I didn't?

Questions for this community:
1. Am I overreacting by feeling disrespected and my race being my only identifier for my friends?
2. What do you think is the best course of action from here onwards?
3. Can this situation be redeemed or do I continue to choose to ignore things to maintain our friendship?
4. Should I eventually show this post to them?

1pfvd79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Holistichealing4HSV/comments/1pfvd79/seeking_a_literal_permanent_cure/,"Seeking a Literal, Permanent Cure","I believe hsv can be cured with 100% eradication from the body. However, I’m not yet sure what method or methods I need to enact to achieve this goal. I am hopeful that someone here already has the answer. 

My issue is that my diet is basically all arginine and coffee, and while I can cut the coffee, the other piece is a non-negotiable. My lifestyle was 100% working for me before infection. After infection my lifestyle has been a living hell, and I feel sick from the virus at least once a month, and this is in conjunction with many things I’m taking to kill the virus. 

***I am only interested in learning how to cure the virus. If you have notes on how to reduce its spread, and suppress, fantastic, please share; but more specifically, I find sorting through comments saying “It can’t be cured” is an inefficiency, and I would ask you to hold your tongue if that’s all you have to contribute*** *(given how this post was originally received in the main forum, but this may be more of a formality here)*.

My intention is to cure this thing, and I want a test proving it has been cured. 

**So far, I’m considering:**

**MMS/ CDS therapy:**
Even though it comes with risks. It could potentially destroy it completely. I’ve read anecdotal reports that it works. Have not started yet, and am not convinced I want to, but I am determined to kill this thing, so I might. I also have access to DMSO.

**H2O2 Therapy.**
The issue: H2O2 is broken down via the catalase enzymes, making this potentially less effective. I’ve also read that it works, but am less convinced. Like MMS, this could still potentially harm the kidneys even though H2O2 is a natural signaler, and is used by the immune system. 

**Mysore St Johns.**
I’ve heard Mysore St. John’s could be an actual cure, but it’s hard to find information online. 

**Dragon’s Blood:**
I’ve read that **Dragons Blood** has shown to be a virucidal anti-viral for HSV2, so I might start taking that. But I haven’t been able to find testimonials supporting using it internally, so I’m not sure if the virucidal properties could kill the virus in latency. Externally, sure. Though I’ve yet to try it. 

**BHT:**
Haven’t read much about it yet, but have heard it is a great suppresser. 

**What I am already doing:**

Monolaurin: 3-9grams a day (or Lauricidin)

Lemon balm tea: 2-3 times a day 

Olive Leaf Extract: 2-3 times daily

Oregano extract: 2-3 times daily

Peppermint tea: 0-3 times a day

Pau D’Arco: 0-3 times daily 

**Other Considerations/ Thoughts:**
The issue is that the herbs don’t seem to be working well enough, ozone is expensive and seems like it just turns into H2O2 in the body anyway, the rife practitioner’s frequencies didn’t work = waste of time and money, and the prescription medications on the market are not cures.

**Final Notes:**

I do have access to a zapper, but neither machine is a terminator. 

I have an alkaline plant-based diet (arginine=protein): seems to be making it worse, and meat is not an option.

Ive been on a quest to find the best Si/Ge blended pedals, whether a fuzz or an OD, and came across this. Turns out, Zvex made 100 units of the fuzz factory using a Si/Ge blend (50 horizontal cases, 50 vertical). The hybrid takes the standard fuzz factory and replaces one of the transistors with a NOS 1960s 2N404 germanium transistor. So, of course I had to try one! I looove the fuzz factory. In fact, it was one of the first fuzz pedals I ever owned and one of the first times a pedal truly humbled me (I'm still a little scared of it, if I'm honest).

Im convinced the Si/Ge blend is the best combination for any distortion signal design (I've already had a full pot of coffee, so starting spicy this morning!). It just gives you the best of both worlds and lends so much character and depth to any pedal (circuit providing, of course). And this pedal does not fail to deliver!

I'll post a video on the channel at some point, but this thing is WILD. If you're familiar with the Spaceman Effects pedal Drift button...then you will have some idea of the tension this pedal is constantly under -- and that you are constantly fighting (or harnessing). If you love the standard fuzz factory, this is just a wilder, more textured, and harmonically complex version. They seem to be a bit difficult to find, and some people are asking ridiculous prices for them, but I found this one for about $100 less than its retail price. So, I consider that a good deal (\~$200).

If you dont know the fuzz factory well enough already, then the complete lack of graphics or labels will be a bit annoying. Definitely a weird departure for Zvex considering the artwork is such a huge part of their brand. This pedal is definitely a unique one!",2,1765043412.0,guitarpedals,0,1.0,False

The variation in the food was really good, but being gluten free did let stuff get a little monotonous. Also being on a soft food diet for a couple of the days, however, wasn't actually difficult as most of the GF stuff is also on the soft side.

Seriously though, sometimes getting out of bed feels like a full-blown workout in itself. And while a full-blown workout IS awesome… sometimes you just need to *move* without the groans and creaks.

I’ve been experimenting with something lately that’s been a game-changer for my morning stiffness, and I thought I’d share. We believe in strongest people, and the reason is because we are constantly working to keep our strength. So, if you're also struggling with that ""rusty joints"" feeling after 50, I think you will enjoy this free guide: https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts

It's all about getting those joints moving and muscles warmed up in under 10 minutes. Seriously, *under* 10 minutes. Because let’s be real, who has time for anything more before the coffee kicks in? ☕

Here's what I've been doing:

*   **Gentle Neck Rolls:** Clockwise and counter-clockwise. Feels SO good.
*   **Shoulder Shrugs:** Up to your ears, then release. Ten reps. Simple but effective.
*   **Arm Circles:** Small and big. Imagine you're stirring a giant pot of...retirement dreams! (See what I did there? 😉)
*   **Torso Twists:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and gently twist from side to side. Don't force it!
*   **Knee Lifts:** Holding onto a chair if needed. Just get those knees moving.
*   **Ankle Rotations:** Point your toes and rotate your ankles. Feels amazing after a night of being still.

Why does this work?

*   Gets the blood flowing.
*   Lubricates those stiff joints.
*   Wakes up your muscles.
*   And honestly, it just *feels good* to move your body, doesn't it?

The biggest thing I’ve learned is that consistency is key. Even just a few minutes each morning makes a huge difference over time.

What are some of *your* go-to mobility moves in the morning? Any secret weapons against morning stiffness you want to share? Curious to hear what works for everyone else!",1,1765043155.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

My mom, still to this day, loves to “punish me” by storming out of public places if I do or say something that annoys her. If we’re at a clothing store and she senses I’m getting tired or bored (I’m not a shopper like she is), she’ll drop whatever she’s holding, storm out, and I’m left following her like an idiot while she rants and raves.

Today we were getting bagels and coffee. The place was packed, so I suggested we eat in the car instead of waiting for a table. She insisted on squeezing into a corner seat at a table that already had three people at it. We sat down, but I felt weird, so I told her I’d just eat my food when we got back to her place. She immediately shot up from her seat, left her food and coffee, and stormed out to her car. I had to pack up everything, put a lid on her coffee, and hunt her down in the parking lot…only to get berated in the car.

She did this when I was a kid and she still does it now. It’s embarrassing, confusing, and honestly just exhausting at this age.

I guess I’m just curious if anyone else’s parent reacts like this? Or if anyone has had similar experiences? It makes me feel crazy sometimes.",7,1765043088.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,1.0,False

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/s/TUWZu598oF)

The word sat between us like a loaded gun.

“I’m not helping you” I said. My voice sounded weak, even to me. “Whatever you’re doing in that unit? I’m not part of it.”

He smiled. Not wide. Just enough to say he’d been expecting that.

“You already are” he said softly. “You stepped up to the door. You touched the lock. You let yourself be seen. That’s more intimate than anything I’ve done to you.”

I thought of the cut on my cheek. The way he’d appeared out of nowhere.

“You hired yourself the moment you followed me” he went on. “Now I’m just… clarifying your responsibilities.”

He reached into his jacket and slid a folded piece of paper across the table. I didn’t touch it.

“What’s this?”

“A man” he said. “A possibility. Someone I’ve been… considering.”

I forced my hand to move and unfolded the paper.

A name. An address. A grainy photo printed from what looked like a social media profile.

Mid thirties. Plain face. The kind of guy you forget the second you look away.

“Why him?” I asked.

His eyes lit up like a teacher pleased a student had finally asked the right question.

“Because he’s boring” he said. “Boring people are easy to overlook. Easy to move. Easy to shape.”

My stomach turned.

“I’m not doing this.”

“You will” he said calmly.

He tapped the paper with one finger.

“Follow him. Watch him. Learn his habits. Then tell me if he’s a good fit.”

“A good fit for what?” I asked, even though I already knew.

He tilted his head.

“You heard the music. You heard the voice. You heard the humming. I don’t think you need me to draw a picture.”

I swallowed hard.

“What if I tell you he’s not?” I asked. “What if I say he’s wrong for… whatever this is? What if I say no?”

He studied me for a long moment. Not annoyed. Not frustrated.

Curious.

“Then I’ll believe you” he said.

He must have seen it in my face, because his smile twitched.

“Lying is dangerous, Alex” he added. “But honesty? Honesty is binding. If you tell me he’s a bad choice, I will treat him as such.”

His eyes didn’t leave mine when he said it. He wanted me to hear every word.

“You’re the investigator” he finished. “I trust your judgment.”

He stood up, smoothing his jacket like this had all been a regular business meeting.

“Follow him for three days” he said. “Then call me. Not text. Call. I prefer to hear your voice when you decide whether someone gets to keep theirs.”

He turned to leave.

“Why me?” I asked.

He stopped with his hand on the back of the chair.

“Because you already watch people for a living”  he said without looking at me. “All I did was ask you to admit you know who deserves what.”

Then he walked out, leaving the prospect’s name and face staring up at me from the table.


His name was Eric Lawson.

That was the man on the paper. The man in the grainy picture. Retail job. Small house on the edge of town. No wife. No kids. 

Nothing that screamed monster.

Nothing that screamed victim.

Just… a man.

The first night, I sat in my car across from his building, camera in my lap, notebook open on the passenger seat. Old habits took over before my conscience could argue.

I wrote down comings and goings. Who he talked to. How long he stayed out. What time the lights went off. He ordered delivery. Watched something on tv. Fell asleep on the couch. No late night visitors. No drug deals. No violence.

Normal.

Painfully normal.

The second day, I followed him to work.

He managed a mid sized home improvement store. Shifts, schedules, returns, customers with broken things and half finished projects. He smiled at coworkers. Checked on a cashier who looked like she’d been crying. Helped an older man load lumber into his truck.

He wasn’t perfect. Nobody is. I caught him snapping at a teenager who kept checking his phone. I saw him pocket a small item. Nothing big, a box cutter or a tape measure. The kind of small theft that happens a million times a day.

It didn’t feel like the kind of sin that deserved a metal door and humming behind it.

By the third day, I knew one thing for sure.

If I said yes, if I told that man in the coffee shop that Eric “fit” I was picking him up and handing him over.

My decision.

My responsibility.

My guilt.

I couldn’t do it.

So I built myself a way out.



I stayed up late drafting the report.

Not the one I’d give a normal client, a cheating spouse case, an insurance dispute. Those reports stick to facts. Dates, times, places, photos. Things that hold up in court.

This one?

This one was theater.

I listed connections he didn’t have.

“Subject appears to maintain regular contact with his sister, a nurse” I typed. “Brother in law is a patrol officer with the police department. Subject’s mother lives twenty minutes away and visits weekly.”

None of that was true.

He had no siblings. His parents lived three states away and had left a single comment on a birthday post two years ago.

I added more.

“House is equipped with multiple security cameras” I wrote. “Ring doorbells on neighboring houses. Subject’s employer is part of a larger corporate chain with strict HR protocols and internal review policies. Subject is well liked by coworkers and known by name by regular customers.”

I upscaled everything that could make him visible, connected, risky.

The kind of man people noticed.

The kind of man people would miss.

At the bottom, I wrote the sentence I hoped would end this.

ASSESSMENT: Subject is NOT a viable prospect. High visibility. Multiple personal and professional connections. Increased risk of investigation if he disappears. Recommend abandoning subject and seeking alternative candidate.

I read it twice.

If I did nothing, Eric was exposed.

If I told the truth, he was exposed.

This felt like the only option left that wasn’t a direct death sentence.

I hit send.

My email client told me it was delivered.

I shut the laptop and sat in the dark for a long time.

You lied, a small voice in the back of my mind whispered.

I told it to shut up.

I went to bed and didn’t sleep.



He called me the next afternoon.

No unknown number this time. Just the same calm voice that had hummed in the storage unit and turned my blood to ice.

“Good afternoon, Alex.”

I swallowed.

“Did you read it?” I asked.

“I did” he said. “It was… thorough.”

There was something in his tone I couldn’t place. Not approval. Not anger.

Something worse.

“Meet me” he said. “Same place.”

The coffee shop.

My grip tightened on the phone.

“I already told you.”

“You lied” he said quietly. “I think that deserves a face to face, don’t you?”

The line clicked dead.

For a moment, I considered not going. Turning my phone off. Driving somewhere far away and never looking back.

But wherever I went, my license, my plates, my address, the folder he’d shown me, it would still exist. The cut on my cheek would still sting. The humming would still burrow through my brain.

And Eric Lawson would still be out there, sitting in his house, having no idea that a stranger had written a story about him that might decide whether he woke up tomorrow.

I went.



The coffee shop looked exactly the same.

He wasn’t inside.

For a half second, hope sparked. Maybe he’d been bluffing. Maybe he hadn’t read the report. Maybe…

My phone buzzed.

Unknown:
Outside.

I turned.

He stood beside a dark sedan in the parking lot, one hand resting on the roof, the other in his coat pocket. He might as well have been waiting for a valet ticket.

I walked over.

“Afternoon” he said pleasantly. “You look tired.”

“You read the report” I said.

The corner of his mouth twitched.

“I did.”

He nodded toward the car.

“Walk with me.”

Every instinct I had screamed to turn around. To leave. To make a scene, shout for help, force witnesses into this.

But my feet moved anyway.

He led me to the back of the car and stopped, fingers brushing the trunk.

“Before we talk about your creative writing” he said, “I want to show you something.”

He pressed the button. The trunk clicked and eased open an inch. He lifted it the rest of the way.

Eric Lawson was inside.

Duct tape over his mouth. Zip ties around his wrists and ankles. Eyes red and swollen. He was breathing fast. Sweat slicked his hair to his forehead.

He saw me.

And for a second, hope flared in his eyes.

It died when he saw the other man standing beside me.

A muffled sound escaped him. 

My knees went weak.

“What did you do?” I whispered.

The man beside me didn’t look at Eric.

He looked at me.

“You said he had family close by” he said calmly. “You said his brother in law was law enforcement. That he was known. Visible. Remember?”

I couldn’t make my mouth move.

“He has no siblings” the man continued. “His parents are old and far away and tired. He lives alone. No roommates. No one who texts him when he’s late. No one who notices when he closes early and doesn’t reopen.”

“You sent me fiction” he said. “And I don’t like fiction.”

My hand shook against my side.

“You knew” I managed. “You knew all that before you gave him to me.”

“Of course I did” he said. “I don’t outsource the important parts.”

“Then why”

“Because I wanted to see what you’d do” he said, voice lowering slightly. “Whether you’d tell the truth and let me decide… or whether you’d lie and try to keep your conscience clean.”

He finally glanced down at Eric, who had started to sob behind the tape, shoulders shaking.

“Unfortunately” he said, “your lie didn’t protect him.”

My throat closed.

“You don’t have to do this” I said hoarsely. “Just let him go. He doesn’t know anything. He hasn’t seen anything. He’s just…”

“Unusable” the man interrupted softly.

The word hit harder than a slap.

“What?”

“Prospects have to be clean” he said. “Untouched. You looked at him. You judged him. You changed him. He was going to be something. Now he’s just… a ruined ingredient.”

He closed the trunk gently.

“What are you going to do to him?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly.

“You lied, Alex” he said. “I’m already correcting for that. I don’t think you want the details.”

“You said if I told you he was a bad choice, you’d treat him as such” I said. My voice sounded distant, like it belonged to someone else.

“I am” he said. “He’s useless now.”

“Don’t be sentimental,” he said quietly. “You tried to play a game. You lost. That’s all this is.”

“That’s a person” I snapped, louder than I meant to. “That’s a man who’s never done anything to you.”

His eyes flicked to my bandaged cheek, then back.

“He has now” he said. “He let you near him.”

He watched me wrestle with it. Watched the guilt sink its teeth into me and shake.

Then he smiled.

Not pleased. Not cruel.

Satisfied.

“Now” he said, “you understand what a lie costs.”

I stared at the closed trunk.

“You could have done this without me” I whispered.

“I could have” he agreed. “But then you wouldn’t feel it.”


“What do you want from me?” I asked. I hated how small I sounded.

“For you to stop pretending you’re neutral” he said. “You spend your life deciding who is right and who is wrong and who deserves to have their secrets exposed. All I’m asking you to do is admit it.”

He reached into his coat again and pulled out another piece of paper. This one was blank except for a single line printed at the top.

CANDIDATE:

He handed me a pen.

“Find someone who deserves it” he said. “You owe me one.”

“I’m not.”

“You lied,” he repeated. “Because you wanted to save yourself from choosing. That cowardice cost him.”

He nodded at the trunk.

“If you lie again, someone else pays” he said. “If you pick thoughtlessly, someone pays. The only way you walk away from this with even a sliver of your conscience intact is if you do what you already do every day.”

He leaned in close.

“Investigate” he whispered. “Judge. Choose.”

He stepped back.

“I don’t need you to like it” he added. “I just need you to be good at it.”

He walked around to the driver’s side door.

“Please” I said. I wasn’t even sure who I was begging for anymore.

He paused.

“You asked me what I’d do to him” he said, not looking back. “Here’s your answer.”

He opened the door.

“I’ll do whatever you think I did.”

He got in, started the engine, and drove away, trunk still closed, leaving me standing in the parking lot with a blank form in my hand and a pit in my stomach.

**TENINO, WA** – Thurston County Commissioner Wayne Fournier, firefighter, and lifelong community advocate, unveiled a comprehensive policy proposal this week intended to address income inequality without resorting to the “structural flaws” of a conventional Workers Bill of Rights.

The policy, formally dubbed the “Workers’ Opportunity Realignment & Key Performance Act” (WORK Act), argues that the region’s lower wages are not a failure of the labor market, but a failure of personal scheduling optimization. The solution, according to Fournier, is not minimum wage hikes or rigid scheduling mandates, but for lowincome residents to simply acquire a second, or even third, job.

""For far too long, business owners and conservatives have told the poor to 'get a damn job,'"" Fournier said. ""As a Democrat and union member, I am moving beyond such devisive langugage. I am saying ""Get a damn second job! Get a damn THIRD job! This is an abudance policy, not cold-heartedness.""

**The Failure of “Policy Shortcutism”**

Commissioner Fournier, known for his pragmatic, “bootsstrapontheground” approach to governance, framed the WORK Act as a mature response to the defeat of recent progressive measures.

“The failure of the ‘Workers Bill of Rights’ approach wasn’t about a lack of compassion for workers; it was about policy literacy,” Fournier stated during a press conference held outside a local coffee shop, where he also reportedly picked up a 2-hour barista shift. “We need to move past slogans and shortcuts. The structural flaw of the Workers Bill of Rights is its refusal to engage with the reality that the worker has only scheduled for one income stream.”

Fournier’s proposal leverages proprietary “Olympia-specific modeling,” which he claims proves that any resident working under 80 hours per week is suffering from “critical underutilization.”

When asked by an activist why he, a cardcarrying union firefighter, would oppose basic union-backed solutions like raising the minimum wage, Fournier paused only to tighten the strap of his commissioner-branded utility belt.

“Look, I’m a union guy, absolutely,” he clarified. “But you have to understand the purpose of a union. When I’m on the clock as a firefighter, the union is there to make sure someone is ready to save me if I’m trapped in a dangerous, high-risk work environment. The union’s job is to protect its member’s life and livlihoods. It’s not some kind of co-op where we decide what the price of labor is for other people who choose to work in safe, lowrisk industries like retail or food service.""

**Focus on ‘Policy Design,’ Not ‘Pitting People Against People’**

Fournier emphasized that his policy avoids the common pitfall of “pitting workers against owners” by focusing squarely on the individual worker’s time management capacity.

“Prop 1 failed because it was drafted elsewhere and dropped into our local ecosystem,” Fournier asserted. “The WORK Act, by contrast, is informed by my personal, lived experience of juggling county commission work with a second career as a firefighter. This is Olympia-specific reality. We can and must do better than slogans. The real slogan is: ‘If you have downtime, you have dollars.’”

When asked by a reporter how someone working two fulltime minimum wage jobs would manage basic life tasks, Fournier simply looked at his watch, muttered, “Multitasking, folks. It’s all in the multitasking and not sleeping,” and sprinted off to what was confirmed to be his weekly shift as a weekend UHaul rental attendant.",3,1765042374.0,olympia,9,0.57,False

Ever feel like your body's been holding you hostage behind that desk? I know I did! Years of spreadsheets, back-to-back meetings, and questionable office coffee...it takes a toll. So, after finally hitting that sweet, sweet retirement date, I was expecting some relief, sure. But WOW, the actual results were wilder than I imagined.

Seriously, it's like my body threw a silent (and very grateful) party the moment I handed in my badge.

Here are just *three* unexpected ways my body decided to say ""THANK YOU"" after I ditched the desk:

*   **Goodbye, Tension Headaches (Seriously, Bye Felicia!)**: Remember those headaches that would creep up mid-afternoon, fueled by stress and fluorescent lights? Gone. Vanished. Poof! Turns out, not being constantly worried about deadlines and demanding bosses does wonders for your head. Who knew? I literally feel lighter!

*   **Sleep? What a Concept!**: I always thought I was just ""not a good sleeper."" Turns out, my body was in constant fight-or-flight mode thanks to the daily grind. Now? I'm sleeping like a baby...a baby who's also a bear hibernating for the winter. And the best part? No more hitting snooze 17 times!

*   **My Joints Suddenly Remembered How to Bend**: Okay, maybe not *suddenly*. But after years of being hunched over a keyboard, my back and shoulders were NOT happy campers. Now, with more time for walks, gardening (attempted gardening, anyway!), and just generally *moving*, I'm feeling more flexible than I have in decades. I swear I almost touched my toes the other day! Almost.

Look, I'm not saying retirement is a magic cure-all. But it *is* giving my body a chance to heal and recharge in ways I never thought possible. It's like I'm finally giving my physical well-being the attention it deserves. Remember, **we believe in strongest people.** If you want to explore products that could give you a head-start on the retirement relaxation and health front, check out what I found helpful here: [https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb).

So, are you experiencing any unexpected benefits since retiring? What surprised you the most? Or, if you’re still dreaming of that day, what are you most looking forward to your body thanking you for? Let's hear it!

Four months ago I had a strange heart rhythm/irregular episode that lasted about 2 minutes. At that time I was using a lot of tobacco and drinking a lot of coffee. Since that day, I’ve been experiencing PACs, mostly in the morning when I wake up.

I sometimes worry that the episode I had might have been AFib, and that I should prepare myself as if I’m an AFib patient — because that feels like the most logical explanation to me. But I’m not sure if that’s actually realistic or if I’m overthinking it.

I recently had a 72-hour Holter and it showed only 0.01% PACs, with no documented AFib. My average heart rate was around 67 bpm.

Still, the fact that I had that “out of rhythm” moment and then PACs afterward keeps me anxious.

Has anyone experienced something similar?
Could that short 2-minute episode have been AFib, or is it more likely that tobacco + caffeine caused a temporary rhythm disturbance and now my system is just sensitive?

FIrst off I am a old school gamer that grew up, on playstation, nentendo, super nentendo and Sega genesis as well as 3DO.

Now, when I buy a game I only care for the game play story mode or campaign, the multiplayer or co-op don't really care for one good reason.

you cant win against cheaters and its pointless wasting your time trying to fight these types of lobby lounge lizards tech cheaters....

now claps hands... got to eat my scone and take a sip of my coffee and water, where was I, Ahhh!

the Co-op and Multiplayer that everyone buys games for... sigh. well Good for you! Enjoy it in all of its wasteful time and glory...

me personally, I learned that Co-op and multiplayer on all games a waste. why?

you cant win and you cant get your kills for a youtube series, tiktok series or twitch series, unless you cheat.

and I am Not going to be their guinea pig for their Social Platforms for kill ratios...in their recordings...

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1pfusxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/1pfusxg/question_on_casting_agents_for_international/,question on casting agents for international beginners/actors,"Hello! So i've read all the FAQs and rules... I'm from Singapore, and the international casting net rarely ever reaches here. Not to mention, nobody really has a chance in the local acting industry to move on to US/UK based works. Unfortunately, our local works are the equivalent of college projects in the US, and it is treated as such due to the lack of budget.  
  
I've spent the past two hours reading through posts in here and came across lots of mentions that it is hard to impossible to even get a US/UK agent especially if you have one to nil on your portfolio. Obviously no one will go out of their way to produce a visa for a 'nobody' when there are tons of 'somebodies' out there. It then goes back to the o1 visa eligibility, and after mentioning how our local industry is the equivalent to college projects... I feel as though I have no hope. I was in the drama club for a year or two when i was in high school - backstage, didn't play much of a part in anything asides from lighting. I have tried to get into acting once when I was 15, even locally, but there weren't any viable options so i just redirected my focus back to working in the business sect. Now, I'm slightly olde and, I still do feel as though this is something that I truly have passion in. If I leave this world, the only regret I may have is if I don't fight for a role lol.  
  
We don't have drama schools where I am either. There is are two art schools here but I do not qualify for either due to my avg grades. Short exp: our ministry of edu requires students to be the top few to be eligible for entry. I have looked at backstage, casting network and actors access too, but most works are based outside of my country. International open casting calls are also less than likely to look at me, not that i haven't tried. I even went as far as to search through office buildings for an agency once only to find they have no acting rep in this country, only a sports rep. I feel lost and hopeless.  
  
At best, i can throw a spaghetti at the wall as mentioned in the FAQ and email tons of agents with eye catching headlines in hopes my email is good enough for a cup of coffee and five minutes of their time. As I'm in SG, I can only hope to catch an agent with, ""If you're in so and so, I hope to catch five minutes of your time over coffee."" Even that sounds like a far cry to reach. I apologise if this was a long read. Also apologise if this specifically is something that has already been discussed prior and i've somehow missed the post. Please feel free to ask for any clarifications. Does anyone have any advice for this specifically or is the spaghetti idea all i have? ",1,1765042189.0,acting,3,1.0,False

An optional nut-free batch for my Jackie!)

I developed this recipe when I had a jar of apple butter I didn’t know what to do with. These cookies are warm, cozy, and full of fall comfort. These thumbprints are nutty, brown-butter shortbread, thickened apple butter, and a warm drizzle of caramel. The kind of cookie that holds you close for a moment before you Ramble On again.

**Equipment**

Saucepans  
Mixing bowls  
Wooden spoon  
Rubber spatula  
Whisk  
Plastic wrap  
Baking sheet  
Parchment paper  
A small spoon or your thumb  
Cooling rack  
Plastic baggie (for crushing nuts)  
Optional sharp knife  
Measuring cups and spoons

**Ingredients**

All-purpose (AP) flour Unsalted butter  
Granulated sugar  
Salt  
Ground cinnamon Vanilla extract (pure is optimal)  
Apple butter  
Lemon (for zesting)  
Caramel sauce (homemade or store-bought, recipe below)

Chopped toasted walnuts (optional) Roasted, salted peanuts (optional)

Apple Brandy (optional)

**Method**

**Brown the Butter**

Melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Swirl as it foams, watch for tiny brown speckles. Remove from heat when the butter smells nutty and looks golden. Do not strain out the brown-butter solids, that’s where the flavor is. Let cool 1–2 minutes until the sizzling softens, then sprinkle in the 1/4 tsp cinnamon and let it bloom 30-60 seconds, stirring continuously.

Cool completely until opaque and spreadable. Then, whisk in the vanilla.

**Make Shortbread Dough**

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (270g) 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter (226g)  
1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g)  
1/2 teaspoon salt  
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5ml)  
1/2 cup (55g) very finely chopped toasted walnuts (optional)

In a bowl, measure out the flour and salt, whisk together to combine, and set aside.

In a mixing bowl, add the cooled brown-butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 cup sugar. Whip gently until combined.

Then, add the flour/salt and gently mix until just combined.

Fold in 1/2 cup walnuts, if using.

Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently combine with your hands until it just comes together. A little crumbly is fine; don't overwork the dough.

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator overnight (ideal) or at least 2 hours. The dough can keep 3–4 days refrigerated.  
You can freeze unbaked dough for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before shaping.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm for 10 minutes before shaping.

**Apple Butter Filling**

3/4 cup apple butter (120-180g)  
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest  
Apple Brandy (optional)

Simmer the apple butter 5–10 minutes until thick and glossy. Remove from heat and gently stir in the lemon zest. Cool completely, 30-45 minutes.

Then add 1/2-1 tsp apple brandy, if using (to taste).

**Note**

For the half-boozy, half non-boozy divide cooled apple butter, and add 1/4-1/2 tsp of brandy (to taste). Reduce apple butter until thick; best used the same day.  
Warm filling causes spreading during baking.  
Lemon zest is ideal; lemon juice should be used sparingly.

**Bake**

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) before shaping the cookies. Grease or spray mini muffin pan for easy release.

Scoop 2 Tbsp of dough per muffin cup and press down and around the edges to form a cup. Chill 15–20 minutes. Re-press indentations if needed. Fill each indentation with about 1 teaspoon thickened apple butter; do not overfill, just a bit under the rim. Leave room for drizzle and peanuts.

Place the pan in a pre-heated oven for 13–16 minutes until pale but set. You are not looking for golden brown.

Cool 5 minutes on the sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely 30-60 minutes.

**Finish**

Drizzle the caramel over the cooled cookies.

Top with very finely chopped salted roasted peanuts.

When using roasted peanuts, Less Is More. Use about 1/8 teaspoon per cookie. Too many peanuts will overwhelm the brown-butter and apple-butter flavors.

**Storage**

Cookies should be unfinished (no drizzle or nuts) for freezing. Room temperature (on the counter) 3–4 days in an air-tight container or baggie. Freeze 3 months (optimal), can freeze up to 6 months. Do not refrigerate baked cookies. It will dry them out and make them stale faster.

**Homemade Salted Caramel**

Ingredients

1 cup granulated sugar (200g)  
6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces (85g)  
1/2 cup heavy cream, warmed slightly (120ml)  
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (5ml)  
1/4 tsp salt

**Method**

Add the sugar to a dry saucepan over medium heat. Let the edges melt, then swirl or stir until fully melted and deep amber. Any clumps will melt as it cooks.

Whisk in the butter carefully; it will bubble.

Slowly pour in the warm cream while whisking continuously to prevent clumping and remove from heat. Gently stir in the vanilla and 1/8 tsp of salt.

Let cool for 5–10 minutes before using.

**Storage**

Refrigerate up to 2 weeks. If too thick, microwave in 10–15 second bursts to loosen.

Delicious in coffee, over ice cream, on apple slices, with brownies, in hot chocolate, or drizzled on pancakes.

**Notes**

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

Things were heating up fast, but I needed a moment to collect myself. I excused myself and headed to the restroom to straighten out my hoodie and catch my breath.

As I was staring at myself in the mirror, someone gently tapped my shoulder and said, “Hey… aren’t you \[Your friend’s name\]’s friend?”

It was a woman I didn’t expect to see—one of my friend’s closest college buddies. Her eyes lit up when she recognized me, and with a soft smile, she said, “Come with me.”

I followed her quietly, heart still racing from what I’d just left behind. She led me to a quiet, tucked-away corner of the coffee shop—silky couches, free drinks, a power outlet nearby—and suddenly I was upgraded to a little sanctuary of comfort and peace.

While I was soaking it all in, the man next to me caught my eye. Someone referred to him as the founder of a tech startup. His energy was magnetic—calm, confident, and kind.

He asked what I was working on. I told him about my projects and how desperately I’d been looking for an internship to get my career started.

Without hesitation, he said, “Send me your resume.”

I thought it was just polite banter. But no—he opened his laptop right there and started reading it intently.

Minutes later, he closed the laptop and looked up at me with a sincere smile. “I want to offer you an internship. Here’s my contact and the office address.”

Just then, the woman who’d guided me there returned. We started talking, and in that quiet corner, something unexpected happened—a spark I didn’t want to ignore. Her laugh was genuine, her eyes warm. We found ourselves effortlessly sharing stories and dreams over endless cups of coffee.

A few days later, the founder called me with the final surprise—he was gifting me a car for my commute, making the internship offer even sweeter.

So there I was—job in my right hand, a new girlfriend in my left, and a car waiting outside as if this crazy twist of fate was building a new life for me.

1pfulu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pfulu2/need_help_dialing_in_new_coffees_without_wasting/,Need help dialing in new coffees without wasting beans,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice.

Whenever I buy new coffees (usually 3 to 4 bags at once), I end up wasting a lot of beans just trying to dial them in. Every coffee behaves differently in terms of grind size, solubility, resting time, and processing method.

I usually brew a different bag every morning and rotate through them (Coffee #1 on Day 1, Coffee #2 on Day 2, Coffee #3 on Day 3, etc.). Mid-day I usually brew a decaf.
The problem is that when all the coffees are different origins and processes (washed, natural, anaerobic, etc.), each one requires a totally different grind setting.

For context:
	•	Hario V60 with hario filter
	•	Fellow Ode Gen 2
	•	Mostly light roasts (Friedhats, Gardelli, etc.)
       •	James Hoffmann’s 5-pours recipe (100°C)
	•	My brewing water:
	•	Ca: 21
	•	Mg: 6
	•	Na: 5
	•	Bicarbonate: 18
	•	Chloride: 40
	•	Sulphate: 25
	•	Iron: 0.2
	•	Total hardness: 75
	•	pH: 7.5
	•	TDS: 105

Here’s the issue:
Every time I start a new bag, I end up doing multiple grind adjustments just to get the first drinkable cup. Sometimes the coffee needs a much finer grind, other times much coarser, and I can’t really predict it. I feel like I’m spending more time chasing the dial-in than actually enjoying the coffee.

My question:
How do you dial in new coffees without wasting 30–50 g every time?
Is there a systematic approach or starting framework to get close on the first or second brew especially when rotating through multiple new coffees ?

Would really appreciate any workflows, rules of thumb, or methods that make dialing in more efficient",1,1765041696.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

1pfuj3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1pfuj3m/finally_quitting_after_a_year_of_excruciating/,Finally quitting after a year of excruciating knee pain,"So I started Wellbutrin around a year ago to deal with some minor depression and malaise.  Had some early success with it; felt a little better, more motivation, etc. 

Around 2 months into it I started developing huge issues with pain in both my knees, first the left, then the right. Didn’t make any connection to my medication. Finally after months of dealing with it, I went to an orthopedist. After many tests they decide to go in and clean up my meniscus. Great. Minor surgery. Back to work in a couple weeks. 

Surgery felt like a success but after only about a month my right knee starts doing the same thing. Now I’m a painter by trade and I beat the living shit out of knees for 48 years so some of this is to expected. 

So same thing with right knee, minor surgery, clean up meniscus again, back to work. That was 2 and a half months ago. While recovering from right knee surgery the left knee starts to act up again. 

Long story short, the past month has been unbearable. The pain in my knees is at a 9.5. Finally Tuesday I had to stay home from work. While off I started researching if something else in my life could be causing issues. I had already eliminated alcohol, coffee, dairy, reduced sugar and carb intake, got a stretching band, started therapy at the gym, drank mushroom coffee and turmeric teas and nothing helped. Advil and Aleve couldn’t touch the pain. 

Then I stumble upon a Reddit thread about the side effect of Wellbutrin on joints, especially for people with underlying conditions and it dawned on me that the knee pain started shortly after being placed on these meds. 

I have since stopped taking my meds about 4 days ago and my pain has reduced by about 40%. I spoke to my ortho and he hadn’t heard of this being an issue. 

Sorry for the long post but I have lost over a year of my life because of this issue and just wanted to let others know of this possibility. ",1,1765041513.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

I've always loved mermaids.

Yes, I was one of those kids obsessed with everything mermaid whether that was TV shows, movies, books.

Any marine-related media, really, but mermaids especially.

I loved everything about the sea, about water, until I almost drowned on my fifth birthday. So, with a newfound fear of even dipping my toes in the shallows, I became fascinated with fake water instead. 

Mom called it a mental illness. (I can see where she was coming from, considering I asked for every pool or water-related game ever made.) But I was just a kid.

I preferred water to land, and even terrified of it, I still wanted to submerge myself in it, imagining a whole other world. 

I barely remember almost drowning, only the contorting fear twisting inside me and swallowing me up, the inability to speak, my voice cruelly torn away, my breath stolen as I sank further into the abyss—also known as the deep end of our neighbor’s pool. 

Mom said I didn’t realize it was that deep since I was used to our own pool. 

So there I was, sitting on the edge with my legs swinging and a plate of birthday cake in my hands, when I had the bright idea to show the adults how cute I was. 

This is my mom’s retelling, so it's probably exaggerated, but apparently, I dropped headfirst into the pool, cake and all, and sank straight to the bottom. 

Dad dove in after me, pulling me back to the surface, dragging me from the shallows. 

But it was too late.

I was screaming, hysterical, backing away from the pool like it was filled with lava. The crazy thing is, I remember this exact feeling. I remember staggering back, the ice-cold breeze tickling my cheeks feeling wrong compared to the warmth of the water that was supposed to protect me. 

The ice cold concrete of my neighbor’s patio felt *wrong*. 

Land felt wrong. 

The water, that had almost killed me, felt *right*, and I could never understand why. 

Instead of caressing me, this cruel underwater world had dragged me down, down, down, squeezing my lungs and stealing my air, crushing instead of cradling me. I avoided water and didn’t go near any pool after that, even ours; the very one I used to spend every spare hour splashing around in. 

When Mom tried to bathe me, I insisted on the water being ankle-deep, with her using a cup to rinse my hair as I tilted my head back, squeezing my eyes shut... 

According to Mom, I would scream until my throat was raw if there was too much water. 

Even washing my hands and brushing my teeth, I remember timing the flow just right, so I could stick my toothbrush or soapy hands under, count three elephants, and then dive out of the bathroom. 

I flooded the floors on multiple occasions when I forgot to turn off the faucet. 

But still, somehow, I was fascinated with water itself. I loved how it was still, how it ran and trickled and filled my cupped hands…. 

According to Mom, I told my therapist I wanted to be a fish.

However, my therapist had a sort of resolution. She leaned forward and grabbed my hands, squeezing them tight. 

*“Okay, Sadie, well, if you're scared of real water, why don’t you try fake water?”*

Which, I guess, is how my mermaid obsession started.

My therapist started me with little kids’ games about solving puzzles underwaterand immediately, I was hooked. 

Through my fascination with digital water, I found mermaids, beautiful, human-like fish people who could breathe underwater, living in vast, towering cities deep, deep under the sea. 

I watched every Little Mermaid, bingeing mermaid-themed movies and TV shows. 

By the age of nine, I was fully convinced I was actually a mermaid, and touching water would magically transform my legs into a tail.

It didn’t, obviously, so I did what any supposedly mentally ill nine-year-old would do. I swallowed two teaspoons of salt mixed with tears of terror before sticking my head underwater for ten seconds.

Again, nothing happened.

But I was starting to slowly overcome my fear of being submerged in water, so I lowered myself onto the stairs in the shallow end of our pool and forced myself to get used to it.

I was still acclimating when my brother shoved my head under, quickly reminding me of that sensation, the squeezing of my chest, the inability to breathe, choking on bubbles exploding around me. After that, Dad insisted on teaching me how to swim. 

Like me, he’d always been fascinated with water, so he refused to have a child who couldn’t swim. Before my older brother and I were even born, he enrolled us in lessons. Harvey was five years older than me, so he could already swim. 

Dad wanted to take me to the sea, though I was more comfortable in the pool.

However, my swimming classes were short-lived (I barely learned how to keep my head afloat) when Dad left in the middle of the night and never came back. But… neither did my brother.

I woke up around midnight to Mom hysterically crying. I discovered the next morning that Dad had taken my brother hookah diving without proper equipment, and Harvey was in the emergency room. 

Initially, I was told my brother was very sick, which, obviously, I believed. 

I was playing Sonic with my brother only yesterday! In my head, he was just sick in the hospital.

I spent the day expecting him to drag himself into my bedroom at any time, knock something over, call me a name, and run away. But the house was empty. 

Mom didn't come out of her room. 

Not even to take me to school. Instead, I watched Cartoon Network all day. I poked my head in my brother’s room, and it was a noticeable mess, clothes strewn everywhere and a half-packed suitcase.

When I asked to see Harvey a few days later, Mom told me he was dead.

Brain-dead, at least.

She explained it the best she could, choking on her own words.

Harvey had gone too deep, and when trying to resurface, his blood had bubbles and his brain had popped.

I don’t think she was mentally okay enough to explain to her nine-year-old daughter that her brother was dead... 

Yeah, no, considering she used our soda stream and a grape to demonstrate the accident with a hysterical smile on her mouth, almost like she thought it was funny. I didn't find it funny. 

Watching the bubbles in the water and my mother pop a grape between her index and thumb with a huge grin on her face was actually fucking traumatising. 

I know people grieve in their own way. Even as a kid though, I was confused when my brother didn’t get a funeral. 

Dad did come back, but only to try and justify his trip with Harvey. He said it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that he was just doing what was best for his kids.

I already despised him for taking my brother away, but the way he talked about him, insisting that “Harvey loves the water!” made me want to scream. 

He was *wrong.* While I was obsessed with water, my brother had steered away from it, especially the sea. Mom called him a psycho and threw him out. Dad moved to the other side of town, and it was just Mom and me once again.

For a long time, I hated my father. I ignored his letters, calls, texts, and the mermaid figurines he sent me for my birthday. I didn’t understand grieving, and worse, post-grieving. Did such a thing exist? I understood that I was sad, and sometimes I was happy—before feeling guilty for catching myself smiling. 

I missed him, so I got a diary. I wrote to my brother, telling him everything and nothing, sometimes just what I did that day, or telling him how mom was.

I started attending group therapy. One girl said she forgave her father for killing her mother in a car crash but her words became entangled in my mind, frustrating me, bleeding into confusion and anger I couldn't control.

How could she forgive something like that? I asked her after, and she shrugged and said, “It wasn't his fault.” 

“But it *was* my dad’s fault,” I told her, leaning forward in my chair. “He killed my brother.”

The girl, Mia, I think her name was (I could never read her name-tag– it was either Mia, or Mira) folded her arms, shooting me a glare. “Well, maybe you should forgive him.”

When I asked Mom in the car on the way home, she said the exact same thing. 

“It was an accident, Sadie,” Mom said. “Your father took your brother diving, and he wasn't ready.” She averted her gaze, her hands tightening around the wheel. “Harvey asked him to take him out during a storm.”

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. “But you said—”

She said Harvey didn't want to go diving.

There wasn't a storm that night. I would have heard it.

She said my brother hated the ocean, and he wanted no part of it.

Mom’s eyes darkened, and she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, before changing the subject, flicking on the radio. “Do you want to get takeout tonight?”

I wanted to question her, but I didn't even know what to ask.

But then I was questioning my own memories.

Did Mom say what I remembered, or did I mishear her?

It took me a long time to realize maybe Harvey's death wasn't Dad’s fault after all.

After a while of therapy, and listening to other kids’ stories, I started to wonder if hating him was the right thing to do. 

Mom was talking to him civilly, at least. The two of them met for coffee every Saturday, and Mom seemed like she had genuinely forgiven him. 

The other kids asked me if my Mom was *over* Harvey’s death. But I guess laughing was inappropriate. “Grieving is an individual emotion!” Mr. Prescott, our therapist, kept saying, when I was on my knees giggling into the prickly carpet. 

Was my mother over my brother’s death? *Yes, of course she was!* 

That's what I told my friends, who I made sure stayed far away from our house. 

Mom was *fine*, I told everyone. 

She was completely fine, and definitely *not* slowly losing her mind, insisting on buying a giant aquarium for her room and named her new pet flounder fish Harvey. 

*Mom isn't crazy*, I told myself, which became my mantra. 

She just had her own way of grieving. 

Besides, I did like Harvey. 

He was pretty cool for a fish, always waiting for me behind the glass when I got home from school. 

*Mom isn't crazy.*

That's what I told myself (again) when I caught her opening the tank and trying to fish Harvey out of the water to hold him. Unlike other fish though, he didn't freak out or squirm, instead staying cupped in her hands. 

So, no, I finally admitted to my therapy class, bursting into tears..

Mom definitely wasn't over my brother. I was eleven years old, and my mother was on the brink of a breakdown. 

She worked all day every day, and on weekends all she talked about was either work, or Harvey the fish, often pausing so *he* could join in conversations.

Sometimes, she asked him, “How's school?” 

I had to quietly remind her that the fish wasn't actually my brother. 

I needed something– someone– normal. 

I found ‘normal’ in the family pool, enveloping myself in my comfort zone. 

Over the years, I taught myself how to swim, envisioning my tail again. 

In my mind, I could swim away from my family, and never go back. 

Unfortunately, I was old enough to know mermaids weren't real.

The only connection I *did* have with the ocean was with Harvey.

Dad called every day inviting me to visit. 

I always declined. I wasn't interested in his shiny new life. Dad was an architect, and had designed his own house by the sea. 

I ignored him until my twelfth birthday, when he sent a text which just said, “Happy Birthday, pumpkin! I have a surprise for you, but you're going to have to come see it yourself. Our door is always open, Sadie. You're going to love them!”

I wasn't exactly ecstatic. Dad’s new girlfriend, who was half his age, smelled like red tide when she came to visit, and I wasn't looking forward to the awkward conversation I would be having with my father. If I'm honest, though, part of me was intrigued by the photos Mom showed me. 

So, ignoring my therapist, who said, “Just give it a little more time,” I rode my bike to his beach house after school.

Dad’s place teetered on the sea, designed to blend with the ocean itself. 

On the edge of a cliff, with grandiose pillars (which were way too much), lay my father’s house, cut off from the rest of the town, and definitely showing off his wealth. I wasn't expecting it to be so modern. French doors leading me inside sported beta fish carvings, an axolotl in a fifty gallon tank greeting me with its trademark smile. I was hesitant at first. 

If I fully walked inside, I wouldn't be able to leave without having a painful conversation with my father.  But running away seemed childish—even for a soon to be twelve year old. I admit, I was impressed. 

If *these* were the lengths he'd gone to get my attention, well, he had me hook, line, and sinker. Dad had designed his house to resemble an aquarium. 

The hallway was illuminated with a soft blue light, every wall a different tank filled with a variety of fish. It was almost like being in real-life Animal Crossing. 

Farther down, glass floors mimicked the deep ocean, filled with tiny flounder swimming below.

I've always been afraid of heights, so stepping on flooring resembling the deep ocean, twisted my gut, and yet filled me with exhilaration. Like stepping across an underwater world. It was both beautiful, and *way* over the top. But that was Dad’s mo. 

We always had to have the *best* pool when I was a kid. 

“Sadie?” Dad’s voice startled me when I was staring, transfixed by everything around me. I didn't know what to look at first. Everything was *water* themed. 

Even the stairs. It was pretty, sure, but it didn't look *lived* in. The walls were filled with fish, a beautiful display of marine life showcased on every corner. I found myself pressed up against schools of nemo fish spiralling in scarlet streams, stealing away my breath. Beautiful. 

But there was nothing that made this house a home– stained coffee cups and magazines strewn all over the floor. 

That was Mom’s house. 

Dad’s was more like a museum. 

I was intrigued by the kitchen lit up in a bioluminescent glow, slowly inching towards it, when Dad’s voice came again.

This time, from underneath me. “I'm in the basement, sweetie!”

I had half a mind to run. It hit me that I didn't want to see my father, I just wanted to see my surprise. The teenage brain is selfish, but I had my reasons. 

Still, though, I found myself attracted to the basement, my sneakers making smacking noises on the steps. 

Unlike upstairs, the lower levels of Dad’s house were yet to be renovated. Thinking of the death star, there was no stair rail. 

My hands grazed cold brick walls, before darkness became ocean blue, like walking on the seafloor. 

The low hum of a filtration system cut through the silence, my steps quickening. 

The basement was not what I was expecting; a simple room with one singular tank. The stink of seawater and bleach drowned my nose and throat, both clinical and otherworldly, forcing my legs further. 

Dad stood in front, grinning beneath a banner saying, “Happy 12th birthday!”

I was already taking steps forward, my body in control of my mind. 

The tank was darker than the others, tiny green lights at the bottom illuminating clear water. 

I could barely register Dad’s words, my gaze glued to the glass..

His voice sounded like ocean waves crashing against the shore, wading in and out of my ears. “I asked my friends for a favour,” he said. “They specialise in marine research, and…well, during their last expedition, they found something incredible, Sadie.” Dad’s grin was contagious, and in three strides, I was pressing my face against the glass. 

I don't know what I was expecting. 

Was it a new species of fish? 

“They're shy.” Dad hummed. “Just stay there, and they'll come over to you.”

I found my voice strangled in my throat, my skin prickling with goosebumps. *“They?”*

Something warm expanded in my chest when a face appeared behind the glass—a beautiful girl with long dark hair haloing around her, tiny points on her ears and strange rugged skin. But it wasn't her face I was mesmerised by. 

Yes, she was hypnotising, every part of her seemed to glow, wide green eyes and a glittering smile. I staggered back, a cry clawing at my throat, when I realized she didn't have legs. Instead, a long blue tail was moulded to her torso, each scale intricate and sparkling. 

The skin below her waist was rugged, carved into her flesh.

Gills. This couldn't be happening, I thought, dizzily. 

I was staring at a real life mermaid. 

She was so pretty, graceful, gently tapping on the glass, playing an invisible piano with her fingers. I was joining in, laughing when the mermaid pressed her fingertips against mine, when movement came behind her, a shadow looming into view. 

It was a boy this time, dark brown hair billowing around him adorned with seaweed, a green tail in place of legs. There was a noticeable scar on his throat. 

It made me wonder if a fish had attacked him. The merman was different. Unlike his female companion, he *wasn’t* smiling, instead folding his arms and refusing to meet my gaze. When he accidentally made eye contact, he turned and flicked his tail in my face, hiding behind the girl. 

Dad laughed. “The male is quite standoffish. Don't worry, he's like that with everybody. He wasn't easy to catch.”

I could barely speak, staring at the girl, who waved, her smile broadening. 

“Uh-huh.” I managed to choke out. 

I didn't notice my father wrapping his arms around me. His touch felt foreign and wrong, but also comforting. 

I hadn't hugged him in so long. I found myself missing him, and the conversation I wanted to have, all of those poisonous words in my throat, contorted into childish squeals of joy. “They're yours, Sadie,” Dad murmured into my hair. “I have a deal where I can keep them here for observation, but they're officially *yours*.”

“Mermaids.” I said. 

Dad nodded. “Well, the scientific name for them is HAB, or human-like aquatic beings, but yes,” he chuckled, “They are mermaids.”

Dad paused, striding over to the tank. I noticed the male mermaid flinch, almost immediately swimming over to the glass, tapping his fingers against the pane. 

I joined him, raising my fingers while watching his dark brown curls fly around him, bubbles escaping his mouth when he parted his lips in what I *think* was a greeting. The points in his ears reminded me of fae, and I couldn't stop smiling. 

He looked so human, and yet these tiny details, like his ears, and  narrow features, told me he belonged in the ocean. 

I had dreamed of being able to breathe underwater, and this boy didn't need air to breathe, staring at me with coffee brown eyes. When his head inclined slowly, I couldn't resist a giggle. 

I figured I looked pretty alien to him. 

Dad nudged me playfully. “We haven't figured out their language yet. We know it's quite similar to whales, or even dolphins. It's rare when they do speak, but it's beautiful, Sadie.” Dad’s eyes were wide. “It's almost like they're singing the melody of their world: the songs of their people.”

I prodded the glass, and the merman copied, his lips curling into a scowl. 

The female mermaid swam over, shoving him out of the way. 

She seemed more excited, following my fingers excitedly. 

“What do you think you're going to call them?” Dad hummed. 

I turned to him. “They don't have names?”

He shrugged, and then Dad’s expression was my father again, his eyes growing sad, like he remembered why I was here– and just like me, Dad didn't want to talk about my brother. Turning to face the mermaids, his smile faded. “They were originally named specimen one and two, but I don't think those names suit them.”

I met the girl’s eyes, and like a child, her smile broke out into a grin. 

While she was wide eyed and smiley, the male mermaid folded his arms, carefully tracking me with his gaze, lip curled, like he could sense me thinking up names. 

I traced the glass, the seaweed entangled in the boy’s hair almost resembling a crown. I half wondered, giddily, if the male was a Prince. 

“Falan.” I said, without thinking, and to my shock, he rolled his eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat. “The male seems to have remarkably similar characteristics to a human male,” he said, “His paperwork suggests he copies human expressions.”

I moved onto the girl, who was playful, tapping her fingers against the glass. 

“Aira.”

The girl nodded excitedly, copying my smile. 

Dad was hesitant this time to touch me, instead clapping me on the shoulder. “I think she likes her name,” he said, heading to the door. “Elle is making pasta, if you want to join us? No pressure, sweetie.”

Dad left me with the mermaids, and admittedly, the first thing I did was jump up and down like a, well, a twelve year old. 

I ate dinner with Dad and his girlfriend that  night, and I waited to have “the talk” but it never came. In fact, when I visited the following weekend, everything I wanted to tell him was suffocated by the beings in his basement. 

I spent hours with the two of them, talking to Aira about everything from school to my worries about my mother
She would nod and try to listen, her eyes wide, like she could understand me.

I figured that wasn't the case when I lied and told her an asteroid was going to destroy the planet, and she nodded excitedly, lips spreading into a grin. 

Sometimes, she copied me. When I laughed, she did too– or she tried to. 

I don't think it was easy for her under the water. I started missing therapy sessions to spend time with the mermaids, but it was only Aira who engaged with me, always waiting for me when I arrived, sometimes asleep, curled up at the bottom of the tank. 

Falan, meanwhile, completely ignored me, instead spending all of his time either scowling at me, or closer to the surface. I caught him trying to swim up several times, only to dive back down, returning to his little spot to continue brooding. 

As I got older, I expected the mermaids to age, too. 

But instead, they seemed to be physically frozen around what looked like the ages of early twenties, judging from their looks. I turned thirteen, and I spent every summer and weekend with them. 

Dad told me to entertain them, try and get them used to human activities, so I introduced them to my phone, pressing it to the glass. While Aira seemed impressed (by literally everything), Falan did his signature eye roll, as if saying, “Oh, wow, it's a weird device with a light. I've already seen one.”

Dad did say the male mermaid was talented at mimicking human expression, so I figured Falan *had* seen a phone. 

So, in my quest to impress this stubborn merboy, I showed him a TV, and then my Nintendo 3DS. He didn't seem interested in the TV, but his eyes lit up when I showed him Pokémon. I think it was the bright colours, but his eyes seemed glued to the screen, following my little character. 

I made an unspoken pact with him. 

I showed him Pokémon, playing it with him every time I visited, and he stopped with the scowling and the rolling of the eyes. Falan didn't stop being an asshole, but every time I stepped into the basement, it was him who was waiting, eagerly, his face pressed against the glass. 

When he saw me, the merman leaned back, pretending he wasn't waiting for me. I showed him a new game, Zelda, and he surprised me with the smallest of smiles, his eyes glued to my screen. 

Aira sometimes joined us, but she grew bored easily, either falling asleep, or swimming up to the surface. 

After introducing him to video games, Falan was a lot more animated. 

I was fourteen when I dragged myself, once again, to Dad’s beach house. It was my first year of junior high, and I had nobody to talk to about the mermaids. 

When I came to them, Falan was on the surface, leaning against the side, his head comfortably nestled in his arms. I noticed the tank was open, so it must have been feeding time. 

Every day around 5pm, Dad opened up the tank, dropping in what looked like mutilated fish guts, and little flakes. Falan always ignored the food, while Aira immediately dove for fleshy entrails, stuffing them into her mouth. 

Falan needed a little coaxing, so Dad thrust a long metal pole into the water, gently nudging the merman towards the food. That day, there was no sign of my father, and both mermaids were on the surface. Falan, with his head in his arms, and Aira, looking lost, her eyes wide.

It was the first time I had seen her without her excited little grin.

Falan must have sensed me, since his head jerked up when I dropped my backpack on the floor. 

This was the first time I'd seen him fully on the surface, but when he locked eyes with me, I realized he was panting, struggling to breathe, his fingers gingerly prodding at his throat. The air must have been hurting him, I thought.

He wasn't used to our air, so why was he so insistent on staying on the surface? 

I made my way over to the tank, and to my surprise, he swam over, sticking his head over the side. Falan made a choking sound and I understood he was trying (and failing) to mimic our language. 

He tried again, his eyes strained, lips parting, but no words came out, only strange guttural noises I could almost mistake for words. 

This happened twice. 

The second time, the tank was half shut, but Falan broke the surface when he saw me come in, parted his lips, and tried to speak, seemingly frustrated with his inability to mimic human speech. He tried again, and this time l could see he was visibly struggling to stay on the surface. 

Aira, to my confusion, pulled him back under the water, and to me, pointed upwards. I did my best to communicate with her, just like dad told me. I had to speak with my hands instead of my mouth. 

“You want me to open the tank?” I said, motioning upwards. 

“Sadie.” 

Dad joined me, carrying a bucket full of entrails. He dumped the food in the tank and shut the lid all the way, flashing me a smile. “I know they're pretty to look at, Sadie, but they're also dangerous.” 

He nodded to Falan, who ignored the food, instead pressed against the glass, glaring at my father. “These beings are carnivores, sweetie. I don't mean to scare you, but I don't think swimming with them would be a whole lot of fun.” 

I found myself nodding, watching sharp red dilute the depths, Aira snatching up tangled fish intestine. 

I watched her eat it, sharp incisors biting through a cloud of red obscuring my vision and spreading around her. 

The smile on her face no longer looked playful. She looked happy to be eating, and something ice cold trickled down my spine when her eyes met mine, this time not with curiosity, but something else entirely, something I was in denial of. 

After that day, I guess I started to grow up. The mermaids in my Dad’s basement were beautiful, yes, but all signs pointed to them also trying to lure me into their tank. Dad didn't say *they will eat you*, but he did supervise my visits from then on, making sure I kept my distance. 

The two of them didn't change, but my childhood fantasy of friendly fish people darkened to a more plausible reality. Falan and Aira were not my friends, nor were they my presents. 

I was the naive prey who was almost fish food. 

I stopped visiting after Falan started gesturing me inside their tank. 

I wanted nothing to do with them. 

Growing up, I still saw them during holidays. 

But the basement was filling up with other things, my dad's belongings and my toys from childhood. I saw them once before college, the two of them slamming themselves against the tank when I walked in. I couldn't tell if they were excited or hungry. Aira’s eyes were almost sad, her lips parting as if to say, *You left us*.

Falan tapped the glass, cocking his head. I noticed his scar was bigger. 

Maybe Dad accidentally caught it when he was coaxing the merman to his food. 

I think Falan knew it was a goodbye. He didn't understand the concept of college, and I wasn't going to try to explain it to him. 

I left them like that, and never went back. 

Over these years, I wondered if Dad had released them back into the sea. 

Ever since I left home at eighteen, I've been flying to and from my new college campus every couple of months, due to a respiratory condition that came out of nowhere. 

I thought it was the mold in my college dorms, but when I moved to another room, I still found myself waking up, choking on air, like my lungs refuse to work. Numerous scans informed me I'm completely healthy, and all the doctor can give me is an inhaler. I was supposed to meet with a specialist in town anyway, so I figured I would pay dad a visit. 

I headed back to Dad’s beach house with the excuse to pick up some old  trinkets I left behind. There was no sign of him, so I let myself in, making my way down to the basement. Dad had changed the lighting to a duller blue, and immediately, I was comforted with the familiar stink of saltwater and strong bleach that smelled right. 

The stairs were *wet*, I noticed, slowly making my way down to the basement.

The tank was still there, illuminated in dazzling blue. 

But it was bigger. 

I saw Aira before she saw me, and I noticed a change in her. 

She wasn't smiling. 

Instead, the mermaid’s eyes were alert, her fingers tapping against the glass. 

“Hey.” I greeted her, a cough I couldn't control taking over. 

Aira jumped, startled, when I knocked on the glass. Her gaze found mine, and something twisted in my gut. Her expression was wild, contorted, and not what I remembered. When she pointed upwards for me to open the tank, I shook my head, biting back the urge to say, “Nice try.”

I could tell she hadn't eaten yet. The tank was fresh, so my dad was yet to feed them. 

“Where's Falan?” I asked, remembering how to talk with my expression. 

Aira didn't respond. With a stoic face, she pointed upwards again. 

The absurdity of me talking to my childhood mermaid friend sent me into fits of laughter– which became a coughing fit. 

When I spluttered out a cough, her eyes widened, and I swore her gaze flicked to my torso. With the mermaid mostly ignoring me, I went in search of my trinkets I left behind in one of the towering boxes filling the basement. 

I was looking for my music box, and an old mermaid figurine Harvey had given me for my fifth birthday. 

I found myself going through memory lane diving into boxes of old toys, and my endless collection of mermaid memorabilia. Shoving aside holiday decorations, I stuck my hands in another box, pulling out a folded yellow dress. 

The dress was cute, but I didn't remember wearing it. 

I thought maybe it was Elle’s, but it was way too small. Elle was a curvy woman. 

Throwing the dress aside, I pulled out cargo shorts this time. Followed by a short sleeved band shirt, and a lakers cap covered in dust. With the clothes in my hands, I had a sudden hysterical thought that these were my brother’s clothes. 

But he was dead. He died when I was nine years old. I could feel my hands starting to tremble, digging deeper into the box. This time, a backpack with a tiny Pikachu attached to the zipper. 

I went through it, pulling out workbooks and crumbled schedules, a bottle of water and a crumbling sandwich covered in mold.

Opening the workbooks, I flicked through pages and pages of intricate handwriting. 

A stress toy was at the very bottom of the pack, collecting dust. 

I could sense my breathing starting to accelerate when my hands grasped a bright green handbag filled with make-up, a dead phone, and a laptop. 

But it was right at the bottom of the box, where I found the nail in the coffin that sent bile shooting up my throat. Two college ID’s. The first, neat and looked after, on a red string, belonged to a scowling twenty two year old English major, Matthew Whittam. 

The second ID tag, covered in scribbles and doodles, was twenty three year old Quinn Cartwright, a smiling brunette, who, according to her tag, was a film student. 

The tag slipped out of my hands, and I puked, heaving up my mediocre dinner.

Aira and Falan. 

The beings in the tank were not mermaids. They were fucking HUMAN. 

Before I could stop myself, I grabbed the clothes again, the yellow dead with noticeable smears of red on the collar, and the cargo shorts torn and bloodied when I turned them inside out. I don't even remember standing up. With the ID tag in my hands, I strode over to the tank, pressing Aira’s identity against the glass. 

But she didn't even recognize herself, slowly cocking her head to the side. 

This hurt, a pang in my chest physically squeezing my lungs. 

This time, I opened the tank, and the girl broke the surface. 

She didn't speak, because she *couldn't*, instead flailing her arms. 

I thought back to the scar on Falan's throat, and I felt sick to my stomach. 

Instead of speaking, Aira pointed to the door, her eyes wide and desperate. 

“It's okay,” I told her calmly. “Where's Falan?”

When her eyes narrowed to slits, I caught myself. 

“Matthew.” I corrected, quickly. “Where is Matthew?”

Before she could respond, my father’s voice sounded from upstairs. 

Followed by what sounded like muffled screaming. 

Aira’s head snapped to me when the muffled screaming grew closer, my father’s footsteps following. I could hear the sound of something wet hitting concrete, like a tail. Aira pointed towards a box, and I understood, diving behind a large Amazon package. 

The wet slapping noises continued, all the way down the stairs, before my father appeared, a bloody apron over jeans and a shirt, dragging along a figure. It was another guy, lying on his stomach, blood spilling from his lips and nose, streaking down his bare torso. I had to slap my hand over my mouth. I could still see the guy’s legs, or what used to be his legs, twisted into something resembling a tail. 

His ears still looked human, the sharp points almost looked man-made. 

Dad dragged the boy across the floor, panting. “It's okay,” he told the boy who was half human. The guy was struggling to breathe, like a fish out of water. “Once your lungs have gotten used to the water, you'll adapt.”

When he yanked the boy by his grotesque legs slowly morphing into a tail, the boy coughed up something that dripped down his chin. His eyes were wide and unseeing, his arms dead weights by his side. 

Dad carried the boy up a ladder to the surface. I thought he was going to throw him in, but instead, my father pulled out a knife. 

“It's okay,” he kept telling the guy in sharp breaths, “I know it will hurt, but you won't be able to adapt if I don't do this.” I could see Aira watching, her hand over her mouth, as my father dragged the blade across the boy’s throat, slicing it open, and dumping him in the water. 

The boy sank, sharp red exploding around him, tainting the water. 

He was dead. 

His tail was limp, his arms dragging him down. 

Aira caught him, cradling the boy in her arms. 

Dad watched, a smile pricking on his lips. 

The boy jolted suddenly in Aira’s arms, his eyes shooting open, and when he breathed, he breathed by habit, clutching his chest, a stream of bubbles flew from his mouth. 

When the nameless boy caught hold of himself, he pounded his fists against the glass, lips parting in a silent cry. Dad ignored him, dumping fish guts into the water, and forcing him to eat them. 

It struck me why Falan and Aira were only alert when they didn't eat. 

My father was drugging their food, keeping them docile. 

He had cut their voices directly from their throat. 

Carved into their bodies, cruelly moulding them into my stupid fucking childhood fantasy. 

When my Dad left them, Aira tried to tell me to stay to help her calm down the new merman, who kept pounding his fists against the glass. But I think part of her wanted me to hunt down her companion. I knew from the panicked glances she kept sending me that she was worried for him. 

Dad said his office was out of bounds when I was a kid, and I never thought much of it. 

When I pushed through the door, which was surprisingly unlocked, I realized *why*. 

All around me, bathed in clinical white light, were towering tanks filled with both human and fish parts; floating torsos and severed heads, victims no longer with identities. 

Dad was studying how to combine the two. His notes were strewn everywhere, screwed up and thrown in an overflowing trash can, and pinned to the wall. 

I found Falan pinned to a surgical table, a tube stuck down his throat. 

The human man cruelly twisted into something *inhuman*, and yet my father was sadistic enough to continue the facade, leaving the seaweed entwined in his curls, like he was a circus act.

There was a sensor above him, every movement he made setting off a sprinkler, soaking him. It was when he *didn't* move, which glued me to the spot. When his tail dried up, I panicked, reaching to wave my arm in front of the sensor. 

Instead, however, to my shock, his tail started to change, contorting and morphing into *something* that resembled legs, but were more grotesque, cruelly stitched to his torso in a horrific attempt to change from a mermaid into a human boy.

When the sensor activated, soaking him again, Falan’s body jolted, and he choked up splattered red splashing the tube.

His eyes flickered open, and he opened his mouth to speak.

But his words were gibberish, his voice a incomprensible hiss. 

I remembered how to move. 

Police. 

That was my first thought. 

I needed to get the cops. 

I tried to leave, stumbling over to the door, but something caught my eye. 

Another tank, and floating inside it, an all too familiar face. 

But he wasn't supposed to be so limp, so *wrong.*

Unmoving. 

His body had long since decomposed, and yet pieces of flesh still remained, still my big brother, and yet his body wasn't.

His body was cruelly ripped apart and stitched together, a mutilated fish tail attached to his torso.

His skin was covered in mismatched scales, like a virus taking over, shredding him apart, only leaving a slimy, green tinged substance coating him. 

Harvey was dead. 

But the thing stitched to him, entangling decomposing flesh, was still *alive*. 

I got out of there, and then the house in four single breaths. 

I ran home.

I woke up yesterday unable to breathe, this time choking up blood. Mom wasn't there.

When I stepped into the shower, I pieced together my thoughts and what exactly I was going to tell the cops, without sounding crazy. 

But when my fingers grazed the skin of my torso, just below my breast, I could feel three singular gashes in my skin.

Gills. 

When I felt the other side, there they were, splitting my flesh apart, warm to the touch, and yet somehow feeling natural. 

I can't believe I'm saying this, but being in water feels better. I can finally breathe. 

But I find myself stumbling when I'm trying to walk. 

I keep getting out of breath, and my skin feels too dry. Like it's sucked of moisture. 

I tried to get into the basement earlier, and unsurprisingly, it's locked. There's no sign of Mom or Dad. The only thing I have right is Mom’s stupid pet fish. 

I feel like I'm suffocating on air. 

You have to help me.

* **Controversy Detector:** Posts with negative scores turn **Red** (starts at -5). Helps you spot the trolls immediately without reading their bad takes.
* **User Highlighter:** You can add specific users (like your beat writers/insiders) to a ""Gold List,"" and their posts will always be highlighted Gold.
* **Auto-Hide:** Added a toggle to just completely vanish posts with a score lower than -15.
* **Dark Mode Integration:** If you use the site's Dark Mode, this works well with that too.

It's completely free. Just a passion project I built during our head coach search to help sort through the noise. There is a 'Buy Me a Coffee' link in the extension if you find it incredibly useful, but of course no commitment there.

I'll try to put the link in the comments. I don't want to get shut down by the mods, so if that doesn't work, look for '247Sports Highlighter' in the Chrome Web Store.

Hope it helps y'all navigate the chaos. Good luck tonight, and in the playoffs.

Expensive stuff that gave me severe diarrhea for 10 days. It had all sorts of recommendations from FDA on their website which is false apparently. Stay away from this stuff. Also, the second bag I put up on Ebay dirt cheap and Ryze had it removed as fake. WTF. I guess they didn't like me undercutting their sellers on there. Again nasty stuff be careful with it.

Recently got a Genesight test done by a psychiatrist who does not prescribe my medications.

The primary findings were Intermediate CYP2D6 metabolism and that I am homozygous for MTHFR C677T.

The doctor said that this means my current dose of Adderall (25mg total; 20 ER and 5 IR in afternoon) is acting more like 12mg total in my system. He said I should start 15mg of L-methylfolate immediately as this will make all medications I take more effective (due to the MTHFR mutation). He said that even with this, the CYP2D6 metabolism will make it difficult to utilize stimulant medications, and that I should likely be on double my dosage of Adderall daily.

I've taken the L-methylfolate (folic acid) for a few days now with no noticeable difference. My afternoon dose (5mg IR) feels a lot more effective than my morning 20mg ER dosage, but that has been the case the entire time I've taken it. I've needed to drink coffee a couple hours after the morning ER dose to not feel sleepy this whole time as well.

I had taken Dexedrine previously with a different provider for 3 years and had no issues once I had the proper dose. This doctor asked why I am not just taking that and I said that my current provider says it is not FDA approved for ADHD, to which he said he would argue otherwise. He also said Dexedrine is around 4 times stronger than Adderall.

Current provider also said they (providers they interact with) are getting suspicious of what these pharma manufacturers are putting in the different generics as they are hearing that from lots of patients right now.

The current plan is to see if my pharmacy can dispense as written ""Adderall"" later this month instead of the generic for the extended release med and see if that changes anything.

For me, taking Dexedrine long term is the goal. I was on a relatively moderate dosage of that. I think increasing the Adderall to 50mg a day would increase the therapeutic benefit, but also the side effects. I'm unsure how to advocate for that with my current psychiatrist but maybe the genesight test results and information from this other provider will help.

Any discussion/advice/insight would be appreciated! I know we are all unique in our health but the information I've found on MTHFR and medication metabolism is slim.",4,1765040924.0,ADHDers,0,1.0,False

1pfu9y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_6EvieJoy9/comments/1pfu9y8/repost_writings_from_2018/,Re-Post: Writings from 2018,"When things were fresh - some of my writings from the new beginning.

When you choose with intent,  it's easy to let go of the options that are now in the past. When making a decision,  you can make it in love,  say ""I choose..."", and then let go of the other options. If the situation then changes,  adapt,  enjoy,  love,  be grateful for,  and accept it,  and then... Idk. It's open. Loving others the same as yourself is easy when you ask yourself,  ""what would I like if I were them?""

Do for others to support: Write a letter. Tell them in person. Give them a gift from the heart. Spend time with them. Pay attention to them. Listen to them. Encourage them. Assist them with what they ask for assistance with. Give them time and space when requested. Share all resources, knowledge, wisdom, and tools.

It's hard sometimes when friends request space, especially if either you or they are currently in a time in life perceived as ""difficult"". If you are in it, they may want to ""help"" in any way they can, and so end up having a hard time providing the space that was requested. If they are in it, it is sometimes cloudy to see through their own needs to recognize that you are taking care of your needs. Everyone is connected and one at all times. Physical distance means nothing. Words and time together are not always necessary for love, support, and encouragement. People choose what their priorities are, but choosing to spend time with yourself is not rejecting a friend, it's just choosing to prioritize your friendship with YOU and YOUR needs. If you feel that your needs will be best met in the time of space from others, that is ok. It is not ""wrong"" to choose yourself, because though we love others AS ourselves, it's SO important to remember that included in that is ""OURSELF"". We love them AS ourselves. Not MORE THAN ourselves, not LESS THAN ourselves. When they need time and space, we graciously give it. When WE need time and space, we request it in love and IN LOVE we can also stand by our boundaries as long as we desire them. 

...

In the end, everyone can be found in their own corners of the world or universe creating together, collaborating. One person will share an idea with someone, and they begin discussing and sharing. More people come together to discuss and share - using platforms, the ideas are shared constantly universally. Cut to a scene of an empty and abandoned white house, senate, house, banks... they look old and abandoned. Cut back to the people, taking action in their own communities. To show that nothing will get held up, that time is not a concept to care about any more or to enslave. Break the chains to clocks and money. Break the chains to bureaucracy and the resistance to change due to fear.

...

We don't have to villify. We don't have to pity. We don't have to fight. Welcome, encourage, engage, collaborate. Don't wait for permission. Use your own mind. We are the people, we have the power. Please join me. Can you see the world in your eyes? We need YOU. Clear away the rot. If there's no one near you to help, be the one to start helping and others will join.

I'm not a beat poet, I'm a me poet. I say what I feel from inside. There is nothing outside that I need when all truth comes from within. Are you willing to look inside? See the vision without fear? You'll see there's never been a need to hide. See the bankers in their caves, counting money in vain, gathering the greedy to create a new reality to keep the people enslaved, I feel the world, I am the world, we are the movement, We are the new, we are the now, we are the change, I'm not a beat poet, I'm just a me poet. Watch the beast as it falls with no war won or fought. Simple turning of attention, ignoring the show to see possibility. Use my potential to create my reality. Sharing together to unite in the beauty of chaos. They will fail they say...it's good they underestimate. When change happens it might just clear their cobwebs away, blow down the savage walls of fear leaving emptiness, a blank canvas of the mind. The perfect place to begin again. The world is in your eyes, you can see when you tear the walls down. Feed the love, not the fear, turn your attention to action. The great deception: that you are unimportant, the biggest lie that we don't need you, Such a farce that you can't make a difference, risk to change a world you share in is a risk worth taking. Take a leap of faith, dive in and find you catch yourself. We don't have a map, we have today. Can you let go of your plan? Can you let go of your pain? Can you let go of the safety of an unremarkable life? Can you see around the blinders? Turn around, don't make plans. I make ideas and then I act. When I fall I learn and my next step is to adapt. Change is what I'm made of and where I can breathe. We adapt our technology but keep our philosophy - is something wrong? We paint new faces on old ideas - but deep inside we feel unsettled. What will they do to save us? What are they doing now? What have they done in the past? What are they continuing to do? We have the power to save ourselves. We are the people. We need you to boldly go.

The walls come down, and they were built on magazine articles, news stories, individuals, etc... promoting fear and it's various devices. Promoting the need for more, promoting the need for consumerism, distracting from the reality of the greatness that rests in every single individual. The wall at first looks impenatrable from one perspective, but when the individual that appears to be trapped by the wall turns around, they see they were not surrounded by the wall. It is only because their eyes were locked on the wall that they missed seeing that they were never trapped. That it is and always has remained their choice. When they turn around they see that they join their drop to the multitude of the ocean of change. Include every great leader of change. Show them when they were first perceived as crazy or too much, then show their influence. Show the world in their eyes. Show them as equal to those who helped them and those they helped. Show real life clips of what people are doing in their communities and sharing freely, and inventions being made, dances, music, art... to heal the world. Then show everyone holding out their hands to the camera and the world beginning to become clearer and clearer over vision.

...

I think it's much easier to conquer a nation by dividing people, then teaching one group to fear the other while making the feared feel invisible and those who fear feel safe and secure as long as they're ""protected"" by the very one who is creating the struggle to begin with while the ones at the top are enjoying doing what they will since eyes are on the distraction they created.

...

When I'm told I can't do something... the more vehemently I'm told I can't, the more angrily I'm told I can't, and even when I'm told kindly I can't... well that just tells me I should DEFINITELY try, because I know I can at that point and that I should. How much more an impact something has that was once perceived impossible. What hope that can bring! I will always listen to the voice inside that I CAN. It's the only voice worth believing because it's the voice of SINGULAR truth. Even those with the very best intent can find themselves in the position of hindering another's potential if the other believes them when they say they can't. Encourage, speak in love, desire the best for others! Be uplifting with your words and thoughts. Do not say of someone that they can't, or that it won't work, or that they aren't doing it ""right"". What is right? Does anyone think they know everything? Does anyone think that every single thing they've ever been told is true, especially from those who benefit from the lie? Don't push the limitations you have CHOSEN for yourself on others who are seeking to improve themselves. Do not bring negative what-ifs to the conversation. There is never a need to cross bridges before you have come to them... that is only creating negative expectation, and in turn, fear of the future. Who knows the future? I intend to use my words and thoughts to uplift. I am a new person today and every day, and I choose to encourage. I choose to believe in and encourage possibility, creativity, imagination, and potential. We are all connected, encouragement for you is encouragement for me as well. I will choose love for me and you. 

...

Look others in the eyes. Put down what you're doing, focus on them. Give THEM your full attention. Show them they are heard.

...

There's nothing wrong with starting from scratch. In fact, it can be VERY beneficial. Start with your beliefs about everything, and then work your way out from there.

...

Put others above your fear. Love yourself and others equally. If you want to love others more, it's as easy as loving yourself more. When you see yourself in everyone, and you practice love for yourself, then you are practicing love for others. EVERYTHING is Reciprocal. Love and fear. The more you practice of one, the more you receive of it. It's as easy to change as a choice every moment which gets easier and easier the more you make that choice... as with all choices made on a regular basis, self-love, love for others, positivity, gratitude.... choices. You can choose to fear or choose to love. If you do not know what the future holds, then you do not know what your decision will yield no matter which you decide. Wouldn't you think that a choice made in love is worth anything? Wouldn't you think that giving yourself and others a chance for a good outcome is better than letting the negative ""what-ifs"" populate your thoughts? You can choose to let the positive what-ifs abound in your head if you desire, though I personally like giving my future lots of wiggle room to surprise me with much more than I have yet imagined. What if you chose to only make PRO lists and left out the CONs when you are making a decision in love for yourself and others? 

To practice love, we must surrender or ""let go"" of any fear we are creating as a ""what-if"". To practice love, we must always make decisions that are for the benefit of ourselves and others. To practice love, we must put others above our FEAR.

...

Is this making sense to you? Does it feel good? Does it feel like truth? Use your instinct and intuition as your guide. Don't overthink it. What does your ""gut"" tell you?

...

The LIE is ""good"" vs. ""evil"", the TRUTH is fear vs. love. It is easy to get caught up in the one because it sometimes appears to be the case based on each of our general ideas of ""good"". However, when you live in the mindset of ""good"" vs. ""evil"" then you automatically polarize yourself from the rest of humanity and all that is. Not one person has the exact same idea of ""good"" or ""evil"". Why segregate yourself? The GREAT NEWS is that there is no need to separate yourself in this way. Fear divides, but love brings us together. If you begin to re-train your mind to see everything in terms of fear or love, the TRUTH will show itself regardless of your perspective. Truth has the ability to link us all when we choose it. 

...

I accept my experience that I attract to myself. I attract what I want, and more than that, I attract what I don't know I want yet so that it surprises me with the magnitude and imagination to bring it about. I love everything about this moment. In this moment, I am living. This is my experience, and I am thankful for this moment. I feel calm right now. My freedom, my choice in every moment to decide my experience. The article about reducing food waste in the newspaper, the idea to reach out to those being educated about food waste, to expand with ""Shareourthings"". I have rest now. I have ideas now. I have opportunity now. I am using my potential now and in every moment. I am creating even now. Every moment I feel better. Every moment I AM better than the moment before. I AM and that is all that is required of me, to be. To be or not to be... I choose to be because I am. I choose. I am the ONLY one who has control over my feelings, and I do have control of them. I can choose to feel however I want to feel in any moment. I have that ability, and it gets easier and easier to use it every moment. 

Creation vs. destruction. To be or not to be. To be is better than not being. They are both choices, but ""to be"" means you are creating something. It means you are a positive force. It means you are bringing something forth into the world that you want to share, whether this be a thought, a word, a feeling... whatever it is that comes to YOU. Whatever it is that only you have thought of in that way. YOUR thoughts are original. ""To be"" means sharing who you are, who you REALLY are, underneath it all, with the world. It means being the piece of the puzzle you choose to be to create the magnificent picture of the world. Very little needs to be said of ""not to be"". In the very simplest of words, it means to choose to ""not be"" something... anything. It doesn't matter what you are specifically choosing to ""not be"", it's that your focus is turned from ""to be"" to ""not to be"". Whatever you focus on is what you attract in life. So, ""to be or not to be"". I choose ""to be"" because ""I am"". 

Just by being a positive force, you ""infect"" that which you interact with. By radiating positivity and love, those around you can't help but adjust themselves to the new feeling you are creating. It does not matter if you are physically near those with whom you interact... this infection is invisible and travels through all means of communication - especially non-verbal communication that comes in the form of action. It's not only that you attract that which is like to what you are creating, it's that you are a catalyst for the change you feel in all that is around you. It's attracted to you and it's coming to you BECAUSE you are creating it. When you create for the purpose of loving others in whatever way that manifests for you wherever you are with whatever you have at whatever time, you are creating that which you are giving to others for yourself as well. Your world cannot help but adjust to YOU. Love conquers all fear. When YOU love, YOU conquer fear. When you CHOOSE LOVE, FEAR CANNOT EXIST.  

Choosing to talk positively about every situation goes hand in hand with choosing to think positively about every situation. If you wouldn't say it, then don't think it either. You can create new mental habits that PHYSICALLY affect your actual brain. By simply choosing to think a positive thought in the place of a negative thought, you weaken the old habit of thinking negatively and create/strengthen a new habit of thinking positively. This is your neural network, and it can be changed simply by changing the way you think. As you progress with this exercise, it naturally becomes easier and easier until the old way of thinking literally withers out of disuse. What we experience is always what we are attracting to us out of our thoughts.

When you choose to think positively, you have a positive experience. You WILL see opportunities you otherwise would have missed because you have changed your way of thinking about things. You no longer use fear as your tool for making decisions in a knee-jerk way, but instead you have the freedom to CHOOSE. YOU CHOOSE. You choose which thoughts to give attention to, which feelings you prefer to feel at ANY time no matter WHAT the circumstance. In CHOOSING to change, you begin to purposefully create your experience. All of this to explain the idea behind ""choosing to be happy"". It is a much quoted idea, but it's more than an idea! THE GOOD NEWS is that you have the choice right now and in every moment you experience anything. 

I choose to live as a skeptic and to only believe (or make agreement with) those things that would lift limitation from me. The more I learn, the more I view from my new perspective of positivity, the more I change all beliefs into limitless possibility. I will always believe that I am limitless in every way. If I can't do it yet, it only means I should practice adjusting my perspective because all things can be done. I am free because I choose to be. I am free from limitation. I can do anything and be anything I choose to be. We all have free will... absolute free will. **Circumstance is the setting, not the decision.**

**...**

Just as when you talk about someone else,  what you think about someone or anything else is a reflection of your thoughts toward yourself?

**...**

Is every thought and every word a prayer?

**...**

When you feel like someone's watching you

And want to run and hide

Look there, look deep within your heart

To see who is inside. 

...

Could fearlessness just be love in action 100% of the time? You have faced all of your fears so they can no longer keep you from always loving yourself and others with all of your heart. But not alone of course. You're never alone and it was not by your strength alone. A good thing to remember for humility. 

...

You are only as limited as you believe you are: physically,  mentally, emotionally. You're age doesn't matter. No matter how young you are or how old.  The young have just as much to teach the old.  If we choose to share information and ideas,  we can grow closer to one another and gain wisdom and understanding.  

Today, a child told me about their 3 superpowers.  They can feel their hands being massaged when they hold them out and relax. They know things before they happen.  They imagine they are on a boat every night and can literally feel their bed rocking, they say this is how they never get seasick.  I encouraged them in this and told them how great those were.  I hope they continue to believe in themself and these things they are very much experiencing and manifesting for themself.  I will always encourage them and everyone else to believe in the good they perceive. In the process,  I get to open my mind to other things that I may not have known about and can hopefully share the same with others.  In this way we share our perceptions in love and become complete by knowing, understanding,  and so loving as self every living being we try this with.  It's the same idea as walking a mile in someone's shoes. If you don't know someone's entire story,  how can you? Be open to hearing what they have to share,  because it comes from a different viewpoint. In this way, the more living things you understand, the more eyes you have.  You're able to see more,  the bigger picture,  the whole of things. Your way becomes more illuminated, and in the process you illuminate the way for others.  Together,  whole and complete we will proceed. Always learning and growing in love.

...

Do unto yourself as you would do unto others. Think of yourself as you allow yourself to think of others.  For example,  you are thinking of anything when you think to yourself ""what a dumb thought,  I'm an idiot"". Would you ever say that to anyone else? Don't say it to yourself.  Instead, talk to yourself as you would talk to others. If your friend comes to you with a challenge they are facing,  you don't tell them it's impossible or they'll never figure it out.  You tell them they can do it and to keep trying.  Do the same for yourself.  Give yourself the same advice you give others.  Listen to yourself. Love yourself and care for yourself,  just as you do others. 

...

I finally get ""your will be done"". Make a decision based on what you want, decide to work toward it in that moment and every moment you're in,  then acknowledge that you have no control over it beyond that and that if you feel led differently at any point,  you will go where you're led. 

...

Embarrassment is a fear of not being perfect.  It follows that you are striving for perfection if you get embarrassed.  Fear of failure just shows you what you want if you look at what you're most afraid of failing at.  What do you feel worst about in your life? Like you're ""failing"". It's at the things you most value. So instead of focusing on the negative feeling of fear,  now you can focus on what you actually value because now it's visible to you. 

...

I read something today that said that a thought is not who you are. What a powerful statement. I have found in the past that I feel like a failure for thinking horrible thoughts. They come unbidden. I've spent some months working on changing my thoughts, and when they jump FIRST to negativity it hurts. It hurts when I don't catch it immediately as well... I feel like I'm going back to square one or forgetting... I read that you can't go back to sleep after you've woken up though, so I am comforted. I want to think of the positive first. I want to think in a healthy way. I wonder if the struggle ever ends or if thinking of it as a struggle is part of the problem...solution? I want to break the cycle. I want to be the ONE - in whatever capacity that means. What does it mean to embrace the dark with the light? Where are the bad thoughts coming from? Do they come from me or from another? Is someone purposefully trying to sabotage me or is someone just trying to make me stronger? I noticed that when I was so scared of my thoughts when I first waking up, I came out of that nearly fearless of death and nearly fearless of ""scary things"". I can watch the most terrifying movie now (something I would never have done before I woke up) and see hope, positivity, and the symbolism that teaches. So what am I learning from these thoughts? Maybe I am becoming stronger, even more fearless, and ultimately prepared for what I am to do. That has a ring of truth. I'm going to keep listening. 

...

You will always be believed with ease if you are always honest with yourself and others.  Then you also have an enormous responsibility to never purposefully mislead. 

...

Always try to see that nothing goes ""wrong"". Events occur. If you are trying and hoping for what you want in life, they will occur exactly as they should. If there is something that appears to be a ""mishap"", there is probably something that can be learned from it. Being nervous when in situations with others could be a fear of looking silly or stupid. If you decide that it's ok to look silly or stupid at any given time, then you will be able to focus more clearly on that which is important to you instead of your nerves. Accept that if something goes ""wrong"", it actually went very right and there is a big reason for it. Look for that reason! Was it to make others laugh at you, put them at ease, see that you are human exactly like them, learn from you brushing it off and accepting it with grace? What about changing your opinion? You can apply this here as well. Did you use to believe something, even yesterday, even a moment ago that you no longer believe? Have you ""flip-flopped""? Have you changed who you are? Maybe you have changed who you are and maybe you HAVE flip-flopped, but why should you not? Why should anyone ever resist changing their opinion or changing themselves? If you accept that you do not know everything (and that includes whether or not you are ""right"" in any situation), then you cannot choose to keep your mind unchanged because you do not allow your ego to build on top of always-held or even newly-held beliefs thus opening your mind and heart to others opinions and ideas.

It is much easier to tame an ego that has no foothold than to destroy all that the ego is built on. Ego should sit on sand.

I like to see my ego as a massive King Cobra! I am there in my mind with my King Cobra... I usually sit beside my Cobra so that I can keep close watch... he likes to slither up to the controls and mess with the buttons even though he doesn't know how things work and ends up mashing everything and causing a mess. He's pretty much like a baby in that way! Every now and then when I get a twinge in the back of my throat or above my heart that feels ""off"" or wrong, I know that I need to look at my Cobra to see what he is up to. One day I was reading about some good things that someone was doing in the world, and I felt a twinge. I wondered why reading about good things made me feel bad in ANY way and discovered my Cobra at the controls furiously trying to make me believe that I was too late to the party and my dream of being a part of making the world a better place was slipping out of my hands because someone else already knew and was already doing it. My Cobra was trying to tell me that I had to be the FIRST one, the BEST one, the one to receive ALL recognition. I then took the time to see if My Cobra's viewpoint aligned with my values and of course they didn't. I know who I want to be every moment, and in that moment I knew I wanted to be someone who wants above all to see the good in the world and the love spreading through everyone. I knew I wanted everyone to reach their full potential which is to say, they are doing what they love while loving and helping others and bettering our society family. My Cobra has a hard time believing me when I tell him that there is plenty of love and recognition for him as well and that he will always have everything he needs. Then I look at my Cobra lovingly, feed it a snake snack, and play it a lullaby on my snake charming instrument so that it will sleep peacefully and happily. Then I rest beside my sleeping Cobra in his basket and pet my beautiful Siberian Tiger, who is on my other side, always steady and strong and full of latent power. 

...

You never have to worry about making a fool of yourself if you are always willing to adjust your perspective, laugh at yourself, and move on. If you look closely at those things that give you ""nerves"" when involving other people, ask yourself why you are nervous. Is it because you think something could go wrong? 

...

Always let hope make your decisions for you. 

...

Choose to always believe that time is free and that there is plenty of it. You live in this moment,  how could you ever lack time? You have plenty, all you need in every moment. You are time. Time is you. 

...

People will only trust you if you genuinely love them. All beings intuitively know the difference between real and fake love.  To genuinely love you will, with help,  overcome your ego and truly treat others as yourself.  You will always have everything you need AND desire.  You'll find both change as you change.

...

Be like Hermione.  She set out to show a better way of life to a race of beings who knew only slavery and didn't want freedom.

...

Anything and everything you ever create or even SAY has truth! You may not realize it, but you already know the truth. Listen to yourself.

...

I wonder if long ago, we knew how to pilot the earth. I wonder if we were headed somewhere. I wonder if once we set course and put it on autopilot, people started forgetting because it was so far away. Are we traveling toward lights? Are the sun and moon our guides? A star somewhere else? Now everyone has forgotten and we're almost there. We have to come together now so that when we arrive, we are the travelers that another civilization would love to meet and grown/learn with. We can only do this by coming together. Maybe when we do come together, we'll remember....?

When you get discouraged, always remember, love is infinitely more powerful than hate. Your dreams are more powerful than anything could negate. No one by saying or doing anything can stop your dreams from becoming. You are the only person who could do that, and just by daring to dream you have started a snowball that will only grow. You have added your light to the fire. Once you add a burning stick to a bonfire, do you think you can pull it out? Who can? You cannot! You can't even get close enough to pull it out! Those who hate the truth might try to throw water on your stick, but they would have to put out the entire bonfire to put out YOUR stick. Every single person can and does help the balance. All the water in the universe could not put out the sun. Our bonfire is the sun. 

...

Who can be told the meaning of life? How can anyone convey the concept? I first believed because I started searching for answers, but something called me to search. Something calls everyone to search. If you search, you're going to find what you're looking for. I can tell people that. I can tell people everything I have learned... but I wonder. Will they learn from the words, from their soul song, both? Will the words help them hear? Something helped me hear. I was searching and that movie, the Secret, helped me hear the only part I needed to start my journey. Then I was given an option, continue or ignore? It was like the Matrix. If you choose the red pill, you can never go back. I leaped for that red pill. I will never go back!

...

All that is being said is what has already been said, differently.... from my little view point. My contribution. My piece of the puzzle is the song I sing. My piece is this.

...

It's so important to treat others as yourself because everyone is you and you are everyone. Everyone just is. We have different experiences on this planet which is the only thing that makes us different, a good different. This is a unique different that enhances us. It is a way of growing. Imagine one giant person who has decided to make themselves into millions of people. This giant person can't possibly remember everything they know in their giant body in millions of small bodies. That's too much information. How could one experience anything different if everyone knows everything? So what if everyone is given a song in their heart... a way to remember there's more and a way to keep them just awake enough to be living. Is the song their soul? Is the song what connects them to one another? It is. It is the heart beat of everything. We are separate for now, but we are one. How can you remove from existence or harm or deter or belittle or ignore a part of you? Every part of you is important! Every part of you has a purpose. To move forward, all parts of the body must work together. We must all come together. We are. When one candle is lit, it lights those around it until the whole world shines. 

...

When you discover the meaning and purpose of life, you discover that you still don't really know it. You discover that there's more than you thought could be imagined. You discover that you are not in control. The more you learn, you continually realize that you are still at the beginning of knowledge. You realize that we all know as much as everyone else, we just know different pieces. If you work together, you put more and more together. To make your knowledge complete, join with others in telling the story. You'll never get to the end alone, no one will. Everyone will arrive together, healed and whole and ready for the next adventure. 

...

IMAGINE that everything is a symbol made specifically for you to lead you to your destiny. Your epic journey. The meaning of life. The meaning of YOUR life. Earthly mysteries are all solved, and now you are left only with those spiritual mysteries that will be solved in their own time on your journey. You can't make the journey speed up, but neither can you make it slow down or stop. You can only be aware of it and open to learning what you can from each moment.

...

Don't take yourself or anything too seriously. If you make a mistake (as you will) your ego will be much harder to calm if you believe you're serious and important. If someone misses the point, there's no need to validate your words. Let them believe and see from the point they are at right now. You do not know the full meaning of your own words! Can you see every perspective? If you can't, imagine that someone is seeing another piece of the truth, and listen rather than get defensive. They did not miss the point, they saw another one.

**...**

There is nothing that is ""right"" or ""wrong"". There is no ""correct"". I there is something that you don't agree with, then change your perspective to see the truth inside it. 

**...**

You can be inspired by your own thoughts because your conscious mind may not in fact be the author of those thoughts. You can read your thoughts over and over again enjoying them, reveling in their brilliance and rejoicing in their truth. You can believe your thoughts just as thoroughly and fully as you can believe the quotes of great minds. This is because you know that everyone has this capability. Another's thoughts may look different or be laid out differently, be in a different language, or seem silly/incoherent... but if you change your perspective, you can always find the truth and the beauty. You can enjoy everyone's thoughts. You can find the good in it all. Thinking well of yourself and your thoughts is not wrong. It is not conceit, but gratitude. 

**...**

Because everyone else is brilliant, does not make me less brilliant. I am brilliant differently than anything else in the entire universe. There is only one me that sees exactly how I see. I can share ideas with someone and learn new thoughts and see a new perspective that I could not have come up with on my own since I see in my own unique way. Together WE can put together the pieces of our thoughts and experiences to form a whole story and map of who we are and what we're meant to be/do. It is the purpose of life. 

I am brilliant AND so is everyone else.

...

You can't teach people how to change the world, but you can teach them how to change themselves.

The name of God is Love. I bet if you were able to measure the concept of love it would be the answer to the most complicated equations that delve into the mysteries of the universe.

...

When we learn how to love each other,  the world will naturally become utopia.

A place to grow.

Whatever I'm doing in any given moment is exactly what I should be doing. There can never be any fear of missing out when I know with all assurance that there is nowhere else I should be because then it wouldn't be my story anymore if it wasn't exactly where I was in that very moment! Knowing this, there can never be dissatisfaction in traffic...standing in line...going to work...waiting for ANYTHING, because there is purpose and reason in EVERY moment. 

...

Today I'm feeling... a little tired, physically and emotionally... mainly emotionally in the sense that I feel the need for extended completely alone time. Though... thinking of that, it would probably just be nice to get a few weeks with no obligations except to my immediate family. My circle is expanding and I believe it's going to expand exponentially over the years, and yet I still enjoy my alone time and feel as though it is necessary. When can I find time for me? I like little hours here and there, they're delicious treats... and I would also like a longer vacation. I would like a week with husband somewhere soon... 

That is main feeling that I have right now. I'm happy, expectant, and content. I feel as though everything is as it should be. My desire as always is for the box. Maybe I'll find I don't need alone time, or maybe I will always have enough and feel that I have enough. Either way is perfect! I love alone time so much but I know my heart can change if my soul desires it. Right now? Some warmth, so I'm going to make myself some coffee and then get back to work. 

Maybe I do feel something more. I am waiting so expectantly to talk with my inner self... plainly. To put away allegory and symbolism briefly, perhaps, and talk. What would I even say? Would I have questions? I feel like me saying anything or asking anything is unnecessary though. I've been thinking enough - I just want to listen. So I know we will. I don't know how or when, but I know we will and I am content with that. 

...

What if time ACTUALLY goes slower when you're having fun?

...

EVERYTHING is a habit that has been taught as the ""norm"". We follow certain sets of rules mostly based on what we've been told and have created a habit of living that way. WHAT IF we did an elimination diet with our habits? How much healthier could we be? 

...

When you said ""I have everything I need"" before, you thought you were ONLY saying you had everything in the physical world that you need... but you were ALSO saying that you have everything you need in EVERY way.

...

More ideas from more minds creates something that you could not create on your own that you are wanting. So WANT. Talk about what you want, think about it, share it... it will be molded and shaped. 

...

Keep talking about your dreams, invite others to join in talking and presenting their ideas, take their ideas and use them allowing the entire creation to be theirs if they want it... knowing that it doesn't matter who OWNS it, what matters is that what you are wanting to create will be created. Together is easier and increases joy. 

...

Launch your creations TOGETHER. Enjoy TOGETHER. Communicate and invite to join in the creating process to increase their joy. 

...

Floating in space. Thinking you're alone. The horrifying thoughts could last for a long time... but when you finally get silent, as you must... you realize you are not alone. The joy of that experience makes the struggle a part of it. The struggle then becomes Joy. Once you can always SEE the struggle as joy, when can you not be joyful? 

...

How to Win. A story about a journey to learning how to be happy, then what follows is an epic and beautiful adventure. Scary at times, but beautiful the entire time. 

...

Maybe we are all angels - able to be exactly what someone needs at any given time - if we just let go of our control and let our inner being work through us. They are omnipotent and omniscient. We may not know ""how to"" help, or reach any goal (our own or others), but if we believe that every word is truth then we can open the portal even wider and understand more of what we are saying when we allow the other to take that control. 

...

Free will is the ability to make whatever choice you want. Freedom is the knowledge that it doesn't matter what choice you make, you will achieve your ""fate"" or ""destiny"" regardless. You will find what you are actively seeking. 

...

There are no wrong choices. There never have been, and there never will be. You have free will to decide which path you want to take at any given moment, and in that path, whatever you chose, you will find what you are seeking because it has already found you and is just asking you to listen. Free will is the ability to make whatever choice you want. Could you miss out on your destiny (the thing which the ""other"" is guiding you toward) if you don't listen? Can you possibly choose not to listen? When you are called can you ever go back? I don't believe you can go back, but I don't know if you can make a decision to stay deaf...

1pfu9hs,https://i.redd.it/awib7g9i8m5g1.png,Thinking of switching from coffee to caffeine tablets. What should I expect,"I came across a caffeine tablet on Instagram that mentions added ingredients for better absorption. It got me wondering how much of a difference these extras actually make. From what I understand, caffeine itself doesn’t have a slow release effect unless there’s a specific release mechanism or something like L theanine paired with it to smooth the impact. So I’m not sure if tablets like these can genuinely prevent the usual spike and crash, or if they’ll just behave like a stronger version of coffee.

That’s why I’m asking people who use caffeine tablets regularly. Are they safe to take daily in practical terms, and how do they compare to drinking coffee? Does the energy feel steadier through the morning, or is it the same quick rise followed by a dip? I’m trying to cut down on random cups of coffee but don’t want to switch to something that feels identical or affects my sleep.

If anyone has real day to day experience with tablets that contain caffeine plus a few added ingredients, it would be helpful to know how they felt for you. I’m mainly curious about steadiness of energy, any afternoon crash, and whether they interfered with sleep.

I (47M) will preface this by saying that I tend to be skeptical of supplements, as my grandma had an entire closet full of them when I was growing up.   
  
That said, when I started my SSRI (Zoloft) earlier this year, my sex drive tanked completely, which was about as fun as that sounds. I did my homework in hopes of restoring it, because I felt like I lost a vital part of myself overnight.   
  
I soon discovered people online using maca root to boost libido while on anti-anxiety meds. I also learned it helps women with libido and perimenopause/menopause symptoms. While my wife (42F) has not tried this for perimenopause (she uses HRT), the research at the link below can tell you more about how it might help your spouses. I can tell you maca restored my libido in about 10 weeks. 

Wondering how you ingest this stuff? I opted for the powder form and add 1 tsp (3 oz.) to my coffee or daily protein shake. Super simple. Tastes malty.

Kantou (and a brief few hours in Niigata). 30 arcades visited.","I wrote a post here for my first solo trip in May 2024, but I never got around to writing a second post for my trip with my wife in October 2024 (so if I make any references to “we” in this post, it’s referring to us being on this prior trip). For reference, it’s here (https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1cv5fqi/trip_report_0505_0517_mainly_tokyo_iidx_traveling); I will try to keep my writing more direct and plain this time. For this visit, the timing presented itself such that I had a milestone achieved, so this was something of a celebratory event, and if I didn’t go now, I likely wouldn’t be able to be back until May 2026 at earliest, and with the way things are across the world at present, it had a now-or-never feel to making the trip.
Home base: Sugamo, same as prior trips. 

Target: Get my third 関東覇王 badge in IIDX, requiring visits to all of the Kantou prefectures for at least one play. Also, visit another arcade further out. Fulfill a shopping list that requires stops at a few specific locations. Beyond that, no hard itinerary was set.

Weather: Overall, I don’t think I could have been more fortunate in being here than now. Temperatures were mostly 15 °C during the day and 5 °C at their lowest at night, with only a few drops of rain to be seen on some days. For the majority of the time, the temperature and sun exposure were at an exact spot where walking around felt fully comfortable, and I rarely broke a sweat. 

*Tuesday, November 25*

**Sugamo**

The flight out from O'Hare left at 5:30 PM, so I knew that today wouldn’t give much of an opportunity to do anything upon arrival other than check in and sleep. I left the Haneda gates at 11:00 PM, and I was surprised by the Yamanote crowd at that point. I took a brief walk around near the hotel, as there was little else to do, and I had two small discoveries. One was that there is a nearby Seiyu with a 24-hour section. On our second trip, we discovered an Okashinomachi store in Omiya, and I didn’t realize it had several other locations, including Sugamo. Noted.

*Wednesday, November 26*

**Oyama, Tochigi. Tamado / Shimodate, Ibaraki. Kashiwa, Chiba.**
I did take flu vaccines a few weeks before the flight, and the prior news and threads made me apprehensive about exposure; sure enough, I woke up with a sore throat sensation and other allergy symptoms. I did remember to bring some TheraFlu packets with me, and I took those along with some Emergen-C supplements as part of my usual morning vitamin regimen; placebo effect or not, nothing worse than this ever developed, thankfully. One thing I did forget to bring – anti-perspirant deodorant, so let’s add that to the shopping list. 
I rely on white noise for sleeping, and the hotel didn’t allow for temperature control beyond increasing the heat, so I had no source of noise from an indoor fan to use. The room was stuffy enough when I arrived, so the only option they mentioned was to open the window. This works well enough until it’s 4:00 AM and people are doing trash pickup at street level, making a lot of noise that carries right in. The solution I had was to find a 12 hour white noise clip on YouTube and play that on my phone overnight. After a few days of searching for a small fan while shopping, I couldn't find anything at a size and price that I was happy with, so I ended up using this method every night.
Given the uncertainties regarding wellness and anticipating travel lag, I resolved to make my longer day trips first and then keep things local at the end. The weather forecast indicated that some rain was expected in Niigata today, so I started by covering the relatively northern areas of Tochigi, Ibaraki, and Chiba. First stop, Oyama. This felt largely the same as it did in October 2024. An interesting encounter was a local scrapper driving around that used a loudspeaker to rattle off a prerecorded list of items it was accepting as it moved. When I arrived at the early hours of that day, it was an interesting sensation to hear only that voice echoing through the streets. Due to bag restrictions and not having any coins at the moment, a second-hand store that we didn’t get to visit was the Fujishoten, so I made sure to go there this time. It had less in the way of manga and games and more clothes. It also had an large adult section that I didn’t bother to look at. Next over to the Surugaya, and I was able to find an original tamagochi in its box among other items. The IIDX play at Apina Oyama was expectedly quiet. On my prior trips, I made my Ibaraki stop at Miraidaira, but that arcade is now closed, so I needed to find a new spot that would align with train accessibility. The Mito line has a terminus in Oyama, so I used that to go to Tamado and walk to Apina Shimodate. A lesson learned here is to cross streets where you can see the crossings, because it may be a while before you can find the next point to get across. Someone was playing at Shimodate upon arrival, but we politely exchanged turns once so that I could get my badge and get moving. The internal air temperatures at both Apina locations were very warm. I walked into the Book Off there before getting back to the Mito line and didn’t see anything interesting. From here, I resolved to get the Chiba badge knocked out, so I rode Mito further east to board the Joso Line from its terminus at Chikusei. The cars on Joso are one single unit that rides on one single rail, where the trains will move off track at stop to let the opposing traffic go through. Two quaint relics on this car were a digital LED board to show riding prices between stops, and an automated machine to accept printed tickets, but neither were in operation. At the third stop of Kurogo, a local school class boarded at once, so it became extremely crowded inside. I had to stand in a pack all the way down to Moriya. Transferred using Tsukuba Express to Nagareyama Otakanomori, then used Tobu Urban Park line to get to Kashiwa. I had to stumble around a bit to finally remember how to get to the basement to find Kashiwa Gulliver’s, and there were a few people in line to play IIDX, so I kept moving since I knew that there was a Taito Station nearby. Got the third badge today. I knew the day was wrapping up, so I swung by the Bic there to knock some things out. One item that I found was a proper mahjong set, and that becomes rather burdensome to carry around. The onsen was very welcome this evening.

*Thrusday, November 27*

**Niigata-shi / Iwamuro, Niigata.**

The weather forecast indicated 60F and no rain, so I made my way for Niigata. Today’s destination is an arcade that I have seen frequently mentioned in my personalized feeds: Playhouse Erina. I used the hotel’s phone number and address for registration through eki-net, and I was able to successfully link it to my phone’s Suica card. Then, I simply ran searches on the inbound and outbound trips to pay for digitally validated tickets, and I was set. I braced for problems on both directions and never encountered them – it seems that once you clear the gates bound for the shinkansen, you’re indeed good to go. When travelling outbound, once you go beyond Takasaki on the Joetsu shinkansen, the scenery becomes very picturesque, with several town areas oriented along various elevations and mountainous terrain in the backdrop. I arrive at Tsubame Sanjo and briefly ride the Yahiko and Echigo lines to arrive at Iwamuro. From here, it is a full fifteen-minute walk to reach the arcade, and this isn’t just a fifteen-minute walk among stores or houses – it is a fifteen-minute walk on a paved road that cuts through rice fields. A recent thread I’ve seen on Reddit discussed Japan’s current overtourism issues, and a poster logically stated that nobody would come to Japan to see the rice fields of Niigata. I have now seen and walked through these fields, and I can confirm that they are indeed rice fields located in Niigata. True facts. While walking out, I did take a moment to record an Echigo train going through the intersection – the view is a half kilometer away, the train runs on the ground through a small village with a large mountain in the background, and the sound of the crossing pierces cleanly through the air as you stand amongst nothing but rice. It was like being in a living postcard. Notably, the weather could not have been more perfect – an exactly desirable temperature, light cloud cover, and still air; a great day for a walk. I arrive and have my plays. I do carry around one power bank, and sadly, by the time that I made it there, I only had maybe 25% remaining on my power bank, so pictures were kept to a minimum, lest I lost all power and would become truly stuck without having my phone. The location is not particularly large, but it has an excellent selection of new and older Bemani machines, as well as a second room featuring several other older games and multicabs. Before leaving, I expressed my thanks to the owner, and he inquired about having a social media account – I showed him the post I made, and I confirmed that he reposted it later that day. Thanks. Between the timing of the connecting trains, the shinkansen on the way back, and the amount of power on my phone, I wanted to make sure to leave soon enough so that I wouldn’t get stranded. I had some time to walk around Iwamuro and take pictures, and it was very evident that they were not expecting to see someone like me there. A local stray cat did come out for some petting; that was nice. The local small grocery and snack shop by the train station only takes cash, as expected. I make it back to Tokyo proper by about 8:00 PM, and I resolved to get a second power bank immediately so that I wouldn’t encounter similar difficulties in the future. I went to Ikebukuro and visited the flagship Bic store to find one that would work with my phone. As it uses a Lightning port, it was difficult to find one that had that plug natively built into the unit. I suppose most of them assume you'll use a universal cable to connect the bank to the phone. While here, I played a round at the Taito Station near the train station, so I earned the Tokyo badge, and it left me with three more to go.

*Friday, November 28.*

**Takasaki, Gunma. Omiya, Saitama. Kawasaki, Kanagawa.**

While planning the trip and days out, I contemplated including these first two stops on my way back yesterday, since they all connect to the Joetsu shinkansen, but given the timing and power issues yesterday, I devoted these stops to a separate day. For some reason, Google Maps tried to have me stay on the Utsunomiya line as I moved out to Takasaki; in my research before the trip, I scouted Koga as a place for my Ibaraki stop, and I’m glad that I did that, because the train’s announcing it was bound for Koga was my clue for me going the wrong way now. The mistake was quickly fixed at Toro, but I was still mad that I knew that Google Maps was wrong and still blindly followed it anyway. It was rather windy at Takasaki that day, with plenty of leaves being blown around as I made the walk to the store. In all three trips I’ve made to date, Mandai Shoten Takasaki has proven to be a location that has goods that I do not see anywhere else, and the prices are reasonable as well. Among the fun items that they had were blind bags of various used games for 1500Y, so I picked up a Z-Rated bag for PS4. IIDX play was good here. Back down to Omiya by midday, had my IIDX play there, saw nothing great at that Book Off, then resolved to get down to Kawasaki and finish the badge run, as I anticipated being back in Omiya in the future, and I had enough time now. One item I preplanned was to have the final location badge earned at a different prefecture from the prior trips; the first was finished at Gunma, the second was at Chiba, and this was completed at Silk Hat Kawasaki Dice. I finally found a good screen for plays at this location and enjoyed my time there. I went to check its Book Off, but they decided to close midday for inventory – on Black Friday (and given how much Black Friday is indeed advertised there, it isn’t unreasonable to think that they would have had at least standard hours that day). Another item on the shopping list was some new ladies' lip gloss that was an exclusive at 7-11. It was launched today, and I needed to hop to a few of them before finding two of each color as requested, as they were definitely being sought out and purchased by other people. The display unit is a small box, and it is very easy to miss. 

*Saturday, November 29.*

**Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro.**

On our last trip, I noticed a double-decker bus called the Shibuya Street Ride, and I made a point to ride it on this trip.  The bus is easy to book online and follows a route that starts in Shinjuku and ends in Shibuya. Meanwhile, there are several public street view online cameras of various locations in Japan, one of which is located in the Kabukicho area of Shinjuku. Once I found where it exactly was, I made plans to appear on it, and now my wife and parents both have screen grabs of me being on camera there. The temperature was a bit cool but pleasantly sunny that morning; despite that, I was the only rider on the bus. The service didn’t cancel and went out as planned. The combination of the weather, daylight, and vantage point led to some great views and pictures. This might be something fun for a first-time visitor to do, as it will lead to seeing areas that you may want to explore further and not know about until you’re actually there. Another point in taking this bus trip was to end in Shibuya, as a new exhibit for the Tales RPG series opened that day. Admission is 2000Y and is expected to be purchased in advance. I didn’t know about the latter part, so I needed to buy tickets for same-day admission. The earliest time available was 3:30 PM, so I agreed to that, and now I was faced with having four hours to spend there. I had already completed a fair amount of exploring and taking pictures here on my prior solo trip, and the prior days’ worth of walking was adding up against Shibuya’s hilly area, so I didn’t want to spend too much time on my feet. Another store on the shopping list was the Square Enix Garden nearby, so I got that wrapped up, and I went to the Village Vanguard, as they previously had some Atelier RPG decorations set up in the adjacent subway hall. The Atelier decor was gone, but the Village Vanguard store itself was nicely decorated and stuffed with many goods. Now, I just wanted to sit down for a while, so I went over to the Taito Station to find something to play. IIDX was in heavy use, so I sat down in front of Bombergirl and dumped about 4000Y into it to make progress on the game and get some character item unlocks. Pine get. Back in line for the Tales museum. They offer voice guides to the exhibition for an additional 700Y, but I didn’t bother, as I personally am not a gigantic Tales fan (I’ve only played Symphonia, Xillia, and Arise; they’re fine enough, I’m just not a huge JRPG fan in general compared to other games) and I was mainly there just to see it and get some shopping done for gifts. The content itself is sparse, as there are some boxes of the games affixed to some walls, some life-size standees to take pictures with, some preproduction manuscripts that were closed up and locked behind cases, a lifesize sculpture of two characters from a scene from the first game, and that’s really about it. There are some picture restrictions, but most of it is open. Think of the 2000Y admission fee as more of a way to prevent overcrowding by the public at large, particularly since you have to walk your way through the rest of the department store building to access it. I finished the night out with a few more IIDX plays at Ikebukuro and food from the KFC at Sugamo in order to get a Monster Hunter collaboration sticker sheet. It’s been several years since I last ate chicken from the bone, and I have to say, I’m not a big fan of it. I also have to say that while, yes, the KFC here is indeed better than the KFC from home (in that the KFC in Japan didn’t completely and immediately wreck my insides), I wouldn’t say that it is at some kind of spectacularly high quality. It’s still fast food chicken.

**Kichijoji, Nakano, Skytree, Takadanobaba.**

A person I follow on social media regularly posts the exterior of the arcade he visits. The posts contain no text, so I needed to do some research to discover that it is a Taito Station located in Kichijoji. As that is right next to Nakano, and the area looked interesting otherwise, I resolved to find this location to take that same picture. I arrive as the day is starting, so I’m able to take some pictures of my favorite setting: the morning preparation as everyone gets ready to start their day. I find the location, but it is early, so I take the picture and move on. While walking around, I noticed a line forming around the block – was this for breakfast at a new restaurant? No, it was for a flea market that was just about to open! I find a place to sit down for some coffee, walk over to a Luckyland to have a IIDX play there, then get to the line for the flea market. It’s being held on the rooftop of the building and there’s about fifty vendors for a crowd of about one hundred people. Some interesting finds at good prices made for more good gifts. By the way, there is an Animate and a Village Vanguard here too. I leave for Nakano, and I don’t dawdle too much there, as I’m working my way through the shopping list, and I know that what I have remaining to do today, and what remains on the list, means that I was able to keep a tight focus on shopping. One magazine that I seek out is Gamest. It’s an arcade focused magazine that stopped in 1999, and I have its last issue among a few dozen others. The earliest issue that I have is #160, which I acquired here, and its print date is January 15, 1996. I return today and happily find more – the earliest of which is #7. Small print on the cover only shows the era date of Showa 62, so that’s 1987. I scoop that up and leave others behind, having to balance judgment of budget against availability; on one hand, it is a nearly 40 year old magazine, but on the other hand, it is 2000Y. Also, bringing back a lot of printed material quickly adds up in luggage weight. I have one IIDX play at the Adores here before leaving for Skytree, and I was only coming here to do shopping, as it has a Pokemon Center among other nicer stores. The Center itself was extremely crowded, the line for checkout wrapped within the entire store, and the primary item that I was looking to buy was already sold out. I still found some other listed items there and elsewhere, then had some shrimp ramen on an upper floor. I return to Sugamo to drop all the purchases off and look for a new place to go for evening exploration and plays. I head to Takadanobaba. It’s easy to wander into residential areas away from the main street and it is hillier than I anticipated, which I like for interesting photos. I came across a man on a bike who had stopped to feed food to some stray cats; I find it interesting that, in both prior trips, I hadn’t seen any stray cats, and this time I’ve seen a few of them. I also came across this strange building that looks like it was abandoned for years, had a cigarette vending machine on its front that was operating, but all product was sold out, and to its right was some kind of crane game to get prize tickets that was blindingly illuminated. I have some IIDX plays at Taito Station and GIGO; the conditions weren’t great at either place, but I did come across someone who was streaming while playing IIDX at GIGO. I observed for a bit, looked her up when I came home, found her channel, and eventually my wife confirmed that I can be briefly seen walking past her in the background of the archived recording as she plays. That’s now twice that I've appeared on YouTube content during this trip (that I'm aware of, at least).

*Monday, December 1.*

**Ueno, Akihabara, Ikebukuro.**

One of the requested gift items was a Go board. In my shopping so far, I only came across two types: one that’s travel-oriented, and another as part of a child’s multigame set. I wanted to get a plain, standard, dedicated Go board, and to date, this proved elusive. Also to date, I hadn’t been to Yamashiroya in Ueno, and I chose to start the day there. I arrive early and walk around near the zoo and the shrine. The zoo was closed that day, but I had only wanted to go there for the shrine anyway. At 10:00 AM, I walked to the toy store to discover that it was conducting inventory that day until 1:00 PM. So much for that. Since I hadn’t done so before, I simply walked straight south from Ueno to approach Akihabara. Kotobukiya shopping done. Melonbooks underneath HEY required two trips, because I couldn’t keep a Discord call up with my wife to have her help me point out what I should buy, so I needed to just take pictures of everything. Animate shopping done (or so I thought). Next to the new Silk Hat Akihabara. I was intrigued by it having a so-called “Bemani Studio” on its top floor, but I should have kept my anticipation in check. The Studio had two dedicated IIDX and Voltex machines for streaming, a “shrine” where you could press a button to receive a fortune, and dart boards. That’s really about it. The next floor down had 12 more IIDX machines and other games, and the basement had only ten copies of a Gundam game; the rest of the building consisted of crane games. The machines were essentially new, and the interior still smelled of fresh paint, so it was definitely nicely presentable and clean. However, its layout was actually rather small, and its contents weren’t too different from those of any other nearby arcade. I hadn’t been in the Radio Tower until now, and it had a few good finds. Shosen Tower had good finds for magazines, and I could easily spend more money there on railroad goods if I desired. Then, back over to check one last place for some games on the list from the Lashinbang and Super Potato. I had hoped to find all of my desired used games before going there, but I didn’t have luck, and they didn’t have the last games I was seeking either. However, Super Potato did have a loose copy of US Super Mario Bros / Duck Hunt for just over 10000Y. What a steal. Remember when your local FuncoLand always had a stack of those sitting around at a quarter each? Before the trip, we had been told about a location here selling deep fried sandwiches, known as SandoLab. They have both dinner and dessert sandwiches, so, before moving on, I try the standard beef and a crème brulee. It’s a good thing that I wanted the crème brulee, as all the other dessert sandwiches were sold out. I get the food and find the bread to be warm, but the filling to be a touch cold; I guess this makes it easier to eat immediately. The flavor was fine, but, given the total price of 2200Y, the quality and quantity were not equal to what 2200Y can get you at another given restaurant. Now, I had a heavy bag to carry and a desire to have an actual meal, so I return to Sugamo to drop the goods off and get ramen at Sugamoka. That’s better. I conducted some quick research on other arcades to seek out, and I recall there being a Mikado in Ikebukuro. In contrast to Silk Hat, this is an arcade that looks and smells like it has been used for years. It also didn’t have a new IIDX machine, but it did have DJ Troopers, so I gave that a spin, despite it not having a headphone port. Playing older IIDX games really puts the evolution of the series into sharp focus. I wanted more current plays so I headed to the nearby GIGO. The Adores across the street is set to close in January, by the way. GIGO has a projection display set up for Popn and IM@S TOURS, which is a nice idea if anyone played TOURS. 

*Tuesday, December 2.*

**Akihabara, Odaiba, Nakano, Takadanobaba.**

After seeing some of what was stocked at the Animate store in Akihabara, my wife wanted me to return to buy and research a few remaining things. I guess I was there early enough for them to enforce a “no video call” policy while walking around this time. Whoops. The research that had me recall Mikado in Ikebukuro had another post mentioning a retro arcade in Odaiba, and I hadn’t been in that area before. Taking the Yurikamome line from Shinbashi is recommended if you’re a railroad fan, as you can sit in the front and have a driver’s view for the trip. Odaiba Decks gives a very strong “dead mall” vibe, or at least it did when I was there. There is an area at the lower levels designated for small children to run around, and it did have few child sized arcade games set up, so that was cute. The Showa retro area upstairs had a good feel to it, and yes, it did have a few older arcade games, but this isn’t what I would classify primarily as an arcade area first, but rather a nostalgia themed area that happens to have a few old games in it. The nearby Divers building does have a standard Round1 in it, so I had a play there. Even though Decks felt deflated, this area has many nice stores and an uncongested layout, so I could see this being a great spot for a family with younger children to spend the day. After further discussion about it, I returned to Nakano to pick up Gamests #10, #16, and #17, and I also returned to one of the railfan stores in there to get an official JRE necktie for a good price. Back to Takadanobaba because I didn’t realize that there is a Mikado there, and I can confirm that it is better than the one in Ikebukuro. While there, I recovered someone’s Suica and ID cards from the station exit, I hope she gets that back. At this point in the trip, I had noticed that I was recording plays in more locations than prior trips, so now I had a new focus to try to log more of them. I also didn’t want to spend an evening in the same ward two nights in a row. As I was in Ikebukuro yesterday, I went back to Akiharabara today, and recorded plays at HEY, Game Panic, and Leisureland. Game Panic wasn’t that good; I think I had a few turntable misfires and I didn’t like the lighting. HEY felt good this time, and they did have a new set up of Darius II on a double projection screen, so I gave that a try. Leisureland was OK.

*Wednesday, December 3.*

**Ikebukuro, Omiya.**

I needed one last day for laundry, and it was available in the morning. The duration is two hours. What to do? A quick hop over to play some rounds at Ikebukuro, of course, because it’s that easy. Since it was early and nobody was around, I gave Idolmaster TOURS a try. 200Y gets you one card and one song. It has a lot of talking for character development and good presentation, but the actual play mechanics were boilerplate and that you only get one single song to play seems lacking. I think that may be a reason why it seems like I didn’t see nearly anyone else play it so far. Back to get laundry and buy some fresh dorayaki from the store across from the hotel, then off to Omiya. On the first trip, I went to Kunitachi and into a free “rail museum” there, which was just the engine compartment of an old shinkansen; it had some goods displayed and many magazines inside, so it was nice for it being free. Omiya has a proper rail museum, and other arcades there that I hadn’t logged for plays, so I went there today. The museum can handle crowds much larger than what was present when I was there at midday. Also, I came to realize that there’s only so much time I want to spend trying to read things when I’m actually there and visiting and I could be exploring new places rather than read material that I can just as easily read back home.  The fourth floor provided a vantage to see passing shinkanen had an accompanying placard to tell you the scheduled passings of the trains. I would be in remiss if I didn’t try one of their train driving simulators while I was there, but something weird happened. Prior players had a readout on screen about the speed and approaching stopping distance for the arrival, but those figures weren’t there for me. I don’t get it. The facility was well maintained, and the exhibited stock was nice to see, but three hours was enough, and I got antsy and I was ready to go to other places. I had IIDX plays at the Omiya GIGO, Taito Station, Leisureland, and Round 1. GIGO had one machine under a very bright light, Tatio’s screens felt blurry, Leisureland was good but it was getting to dinner time and I didn’t want to linger. Before heading to Round 1 I had food at the Jonetsu no Sutameshi ramen facility. When my wife and I went here, it was very good. This time wasn’t quite so good, and I’m not sure why; I ordered some karage chicken, and rather than a few meaty chunks, they served a dozen smaller bits that were all very resilient to chewing. The ramen serving and flavor seemed subpar as well. I don’t get it. By this point in the evening, the temperature had dropped, and a few drops of rain were coming, so, between that, the kind of off-putting feeling of being at the museum, some lackluster IIDX plays both while here and at Ikebukuro earlier, and the underwhelming dinner, I was feeling a bit defeated. I went over to McDonalds to have a shake for a pick me up before heading back. 

*Thursday, December 4.*

**Haneda, Hachioji, Tachikawa, Shinjuku, Nishi Nippori**

I needed a better way to spend my last full day. But, first things first, I needed to do the luggage drop at Haneda so that I wouldn’t be lugging two full pieces with me on the way out. I got that taken care of and did some last-minute research on a new place to go. A recent post asking for a good second-hand place to go mentioned going to Hachioji. I haven’t been there before, and there was a quick route from Haneda to get out there. There is a transfer from Keikyu to Yokohama line at Higashi Kanagawa, and the path connecting the two could be clearer. As it happens, a German man was making the same connection that I was, so we essentially helped each other out in getting there. Nice to meet you. While en route, I noticed many cargo trailers with US Army identifying markers at Sagamihara, and I didn’t know that there is a US base there. If I had more time to research and not move at the spur of the moment, I would have realized that the better thrift / second hand store places in Hachioji are not at the proper downtown area, but I didn’t realize that until I was there. I had a IIDX play at the Silk Hat there. There’s a hallway connecting the arcade to the crane game area between two separate buildings, and when I went to take a picture of that hallway, I had an employee X me out of it. That was strange. I think I was followed as I walked over to the IIDX machine and was left alone when they realized that I was there to actually play a round. Purchased a new Famitsu at Yodobashi, purchased a game that I saw new for 5000Y at Bic for 1500Y used at a Book Off, confirmed that any other used goods stores were miles away, so I resolved to return to World Game Circus in Tachikawa now, as it was on the way back. WGC is squarely between Tachikawa and Kunitachi, so you’re going to walk about a mile from there to either station. When I was here the first time, I didn’t go to the Tachikawa station, so I was surprised by its size. Sunset pictures on the walk from here to WGC were nice. If the arcade still has any BM3 or its Beatmania II (not IIDX) machines, they weren’t present in the store this time, so hopefully they’re just down for repairs. The interior is the full opposite of a standard national game center, and it’s lovely. Boxes, manuals, wires, panels, and other random stuff is scattered all over the place inside, and it feels like you’re in someone’s messy house. For my IIDX play, I had a sightread clear of a 12, so this was the start of an actual good session of songs, at last. Walked further east to Kunitachi station to make my final play come at Game Spot Versus in Nishi Nippori. Shinjuku comes between Kunitachi and Nishi Nippori, so I figured I’d get some pick plays while there too. I guess I can’t say I’ve had a Tokyo trip if I don’t see the cat billboard once. The Taito Station near the train station was new to me, I was surprised to find a machine with 20G springs there. The nearby Shinjuku Sportsland facility also surprised me with the quantity of newer and older games that it had. Moving on to Nishi Nippori.  When I was there before, it was early in the morning. This time, the place was well attended and activity was bustling. Some SF3 Third Strike among good players was happening on the tournament screen. I had my last plays of Bombergirl and IIDX, both of which were good enough. One last meal back by the hotel at Sugamoka ramen, and I helped myself to two bowls of rice on top of the soup. 

Friday, December 5. 

決戦は金曜日. Flight out at 10:50 AM. Over and out. On that note, the flight back was a full half hour quicker than scheduled, and I did not need to speak to anyone from customs after getting my bags. 

Conclusion.

Overall, I’m very happy with how the trip went. Having done this newest trip now, I think I have a better understanding of how I want to approach them. My language interaction was better this time than before; although still far from perfect, I feel that I was able to converse a bit more effectively, and my comprehension improved. It was only at the Tales Of museum line that a worker felt compelled to use a translator device on me (probably just to ensure that I knew what was going on, and because that attraction brought in many foreign tourists), and many people spoke with me normally through various transactions (and I believe my responses were appropriately formed and delivered). I now see myself having the most enjoyment in simply going to new places and being on the move rather than hunkering down and spending many hours in one single given place. Maybe next time, if I don’t have such a big shopping list to work with in particular, I’ll see about bringing a separate camera as well. I did make a wish at the “shrine” at the Silk Hat Akihabara.

One of the Tapes Isn’t in Our System.,"I know how this sounds, but our old 911 recordings all stop at exactly 37 seconds—only I can hear what keeps talking after that.

I listen to other people’s worst moments for a living.

There’s a windowless room in the basement of City Hall, three floors under the clerk’s office, past a “Records” sign that’s yellowed where the tape is. Inside that room: four metal shelves of cardboard boxes, one metal desk, a tape deck older than I am, a wheezing desktop PC, and a pair of headphones that still smell faintly like someone else’s sweat.

My job is to digitize old 911 calls. That’s it. I sit, I press play, I listen, I type a few notes, I hit save. Eight hours a day. Lights humming, vents coughing dust.

You do anything long enough, it turns into background noise. Including people screaming.

Car wrecks, home invasions, overdoses, arguments that end in sudden silence. I got used to it faster than I thought I would. After a week, I wasn’t hearing people anymore, just “a domestic disturbance at 19:42,” “possible shots fired,” “caller disconnected.”

Some calls still stuck with me, though. A road I drive past every morning. A kid’s voice. A dog that barks through the whole call and then cuts off mid-yelp. I kept a folder on my desktop for those and labeled it “anomalies,” like that made it clinical.

The one I’m writing about never made it into that folder.

We were midway through the 1998 tapes. Most boxes had neat dates in black marker — “JAN–MAR 98,” “APR–JUN 98.” One didn’t. No label, just shoved between them, dustier than the others.

I almost skipped it. Curiosity won.

Inside were five tapes in cloudy plastic cases, the kind that look like baby VHS boxes. Each case had a number written on it in ballpoint pen: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. No dates, no incident codes, nothing else.

I grabbed #1, slid it into the deck, and put on the headphones.

No three-tone beep like normal. Just a hiss of dead air and then a man’s voice, low and close, like he was talking right into my ear.

“Is this… working?”

Pause. The counter on the deck ticked up.

“Hello,” he said. “There’s no operator, is there? Okay. I’ll just… talk, then.”

No dispatcher. No “911, what’s your emergency.” Just him and the soft static under his words.

He sounded calm. Too calm.

“I’m in the archive room,” he said. “Basement level. Four shelves. One desk. Fluorescent lights. Smells like dust and burnt coffee.”

The hairs on my arms stood up.

I turned and looked around my own little concrete box: four shelves, one desk, flickering lights. The carpet by the door still had a brown ring where somebody had dropped a pot of coffee long before I worked there.

Common office setup, I told myself. Lots of basements look like this. Coincidence.

On the tape, his chair creaked as he shifted. It made the same high, whining sound my chair makes when I lean forward.

“I’m here,” he said, “because they told me to keep going until I hit the end. I don’t think there is one. I think someone lied.”

That got my attention. I glanced at the tape case again. Someone else’s handwriting, cramped and slanted.

“That’s all right,” he said. “I’ll just keep talking. It feels better than being quiet. When it’s quiet, I can hear it moving.”

My finger hovered over pause.

“It’s behind me,” he said. “Most of the time. Right now it’s in the corner, near the ceiling. I can hear the vents change when it moves. The air goes… different.”

Right on cue, the vent above my head rattled and coughed out a thin breath of cold air.

I told myself I was wound up from too much caffeine, nothing more. I opened a new note in the system and typed:

Unknown caller. No dispatcher. Self-referential description of archive room. Possible test recording?

On the tape, the man went quiet for a few seconds. I could hear him breathing.

Then, clear as anything:

“It’s okay,” he whispered. “He doesn’t know yet.”

I pulled the headphones off like they’d burned me.

The room was exactly the same: beige paint peeling at the corners, a scuff on the floor where a cabinet used to be, a water stain on the ceiling that kind of looks like Australia if you squint. The vent sat there, quiet.

When I looked back at the deck, the counter read 00:37.

Thirty-seven seconds.

I’d heard at least a minute. The “he doesn’t know yet” line alone would’ve pushed it over.

I rewound, hit play again, and watched the numbers. Beep. Hiss. Breath.

“Is this… working?”

He did the whole spiel. “I’m here because they told me to keep going…” “Feels better than being quiet…” up to “When it’s quiet, I can hear it moving.”

At 00:37, the tape clicked and stopped.

No “he doesn’t know yet.” No vents. Nothing.

I didn’t log anything else about it that day. I pushed it into the back of my head and did normal boxes. Car crashes, noise complaints, the usual.

That night, in bed, in the dark, I kept thinking about the creak of his chair.

The next morning, I came in an hour early.

Nobody was down there that early. The front desk lady was still unlocking the main doors when I walked past. The copy room was dark. My basement hallway was empty.

I closed my door, sat down, popped tape 1 back in, and this time I set my phone on the desk and hit record on its voice memos, too.

The tape spun. The counter ticked.

“Is this… working?”

Same voice. Same weird pause. Same room description. Same line about “I don’t think there is one.”

Thirty-five seconds. Thirty-six. Thirty-seven—

The deck clicked and stopped.

In my ears, he kept talking.

“I think someone lied,” he said. “That’s all right. I’ll just keep talking. It feels better than being quiet. When it’s quiet, I can hear it moving.”

Forty-three seconds.

“It’s behind me,” he said. “Most of the time…”

Fifty-four seconds.

“It’s okay,” he whispered. “He doesn’t know yet.”

Sixty-one.

“Not him. The next one.”

My skin went cold. I hadn’t moved. The deck was stopped. The counter frozen at 00:37.

“Don’t test me with your phone this time,” he said. “You already know it won’t work.”

I ripped the headphones off.

My phone’s memo app showed a 00:37 recording. I played it back with the volume up.

Beep. Hiss. Breath.

“Is this… working?”

It cut off mid-sentence at “It feels better than being—”

Everything past thirty-seven seconds was gone.

I left it at that. I did not touch that box for two days.

On the third day, I came back from lunch and found the unlabeled box sitting dead-center on my desk.

I hadn’t put it there.

When I went upstairs for my sandwich, the basement door was locked behind me like always. The sign-in sheet at the front desk showed no one else going down in that ten-minute window.

Could’ve been a prank, I told myself. Somebody with a master key. Some maintenance guy thinking he was funny.

I opened the box.

Tapes 2 through 5 sat lined up like little gray teeth. Tape 1 was missing.

There was another case in there, though. Same cloudy plastic, same kind of tape. The number “1” was written on it again, but the ink looked newer, darker.

I didn’t want to touch it. I did anyway.

The deck reset. I pressed play.

“Is this… working?”

Same voice. But this time, instead of listing the room, he said:

“You changed your password. That’s smart.”

My hand froze on the keyboard.

IT had made us change our passwords that morning. I’d picked something different from my usual, added two numbers that I always think about when I type them because they’re the middle of my phone number. Nobody watched me do it. The door was shut.

“I like this version better,” he said. “Eight characters. Two numbers. You think about your phone number when you type them.”

My fingers curled away from the keys.

“Don’t test me with your phone this time,” he said. “You already know it won’t work.”

I took the headphones off, set them down, and went upstairs to tell my supervisor I had a migraine.

Back home, I unplugged my landline and turned my cell off. I still heard his voice when I tried to sleep. Not the words, just the rhythm. The way he paused, like something else in the room had to finish breathing first.

The next morning, the unlabeled box was back on its original shelf when I came in. Tape 1 sat in its spot like nothing had changed. If you’d walked in fresh, you’d think it had never moved.

I didn’t touch it.

I spent the morning on boring calls. A neighbor’s loud music. A drunk guy who kept insisting he needed “the number for Domino’s.” A kid whispering into the phone until his mom caught him.

At lunch, I ate at my desk. When I looked up from my sandwich, the tape deck’s red counter was lit.

00:37.

The power light was off. The deck wasn’t even plugged in.

I walked around the desk and checked anyway. The plug was lying on the floor. I’d unplugged it the day before and never put it back.

The counter stayed on.

That was it for rational explanations.

I plugged the deck back in with shaking hands. Sat down. Put the headphones on.

Silence.

Then a breath.

“I don’t have much time,” the man said. Closer this time. Like he’d moved from the far end of a hall to right beside me.

“You’ll get curious,” he said. “If not today, then tomorrow. Or next month. Or the day your brain’s tired and you forget why you were scared. You’ll put in the second tape. You’ll listen to the third. You’ll wonder how far it goes.”

I looked at the box. 2, 3, 4, 5.

“You’re not the first,” he said. “We all think we’re smarter. We all think we’ll listen a little and stop. That’s how it gets inside the room.”

Something creaked behind his voice — that slow, complaining sound of metal under new weight. My own chair answered it when I shifted.

“It likes us listening,” he said. “It likes the attention.”

My tongue felt dry. “How long have you been there?” I asked.

He gave a tired little laugh.

“You’ll see,” he said. “If you keep going.”

There was a rustle, like he’d turned his head.

“It’s behind you,” he whispered.

My shoulders knotted up. I stared dead ahead at the wall in front of me: the crack near the baseboard, the embedded paperclip, a faint scuff mark from somebody’s boot.

“You’re going to be tempted to turn around,” he said. “Just to prove there’s nothing there. You’ll do it fast, like ripping off a bandage.”

The vents hummed. The air felt thicker, like it had weight.

“I did that,” he said. “I don’t remember what I saw. I remember the sound. It was like something stepping into a body and realizing it fits.”

My grip tightened on the edge of the desk until my fingers hurt.

“I don’t want to make another one,” he said quietly. “But I can’t stop you. All I can do is warn you.”

The counter still read 00:37.

“You’re wondering why it doesn’t show up,” he said. “Why the recording cuts off when you play it anywhere else. Why you can’t prove this is real. Why nobody complains about noise from down here.”

He was hitting every thought I’d been trying not to think.

“It doesn’t like being recorded,” he said. “It only likes being heard.”

The vent above me coughed. A pocket of cold air slid down the back of my neck.

“You can leave,” he said suddenly. “Right now. Stand up. Walk upstairs. Tell your boss the tapes are corrupted, request a different assignment. Quit. Move. Smash your headphones. Forget my voice.”

There was a pause that went on long enough I thought the call had dropped.

“You won’t,” he said finally. “You already put the first tape in. That’s how it starts.”

Static thickened around his words, like a crowd pressing in.

“I have to go,” he said. “It’s closer now. And you’re going to—”

The sound cut.

Not a click. Not the usual mechanical stop. Just a hard edge of nothing.

I pulled the headphones off and stood up. The room swayed a little. My hand went out toward the door automatically.

All I had to do was grab the knob, open the door, walk out. Tell someone upstairs there was an issue with the old equipment. Ask for IT.

I took one step.

Behind me, my chair creaked.

I hadn’t touched it.

The vent above my head exhaled. The air changed again — not colder, not warmer, just wrong. Like walking into a room you thought was empty and realizing someone was already standing there.

My hand hovered a few inches from the knob.

In that dead quiet, over the blood rushing in my ears, I heard the faintest sound.

Tape moving.

Not in the deck on my desk. Somewhere higher. Somewhere behind me. The soft, dry spin of spools turning.

A voice came with it, almost too soft to catch. Close enough I could feel my skin pull tight between my shoulder blades.

“Don’t turn around,” it whispered. Same man. Same tone. “Please.”

I’m writing this at home, later. On my own laptop, with no tape decks in the room. The city doesn’t let us take physical media out of the building, so the only thing I brought with me is whatever I remember.

If you’re waiting for a clean ending, I don’t have one.

I don’t remember turning the knob. I don’t remember walking to the elevator. I don’t remember what my supervisor said when I signed out. There’s a ten-minute gap between my last logged call and my signature on the clipboard.

I check my ceiling vents a lot now.

They rattle at night when the heat kicks on. Sometimes it’s just metal expanding. Sometimes it’s just air.

Sometimes, when it’s very quiet and I’m lying there staring at the dark, I swear I hear a tiny click and the soft spin of a tape that never hits the end.

And every time that heavy, wrong air settles at my back, one question keeps bothering me:

Did I really walk out of that room on my own?

Or did I already turn around, and whatever stepped into me is the one making sure I keep listening?",1,1765040384.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

My father (M 44), let’s call him Tommy, is helping me pay for college. Now I feel terrible for not doing more, i feel like i’m not doing enough honestly. He pays for my apartment at the school and the courses. He also pays for my phone bill, my tech, my xbox, my credit card, the fucking air i breathe— people would be so grateful to have him in their lives and i am but it always comes with a price. I discovered in earlier of this year that he was cheating on my step parent for over a year and that he was paying off his affair with money he could’ve used to pay for my schooling. I want to feel bad but then you do this. When i found out i was in total shock and to be fair embarrassed. I waited for like a week for him to come out and tell the story himself but when he did I was high as hell the entire time, this was on facetime mind you. After the conversation he sent me 200 dollars which i took. I go out of town every summer to see that side of my family and he was telling me he didn’t want me to go over because of the mass tension but still wanted to see me. 

Now i had heard many of their arguments in person with my sister but never this crazy. I won’t get into specifics but i will say when i went on our annual vacation things blew up as soon as we got there. I’ll fast forward to a few months ago where I had mentally been checked out given the entire situation and tensions in the house, I was offered to go on a one-on-one lunch with Tommy bcs my stepmom wanted us to keep our “bond” and not let me shut him out completely as i continue adulthood. We go to this lunch and i tell him a list of things that bother me. The type of person he is..for example me and my sister were talking about going to an arcade. He says Oh well you got games at home, yall play those all the time. Or when we were planning where our next trip would be at and he was talking about going to an island. I said oh well it is this season so we might get caught up with some weird weather and he was like no we should still go and worry about it later. Or at our recent vacation we were in a restaurant and looking for stuff to do. He says “i’m a planner and we should figure stuff out” but then my sister and stepmom chooses to do a boat tour and i have to find something for me and him to do and he asked why we had to figure it out then. 

During the lunch i expressed my concerns about how im not the same person as when i was 12, i shouldn’t be compared, my feelings should be validated even when he says his, he holds money over my head, and he goes “I wish you could’ve told me this on your own”, “i didn’t even wanna do this or come to this lunch”, “i feel like the bad guy”,  “you should be putting more effort into this relationship”. I pretty much clocked out and I was looking for if he was really even hearing me. He feels like his feelings or opinions are never heard. 

Another thing he was buying things to try and make up to my stepmom for and for example, after that lunch we go to get ice cream for the family coming back. He asks me what my stepmoms usual order is or what she likes and i tell him. He says a different answer and then calls her there on the spot to verify and she tells him exactly what i had originally said. I know her favorite flowers, her coffee, etc. Even my sisters favorite things, he doesn’t know us as people. For christmas last year i didn’t ask for much and i don’t ever, and I got some headphones which i love btw. The other year i got a pet rock as a joke from him and my sister got a cat calendar. While my brother got all those toys. I didn’t keep the rock. he got us others he just made us open those first as a joke. For a lot of gifts i write him letters bcs i feel like he’s not thankful for gifts i actually buy for him. I bought him a cologne he wouldn’t shut up about and some personalized bracelets. For father’s day me and my sister built him a robot filled with gifts as you opened it and i think he threw it away by now. 

There’s so much more honestly but im tired of writing.

Ive heard stories from when i was little that i fell asleep in the pool. I had fell asleep in the middle of an exam while writing something mid-sentence. Fell asleep in a crowded restaurant. I always fall asleep in class through out high school. In church since forever, like within 2 minutes of sitting down. No matter what i do, coffee, prior naps before my service (i go to a morning service, so i woke up earlier, get ready, try to tire myself out, then take a nap and wake up as close as the service time as possible), go to different service time, even had a lollipop, but ive only ever succeeded like a handful of times (ard 5 times)

Last semester i felt like the sleeping is interfering too much with my study so i went to a neurologist/neurosurgeon. He ordered mri to rule out other condition, told me it was narcolepsy.

The thing is, i also have ocd. And he said its probably the ocd medications. He said i probably have some underlying condition, but the ocd meds is exacerbating it. He told me to talk to my psychiatrist to lower down the medication

I talked to my psychiatrist, and he didnt believed me🙄🙄 he said that it was a very rare diagnosis, he ended up lowering the dose after i insisted bc i couldnt go on. But then he asked me, oh do u have cataplexy? Because narcolepsy diagnosis needs cataplexy. I did not know what cataplexy was. Then he explained. I said no, and i felt he kinda did not believe me but lower the dose anyways.

But after i got out of the room. DAMN I REALIZED SOMETHING. I’ve always been known in my family to be someone who falls ALL THE TIME. Like there was a period where I’d have a falling injury every month. I used to always have first aid kit for fall injuries. And any time someone fell they would ask me what to do cause im known for falling down all the time.

Moving on, i was too scared to say that to my doctor (idk why im just anxious to tell him). Then after awhile i changed doctor cause i finally got an appointment at the public hsopital. On my second visit my doctor wanted to increase the dose again, i said no, but he insisted, and after awhile of back an forth, i finally gave up. 

I followed the prescription for 3 days before i stopped because the sleepiness was very debilitating. I would fall asleep while standing in the middle of my lab session. But my next appointment is in 3 months. Im currently taking half of my dose (which is less than the orginial dose) so the ocd is flaring up, (but not that bad)

Yea so now im stuck with 1 doctor telling me to lower the dose for my ocd meds, and the other wanting to increase the ocd meds🫠",1,1765040132.0,Narcolepsy,4,0.99,False

So I am reaching out to people on this subreddit for some guidance so that I could perhaps not struggle as much setting up my life in Nelson. 

I have never even been to NZ so I have been trying to understand how everything works in your neck of the woods from renting a place to buying a car, choosing a phone provider and setting up a bank account. Also I have been trying to get accustomed to your accent, which is a... an interesting journey!

So what should I know about living in Nelson? What are the nicer parts for living? Anywhere you reccommend for me to stay while looking for a place and attending viewings? Anything to look out for when siging a lease/buying a car? Where to buy essentials? I saw that IKEA opened in NZ, so if all else fails, lol. Anything else?

And perhaps someone would like to share the knowledge of the area or show me around? Stuff like good spots for walks, nice nature spots (probably everywhere), historic sites, main streets, where is the best coffee and where to get great food?

8 servings – 90 minutes (+ 90 minutes rising time + 20 minutes baking time)

INGREDIENTS

For the cinnamon roll dough:

300 g all-purpose flour (or spelt flour, type 603)
50 g sugar
75 g vegan butter
150 ml plant-based milk
8 g fresh yeast
0.5 tsp salt

For the cinnamon roll filling:

100 g vegan butter (room temperature)
50 g brown sugar
2 tbsp cinnamon

For the cream:

400 g vegan whipping cream
200 g powdered sugar
16 g (2.5 tbsp) cream stabilizer
600 g vegan mascarpone
2 tsp vanilla extract

For the soak:

60 ml espresso
100 ml vegan punch (e.g., Voelkel)
2 tbsp Amaretto

Additionally:

1 tsp cinnamon
1 tbsp cocoa powder

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Take the vegan butter for the filling out of the fridge and let it soften at room temperature.

2. For the dough: Sift the flour into a large bowl. Add sugar and vegan butter. Warm the plant-based milk until lukewarm, dissolve the yeast in it, and add it to the bowl. Knead everything for about 8 minutes into a smooth dough. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes. Then knead in the salt briefly and let the dough rise again for 1 hour, until doubled.

3. For the filling: Mix the brown sugar and cinnamon, add to the softened butter, and combine well.

4. Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Roll out the dough into a large rectangle. Spread the cinnamon filling on top. Roll the dough tightly from the long side into a log. Cut into 0.5–1 cm slices and place them on the baking tray. Let them rise for another 15 minutes, then bake for 15–20 minutes at 180°C (fan). Let cool completely.

5.For the cream: Whip the vegan cream together with powdered sugar and cream stabilizer. Gradually fold in the vegan mascarpone and vanilla extract. Chill.

6.For the soak: Mix espresso, vegan punch, and Amaretto. For an alcohol- or coffee-free version, replace with more punch.

7.Assembly: Cover the bottom of a 20 × 30 cm baking dish with cinnamon rolls. Drizzle 3–4 tablespoons of the soak over them. Spread a layer of cream on top. Repeat the layers until everything is used up. Extra cinnamon rolls make great decoration.

8.Mix cocoa powder and cinnamon, then dust over the tiramisu through a fine sieve. Decorate with remaining cinnamon rolls.",15,1765040061.0,traaaaansbiansCooking,2,1.0,False

Usual Dinners: 
Mex: bean and cheese quesadilla 

Indian: chickpea/lentil type dish

Greek: falafel and hummus 

I try to be healthy during the day bc my weakness is at night:  

Pretzels, crackers, pop corners or tortilla chips, and a sweet treat like a handful of Cinnamon Toast Crunch lol (hence the user name coffee and carbs) 

Is my nightly snacking causing this? 

I am a normal weight 130-135 but gained 10 pounds in past two years. I have been unusually stressed for the past four months.

If you like it and it makes you want to read more. 

# [Chapter 1 – Home Again, Damn It]()

Daisy Lou Harper arrived fifteen minutes late to her aunt’s funeral wearing the only black dress that hadn’t been through her divorce—though even this one had suffered its share of courtroom air‑conditioning and pity stares. Biscuit, her beagle, panted in the passenger seat like a tiny metronome of judgment as the First Baptist Church of Willow Bluff came into view. White steeple. Crooked shutters. A marquee that read:

WELL, FROM DUST TO GLORY — THANK GOD FOR A GOOD SWEEP

“Jesus also doesn’t have to sit through this,” Daisy muttered, easing the car onto the grass where overflow parking had spilled past the gravel. Biscuit gave a soft disapproving whuff. She scratched his ear. “I know, bud. We’ll be quick. And polite. Mostly.”

Inside, the sanctuary felt like a time capsule dipped in humidity. Stained glass poured the morning light into guilt‑colored patches across the pews. Ceiling fans spun with the energy of a genteel faint. The congregation was half full, half fanning, and entirely judgmental. Mathematically, that checked out for Willow Bluff.

Reverend Blake St. James was mid‑eulogy, voice moving at a molasses crawl that still somehow sounded sincere. Daisy hovered by the back doors—balancing grief, tardiness, and the dread that comes from returning to a town that remembers your worst haircut and your messiest breakup.

“Effie Harper told the truth even when it blistered,” the reverend said. “She left behind a home full of stories, secrets, and maybe more tea cozies than one woman needs.”

A polite ripple of laughter. Daisy spotted her mother near the front—Delilah Harper, hair immaculate, spine so straight it could slice pie crust. Delilah didn’t turn. She didn’t have to. Disapproval in Willow Bluff traveled fine without eye contact.

Daisy slid into the last pew. Biscuit, smuggled under her arm like contraband, hunkered at her feet. A row ahead, she caught the broad, familiar line of Sheriff Bo Ramsey’s shoulders where he stood along the side aisle, hat in hand. He’d been a few years ahead of her in school—quieter than the boys who loved their reflections, steady as an oak. Not someone she’d dated. Just someone she’d noticed.

Biscuit’s nose twitched. He crept forward and, with a cautious curiosity that earned him exactly three inches of leash slack, sniffed the scuffed toes of Bo’s boots. No growl. No bristle. Just one thoughtful sniff and a slow tail tip, as if cataloging something important for later.

Traitor, Daisy thought, and then, softer: good judge of character.

Across the aisle: Tucker Barnes, old prom date and current reminder that choices at eighteen should come with refunds. Same golden tan. Same smile like he heard applause only he could hear. Luanne wasn’t with him, but her cloud of hairspray and bad ideas seemed to linger anyway.

Daisy’s gaze snagged on Trudy Valentine near the middle—rhinestones winking on her cat‑eye glasses, already composing tomorrow’s gossip buffet in her head. Beside her, Leona Barnes, queen of committees and thinly veiled compliments, sat with a prayer book held like a gavel. When Leona noticed Daisy, she offered the kind of smile that came with conditions.

The organ sighed toward a hymn. Daisy’s throat tightened unexpectedly. Effie had been the only person who could make a casserole taste like absolution and a scolding sound like a blessing. The idea of this town without her felt… unbalanced.

After the final amen, the congregation drifted toward the parlor for the communion of ham biscuits and passive aggression. The air smelled like coffee, lemon bars, and hairspray that could stop a small bird mid‑flight. Biscuit trotted neatly at Daisy’s heel, receiving two unauthorized pats and one righteous endorsement from an elderly deacon.

Trudy intercepted her at the punch bowl with the precision of a seasoned traffic cop. “Well, well. If it isn’t Atlanta’s most eligible divorcée. Welcome home, sugar.”

“I moisturize with regret and bourbon,” Daisy said, taking a paper cup.

Trudy’s smile sharpened. “Effie talked about you every Wednesday at choir. She said you were stubborn as a bulldog and twice as loyal. A woman after my own hymnal. Also—” she lowered her voice “—word is the mayor’s office still hasn’t closed his file. Makes a gal wonder what other things this town misplaces.”

“Word is you start the word,” Daisy replied.

“Somebody has to take attendance on the truth,” Trudy said primly, then softened. “Effie was one of the good ones. Didn’t let me feel small. That’s rarer than a sincere bake sale.”

Delilah appeared like a cold front, black dress crisp, lipstick bulletproof. “You are late.”

“I’m here,” Daisy said. “And I brought my own beagle; I assume the church is BYOB.”

Delilah’s eyes flicked to Biscuit, then back to her daughter. “You know I don’t hold with animals in the Lord’s house.”

“God made beagles on a good day.”

Delilah’s mouth twitched—whether amusement or dismay was anyone’s guess. “Your aunt wanted you to have the shop.” She said it like a judge handing down a sentence. “There are papers. Keys. Don’t go wandering the private rooms with your big city carelessness. Effie kept boundaries.”

“I can respect boundaries,” Daisy said.

“You’re excellent at crossing them,” Delilah corrected, then, after a beat, squeezed her forearm in a brief, startling flash of tenderness. “Eat something. You look thin and dramatic.” She breezed away, already mid‑conversation with a deacon’s wife who’d worn pearls like armor.

Sheriff Bo sidled over as the crowd thinned. Up close, the years had settled on him like experience, not weight. Lines at the eyes. A calm that made other people tell the truth by accident.

“Sorry for your loss,” he said.

“Thank you,” Daisy replied, keeping her tone neutral. It was easier than acknowledging the memory that tried to rise—Bo at Effie’s back porch once, returning a stray pie plate, listening like listening was his second language.

Biscuit sat squarely between them, looking from Bo to Daisy like he’d joined a committee. He gave Bo’s boot another curious sniff, then rested his chin on Daisy’s ankle as if to say, This one’s alright.

“I heard you inherited Past Tense,” Bo said, nodding toward the direction of town.

“That’s the rumor.”

“You opening it back up?”

“Eventually.” Daisy lifted her chin. “Today I’m focusing on not crying in front of people who’ll write it down.”

A corner of his mouth tilted. “Fair.” He tapped the brim of his hat and stepped aside as Tucker oozed into her path like a bad penny.

“Didn’t think you’d come back,” Tucker said, smile fully dimed.

“She was my aunt,” Daisy said. “I didn’t realize attendance required your permission.”

“I was being friendly.”

“You should try another hobby.” She shifted, and Biscuit obligingly placed his paw on Tucker’s shoe—light, deliberate, like a quiet warning dressed as cute.

Tucker looked down. “You always had taste in dogs.”

“And phases,” Daisy said sweetly. “Some of us grow out of both.”

She made her escape before he could summon a memory and call it a compliment. Outside, the heat wrapped her like a damp shawl. She buckled Biscuit in and pulled away, letting the familiar streets roll under her tires like a film she’d watched too many times.

Willow Bluff hadn’t changed so much as doubled down. She passed the mayor’s office with its unblinking blinds; the gift shop shaped like a watermelon; the high school football field where she’d cried under the bleachers after prom—dress hem grass‑stained, lipstick smudged, Tucker’s apology as thin as breath. A block later, Sweet Beans came into view.

A chalkboard outside shouted OPEN MIC NIGHT! HALF‑OFF HORCHATA! In glitter pen beneath: Hosted by Stella Rae Monroe. Daisy’s stomach did a small unwilling flip.

“Of course she runs it now,” she muttered. She’d never officially met Stella Rae, but a decade of small‑town adjacency had taught her the Monroe brand—big hair, bigger opinions, and a talent for curating gossip like a Pinterest board.

Through the café window she caught the corkboard by the door—a collage of lost‑cat notices, Scripture study invites, and brightly printed flyers. One neon rectangle snagged her eye: THE RUSTY RAIL—LIVE THURSDAYS! Someone had doodled a tiny train in the corner. Daisy registered it, filed it under *things that would matter to other people*, and kept driving.

At the next corner, the Magnolia Street sign leaned a hair to the left, as if even the posts had secrets. Beyond, up on the ridge, the old Delacroix estate slumped beneath a cling of ivy and rumor. Effie used to say that house had an appetite. The magnolia roots under it, too.

When the whitewashed facade of Past Tense finally appeared through the live oaks, Daisy’s hands tightened on the wheel. The shop—half home, half museum of other people’s memories—looked like it had been in mourning. Paint curled at the edges. Porch swing listed like a tired sigh. The hanging sign swayed gently, the T in PAST slightly cracked, as if the word were trying not to break.

“Well, kid,” Daisy told Biscuit. “Here we are.”

He whined once—a soft, empathetic sound—then wagged his entire rear end as if to say, *Onward*.

The front steps creaked like they remembered her weight. The key—a thick brass thing Effie had sworn by and never replaced—turned with a stubborn little click. Inside, the air was cool and familiar: lemon oil, lavender sachets, and something underneath without a name. Not rot. Not mildew. Just oldness. Time clinging to wood and wallpaper.

Past Tense had always blurred the line between parlor and shop. Victorian loveseat under a tower of teacups. Hall tree bristling with umbrellas that had never seen rain. A glass case of costume jewelry that had outlived three marriages and one embezzlement scandal. Effie curated history the way other women curated church hats—decisive, opinionated, and with no patience for counteroffers.

On the entry table sat a linen napkin embroidered with a tiny gold daisy—Delilah’s handiwork. Tight stitching. Tighter judgment. Daisy touched the corner, then let it go, like handling a hot thought.

Biscuit trotted ahead, tail level, nose working. He paused at the threshold of the hallway—ears lifted, body angled, the dog equivalent of a raised eyebrow.

“What is it, Scooby Junior?” Daisy whispered.

He huffed once and glanced back at her, then lowered himself, belly close to the floorboards. He inched forward, nose toward the old crawlspace door Effie kept latched with a hook and a prayer. His tail went still. Not tucked. Not wagging. Focused.

“Don’t do that to me,” Daisy said, half‑laughing, half‑listening in spite of herself.

She flicked the hall light. It buzzed awake with a mean little whine that made the hair on her arms prick. For a second, all she heard was the hum of the bulb and the faint clink of the porch chain tapping the railing outside.

Then—

A dull thud from below. Not the scamper of a raccoon. Not the delicate patter of a possum argument. A single, heavy sound, like something shifting where it shouldn’t. The floorboard under her palm vibrated a breath later, subtle as a heartbeat.

Biscuit’s head snapped toward the sound. A low, instinctive growl rumbled in his chest, more warning than threat.

Daisy stilled, listening. A second sound followed—fainter this time. A drag? A settle? Pipes sometimes talked in old houses, Effie always said. But this didn’t sound like water finding itself. This sounded like gravity reconsidering its options.

She could walk away. She could call Bo and hand him this moment like a hot pan and let him carry it, and maybe that would even be wise. But Effie hadn’t raised her to be wise first. Effie had raised her to be thorough.

Daisy unlatched the hook. The little metal groan carried like a whisper in a quiet church. She wedged her fingers under the crawlspace door and lifted. It protested, then gave—

—and the smell hit her like a hand over the mouth. Earth. Damp wood. A sweet, rotten undertone that wasn’t exactly death and wasn’t exactly life. Daisy gagged and turned her head.

“Okay,” she said hoarsely. “That’s… not a possum.”

She thumbed on her phone’s flashlight. The beam jittered along rough joists and old brick piers. Biscuit pressed against her calf, a living weight anchoring her to the hallway.

Something blue caught the light. Plastic. A tarp, crumpled and shoved toward the back corner, the edge gritty with dirt. Beside it, the cracked arm of a pair of reading glasses jutted from the soil like something tossed in haste.

Daisy’s stomach rolled. She let the door drop gently back into place, the latch swinging like a pendulum.

“Effie Harper,” she whispered, throat tight. “What did you do?”

She stood there a long moment, listening to the house breathe. Somewhere outside, a windchime struck a single note and went still.

Biscuit nudged her hand with his nose, and she realized she was shaking. She sank onto the hallway runner, pressed her palm to his warm side, and tried to assemble her thoughts into something that didn’t feel like panic.

Call Bo, a sensible voice suggested.

Call Mama, a reckless one dared.

Daisy exhaled. “We’re not doing either until I sit for sixty seconds and pretend I’m the kind of woman who keeps chamomile in the pantry.”

She made it to thirty before movement in the front window pulled her gaze—just a shadow shifting past the lace curtain, there and gone. Curiosity pried at fear. Daisy stepped into the parlor and peered through the filigree.

Across the street, Eunice Mayfield stood behind her rosebushes with binoculars she thought were subtle. Daisy lifted a hand in a small wave; Eunice dropped like a startled squirrel.

Daisy almost laughed. Almost. The sound that came out was thinner than she liked.

She crossed back to the entry table and straightened Effie’s brass magnolia paperweight, the one that always listed a little left. “Okay,” she told the house. “Here are the rules. I am brave. I am broke. I will make tea. And I will not open that door again tonight.”

Biscuit sighed. It sounded like agreement.

On her way to the kitchen she paused by the front window again. The Sweet Beans chalkboard was just visible down the street if she leaned. THE RUSTY RAIL—LIVE THURSDAYS! winked from the corkboard behind the glass. Stella Rae’s glitter signature glowed like a dare.

The magnolia outside scraped the siding with a slow, steady touch—fingers on a drum. Effie always said the tree remembered more than people did. Daisy had chalked that up to poetry and stubbornness.

Now, with the crawlspace latch still warm from her hand and the tang of damp earth in her nose, the line felt less like poetry and more like a warning.

She took Biscuit’s face in both hands and looked him in the eyes. “Tomorrow,” she said. “We call. We dig. We deal.”

He licked her thumb like a signature.

Daisy set the kettle on, pulled down a chipped teacup Effie had favored, and leaned her forehead against the cabinet door while the burner clicked toward flame. The house creaked—a settling, a sigh, a reminder that even empty rooms keep score.

If there was something terrible under her floor, the past had found her address.

And somewhere in the quiet between the kettle’s first murmur and its whistle, Daisy swore she heard her aunt’s voice, low and wry as ever:

*“Welcome home, baby. Keep your eyes on the magnolia.”*

I've had gut issues for about 7 years now, gut dysbiosis, low level of SIBO. I've had bloating and pain for a while after inflammatory foods/fodmaps, but nothing in the colon/lower left area really. That was until I had a course of Metronidazole/Flagyl in December 2024 for a gum problem. As soon as I finished that course, I began to notice this nagging pain in the lower left of my abdomen and it has never gone away, only gotten worse. I wish I had never taken the stupid antibiotics. I swear I will never take them again, unless I'm on my death bed and it's the only thing that will save me.

Every single night I get in bed there is the pain there, burning, spasming feeling, around the anus and bottom of the colon. Made worse by sitting or laying down especially. It's almost constant but usually better after a bowel movement/in the morning, when I stand up etc. It feels like lumps around that area but I've been to the doctors, had blood tests, stool tests and a CT scan. All showed absolutely nothing wrong but I swear this has to be diverticulosis/ diverticular disease. I was booked in for a colonoscopy but I cancelled at the last minute because honestly I was frightened (silly thing to do I know).

I will confess I have a bit of a coffee/caffeine addiction which isn't helping but it's the only thing that can help me cope with this miserable situation. Coffee is flaring it a bit, protein/heavy meals seem to flare it. I can barely eat anything because fodmaps flare it, carbs, protein etc. I'm going crazy and think ill just fast for a day soon just to help the pain.

I've done private stool tests and OAT test to show biochemistry, and worked with a practitioner. My tests weren't actually too bad, showed I have some low levels of Hydrogen SIBO, some low beneficial bacteria such as butrayte etc, and high levels of C Perfringens which is usually found in uncooked meat. I'm trying to deal with all this but killing off the bad always flares up the pain badly and trying to boost butrayte levels with PHGG causes pain too. It's a horrible situation to be in and I don't know what to do. I'm always paranoid I will get cancer too and have to have a stoma. Its terrifying and i don't want to live like this anymore.

  
Some people have told me it might be Visceral Hypersensitivity and that's true. I do have a very over active nervous system and immune system. Even drinking hot water seems to spasm my colon and flare it.

So here’s the thing, I woke up at 6:30, drank one coffee and chugged a glass of water so would have time to use the restroom before the race.

Felt like my legs and lungs were good to go, but my bladder said no. What do runners do before a race? Don’t drink at all beforehand?

I go to sleep around 11pm, wake up around 7 during workdays, 9 during weekends. The problem is that every single day throughout the whole day I just feel extremely tired / gorgy. For some reason then between 7-9pm I feel the most energetic. 

For me to have a productive day I just need coffee, but for me it wears off extremely fast (I feel gorgy around 2h after a full cup of coffee).   
  
I of course heard about maybe it's reliance, I de-cafed for a month last year, it resulted me just being even more tired throughout the day.

I have genuinely tried everything, during week-ends I have tried to close all the blinds and I could sleep around to 12 in the morning, though when I wake back up, I feel even more tired (the overslept feeling).

Years ago my sleep was normal and I was not this tired during the day. Right now I feel like I can do around maybe 30-50% of my productivity of my 7-9pm peak productivity during the day. I don't think I have had flow state during the day for an extremely long time

I have tried melatonin, all sort of supplements, none of them work on me.

I do have a weird habit of waking up around twice / once a night to use the bathroom, but I don't think that's the cause.

1pftphp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1pftphp/the_one_brain_hack_that_fixes_sleep_mood_energy/,"The ONE Brain Hack That Fixes Sleep, Mood & Energy (Backed by Neuroscience","We’re living in a world that’s chronically tired. Almost every friend I know is either wired at 1 a.m., relying on caffeine by 10 a.m., or hit with a weird energy crash around 3 p.m. Sound familiar? The weirdest part is, so many of them think this is just “normal adult life.” But after diving into some serious neuroscience rabbit holes (spoiler: most TikTok “sleep hacks” are trash), I realized there’s one painfully simple routine that’s been hiding in plain sight.

This post is for anyone who struggles with poor sleep, low energy, afternoon brain fog, or even anxious thoughts. I pulled this from world-class neuroscience research, sleep experts, and health podcasts, not from some influencer who drinks celery juice and calls it science. The best part? This habit takes 10 minutes max. And it works.

Let’s start with what most people ignore.

- Dr. Andrew Huberman, Stanford neuroscientist and host of the Huberman Lab podcast, has been shouting this from the rooftops for years:  
  > “Get natural sunlight in your eyes within 30 - 60 minutes of waking. It’s the single most powerful anchor for your body’s circadian rhythm.”  
  Yeah, turns out morning sunlight isn’t just a “vibe.” It literally sends a signal to your hypothalamus saying “Yo, it’s daytime, get moving.” No sunlight, no real wake-up signal…and your brain stays in limbo.  
  This light-driven signal starts an internal 16-hour timer that tells your body when to produce melatonin (the sleep hormone). So if you’ve ever felt “tired but wired” at night or randomly exhausted during the day, your circadian clock may be completely misaligned.  
  
- A 2021 study published in the journal Sleep Health found that people who got natural light exposure within the first 2 hours of waking reported better sleep quality and improved mood, even when controlling for screen time, exercise, and caffeine use.

- Another study out of the University of Colorado Boulder (Wright et al., 2013) showed that spending just a weekend camping, aka resetting your light exposure patterns, moved participants' internal clocks back by 2 hours and improved melatonin timing. Sunlight isn't just helpful. It's the entire foundation.

So here’s the actionable stuff. No fluff.

- Start with this habit tomorrow:
  - As soon as you wake up (preferably between 6 and 9 a.m.)
    - Go outside for 5 to 10 minutes. No sunglasses.
    - You don’t need direct sun, even on cloudy days this works.
    - If you wake up before the sun, get outside once it's up. It still works.
    - Window light does NOT count. Has to be direct outdoor light.

- If you live at higher latitudes in winter:
  - Consider using a 10,000 lux light therapy box (Verilux and Carex make solid ones).
    - Use it for 10 to 15 minutes shortly after waking.
    - Stay within 12 - 18 inches of it.
    - Eyes open, but don’t stare into it like a psycho.

This habit alone has changed so many things for people: better sleep without melatonin, less afternoon crashes, reduced anxiety. And it's free.  

Now if you're the type who wants to geek out and build a whole morning stack around this (like optimize mood, dopamine, energy) here’s what I’d recommend adding:

- After your sunlight:
  - Do 2 to 5 minutes of light movement (stretching, jumping jacks, walk around the block)
    - This spikes cortisol (in a good way) and starts your energy curve for the day.
  - Delay caffeine for at least 60 to 90 minutes after waking.
    - Why? Adenosine (the sleepy chemical) hasn’t cleared yet.
    - If you slam coffee right away, you just mask it. Then crash later.
    - Dr. Matthew Walker (sleep scientist and author of Why We Sleep) has backed this habit too.

- Optional: cold exposure
  - Cold shower or splash your face
  - Activates the locus coeruleus (part of your brain that regulates alertness)
  - Even 30 seconds works. Not mandatory, but it’s like natural Adderall for some people.

If you wanna go deeper (books, podcasts, apps that actually help), here’s a short list of GOATed resources:

- Books:
  - **Why We Sleep** by Matthew Walker  
    Bestselling sleep science book by UC Berkeley professor. Won the NAS best science book award. This completely changed how I viewed rest, health, and performance. This book will make you terrified of sleep deprivation but in a good way. Zero fluff, all brain candy.  
    > “This book will make you want to sleep 8 hours every night like your life depends on it. Because it literally does.”

  - **The 4-Hour Body** by Tim Ferriss  
    Say what you want about Tim, but his breakdowns on light therapy, sleep tracking, and morning cortisol spikes are insanely actionable. Best for the biohacking-curious crowd.  

  - **The Circadian Code** by Dr. Satchin Panda  
    He’s a leading researcher at the Salk Institute. This book explains how time-restricted eating and light exposure rule your biology. After reading it, you’ll never eat a bagel at midnight again. 

- Podcasts:
  - **Huberman Lab**, Especially his “Sleep Toolkit” episode. Pure gold.  
  - **FoundMyFitness by Dr. Rhonda Patrick**, She dives deep into sauna, light, fasting, all with heavy research backing.  
  - **The Drive with Dr. Peter Attia**, Slightly nerdier. But the best longevity + metabolic health content out there.  

- YouTube:
  - **Ali Abdaal** has some surprisingly good deep dives on morning routines and circadian optimization.  
  - **Andrew Huberman** uploads full lecture-style videos breaking down the neuroscience of energy, alertness, and resets.

- Apps:
  - **Rise Sleep App**: Tracks your actual circadian rhythm based on your sleep debt and wake times. The first app I’ve seen that actually aligns your productivity with your internal clock.  
  - **BeFreed**: A personalized audio learning app that’s kind of like Duolingo meets MasterClass, with a super smart (and weirdly motivating) avatar. It was built by AI experts from Google and Columbia, and recently went viral on X for good reason. You tell it your goal, like improving sleep, anxiety, productivity, and it generates podcast-style lessons from books, expert talks, and research papers.

    I’ve been listening to a 15-minute deep dive on circadian rhythms and another one on dopamine cycles, while walking in the morning sunlight. It also adapts to what you highlight or ask mid-lesson. Honestly, it’s helped me actually stick with habits because the info feels so tailored and fun. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me.  

  - **LUX Light Meter (iOS or Android)**: Tells you if your morning lighting is strong enough. Surprisingly helpful. Aim for 10,000 lux exposure.

One more thing: morning sunlight also boosts dopamine and sets the stage for better mood regulation. According to research published in the journal Neuron and highlighted by Dr. Huberman himself, light exposure modulates dopamine neurons in the brain’s reward system, which helps explain why morning light = better mental health and motivation through the day.

So yeah. Fixing your life might really be as simple as walking outside and staring at the sky. Kind of wild.",2,1765039487.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False

I was pretty disappointed by my experience with the 2025 season. All of the coffees had amazing stories, but the roasted coffees were mid. Most of them were just not that interesting to drink. Neither neither sweet, nor subtle, nor funky, nor bright. Just kind of middling. 

You’d expect a “COE producer’s Gesha with special processing” would lead to an outstanding cup, but that just wasn’t the case.

I think Christopher needs to bring a stronger point of view to the roast next year, and strive for more distinctiveness in the cup.

I'm considering taking the Amtrak line from either DC or Baltimore (I live right between the two), to West Palm Beach to visit family for the holidays. I usually fly but my experience lately has been awful, and incredibly stressful!

It's about a 22 hour trip. I can bring things on the train to keep me busy no problem. Videogames, books, and all. However, I have Adhd and need to get up and stretch at times. Is there any car/space where I can stand up by a window from time to time (and not bother people of course, I have public decency)? How are the lounge cars? I'm the kind of person that likes to go to coffee shops and read books. Is it comfy in that regard? I don't expect luxury. For reference I think spirit airlines is pretty fine, but this is also much longer travel time.

So I just bought the 3 Total War Warhammer titles on sale yesterday and litteraly spent like 8 hours straight on my first play with Kislev! First of all, I understood the appeal right away!

Second, I had a couple questions:

Been trying to do a Siege but can't understand why they don't let me build Siege Units, my army is full so tell me if that's the reason.

Every time I play a battle, my armies really get a lot of casualties even if I got a big advantage on paper. For example, I rushed a Khorn Lord with all my armies and they got melted, then there reinforcement showed up..
So if you have tips would be appreciated

How does Multiplayer Campaign work? Do you all need to be connected at the same time? Been seeing there was a couple going on in the browser.

Lastly if there's a Discord to play with people and ask more questions, hit me up!

I feel so unmotivated and tired all the time. I went through a divorce a decade ago (he cheated on me with one of my friends), I had a very serious health condition a couple of years ago, and I still have some not-so-serious health issues.

I am unmotivated for work (I work in the IT industry) and can't take the bullshit no more. Every word my management says is a nice wrap around an empty box. I don't ask for a promotion, I don't ask for a raise, I know how hard it is to be competitive and I feel their pain, but I should not be a victim, no one should.
​Looking for another job is an endless round of CVs and interviews I am really good at, but I guess my age doesn't do me a favour (55). ​And even if I find another IT job, I am afraid I would feel the same after a while...

I am using antidepressants and doing therapy but I feel the only way to really live my life would be to do something completely different. But being so desperate, I don't know where to start... I used to be a problem solver, enthusiastic about life, I enjoyed books, traveling and coffee with my friends. And now I am so lost.

Anyone there who used to be in my shoes and managed to get back on their feet? What would you advise me to do? I am losing my self-esteem and starting to think I am just a lazy old lady.

Hello all! I’m looking for recommendations for a variety of roasts to find out what I like. Yes, I think I should already know, but don’t. I’m almost 70, have preferred mostly lattes, like the general taste of Tim Horton’s Original Blend medium roast. 
I just purchased and tried Super Crema using the Alan Alder Regular Cup recipe with flow control/paper filter combo and don’t like it. I’m thinking it’s too dark roast for me.
Rather than spend a lot trying different beans, I’d like to get a variety pack is small quantity bags. Any recommendations?
Some background:
For the last year or so, my coffee hasn’t tasted as good as I’d like. I’ve used a Ninja coffee bar with Tim Horton’s or sometimes Starbuck’s Expresso roast, but increasingly, it tastes more swamp water-like. I don’t get it and would think it’s me that’s changed, but I still love Starbucks flat white, for instance. 
I tried various milk alternatives, whole milk, shelf-stable milk, not much luck. Usually, ice coffee tastes better to me than hot, but I want to enjoy hit coffee again. Weird, huh?
I use filtered water (good quality refrigerator filter). There is no local coffee roaster.

i was a live in nanny for almost 2 years and it wasn’t terrible but i got taken advantage of. it started out decent i would come over to help straighten the house out while kids were at school and took care of the little one that stayed home. i was given 150 each day and after the first two weeks, i heard the mom and dad arguing over pay. the mom informed me we’ll have to go over budget and what they could afford and instead of daily pay it’ll be weekly, that’s fine ofc. however she didn’t really touch on the pay and when i asked for the money at the end of the week, she gives me an envelope and says that’s the best they could do. $200.. i was annoyed but she convinced me to eventually move in and i figured okay, im new to the state and i dont have to sleep on my sisters couch anymore, why not. the pay stayed at a flat $200 for the whole 2 years, occasionally it would vary up to $300 and if it was more it was because she signed me up to care for other kids. 
the run down of my hours and what i did: 7am-8pm. mon-fri and saturdays got the kids ready and finished tidying up before leaving, sundays i would come back and have to put the kids to bed or watch them for a few hours (even tho those 2 days were my off days). i woke the kids up and got them ready for school, took the oldest to school, came back to watch the little one, cleaned the house (dishes, laundry, the parents bathroom and their room, the kids rooms, the patios, the upstairs that she rented out (the people renting literally could’ve cleaned it themselves idk why she sent me up there to do it), kitchen, floors etc.), took the dog to get groomed, cleaned the airbnb before rotations, picked the kids up from school, took them to appointments (there was one or two literally every day), did hw with the kids, took them to the park or to the animal sanctuary, cooked every meal (even for the parents and made their coffees and teas), showered the kids, put the kids to bed, did personal care for mom (eyebrows, nails, hair, etc.), grocery shopping, ran errands such as returns and paid bills, literally you name it i did it !!! i even played chef when they had parties or family over, i would cook nice big meals literally everything. she would advertise looking for kids to watch as if she cared for them, but pawned them off to me and went to her room AND didn’t even split the pay right. there were plenty of times i’d watch her 3 on top of another 2-5 kids alone and nothing in return. (she threw in my face she picked up watching kids to pay me more. i hardly saw that money and SHE DIDNT WATCH THEM????) when her mom came, i would take her everywhere and catered to them all. 
there were numerous times she didn’t even pay me at all, i would leave for the weekend and ask for the pay and she’d say “oh i forgot to tell you we don’t have the money for you this week” AFTER i did everything. it was just a slap in the face. meanwhile i was juggling full time school. i was torn because i did get close to the family especially the kids and saw them as my own family, the kids like my siblings and i figured they housed and fed me so thats one less thing to worry about, but after talking to other moms who had live in nannie’s and other live in nannie’s i was informed i was a family assistant and should get way more even if i were live in. i was sticking it out until i went back home for school, but the last 2-3 weeks of being there she didn’t give me anything not a dime. it was just a slap in the face because how do i do all that work and bust out practically 70 hrs a week???? i decided to quit as i was fed up and just annoyed, i have things to pay for and even after all the hours and work i put in, i wasn’t given a livable wage? she tried cutting corners (the reason for me moving in) anyway she could. when i left she again threw at me that they fixed my car (i couldn’t afford it because i was getting $200 a week, that’s $800 a month. my car payment and insurance is $800 together 😃) and that she picked up kids to watch to pay me extra (i told her she didn’t watch them, i did and i didn’t even receive money from it most of the time???) she wanted me to do HHA classes so that the state would pay for “childcare”. again full time school, watching the kids, practically the made, and now you want me to juggle more school work??? on TOP of that, she wanted me to give her rent or pay 3 bills when approved for HHA to “help her out” even though i got done grimy??? she didn’t pay me accurately for 2 years and wants me to give her funds for rent or bills???? outrageous. when i initially met them they said they couldn’t believe the one kid was diagnosed with autism and that “the ny doctors know nothing” blazzy blah, i informed them half my family is autistic and it’s nothing bad? she back pedaled and now she uses the “my son has autism” card ik shocker !! 
now she’s made a post to the page i found her on and guess what she’s offering? 21-27/hr plus overtime. a mf slap in the face. i’m hurt because i loved the family and the kids so much, but come on??? $200 a week for 70 hrs, plus watching extra kids and not being paid for it???? 

edit : i forgot to mention, i even had a friend who helped occasionally and she would sometimes get paid more than me !!! 🤦🏻‍♀️ or not pay my friend at all, she ended up pulling back and doesn’t communicate with the family anymore (i do not blame her) they try to ask her for help and she just ignores them.

Lane - Cozy Fantasy (72,000 words) - March 2026","In a modern-day San Francisco where magical creatures and monsters live openly among humans, Oddie Saltbrook, a witty yet anxious merman florist, has carved out a quiet, comfortable life on land. His days are simple: make sure Rosalind, his distractible mothkin coworker, actually shows up (and stays focused); grab coffee from Lily, his human best friend and secret crush, at the café down the street; and keep his boss’s beloved flower shop, Maple Street Florals, running as retirement looms. 

Life may be small, but it’s safe — and it’s his.

That is, until a secretive real estate tycoon sets their sights on the neighborhood. What seems like a straightforward corporate buyout soon reveals layers of strange magic and dangerous secrets lurking just beneath the surface.

To save his job and prove his worth to his traditional underwater family, he’ll have to embrace the magic, face down a mysterious threat, and risk everything, including his heart, for a future he can finally call his own.

Sea Blooms is an 72,000-word adult cozy urban fantasy set in modern-day San Francisco, where magical beings live openly among humans. It will appeal to fans of *Legends & Lattes* and *The House in the Cerulean Sea*, with its mix of found family, a wholesome romance, and lighthearted magic.

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/49fnw8/me_24f_my_roommate_23f_and_her_bf_25m__he_snores/)  **March 7, 2016**

Okay, I don't even know where to begin.
My roommate (Claire) is good friend of mine and has been since college. Her boyfriend (Mike) is a good guy for the most part. I like him, but it's one of those situations where they aren't a good couple. 
They always get in silly fights and are constantly annoying each other. It's weird because separately, they're great, but together, they aren't the best couple.

I'm super busy during the week (full time job + full time grad student + hobbies) so I'm usually in bed pretty early. We have a small apartment, but since Mike works close by he always ends up at our house. It's a little annoying because he really is there almost every night, but since I'm not around too much (basically to sleep and eat) I try not to rock the boat. Like I said - I like him and she's a good friend and roommate, so I figure pick your battles. But there's one big issue - HE SNORES SO FUCKING LOUD. Like, legitimate log sawer. So loud.

For whatever reason it just really started bugging me last night. I usually can ignore it, put on some netflix or something, but last night I couldn't sleep and was getting really frustrated so I decided I should say something because he really is at our house a lot and it's definitely not the first time his snoring has kept me up. I opened her bedroom door and said, ""Hey Mike - sorry, but you're snoring super loud!"" And that's it. I didn't berate him - I know it's not something you can really control. Plus, he's overweight, so that definitely doesn't help. It stopped and I thought that was the end of it.

Claire leaves earlier than I do and Mike usually sleeps in, so when I got up in the morning I was just minding my own business making my breakfast and prepping my lunch. I don't think I've ever seen Mike get up when I'm up in the morning, but this morning he came into the kitchen when I was milling around. I was surprised to see him and joked, ""Good morning sunshine!"" And he started screaming at me.

Not joking, straight up YELLING at me. He called me a bitch, said I was super rude and condescending, said how disrespectful it was for me to wake him up when I was doing the same thing to him now (apparently me making breakfast IN MY OWN HOME and waking him up is an issue)?? I was super freaked out and immediately just left - he's a big guy and Claire has mentioned he has a temper, so I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know how to broach the subject with Claire. I'm staying late to do some homework, but also because I don't even want to go home. How should I even approach this? My mind is so jumbled I don't even know how to formulate the right sentences.

**tl;dr:** My roommate's boyfriend is over all the time and his snoring keeps me awake. I finally said something and he freaked out on me.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

> I'd suggest setting up a time to discuss this with your roommate, and let her know that not only is her boyfriend, who's not on the lease a disturbance to your sleep, but he screamed at you and made you feel threatened in your own home, and tell her that you're no longer comfortable with him staying the night - ESPECIALLY when she's not home.

**OOP**

>>Thanks for putting it this way. She's a great person and friend, so I'm pretty sure she'll be on my side. It's just such a bummer because I did like Mike. He was cool, but this is the definition of uncool. Thanks.


[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/49p1wi/update__me_24f_my_roommate_23f_and_her_bf_25m__he/)  **March 9, 2016 (2 days later)**

Wow, okay, so a lot has happened since my post. First things first – I got a lot of heat for “entering” her room without knocking – damn people, it wasn’t like that at all. Literally did the 2-3 courtesy knocks, opened the door all of 3 inches so I could say something and left. It wasn’t like I barged in to scream at them. I didn't even go inside. If I didn’t open the door a crack, he wouldn’t have heard me. Besides, she’s one of my best friends and we’ve lived together before. She’s not some Craigslist roommate with whom I have no relationship, so this wasn’t some extreme breach of privacy. I’ve tried earplugs, but I can’t sleep with them comfortably. Literally the only way to get someone to stop snoring is to wake them up and since I’m not in bed with them and can’t tap or nudge him, that was the only thing I could do. And after months of dealing with it and trying to be cool about it and multiple night-after-night sleepovers, I was a bit fed up with our third roommate who doesn’t pay rent keeping me up. I’ve done the texting thing. I’ve done the “accidentally” knock the wall thing. It’s that bad that I’ve tried numerous things to get him to stop. He knows he snores really loud, but doesn’t wear the strips or do anything to help control it. I know it’s something you can’t control, but what am I supposed to do if I can’t sleep? So that’s that and I regret nothing. So no, I’m not “super rude” for courtesy knocking and slightly opening my close friend’s door to let her boyfriend know his overstayed welcome snoring was bothering me for the umpteenth time.

Anyway, I’m happy to report this is a very positive update. Luckily things happened pretty quickly because it was a fairly urgent issue. I ended up staying super late at work to finish some homework, so that was a good thing because A) I got a shitload of stuff done and B) It gave me some time to cool off, gather my thoughts and figure out what to say. I gave her a call because I thought texting would be a bit complicated. I wanted to ask if we could talk about something when we got home and she said she already knew what I was going to say, which made me nervous. So I said this isn’t a conversation I wanted to have completely over the phone, but hear me out. I explained what happened and I said something like, “Look Claire, I love you to death and I want you to be happy, but I cannot have Mike in our home. He really scared me this morning.” She immediately started crying and asked me to come home, so I left right that instant.

When I got there, she said he’d texted her earlier saying weird stuff about how we got in an argument (there was no argument because I didn’t really say anything) and that I was out of line (?) She was going to text me about it, but knew I was super busy and figured she’d just ask me about it when I got back from work. Once she heard how bad it was, she felt awful. I guess he’s been really verbally aggressive to her as well lately. Like I said, she’s mentioned he has a short fuse and a temper, but she’s done a good job of hiding how bad it really is. I guess it’s gotten pretty bad, which made me start crying because I love her dearly and it made me really sad to hear about how much she’s hurting. So she totally agreed he had overstayed his welcome, but also had no idea how I felt because I didn’t say anything. It was my bad that I was just internalizing my anger about the situation instead of being honest about it, but I’m glad that wasn’t a point of contention. We didn’t have to compromise about it because she knew she wanted out – this was just the final straw.

So we talked for about 2 hours about the plan of attack and how she needs to get out of the relationship. I’m glad we were able to talk openly about it and that she felt comfortable discussing it with me. Like I said – I knew they had some issues, but I had NO idea it was this bad. Apparently there’s been lots of yelling and minimal happiness. It’s her first serious relationship, so she said she assumed this was normal after you’d been together for a fair amount of time. But she was also embarrassed and didn’t want to discuss it with me because she knew I would be worried, which is 150% correct, although I wish I would’ve known obviously. So she made a plan to meet him in a public spot and break up with him. I said that I would be supportive in any way she needed me to be, so she asked me if I could drop her off and pick her up when it went down. I was really apprehensive about that because I didn’t want to run into Mike or make the situation worse, but since that’s what she wanted I was happy to do it.

So yesterday evening I dropped her off down the street of a coffee shop and ran some errands nearby waiting for her call so I could grab her when she was done. After an hour she called me and asked me to pick her up. She sounded fine! I picked her up down the street and we drove back home. She said it went surprisingly well and that he felt bad about everything, which shocked me. He agreed that it hadn’t been working out and although he tried to plead to get her back, she wasn’t having it. To be honest I was absolutely shocked! I didn’t anticipate him being so calm and level-headed about it. And while I was still a little freaked out about what happened the other day, her situation was much direr than mine and I’m obviously not holding my breath for an apology or anything, nor do I really give a shit. 
Although Mike seemed to be okay with the situation, we notified the landlord ahead of time of what happened just in case he ever returns to stir shit up. I really truly hope it doesn’t, and I don’t think he will, but better safe than sorry I suppose. I’m just glad she’s okay and that I don’t have to deal with his craziness and loud-ass snoring anymore. I slept like a baby last night without him there, and plan on sleeping like a baby again tonight.

**TLDR:** Claire and Mike are done, he was surprisingly cool about it, no more snoring!

One of them directly claimed you could [earn money shopping online](https://app.shopback.com/wD0xHbqj7Wb). And here is my problem, community: getting a small return for a necessary purchase seems like a reasonable and responsible step to avoid overpaying. But doesn't the mere act of using such a mechanism - even at the most basic level, constitute unspoken consent to consumer culture? Does it encourage my brain to look for a ""discount"" or ""benefit"" when I should just buy one thing and be done with it?

I feel this is a moral dilemma.. Which outweighs the other, the practical benefit or the unspoken endorsement of the system?

Anyway...

New Horizons is the best Animal Crossing game when it comes to customising your town... but it is missing  many of the seemingly small things that make the AC series great. The dialogue is very bland and repetitive, which makes the personality types of the animals no longer  unique how they used to be. Writing letters is also no longer important, when it used to be a very crucial thing to develop friendships with your animals. The museum also no longer displays information about the stuff you donate. It just says the name of it and the date you donated it and that's all. The Roost is just a place to get coffee. You can't work as a barista trying to guess what the villagers are trying to order like in New Leaf anymore. Flowers also don't wither anymore, which means there's zero consequences if you never water them.  

Also, the fact it relies on updates instead of base game content held it back, especially since the last major update was some years ago already with a new one coming soon just because of the Switch 2. And the reliance on updates  also means it will basically be pointless to replay many years in the future since Nintendo will no longer update it. Meanwhile, you can still buy the GameCube AC game and enjoy all of its content perfectly fine. As for more modern games, New Leaf seems richer in content than NH still.  

I checked my island for the first time in over 2 years yesterday and I don't feel like I missed anything. Honestly, Nintendo needs to work hard to give us a better AC game for the Switch 2.",3,1765038148.0,AnimalCrossing,20,0.64,False
1pft5wy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pft5wy,I ate at 4 Michelin-starred restaurants in Makati,"I’m a Filipino-Canadian who was visiting on vacation a few weeks back and wanted to treat myself. I was fortunate enough to get seats at Helm, Toyo, Celera, and Hapag. 

I’ve dined at several starred restaurants in Canada, Spain, the US, Hong Kong, and Japan. In my opinion, three of the ones I went to in Makati are deserving of their stars. I even thought Helm and Toyo were better than the 3-star resto I’ve been to.

## Helm
It was my favourite of the bunch. I got the tasting menu and a wine pairing.
**Price**: ~11,500 PHP
**Notes**:
- I did not know what to expect for the food. I just knew they were billed as contemporary. I was surprised at the incorporation of some Filipino flavours. As well as the sourcing of their ingredients, like the tuna from Mindanao.
- Favourite dishes were: beef tartare with tendon chicharon, sourdough with butter and pork fat, trout with carrot and tabang talangka, chawanmushi with blue spirulina, and tuna kinilaw with radicchio.

- Probably the best wine pairing I’ve ever had.
- Desserts were ok, nothing mind blowing but I was satisfied with them.
- As a solo diner, I had counter seating so I had a great POV for most of the plating. Service was perfect for me; it was attentive and stuffy. Somewhat personal - they very much acknowledged I’m from Canada and were intrigued to find out I was actually born in Pampanga because I don’t look Pinoy at all, so that led to some great convos. I got to talk to Chef Josh a ton as well. We bonded over tabang talangka and he told me he’d love my dinner at Toyo.
- I think if you wanna feel like you’ll get your money’s worth, Helm would be the choice because they do use some more expensive ingredients like caviar and Wagyu. On top of the food being very, very good!

## Toyo Eatery
And Chef Josh was right! It was my second favourite meal. I had the tasting menu and a juice pairing.
**Price**: ~9250 PHP
**Notes**:
- Toyo was the #1 resto I wanted to go but I struggled to find a seat on Tock. I kept looking though and got lucky.
- I really enjoyed the food since I’m a huge sucker of farm-to-table. I really appreciate the use of local ingredients because all that expensive can be flown in and enjoyed anywhere. I want something more unique.
- I did some dishes a tad bit too salty. And some of the juices a bit too sweet, but I very much enjoyed it overall.
- My favourite dishes were: sourdough-battered shrimp with sawsawan, pritong isda, leche flan ice cream, halo-halo, and a buro wrap.
- They had some of the best desserts I’ve tried at fine dining restos. The only I would for sure rank above Toyo’s desserts was a sweet potato ice cream at Sushi Noz in NYC.
- Chef Jordy was there and actually served the bahay kubo dish to me, but didn’t even talk to me at all. Like, zero words. Felt odd since he seems so open and charismatic in some videos I’ve seen. But it’s ok naman. Because the rest of the staff were phenomenal! One of the staff grew up in Pampanga so we spoke in Kapampangan most of the time. That’s how I ended up getting the buro wrap - it was an off-the-menu thing and they made it just for me because I simply asked if they were serving buro that day. I also ended the meal taking like 7 shots of lambanog while chatting with another server about which coffee shops I should visit. And they even gifted guests with a tiny bottle.
- I really appreciated how informal and lax the environment is there. They were blasting a lot of Hev Abi, which I liked.

## Celera
I actually discovered Celera through Reddit. I did the Discovery (tasting) menu and a juice pairing, plus as additional cocktail and coffee.
**Price**: ~9500 PHP
**Notes**:
- I tried getting a reservation before I landed at NAIA, but they randomly messaged me saying they had availability so I took the opportunity. I find it odd that you have to email them for a reservation. Really wish they used one of the many booking apps available.
- I really enjoyed the food overall. I thought the juice pairing went really well with all the dishes too. This juice pairing was better than the one at Toyo. Flavours were more unique and the juices weren’t overly sweet.
- Favourite dishes were: duck and chicken meatball with strawberry, lobster laksa, shokupan, and risotto.
- Desserts were ok, nothing particularly memorable.
- Speaking of, in my experience, it’s customary to get a free coffee with dessert and I was surprised to find out I had to buy one. Granted, it was a really great pour over and one of the best I had on my trip but come on…
- I found service to be very good as well. I had a chance to speak with Chef Queenie a few times and she, like most people, was surprised to find out I’m Pinoy. But to her, it was because of my accent, not my looks - thought that was kinda funny. The beverage program manager was also a delight to talk to. The servers I felt were a bit intimidated at first because I’m a foreigner, they seemed less open with me compared to the tables next to me. But once they found out I’m Filipino, at least one of them opened up more and we had actual conversations.
- I will say Celera has some of the most beautiful staff I’ve seen in fine dining establishments, both FOH and BOH. 
- I also got a couple free shots of sake as I was leaving, so that was nice. No actual tangible gift though. I really like taking menus as souvenirs and in most places they just gift it to you. I did ask for it and they obliged but kinda surprised they don’t give them away de facto.

## Hapag
Honestly, kinda forgettable. I had the tasting menu and one cocktail.
**Price**: ~8000 PHP
**Notes**:
- One of the most gorgeous restaurants I’ve ever been to. The service was also outstanding - the were super personable and we even cracked some jokes together. Unfortunately that’s where most of my praise goes to.
- Favourite dishes: inihawan course, pomelo salad, and the chocolates.
- I really do appreciate their storytelling and their mission: to give the spotlight to lesser known cuisines of the Philippines. At this time, they are highlighting Western Mindanao. 
- The food was good, nothing was bad. None of the dishes were particularly memorable. I would give them another shot though.

It was a spontaneous trip and I feel very fortunate I got seats at these establishments. I would go back to all of them next time back I’m in Makati and my budget allows for it. But if I had to only choose one, it would be Helm, with Toyo as a very very close second.",18,1765038140.0,FoodPH,6,0.95,False

They have a nice cafe area and a large conservatory. I chose a desk and set up my laptop and was watching a recorded lecture. One of the members of staff comes over after about 20 minutes and says they are really sorry but they will need the room for a venue soon and would I mind moving. Absolutely no problem. I smiled and said of course, just finished writing up a sentence and then moved to the smaller lounge section. There's a few tables in here but it's not quite as good a place to study as the chairs are all sinking arm chairs and the tables are low coffee table style. I did sit at a big table because I needed some space. I had my laptop open with my lecture playing, my a4 notepad I was taking rough notes on, and my a4 written-up notes that I was also referring to. After about half an hour a woman came over and started gesturing at me. I took my headphones off and she said really abruptly that I'd have to move as there was three of them. She gestured over to a table with two armchairs on it. I said I wasn't really happy about that as I was using the whole table space - a larger rectangular table - and didn't really want to squash onto a smaller circular table. Her friend came over and said ""well it's either that or we'll just all sit with you"" and plonked her purse and keys down. I gather the original woman was already quite annoyed that the conservatory had been closed for a function. I kind of just accepted defeat at that point. It took two trips to move all my stuff and in between moving my laptop and my books the original woman actually picked up my bag off the chair and handed it to me. There was two lots of two seaters available so they could have in theory moved one of the armchairs around the smaller table (which was still plenty big enough for their three coffees). I finished the rest of my session on the cramped smaller table but felt a bit miffed at how rude they'd been. On reflection I think I might have been happier to move if they weren't so abrupt and rude about it. I was using the whole space and had chosen that table to fit my needs better. I did manage on the small table but had to my secondary notes away and use the tracker on my laptop rather than the mouse which is a bit more cumbersome. I get that I don't own the club and to be considerate of others but that goes two ways surely? What's the verdict? Should I gave just sucked it up?

Edit - table I was sat at was a large rectangular table with two, two-seater armchairs facing each other. So it was a space intended for a larger group. The two tables that were free were to round coffee tables with two, one-seater armchairs facing each other, but there were several free single chairs that could have been moved over to make this a space for three.",0,1765038128.0,AskUK,48,0.38,False

1pft4eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pft4eo/first_week_ever_gear_and_experience_review/,"First week ever, gear and experience review - Bambino Plus / Encore ESP","Ventured into espresso making last week after 10 years of drip coffee and buying espresso shots locally. Gamechanger. I'm about 30 shots in. Maybe 5-6 sour / bitter shots that had me grimace, but I still got my fix. Decided to post about my experience and maybe grab some feedback / pointers as this is considered an entry level setup:

Gear:

* Breville Bambino Plus
* Baratza Encore ESP
* Digital Kitchen Scale - measuring in grams

Beans:

* No roast date: Costco, local grocers, etc
* Roasted date: Dogwood (minnesota based)

# Breville Bambino Plus

* I purchased this machine after having it on my radar for about 3 months... I check Best Buy every few days or so and one random morning I found an open box deal for $125 !! - 1 hour away from me. Seemed like it was a pricing error as it's normally $500 but it was missing the dual wall cups, drip tray and portafilter. About $70 in parts total? Ordered replacement parts from Breville directly. Still a crazy good deal. Can't believe I found it.

**Pros:** 

* Makes espresso

**Cons:** 

* The drip tray comes disconnected far too easily. I wish it latched to the machine properly
* I have to brace the machine from moving in order to remove the portafilter. A one handed technique would be much more pleasing. This is my biggest gripe. The one reason I look forward to upgrading to something more heavyweight in the future.

# Baratza Encore ESP

* Grabbed this machine at a small discount using AMEX cash back offers through Sur La Table. -- Sur La Table is a 1/5 star company as far as I can say, they don't allow baratza products to be directly discounted and they send far too many emails. I recommend buying this machine second hand locally as I think the MSRP is a little high for a grinder to be honest.

**Pros**

*  grind range for espresso and drip coffee with a big enough hopper to accomodate

**Cons**

* noisy? it's a grinder what should i expect
* plastic housing that feels a little cheap, this is the reason I will upgrade to something more heavyweight in the future

# Experience

I've been brewing about 3-5 shots a day.

All my shots (double) are at grind setting #18 and weighed at 18g. I wanted to keep it consistent this way. 18-18 just felt easy. (Baratza recommends #15 for espresso)

Breville explicitly states to use the dual wall cup when using beans with no roast date.

Since I'm using basic beans from Costco, ill follow Breville instruction. I got some pretty good results to be honest. -- Only times I got a sour shot was when I used beans that seemed to be slightly too moist or I felt like I tamped too hard. Is that a thing? Wasn't sure how much pressure to use. One thing I noticed was that I could never tap the puck out of the portafilter with these beans. I always had to scrape it out with a spoon. I brewed about 25 shots with the dual wall before I went out and bought some beans with a roast date. 

Using beans with a roast date I used the single wall cup - per Breville. Gamechanger. I might just put the dual wall cup in the cupboard for good. Immediately noticed better results. I can taste the coffee flavor profile and the puck tapped out with ease. I'm 5/5 for shots with fresh beans on a single wall. 

I use the default factory setting on the Bambino Plus (I don't cancel the shot pour prematurely, I let it finish it's course) Shots start brewing after about 12 seconds and pour for about 20 seconds. Produces anywhere from 35-44g shot, I'm guessing this varies on how hard I tamp? I think my data will be different now that I am utilizing the single wall cup exclusively.

Anyway that's all for now. Pleasantly happy with these results. Haven't had drip coffee in over a week and I don't miss it.

1pft33y,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pft33y/navigating_dating_apps_are_they_worth_the_effort/,"Navigating dating apps  are they worth the effort, or just a source of frustration?","I've been on and off dating apps for a while now (mostly Hinge lately), and I keep asking myself: is this actually helping me meet real people, or am I just trading emotional energy for a pile of half-conversations and awkward first dates?

Quick rundown of my experience: Hinge feels like the ""serious"" app on the surface  prompts, longer bios, that whole *designed to be deleted* vibe  but even there the signal-to-noise ratio is wild. I’ll get a thoughtful match, we’ll vibe for a few messages, then it fizzles with a single emoji or a ""busy this week"" reply. Other times the profile photos are either clearly from 10 years ago or look like they were taken on a potato. And don’t get me started on the “let’s grab coffee” texts that turn into plans two months later and then vanish.

What I like:

* You can actually filter and try to be intentional. Hinge prompts at least give you something to talk about besides ""sup.""
* There are moments when it clicks  one convo turned into a great date, and that reminded me why I keep trying.
* It’s nice to meet people outside your usual circle, especially if you’ve exhausted your social pool.

What drives me nuts:

* Ghosting is now a national pastime.
* So much time gets eaten by matches that go nowhere. Swiping, crafting a message, waiting... repeat.
* It’s mentally tiring to always perform  write witty openers, curate photos, calibrate tone  like dating turned into a part-time job.

I also worry about how apps change the way we approach dating. There’s so much emphasis on immediate chemistry and checklists that I wonder if patience and curiosity get lost. On the flip side, if you’re not actively meeting people otherwise, apps are simply a tool  and tools are only as good as how you use them.

My strategy now: be picky about who I spend time on (if someone’s replies are one-liners after two messages, I move on), try to set a rule to meet within a week or two if there’s interest, and treat it like a numbers game without letting it define my self-worth. Also, I delete the app for a week or two every so often to avoid burnout.

So  fellow daters is the app game worth it for you? Have you had success on Hinge/Tinder/Bumble, or is the frustration more real than the romance? Any tips for staying sane and not turning into a professional swiper?

I decided to learn French in 6 months.

A while ago I watched a TED talk that claimed anyone can learn any language in 6 months, and it also mentioned that the most common 2,000 words cover about 90–95% of everyday conversations.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0&t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0&t=2s)

That idea stuck with me.

So I built my own study plan:

* **1,800 real-world example sentences** (generated with Gemini and then manually curated)
* **2,000 core vocabulary words** (to hit the 90–95% comprehension range)
* **180 days × 3 hours/day = 540 hours**
* **Daily target: memorize 10 sentences + 20 words**

**My Goal:** Go From Zero to A2/B1 Conversational French in 6 Months
