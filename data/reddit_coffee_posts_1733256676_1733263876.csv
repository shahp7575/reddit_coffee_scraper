1h5zlum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1h5zlum/how_questioning_your_thoughts_can_change_your/,How Questioning Your Thoughts Can Change Your Life: The CBT Approach,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that’s been a game-changer for me. A few years back, I was stuck in a loop of negative thoughts. You know, that nagging voice that tells you you're not good enough or that things will never get better. After attending more therapy sessions than I can count (okay, over 50!), I stumbled upon a concept that flipped the script for me: **Not all our thoughts are facts**.

Sounds simple, right? But let me tell you, internalizing this idea was like discovering a superpower. It's a core principle of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**, and it revolves around the notion that our thoughts can be distorted by cognitive biases. For example, ever catch yourself jumping to conclusions or catastrophizing a situation? That's your mind playing tricks on you.

One morning, I remember spilling coffee on my shirt right before a big meeting. My immediate thought was, ""Great, the whole day's ruined."" But then I paused and asked myself, ""Is this thought a fact or just my mind overreacting?"" Spoiler: It was the latter. By questioning that initial reaction, I saved myself from spiraling into a bad mood.

So how can you apply this in your daily life? Here are some steps that worked for me:

1. **Catch the Negative Thought**: Pay attention to moments when you feel a shift in your mood.
2. **Challenge It**: Ask yourself if this thought is based on facts or assumptions.
3. **Reframe It**: Replace the negative thought with a more balanced one.
4. **Practice Regularly**: Like any skill, it gets easier with practice.

An interesting tidbit I learned during my psychology studies is about the **""negativity bias""**—our brains are wired to focus more on negative experiences. It's a survival mechanism from way back when everything was trying to eat us. Knowing this helped me understand why I gravitated towards negative thinking, and that it wasn't just me being ""broken"" or anything.

**Now, for those who are looking for resources to delve deeper:**

* **""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David D. Burns**: This book dives deep into CBT techniques and provides practical exercises to help you manage your thoughts.
* **The Happiness Lab Podcast**: Hosted by Dr. Laurie Santos, it explores the latest scientific research on happiness and well-being. I found episodes on rewiring negative thought patterns particularly enlightening.
* **LePal App**: In line with the CBT approach of challenging negative thoughts, I've been using LePal, an app created by a close friend of mine from Google. She's a woman in tech who faced severe depression and wanted to help others who might be struggling. The app features a ""spirit pet"" that makes the journey less lonely. It offers guided journaling where the spirit pet responds to your entries with insights, helping you question and reframe negative thoughts—just like in CBT. The ""therapy planet"" provides 24/7 support, allowing you to talk about your feelings and work on restructuring your mind. Plus, the weekly letters summarizing your growth really motivate me to keep going.
* **""I Am"" App**: This app sends daily affirmations to help shift your mindset. I love how customizable it is—you can set reminders throughout the day to keep positive messages front and center. The affirmations cover various aspects like self-esteem, stress, and relationships. It's a small addition to my routine, but these uplifting messages make a big difference in maintaining a balanced outlook and reinforcing positive thought patterns.
* **Insight Timer**: I've found this app more enriching than Headspace or Calm. It offers a vast library of free meditations and talks from teachers worldwide. What sets it apart is the community aspect—you can join live sessions and connect with others on similar journeys. The diversity and depth help me stay present and mindful, which is crucial when catching and challenging negative thoughts. It's been a cornerstone in developing a meditation practice that complements my CBT techniques.

Remember, it's okay to seek help and use the tools available to you. Changing the way you think doesn't happen overnight, but each small step makes a difference. If you've been struggling with negative thoughts, give some of these techniques a try. You've got nothing to lose and so much to gain.

Feel free to share your experiences or resources that have helped you. We're all in this together.

Take care!

Title card- We Pretend it's called wine time

HELLO! How are you? I hope you are well. Who is ready for some more Cougar Town? Let's jump in.

Chick, Grayson and Jules talk to a heartbroken Travis.

In the kitchen, everyone discusses Andy's family passing through on their way to Miami. Ellie, Andy and Jules are still discussing it in the plaza with their coffee. Jules speaks Spanish.

Back in Jules', everyone discusses making Travis feel better. The possibility of taking Travis to a strip club comes up, Jules says no.

In Ellie's house, Andy's family show up. Andy's brother is disappointed he still hasn't learned Spanish. Andy's sister in law gives out lip kisses 😬

In Grayson's bar they discuss Grayson not wearing knee pads.

Laurie spots a child in Ellie's house and Ellie says ""The cousins are coming"".

Grayson is on his skates, being followed by a kid.

Chick gives Jules some singles, out the front of the club.

Turns out Laurie can speak Spanish too.

There's one person in the strip club who is supposed to get naked if they get any customers.

Grayson says bye to the kid.

Angela continues to flirt with Andy.

Travis pours his heart out at the club. Ultimately, he still puts on sunscreen. The stripper tells Travis her fiance was murdered.

Grayson lands in a bush.

Chick, Jules and Bobby dropped the stripper off.

Grayson sees the kid again. He's determined to skate home alone.

Ellie and Laurie talk in the pub, deep down Ellie really cares about Laurie? Her hat's not dumb at all? They're friends?

Chick gives some solid advice. 

Ellie brings everyone in her house Subway sandwiches.

Ellie tells her BIL what's been going on all day and Andy is tackled.

Travis goes to sleep on the couch in Jules' living room.

Nestor isn't around to see the inappropriate things Angela is teaching Andy.

So, what did everyone think? Are you a fan of this episode? Have you ever been called sausage toes? Can you speak Spanish? Any horror stories of in laws that you want to get off your chest? Let's talk about it.

1h5zdix,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/1h5zdix/pc_roblox_game_type_story_richmysterypuzzle/,"[PC] [ROBLOX GAME] [TYPE: STORY RICH/MYSTERY/PUZZLE] [PLAYED AT 2023] You move to a city to see your brother, but he is missing","I remember playing a game with a friend, where you moved to a city to see your brother, but every time you asked about him to someone, they always said they didn't see him in days or something. There were places like a bank, a library, a coffee shop, a suspicious alley, a cemetery, and a small market place.   
  
In the bank, you had to open a vault/cabinet by a code.   
  
In the library, there was a puzzle where you had to press buttons to make a fake bookshelf move, and there was a room behind it, where you had to open a vault with a certain color pattern, which you could find inside the place.

In the coffee shop, there wasn't much, just a strange (probably russian) woman wearing red who seemed to have passed through some stuff, and someone who saw our brother in a suspicious alley close to the coffee shop one time. (probably the owner of the coffee shop)

In the suspicious alley, as I remember, it was close to the coffee shop, and inside it, there was a suspicious man, and if you bought a thing from the suspicious man, you exploded or died. But the real thing is to find buttons around the city, and one of them is behind a trash can from the suspicious alley.

In the cemetery, you gotta find a very specific grave that has a button, and when you click it, a statue which is in the center of the place opens up, showing something I can't remember. 

And in the small market place, I just remember that it had the part of the bank's code or whatsoever, and a hidden button that would appear after a long while playing the game. 

The last things I remember is that in the end, you discover that your brother is a spy/an undercover agent who got very secret files that he wasn't supposed to have, so he was hid in this town, until he was found, and called us for help. You also gotta climb a tower by doing parkour, and most of the puzzles were very hard or confusing.

Tbh I applaud him for this because he’s vulnerable enough to explore it and just so happens that it’s with me. I talked to him about my life, sexually. I just kept on yapping to the point that I was introducing him to porn on Twitter and Grindr. He was turned on by guys on Twitter that he started massaging his dick under his pants. He did ask prior if it was okay for him to do it. I said yes. I was turned on too. Lol. But I did respect his boundaries and don’t want to make things awkward between us. 

He invited me again today for coffee. I introduced him to a new place and he just parked the car and asked questions about Grindr. I told him pros & cons and it’s essentially a hooking up app. He said it’s shitty lol. Overall it’s a nice wholesome experience with a curious straight guy. He even identifies as Vers Top eventho he didn’t have sex with a guy yet but he’s exploring.

[Sam Levin](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-levin) in Chino, California

Sun 29 Oct 2023 07.00 EDT

As California prosecutes a prison guard on nearly 100 charges, survivors behind bars say officer abuse is so widespread it feels inescapable: ‘All I know is how to survive’

Latasha Brown sat at a picnic table in the visiting area of the [California](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california) Institution for Women, just out of earshot of a guard standing watch. It was a hot morning in July and the 42-year-old spoke softly.

“There’s liberty in deciding not to live in fear anymore,” she said.

Brown was speaking out for the first time about the sexual abuse she has suffered at the hands of correctional officers over her 21 years in California prisons.

Once she started talking, she couldn’t stop: there was the officer who watched her shower, the official who demanded sexual favors in exchange for legal help, the officers who forced themselves on her and then gave her small “gifts”. Brown says she has been sexually assaulted by at least five correctional officers during her time behind bars, and harassed by many more: “We’re not only prisoners in here, we’re women, and we’re reminded of that through widespread male violence.”

In May, one of those guards, the former officer Gregory Rodriguez, was charged with nearly 100 counts of sexual violence. Authorities say Rodriguez is suspected of harassing, assaulting and raping at least 22 women in custody from 2014 to 2022, though court records and testimony from women and their lawyers suggest his abuse extends beyond the criminal allegations. Rodriguez has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

Five of the women who have come forward about Rodriguez say the abuse left them with lasting psychological distress that they’ve struggled to overcome in prison. They describe a system in which a lack of access to basic amenities like adequate food and hygiene products and regular family communication make them vulnerable to abuse by guards who promise privileges or threaten further restrictions. Abuse is so widespread it can feel inescapable and ordinary, women said, noting that they face immense pressure to stay silent, living with the stress of potentially lengthened sentences or solitary confinement if staff retaliate.

**‘He groomed me’**

Brown has been incarcerated for more than two decades, sentenced to 37 years to life for a murder she committed at age 15. She says was sexually abused as a child and again in county jail before she was sent to California’s women’s prisons. Brown has spent time at both CIW, an hour east of Los Angeles, and the Central California Women’s Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla, where Rodriguez worked.

Standing at the vending machines in the CIW visitors’ room, she selected a frozen pizza and a Starbucks coffee, luxuries she can’t get from the commissary: “It’s just these little things that make you feel more human,” she said.

Predatory guards take advantage of the lack of supplies and conveniences, making women dependent on them for items they either need to survive or simply to feel normal, Brown said: “As prisoners, our possessions are everything. What little we have is so important to us.”

Two officers who groped and assaulted her over the last decade would give her clothing to bribe her into silence, she continued, including bras and a bandana. One of the guards repeatedly fondled her at her prison job and then left her small presents in a trashcan not visible to cameras, she said. She remembers thinking of one of the guards as “generous”: “I’m deeply ashamed of it, but I also knew there was no recourse for us.”

Valerie\*, an incarcerated woman in her 30s who says she was repeatedly abused by Rodriguez in 2014, said he at first presented himself as one of the kind officers. When she arrived at CCWF, she felt alone and was often by herself, she said.

“When I think about how he groomed me, it wasn’t that he was forceful in the beginning. He was just a friendly face, always asking me how I was,” she recalled. “We appreciate the nice staff, because they’re the ones that treat us like humans. He positioned himself that way. I thought he cared … when really I was just being manipulated.”

Over time, Rodriguez started sexually assaulting her in unmonitored areas, she said, and pressured her to tell no one, warning that if anyone else knew, she’d face trouble. He suggested that would make it harder to get parole, she said: “‘You don’t want to be in that position because you want to go home.’”

She said she wanted the assaults to end, but was terrified of retaliation: “At that time, I felt I was responsible for all of the abuse … I just felt trapped because I couldn’t talk to anybody.”

**‘We can’t defend ourselves’**

The case against Rodriguez has sparked outrage in California, but data suggests the women’s experiences are incredibly common. The [last national survey](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri1112.pdf) of incarcerated people by the justice department, conducted in 2011 and 2012, counted roughly 47,000 people who had been sexually abused by staff in the previous 12 months, though the number is a significant undercount. The California department of corrections and rehabilitation (CDCR), which imprisons nearly 4,000 women, [logged](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/prea/wp-content/uploads/sites/186/2023/08/Annual-PREA-Report-Calender-Year-2022.pdf) more than 800 complaints of staff sexual abuse across the state last year.

“They say it’s one bad apple, but it’s not,” said Brown. “The abuse of prisoners is widespread but has largely gone unacknowledged.”

Brown said she was working as an aide for women with disabilities last year and was bringing a woman in a wheelchair into a parole hearing room when Rodriguez opened the door and rubbed his body on hers as she passed through – an assault he repeated on a second visit. She had not reported her previous assaults and didn’t want to disclose this one, either: “There is shame and stigma attached to being not just a victim, but a snitch. So I’ve learned how to fly under the radar and stay quiet. These people hold my life in their hands and I know the lengths they will go to cover up misconduct. I’ve watched officers turn a blind eye to the conduct of their peers or facilitate attacks on other inmates. All I know is how to survive.”

When abuse did become known, the consequences for women often were severe. Both Brown and Valerie say they were placed in solitary after staff found out about Rodriguez’s assaults on them. CDCR says women who report abuse are placed in “administrative segregation” for their safety and when no other housing options are available.

Selina\*, who reported that Rodriguez sexually assaulted her and who has testified for the prosecution, said she lived with daily fear that more people would find out she was a whistleblower and that she would face retaliation or violence as a result; she does not talk to her prison counselor about what she’s been through. When any officer makes a snide remark at her or looks at her in a certain way, she panics, she said.

“The only thing they could really do to keep me safe is to get me out of here,” she said. “We can’t defend ourselves in here, because who is going to listen to us? We’re a number in here. We’re not treated like people. I just want to get home to my kids.”

**‘I internalized my anger’**

The psychological toll of repeated sexual abuse in prison can be severe. Survivors of sexual assault described an intense struggle with shame, anxiety, fear, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress from living in an environment where abuse was normalized.

Compounding their challenges, many women who are incarcerated have already experienced trauma in their past. Studies in the US have [found](https://www.vera.org/newsroom/new-report-sheds-light-on-women-in-jail-the-fastest-growing-population-behind-bars) that 60% to 80% of incarcerated women experienced [sexual violence](https://vawnet.org/material/womens-experiences-abuse-risk-factor-incarceration-research-update) or domestic abuse before they were jailed, making them especially vulnerable to revictimization.

Several survivors described severe discomfort in confined spaces and feeling scared when anyone gets too physically close – triggers that are impossible to escape in prison. Brown said she felt trapped in a state of “permanent alert” and “perpetual uneasiness”; when anyone approaches her from behind, even a cellmate who is not threatening, it makes her body jump and her heart race. Recently a supervisor whispered something to her while trying to be quiet, and it caused her to panic.

Brown said that when she read old journal entries talking of the abuse, “I feel so sad for *her*. I minimize the abuse to distance myself.”

Rita\*, a 36-year-old woman who says Rodriguez assaulted her while she was incarcerated at CCWF, said that she had been sexually abused as a child and was so shaken and retraumatized by his attack that in the moment she almost physically fought back: “But instead I just shut down, because that was my coping mechanism when it happened to me as a child. And I felt like I was a child again.” She was recently released and has struggled at her first job post-prison, where she has to work in close quarters with male employees.

Survivors have few or no outlets to process their trauma, said Amika Mota, executive director of Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition, a non-profit group that works with incarcerated survivors, including victims in the Rodriguez case. “So many incarcerated people have never had access to any mental health support, so they hold so much within.”

Mota recently testified about her own experience of abuse inside California prisons and is part of a newly formed CDCR committee focused on preventing sexual violence. “The narrative we are fed – that if you speak up, you are no good, you are a ‘snitch’ – it becomes so internalized. Not speaking up becomes like a badge that we wear. The impact is that you begin to choke on your own voice when you start to use it.”

“I really internalized that anger towards myself,” said Valerie. “I really did feel like I brought this on myself, and I tried to deny that it happened … I felt dirty and did not know how to get rid of that filth.” She eventually became an educator, teaching her peers about sexual assault policies, which she said helped her speak out and learn to set boundaries.

**‘I will not bow down’**

CDCR declined multiple interview requests over several weeks. A spokesperson, Terri Hardy, said in an email that the department “investigates all allegations of sexual abuse, staff sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment pursuant to its zero-tolerance policy and as mandated by the federal [Prison Rape Elimination Act](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/prea/)”. The policy “also provides guidelines for the prevention, detection, response, investigation, and tracking of allegations against incarcerated people”, she said.

Rodriguez’s arrest, Hardy added, followed CDCR’s internal investigation and referral to prosecutors: “The department resolutely condemns any staff member – especially a peace officer who is entrusted to enforce the law – who violates their oath and shatters the trust of the public.”

Brown, one of the first to speak publicly about Rodriguez, said she knew there were risks in coming forward, but that it was empowering to no longer stay quiet: “I am guilty of the worst of human behavior. But just because I’m in prison does not mean my body and my labor are interchangeable properties.” She also agreed to testify before a recent hearing of lawmakers and CDCR leaders. Although officials declined to allow her to speak live, an advocate read her remarks, in which she recounted the moment she learned of Rodriguez’s arrest.

“I did not celebrate because sure, when we experience harm, we want some accountability. Some justice, even,” she said. “However, I don’t think his punishment should be the final resolution because it’s an amplified response to just one person’s abuse, not a response to the systemic abuse. And until our lives matter, I will not bow down.”

1h5yicp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1h5yicp/a_list_of_reasons_to_stop_smoking/,A list of reasons to stop smoking ,"Hello all,

I made some time ago a list of reasons to stop/escape smoking. I escaped smoking almost 2 years ago, I was a smoker of 2 packs a day, and life couldn't be better.  
I am about to say a very cliche thing, but... it really is all in your head. The physical withdrawal from nicotine itself is quite mild, and **most importantly,** the pleasure (all types of pleasure, including physical pleasure) a non smoker feels is greater than the pleasure a smoker feels. You actually *gain* when you quit smoking, you don't give up/quit/compromise/whatever. **You truly, 100%, gain. You literally lose nothing,** not even the morning/coffee cigarette. It pales in comparison to what a non smoker feels, and this comes from someone who couldn't imagine life without it. I know it sounds impossible to believe, it's very hard to not associate smoking with pleasure, but trust me, you'll see it too.  
Here's the list:

* You can finally breathe! A smoker definitely doesn't realise how much of their breathing is restricted by tobacco. Taking deep breaths can actually feel euphoric.
* You will save a LOT of money, and buying nice things for yourself will feel different when you know that you've saved money by quitting.
* You smell good. Like, perfumes actually persist on skin, and the scent isn't combined with the horrid smell of cigarettes (it is horrid, you realise that when you become a non smoker and smell a smoker, trust me). Having the confidence of smelling good definitely feels good.
* Your breath doesn't stink, you can talk very close to people's faces and not care about how your breath smells.
* You have more stamina overall, when you are a smoker there is a kind of lingering tiredness always following you around, but when you quit you feel completely rejuvenated after a good night's sleep, and actually feel like doing productive stuff.
* If you have a car, trust me, the feeling of a *clean* car which smells good is godly.
* You have more time. You actually waste a lot of time smoking, whether you realise it or not. This is very noticeable at first.
* Coffee without cigarettes is actually better! You can enjoy the true taste of a coffee without a horrid-smelling, burning stick distorting your taste! I actually got more into ""coffee culture"" after quitting, and I already was a coffee junkie before, whose biggest fear was not having a cigarette with his coffee.
* Food is AMAZING! You never know as a smoker how delicious good food really is. Oh, and after a good meal you don't feel the need to smoke (that sounds horrible now, can't imagine doing it)
* You slowly start ro realise how beautiful life is without cigarettes, how you forgot how life was before smoking, how bothersome smoking really was. It's a revelation. You start to see the ""little break"", the ""reward"", for what it is: a cesspool in which you nonchalantly bathe, for if you knew how bad it truly was, you would've ran as fast as possible.
* If you don't have a partner, your chances of having one will increase, since a lot of people won't date someone else because they are a smoker, rightly so.
* You can hit the gym/do intense cardio without worrying that you don't use your full potential.
* The people you hold dear in your life will respect you more, and you will be an encouragement for other people to stop smoking.
* You gain a very big amount of respect for yourself. It's a very notable achievement.
* You won't need to go outside to smoke ever again, you won't feel the shame and judgement that comes from being the only one in a group who goes outside to smoke.
* Not having to worry about how many cigarettes you have left is a relief, you don't feel a sense of doom everytime you don't have cigarettes, you don't turn into this robot who knows only one purpose when out of cigarettes, and that is to go buy some.
* Sex is definitely better, you don't tire out and since smoking causes vasoconstriction, your orgasms will be better, since there's more blood flow.

And, the most important reason, the number 1 reason: **You gain back everything that you've lost.** Escaping smoking shouldn't be an effort, it should be a relief and a joy. It should have the same sense of urgency as getting your hand off a hot stove. I know it can be hard to see things from this perspective, that is why I am recommending you to read Allen Carr's ""Easy way to stop smoking"". This is where the truth about smoking resides.

Looking back I think she might have loved me too. Should I reach out to her? What do I say? Do I tell her I was/am in love with her?**

Love and I were inseparable (until we weren't) in college. Things ended badly, and she never told me her reasons, just that “she was going through some things.” We ultimately left college that year without saying goodbye. I found out through instagram that she dropped out, and I never saw her again. I only realized I was in love with her when I felt the magnitude of my heartbreak.

Looking back, I think it’s possible we were in love with each other, but I don’t think she had any idea I was in love with her. Her excuse of “going through some things” never sat right with me because we told each other everything, but it *would* make sense if what she was going through was about me. I’m 50/50 on whether this theory is plausible or just wishful thinking. 

I can be oblivious to indications of romantic attraction and generally terrible at social cues, so here is some evidence for you to consider:

* The first time she came to my dorm, she dressed up. She was wearing a black lacy crop-top type thing and short shorts. At the time I was like 'why would she wear that it looks uncomfortable,' but in retrospect she might have dressed up because she liked me? 
* The next week, we went to a party with the basketball team. there was a moment in the uber that I swear we almost kissed (but then she started dating another girl so I assumed that was that). 
* When she was dating that girl, she spent more time with me than with her gf. 
* She’d come sleep in my bed when she needed a safe place to hide. 
* We’d often lay in a hammock with her between my legs, her back pressed against my ribs, my hands in her hair. We used to be so tangled up in each other. 
* Whenever she saw me, she would run at full speed and jump at me, and I always caught her (even if i had to drop my coffee). 
* When we had nothing else to do, we’d lay in my twin bed and talk, her head resting against my chest, practically laying on top of me. 
* She posted me on her instagram as woman crush wednesday. 
* She would text me while actively having sex with someone. 
* Once, while we were pressed together, she told me a friend asked her if we were more than friends. I responded along the lines of “they're dumb.” In retrospect, I realize she might have been testing the waters with me. 

My friends and family don't get it because they think she treated me badly and it's ancient history at this point. But I still think about her everyday. I go around and around in my head about what was and what could have been if things were different. I’ve written an album of sad ass songs about it (embarrassing!). 

I’m not so naive to imagine we’ll actually be back in each other’s lives, I don’t even know if she’s in the country. It's been 8 years; we're both totally different people now. Logically, I don’t know her at all and she doesn’t know me anymore, but logic does nothing to heal the her-shaped hole in my heart.

Part of me just wants closure. I still want to know what she was going through, I still want to understand why she left. I want her to know there's no hard feelings about her disappearing. I want to say sorry for all the things I screwed up (there was a lot). 

The bigger part of me just wants tell her how incredible she is. Even though things ended badly between us, I’ll never stop wanting the best for her or rooting for her. I guess I want her to know what she means to me if only so she knows how magical she is and that there's at least one person from that time in her life that loves her deeply. 

So should I reach out? Do I tell her I was/am in love with her? What should I say? (suggested messages/language welcomed).

1h5ygww,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1h5ygww/16_days_in_looking_for_advice/,16 days in looking for advice. ,"Hi all.   16 DAYS into carnivore (f51, 72.5 kilo, 5f 6 ) I started because i have joint pain, too much excess weight and brain fog.

I’m looking for some advice, and I know this community is super supportive so I’m being brave and asking for help.  First time posting. 

Already on carnivore I’ve got crazy good energy and my brain fog is much improved… I fell sharp and clear and just all around better and present in my every moment.  My mood is much more stable as well and I’ve lost 2 kilo, my starting weight was 74.5.

I started a weights routine trying for a 2-3 times a week, about 40 min each, I’m on my feet all day and clock from 9k -16k steps. 

I switched directly from OMAD CICO 1300 to Carnivore but because of my previous WOE my body doesn’t understand it’s “hunger” or “full” cues.  So I’m worried I’m over eating because my calorie Intake is twice what it use to be.  

Currently I’m eating 3 meals a day, could be…. 5 eggs scrambled with lots of butter, rib eye with lots of butter, 70/30 mince with lots of butter, salmon, prawns all with lots of butter, homemade simple liver pate(nothing but liver and butter), bacon…. Everything with extra butter and/or cooked in ghee.  My butter is salter so I don’t add extra salt. I’ve stopped drinking coffee.  Also, fun topic, my stools are every day or every other day but they are pretty healthy, not hard, not runny. 

I’ve watched and listened to lots conflicting info about, to or not to, count calories or fast on this WOE, and I’m CONFUSED… if I only eat 1 meal a day, will my body think I’m staving it and start stockpiling the fat I’m eating, OR will it start utilising the fat I have stored and I’ll loose significant weight. 

Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks crew 🥩",1,1733260712.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False

1h5yfu3,https://i.redd.it/jjr3w27r9p4e1.jpeg,"What Is This Creature, and Why Do I Keep Seeing It?","I want to start this off by saying I'm a believer of the paranormal, native folklore, and aliens. After all, we only know what we're told. I have a weird sense when seeing or reading stories regarding these things. I can tell whether it's real or not by how my body reacts. I get tense, hyper focused, and my eyes begin to water. Not like I'm crying or anything. It's involuntary and, depending on the severity, uncontrollable. 
          I live in upstate NY, outside of Rochester. I've lived in this area my whole life. I'm 24 now, but the first time I saw this.... thing... I was about 10 years old. 
          The house I lived in at the time backed up to a rich neighborhood, though my house was anything but. It was small, too small for my family at the time since my mom just had her third child, but my younger brother and I made it work by spending time outside. We had met a kid whose grandparents lived in the house directly behind mine. The three of us would hang out all of the time. His backyard boardered dense woods, with a creek that ran along the yards of the neighborhood. 
          These woods were great to play in. The three of us would spend hours there. From dawn until dusk. We'd play hide and seek, ghost in the graveyard, and even make our own treasure hunts. We never strayed too far from the house, though. I was the oldest of the group, and I always wanted to protect the other two. My brother, only 5 at the time, would always try to sneak off down the creek, but I caught him every time. He begged and begged me to go with him and explore more. It made me feel very uneasy. 
          One day, mid summer, the three of us joined together and went into the woods like any other day. Only this time, the creek was dried up. This wasn't out of the ordinary. It would happen every so often when it didn't rain for a while. This time, we made our way down to the muddy ground where the creek used to be, and we saw canine footprints. We thought it could've been my nighbors dog, since they'd let her free roam through the woods, but there were multiple sets. In the end we determined it was coyotes. The tracks lead down the creek, away from our houses. 
          My curiosity tossed my sense of waryness away. I looked at my brother and asked if he wanted to follow the tracks. His eyes lit up and he started running off. Our friend and I quicky caught up to him and told him to be quiet. I wanted to follow the tracks and find whatever made them. 
          We walked for a while following the tracks. They never strayed away from the muddy indent that the creek left. Suddenly, something came over me. I froze and felt my brother run into me. I put my arm out in front of him and held my finger up to my mouth, telling the other two to be quiet. I felt it. My heartbeat began to race, my body became tense, and I felt my eyes start watering. I was frantically looking around, trying my best to see anything that could be lurking. 
          Our friend asked what was wrong and I let out an aggravated ""shush!"" Then I heard leaves rustling not far from where we were standing. I turned my attention to the area where the sound came from. I squinted, trying to make my eyes adjust through the tears. I froze when I noticed a pale, looming shape standing in the creek ditch several yards away. I couldn't see much through the thick growth of the woods, but I could tell the creature was humanoid. I had never seen someone so tall. Panic set it when I noticed the creature didn't have any distinct facial features. Only dark, sunken in areas where the eyes should have been. 
          I grabbed my brother's arm and screamed, ""PERSON!!"" Before running off with my brother and our friend close behind. We ran faster than we ever had before. Trudging through the mud and jumping over fallen branches or stones. Eventually we reached our friends yard. We ran through the grass and collapsed onto his back porch. We were panting and weak from the run. No one was home at the time. We went in and cleaned ourselves up. I remember my brother asking me what I saw. I told him it was a man, but deep down, I know that thing was not human. 
          The following days were fuzzy. I could only see the eerie image of whatever creature I saw whenever I closed my eyes. I was terrified to go outside near the woods. We would bring our friend over to our house instead. 
          I will mention, we were renting this house. Our landlords practiced dark witchcraft. I didn't know this at the time. So many weird things happened at this house. We would hear a baby crying from a different, when my baby brother was sound asleep. We saw dirty handprints on the ceiling as if someone was being dragged away. Fairy statues would constantly appear out of nowhere in our yard. One of our dogs would go into our parents closet upstairs and bark for hours. We'd see people walking around our yard. We didn't stay in this house much longer. 
        A year or so later, we moved to a different neighborhood. Our new house backed up to a creek with another neighborhood on the other side. A little ways down, there were more woods. Though this time, we stayed far away. 
          I grew intrigued with the supernatural. I researched many different things. Skin walkers, Slenderman, the angelic trumpets, hauntings, witches, and so much more. I was infatuated with all things paranormal. I began to think that what I saw that day in the woods was Slenderman. Tall with no facial features. Though I don't remember seeing his iconic black suit and red tie. 
          One day, remember walking into my parents bedroom one day to grab something. Their TV was on the SiFi channel. What I saw made my heart drop. It was a man explaining a photo that was taken by a hiker. It's a famous photo that I'm sure everyone has seen by now. It was a picture of a creature called ""The Rake."" I felt the sensation that I knew all too well. I tensed, my heart began to pound, and my eyes started to stream. 
          I ran over to my mom in the other room and told her to come and see what was on the TV. She followed and sat to listen to the program for a minute or two. Eventually she said, ""this is the SiFi channel. You don't need to worry about any of this."" But, even with those words, I couldn't let go of the feeling. Had this been what I saw?
          Fast-forward almost 10 years. I now had three younger brothers and we were living in a different house again. I was partially living with my parents, but I spend most of my days and nights at my boyfriend's house. 
          I was an opener at a Tim Hortons. For any non-upstate New Yorker or anyone not from Canada, it's a coffee and bakery shop created by a former NHL Sabres player. I would wake up at around 3:30am to get ready and head to work. I've had sleeping problems my entire life, so you could only imagine how groggy I was each morning. 
          One morning, I woke up at my parents house and began getting ready for work. I got in my car and drove off. I was driving down a long road that lead almost directly to my job. It was dark and this road didn't have streetlights. Rarely any of the streets in my town do. I drove a Jeep at the time. My seat was pretty high from the ground. 
          As I was driving down this dark road, something alerted me to focus. I felt my heart began to beat fast. Suddenly, about 10 yards in front of my car, a huge creature darted out in front of me. It crossed from the right side to the left. My headlights lit up the pale creature and I saw what it looked like for a split second. It's skin was tight and almost pure white. The creature was skinny with long limbs, it's back legs being much longer. I could not catch any facial features, if there were any. I slammed on my breaks, my car screeching as it came to a stop. On the other side of the road, was a wide field. There were no trees, bushes, or fences around. The creature should have been there, but when I tried to look, I saw nothing but short grass. 
          I pulled over to the side of the road after driving up a bit to catch my breath. I kept telling myself, ""it was just a deer."" But deep down I know that wasn't the case. I drove cautiously to work. My eyes darting from one side of the road to the other, paranoid that something else would jump out at me. 
          Barely getting to work on time, I went in though the back and sat by one of our break tables for a second to collect my thoughts. My eyes were streaming, but I wasn't crying. I was insanely tense and I had trouble catching my breath. Eventually, I decided to suck it up and stark work. Walking to the kitchen area, I greeted our baker who had gotten there half an hour before. I didn't sit and chat. Instead I just went right to work, trying to get the image of the ""deer"" out of my mind. I got my eyes to stop watering. 
          Our baker called me back into the kitchen area and when I turned the corner, she asked me what was wrong. She could obviously tell something was disturbing me. I told her ""no, it's nothing. I just saw something weird on my way here."" She asked me where and I told her. The face of terror on her face made my blood run cold. 
          There was an apartment complex further up the road I was on. She told me she lived in those apartments. Across the street from there was a park. Nothing crazy. It's a wooded area just barely more than 100 acres. She told me she has seen a creature in those woods at night and that one time, she had caught it out in her back yard. Her husband had seen it too. I asked her what it looked like and she described the exact same thing that had been haunting me since I was 10. 
          ""It's huge. It can run fast on all fours, but it walks upright, too. It's skin is so white it's almost transparent. It's back legs are twice the length of its front legs. It's face is pretty much flat with dark holes for eyes.""
          I felt panic rise again. My eyes were streaming again and I clenched my fists. I hadn't told her anything about what I saw besides where it was and that it was ""weird."" When I told her that what she described was exactly what I saw, tears began to well up in her eyes as well. We talked about it for a while. I told the story of when I was 10 and she told me other paranormal stories of her own childhood. 
          It's been 3 years since then. I'm now fully living with by boyfriend and I no longer work at restaurants. Life is great. Though the image of the creature I have seen keeps popping into my mind. Seeing it in the woods as a kid. Seeing it run across the road right in front of my car. It's terrifying. I still feel sick whenever I drive near either of those areas. I'm terrified it will show up again. 
          What is this creature? Why have I seen it more than once? ",0,1733260636.0,Unexplained,7,0.4,False
1h5yftz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/1h5yftz/pgr_inspired_archmage_idea/,PGR inspired archmage idea,"(Assume the flexibility of the game's lore and ability to custom make your setting a bit here. Also sorry for the wall of text i got carried away.)
PGR (Punishing: Gray Raven) gave me a weird idea that i want to share here because why not.
Anyway the idea is inspired by the character that i will not name but they are the Observer assigned to this world and they have straight up godlike powers that they used only when the humanity didn't have any good outcome timelines left (without their help that is) but they did interfere here and there to give certain characters second chances to finish what they were yet to finish.
We don't know what happens to truly ascended mages so what if they go beyond our reality with their whole being and ONLY the Observers that chose to mingle with the ""lower dimensions"" project themselves into this reality to observe guide and if the reality (or at least the world) itself is in danger interfere with their godlike powers. This can be an explanation of why the world didn't go through dozens of apocalypses at this point even though it was on the verge multiple times. A perfect STPC. The one that orchestrated the entire chronicle and its participants lives just the way the world needs to survive and if it fails they will try again in the different timeline or interfere showing what they can truly do. When asked why don't they just interfere and save the world themselves they will reply something akin to ""Will you get the experience and lessons you need then? Will the world improve itself then? It's like asking a parent to do everything for their child and spoil them rotten. Now why would a responsible parent do that?"". These types of archmages may not even take paradox since the projection is not even them and kinda not even human and the true them are beyond this reality but they are ALWAYS responsible and careful enough to not interfere too much so they don't need a limiter. Make them be beyond time being able to move through it like space, see all timelines at the same time, always be there when they are needed but NEVER do anything extra beyond what they need (except stuff like ""here have some coffee (casually creates a coffee cup)"" of course). For another example see angels from Dragonball Super (they are not that omnipotent but still). Make them take some inconspicuous role and pose as just a weirdly wise and calm guy that ""just so happens"" to work with the group if you need to.
Spoilers for those who play PGR (open if you don't care and just want to know the character):>!It's Ishmael or The Merciful One. The character we see in the game is merely a projection yet it is literally top 1 character in terms of power (at least for now). She also poses in an inconspicuous role just in front of our noses the entire game in Babylonia (the colony ship that most of humanity evacuated into) and as that mysterious cloaked Merciful One that just saves some characters that have unfinished business on the surface of the Earth. She also has the themes of biblically accurate angels. Also HER ULT IS LITERALLY TAKING THE ENTIRE REALITY INTO A BALL AND BITING IT!

I (18M) recently came back home to spend Christmas break with my mom and stepdad in Houston (I go to school in California, but any break/vacation I immediately come back home). Over thanksgiving a friend of mine  recently moved out and had invited me to his new apartment for a ""Friendsgiving"" get together. There I met this really attractive guy (30m) and we hit it off immediately. My friends apartment is located in the Montrose area of Houston which has always been known to be more artsy and progressive area of Houston. Well after the party started to die down I got bored and downloaded, well, you know what (Grindr).

Eventually I got a tap from this profile and when I clicked on the profile I was floored. Literally it was like the man of my dreams stepped out of my thoughts and into my phones screen. Muscular, beautiful smile, deepest blue eyes, super intelligent. After trading pics and chatting for a bit we decided to go on a little brunch date that following Saturday.

Saturday rolls around, he offers to pick me up. When I get in the car, he gave me a rose and I practically melted. He took me to my favorite brunch place, even payed for both of our meals (I offered to Zelle him, he wasn't having it). Afterwards he takes me to a little lake around my mom's house and we cuddled on a bench, in the middle of nature with a blanket just looking at the lake and smoking. We talked about our lives, how it was for me coming out ( I come from a latino family, so it took a while for my family to accept it), how he struggled coming out too because he came from a conservative and religious family. we talked about politics and sensitive issues and realized we hold a lot of the same views. After all that I tell him it's getting late and I need to home.

Here is where I think it went wrong;

Around the time we hanging out, I got a text from my mom saying that she and my step dad were going to my step sisters house to be with my step dads grandkids, so the house was going to be completely empty. We get to my mom's and because no one is home I invited him in, and, well, we had sex.

Honestly y'all, & I know, tmi but it was some of the best dick I ever had. I am by no means a virgin or a prude, in college I had a few hook ups and casually dated a few guys but this was next level. He was kissing me, being gentle when I asked him, being rough when I wanted it, putting me in every position I asked , at one point I was so turned on I told him he could do whatever he wanted to me. Towards the end he was laying down on the couch and I was riding him and when I looked at him to make eye contact, he just started kissing me so passionately, like he loved me (honestly, just remembering it has me crashing out). He even had my legs shaking so bad I could barely move after we both came. We sat there on the couch just cuddling under a blanket for a bit then he said he should go because he had to work in the morning.

Fast forward to that morning, I texted him wishing him a good morning--did not receive a text back. A few hours later I double texted him again saying I hope he was having a great day.  Later that day I texted him if I could maybe do something nice like take him some coffee or something sweet and that's when I noticed our messages turned green (we both have iPhones). I tried to audio call on FaceTime and that's when it was confirmed, blocked.

I spoke to my friend about it and he said it was probably because ""I gave it up too easy"". At first I thought that perhaps that could have been it because I did mention how I wanted to wait until maybe a 3rd or 4th date to do anything physical. However, I guess I kind of got too carried away with how ""in to me"" he presented himself,  plus he seemed like such a gentlemen I literally thought screw waiting till the 3rd or 4th date I want it right this second. Now that im blocked with basically no explanation, I feel kind of like this dumb kid who read the signs wrong and basically got used.

Did I read the signs wrong? I figured if he just wanted a quick nut, why do all the extra work like take me on a date, pay for me and gift me a flower?",5,1733260630.0,askgaybros,5,0.86,False

What's with Elleri's remark about there being no escape from the island? Why did he confronted the culprit instead of taking advantage of the pretences?

We thought it would be a good idea to invite my wife's parents to come stay with us for a few months so they can spend some quality time with their grandchild since we live in a different country. Or so thought.

The past few weeks has been a horror show for me personally. My Inlaw's have made themselves at home, so much so that they blatantly disregard the fact that it is our home and things are kept a certain way or that things work different in another country. For example, the cooking range is on 90% of the day, they are always cooking or making tea or coffee or something else. I hear the beeps from it the entire day and it drives me nuts. When they cook, they make a mess of the kitchen and hate the sight of it. I have to spend a lot of time every evening to clean up and reset the kitchen. Oh and they go through like 10 Liters of milk a week! They always need a hot cup of coffee or milk tea in their hands. 

We are trying to create sustainable habits with our new born, but my in-laws want to constantly carry him and keep baby talking into his face loudly. We fear this stimulates the baby way too much and it takes much time for him to calm down and nap in the evening. They don't care for our rules or how we want the baby to grow once they leave. Ar this point they've taken up so much of the house, do the chores the way they please and it almost always warrants extra effort from us to do it right or clean up after, cook what they like, and hog time with baby that I no longer feel comfortable leaving my bedroom or my home office without getting annoyed at something that they did or are doing. It has been a month and they are here for 2 more!

1h5y5kq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h5y5kq,Ear ye! ear ye,"This is my first post and my third ever batard! Thanks for all the inspiration guys!

Recipe is 80% hydration and based off the classic open crumb recipe of @fullproofbaking 
- https://youtu.be/HlJEjW-QSnQ?si=M3Z0e2PYVB9OdtHZ
- 287g KA bread flour
- 70g Bobs Red Mill whole wheat flour
- 280g water
- 72g levain (90% hydration fed with 90% KA bread flour and 10% BRM Rye).

One of my first batards! On the crust, the ear and blisters look great 🤩. Blistering specifically improved after decreasing flour during my shaping, following advice from @jimchall. I thoroughly spritz the dough surface before baking

Inside the crumb, nice to see organized and open alveoli but I know we can do even better!

On the sticky note I include my full recipe (287g KA bread flour, 70g Bobs Red Mill Whole, 280g water, 72g levain) with the baking schedule, which has the time, volume rise, temperature, and pH of the entire process. I came across the idea of using pH from @the_bread_code and it’s really helped me understand fermentation beyond just looking at the usual volume, smell, and texture indicators

I made two doughs A and B, which were mixed/bulked/proofed separately, the only difference is one was shaped into a batard and the other a boule. By comparing measurements from two “identical” mixes, I can estimate the error of each kind of measurement. As expected, the temperature is nearly the same between the two doughs, with little variance between the two doughs. The aliquot jar volume measurement is quite noisy (putting into fridge at 240% rise in A, 200% rise in B) but the pH seems to be a more consistent measurement (4.35 vs 4.40 pH). But maybe this is more a statement of my bad hand mixing 😆

Separate but really cool that I also get 4.4pH at end of bulk at around 100% rise as @fullproofbaking also sees (aliquot sample extracted before any folding).

Honestly the open crumb is all that matters to me. I am happy with this I would rate 8/10 but still would like to achieve truly open crumb on a godly level as demonstrated by Kristen @fullproofbaking and replicated by some of her best disciples like Bread by Joy Ride Coffee (see YouTube). 

Any tips for open crumb? Generally agree with Trevor Wilson that dough handling is key, and obviously fermentation, so looking for detailed advice. Please share your crumb pics!",16,1733259924.0,Sourdough,5,1.0,False

I also love A24 movies; exploring mountains and forests but not in a serious hiker way, more like an unleashed toddler who wants to hunt for cool bugs; that's what she said jokes; playing Scrabble; drinking a lot of coffee; going to museums and bookstores and coffee shops and hole-in-the-wall restaurants.  
  
My ideal relationship consists of lots of banter, flirting, emotional intimacy, loyalty, support, and a foundation of friendship. I want to text all day about what you're eating and what you're thinking and what the sky looks like from your window. I want to roast you about your weird habits and you like it because you know I adore you. I'm fine with a long distance relationship, but I would want us to visit each other.

Good afternoon!! It’s 3:00 pm, F 25 interested in swinging back into my writing life. The big bad depression bug bit, but now I’m back. I’m frequently described as quirky, sensitive, kind, thoughtful, playful, and a bit of a hippie.  Writing recently has been kind of hard, but I’m slowly finding my motivation again! I’m craving an AMAZING story to get the juices flowing again.

I’m most interested in finding someone that I can chat with ‘out of character’ just as easily as I can send a roleplay reply to. One of the more important deciding factors of my partners for me is how I click with them on a personal level.  Writing back and forth to an anonymous internet person is fun I suppose, but what gets me excited is a friend on the other side of the messages who is enjoying every moment just as much as I am. 

Please be 23+, within 6 hours of CST, at least decent grammar and spelling capabilities (I get everybody makes mistakes), romance is pretty important to me within the roles.  slow burn is preferred! 

Universes I am interested in exploring: 
- Bridgerton/Queen Charlotte (would also enjoy adding more fantasy elements) 
- The Vampire Diaries/The Originals
— ACOTAR

Pairings/Settings I am interested in exploring: 
- Royal court drama (pick and choose any member)
- Military personnel/civilian in a sci fi setting
- Dnd type adventure (not in the DM way, just setting) 
- Monsters and humans oh my! 
- open to hearing your ideas if you’re looking for a pal and writing partner in one!!

Her long blonde curls bounced softly as she walked towards the counter, her hips visibly swaying even beneath her heavy winter coat.  The clatter of dishes being thrown into the sink, the bathroom door swinging open and shut, and the quiet hum of the heater running snapped him back to reality from his day dreams.

There is a language barrier between 2 companies. The acquiring company is well established in Europe, they want to expand in the UK. Basically, take competitor of the market scenario. Since then, there’s been a lot of changes. It’s a furniture store with over 100 stores or so. The head office and digital team is small employee size wise.

1. All of C suite and board were to go first. The acquiring company doesn’t specialise in flooring, so they were to go second. All of them got made redundant.
2. All the directors resigned together in one email. So one person emailed and cc’d everyone together and combined resigned. They were meant to serve 3 months notice, but did 1.
3. Manager resigned along with Head of. They didn’t replace them, but are replacing low level positions e.g. marketing executives.
4. 1 by 1 people from HR are leaving, 3 people left in one week.
5. They stopped free tea and coffee to store staff, only customers get free tea and coffee. They reduced bonuses and talking about taking company care of the managers.
6. Multiple store staff have resigned and gone to competitors.
7. All the marketing comes from the acquiring company.
8. All the budget has been stopped.
9. Apparently a colleague has been offered £700 to stay until March.

I’m scared I will be made redundant, I tried explaining my fears to my manager but he told me I should wait for official news from management like director level. I shouldn’t listen to rumours. I said the acquiring company doesn’t want UK offices and there’s duplication of teams. He acted like I’m delusional to think this way. He also said no one has been told to go. People are choosing to leave. But, the people who have left aren’t being replaced e.g. HR and commercial teams. I tried explaining how I feel but I got told I’m being negative and blunt. I need to be more positive.

1h5y2zf,https://v.redd.it/6qrlqvq27p4e1,"Please help me solve this espresso riddle... [Breville Double Boiler, Sette 270 Grinder]","Hi Community, 
Long time reader first time poster, but I desperately need help. I convinced my partner to get a ""proper"" machine and grinder after we had our De'Longhi Dedica combo for 7 years and now she's upset that we can't have good coffee anymore.

We got a new machine (the Breville Double Boiler), a new grinder (Settle 270), got a few accessories (distributer, and scale), and I got the parameters kinda right I think. 

I added the extra disc in the settle grinder and now it will grind fine for espresso. 
I got fresh beans, roasted 2- 3 weeks prior and have tried 3 different brands. (It's not the beans, it's user error somewhere)
I measure 19g of dose (Breville has this razor tool to work out how much gap there should be, so I adjusted it to that), I have adjusted it so I'm on grind setting  5H (in case someone has this grinder), my machine is at 89⁰ (I set it lower than 93⁰ according to darker roasts), I get around 9bar pressure, 30s flow, in this shot in the video about 37g espresso. I think the flow rate looks fine, maybe a bit fast, but the Crema looks okay, and I'd expect some drinkable shot, but I literally have to spit the coffee out.

Trouble shooting: 
My puck is usually a bit wet when it comes out of the machine, but not soupy. Once I knock it, I it stays together and I don't think I see any channeling. It's brittle and fairly dry.
I've tried using different ratios. I tried 18g and 20g, when I tried dosing more it blocks the machine. I used 19g and extracted 27g, and I did 19g and extracted 56g and they both taste equally bad.

I can't tell if it's too bitter or sour (the beginner guide I used, liked below, suggested to dial one way of it's too sour and another if it's too bitter, but it's just horrible all around)

Please tell me what I'm doing wrong. 

Even if I don't get the shot 100% dialled in to have the GOD shot, it should still be drinkable, but mine just isn't. I feel like I'm missing something essential here. I feel like I've tried to play with everything and can't get a half decent shot out.

On my old machine I used a pressurized basket (double wall portafilter basket) and the results were good. Recently, after many failed attempts, I switched to a pressurized basket on the new machine, just to enjoy a half decent shot, and it's still horrible.

I'm following (at least trying to) this guide and I read through many others... https://espressoaf.com/guides/beginner.html

Any feedback would be so appreciated!

1h5y2u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slycooper/comments/1h5y2u3/penelope_in_sly_4/,Penelope in Sly 4,"Considering how if you watch how Penelope is as the Black Baron, during the welcome speech, Penelope apparently let a lot of hazings occur on her watch during previous ACES meetings. This included teams that severed the landing gear off of the other team’s planes, or putting rat poison in another team’s coffee. Note that Penelope, who was at the time the leader of the event, never banned anyone from coming for these infractions; she let them stay.

Cut to the battle on the wing in the end of the chapter: she could have nearly killed Sly to keep her secret, even though she had done everything she could to help them up until this point. Penelope could easily surrender as the Black Baron, but she was committed to the bit. It’s only when Sly breaks her mask that she concedes.

Then she is drafted into the Cooper Vault job. She’s a great RC expert, a master with computers on par with Bentley, and she’s a good person to be around. But suddenly she’s a bit of a damsel in distress; she gets captured regularly, she gets blinded in that one mission in Blood Bath Bay. It’s only when she has to duel against LeFwee that that competency she had as the Black Baron shines through again. But what is important here is what she *is trying to be*: an RC expert. A mask.

Cut to Sly 4. She is the Black Knight, drafted into service by Le Paradox in order to assist him in wiping out Sly’s ancestry. Penelope is convinced that Sly is the only thing standing in between Le Paradox and Bentley’s full potential, to the point that she is willing to go out of her way to try and kill Sly to do so. Yet another mask.

Penelope is a character defined by their mask; they are what people need them to be in that exact moment, to the point of it being a flaw, limiting her own potential for the sake of developing others. I like the idea of Penelope using her time as the Black Knight in Sly 4 as a vent for her own insecurity, as poorly communicated as it appears. 

Something important I wanna offer as a bonus: we don’t really know Penelope’s *actual* backstory, how she grew up, and what her influences are. Compared to other characters like Panda King or Dimitri, she’s the character that is only defined by what she can provide to the team. She probably sees Bentley as suffering a similar fate, and thus empathizes with a struggle that exists primarily just for herself.

You could argue that Guru is sort of the same, but he is more of a ‘mysterious mystical teacher’ sort of role, and has only appeared once to provide support. His depth and backstory is self-explanatory. But Penelope is interesting, because I always saw Bentley as being a sort of deuteragonist in Sly. Bentley could break both of his buds out of jail off of smarts alone. Bentley can throw down with some pretty bad dudes in general. Bentley has access to abilities that *let him freeze time.*

I just think Penelope is interesting because we don’t really know *her*, just what she brings to the table and what she means for other people. Which is very interesting, in the sense that she seems to criticize Bentley for exactly her own purpose within Sly’s greater narrative. She is defined by what her potential means for other people, she is always defined by her mask.",2,1733259736.0,Slycooper,2,1.0,False

Cannabis edibles have revolutionized how people enjoy marijuana, offering a discreet and smoke-free alternative to traditional consumption. From ancient cannabis-infused drinks to modern gummies and chocolates, edibles provide a unique, flavorful, and long-lasting experience. Whether you’re a medical marijuana patient or a recreational user, this guide will walk you through the history, benefits, and safe use of cannabis edibles.

# 🌟 A Brief History of Cannabis Edibles

Edibles have been a part of human culture for centuries:

* **2000 BCE**: Ancient Indian texts reference *bhang*, a cannabis-infused drink used in religious rituals.
* **1000 CE**: North African Berber tribes created *Majoun*, a cannabis jam with nuts and honey.
* **19th Century**: Edibles gained popularity in Europe and the U.S., with hashish candies and other medicinal products.
* **Modern Era**: California’s legalization of medical marijuana in 1996 sparked the rise of today’s billion-dollar edible market.

# 🍫 What Are Cannabis Edibles?

Edibles are food and drink products infused with cannabinoids like THC and CBD. Common examples include:

* **Baked Goods**: Brownies, cookies, and muffins.
* **Confections**: Gummies, chocolates, and candies.
* **Beverages**: Coffee, tea, and infused sodas.
* **Cooking Staples**: Cannabutter and infused oils.

Edibles are ideal for users seeking a long-lasting and smoke-free experience.

# 🧪 How Do Edibles Work?

* **Decarboxylation**: Cannabis must be heated to activate THC for edibles.
* **Metabolism**: Edibles are absorbed through the digestive system, where THC is converted into **11-hydroxy-THC**, a more potent and long-lasting compound.
* **Effects**: This process results in stronger effects that can last 6–8 hours.

# ⏱ Timing and Dosage

Edibles have a delayed onset and require careful dosing:

* **Onset**: Effects may take **30–60 minutes** (or up to 2 hours for some).
* **Duration**: Effects last longer, peaking around 3 hours and tapering off over 6–8 hours.
* **Dosage Guidelines**:
   * **Beginner**: Start with 1–5 mg THC and wait 24 hours before increasing.
   * **Intermediate**: 5–15 mg per dose.
   * **Experienced**: 20 mg or more.

Patience is key—overconsumption can lead to an overwhelming high.

# 💚 Benefits of Cannabis Edibles

1. **Long-Lasting Relief**: Perfect for managing chronic pain, anxiety, or insomnia.
2. **Smoke-Free Option**: Ideal for those with respiratory concerns.
3. **Discreet Use**: Odorless and easy to carry.
4. **Variety**: A wide range of flavors and forms to suit every preference.

# ⚠️ Risks of Edibles

1. **Delayed Onset**: Can lead to impatience and overconsumption.
2. **Potency**: Metabolized THC is stronger than smoked or vaped THC.
3. **Accidental Ingestion**: Appealing flavors make edibles risky for children and pets.
4. **Low Bioavailability**: Only **4–12%** of cannabinoids are absorbed due to digestion.

# 💡 Tips for Safe Consumption

* **Start Low, Go Slow**: Begin with a small dose and wait for the full effects before consuming more.
* **Read Labels**: Choose products with clear dosage information and third-party lab testing.
* **Choose the Right Setting**: Consume in a comfortable, familiar environment.
* **Store Securely**: Keep edibles out of reach of children and pets.
* **Stay Calm**: If you overconsume, relax, hydrate, and wait it out.

I know he appreciates how I help his kids feel happy. But I sometimes feel like he just wanted a partner in life now to be more of a roommate or to be helpful with his kids (who live on their own now).

For me when I love someone, I love to light them up, in small or big ways. I've also been used to that from my past dating life, men would love to do things to make me smile and vice versa.

Small examples, we had a few hours to spare in between some errands and were sitting in a coffee shop when I realize there's a small town carnival next door. I excitedly say, oh let's go! You can win me a stuffy like in the romantic movies. He kinda sighed and dismissed me. We didn't end up going. I asked for flowers occasionally, that also seemed to be annoying but he does bring them sometimes now. I started sending him loving texts of appreciation which were often ignored and def not reciprocated. He will snuggle in bed sometimes and likes to watch TV together. We can laugh and enjoy each other's company, but for the most part it feels like a roommate and not a significant other.
I get this happens in long term relationships or when people are in busy raising kids phases etc. But this feels odd for me. I've expressed it many times with not much response from him. He is def not cheating so that's not a factor but it just doesn't feel fulfilling.

But the idea of freedom is daunting. I'm 18. I'm legally an adult. My mom says I can do whatever I want, and she'll be okay with it as long as I'm safe. She knows I play by the rules.

There's this girl I dated online in the past. She and I are friends, and its been years since we've actually seen eachother. I know what she looks like, she knows what I look like. We've made plans for this coming Monday where I'll take the train up to go and see her. I've never been on a train before. I've never booked a ticket. I've never been alone and so far away either (we live an hour away from eachother). I've hung out with people alone, and I've wandered the town I live in alone. But I haven't actually stepped foot in this city alone before. Everyone I knew in the past was nearby. I used to live in that city for years. Now, it's been four years since I've stepped foot in the area and I wouldn't know where to go.

I should go. It could be fun. We're going to get coffee, she's going to show me her guitars. We might skateboard if it's not too cold. It will only be for about four hours too. I'm just so nervous, and I don't know if its in a good way either.

Perhaps it's both, I don't know. I want to see her. Or I think I do. I want to explore. I want to experience some freedom instead of rotting in my room all day, and not leaving the house unless if I have to go to work. I want a life. This could be my way to getting it.

It didn’t take us long for it to happen, pregnancy went perfectly and pretty much everything after went perfectly and is still going perfectly (knock on wood).

We haven’t been using any protection since then. We have just been a bit careful with it for a while. Then we started being less and less careful, until we just said f\* it..lets see what happens.

Well nothing happened..it went from: Okay, anytime now… to: What’s going on?

She was breastfeeding for some time, which can make it harder.. but she hasn’t been now for the pas 8+ months, and still nothing is happening.

She went for a cheek up 3-4 months ago, and they saw no issues on the ultrasound. Her doctor said that it could be due to the breastfeeding still and that we should just keep trying. That sometimes it takes long for everything to get back to normal.

She had some issues with some part of her placenta not clearing out. They gave her some sort of an injection to help that process (She would have to get it surgically removed if that wouldn't work). It worked for that.. but we are kind of scared that this injection possibly made it harder for us to make a baby or something... Her doctor said it shouldn't have any effect on that though...

Anyways, she thinks there is still something off on her body or hormones or whatever..and I am thinking that maybe the fault is (also) on my side.

We both decided now to try and increase our chances with the use of supplements, eating better, less alcohol and all that... She already bought something that had good reviews here locally..Its some sort of a vitamin/mineral mix for girls to help with that process or whatever..

But.. which supplements can actually help males with it?  

I was planning on taking: B12 (or B complex in general - I am already taking B12 every day), Vitamin C, Vitamin D (taking it every day already), Zinc, Omega 3 (taking it every day already) and maybe selenium (unsure as it seems you can get too much of it quickly and side effects are not the best.. maybe a low dosage of it..). I am also thinking of reducing my coffee and alcohol intake and trying to workout some more (I do workout, but not as much as I used to..)  and just eat and live healthy in general, which I am trying to do anyways.

Any other supplements or tips on what to do for me (and her).

Also...are any positions better than others for such things?

One of those families is my mom and godmothers best friend (grandma/aunt Joanne), her daughter (Mom/Amanda), and grandson(Max). The grandson is 7 now. He is severely autisic. The child father is still married to the mother, but dad is embarrassed and ashmaned of the child/his behavior and is very hands off. 

Last Christmas, my mom was sitting on the floor playing with my toddler (then 2.5) at my godparents house. Max (then 6) kept trying to chase my toddler and scare him. Max has a remote controlled snake and would purposefully drive it towards my toddler making him cry because my kid was afraid of it. My mom moved my son and her to the entryway, away from the rest of the party and Max kept this up. Finally, my mom snapped at Max and told him to knock it off and leave the kid alone. Max continued. I didn't know up until this point that Max was doing anything to my kid.  It got to the point where my toddler wasn't able to be on the floor and had to be held to keep him away from Max. The mother and father sat with the adults the entire time not checking on their kids (the younger of which is neuro typical and just happily plays with my older kid).

  
Over the weekend, we went to my godparents house for thanksgiving. Knowing now Amadna doesn't keep an eye on her kid (now 7) and that the kid loves to torment my toddler (now 3.5), I made it a point to follow my toddler closely, all while hoping maybe mom would act like a mom or the kids behavior has gotten better. Max was charging at my son trying to scare him. Max was kicking at my son and stopping like 6 inches away. He was name calling. I tried to keep them in different rooms, but Max liked to follow my son around the house. He would start to act up and we would move, only for max to follow a little while later. It didn’t matter if my toddler was on the other side of the room playing or we were playing together on the floor so close our knees were touching while we sat criss cross, max would do this stuff.

Max likes rumbas so my godmother took hers out as a “toy.” Max walked away from it and went to another part of the house; I went to grab a cup of coffee and Max then comes back and snatches it out of my sons hands leaving my 3 year old crying.  I go in and ask what happened and miraculously Amanda decided to come in, too. I told my kid it’s okay and my 3-year-old is crying about how Max’s mean and rude. At this point Max is out of the room and I can see he left the rumba somewhere else – he didn’t want it but didn’t want my son to crawl around after it either. I’m not sure where Amanda was but I agree with my son that it was mean to rip it out of his hands and he is very rude. Amanda did bring it back to my son so I’m assuming she was within ear shot. A few minutes later my mom comes in and asks if Max can have a turn, he was being so bad, and Amanda couldn’t control him.

My son is afraid of the kid. He keeps thinking he’s in trouble when I tell him to stay away from the kid. Max purposely follows my son from room to room. My son went into the 3 seasons room, locked the door and Max demanded he come in so an adult let him in. My son goes to the living room and Max comes in. A few times my son tries to play with max and crawl after the rumba with him and Max would get angry, yell at my kid and tell him he’s being a mean bad boy. I would tell my toddler to let him play and leave him alone, he’s cranky and doesn’t want to share right now, we’d go play somewhere else.  Amanda sat with the grownups while all this is going on. Outside he’s throwing snow and ice at my son. I bring him inside, but he’s upset that the other kids can be outside and doesn’t understand why he’s in trouble. We took frequent breaks to separate him from this kid.

I kept telling my son stay away from him and my son kept feeling like he was in trouble. That’s what I say to him when he’s being naughty to his sister. Later, his sister (8.5) goes off on an angry rant about why she doesn’t like Max to Amanda and aunt Joanne. They both say boys mature slower and aunt Joanne is like isn’t that true? What am I supposed to say it’s my mom’s best friend and I don’t want to rock the boat?! So I’m like yep. Boys don’t mature until they’re like 53 (which is true in some ways but beside the point). Amanda is visibly getting mad. After 6 reasons (all of which had to do with the way he was treating her baby brother) I cut my daughter off and tell her that’s enough. Amanda decides they need to leave. Somewhere in the conversation Amanda tells my daughter Max’s built different and it takes him longer to learn and as long as he’s isn’t hitting anyone, she’s happy. My son wants to go outside. I let him outside alone, they’re leaving. He comes running back crying saying he’s mad at me, he’s scary. He was standing in the driveway which is about 20 cars long. There shouldn’t be anyone there. So I go out and Max is there. Mom is “watching him” out the window. My son tells me he threw leaves at him. Max picks up a pile of leaves and twigs and comes closer to us. I tell him “Do not throw those at him!” He does. I immediately, in my mom voice, tell him “No! that was naughty!” Amanda calls out the door he needs to come in. The kid throws his head back and starts to stomp and scream about my son didn’t make a good choice and I’m like “no! You didn’t! That was a very bad choice!” So he tells me my son is a bad boy and I of course keep yelling at the kid “no! You’re the bad boy! He did nothing to you! You are naughty!” I had enough of the kid acting horrible to my toddler. My 3 year old needed someone to stand up for him. Amanda finally came out of the house and got the kid inside. My son and I go in the back entrance. Amanda manages to get Max in the car and comes back for the younger son. My son runs over and says bye friend to the younger son happy as can be.

Not once did the kid have to apologize for being a terror or even have to acknowledge anything was wrong. The mom was hardly watching the brat. Amanda and aunt Joanne just made excuses for him. They don’t correct him. I have to see them again at Christmas. The kid will probably try and torment my poor toddler yet again and mom will just sit in another room and not care. I’m half tempted at Christmas to just get on the kid right from the start. My kid shouldn’t have to be taught to put up with someone getting right in his face, name calling and swinging at him. My kid shouldn’t have to be afraid just because we must cow tail to this violent kid. Being happy he’s not physically hitting anyone meanwhile he’s throwing twigs and ice isn’t enough for me. Being okay with the fact he’s in my kids’ face is not okay with me. This kid is a lot bigger than my toddler. I don’t want my toddler hurt. Leaves are one thing but ice can seriously hurt sometimes. No one is supposed to correct the kid because “he’s built different.” He charges at my kid and gets right in his face and my 3-year-old is just supposed to accept that because “he’s different.” He doesn’t do any of this to my 8-year-old. In an ideal world, mom would keep an eye on her kid knowing he has issues. Clearly, it’s not an ideal world. I was hoping after a year he would be acting better or mom would have learned to keep an eye on the kid but neither of those seem to be the case.",0,1733258696.0,Parenting,5,0.5,False

# His life was deeply rooted in his family, animals, and land.

His workday began at dawn with the rising sun and ended when the sun dipped below the horizon. Sundays and holidays were days when he worked fewer hours so he could attend his local church and enjoy a round of cards at the bar, exchanging updates and news. He never felt the need for periodic breaks to unwind or recharge. Even though his work was physically demanding, and livestock alignments and harvest mishaps caused mental concern, he never took sick days. His honest earnings, while meagre, provided a comfortable lifestyle, allowing him to educate his children and care for his family.

# Daily Sustenance and Simple Pleasures

His lunch breaks were a treat, thanks to the simplicity and genuineness of the ingredients. The delicious homemade pies and hearty sandwiches, wrapped in cloth, were satisfying and made with unaltered ingredients. In winter, his thermos kept coffee warm, while in summer, it held a cool orange drink to quench his thirst. He didn’t throw away containers and wrappers but brought them home to be washed and reused.

Produce was local, ripe, and flavourful but not available year-round. The community would take the seasonal abundance and preserve it with sugar, olive oil, and salt for the scarce winter months. Food didn’t come with barcodes or mysterious ingredients and best-before dates were in the mind of the preparer. Expiry dates only occurred on those rare occasions when a jar became contaminated and started to smell funny.

# Technology and Sustainability

While nothing was high-tech or fancy, everything was durable and repairable. If something broke, a skilled mechanic with the right service manuals could fix it. If a part was no longer available, it could be machined.

He found joy and solace in the chirping of birds, the buzz of insects, and the presence of creatures that shared his land. When he wasn’t shuffling a deck of cards, his favourite pastime was aiming stones at a makeshift target while silently planning for the next tilling, sowing, or harvest.

# Community and Connection

His social life revolved around the local church and the friends he met on Sundays at the bar. His sources of information were the local newspaper, the pulpit, and the town grapevine. His online shopping consisted of picking up the phone to call the local shop to inquire about product availability or delivery times. Same-day delivery would only happen if he went to pick up an item himself; next-day delivery would occur only if it coincided with the delivery man’s weekly route.

# Family Life and Entertainment

Dinner was a time for heartfelt conversations with his wife and children about their day. Problems were shared, and achievements were celebrated. The family gathered around their TV, which had a few channels that transmitted for several hours each evening. The broadcasts were local, truthful, and positive, prioritizing community values over audience share.

# Community Spirit

The church bells were the community’s alert system that brought out the community in times of happiness or sadness. Whether to celebrate or to grieve, the community came together whenever the situation called for it. They set aside any differences for these occasions and many times, these events provided an opportunity for enemies to bury the hatchet and revive their friendships.

# The Changing Times

He and his wife taught their children everything they knew and worked hard to educate them so they would have more options and opportunities. However, the children believed that life beyond the farm was better… They left for factory jobs or desk jobs… *And…*",1,1733258187.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1h5xg5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/doctorsUK/comments/1h5xg5v/when_i_become_a_consultant/,When I become a consultant...,"I had a stressful day so now I'm relaxing with a beer and dreaming of my future career as a consultant (GMC look away). 

I'm 5 and a bit years from CCT in a niche speciality. I've decided that when I CCT, I'm going to become the ""fun"" consultant.

Therefore, my manifesto includes:

1. My department will have relevant memes all over the place and I will run language lessons to teach gen - (I don't even know what I am now, millenial, alpha, or Z?) slang. 

2.Furthermore, non-rigourous documentation will be banned, and a clear interdisciplinary (between medical specialties, fuck PAs and other noctors) approach will be promoted. 

3. The stuffy old consultants (only 2 of them at the moment) will have to get with the programme or STFU. 

4. Also, all resident doctors will get daily coffees from me in return for gossip. 

---

I'm already endearing myself to the rank and file in the department, most of whom are middle-aged women (helped by the fact that I'm a man and look younger than I am; but don't ID me), so I should have a good support base for my coup when the time comes. 

Indulge me, GMC slaves of resident, and tell me what are your opinions of my plan, and if you have any of your own?

My current thought process is to just export the folder as a catalog with images from the laptop and import that on the mini then do the full card dump there. I would have to manually sync presets changes that way but overall it works well enough.

My question is is there a better way to handle this? Is there some way to sync presets when I make an adjustment to them on the mini?

Edit - I wasn’t clear I apologize. I’ll edit a few pics at halftime to email out and then when I get home I’ll do the complete game edits.

For the last decade my brother has been in a cycle of being employed briefly, finding reasons to hate everyone he works with, losing his job, and spending months calling my mom and I names if either of us brings up getting a job. “You’re a fucking cunt” type of stuff. “I fucking hate you.” “You’re a fucking bitch.” Etc. Long, drawn out tirades that will last days of him throwing fits and calling names, slamming doors, and refusing to discuss anything rationally.

He won’t contribute to bills. He won’t contribute to groceries. He doesn’t do his own dishes, and half the time he throws his garbage down on the counter or floor instead of just throwing it in the trash. He just wants to be in his room on his xbox.

My mom doesn’t like how he acts, but if I ever push back against him she expresses very firmly that I’m wrong to do so because if I would just be quiet and not set him off it would be better. Because I know when I say something that he’s going to fly off the handle and I need to keep the peace. She also says what he’s doing isn’t abuse.

Recently, my brother threw a fit because I wanted pie and it had sugar in it. He doesn’t eat sugar anymore. It turned into DAYS of him yelling, slamming doors, and then giving the silent treatment. Because “no one ever thinks of him.” Now, on that same day my mother also made homemade chicken pot pie, a creamy sort of biscuits and gravy dish, and there was a roast+veggies in the fridge from the day before. There were apples, oranges, and bananas. There were even potato chips! He was not deprived. I even buy him his own tins of coffee every week (I buy myself a single tin and make it last the two weeks between my paychecks).

The day after the pie, I was in the kitchen making my morning coffee when he came through slamming doors and giving the silent treatment, and I finally snapped. I said that he’s a 41 year old man, and that I have to take care of EVERYTHING else for him and that I shouldn’t be responsible for his snacks too. That I’m allowed to have a pie from ingredients I bought with money I worked for. I also snapped he needs to “Get a fucking job so he can buy his own shit and contribute.”

He and my mother are saying I emasculated him and that I can’t say stuff like that to a man. He threw an even bigger fit and started slamming around the house saying he was going to sell all the tools and leave.

I regret swearing, but don’t think it’s unfair or rude to remind him that he’s a grown man and needs to support himself. I want to leave, but I can’t run off and be homeless with my daughter in winter and when I try to save up money from my paycheck I get treated like I’m being greedy somehow.

I’m barely surviving (financially) and I’m breaking down (physically and emotionally), and I’m starting to think I’m the asshole.

1h5xaqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1h5xaqj/the_sun_suckers/,THE SUN SUCKERS,"Some things will always have some form of metaphysical power over others. Death, Love, and Time are examples of this. Yet, one odd case of this is the concept of Currency. It’s made up via the culture that made it. Why does it have power? Because the culture says so. For those who’d say that money isn't needed in our hyper-evolved future, you may not want to read the rest of this. It’d be awful to pop that optimistic bubble formed over your mind. 

In the far far future, money has its strongest stranglehold over the universe. People fight desperately for resources, well, people working for corporations. The non-corporate-aligned folk try to live peacefully in their own little pockets of space (usually unsuccessfully). 

One popular racket is Sun Forming, the biggest in this business being SunCore Industries. They’ve produced over ten billion stars over the universe, most aren’t even aware they live near a crafted star. 

This is where we find Frendrick. Well, more accurately, his name is Frendrick Daev Q’ohQ’oh Puhfs XVII. But, Frendrick works best for him. 

It was another average day for him on the ranch. He walked out to see the blazing blue stars outside.  He stepped out onto the small world he lived on. He took his daily morning walk around the rock, which only took about ten minutes. He examined the Screw Berries. They were very popular with those into hallucinogens. One reason was because they were able to make you hallucinate other timelines, the other was that they tasted very good. Their flavor was almost indistinguishable from raspberries. Most eat them unaware of what they are, which usually ends with the person digesting the berry to ask everyone if they’re still themselves for days after the fact.

He sat in a rocking chair, drinking out of an almost comically small cup of coffee. He basked in the blue sunlight. He cracked his back in the chair and leaned back. To him this was perfection.

He stared up into the starry sky. He knew this sky like the back of his hand, yet, that large black dot was new. It moved closer and closer to the sun. Now, maybe he was crazy, but he swore he saw something like a large vacuum cleaner pop out of the black dot. In a matter of seconds, the sun was cartoonishly sucked into this small black dot. 

Frendrick sat slacked jawed. The black dot got closer and closer until it revealed itself to be ship with a yellowish off-white paint job. A white hazmat-like suit walked out and pointed at Frendrick.

“Are you living on this moon?” the suit asked.

Frendrick only nodded.

“You do know that you were orbiting a SunCore star illegally, right?” the suit said. “You’re lucky this wasn’t a generational farm or something, that would’ve been bad for your descendants.”

The person in the hazmat suit then hoisted up their pants and gave a small salute to Frendrick. “Welp, have a good existence. You owe about ten million to SunCore, and have about six half rotations to pay that.” They then proceeded to walk back into their ship and blast off. A packet of paper was launched out the back of the ship and landed in front of Frendrick. 

It was a thick packet of paper with a large SunCorp logo on the first page. He leaned over and grabbed it. Though, it was hard to read the packet without a sun.

I’m new to this so please bear with me. Just bought a micra on Black Friday and need a grinder to go with it. 
There’s a coffee shop close to my house that has coffee I love and they use a big marzocco + Mahlkonig (I think the EK43) so I would like a flavour close to that. I’m not a coffee expert but so please bear with me. Budget would be around 500-700€. 

Options I’ve been looking at are:
- Niche Zero (I live in Portugal so the taxes are annoying me a lot since it will end up at 750€)
- Lagom Casa with the 65’s (looks great, not sure about the motor, not many reviews, from the videos I watched the grinding sound is not great)
- Sculptor 064s (I heard the cleaning process is horrible so I’m really not sure)

Not interested in Eureka or DF’s. 
Would maybe stretch the budget to a Philos/Pico but those look huge so I’m not in love with them..

He admitted to me that he was a serial rapist and that he enjoyed it. Manipulator and liar too; and never a great boyfriend. He was decent at best.  No need to say that didn’t last much longer. But I haven’t found any help for it after 2+ years, and I just desperately need someone who kinda knows him to talk to? Or I just need some kind of closure, which I for SURE won’t get from him.  

Why I’m considering his ex is mostly because he told me to never text her or to ever contact her - and knowing him that means she’s got something about him. I followed her on insta earlier (or more like I requested to) and she accepted within an hour. I do believe she knows who I am, and there’s a photo of him pretty far down on my feed. Hopefully she’s connected the dots. 

My idea is simply to say that the relationship with him has ruined a lot for me mentally, and to offer her simply a coffee date and some shit talk. We could get to know each other, and maybe even help each other with any remaining damage from him.

1h5x5p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CRM/comments/1h5x5p7/is_there_a_term_for_activities_before_a_crm_take/,Is there a term for activities before a CRM take place?,"After reviewing dozens of CRM software,  I've reached a conclusion: It feels that there might be some kind of software I'm not aware of, that does something like CRM but in a previous phase, say ""prospecting phase"" when you have 1 if any information about the client.

For example: Lets say I'm prospecting hundreds of little SME all over my country, just by looking to their homesite, trying to get at best an email, or a contact form, or a SM contact. I only have like the name of the company and how I could find the contact (say, Instagram handle). I contact them, and I only know I want to contact them again in 1 week.

Maybe back in the day, one could pull of the or ""Yellow pages"" or whatever book with company information was out there, and they only had two information pieces: Their number and the name of the company (and the address is many cases, which was mostly irrelevant for the process of phone prospecting, and too early to waste time typing it while prospecting).

Each single CRM out there, has like 150 fields for each lead. Most have like 2-3 tabs for a single contact. So clearly it feels that all CRM are meant for either a different type of business (like a car dealership, that gets the full info from their clients when they are presently in the dealership), or a sales guy that physically jumps from a company to another company.

I've seen like a VERY common field in almost ALL CRM: ""Deal Value"" or ""Lead Value"", and in most cases, if not all, as a **REQUIRED** field. This says a lot about what kind of software we are talking about. Yeah, the person is interested in a car that costs $20K, I can fill that value with $20K. 

But say if I'm contacting a little solopreneur coffee shop, and I'm only looking to know more about them. I don't even know if I'm going to even sell them a bag of coffee or a bag of napkins at best, or maybe become their main distributor for all things hospitality. From $10 to $10K, who knows? And I'm not that type that thinks: ""just put whatever it comes to your mind to fill the gap"". That gap should not exist for many reasons in the kind of software I'm talking about.

Perhaps the CRM word has been in my mind for too long. I've used them in businesses that made sense to use a CRM for more than a decade.

But then I've found scenarios where a CRM did not make sense, but any software made sense at all apart from an Outlook. But with a team working on this, and outlook for control and management was clearly insufficient. And the sales guys would not be willing to spend more time in anything more than a Outlook-type, where they typed in the Company name, the contact method (Instagram Handle) and the next-day contact. 

And the same for an Excel/Google Drive. Controlling one guy or solopreneuring, could be possible, but controlling 5 guys doing this, its a time waster.

But maybe there is another type of software that is similar to a CRM in the ""Client part"" but not in the whole client management process. Say a Client Prospecting Manager, CPM?",1,1733257471.0,CRM,0,1.0,False

I would absolutely never expect someone to waive board regardless of the circumstances, so I want to make a point to get her and her mother something nice for Christmas to show my appreciation (that isn’t cash as it’s been made very clear they don’t want payment, just to get the horses somewhere better).

It is easy to find copycat recipes and then adjust them to your needs. When I found one for Lawry's I was happy, especially since the sugar can be eliminated and far less salt added.  I adjusted the recipe and use it on chicken, beef and pork and veggies. personally I do not think it does well on seafood but that is a preference.

Copycat Lawry's Seasoning Salt (adjusted version):
1 tablespoon salt (pink, grey or sea only)
1 teaspoon sugar (I don't use any but the recipe and the original commercial brand does)
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon corn starch (I use organic)

I usually multiply this recipe by 8 so it lasts longer. The amount of salt and sugar is completely adjustable to individual needs. Only a small amount is needed to season most meats so it cuts way down on sodium.

The dehydration part:
Dehydrating plain red sweet peppers, turmeric, garlic and onions are so much tastier than using regular produce. If you use the oven instead of dehydrator, it works just fine. Grind in blender coffee grinder.

There's plenty of advice and videos on tools and techniques, but I've struggled to find much info on what wood I should be using and decent retailers to use. So I'm hoping to get some help here.

Softwood Vs Hardwood? Is it worth going for softwood for a beginner project, to reduce costs while learning (and probably making mistakes), or is it better to go for hardwood and accept it'll be a bit rough, but it'll last longer. Or, is softwood, like redwood, perfectly fine for this sort of project?

PSE/PAR? I don't have access to any machinery to plane timber myself, so, is PSE/PAR necessary, or are there other types of timber that will do the job fine. 

Where to buy? I've seen advice saying to generally avoid places like B&Q, and instead order from local timber merchants. I also don't have access to a car, so delivery would be necessary. I couldn't find much info on finding good places to order softwood (if that's the right timber to go for), am I looking for any joinery grade timber, or is there anything more specific to look out for?

What dimensions to buy? Are there minimal widths/depths to go with? For length, most timber sellers seem to sell by lengths of ""at least X metres"", is this something where you can specify the lengths you want or you have to plan around the possible lengths you'd get?

If you've made it this far, thank you very much and all advice is greatly appreciated.",2,1733257414.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

Last minute my partner found a coffee maker on sale for Black Friday and got it for me, forgetting to check the box for discrete packaging. Since I work from home, I had to bring it inside when it was delivered. My partner found out that I saw what it was but it led to a good moment of appreciation between us. 

So here’s where my tendency to mess things up comes in. Being the person I am, I decided to type in the model number of the machine she bought me. It looked pretty solid, sitting at 4.3/5 stars on Amazon. But that’s when I found out from the reviews that owners of that specific model almost universally encountered a major leaking problem. A similar model from the same brand at a comparable price sits at 4.6/5 stars and there are almost no complaints in the reviews about any aspect of the machine.

 I don’t know what to do because now I’m stuck on it. The last thing I want to do is crap on the surprise for me, and that’s exactly what bringing it up will do, I think. However at the same time, staying quiet is going to lead to the inevitable disappointment of having a product that’s leaky and defective.

6 am: We are up, brushing our teeth, chomping on a banana and washing it down with some milk as we head out to the park. First thing wife notices is, there are less people than our prior trips.

7 am: While walking I queue up Tiana's Bayou Adventure. Refreshing every few seconds and get group 37. Rented a stroller as we are now a stroller less family and stood in line to get into the park. Mobile ordered breakfast from Galactic Grill and treats from Jolly Holiday and corndogs to snack on later.

8 am to 10 am: Rope dropped Space Mountain, then to Buzz Lightyear, grabbed breakfast, hit Autopia and then went to realign my back at Matterhorn. personal tip. lean forwards. Matterhorn replaces Space Mountain as the favorite ride for the kids. I went to pick up the Corndogs and Jolly Holiday order and get in the Princess meet and greet line, while wife and kids rode Pinnochio, 5 year old changed into princess dress and then joined me in line.

10 am to 1pm: After meeting the princesses and running into Gaston, we head to star wars for some blue milk, frog blood and eggs. 7 year old laments the frog eggs and blood wasnt added to the green milk instead. Hit up Smugglers Run and then waited in line for Rise as we munched on our corndogs. Noticed that we had a call back time of 10:57 (?) for Tiana's Bayou. Also mobile ordered a Lobster Roll for the adults and beignets from Mint Julep. No Gingerbread Popcorn bucket at Harbor's Galley. If we were to get it, that was the one we were going to do with the gingerbread cookies. But while we saw a lot of Elf Mickey sippy cups we saw zero Gingerbread Popcorn Buckets.

1pm to 2:30 pm: Tiana's Bayou is now officially the kids favorite ride, replacing Matterhorn. Ponchos are laid out by the trash cans near the ride photo area. then we hit up the Pooh ride that was down earlier but back up when we exited Tiana's Bayou. 

2:30 to 4:30 pm: This is where I planned the kids to nap. They had a free choice of rides or rest. They chose rest. After picking up food and drinks, we headed to main street, caught the tail end of the parade from the back while the kids munched on some snacks and as the crowd dispersed we grabbed seats along main street with a view of the christmas tree. The kids slept while wife and I stared into the abyss of our phones. We also ate, recharged ourselves with coffee and I mobile ordered dinner for the kids to eat while watching the parade.

4:30 to 6:00 pm: Kids are up, we have time for a ride before the Christmas tree lighting and we book it to Astro Orbiter. Watch the tree lighting, kids eat dinner and we watch the parade. I would say this is where my two favorite moments happened. 7 year old was staring at the tree and when the lights go on, under his breath I hear him go ""wow."" during the parade snow white was blowing kisses and my 5 year old blew a kiss back and was blowing kisses to every princess that came afterwards.

6:00 to 7:30 pm: Jungle cruise and Pirates. I swear coming out of Pirates it is always bored parents walking with kids singing ""A pirates life for me""

7:30 to 9:30 pm: We watch the Castle Lighting and then I park myself in front of the castle for fireworks while wife and kids head off to Peter Pan, Carousel, Dumbo and Casey Jr. Get a call from wife saying the kids are hungry but dont want pizza. Mobile ordered some chicken and as soon as the wife and kids arrive to my spot, I speed walk to my order and back.

9:30 to 11:30 pm: After fireworks we head to Matterhorn again and sorry Tiana, but Matterhorn is back in the #1 spot. Then we do small world to close out the day. 7 year old says 2 more rides so we chose the 2 with the shortest lines. Snow white and Toads Adventure. We spot Minnie on the way out for a photo and autograph.

I am new to the concept of IC so I wanted to go over my journey thus far and get any advice/direction anyone might have based on your experiences. I am 25 and didn’t have any UTIs until a few months ago. It developed after a sexual encounter (and it was like exactly 24 hours after) and I remember showing positive leukocytes and nitrites on dipstick tests. I stupidly didn’t go get a culture because I didn’t realize the importance of it. I took 5 days of Macrobid and ended up with raging UTI symptoms 6 days after ending that Macrobid course. I was put on 7 days of Cipro which seemed to knock it out, but ever since then, I’ve noticed mild UTI like symptoms flare every on e in a while. The first UTI was in early September, now it’s December and I notice if I drink too much coffee or alcohol, or sometimes after sex I will get very very mild urethral discomfort and white flakes visible in my urine. I have positive leukocytes at times on dipsticks but no nitrites— and I have had urine cultures since this started that have all been negative. After the first UTI reared it’s ugly head a second time I started taking D-Mannose and I haven’t felt any full-blown UTI symptoms since. 

I also feel it’s worth mentioning that I’ve always suspected I had pelvic floor dysfunction. I started out having pretty bad pain during intercourse for the first 30 seconds or so, and now I notice the pain is much milder and only happens with certain positions. I do also notice soreness after sex sometimes and I’ve always had issues with having a “shy bladder” or not being able to relax my pelvic floor easily. Do these things (bladder issues and pelvic floor issues) usually coincide? Any advice on where to go from here would be greatly appreciated. Not sure if I need to see a specialist or not.
