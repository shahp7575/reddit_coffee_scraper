1hn6iq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1hn6iq9/how_sensitive_to_fructans_is_normal_for_ibs/,How sensitive to fructans is normal for IBS?,"Long story short, after going through multiple terrible gastroenterologists and having 20 years worth of testing (all negative minus chronic low iron, high bilirubin) this year I finally discovered with the help of an email chain from the Ohio State Wexner that I likely have some form of IBS. Still waiting to get in since the wait list is 12 months long. Ridiculous. Anywho, I've been trying to quite literally stay alive (mental health waivering along with my BMI of barely 18) so thought I'd throw a hail mary onto the good ole FODMAPS forum. Here's a two-in-one part.

PART 1:
So after doing the elimination diet a few months back, I determined fructans was my only trigger. Which was good and bad. Started tracking ingredients, download Monash and Fig and, despite several issues on Fig and some confusing entries on Monash (Coconut milk with inulins was the confusing one today), things have been going rather smooth in avoiding fructans. 

But wow oh wow, do I have a low threshold (with other issues I'll divulge later). I've had issues with items where molasses is the last of several ingredients. Chocolate is barely clinging on for dear life (I can still eat the ridiculously expensive Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Go Macro bars), but I'm shocked. Garlic infused olive oils, including ones SPECIFICALLY for FODMAP sensitivity, are a no go. Anyone else have this level of struggle and are only diagnoses with IBS?

PART 2:
I'm struggling to maintain weight and consume enough calories to gain weight and fiber to prevent myself from constantly being in a state of bowel pain and diarrhea. It's pretty shocking. And keep in mind, I promise you friends, I have obsessively eliminated fructans and I feel confident this is not FODMAP related. I try to eat exorbitant amounts of fiber, but ironically, fibrous foods tender to not be calorie dense. So I find myself in a situation of gorging myself at mealtimes (not allowed to eat outside of lunch break at work) or eating calorie dense OR fibrous foods. So what's the deal? Anybody have any secrets? Working out ground to a halt. Coffee has been backed down to 4 ounces. Not sure I can voluntarily give any more ground on quality of life here.

She tried to do everything right but instead they want to throw her out. She wants to stay and wants to feed herself and because she's not doing it ""legally"" people will just openly hate her (you guys just sailed over here and shot the natives and then came over to Africa and took people over but I'll leave that for rant 3).

When did everyone become such a narc? Love your neighbours and help them not get in their way and tell them that they are the problem.

I’m feeling really confused and hurt, and I don’t know how to handle this situation. I’m 26F, and I’ve been with my boyfriend (28M) for two years. Our relationship has had its ups and downs, but I always believed we had a good connection and could work through anything together.

Last night, we got into an argument over something so simple. it started with me buying the wrong brand of coffee. The disagreement escalated quickly, with him yelling at me. He has a habit of raising his voice when he’s upset, but this time, things went too far. When I tried to stand my ground and told him to stop yelling, he slapped me. It wasn’t a small slap becase it hurt and I was too shocked to respond.

He immediately looked startled but didn’t apologize. Instead, he said I made him angry and left the house. I spent the rest of the night replaying everything in my head questioning whether I somehow caused it. When he came back this morning he acted as if nothing had happened. I don’t know if he’s pretending it didn’t happen or if he thinks it’s okay to brush it under the rug. Either way I’ve been feeling emotionally torn and unsure of how to bring it up without starting another fight.

I don’t know how to address this without making things worse. I care about him, but I also feel scared which is a new and unsettling feeling. I don’t want to ignore what happened because it makes me uncomfortable but I also don’t know how to confront him in a way that leads to a productive conversation.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? How can I approach him about what happened in a way that gets to the root of it without making things spiral further? I’d appreciate any advice Thank you.",2,1735271782.0,relationship_advice,18,1.0,False

I have seen Midsummer and the Copland Dances this year as well. Maybe it’s because I trained and danced in the 90s-00s and so my frame of reference is skewed, but it is seems to me that the quality of training has declined, and by extension the quality of the dancers in the company. List of observations:

1 - Unfinished moves. Dancers rushing through steps, looks like mush, can’t distinguish key forms/lines since nothing is held. Boisson was particularly guilty of this tonight. But I noticed it across the board.



2 - Floppy feet, turned in standing legs or turned in moving into next move. During dance of Sugarplum in opening of second act, Gerrity was not even close to having her right foot properly turned out while moving downstage turning en sedans. Most dancers entering a grand jete also stepped heel-toe with turned in right foot. Noticed it in snow and flowers as well. This was for almost all the men and women except Mackinnon and Jones. 


2.5 - generally it looked like there is a trend with the dancers wearing short vamp, super square boxy pointe shoes which make their feet look sickled and weird. Again, except Mackinnon and Jones. Not sure if this a new aesthetic trend that’s developed in the company echo chamber, but someone should really tell these dancers to get supportive shoes. 


3 - Sill was the first time I didn’t like a conductor - volume was too low - crescendos didn’t hit. It seemed like he pushed brass / percussion instead of woodwinds and I really did not like the arrangement. Also odd choices during the course of the show for allegro v adagio - and I’m pretty sure a horn made a mistake during Pas. 


4 - Suozzi, Tompkins and McCurdy were an absolute joy and they thoroughly carried the show. 


5 - Staging changes to Party Scene didn’t slap. I really felt like the scene was off? Idk what changes were made, but totally fell flat. 


6 - Lighting design. So weird there was a general lack of spot lighting on the Prince particularly during the first act battle and snow. He didn’t have a spot during his big reveal and when it came on, it missed the cue. I felt bad for McCurdy because he’s truly quite a talented young dancer.


7 - Low energy. I didn’t see a triple pirouette, steady series of turns in second, or proper turns in attitude, nothing. Dancers kind of looked bored, and that energy translated. No curtain calls.


Overall, I’m pretty unimpressed with this years crop of dancers at NYCB. There are certainly stand outs, Meijia, Nadon, Woodward, Von Enck, Chan, and Peck of course - but the up and coming talent just doesn’t really have it. For context, the dancers of my generation (I was training and dancing while they were principals) Weiss, Karowski, Gold, Higgins, Askegard, Boal and Somogyi just to name a few, and watching them made me feel like I had something to aspire to. I am not moved in the same way. 


So what do. this community think not only of the dancers, but also Jonathan Stafford as an artistic director? I am genuinely SO curious.

--------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a bright, white smile, many people look for convenient and effective solutions. One popular option is Power Swabs, a teeth whitening product that claims to deliver fast results without the mess often associated with traditional whitening methods. But, the question remains: do Power Swabs really whiten teeth? Let's take a closer look at their effectiveness and how they work.

### What are Power Swabs?

Power Swabs are a teeth whitening system that utilizes a unique swab applicator. Each kit typically contains multiple individually wrapped swabs that are pre-soaked with a whitening solution. The idea is that you can easily apply the solution directly to your teeth while also preventing gum irritation, a common issue with many whitening products.

### How Do They Work?

The formula in Power Swabs contains a blend of cleaning and whitening agents specifically designed to break down stains on your teeth. When you use the swabs, you simply rub the solution on your teeth for a couple of minutes. Here's why the application method is significant:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Direct Application:** The swabs allow you to target specific areas of discoloration easily.
- **No Strips or Trays:** Unlike traditional whitening strips or trays, the swabs don’t slip or slide, making them more user-friendly.
- **Quick Action:** Users often report seeing results after just one application.

### What Results Can You Expect?

Power Swabs claim to provide significant whitening effects quickly—often within a few days. Many users experience noticeable brightness after just one use. In fact, it's said that some users may see up to two shades whiter results after the first application. The efficacy can vary from person to person extensively based on the original shade of your teeth and the type of stains present.

### Customer Feedback

To better understand if Power Swabs work as advertised, it's helpful to look at customer feedback. Many users find that:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Convenience:** Users appreciate the easy-to-use nature of the swabs, especially for those with busy lifestyles.
- **No Sensitivity:** One of the biggest advantages noted is that many people do not experience tooth sensitivity after using Power Swabs, unlike with some gel-based whitening products.
- **Effective for Surface Stains:** Customers often mention that Power Swabs work well on surface stains from coffee, tea, and smoking.

### Considerations Before Use

While Power Swabs offer an attractive option for teeth whitening, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- **Permanent Stains:** They may not be effective for deeper, intrinsic stains that require professional treatment.
- **Consistency:** For optimal results, consistency is key. Users might need to repeat the process regularly to maintain brightness.
- **Individual Results:** Not everyone will achieve the same level of whitening, so manage your expectations accordingly.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Power Swabs are priced competitively compared to other whitening methods. When considering the cost of in-office dental whitening treatments, Power Swabs offer a more affordable alternative without sacrificing too much in effectiveness. Additionally, unlike some take-home systems, there’s no need for special trays or dentist visits, making it a practical choice.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Final Thoughts

Power Swabs appear to be an effective solution for those looking to quickly whiten their teeth at home. Their ease of use, minimal sensitivity, and quick results make them an appealing option for many. However, as with any whitening product, individual experiences may vary. If you’re considering Power Swabs, it's wise to evaluate your own needs and potentially consult with a dental professional, especially if you have specific dental concerns.

Ultimately, if you're looking for a simple way to remove surface stains and improve your smile without the hassle of traditional whitening methods, Power Swabs might be worth trying!

Comparing Power Swabs to Traditional Teeth Whitening Methods
------------------------------------------------------------

When considering teeth whitening options, it’s important to look at the various methods available. Many people are now turning to power swabs, a newer technique, while traditional methods like whitening strips, trays, and in-office treatments remain popular. Each method has its own pros and cons, making it essential to compare them carefully.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Power Swabs

Power swabs offer a unique approach to teeth whitening. Instead of using bleach like many traditional methods, these swabs contain a special formula that lifts stains and whitens teeth in a gentle manner. Here’s what you should know:

- **Easy to Use:** Power swabs come in pre-soaked pads, making them convenient for on-the-go applications.
- **Less Sensitivity:** Many users report experiencing significantly less tooth sensitivity compared to traditional whitening processes that use harsh chemicals.
- **Quick Results:** The results can often be seen in just one application, with many claiming noticeable improvements after just a few days.
- **Non-Messy:** Unlike trays or strips that can slide around in your mouth, swabs apply directly to your teeth, minimizing mess.

### Traditional Teeth Whitening Methods

Traditional teeth whitening methods include products like whitening strips, trays, and professional treatments from dentists. These methods have been around for a long time and tend to work well for many people. Here’s a breakdown of their features:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Strips:** These are thin, flexible strips coated with a whitening gel. They are easy to use but may not fit everyone's teeth perfectly, potentially leading to uneven results.
- **Whitening Trays:** Custom or over-the-counter trays can be filled with a whitening gel. They can provide good results, but they might require longer wear times and can be uncomfortable.
- **In-Office Treatments:** Professional whitening, usually performed by a dentist, offers the fastest and most dramatic results. However, this method is typically much more expensive and may result in increased sensitivity.

### Effectiveness

Both power swabs and traditional methods can yield effective results, but their efficiency varies:

- **Time Frame:** Power swabs can show results quickly, often in less than a week. In contrast, traditional methods, especially strips or trays, might take several weeks to achieve the desired brightness.
- **Long-Lasting Results:** While power swabs provide quick results, users often wonder how long those results will last. Traditional whitening methods can offer longer-lasting changes, particularly in-office procedures.

### Cost Comparison

When evaluating cost, you’ll find that power swabs are generally less expensive compared to in-office dental whitening. Here’s a quick look:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Power Swabs:** Typically priced lower than professional treatments, providing a cost-effective option for at-home whitening.
- **Whitening Strips/Trays:** These can range in price, but over time, they can add up, especially if repeated treatments are needed.
- **In-Office Whitening:** While this method gives the best results, it is often the most costly, with treatments varying widely based on location and dental professional.

### Sensitivity Issues

One of the most common concerns with traditional teeth whitening methods is tooth sensitivity. Many people find that whitening strips or bleach trays can cause temporary discomfort. On the other hand, power swabs tend to cause less discomfort, making them an appealing option for those with sensitive teeth.

### Convenience

Power swabs stand out in terms of convenience. They require no mixing, hassle-free application, and no waiting for the gel to take effect. Traditional whitening methods, while effective, often involve a more complex process that some users may find tedious.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
In the quest for brighter teeth, understanding the various options available is key. By weighing the pros and cons of power swabs against traditional teeth whitening methods, you can make a more informed decision that aligns with your personal needs and lifestyle.

Ultimately, whether you choose power swabs or one of the traditional methods, your goal is the same: achieving a whiter, brighter smile that you can show off with confidence. Choose wisely and consider what matters most to you—time, cost, comfort, or effectiveness. The right choice is out there for you!

### Conclusion

The effectiveness of Power Swabs as a teeth whitening solution has garnered significant attention. Many users report noticeable results within just minutes of application, praising the ease of use and the convenience of being able to whiten at home without a dentist's visit. This method’s innovative foam applicator targets tough stains while being gentler on enamel compared to traditional whitening treatments. Users appreciate that Power Swabs not only brighten their smiles but also keep them feeling fresher throughout the day.

When compared to traditional teeth whitening methods, such as strips or professional treatments, Power Swabs offer unique advantages. The fast results and non-irritating formula appeal to those who may find other treatments uncomfortable or too time-consuming. Moreover, while some might question the long-term efficacy of Power Swabs, many find them effective enough for periodic use, especially before special occasions.

Ultimately, the choice between Power Swabs and traditional whitening methods comes down to personal preferences and lifestyles. If you’re looking for a quick and easy solution that fits into a busy schedule, Power Swabs may be worth trying. However, for those seeking more dramatic, long-lasting results, investing in professional treatments might still be the best route. Regardless of your choice, maintaining good oral hygiene and regular dental check-ups will always be key to achieving and maintaining a bright, healthy smile.

-----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to decorating your space, black decor stands out as a bold choice. It's elegant, modern, and can create a sophisticated ambiance in any room. However, the right accessories are essential to ensure that your black decor isn't just striking, but also harmonious and inviting. Let’s explore some fantastic accessories that enhance black decor and elevate your interior design.

### Colorful Accents

One of the best ways to enhance black decor is by incorporating colorful accents. Here are a few ideas:

- **Bright Cushions:** Add bright cushions in colors like yellow, teal, or red to your black sofa. This will instantly create a lively contrast and make the space feel cozy.
- **Artwork:** Frame colorful paintings or prints to hang on black walls. Art can add depth and personality to your decor.
- **Rugs:** Consider a vibrant area rug with a bold pattern. It not only adds warmth underfoot but creates interest in the room.

### Metal Accents

Using metallic accessories can add a touch of glamour to your black decor. Here are some materials to consider:

- **Gold:** Gold accessories, like picture frames or decorative bowls, can bring a regal feel to your space.
- **Silver:** Silver lamps or vases add a modern touch without overpowering the black elements.
- **Copper:** Copper fixtures or decor pieces can introduce warmth and a hint of vintage charm.

### Natural Elements

Natural accessories can enhance the sophistication of black decor:

- **Plants:** Green plants, such as succulents or ferns, create a refreshing contrast with black. Opt for chic pots in materials like ceramic or terracotta.
- **Wood:** Use wooden accessories, such as shelves or coffee tables, to bring warmth and texture to your space.
- **Textiles:** Consider natural fabrics like linen or cotton in your throws or curtains. They add softness against the boldness of black.

### Lighting Fixtures

The right lighting can make or break the look of your black decor:

- **Chandeliers:** A statement chandelier in a metallic finish can create an eye-catching focal point in the room.
- **Floor Lamps:** Elegant floor lamps not only provide light but can also serve as decorative pieces. Choose ones with unique shapes or finishes.
- **String Lights:** For a whimsical touch, consider string lights in the corners of your rooms. They provide soft lighting and invite a cozy atmosphere.

### Textures and Patterns

Using different textures and patterns can add dimension to your black decor:

- **Leather:** Leather accessories, such as ottomans or chairs, can provide an edgy vibe.
- **Glass:** Clear or colored glass items, such as vases or candle holders, can add shine and refinement to your space.
- **Patterns:** Mix and match patterned accessories, like throw pillows, curtains, or wall art, to create visual interest without overwhelming the black base.

### Functional Accessories

In addition to aesthetics, functional accessories can also play a role in enhancing your black decor:

- **Shelving Units:** Open shelving in wood or metal allows you to display decorative items while maintaining an open feel in your space.
- **Storage Baskets:** Woven baskets can store items while adding texture and warmth.
- **Mirrors:** A large mirror can reflect light and give the illusion of more space, making your decor feel more expansive.

Black decor can evoke a powerful and chic atmosphere when paired with the right accessories. By introducing colorful accents, metallic finishes, natural elements, effective lighting, varied textures, and functional accessories, you can create an inviting space that reflects your personal style. Embrace the boldness of black and let these accessories elevate your home decor.

Color Pairings: Choosing the Right Hues to Complement Black Home Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When designing your home, black decor can create a stunning and modern aesthetic. However, finding the right color pairings to complement this bold choice is essential. Black can be a dominant color, and the right hues can enhance its elegance while also making the space feel more welcoming.

### Soft Neutrals

One of the most effective strategies is to pair black with soft neutral colors like beige, taupe, or soft gray. These colors can create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, balancing the severity of black. For instance:

- **Beige Furniture:** Consider using beige fabric sofas or chairs. They will soften the starkness of black walls or furnishings.
- **Gray Accents:** Light gray pillows or throws can add texture while keeping the focus on the black elements.
- **Wood Tones:** wooden furniture in lighter hues can provide warmth, enriching the black decor.

### Bold Jewel Tones

If you want to make a statement, jewel tones are a perfect choice. Rich hues like emerald green, sapphire blue, or ruby red can add a luxurious touch to black decor. They stand out beautifully against a black backdrop. Here are a few ways to incorporate them:

- **Accent Walls:** Paint one wall in a jewel tone while keeping the others black for a dramatic look.
- **Artwork:** Choose art pieces that incorporate these bold colors to enhance visual interest without overwhelming the space.
- **Accessories:** Use cushions or rugs in these rich colors to add pops of vibrancy to your black decor.

### Classic White

Pairing black with white is a timeless choice that is both elegant and sophisticated. The stark contrast between these colors creates a clean and crisp look:

- **Furniture:** White furniture against black walls creates a chic, modern vibe.
- **Lighting:** Use white lamps or chandeliers to brighten up black spaces and add a touch of class.
- **Accessories:** White frames for artwork or mirrors can enhance the contrast and bring attention to the pieces.

### Pops of Color

Don’t be afraid to use bright colors as accents against your black decor. Shades like yellow, pink, or turquoise can provide a playful contrast:

- **Accent Chairs:** Consider a bright chair that stands out against black furniture.
- **Throw Pillows:** Use vibrant pillows on black sofas to add energy to the room.
- **Artwork:** Bright, colorful art can create focal points in an otherwise dark space.

### Natural Elements

Integrating natural elements can soften black decor and create a more grounded environment. Consider these options:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- **Plants:** Use green plants to add life and color. The natural greens will contrast beautifully with black.
- **Textured Fabrics:** materials like jute, linen, or cotton adds depth and texture while complementing black.
- **Stone Accents:** Accessories made of natural stone can provide an organic feel that breaks up the solidness of black.

### Metallic Finishes

Another exciting way to style black decor is through the use of metallic finishes. Gold, silver, and copper can add a touch of glamour and sophistication:

- **Light Fixtures:** Metallic light fixtures create a striking contrast against black ceilings.
- **Decorative Accessories:** Incorporate vases, mirrors, or picture frames with metallic finishes to reflect light and bring energy to the space.
- **Furniture Accents:** Consider furniture with metallic legs or accents to add elegance.

Choosing the right color pairings with black decor can transform your home into a stylish and inviting space. Whether you opt for soft neutrals, bold jewel tones, classic white, bright pops of color, natural elements, or metallic finishes, each color offers unique benefits that can enhance the beauty of black decor. The key is to create a balanced look that feels cohesive while also expressing your personal style.

### Conclusion

When it comes to creating a stunning space with black decor, the right accessories play a crucial role in elevating the overall aesthetic. By incorporating items that enhance the richness of black, you can create depth and interest in your home. Metallic accents, such as gold or silver, add a touch of glamour, while natural elements like wood or greenery soften the starkness of black, making your space welcoming and comfortable.

Color pairings are another essential aspect to consider. Bright and bold hues, such as vibrant yellows or electric blues, can create a striking contrast that draws the eye and adds excitement. On the other hand, softer colors like pastels or neutral shades can create a calming backdrop that allows the black decor to stand out without overwhelming the space. Textures play a key role too; mix smooth surfaces with plush fabrics to create visual variety.

Remember, the goal is to curate a harmonious environment that reflects your personal style. Whether you're emphasizing elegance with sleek metallics or embracing a cozy vibe with warm textures, choosing the right accessories and colors can transform your black-themed space into a captivating sanctuary. Let your creativity flow and enjoy the process of bringing your unique vision to life!

My coworker (35F) and I(31M) have been working together for three years now. When she first started at the company, I was immediately drawn to her. Over the past three years, we’ve always shared awkward eye contact and seem to make eye contact regardless of the space we’re in.

Last year, I invited her to our company softball league game. She came and we chatted for a bit there. The following morning, our coworker (who works in the same department as her) approached me and said that you and she would make a great couple. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Fast forward to earlier this year. I asked her for her number through the companies user chat, and she gave it to me. I ended up texting her, but our conversation was short-lived and didn’t lead to anything significant. However, we still chatted around the office occasionally.

A few weeks ago, we ended up at the same happy hour for one of our coworkers who was leaving the company. We chatted for about 45 minutes, discussing work and personal life. Ever since that day, I’ve noticed that I’m developing feelings for her again. In recent days, she’s brought up more personal topics in our conversations, and I feel like she’s more comfortable now. Our conversations aren’t just small talk around the office anymore.

However, I’m not sure if she’s interested in me or just being friendly. I’ve been thinking about texting her, but I haven’t since I first got her number. I also found out that her birthday is in a few days. I was thinking of texting her a happy birthday or inviting her to grab lunch or coffee to celebrate before her birthday.

*His young trainee nodded, eyes widening. He had grown up in the city, where The Meteor Man was an infamous and unavoidable urban legend. The trainee had first heard the tale around a campfire when he was ten. Since then, he had heard many different versions of the story at sleepovers, high school football games, and while smoking cigarettes outside the mall.*

*The story goes that the man had thrown himself off a building, but when he arrived at the ground, it appeared like he had fallen from somewhere much higher than a building. People say it looked like he had fallen from somewhere in the outer atmosphere, as his body arrived to the street completely incinerated, even though he was never on fire.*

*A knowing grin emerged above the maintenance worker’s chin. He leaned back in his office chair, savoring the moment of anticipation before his treasured reveal.*

*“Well…I met the man. Only days before he plummeted to the street, in fact.”*

*The maintenance worker pantomimed the scene with his right hand as he talked. Index and middle finger acting as The Meteor Man, jumping off an invisible building to inevitably “splat” on the desk that seperated the two men.*

“*This is the building he fell from.” he said, pausing afterwards for effect.*

*”And he didn’t jump off the top - psycho broke through his own window, dropping thirty stories from his own apartment.”*

*The story teller took a large gulp of lukewarm coffee. He looked down at the remaining liquid, which reminded him of his favorite part of the story. The part that only him and a few other people were aware of.*

*“No one ever mentions the blackness, neither.”*

*The trainee leaned in, captivated.*

“*What do you mean…blackness?”*

*————————*

Nathan really believed he had accumulated everything.

Like a prison warden leering down from the ramparts, he watched the laypeople, his metaphorical inmates, traverse the eroding city streets through the body length window in his thirtieth-story high rise bedroom. Financial circumstance incarcerated them; he was wealthy, liberated, and free.

Through his affluence, his ungodly excess, he had severed those ties that bind. His perception of superiority was intoxicating. No dark brandy, nor sexual enterprising, nor synthetically perfected opioid could match the feeling that came with that perception. To Nathan, they did not even come close. The strongest cocaine that money could buy barely even registered as pleasurable when compared to the inebriation of perceived supremacy. The white powder was a sickly red-yellow flicker of an old match, consumed and assimilated in an instant by the roaring, draconic inferno that was his ascendance from the common man.

Alone in his newly purchased multimillion-dollar penthouse, he felt comfortable and sated. The elevation from the dregs of society made him safe, he mused. Laypeople were cannibals. Maybe not literally, but a desperate need forced them to tear each other limb from limb on a regular basis.

The physical distance was a necessary security measure for a man of his financial stature.

His life is perfect, the old man thought. Although, he still felt a little hollow. But to Nathan, that was just his killer instinct - his boundless ambition to climb one more rung up the societal ladder. If he didn’t feel a little hollow, what would drive himself to accumulate more?

He would get up every morning at seven and start his routine by moving to view the city streets from his bedroom. The window he did this from was ostentatiously large, sleek, and stainless. It was the wall that separated Nathan from the outside atmosphere, running the length of the floor and all the way up to the ceiling. From his lonely perch, he would observe the people beneath him, daydreaming that they were ants wriggling and squirming futilely beneath the shadow of his waiting foot.

Sometime later, his morning vigil would be expectantly interrupted by a call - his driver letting Nathan know that he had arrived in the garage thirty floors below him. He would take one last long look, basking in his rapturous elevation, before leaving for the day.

As he approached sea level in the elevator, Nathan routinely experienced a sort of withdrawal. He would yearn to return to his spire mere moments after leaving it. The old man hated the space between his apartment and the car because of what it revealed to him.

He felt powerful and vital when he was in his penthouse, impossibly high above the city and its people. He felt identically powerful and vital when he was masquerading as one of the partners at his law firm, which began the moment he entered the company car with his chauffeur. In the brief space between those places, however, he could feel the actual hideous truth, and it made him helpless and brittle. As that truth took hold, Nathan would experience a rush of primal nausea, followed by his palms becoming damp with sweat. It was a byproduct of the reality that he did his absolute damnedest to ignore.

The reality that he was nothing, and he had nothing.

Thankfully, navigating that existential space was less than one percent of his day. In the grand scheme of things, it was negligible and manageable. As soon as he was away from that truth, he’d push it as far back into his brainstem as it would go.

The old man would have continued like this indefinitely had the view from his high rise not been obscured by an inky black veil. An unexplainable, tenebrous curtain that fell over his window to the sounds of an an inaudible and otherworldly standing ovation from a place beyond perception, and it marked the coming end of Nathan’s brief and forgettable stage-play.

————————————

When his digital alarm sounded that fateful morning, Nathan awoke utterly disorientated. His sixteen-hundred square foot master bedroom was unexplainably sunless.

The old man widened and squinted his eyes, trying to adjust to his lightless surroundings, but to no avail. Nathan could appreciate the faint glow of the light coming from the hall that led to his kitchen in the top lefthand corner of his vision, but otherwise, the room was pitch black. He sat upright in bed, motionless, struggling to compute the change.

For obvious reasons, he never had his bedroom window shades drawn, not wanting to block his view of the serfs below. He had contemplated removing the shades entirely, but was ultimately too lazy to do it himself. Nathan began troubleshooting the possibilities - what if a storm had rolled in? It felt unlikely - even if the cityscape was enveloped by some exceedingly dense overcast, the millions of small urban lights would have provided some illumination, like a glimmering swarm of fireflies breaking through a moonless night. He considered the possibility that the city’s power grid had gone haywire, and it was still the middle of the night, despite what his alarm clock read.

But the *entire* city without power? That felt impossible.

Moreover, if everyone was without electricity, what light could he faintly appreciate coming from his kitchen? The only explanation he had left was that he was in a vivid, if not exceptionally odd, dream. So Nathan sat and impatiently waited for this dream to abate. An excruciating forty-five seconds passed without such luck. Unsure of what else to do, he blindly fumbled to locate his cell phone plugged in across the room, swearing and cursing at the almighty and the universe for these new and unfair phantasmagoric circumstances.

After some slapstick trips and falls appreciated by no one, he found his phone and activated the flashlight. Carefully, he used the makeshift lantern to guide himself out into his kitchen.

With compounding befuddlement, Nathan found his kitchen bathed in the rising sun’s light, the same as every other day. Standing at the end of the hallway that connected the two rooms, his disorientated state glued him to the wood tiling. He swiveled his head toward the void that used to be his bedroom, then back to the normal-appearing kitchen, back to the void, and so on a dozen times. This repetitive, cartoonish appraisal failed to illuminate Nathan, and was another comedic beat that, unfortunately, went unappreciated.

He decided the next best course of action was to involve the complex’s concierge in the troubleshooting. At the very least, they would serve as a punching bag to direct his confused rage toward. That day’s concierge was thoroughly desensitized to the inane tantrums of the obscenely wealthy, but this complaint surpassed petty disapproval. It was downright absurd.

Finally, there was someone to appreciate the comedy of the situation.

*“Your window is...malfunctioning, sir?”*

A maintenance worker made his way up to the thirtieth-floor high-rise. He had dropped what he was doing to attend to Nathan’s outlandish complaint but was still met with righteous indignation when he opened the door, because of the perceived delay in arrival.

No response would have been quick enough for Nathan, however. Even if the worker had teleported to his front door, the old man would still have been frustrated that the worker didn’t have the courtesy to teleport inside his condominium, saving this apparently important man valuable time by eliminating the need to answer the door.

Nathan led the worker to his bedroom and outstretched his arm, placing his hand palm-up in the darkness's direction. It was a gesture meant to imply the darkness was somehow the worker’s fault while simultaneously asking what he intended to do to fix it. The worker looked at the bedroom, then back at Mr. Suthering quizzically. Nathan petuantly doubled down on his previous gesticulation, re-performing it with more gusto and vigor, rather than wasting his words on a blue-collar man. The worker than scanned the area for signs of alcoholism, drug abuse, or mental illness. When he did not find any liquor bottles, hypodermic needles, or empty pill bottles implying that the old man had missed a refill of something important, he decided his only course of action was to inspect the “malfunctioning window”.

He made his way into the bedroom and towards the “problem”.

——————————-

*Seeing that he had the young trainee spellbound, the maintenance worker’s grin found enough real estate to somehow grow even larger.*

*He downed the rest of his coffee, winked, and then resumed.*

*“Yeah…the crotchety old coot couldn’t see the inside of his bedroom. Could see everything else just fine, though.”*

*“I could tell he was freaking out. I mean, I understand why. It made no earthly sense. If there was something physically wrong with him, all of his vision should have been affected. But it was just his bedroom. Said it was pitch-black, like the whole damn thing was enveloped by some kind of fog that only he could see.”*

*The young trainee was stunned. Awestruck, even. It was like meeting a celebrity’s cousin. Someone close enough to have inside information but still far enough removed to not know the whole story, keeping the mystique intact.*

“*I only saw him one time after that. Or rather, I heard him.”*

*“Howling like a banshee the night before he became The Meteor Man.”*

——————————-

To Nathan, it looked like the worker was swallowed whole by the miasma of his bedroom. Once again, he was dumbstruck. Nathan grabbed his phone, pointed the flashlight into the darkness of the bedroom, and cautiously entered behind the man.

The old man watched as the worker navigated the room without question or concern. He stepped over loose items of clothing on the floor and avoided stubbing his toe on the oversized bedframe that held Nathan’s king-sized bed. Nathan stood at the edge of the darkness, watching him perform these feats without the help of any auxiliary illumination. The phone flashlight he held could not penetrate entirely through the ink that filled the volume of his bedroom from where he was standing, making the worker intermittently disappear and reappear from the blackness. It was like he was spelunking deep within the earth, only to find the worker was some subterranean humanoid who had only ever known darkness, granting him the ability to attend to his duties with no need for light.

Eventually, unsure of how to proceed, the worker returned to the bedroom entrance, where Nathan stood petrified by confusion. The sight of the old man confounded and afraid of seemingly nothing, holding a phone light forward into a room that was already damn bright from the morning sun, did manage to spark some pity in him.

*“Do you need me to call you an ambulance, buddy?”*

Of course, this only re-invoked Nathan Suthering’s rage. While in the middle of an unfocused tirade, his phone vibrated, causing Nathan to throw it to the ground and jump back as if it had spontaneously metamorphosed into a tarantula. His driver was calling; he had arrived in the garage. Nathan promptly kicked the worker out of his home, trying to let wrath mask his embarrassment over the situation. He threw on a suit and tie, finding the clothes using a large flashlight he procured from a cupboard.

As he was walking out the door, he had an idea. Nathan returned to his apartment, stuffing a pair of binoculars into his briefcase before leaving for the day.

Instead of going to the garage, he went to the city sidewalk that faced his penthouse. Through his binoculars, he slowly counted floors to his apartment complex until he hit thirty.

From the outside, he could see into his apartment, recognizing his wardrobe and other furniture visible through the windows. Nathan gasped, letting the binoculars tumble to the ground.

Why could he not appreciate the darkness from the outside?

Dazed by the morning’s events, he sleepwalked into the company car, hoping this all represented a transient stroke or unexplainable optical illusion. When he arrived home that evening to find deathly blackness still oozing from his bedroom, he had to face the reality that this phenomenon was neither a stroke nor an illusion.

————————————

For the first few days, Nathan Suthering mitigated the unbridled existential terror by filling the catacomb that used to be his bedroom with various electrical light sources. Each light source, in isolation, was much too weak to cut through the haze. Nathan required an absolute military cavalcade of fluorescence to stand a chance of fully seeing his bedroom. With his lights set up and on, he tried to sleep, but it was a futile effort. After about an hour, like clockwork, the lightbulbs in his bedroom would explode no matter the source that housed them.

Unable to relax without every corner of his bedroom illuminated and constantly awakened by the tiny implosions, he laid his head on the sofa farthest from his bedroom. The entrance of the bedroom was, thankfully, still visible for monitoring from the sofa. This change in tactics afforded him a few minutes of shuteye, but only a few. He had run out of spare lightbulbs by the time he had migrated to the sofa. To Nathan’s distress, he was forced to give up on pushing back the oppressive darkness. He constantly opened his eyes to ensure the ink was not spreading, vigilant as well for signs of movement that could represent a malicious entity emerging from somewhere in that tomb. The ink did not spread, and no phantoms were ever born from the darkness.

Despite this good fortune, night after night, Nathan got less and less sleep. Although nothing appeared *out of* the darkness, something eventually manifested from *inside* of it, and it turned his blood to ice. Abruptly and unceremoniously, a noise began to emanate from his bedroom: short bursts of rhythmic tapping, the unmistakable sound of knuckles rapping on glass - the horrifically familiar reverberations of human knocking.

At first, hours passed between instances of the knocking. Nathan tried to convince himself it was just sleep deprivation playing tricks on his aching psyche. But what was at first an hour’s reprieve from the uncanny disturbance then became only minutes, and what was initially the sound of one hand knocking on glass eventually became two, then five, and then the noise was so chaotic that Nathan was unable to discern how many knocks were overlapping with each other. At wit’s end, Nathan arrived at a sort of tormented frenzy that almost could be mistaken for courage. He jumped up from the sofa and descended into his bedroom, turning on the kitchen light en route and wielding only his phone for protection.

When he entered, he could tell that the knocking was coming from directly outside his bedroom window. As he approached the window, however, the knocking slowed - stopping completely when he was a few feet from it. Directing his phone light at the glass, he could only see darkness outside the window, simultaneously framing a faint silhouette of himself reflecting off the inside surface. Nathan then stood statuesque in the black silence, unsure of how to proceed, when the bulb in his phone erupted into sparks.

In a fraction of a second, the miasma subsumed him.

The heat from the explosion burnt the palm of his right hand, pain causing him to throw the phone somewhere unseen into the mire that used to be his bedroom. Compared to before, he could no longer orient himself to his position in the bedroom by the gleam of the kitchen light - he simply could not see it.

He couldn’t see anything.

Nathan desperately tried to find the way out, but without light, the size of his bedroom had become seemingly infinite. He started by walking carefully in the direction opposite to where he thought the window was, but after a few steps, a sharp pain like a cat bite inflamed his right ankle, bringing him to his knees with a yelp.

Now crawling, he kept moving away from the window. He did not pivot to the right or left, yet he never encountered a wall or the hallway, no matter how far he went. Nathan believed he had been pulling himself forward for hours.

The carpet began to feel wet and sticky with an odorless substance. As he kept moving, the carpet seemed to transition into grass and soil. When a flare of madness overtook Nathan, he attempted to pull what he thought was grass out of the ground. Instead of the grass-like substance yielding from the soil, each piece stayed firmly tethered in place while creating multiple lacerations into the flesh of Nathan’s left palm as he dragged it upwards. The sensation was as if he had forcefully run the inside of his hand along multiple razor blades. Nathan reflexively brought his hand to his mouth, tasting metallic blood as it leaked from him.

Defeated, he curled into a ball and fell on his side, resigned to eventually starving in that position rather than facing more of the abyss.

As his head touched the floor, a familiar vibration and a dim light against his cheek startled him. He picked up his lost phone, finding it difficult to answer an incoming call because of the blood that had oozed onto the screen. Looking at his phone, tinted crimson through his murky blood, he could discern that he had missed a call from his driver and that it was eight in the morning. In abject horror, Nathan recalled looking at his phone before he foolishly entered the darkness, and it had read six forty-five AM.

He had been in his bedroom for only a little over an hour.

Utilizing the dim light of the phone screen, Nathan attempted to determine where he was and how close he had been to making it out into the hallway. Instead, the light revealed his reflection in the window, staring back at him, indicating he had not moved anywhere at all.

When he found his way out of the bedroom turned schizophrenic nightmare, he fell to the floor of the hallway and sobbed. After he had no more tears to give, Nathan numbly examined himself, looking to evaluate his injuries. There was a tiny burn on his right hand from where his phone’s exploding bulb had scorched it, but he did not see the gashes on his left palm. He did not see the blood on his phone. He felt his right ankle for evidence of the perceived cat bite, but he found only smooth, intact skin.

In a raving panic, he determined he was most likely insane from a brain tumor and needed a physician. The next step in that plan would be to go to the garage and find his driver, who would then deliver him to the hospital.

Nathan spilled out his front door, enjoying the welcome relief of his escape, though this was cut short by the resumed sound of knocking on glass. He turned his body in the doorway to face the obsidian depths of his bedroom and its incessant knocking, and then he screamed into it out of fear, exhaustion, and anger.

When he stopped, things were briefly silent, and Nathan felt a shred of pride rise in his chest, as he earnestly believed that he had managed to strike back and injure a fathomless void.

After a moment, another scream broke the quiet, exactly identical to Nathan’s, but it was not coming from him - it was coming from his bedroom, twice as loud as before.

He turned to sprint towards the elevator, but the knocking resumed with a heightened ferocity. The old man assumed that creating distance from the window, from the sound, would dampen the hellish drumming, in accordance with natural law. As he created space from the window, however, the knocking only grew more deafening in his ears. When he reached the elevator threshold, the noise was like helicopter blades thrumming inches from his head. Nathan wanted to escape, but he knew implicitly that the only time the knocking had ceased was when he was next to the window. Despite this, he pushed forward and entered the elevator, managing to press the button for the garage.

He had only reached the twenty-seventh floor when the cacophony became unbearable, like his skull was perpetually splintering into thousands of fragments from the pressure the sound created in his mind, but his brain did not have the mercy to implode alongside the pain and actually kill him. He wildly hammered the open door button and ran the three flights of stairs back up to the thirtieth floor, down the hallway, and back into his penthouse.

————————————

*“So picture this,” The maintenance worker said, suppressing a smoker’s cough as he did.*

*“I’m working on the twenty-sixth floor, minding my own business, when I determine some electrical issue is actually originating one floor below. So, I walk over to the stairwell, and when I open the door, I hear some lunatic screaming nonsense from a floor or two above.”*

“*I didn’t see the guy, so I don’t know for certain, but it sure as shit sounded like The Meteor Man.”*

*The trainee broke through his amazement long enough to ask a follow up question.*

“*Do you remember what he was screaming about?”*

*The maintenance worker contemplated the question. No one in recently memory had asked him about the contents of The Meteor Man’s ravings, so he had to dig deep to try to recall what he said.*

*“Something about an ‘Elise’. He was asking her to stop knocking, and that he was sorry.”*

*“Whatever all that means”*

————————————

All sense of self-preservation erased and overwritten by the need for the knocking to abate, Nathan Suthering rocketed headfirst into the miasma of his bedroom. Guided by the dim light of his phone screen, he located where he stood before, but the knocking did not cease this time. He moved a few steps closer, but still, the knocking did not cease. With no more space between himself and the window, he pressed his face against the glass, looking to where the street should be, and the knocking finally lifted and dissolved into the ether.

The relief, again, was short-lived.

With his eyes directed downward, he saw the sidewalk adjacent to his building, framed and isolated from the rest of the city by a familiar blackness. An enormous gathering of people gazed up singularly at Nathan, elbow to elbow and unmoving, but they were grotesquely malformed. The people below Nathan had bulbous heads sporting inhuman features.

Their eyes dominated the top of their faces, and their mouths dominated the bottom of their faces, and there was barely any visible skin to demarcate the two characteristics.

Their mouths were that of a lamprey’s, gaping and circular, asymmetric teeth littering the cavity.

Their eyes were compound and honeycombed like that of a fly or a praying mantis.

Thousands of these abominations all stared up at Nathan Suthering, waiting. Finally, a chime sounded from an unknown location, and one of their numbers was lifted above the crowd onto their shoulders. The myriad slowly turned away from Nathan and towards the chosen one, and in horrific synchrony, they descended on that chosen one and viciously severed them into innumerable fleshy pieces. The creatures close enough to the carnage greedily filled their gullets with the remains. They inserted meat into their cavernous mouths, but they would not chew. Instead, the circles of teeth would spin and rotate, flaying and deconstructing the tissue until it could slide gently into their throats.

The vision and the accompanying soundscape were mind-shattering, and Nathan drew his head back and closed his eyes. As soon as he did so, the knocking would resume at peak intensity, debilitating pressure finding home again in his skull. The pain would cause him to open his eyes and place his face against the glass to once again bear witness to whatever infernal rite was occurring on the ground below. The horrors would gaze up at him, patiently awaiting another chime to sound and signal sacrifice. When it did, he would watch the bloodletting until he could no longer, and then the knocking would find purchase in him again.

This surreal cycle continued, with no signs of relenting, until a divine visage pressed its hand against the glass of Nathan’s window from the outside.

Amidst the hallucinogenic maelstrom, it took Nathan a few moments to recognize his ex-wife. Elise was somehow floating in the ether outside, curly brown locks swaying gingerly like wisps of air and a familiar set of green eyes meeting his.

The couple had met in law school when Nathan’s psychopathy was in its infancy. Initially, Elise had pulled him back from the brink, from the point where he would need to divest his identity as collateral for the chance at wealth and power. A year after meeting each other, they were wed, and there were talks of starting a family.

In a pivotal moment, however, Nathan internalized what starting a family would mean for him - children meant hospital bills, exponential living costs, and college tuitions. It wouldn’t bankrupt him, not by a long shot, but it would lead to his devolution into one of the people on the sidewalk. As a common man, he would be constantly looked down upon from a high rise by some other devil.

Nathan realized he could not and would not tolerate that judgment.

Out of the blue, and with Elise two months pregnant, Nathan filed for divorce. Having divested his soul, no amount of pleading, reasoning, or suffering would ever return him to humanity. To his dying day, he had no idea what had become of his wife or his child.

Although the old man would never know the truth, it was this: Elise had lived a long and difficult life. She raised a beautiful, hard working daughter. But it had not been easy, and she had grown to resent her ex-husband with a white-hot, feverish intensity. 

Days before he became The Meteor Man, and minutes before the black mist arrived in Nathan's room, Elise passed away after a long fight with stomach cancer.

In times of true duress, Nathan would still think of his ex-wife fondly, but only because the thought of her seemed to comfort and sedate him, not because he earnestly missed her.

Elise reached out to him with her hand as if to say she had heard his agony and had come to deliver him salvation. Her fingertips touched the window’s glass from the outside, and Nathan tried to phase his hand through the barrier to accept her offer. Elise watched him struggling, pushing his hands on different areas of the window as if there was some invisible hole in the wall between them, and he only needed to locate it to survive.

Eventually, Elise showed mercy. She slid her right hand through the window effortlessly and placed it lovingly on Nathan’s cheek.

For a third and final time, his relief was short-lived.

She snapped her hand from his cheek to the back of his head, grabbed a thick and sturdy tuft of hair, and drove his head into the window from the opposite side, partially caving in the front of his skull and splintering the window with two sickening twin cracks. She paused and then drove his head into the window again. And a third time. And in a grand finale, she shattered the window and pulled him through, held him by the back of the head so he could view the people and the city street from above one last time, and then she dropped him into the waiting maw below.

————————————

*“Did you get to see the crime scene?” The young trainee asked.*

*“No, I didn’t. I don’t go up to the thirtieth floor much, either. Not if I don’t have to.”*

*The story teller’s mood had shifted from playful to somber. He looked away from the trainee as he wrapped up his part in the tale.*

“*I don’t know who Elise is, but sometimes I see the frame of a woman. Featureless, black mist roaming the halls on the thirtieth floor.”*

“*Whatever The Meteor Man had in life, it’s hers now in death.”*

*And with that, he concluded the story. At least as he understood it.*

————————————

After Nathan had landed on the sidewalk, he was reduced to pulp and bone for all the passersby to see. A final humiliation, to have it revealed in an outrageous spectacle that he was no god, that he was flesh just like everyone else.

When the police entered his thirtieth-story high-rise, they found no darkness within. All they saw was a broken window, a hammer in his bedroom that had been used to shatter the glass, and the spot where Nathan Suthering threw himself onto the asphalt below. The one nagging feature the police could not explain, however, was the state of the body on its arrival to earth. The old man’s flesh had been seared and charcoaled almost beyond recognition. Yet, there was no sign of a fire in his apartment, nor on the city street that he fell onto.

This phenomenon was never scientifically explained, and the old man had no one willing to posthumously investigate the mystery for him.

After his curtain call, Nathan did manage to retain a minor thread of infamy. Not as a demigod of wealth and power, but instead as the legend of “The Meteor Man” - a nameless individual who seemingly plummeted to earth from an impossible height in the outer atmosphere, incinerating any and all trace of who he once was.

Seeking thoughts towards the end. I’ll lay out my story for those interested. I’ve read some great ones that left me thankful for the experiences and trials shared. I hope to share positivity and insight too. 

**The Story**

It started in 2020. I moved into a family place that had no one living in it for years. I was sorting through some mental issues and recurring chronic pain at the time and this was going to be a space for me to heal. It was musty, smelled of mildew. I mentioned it once in passing to a neighbor. She said, very seriously, “Mold should not be taken lightly.“ There was nothing visible. I shrugged it off. This was South Florida. 

A few weeks into living there, I started having strange rashes. They were very light pinkish dots. They matched nothing I could find online. Covid, maybe? I thought. Mold, I now know. 

Other symptoms cropped up. I was tired, all day. I never had enough energy. I would fall asleep sitting up. I felt insanely bloated. Looking back now, at my face, I wonder how I didn’t see it. Water retention was real. I felt like I lumbered everywhere, like my joints were leaden. I would schlep to the bathroom to pee multiple times a night and so much during the day, too. I was tired, and yet — I could not get a decent night sleep. I never felt rested. My hair started thinning. More and more of it came out during showers. I started having hormone imbalances and severe acne. And over the course of the three years, my cognition severely declined and digestion was impacted. Near the end of it, I could hardly eat — anything? (even some fruits/nuts/veg!) without it causing me digestive issues. I was in my early twenties with the gripes of an old person.

During the first year I left for a month to visit a friend in Colorado. I felt better. I fancied it was the social aspect of hanging out with a friend. When I returned to the environment I lived in I started feeling fatigued. I thought, I can’t dislike the city *this* much. This is when suspicion for an environmental toxin began.

I had seen literal mold growth on clothing before and it didn’t click until then. What, an invisible thing affecting my health? My symptoms matched what others had experienced with mold. I found a good mold remediation company who came out and said it was in the air and AC, circulating. South Florida is so freaking humid that it’s always above the recommended level of humidity and if you don’t run a dehumidifier 24/7 the moisture from outside will enter. This is what contributed to have mold “grow” in the air even though there was nothing visible. Outdoor mold had gotten inside and the high humidity and with no one inhabiting the place or running the AC made the air into a mold soup. The company cleaned the air ducts and gassed the whole place with a type of low-level bleach/chlorine dioxide substance and I left for an evening. I came back and it was a night and day difference. I was able to breathe and sleep. Bloating went down. I slowly felt like I had energy again. 

This was not yet the worst of it. 

Unknown to me, the lip of the bathtub was leaking into a unit at the end of the tub and that unit lined a drywall wall that fed into the closet. I found the mold two and a half years into my living there because it had grown on a bag that was on a shelf. This was a built-in unit on the other side of the drywall. I thought, ah, maybe a problem to look into, and mentioned it to the family who owned the place, with some urgency as this had affected me before. 

You think I would have learned. Mold had more to teach me. 

**The Second Round — Eye Problem Begins**

I did not press the issue until an eye problem started. I went to see a doctor because I had what I called a ‘vision imbalance’ — my right eye once didn’t adjust to outside light when I came out of a darker stairwell. I thought, odd. I thought, let me be responsible and google this. I then saw that it may be necessary to consult a doctor and thought, let me be responsible and go get this checked by an eye doctor. I was expecting them to find nothing. They told me I had uveitis — eye inflammation. With more tests, they found a blood vessel leaking at the back of my right eye. A few months later, the pain started. Like a charlie horse at the back of the eye. I had floaters across my vision. The pain would make me double over and press my hands to my eyes. Steroid eyedrops for inflammation did not help. Bloodwork was done to rule out diseases. These were some of the best eye doctors in the nation and they could not figure it out. I then thought *ah, mold.* 

A company came out and removed the entire unit where I had seen some growth on the shelf and the back of it and the wall were *covered in mold.* It was black and formed in ringed patterns. 

During this time I was also exhibiting depression symptoms, even thought I desired to do things and generally enjoyed my life. In-between mold-related problems I had dredged my mind for answers to mental health and uncovered interests I wanted to pursue. In the years I had also found practitioners who took my (prior to mold) chronic pain seriously (hypermobility with athletic injuries that had healed poorly and bound up fascia, a whole other story :)) During this second hit of mold, I felt I could not get anything done during a day. I knew I had ADHD but this was just madness. It was like I was a snail racing through the day, trying so hard to get from one task to another. Then the finish line would rise up to meet me and it was nighttime and I thought — how did I do nothing today? I was without social media, hardly on technology, but also not doing things I enjoyed. I simply had no idea where my time went and why it seemed to stretch out so long, so slow, everything so hard to do, then snap like rubber and another day was over. I began to question how anyone did anything. I couldn’t put thoughts together. My mind was hazy, foggy. How did I ever do things before? A therapist I had started seeing said I was doing really well for my age then a few weeks later suggested depression and I resisted this wholeheartedly because I *wanted* to do things and just…couldn’t.

So — found this second round of mold. Physical growth on a wall this time. Got it removed. And my eye pain *went away.* I brought this Good News to the eye doctors and told them of found mold and removed mold and stopped pain and they checked my eyes and saw there was no more inflammation. The main doctor looked at me with a distance in her eyes and said “this is not the first time I’ve heard this but this is not in the textbooks.” Next appointment they had “mold girl” written on my paper. 

I was given superpowers. As a preemptory signal, my eye hurts when I’m in a building with mold. My lungs also feel irritated in certain circumstances. With these newfound powers I tested public buildings, coffee shops, libraries, even a bookstore where I worked. In South Florida, they all had some issue with mold growth. I knew I had to get out of the apartment I lived in for long-term healing (car also had hella mold) but beyond that, the whole city too. Not too sad for me, I didn’t love it. I hedged a personal bet that New York City would have less mold than south Florida. It did, but not quite….

Mold was back at its podium again. 

The apartment in New York had, no, yes, you guessed it — mold. I was looking forward to healing and one month in, found I had increased food intolerances, increased fatigue, increased urination, and then came the hammer: eye pain. I started seeing flashes of light across my vision. I might not lose my life like I’ve read some people have in very extreme cases but I knew losing my vision was not out of possibility. I scoured the apartment and found it growing in my roommate’s room. Water had leaked into the upper windowsill for what looked like a long time and grew mold on the sheetrock, where paint had tried to be plastered over it and the nice clean shiny gloss of it was peeling off the wet and oozing mold-ridden area. It was so little in comparison to the wall in south Florida but when you’re sensitive, you’re sensitive. We lived on the top floor and the roof was poorly patched and I figured there was probably more I couldn’t even see, even if this visible spot were remediated. I cut my losses and moved out.

This is when I addressed the mold in my body properly with a functional doctor. Got mold tests done and gut tests for sensitivities. Started supplements and thought, yeah okay, we’ll see about this. WOW. WOWW. Numerous benefits. That was only when I really started to heal. It helped so much, and the fog lifted at first a little, then more and more often, and I was able to look back and see how bad it all was. The last lesson mold wanted me understand: seek to heal in full. 

With my superpower eyes and lungs I “tested” some other NYC apartments during tours, looking for water damage and stuff coating the AC if a unit had one. None were found viable, and as I could not afford to be picky nor test each apartment I wanted, I left the city, and have been on an adventure ever since. 

**Mold as a Blessing** 

My displacement led me to some unique experiences. I got to work on a sailboat, on a farm in the desert, at a castle in Austria. (No mold problems at the castle and none at other places I visited while abroad, Vienna and Barcelona, which points to theories on poor construction materials in USA that give mold such an easy time to grow.) Programs like WWOOF and Workaway allowed this to be possible. You get to live somewhere, learn something, meet cool people, and have meals provided. I got to understand different ways of living and further health information, meeting my first fellow mold-riddled person in the southwest desert. He gave me some good healing tips as he was a year into his healing journey.

I found the southwest to be a viable option and will be returning there. 

It is certainly a sore disappointment to have cognition return only to see how much was lost. Yet, it’s a blessing too. Had I not had this exposure, I would have possibly looped and knotted myself up more in my mind, that poor prior mental state of being, internalizing everything, instead of living out solutions. With recovery, I have seen progress in brain function. I push into the zones that are not as they used to be and know that each repetition is a block for the next one. 

It’s narrowed my living options (in this country, at least) but broadened my network of knowing talented and unique individuals. 

It was not easy and hard at times to advocate for myself but I found many people were understanding if they were open-minded.  

**Things That Helped**

\* cutting foods that trigger indigestion (nuts are a big one, they often have slight molds growing on them by nature of the food and are best to avoid at first)

\* eating organic, non-gmo (lots of pesticides and chemicals on foods and alterations to their molecular structure do not fare well with even a non-mold-ridden-body)

\* getting sunlight! being outdoors! getting exercise! gearing my life around physical body movement and healthy foods has been an ongoing game-changer

\*a binder, of some sort, that helps body detox from mold — recommended to me was Citrus Pectin which binds toxins as well as heavy metals

\*NAC! supplement that passes through the blood-brain barrier and helps with healing. Precursor to Glutathione, another supplement I took. Double whammy together.

\*sauna/hot room exercises recommended to me, to help body detox through sweat

**Seeking Recommendations, Your Experience**

Some of the furniture ended up back at my childhood home and the mattress, oh the mattress, rest in peace to me, was put in my very bedroom! I’ve been back for the holidays and I have eye pain when I‘m by it and feel my sleep affected. I got it removed from my room today but to what level it and other items have contaminated this home, I do not know. It’s latex with a plush, un-removable covering. Do mycotoxins diminish in objects after years in a non-moldy environment, providing it is not affecting health?

I‘d left all my stuff in a storage unit while I traveled and healed and moved it all back to my childhood home recently. I know books are porous but it is so hard to part with them. Has anyone had success, putting them in the sun or otherwise? Or, just not being as sensitive as time goes on?

Heard HBOT has helped people. Would be curious to know it anyone has done it. It is very expensive but if it has helped with recovery, maybe it would be worth looking into. 

Anyone had cognition issues and successes in bettering it?

Please, tell your shared experiences, your successes, what worked for you. Recommendations for healing. Further questions about what I did to start my healing and where I’m headed. I’ve met only a few people who have mold illness and desire to know more and feel connected in shared experience and journey towards health.

Here's what my holiday was like:

Nearly three weeks ago he got a tree and surprised me with it when I got home from work. At that point, I had done most of my shopping and was waiting for stuff to arrive.  He had gotten about half his list ordered,  and we collaborated on a few gifts,  but I'm a poor communicator,  and some people ended up with two things. 

Regardless, he put both our names on everything he bought,  in case I forgot anyone,  which I did.  

A week to go till Christmas,  he reminds me to text my mom for the holiday schedule.  I selfishly put it in the group chat so he and my mom can strategize the days, which they do without my help for the most part.  

Three days to go,  he helps me with a huge work thing,  and when I come home he has bought wrapping paper,  and we wrap gifts together- although he doesn't wrap mine so they're not spoiled for me [I wrapped his in the dead of night several weeks ago]. 

Christmas eve eve he watches a silly movie marathon with me and then before bed he runs through the schedule and we exchange one gift at midnight.  His makes me cry, he's so thoughtful. 

Christmas eve he gets back from mass with his family and drives me to my aunt's for dinner.  Christmas morning he makes coffee, we open the gifts we got each other,  and he takes me to my other aunt's for appetizers,  then he goes to his family dinner and texts me when they are sitting down to dessert.  Also he sends pictures of his family opening the gifts we got them so I don't miss it.  My mom drops me at his grandma's for dessert,  and then he takes me home early so we can FaceTime my dad.  

Every step of the way,  he is aware of what stresses me out and strategizes to avoid it.  I try to do the same,  but stuff doesn't really stress him out.  

I do think that's the key thing,  though.  He wants me to have a good holiday,  and he does everything in his power to ensure that happens. 


Happy holidays,  and may Santa bring you all a partner like mine

In 2022 I found myself in $4k of CC debt (started with medical bills I was dumb enough to put on a card, then Christmas gifts, then spiraled from there), so I completed a 0% balance transfer which only covered about 2/3 of my total debts. I didn’t stop spending on my cards for very long after that, and I didn’t pay off the 0% card in time to take full advantage of the zero interest. The total CC debt stayed around $4k with my spending habits despite paying more than the minimums every month.

So then in 2023 I decided to refinance my car and expand it to add in the $4k in CC debt. I thought that would take care of it, but here I am now in $6k of CC debt a year later. The worst part is that my money was spent on little dumb things like groceries, coffee, and work lunches, with frivolous spending on clothes/personal items very infrequently. Like, wtf?

I truly feel like I have had a wake up call that is different than the last two. I told my partner about these debts for the first time (it didn’t go over well), to add some more accountability and to finally get it off my chest as it was really keeping me so ashamed. I have made a habit to look at my bank account every single day, which is big for me as I avoided it out of anxiety. I froze all my credit cards, cut up the physical cards (all except the Apple Card because it’s made of metal - how do I destroy this thing?!), I have a detailed budget for the first time in my life, and I’m excited to pay off this debt with nothing but my hard work and income - not utilizing another get-out-of-jail-free card like the 0% or the refi. 

All of this does signal some real change in me, but I’m still so afraid that this spending behavior will happen again. I’m not sure yet of my spending triggers, if it’s emotional spending or just because I was too dumb/dissociated to budget until now. I didn’t have this fear the last two times I bailed myself out, so maybe that’s a good sign? Any encouragement or helpful advice is great. TIA!",3,1735270560.0,shoppingaddiction,1,1.0,False

I ran into an old friend from high school at a coffee shop, and we started catching up. She told me about her struggle to find a doctor or specialist who would accept her insurance.

She’s disabled and relies on Medicaid for her healthcare. Her condition requires frequent check-ups and treatments, but every local provider she’s contacted has either told her they’re not accepting new patients with Medicaid or doesn’t take it at all. She’s been forced to look for care hours away, which is a logistical nightmare because she can’t drive due to her condition.

She mentioned that even for providers that technically accept Medicaid, they limit how many Medicaid patients they’ll see in a given time, and the waiting lists are ridiculous. She’s been skipping appointments because she physically can’t get to them, which is only making her condition worse.

This situation just seems so wrong. Isn’t the point of Medicaid to make healthcare accessible for people who otherwise couldn’t afford it? I know reimbursement rates are lower, but shouldn’t there be some sort of obligation for providers to accept it?

Even getting on someone else's insurance wouldn't fix this apparently, as Medicare will always be her primary insurance.

It’s heartbreaking that those who need care most are left without options. This system makes no sense.",22,1735270136.0,NoStupidQuestions,38,0.85,False

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/s/hltWhypLi4

TL;DR: Went out with the boy, it was totally awkward at first but now we’re dating!

Hello guys! I’m so sorry it took so long to update this! I promise I didn’t mean to ghost you guys it was just a lot the last three weeks.

So I’m so glad people resonate with my story and gave me a lot of helpful tips, I had way more self esteem before going into the date!

I picked out an outfit and went on my way with way to little to sleep but that’s okay, I hated my outfit but I thought I would wear something that might attract him.

When I came to the coffee store he was already sitting inside, he looked at me with a smile and we hugged each other, he complimented my outfit but I just stared.

He looked extremely good, I love his curly hair he looked like a greet god guys I promise you all my positive energy vanished in that moment.

We talked a bit but I was completely nervous, I was sweating a bit and fumbled over my words. We were talking about his hobby’s and mine a good conversation but he was carrying it on his back.

After an hour or so he looked me in my eyes and said if I even wanted to be here, and I was confused at this question, he followed it up with saying that he sees how nervous I was and that he didn’t think the outfit I had on was me rather a front I was putting up.

I extremely awkwardly told him that I was very nervous and that I thought it would look nice on me, he said it did quickly before I continued that I never thought he would say yes because he is so handsome, basically pushing his ego a lot.

After I was finished he grinned and asked me what my ideal date was, I told him that I would’ve liked to play switch or something rather than sitting in a cafe, but that I had no trouble with being here.

He said okay and we continued the conversation a bit before he stood up and went to the toilet, I felt like crying in that moment, I thought I totally blew it.

When he came back he smiled and grabbed his things. ""Let’s go play switch?"" He said smiling at me, I was completely in shock. 

He paid for our coffees and we went to my house to play switch. We played for 4-5 hours and I got to know him really well. 

Guys I can’t believe that I’m typing this but this amazing and handsome boy is laying next to me right now as I’m typing this, we’ve been dating since then and I want to ask him to be my boyfriend on new years.

He’s funny, he’s good looking and honestly I don’t know how I got him, he made me feel so welcome and so seen, I’m just in awe.

But he also said that I needed to stop it with hyping him up so much as that could be potentially damaging for our relationship, I don’t really know what he means by that I’m just so in love.

Thank you for all the blessings! Hopefully I’ve got myself a boyfriend soon!

After an hour or so he looked me in my eyes and said if I even wanted to be here, and I was confused at this question, he followed it up with saying that he sees how nervous I was and that he didn’t think the outfit I had on was me rather a front I was putting up.

I extremely awkwardly told him that I was very nervous and that I thought it would look nice on me, he said it did quickly before I continued that I never thought he would say yes because he is so handsome, basically pushing his ego a lot.

After I was finished he grinned and asked me what my ideal date was, I told him that I would’ve liked to play switch or something rather than sitting in a cafe, but that I had no trouble with being here.

He said okay and we continued the conversation a bit before he stood up and went to the toilet, I felt like crying in that moment, I thought I totally blew it.

When he came back he smiled and grabbed his things. ""Let’s go play switch?"" He said smiling at me, I was completely in shock. 

He paid for our coffees and we went to my house to play switch. We played for 4-5 hours and I got to know him really well. 

Guys I can’t believe that I’m typing this but this amazing and handsome boy is laying next to me right now as I’m typing this, we’ve been dating since then and I want to ask him to be my boyfriend on new years.

He’s funny, he’s good looking and honestly I don’t know how I got him, he made me feel so welcome and so seen, I’m just in awe.

But he also said that I needed to stop it with hyping him up so much as that could be potentially damaging for our relationship, I don’t really know what he means by that I’m just so in love.

Thank you for all the blessings! Hopefully I’ve got myself a boyfriend soon! ",6,1735269672.0,AskGaybrosOver30,6,0.71,False

So I’ll get right into it: my friend just graduated from medical school this month and got assigned to a hospital also this month. She wasn’t allowed to rest at all, like she only got to celebrate Christmas. Which I know is a common (doesn’t mean okay) occurrence in the medical field. Today she began her journey as an intern and her schedule is just so chaotic: she wakes up really early and she gets home really late. 
I talked to her and she feels overwhelmed: she feels like it’s all happening so fast, and that she wasn’t given any time to adjust to this massive shift of being a medical student to a medical intern.

I don’t know what to do or how to help. She told me that there’s nothing I can do and that she’ll talk to her therapist, but I’m still worried about her. I don’t even know. What if I wing by tomorrow with coffee? Or food? Is that even a thing? She wouldn’t give me any details about her day because of how drained she’s feeling.

1hn5mb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateDayFasting/comments/1hn5mb9/thoughts_so_far/,Thoughts so far,"I wrote the other day explaining I just started ADF. I’m about a week in and I just completed another fasting day today following the modified fasting schedule (eating 15-25% of my daily needs). I have about 35-40 pounds to lose. I thought this post might be helpful for other beginners because I was doing a lot of reading/reddit scrolling to figure out what might work.  Due to Christmas I fasted Monday and today (Thursday) and I’ll be fasting Saturday. 

I am 10 pounds down so far in my weight loss journey. I started at 188 pounds and I currently weigh 177 pounds accounting for fluctuations. I’m a short person so my maintenance at my current weight is around 1750 calories.  I started the weight loss with CICO and walking a minimum of 5k steps per day even on my rest days.  I have walked every day for 45 days straight and I usually have a lot of trouble with consistency. I really believe the walking has been the key to developing consistency in other areas for me. The other key for me has been going slow and forgiving myself for slip ups. For example first I started walking and then I started CICO and then I started ADF. I didn’t try to make drastic changes quickly. 

I started my fasting days with a coffee and half and half and a fairlife protein shake between 11 am - noon. Then I try to push through until dinner when I have a small meal.  For example today I had my coffee and my protein shake mixed with a second coffee , then I had a small amount of edamame , then for dinner I had Hokkaido scallops and carrots. While that sounds substantial it comes out to 600 calories. I was also still able to walk 8k steps. I also am drinking a lot more water and tea on fasting days. 

On Christmas I ate everything I wanted to eat and still ended up in a deficit due to my fast days. I’m planning to try to prioritize protein tomorrow and just see how my body feels!  Good luck and if anyone wants a buddy I’m around. ",4,1735269506.0,AlternateDayFasting,1,1.0,False

I'm only looking for a small < 1000 sqft condo, nothing spectacular. I've checked Zillow and there's plenty of decent-looking properties throughout Florida for under 220k. I'm just not sure which areas that have those properties are going to be the nicest.  

Anyone know of good towns in Florida to buy affordable condos/apts/townhomes based on this criteria?

- Must have a decent inventory of reasonably-well-built condos, apartments or townhomes priced below $220k.
- It should be close to the coast. We want to be able to see water sometimes or go to the beach. Being directly on the water isn't strictly necessary, but being within 15-20 minutes of the coast would be preferred. 
- Must be a safe place with low crime. 
- Must have nice amenities like coffee shops, restaurants, gyms, and healthy/organic grocery stores.
- It would be a bonus if the apartment or condo was located in a walkable area that had a lot of amenities.
- It should not be an area that’s extremely crowded or has very high traffic. It would be nice for it to be a more laid back and easier place (basically I don't want a big city or tons of traffic, but I also dont want it to be extremely sleepy or boring)
- Night life doesn't matter. We're married and in our late 30s, with no kids. 
- Ideally, it’s not totally dominated by people aged 65+. It would be nice to have people in their 30s and 40s to hang out with.

Hopefully you guys can give me an idea of what areas tick those boxes pretty well. We're probably going to go down and look at places next month. ",0,1735269486.0,florida,13,0.27,False
1hn5ly5,https://www.reddit.com/r/carvana/comments/1hn5ly5/mixed_experience_selling_to_carvana/,Mixed experience selling to Carvana,"

Hello guys. So today Carvana finally picked up my truck. 

 I actually bought a car from carvana back in 2019, and had an absolutely terrible experience and have made a point of telling everyone I can to not do business with them when it comes to buying their cars. This time around I figured I would sell to them, as I needed to get rid of my truck and they made the best offer. 

So after the car Carvana sold me turned out to be a lemon, I finally ended up getting rid of it and buying a truck brand new back in 2022. Life has changed a lot since then, and my rent doubling, and cost of everything else going up so much, I decided the car payment life just couldn't work for me anymore at this time. I tried to sell my truck to another dealer, and after that deal fell through, I switched to try Carvana one last time. 

So they made me my offer, which was ""decent"". Enough for me to be able to wash my hands of the thing and not much more on top, but that's exactly what I wanted so that's fine. I scheduled the appointment for them to come and pick it up. They give you a time window, like the cable company, that they will be there. Of course that window was completely missed and he showed up an hour late. Whatever, I can deal. They rejected the truck at first because it had a chip in the windshield that I had never actually noticed before. That was frustrating due to the time wasted, but understandable. The gentleman that showed up was AMAZING. Very very friendly, and very apologitic. Can't hate on someone just doing their job. I filled his coffee thermos for him and sent him on his way and he submitted the truck for a ""manual appraisal"" which he said takes about 5 days. Unfortunately that 5 day wait was much more like 15 days. Which sucked due to the tags on the vehicle already had been transferred, so I had a truck with no plates in the parking lot for two weeks. Miracle it didn't get towed lol. 

Anyway, my manual appraisal went through, they dropped my offer by $200. Whatever that's fine, I'd rather that than go to replace the windshield anyway even if insurance would have paid for it. I scheduled for today for pickup. Was given a window for 9-11am. That worked. The guy didn't even call me to say he was leaving until almost noon, and didn't even show up until 230. That felt extremely not okay with me. It's like, time and time again this company has showed me that they have ZERO respect for my time in any way. Its the day after Christmas, if I had known that he wasn't coming until 230, I would have stayed much later with my family yesterday before driving 100 miles home, to be here nice and early for the carvana guy. 

He approved the truck, wrote me a check, and took off. Obviously I can't fault him for bad management of his dispatching. He was also a great guy. 

I will update if there is any delay in them actually sending the payoff to my bank for the truck. 

Tldr; Carvana bought my financed truck, it took longer than expected but they had the best offer and everyone I worked with was great. Much better experience than buying from carvana, but still they showed me again that they have zero respect for customers time, which I find odd when their whole shtick is that they are supposed to save you time when buying or selling a car.

1hn5ldx,https://www.reddit.com/r/debtfree/comments/1hn5ldx/how_do_you_know_you_wont_fall_into_your_old/,How do you know you won’t fall into your old spending habits?,"This month, I realized how deep I got myself into debt, and recognized I have a pattern of behavior that I’m afraid I could continue. 

In 2022 I found myself in $4k of CC debt (started with medical bills I was dumb enough to put on a card, then Christmas gifts, then spiraled from there), so I completed a 0% balance transfer which only covered about 2/3 of my total debts. I didn’t stop spending on my cards for very long after that, and I didn’t pay off the 0% card in time to take full advantage of the zero interest. The total CC debt stayed around $4k with my spending habits despite paying more than the minimums every month.

So then in 2023 I decided to refinance my car and expand it to add in the $4k in CC debt. I thought that would take care of it, but here I am now in $6k of CC debt a year later. The worst part is that my money was spent on little dumb things like groceries, coffee, and work lunches, with frivolous spending on clothes/personal items very infrequently. Like, wtf?

I truly feel like I have had a wake up call that is different than the last two. I told my partner about these debts for the first time (it didn’t go over well), to add some more accountability and to finally get it off my chest as it was really keeping me so ashamed. I have made a habit to look at my bank account every single day, which is big for me as I avoided it out of anxiety. I froze all my credit cards, cut up the physical cards (all except the Apple Card because it’s made of metal - how do I destroy this thing?!), I have a detailed budget for the first time in my life, and I’m excited to pay off this debt with nothing but my hard work and income - not utilizing another get-out-of-jail-free card like the 0% or the refi. 

All of this does signal some real change in me, but I’m still so afraid that this spending behavior will happen again. I’m not sure yet of my spending triggers, if it’s emotional spending or just because I was too dumb/dissociated to budget until now. I didn’t have this fear the last two times I bailed myself out, so maybe that’s a good sign? Any encouragement or helpful advice is great. TIA!",4,1735269421.0,debtfree,1,1.0,False

This post also contains a TRIGGER WARNING as this does contain topics of drug abuse and S/A. Im gonna try to keep this post as short and easy to follow as possible but I’m ngl there’s a lot to unpack here and I really need some help. So I (21 female Amanda) have this guy friend (22 male Patrick). We’ve been friends for almost 5 years and I consider him a member of my chosen family, because most of us in my friend group have had a pretty rough upbringing. He’s super kind, funny and generous and childhood friends with a lot of our other friend group members, which is a big reason why I still keep him around after everything, which I am now regretting. I met Patrick through my ex boyfriend of two years who is also his cousin. We met in my junior year of high-school and we all used to party and use drugs and alcohol excessively for about as long as my ex and I were together, but I’ve been sober for two years now and so have other members of our friend group and I couldn’t be more proud of us for getting out of that life, but Patrick isn’t on the same page as the rest of us and has a huge coke problem. He comes over to my best friend and I’s house unannounced and high at that. About a year ago he even tried busting lines on our coffee table and we had to tell him to stop because our younger siblings come over and eat on that table and that it wasn’t aloud in our home. So then he sneakily put it in a nasal spray so we wouldn’t notice but we are all addicts so he should have known we’d catch on to his tricks. What worries me the most is he’s going to school to be a welder and operating welding equipment around other students while he is high (he has outright bragged about it) and I’m not only worried for his safety but his classmates who are operating equipment not even a foot away from him. What if something happens and he’s not able to respond accordingly because he was too high to do so? What if he accidentally kills someone? I’m not sure exactly how much he goes through in a day but my best friends boyfriend is making it sound like he’s going through over an ounce of coke a day, which is a ton of coke for one person to do. Now I’m not sure if it’s because of the coke or if it’s because he just doesn’t think before he acts but ever since his cousin and I broke up he’s been making it very obvious he wants to be more than just friends. He’s made very inappropriate comments about my body comparing me to a “Disney mom” and has even pinched my love handles and waist playfully even while I was seeing someone when wearing a swimsuit one time. I told him strait up not to touch me like that or at all and to not make those kinds of comments about my body as it makes me extremely uncomfortable, and that if he can’t help himself then we cannot be friends anymore. He just said “okay I’ll stop”. He never apologized and I should have saw that as a sign to run immediately but I stupidly wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. He did stop for a little bit but started again when my last boyfriend and I broke up. Ig I was fair game his mind again which meant he has to try a new tactic to get out of the friend zone…Bribing. He came over one day unannounced as usual bragging about his brand new Christmas onesie and told my best friend and her boyfriend and I that we should all get matching ones and go take some pictures one of these days, and I agreed that would be a fun idea. A few days later he sends me pics of similar onesies telling me to choose one. I asked him if he was getting them for anyone else and he just responded with “I can” so I chose this really cute white green and red plaid one, assuming everyone would have matching onesies for Christmas. He comes in about a week later UNANNOUNCED with giant package just for me and my best friend and her boyfriend assumed it was for them because how could that giant box just be for one person? Mind you I’m taking a bath and he yells outside my bathroom door “OH AMANDA I GOT YOU SOMETHING!!!” I just snapped at him that I’d be down there in a bit, because hello I’m fucking naked and tryna have a nice bath in peace. When I came down he told me to open the box and I just told him I’d open it when my roommates get theirs and he left me alone. A week goes by and he shows up unannounced AGAIN wearing his onesie with my roommates Christmas presents so I opened mine from him with my roommates. Inside were two queen size blankets I’ve been saying I’ve been wanting and the Christmas onesie I picked out…he got my roommates each a graphic T (zero onesies). I told him thank you but he didn’t have to get me so much stuff the onesie have been fine. I should have asked him right then and there where my roommates onesies were but I was too distracted by him telling me to go try it on. when he said that I just got this huge pit in my stomach because I know all the weird shit that he would be thinking if I were to put it on in front of him. I told him I’ll save it for Christmas Eve and he left me alone. I ended up wearing it earlier than that to some Christmas lights where my girlfriends and I took some cute pictures for the gram, and my suspicions were confirmed when Patrick comments below my post saying, “that onesie looks so good on you”. I just deleted the comment and haven’t really acknowledged him since. It’s getting to the point we’re don’t feel safe to come out of my room anymore and my best friends boyfriend just lets him in whenever he just shows up. I don’t know what to do. I care about him as a friend and I don’t want to reject him and then push him deeper and deeper into his addiction but at the same time I shouldn’t have to hide in my own house every time he comes over. I know no matter what my best friends boyfriend isn’t going to stop being friends with him and I would never ask him to do that but how do I tell him I don’t want Patrick over here anymore, and how do I tell Patrick I don’t want him in my life anymore without pushing him deeper into his addiction?

1hn5jbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1hn5jbi/i_got_it_for_you_anyway/,I got it for you anyway…,"So this year my JNMIL got me coffee and tea as a Christmas gift. Nice right? 

Except as I open it she says “(Dear Husband) told me you don’t drink coffee, so I got you coffee and tea”.

In previous years she has:

• Text me a picture of a salad spinner prior to Xmas asking if I would use it, I politely declined and Christmas rolled around and that’s what she got me.

• Got me a wooden dish drying rack that I wanted but when I opened it said “I don’t think this is a very nice gift.”

• Claimed my present got lost in the mail. But only told DH, (who told me). But she never reached out to me about it or anything. Not that she has to replace it but it would be nice to reach out yourself to the intended gift receiver. I’m not convinced it was ever sent in the mail.

• Also a few years ago (when we first got married) she was upset that my parents got her a Christmas gift because then she had to get them one.

Am I the only one who finds all of this quite tacky? 

Oh and also gift giving is her “love language”. She got each of my kids 10-15 gifts…. They are 2.5 years and 4 months old…. This happens at baby showers and Easter etc.

At my oldest’s baby shower, she gave us no short of 32 outfits plus other things. I mean that’s so generous but I can tell that she just wants to look good in front of other people. She honestly looked a little crazy.

Then she complains not to have money and that she can’t get things for herself because she lives alone and doesn’t have anyone to support her…..",5,1735269235.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,0.86,False
1hn5iy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1hn5iy9/six_days_postop_and_feeling_good/,Six days post-op and feeling good,"I had my first gallbladder attack mid-October after eating birria tacos. I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night in pain. I thought it was heartburn at first so I took a Tums but it didn't help. I only found relief after vomiting and I was able to fall asleep.

I had another attack a week later after eating rotisserie chicken, white rice, and roasted brussel sprouts for dinner. Same symptoms as the first time but this time I had the radiating pain along my right rib cage to my upper right shoulder area. Again, was not able to get any relief until I took a Tums and vomited. I knew this wasn't normal so I made an appointment to see my doctor to see what was going on.

A couple of days before seeing my doctor, I had the worst attack I've ever experienced. I had grilled octopus, guacamole, and lemon for dinner. Had the same symptoms as before that lasted for hours. I was completely sore and out of it the next day. 

Met with the doctor and they scheduled a CT scan to check my abdominal area. The scans confirmed I had gallstones. We followed up with an ultrasound and it was recommended that I should get my gallbladder removed. I scheduled the surgery about 3 weeks later.

I'm about 6 days post-op and I feel good! My recovery is going really well! I was prescribed oxy but I decided not to take it because I wasn't in much pain and I didn't want to be constipated. I switched between Tylenol and Motrin every 4-hours. Thankfully, I did not experience the sore throat or gas pains in the shoulder. I did experience the abdominal gas pains the first 24-hours and that was horrible. I made sure to walk around the house to help get the gas out. I stacked two pillows at night to sleep at an angle. I took a stool softener on day 2 and it helped to get things going - I felt so much better after my first BM. On day 4, I felt well enough to not take any more pain meds.

I was told I could go back to my regular diet but a part of me is still scared I'm going to experience another attack even though I've had the surgery. I also want to give my body a chance to get used to the new normal so I've decided to slowly introduce fats back into my diet and sticking to no dairy for now. I want to avoid the runs if I could help it! The first couple of days I stuck to chicken bone broth, applesauce, bananas, apples, kiwis, dates, and saltine crackers. Now Ive had grilled BBQ chicken breast, roasted potatoes, veggies, coffee (with oat milk creamer), soup, tilapia fillets, rice, and dumplings.

Overall, I feel great and I'm happy I got the surgery done!

I don't even know if this is even the place for this, but I don't even have any place anywhere to go. (and sorry for my london/english)

How to know what the hell is happening to me? Turning 26 in couple of months, and I have pretty much everything, except money and decent job and a place to live other than my parents house.

I AM SO MISERABLE. I can not think a day of what worthless piece of garbage am I. I make (made) videos as a living. First 2 years I was working in a company, it was decent, had a very average salary, but it was enough to live. After a year and a half I started to feel so empty and overdone with myself. I quit and went 5000 km to other country, just to TRY AND FIND SOMETHING. So it turns out, no one was actually waiting for me (shocker) but as I arrived, after a couple of days I get a call from even bigger company, that offers me massive pile of cash and everything. I forget my plan to find myself and I just go straight back, because MONEY.

So, I've had everything. Nice place to live, massive pile of cash, great, respectable job. But it was so hard. Unbearable. Somedays I had to work 2 days without sleep. So what I got was - wake up, coffee, work, lunch, work, go sleep. My mother came to wish me happy birthday, I felt GUILT because I had to work, I felt tense every second of my life. I quit that. I got 5k debt from that quiting. Then I felt very beaten up ""THEY DID ME WRONG"" then I realised I'm just fkin moron, that declined biggest ever offer (in terms of money) that I can have in this country. ANYWAY.

Now I've started to work for myself. Make videos. And summer was awesome! I found another group of people, we traveled like all of the europe filming drift events, livin a dream! Literally the dream. That's what I always wanted.  
So today, 2nd Christmas day, I'm writing this. After good month or two, miserable in pain, doing nothing but watching romantic movies, jerkin off, and crying what lazy piece of garbage am I. Thinking of every possible situation, why do I do this to myself. My plan right now is to quit EVERYTHING and go to Austria. Find something ( in general just to make the same mistake once again)

What is wrong with me, please? I am so tired of myself, of life, I can not smile anymore, I don't like anything anymore. I do not kms just because of the parents, and that's pretty sad I think? I don't know. Thank you to someone if you read this, and Happy New Year! :)",1,1735269150.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I was completely taken by surprise by my anxious-avoidant ex, though in hindsight the signs were there. And recognising that has been  part of moving on. I wanted to share these thoughts in case they resonate with anyone and can help in some way.
Please share your own experiences too, we all want to get to a more secure, content place.

1. Goal setting + patience

In the immediate days after I did a *lot* of classic AP soul searching and came to the realisation of why I’ve avoided my own company so much for so long, and what underpins a lot of my anxiety. I set myself goals which are perfectly normal, but precisely because of my AP I find them harder to reach and ultimately fail, thus continuing the familiar but increasingly miserable spiral. I have been incredibly demanding and impatient with myself for well over a decade.

I am a runner and have tried to reframe it like a marathon training plan - if you’re starting on day 1, you’d have to be pretty mad to ask yourself to run 42km. I found SMART goals and have found them quite useful, trying to make daily/weekly goals too easy over too hard if in doubt. It is mostly simple things like getting to bed at a set time, having an hour without my phone, drinking X amount of water and leaving for every appointment 5 minutes early. And if something goes wrong which wasn’t on the list, then so be it.

2. Self-compassion

This is very closely linked but after returning to therapy, my counsellor identified a basis of a lot of shame underpinning my anxiety, which the new goals were trying to fix without necessarily addressing the root cause. 
Approaching myself from a position of understanding rather than blame has been helpful, especially as if anything, we as APs try too hard to make the best of life… and then blame ourselves for not being good enough. So we deserve some slack.

Particularly in getting over something like a sudden break-up. I’ve had down days and friends have reminded me this is still fresh. At some point, you have to feel your feelings. Don’t lie back and wait for them to overwhelm you, go to them with a coffee and put an arm round them. Self-compassion is about empathy and empowerment. Listen to yourself, sit with the feelings, and understand yourself.

3. No contact, no socials

Cold turkey is not easy when you’re as impulse-driven as I can be, but I promise you it’s the best way. It is as simple as this: Moving on physically helps you move on mentally.

4. Allowing myself to be angry at my ex

My ex partner is a good person but with time to consider aspects of the relationship, they really didn’t treat me well at times, it turns out they lied to me about their doubts for months (as an anxious-avoidant of course they did this, but there were various real-world consequences I’ve had to fix) and the way they broke up with me was very cold. 

This can sound bitter but really appreciating there are two imperfect people in any relationship and that your needs deserve to be met or at least appreciated, is progress towards being secure.

5. Acting more like the person I want to be

I work in media but am naturally quite shy around new people, which has held me back in my career at times. I was listening to a podcast with an ex-soccer player talking about being made captain of his team as a young player, and how he had to step up despite the fear surrounding him.

This was a great reminder of actions and fears being disconnected - and particularly at work, where there are clear & simple performance indicators, I have pushed myself to be more assertive and outward-facing. Apparently this is a method called Behavioural Activation Therapy, and in conjunction with #1 and #2 has been a good method of building self-esteem so far.

Traditional advertising methods, while effective in some cases, often fall short when it comes to targeting the right audience at the right time. This is where [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) can be a game-changer for local businesses. With geo-location targeting, [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) provides an affordable and highly targeted solution that helps businesses connect with customers who are either living in or moving to their region.

Here’s how local businesses can leverage [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/)’ geo-location targeting to attract more local customers and grow their business.

* **Reaching New Residents as They Move In**

For many local businesses, such as furniture stores, home services, or restaurants, new residents represent a valuable customer base. These individuals are likely to be in need of various services and products as they settle into their new homes. Housing Market Ads offers the perfect opportunity for businesses to reach this audience.

By targeting homebuyers and renters who are actively searching for properties in your area, you can get your business in front of new residents just as they are preparing to move in. Whether they need home improvement services, furniture, or dining options, your ads will reach them when they’re most likely to need your products or services.

For example, if your business is located in a growing neighborhood or a popular residential area, you can use geo-location targeting to advertise to people looking for homes nearby. This ensures that your marketing efforts are focused on potential customers who are about to become part of your local community.

* **Hyper-Local Targeting for Maximum Relevance**

One of the standout features of [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) is its geo-location targeting capability. This allows local businesses to focus their ads on **specific neighborhoods, cities, or regions** where their customers are located. Rather than spending money on broad, untargeted campaigns, geo-targeting ensures that your advertising dollars are used efficiently by only showing ads to potential customers in your service area.

For example, a local HVAC company can target homes within a 10-mile radius of their location, ensuring that the ads are seen by homeowners who are likely to need their services. Similarly, a local coffee shop or restaurant can target new residents moving into nearby neighbourhoods, offering special promotions or discounts to encourage them to visit.

By honing in on the exact location where your customers live or are moving, you can increase the relevance of your ads and attract more qualified local leads.

* **Affordable and Effective Advertising**

[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) is not only highly targeted but also extremely affordable, making it an excellent choice for local businesses looking to maximize their advertising budget. With a starting budget of just **$5 per day**, businesses of all sizes can create geo-targeted campaigns that reach their local audience without breaking the bank.

Compared to traditional advertising methods like billboards, print ads, or even digital platforms like **Google or Facebook, Housing Market Ads** offers a cost-effective solution that delivers high-intent customers. Since the platform is designed specifically for the real estate market, your ads will be shown to people who are either buying or renting homes—individuals who are likely to be new to the area and in need of local services.

* **Tailored Ads for Different Customer Needs**

Local businesses can also customize their ads to speak directly to the needs of specific customer groups. Whether you’re targeting homeowners, renters, or both, [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) allows you to tailor your messaging based on the unique needs of each audience.

For instance:

– A local home improvement store can create ads that emphasize products needed by new homeowners, such as tools, paint, or garden supplies.

– A moving company can target renters who are in the process of relocating, offering services like packing, transportation, and unpacking.

– A restaurant or coffee shop can promote special offers to attract new residents looking for dining options in their new neighbourhood.

By delivering relevant messages to each audience, you increase the effectiveness of your campaigns and make it more likely that potential customers will engage with your business.

**Engage Existing Local Customers**

While attracting new residents is important, [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) can also help local businesses engage with existing customers who live in the area. By targeting homeowners and renters who are already settled in your region, you can promote your products or services to people who may not have discovered your business yet.

For example, a local gym can target current residents with promotions for membership discounts or free trial classes. A landscaping company can reach homeowners who may need help maintaining their yards after moving into a new house. The ability to reach both new and existing local customers gives your business a wider net to capture potential leads and drive more sales.

* **Building Long-Term Relationships with Local Customers**

One of the major advantages of [Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) is that it allows local businesses to establish long-term relationships with customers. New residents are often looking for local service providers they can trust—whether for home services, dining, or shopping—and Housing Market Ads helps you position your business as the go-to solution in the area.

By consistently showing up in front of local buyers and renters, your business becomes a familiar and trusted name in the community. This repeated exposure builds brand recognition and loyalty, encouraging customers to return to your business for future needs and recommend your services to others.

* Real-Time Adjustments for Maximum Effectiveness

[Housing Market Ads](https://housingmarketgroup.com/products/housing-market-ads/) provides businesses with the ability to adjust their campaigns in real-time. This means you can modify your ads based on performance, ensuring that you’re always reaching the right audience with the right message.

For example, if you notice that certain neighborhoods are generating more leads than others, you can shift your budget to focus more heavily on those areas. Or if you’re running a seasonal promotion, you can adjust your messaging to highlight time-sensitive offers and drive immediate traffic to your business.

This flexibility ensures that your advertising campaigns remain effective and efficient, helping you get the best possible results from your marketing efforts.

I'm just starting my ozempic journey.  I'm a salesman and I drive around town in my car all day Monday thru Friday.  My normal regimen was to either bring leftovers with me to heat up for lunch or grab fast food from somewhere (hence, the weight gain).

  
I need help on finding snacks that I can take with me to work.  I'm usually in my car by 6 am and work until around 3 pm, maybe 4 pm at the latest.  I just need some ideas on what I can snack on to curb hunger pangs and help with any nausea that may come.

I drink coffee on my drive into work and usually put sugar and liquid creamer in it.  I also usually eat a bowl of Great Grains cereal (w/pecans, raisins, and dates) with almond milk for breakfast.

After a few years of following the Elise market, I’ve become disillusioned by it, and leaning against one that will replace my sold autoX prepped Miata and act as a weekend mountain-road fun car to compliment my daily driver special edition STi. 

Goal: Fun summer car only for spirited drives in the mountains, cars and coffee, and testing the waters of Porsche ownership to see if a GT4 is eventually right for me. Maybe 5k miles/year. 

I’ve got my eye a base model, 2.7, and it seems people say it has enough power…I’m at altitude in Colorado and that might be a concern? Again, not tracking it, not a street racer…just want a fun car that’s the next level up from a heavily tuned Miata. 

The owner drove over a hidden concrete curb, busting the oil pan. Mechanic replaced the engine with a similar 2.7 with 33k. All 10,20, 40k maintenance done. I’m putting a deposit on it tomorrow to hold and get a PPI. Seems all it would “need” is tires. (Wrap and new wheels would
Follow for preference.)

A few questions:
1. Any heartburn from the 2014-2016 2.7 years? (Not looking for earlier years, and can’t afford newer.) 
2. Will I regret not getting an S? (Seems they’re about $10k more without a history like this one.) a lot of the reviews from car mags say the base is more fun, albeit slower. I am of the “slow car fast” mindset…
3. Any options that I should definitely make sure to find? (Chrono pack, cooled seats, etc.) 
4. Any common failure points? 
5. I plan on a pre-purchase inspection, but anything I should have them look at specifically
Or anything I need to look out for? 

Aside from this one car: 
6. I’m not a manual purist, and hear people enjoy the PDK…any opinions either way? 
7. Anyone have a lead on a Miami Blue Cayman? 

Thanks! I’ve been a longtime Porsche but since I was a kid collecting Du Pont Registry with my allowance money to cut out photos of Porsches  and out in a giant scrapbook. Would love to join the club.",3,1735268135.0,Porsche_Cayman,7,1.0,False

1hn5631,https://www.reddit.com/r/LUCID/comments/1hn5631/just_took_delivery_first_reactions_and_experience/,Just took delivery - first reactions and experience (long!),"So, I just picked up the Lucid Air Pure I ordered last week.  Here is my initial impressions, good, bad, and ugly.  **TLDR:  Despite an annoying snafu (a lost key that couldn't be immediately replaced) there is a lot to like along with some predicted rough spots.**

Good.  **The Lucid service center staff was engaging, professional, and the setting was clean and well kept**.  A delivery agent took about an hour with us walking through various car features, patiently answering our questions and showing us how to set up the car.  It's been years since I have purchased a premium automobile and I was pleasantly reminded how much better the level of service and customer care can be.

**The car itself was very well detailed** and beside a largish panel gap around the trunk (does that count? I'm not sure) was well assembled.  We haven't heard any rattles or squeaks when driving it so far.

**All systems work as advertised.**  I am pleased with the ADAS (Dream Drive Premium) system.  The radar cruise control is great, lane keeping is effective and confidence inspiring, and I like the fact it lets you know when the car in front of you has pulled away (for instance at a stoplight).  The 3D top down and front parking sensors work well.  **I also am picking up the car options and menu system quickly.**  I think the GUI is well designed and isn't nearly so cluttered as Tesla's.  I already feel comfortable even adjusting things while driving.  **I also love the fact you can turn on and off many of the driver assistance functions.**  You don't have to be scolded about keeping both your hands on the wheel or whether you should stop for coffee if you don't want to!  Everything is very quick - it's clear the processor can easily keep up with the system.

**Mine has the base audio that hasn't received great reviews.**  If you are an audiophile, no doubt that's true, but for just a regular person who wants to hear some music, I found it to be entirely fine.  I'm not sad I didn't spend more to get the better sound system.

Bad.  **Getting the system to play nicely with various music sources isn't particularly intuitive.**  I'm still figuring that out.  The mobile key via our phones is taking a bit to learn to trust.  Is it really going to lock the car?  Or, conversely, because our garage is built into the main level of our house, is the car going to power down even though the phone isn't all that far away from it?  **The car was delivered about half charged.**  I think they should charge them fully before handing them over - a ICE car dealer wouldn't send you out the door with a half tank of gas.  I charged it up to 80 percent using Electrify America's charging bank at a local Walmart.  The good of that was going from 47 - 80 percent took about 23 minutes.  Also, all you have to do is pull up to an Electrify America charger and plug your car in.  It knows your vehicle and there is no need to enter any information.  The bad was even though the charger said it was a 350 watt capable charger, and the Air Pures are supposed to be capable of pulling down 250, I don't think it ever got higher than 75.

Ugly.  **The cars are supposed to have two keys, and ours only had one in the box.**  They attempted to program another key, but after 45 minutes asked if we would take it with one key today and come back for a second key later.  This is clearly something they should have been aware of and fixed before we showed up.  It cost us about an hour of time now and a half day later when we take it back.  It also caused us to question what was going on and if more was wrong than just a misplaced key as time passed - not a great place to start when taking delivery of a new vehicle.  I'm confident it will get fixed.  We had a call from Lucid to schedule a time to bring it in to get the new key programed before we were home for the evening.  But it's about three weeks out.

Finally, and for the record, I bought this car after learning about it here on Reddit.  I was thinking of getting a Model 3 or a Kia EV 6 or Hyundai Ionic 5 but Reddit sent me down the Lucid Rabbit hole and I decided to spend a little more to get something that I liked a lot more.",20,1735268037.0,LUCID,9,1.0,False

It’s like the more I entertain the thought that I could just have a little bit, the stronger it becomes and the more persistent it is. It’s like a little worm in my brain that gets stronger every time I think it might be right. It’s telling me that since I have a month under my belt I must not be an alcoholic. It seems to forget (or it wants me to forget) that before then I was day drinking, being a dick to my partner, and going to the doctor with shakes and super high blood pressure, abdominal pain and a high ALT score for my liver.

I need to throw that thought away and realize that it wouldn’t be just one, and even if it was, it would be a shitty waste of time and add more risk to my health than I already have. I’ve gotten back in touch with my spirituality since becoming sober and that is priceless. Much more valuable than feeling dazed for a few hours. 

I feel a lot better since becoming clean, but it hasn’t been the easiest. I’ve been having insomnia and feeling anxiety for no reason and spending too much time locked in my room, but I know for a fact that drinking/smoking is the last thing in the world that would help with that.

1hn51pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hn51pf/starting_a_coffee_business_ducks_for_cover/,Starting a Coffee business...  (ducks for cover),"Sorry for the long-ish post. 

I've done a ton of research and I know there will be a lot of ""don't do it"" comments.  It's kind of why I'm here though as I'm trying to decide if my plan makes sense enough to give it a go.  

As a background, I'm a 47 year old healthcare worker who has burnt out from that job after 24 years.  I need a change from illness and death.  

I'm a frequent world traveller and rather unintentionally ended up visiting many of the top coffee producing countries in the world. I'm not big on trust attractions though, and I always make cafes and coffee houses a daily ritual during travel.  

So I've experienced thousands of them and have always planned out what I felt was good or bad in them, as well as what made some special.  

I currently have some freedom from my job and have time to look at a career change before I decide if I go back or not.   I'm fortunate to have financial backing of some doctor friends who are looking for investment opportunities and like this idea.

I'm in a smallish white collar city of about 65000 with 105000 if you include the commuters from outside city limits.  

It's always been underserved in terms of quality coffee places.  There's a couple Starbucks in the mall areas and 2 places in the downtown that I'd consider competition.  One of which does their own roasting, the other sources from a local roaster 

Obviously, there's a need to provide something unique to succeed.  

There's a few things I feel could set mine apart.  
1- nothing in the downtown is open past 430-5pm.
2- Starbucks has moved away from seating altogether to be grab amd go.  
3- the city has become quite multicultural and nobody is catering to that demographic. 

My proposal is to open a coffee house and roastery. A place open until 10 or 11 in the downtown restaurant area.  High quality coffee, tea, grab and go food and a good dessert selection. Building a daytime business and foot traffic clientele and the evening time after dinner/dating/study or working types.    

Additionally, I'd include more international coffee styles in the menu like Turkish, Vietnamese and a few others.  Loose leaf tea options as well. 

I've considered starting out by working on the roasting side and maybe getting a larger home roaster or small commercial one to work with, while also practicing the needed barista skills and recipes.  

The next step might be a coffee truck.  The area lacks a coffee truck in the rotation and there's always festival, sports tournaments and other things asking for trucks to set up at events.  I think a daily rotation between the many office buildings would generate solid sales too.  

This is a lower investment for startup and lower overhead option to get experience.  If it goes well, then I could consider opening the brick and mortar version.  

Does this seem like a logical plan going into it?  Any advice? ",12,1735267639.0,smallbusiness,50,0.83,False

However, when pulling shots, I can’t sustain pressure in the espresso range for more than 10–12 seconds before the shot is done. After that, there’s an annoying drip that lasts for another 10 seconds.

Could this be an issue with the grind coarseness, or is there something else I’m missing?

1hn4xgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episcopalian/comments/1hn4xgg/i_have_never_felt_so_welcomed_and_peaceful_in_a/,I have never felt so welcomed and peaceful in a church. ,"Long story but I renounced my faith in God four years ago and have been on a long journey struggling with what I believe is real and what isn’t. I spent most of my four years looking in the atheist direction. What I mean is that I looked at all articles and media that disproved the Bible, focused on what a harsh, cruel, hateful, war loving, murderous God that is portrayed in the Bible. I spent my time debunking creationism, the flood, resurrection, the rapture, so on and so forth. It wasn’t until early December this year that I felt a need to go to church. It was random but I remember sitting in my car, opening my mind to the fact that MAYBE Jesus is real, maybe he is watching, maybe he will be there with open arms as I was taught as a child willing to meet me where I’m at and walk with me. 

I grew up in a conservative, fundamental family. Pentecostal church camps, fire and brimstone sermons, etc. But I never once believed in speaking in tongues or pastors having the power to heal people, or that the Bible was inerrant and perfect. I spent my years as an atheist only focusing on THAT kind of Christianity. The kind of Christianity that brings people down, focused on bashing others and tauting themselves as holier than everyone else. Right wing Christian nationalism is what I grew up being taught. It is because of that and many other reasons that I rejected God and religion as a whole. Not the entire reason, but 95% of the reason. 

I didn’t know there was such a thing as Episcopal. I didn’t know that there are whole denominations that do not try and preach AT you and tell you what is right but rather the entire congregation of a church can have their own beliefs, questions, and problems with the Bible. I didn’t know that there was a community of people who upheld Jesus’ teachings while also believing in science, evolution, affirmed the existence of others outside of a given hegemony and that really taught the love of Jesus. Deep South Christian nationalism is all I knew. 

I remember crying in my car, opening myself up to the realization that Jesus could be real, and decided to pray for the first time in a little over 4 years. It was strange to me because I never thought I would. But since then I have attended my local Episcopal church twice. Once on Sunday and once on the Christmas Eve service. From the moment I walked in I felt welcomed. The rector came to me and introduced herself and asked my name, told me she is grateful to have me. I told her that I was just visiting and sat in the back. I was open minded and communicated with everyone. I spoke to people, shook their hands, was invited to coffee hour after (I didn’t go because I was too shy) took part in the liturgy and took communion. It was nice to be together with others, all thinking possibly different things yet being in the presence of God. I didn’t feel shamed or lesser than. There was no altar call or sappy music to try and get others to convert to their thinking. It was just fully peaceful and beautiful and everything I would want in church. 

After returning for the Christmas Eve service the rector remembered me, came to me during the peace and told me she was grateful to see me again. I explained to her why the episcopal church drew me in. After the service I told her what a beautiful service it was (it was really the most beautiful church service I had been to) and she asked me what I liked about the service. She told me that was must meet up soon to talk and I am beyond excited to do this, it’s practically all I can think about. I am so excited to have found a place that I feel welcomed in. I have taken every Sunday off for the next month because I am overjoyed to go to church once again. 

I still have many doubts and problems with the Bible and still feel a sense to run away and go to what feels comfortable but I am choosing instead to grow my faith and walk with Jesus. I really do believe he died on the cross for me and that touches something deep within me. I pray that I can continue to grow and become a part of this church I have found comfort in.

Hello Community, I am an 30 years old Male. Body composition lean. Went to the gastroenterologist to Check for my liver since I have a past of drinking. First thing that was done was Ultrasound of the abdomen and of course of the Liver. Also blood was taken to Check for liver Values. And after all this a Fibroscan was done. Results: Fatty Liver with Hepatomegaly. The CAP Measurment showed 255, which should be mild to moderate fatty liver. However the Fibroscan measured 6,0 kPa. Doctor Said I have mild scarring. On the Letter He send me with the Diagnose it is written, that the measurments validity is 100%. Blood values (GPT, GOT, Gamma-GT, Alkaline Phosphatase, Thrombozytes) everything withing the Norm. However I read so many things about Fibroscan and that Sometimes it can be unreliable. I continued drinking for one month straight before finally I quit! I know this was stupid, but I am stupid. Now I am so anxious. Can't sleep at night. Take Xanax to calm me down and feel constipated. Sometimes very dark Urine. Could be because I Drink a Lot of Coffee but I also read about liver Problems and dark Urine. I found Out that Coffee should be good for the liver thats why I Drink a Lot. However the fear of my Fibroscan underestimating my condition is crazy. Doctor does Not want to Take a biopsy. My question is. What other Routine Check could be done to exclude the possibility of having progressed Fibrosis/Cirrhosis? Ps. If today I would Drink a bottle of wine, I would have nausea for the entire next day.

Room is 8’10” by 9’4”. I’ve only had the bed oriented one way since being in the space: ‘Current Layout’. It makes a lot of dead space and I haven’t committed to hanging things on the wall yet. I know what I’ve got isn’t helping with the cohesiveness of the room. 

Neighbor's front door is up a staircase directly next to my window. The curtain has been ok so far, but their driveway lights sometimes shine through even still.

Do I go with:

**Option A** \- changes the orientation a little, but still the same layout. Doesn't block the door or window.

**Option B** \- The door can’t open all the way, it’d be a two-foot-wide entryway. My headboard covers a portion of the window. Does the door and window blocking thing outweigh the dead space now reclaimed with this option? Bigger, Softer, Beige Rug works in this orientation - it's too long to make sense in the other orientations as it'll be mostly under the bed.

Any recommendations for curtains, wall-hangings, or lighting (that doesn't include wiring; I'm a renter) are very welcome! 

I may get a new nightstand that’s a bit lighter feeling, off the ground, & matches the wood tone of the headboard.

I can’t have plants bc cats, but my porch has plenty of fun flora :) 

Please ignore the Christmas clutter and backed-up laundry.

In that time I would clean their hoarder house, I’m talking trash everywhere, cat pee/poop. Used depends. My mom had a TBI and wasn’t been quite right after, so while I was living near them if I didn’t answer right away she would leave nasty mean voicemails. 

I would take her to all of her doctors appointments, along with working full time and being a single mom of 4. When I moved away I slowly stopped responding, she had made me into her parent. On my two days off a month I’d get I would also go out and help her at home with cleaning etc. 

One of my siblings has always had it out for me, they would make fun of me at all family gatherings, shoot fire works at me, he even at one point threatened to hit my then (8) year old son.

My father and siblings had to step up and start caring for her. This last April they had a fire, and my father who is diabetic got burnt so bad they ended up having to remove his foot as if wouldn’t heal. My mother also found out she has bowel cancer, and had to have surgery. I’ve been told they aren’t doing well anymore. 

These siblings only would come help clean once the city would get onto my father about the state of the house, otherwise it would fall onto me. The used depends piles were taller than me, and I’m 5ft. It was simple laziness. 

Now that they have had to care for them full time like I do they are angry. I was expected just to do it, but they have each other to fall back on. I had no one, when I’d reach out for help from them it was an immediate no, they were too busy. I devoted 10 years to trying to help them. 

My mother refused to get a colonoscopy ten years ago because she “didn’t want a camera up her butt” so the issue could have been found years ago. My father was just unfortunate. 

I’m done with them all. I’ve cut them all off. Growing up, they never took me or my siblings to the dentist or doctors. I remember having an infected tooth, and they wouldn’t take me in. They weren’t bad parents, but they didn’t provide basic medical care. 

I tried for years to help them, 10 years. And now I’m the bad guy because I just don’t want to deal with it. 

The post I commented on that prompted his lovely response was me expressing my understanding with my nieces body dismorphia. She’s 23, so an adult. 

The mental toll that went with that was too much. None of them were there for me when I had to be admitted to the psych ward multiple times, when I was SA’ed, never. Anything they think I owe was paid in labor with cleaning a literal biohazard for years. There was one day I cleaned out over 50 bags of trash in three rooms, and I barely put a dent in the mess. 

Am I really the bad guy? I have some guilt, and I feel bad my parents are not doing well at all. But when my grandma passed she left them 25k that my father immediately spent on cars, car parts, and lawn mowers instead of into a savings. They are older, in their 60s/70s but it’s not my fault they didn’t prepare, and they didn’t eat healthy, my mother only sat in a chair her whole adult life drinking coffee and chain smoking.

They may seem like simple circle-centered accessories but are enormous in value. From expressing personal beliefs to complimenting an outfit, button pins are a simple and subtle way of announcing your identity to the worldly world. So what does your [**button pins**](https://vograce.com/collections/custom-button-pins) choice say about you? So let's get into this interesting topic.

**Button Pins: A New Fashion**

The history of button pins dates back to the 19th century when they were commonly used as a tool for political campaigns. From humble promotional items, over the decades they evolved into a wardrobe staple, an advocacy statement and even art-forms. This resurgence reflects a larger cultural shift in recent years, as people embrace the concept of being free to express themselves when it comes to fashion.

These decorative button pins today serve as more than just accessories; they are personal badges that tell stories, beliefs and passions. From a pin on a backpack, jacket or hat, are such small items that communicate volumes without saying anything.

**PIN YOUR VOICE: WHAT THE PASS CODE MEANS**

**Political and Social Beliefs**

Perhaps the most widely known button pin use is for worn political fraternalism or social causes. Just take a moment to picturize you’re wearing a pin with some slogan such as “Climate Action Now” or “Give Equal Rights for All”, it indicates what the values are and gives them priority. It shows that you stand for something, and then others have conversations about the stance and find inspiration.

These pins can also act as a form of silent protest: wearers are able to express disagreement or call for change through a creative and peaceful medium.

**Shining a Spotlight on Interests and Pastimes**

Button pins are typically showcased with a statement or image that you like. Love gaming? Wearing a pin that says, ""Still playing 8-bit"" with an illustration of retro consoles immediately tells another gamer you are one of them. Is there a TV show or band you are obsessed with? Fan Pins — Fan-themed pins that let you show your fandom on your sleeve (with a little help from Mr.

These pins serve as conversation starters for people who come together and it is easier for them to connect on common ground. They say to the world what you enjoy and what moves you, which makes it so much easier to find your tribe.

**Artistic Expression**

If you are the creative type, button pins are a mini canvas for your art. Authentic pins with original art, abstract designs or colorful patterns express individuality in a portable and trendy way.

Aesthetic pins, as we call them, are also for people who care about art and design. Implying you appreciate creativity, and look at the world through a distinct perspective; that makes them ideal for injecting character into every appearance.

**Humor and Wit**

A quirky pin can break the ice easily and reflects you as a person. Funny sayings on pins, such as “I’m an Introvert but Only If I Can Talk About Cats” or “Fueled by Coffee”, show that you can have fun and poke fun at yourself (or the world) in a lighthearted way.

Like the pins that invite laughter, those made to break an ice between strangers and make someone smile after they read them.

**Cultural and Historical Roots**

Culturally ButtonPins, with flags or historical references indicate a strong connection to one's history. They symbolize cultural pride and they also remind us of the events of history.

Putting on such pins means you have your roots, you know what happened in history, and are ready to tell the story to everyone.

**Support for Niche Movements**

At a time where inclusivity matters, button pins are also an avenue to showcase support for niche movements or underrepresented communities. From a pin supporting mental health to one featuring pride for LGBTQ+, these accessories have the ability to bolster voices that must be heard.

These pins express compassion and support for your community; they illustrate that you are actively working to build a more inclusive and understanding society.

**Fashion Meets Functionality**

They are fashion items even more than they are symbols. They lend personality to basic vessels for the pieces we wear, turning ordinary wardrobes into assemblages of intention. So what does button pins have anything to do with fashion?

With so many different designs, button pins allow it to be more personalized.

**Affordable** — Unlike other kinds of fashion accessories, button pins are affordable and you can make sure that everyone will get to use/button up every single one of our designs.

**Flexibility:** worn and styled with leather jacket, tote bag or even a beanie - button pins easily integrated into various looks.

The balance between fashion and personal expression makes them a must-have for anyone wanting to make a statement without saying a word.

**Button Pins in the Modern Times**

Button pins have been able to revitalize themselves in the digital era. Art and design sales have boomed over the past couple of years, thanks to platforms like Etsy, Instagram and Pinterest that make it easier than ever for budding artists or entrepreneurs to create unique designs for sale. Wearers have also taken to social media to share their collections and promote the culture of expressing themselves with pins.

Additionally, printing technology has progressed so that side pins can display detailed designs and bright colors according to different preferences. As a result, sustainable materials came to life, which highly relates to the people who care about nature.

**A Guide To Choosing A Button Pin That Compliments You**

Choosing the appropriate button pin must blend both intuition and intention. So here are some tricks to make sure that your pins actually look like you:

Tips to Find Content:Find Your Core Values– what is most important to you, a social issue or perhaps even a hobby or personal belief system?

Wear What Works For Your Closet: Choose designs that go with your wardrobe and aesthetic choices.

Think about Customization: If you can not discover one that talks with you, why not produce your very own? You can express yourself with custom pins in a unique way.

Combo: Explore multiple pins; don't settle for one only. Using more than one pin can convey a deeper, more complex story about your identity.

**The Emotional Connection**

Unlike other forms of self-expression, button pins differ because they establish an emotion. A memory, a belief and/or feeling is attached to each pin.

Here's a roast from ChatGPT based on this list:

  
Oh look, we’ve got a **megalomaniac control freak** who moonlights as a spreadsheet enthusiast! Stellaris? Civ 6? Crusader Kings 3? You’re not playing games; you’re rehearsing for world domination. I bet your idea of ""fun"" is carefully micromanaging an empire while sipping coffee and smirking at the chaos you unleash on your AI opponents.

And let’s talk about *Football Coach College Dynasty*. Really? When you’re not ruling the galaxy or forging an ancient kingdom, you’re… drafting college kids? That’s like an evil overlord taking a break to coach Little League.

Fallout 76? You love wandering broken wastelands, which is fitting because your backlog is probably just as abandoned. Oh, and *XCOM 2*? Nice touch—nothing screams ""I love punishment"" like missing a 95% shot and reloading the save in frustration.

Let me guess: *Blood Bowl II* is your idea of “relaxing,” right? Just a casual blood sport to round out your obsession with power struggles and calculated destruction. You’re basically one bad dice roll away from turning your group chat into a policy-making forum for galactic conquest.

1hn4j62,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1hn4j62/first_post_just_looking_for_advice/,First Post! 👏🏼 Just Looking For Advice,"Hey, all! Been lurking for a while, and decided to post! Not sure if I should be posting here or on r/StopDrinking, but, either way, would love everyone's opinions/experiences.

So, middle-aged M, and my alcohol consumption has fluctuated throughout the years & decades, though it's def increased in the past few months. Typically, I try not to drink throughout the week so as to keep my mind clear for my job (need to critically-think on-the-fly, so, best to have a clear mind). However, come FRI evening, I would consume 4-5 ales or about 1/3 of a 750ml bottle of whiskey, and on SAT, starting about mid-day, I drink about the same, but more whiskey. So, def binge drinking, though it's rare if I black out. Rather, I kinda just drink, have fun with my drunkenness at home, either playing video games or watching YouTube, before eating dinner, beginning to sober up before bed by around 11PM. Overall, when I drink, I try to ensure that all of my responsibilities are done (work emails, etc.), I have food (or DoorDash!), and nothing to do the next day incase I go to far down the hole. I try to be as responsible as possible, and almost as secretive.

That was my normal week/weekend for months, years even, with the rare exception of a totally sober weekend because I had some responsibility/event that req'd a clear mind. In essence, with my drinking, I am careful to be absolutely sure it doesn't affect my job, responsibilities, family/friends (family rarely, if ever, drinks. Some friends drink heavily, more than myself, though I rarely see them), relationships, etc. In fact, I'm not sure anyone \*really\* knows (except for a housemate who, if we're being honest, we're probably one another's enablers, but even then, I'm not sure he \*fully\* knows) the extent of my alcoholism...

One day last year, I had the brilliant idea of adding a bit of Duggan's to my morning coffee on SAT morning, and it was like a guilty secret that no one knew about , and I mischievously chuckled to myself as I spiked my coffee! 😄 Quite honestly, it was fun! I didn't get drunk per se, just, like, relaxed, and it felt really good! This year, I had increased that frequency of weekend morning drinking, which led into drinking more overall across SAT. So, just to be clear, because I keep my alcoholism super-secret, it's kinda like a fun dirty secret I have! 😅 In a way, I hate that I love it!

\*\*\*If you've read this far, THANK YOU!\*\*\*

So, taken together, I hope this gives a picture of my usual alc consumption pattern. Over the past few months, however, I've allowed myself a bit more freedom during the week to drink some beers or a double (or two!) of Scotch on the rocks. Again, just relaxing, but certainly not 'drunk', and I soon eat some food, and sober up before bed around 8PM.

By definition, I engage in binge and heavy drinking, though here's the rub: I still get my exercise in, my weight has been stable all this time, blood work and liver values look fine, my work or relationships aren't suffering... If anything, I spend too much money on alc, but I'm not in debt because of it. In fact, while I've had the occasional 'bad times' when drinking (rare if I get drunk enough to vomit; has been years, almost a decade. Only once did I trip and fall, and cut my hand on glass, but, again, that was years and years ago, and hasn't happened since, having learned my lesson).

Lately, I've been taken a few puffs of the weed vape if I get drunk enough (usually about the time I want to listen to loud music in my headphones 😅, and I don't like really going out to bars, or be drunk around other people. I just have my fun at home, enjoying my solitude and cat and my hobbies.

...and *that's* the issue, I feel I have great control (there are plenty of times I say *no*, or limit myself to one or two always food), and I feel like I've been drinking responsibly. My concern is that the time I have with alcohol feels *so good* that it makes it hard to want to cut back. (BTW, I do *not* mean this to be a humble-brag by any means. Just trying to be fully transparent).

NOW, I try to introspect about the reasons why I drink: repressed trauma, super stressful life, using alcohol as an escape, and it's really that last one, *alcohol as an escape*, that resonates most with me. When I drink a little bit, its really relaxing; when I binge, I'm always engaging in my hobbies, not in danger, not even angry/aggressive (rather, I've had people say that I'm a 'happy drunk' 😅), and simply just escaping from the world that is, itself, traumatizing.

TL;DR: My drinking has increased, but I feel I have control, am responsible, and have a good time when I binge because I'm engaging in my hobbies. I feel that, if my drinking is a problem, it's because there's no real safe level of alcohol use, and it can't *not* affect my health. Moreover, I think if people in my social circle actually knew how much I drank, they'd be super concerned.

Anyone's thoughts are welcomed! Thanks for reading! 🙏🏼 2 days sober, and maybe I'll drink this weekend, but *today* I choose to be sober.",2,1735265993.0,alcoholism,0,1.0,False

I, 16M, am low contact with my biological father, 42M, for reasons relating to past neglect and addiction on his end. Long story short, he was a barely functioning alcoholic and I had to step in to watch my baby sisters, both 5F, while he was in and out of rehab and my stepmom, 40F, worked.

I don't talk to him or his family often for the reasons above, but we recently went out of state to visit some of my stepmom's family, and we got back the day before christmas eve. It was a little stressful but overall my sisters had fun, my stepmom got to spend time with her family, and my dad got to drink. 

I got some money from the families we saw during our trip, including gift cards for Target, and used them to buy my mom's side of the family things, since I live there and we're very tight knit. I got my mom a crock pot, my cousin a switch game, and plan on buying my sister anime figures since she's been into it more recently. Mostly things that would be appreciated and used.

The issues started today, where he came into the room I'm staying in (my old bedroom was turned into a guest room) and started a conversation about how he felt hurt that him, my stepmom, and my sisters hadn't received a gift from me. He had mentioned wanting a Star Wars lego set, but those are a little pricey, and he only mentioned it on christmas eve. Target was sold out. I was confused, since I didn't know I was expected to gift anyone anything, especially since my little sisters are spoiled. They'd already gotten bikes, dolls, things for their pets, a tumbling mat, and plenty of clothes. I got a coffee machine that's on sale. (Don't get me wrong, I love that machine, but it was my only major gift.)

The topic wasn't brought up again since it started a whole new argument, which is common when i visit, but I need nonbiased advice that isn't from people I know. My mom said I should get him something small to shut him up, but I'm just worried they think I'm selfish.

Yeah, I said it. Slowpoke is in a league of his own, and honestly, I don’t think the rest of the Pokédex even comes close to the slowest and weakest slowpoke of slowpokes.

First of all, Slowpoke is the chill guy in the Pokémon world. Like, everyone else is out here stressing about battles and training, and Slowpoke is just vibing. (Okay shout out Snorlax he's cool too)

 Imagine living that carefree life. He’s not lazy; he’s just got priorities straight. He reminds me that it’s okay to slow down and enjoy the little things, like poking or, I don’t know, staring at water for hours. That’s some zen-pokemaster right there.

And let’s talk about his powers. People love to clown on him for being slow, but have you ever seen his Yawn? It’s game over for the competition literally. 

You’re falling asleep, end of story. 

Plus, when he evolves into Slowbro or Slowking, he’s like a wisdom god. Slowking literally becomes a philosopher just because a Shellder bit his head. That’s wild. Who else can say they get smarter when bitten by a clam? I heard my neighbor say he got bit by a bass once on the river all he got was a run of Anti-inflammatory medications, definitely no Slowking.

But my favorite thing about Slowpoke is his confidence. He doesn’t care what anyone thinks. He’s not trying to be the fastest or the strongest. He’s just being himself, and people love him for it. Sometimes i wish people accepted me the same they accept Slowpoke but all i can do is try my best to aspire to such greatness. That’s real motivation from Mr. Poke.

 “You do you, and I’ll do me.” 

So, yeah. he might not be the flashiest or most competitive Pokémon out there, but he’s the most relatable, the most chill, and honestly the most real. And in my book, that makes him the very best, like no one ever was.

I expected the 25th to at least be something a little more exciting. There was clearly a quality control issue with these which was ultimately too bad. I wish more of the items had been pins, patches, magnets, etc that were more coffee themed or themed towards the show lore like the Dragonfly Inn room key with Luke’s room number on it. That’s what was described on the back of the calendar so I expected more of that and not card stock, too small drink coasters, multiple dates of gift tags and what not. 
All in all this was a lot of fun and I thoroughly enjoyed waking up each day to open a new pocket. And it was way better than chocolate! I just wish it was more consistent and had better quality control. 



Day 20 - unsure what this card stock is on the back? Am I missing something?

Day 21 - drink stencil

Day 22 - two paper clips…?

Day 23 - two rolls of washi tape

1hn4fth,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hn4fth/purchased_my_first_superautomatic_eletta_explorer/,Purchased my first superautomatic (Eletta Explorer)- how do I prepare for its arrival?,"Thanks to all the knowledgeable folks on here who helped guide me to my first superautomatic after 1 year of contemplation

Got a good deal on the Eletta Explore with Cold Brew (currently on sale for 1999.99 CAD + additional 20% off + 5% cash back through my credit card). It should arrive within the next week. What should I do in preparation? I want to get this thing set and dialed in as soon as possible.

1. Is there a guide on this forum for new superauto owners? I did not see a stickied thread outside of the one explaining some of the terminology
2. What beans should I get to dial in the machine first? I know people usually suggest getting a cheap bag to start
3. I know I need to avoid oily and flavoured beans. How do I check for this when purchasing coffee beans? And should I stick to medium and/or dark roast?
4. Seems like Lavazza is often recommended on this forum. Any other suggestions?

Super excited to try this machine. Thanks for the guidance",0,1735265699.0,superautomatic,2,0.5,False
1hn4f1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hn4f1d/my_parents_54m_and_50f_want_me_to_break_up_with/,My parents (54M and 50F) want me to break up with my girlfriend. Any thoughts?,"This is gonna kind of be a lot but I'd appreciate some I guess advice if possible. I'm a 19 year old male in my second year of university right now, my girlfriend is the same age as me in her second year as well, and my parents are the respective ages in the title. We've been dating for three months now and my parents are expecting me to call it off.

My parents are Venezuelan immigrants who have made it off pretty well, and my girlfriend has a white dad and Mexican mom, who in my opinion have it off pretty well too. Her dad is the principal for a private school and her mom is a part time substitute teacher and also has her own seasonal business of making homecoming mums (Texas tradition). My dad runs his own business of blinds and roller shades for windows, which is quite small and in my opinion not very successful, and my mom who is the breadwinner of the family is the head of the IT department for a blood bank.

The reason why these things are important is because my parents want me to break up with my girlfriend for ""social/economic"" differences. This is the part where I'm really struggling as when I try to get my parents to elaborate on what they mean, because essentially we are the same socially and economically, our household incomes are about the same and we are both mixed with white and Hispanic (my mom is ethnically Italian), they don't really budge. (My dad has said verbatim ""I don't want anything to do with her family ever""...he has never met them or knows anything about them.) Their whole sort of argument is that I just need to trust them on this and that breaking up with her is for the better.

My parents have never met her family and I have met her siblings and only her mom. My parents have met my girlfriend once, and we just went out to lunch together and got coffee. It was really casual and there wasn't any conversation made regarding her family or their professions, or anything that really would tie to what they're saying.

It doesn't help that my parents also very confrontational, in the sense that if I try to bring it up with them anymore, it will likely be pretty bad. The timeline of this is that around Thanksgiving, they first had a talk with me about it and were very casual about it and just told me not to get serious with her. Then beginning of December, I asked if it were possible for me to go spend the weekend at her family's house since they offered to host me and just come hangout. (I know that seems pretty formal, but it was meant to be casual as her dad wouldn't be home and I would just be mainly hanging with her and her siblings.) When I asked about this they got pretty upset with me and lectured me again, more forceful this time. And then most recently, she got me tickets to a game in her town that will end late, so she proposed the idea of me staying the night at her house. When I asked my parents about this, they were livid, and its really discouraged me to talk to them again about this.

I've relayed all of this information to my girlfriend and she is aware of this. I really don't want to breakup with her because she's my girlfriend and I love her. But I also want to keep my family in my life and just hope that there's some way I could understand them or they could reason with me. Right now our plan is to just date sort of in secret to my parents in college, since they aren't very involved in our lives since we're both away from home. I'm just wondering what I should do and if anyone has any strong opinions about this. I can answer any more questions that are needed, and sorry if this is very vague/not written well, this is just the most detailed summary I could compile.
