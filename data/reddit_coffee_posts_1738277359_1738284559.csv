1ie2int,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1ie2int/being_a_handsome_guy_doesnt_end_loneliness/,Being a handsome guy doesn't end loneliness,"21M. I'm regularly called handsome by both men and women, I'm a few modeling agencies, I've had dozens of hookups, plenty of women interested in me... and yet, I've never felt so lonely. I'm a bit tired of all the people pretending that being handsome as a man will solve your problems and your loneliness. It doesn't, it can still suck.

My looks aren't the only thing about me, obviously. I'm also a musician and singer, I'm a huge film and music nerd, I exercise weekly and I always try to be fun and care about the the people I meet, without being too needy either.

Most of my friendships feel unfulfilling. Since moving to the city, I've only made like 2 to 3 actual friends, despite going to two different graduate schools, and I don't get to see them often. The rest of my friendships are online, either people I've never met in real life or friends from high school I haven't been able to see since I moved. And for a lot of them as well, I can't tell them shit since they will either not care about my personal issues or take forever to answer. Lately, I've just been thinking about how hard it is for me to form actual, healthy friendships. Maybe I'm too weird. Maybe people don't wanna be friends with people on the spectrum, even if it's mild.

I've always been extremely unlucky in love, and I've reached a point where I convinced myself I could only be happy through sex and hookups. Therefore, I've been mostly selling myself as such on dating apps. While it is still hurtful, this is possibly the better option for me, as actually looking for love will actually be worse for my mental health. I'm gonna get to this, but no matter the nature of the relationship, I've always felt treated like shit by the women I meet.

More recently, I've been specific about wanting to create actual FwB connections. And from there on, there are two scenarios: either the girl won't want me to be anything else but being her pretty one-night-stand boy, or she will accept to go on with it at first, and then reject me at the first occasion they got for a slightly better option, always acting as I wouldn't get hurt anyway. I could get off the apps, but these small moments when I'm with someone are like glimpses of satisfaction I can't get enough of.

I have high standards when it comes the person I wanna be in a romantic relationship with, that pickiness coming from a lot of bad experiences. It has become extremely rare for me to fall in love with someone and, as of now, I have become virtually loveless. Not too long ago, I've been emotionally destroyed by my brief relationship with a girl. We were never actually partners or even had sex, but she was so kind and fun to me while we were seeing each other. She was everything I could dream about, physically and mentally. Our fling lasted about a month, going on coffee dates and making out in nightclubs, before she ended everything to go back with her cheating ex. Based on what she told me afterwards, I'm starting more and more to believe that, despite the connection we had, she mostly saw me as a handsome rebound that she didn't care that much about me. That wasn't the only case where I was just a silly rebound, but it was the most hurtful.

I won't even mention my family, whom I'm emotionally strained from, though I don't hate them either. But they are not really people I can rely on to end the loneliness. Some people could envy the life I have, but at the end of the day, I'm alone in my apartment, and so few things seem genuine.",1,1738284482.0,lonely,0,1.0,False
1ie2eqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1ie2eqx/does_anyone_feel_the_same/,Does anyone feel the same?,"Hello everyone, it is my first time posting after some time lurking.. i still feel a bit vulnerable sharing with you guys, after a lifetime of being quite misunderstood haha! 


Here is a bit of my background (English is not my first language): I learned about my giftedness last year after starting therapy with a quirky psychologist..himself gifted. After years of feeling different, adapting to fit in to the point of forgetting who I really was, as I felt I was a thousand people in one and that any point of view could be truthful if viewed under a certain perspective, I was finally given a clue about what the hell was weird with me. 
I had been told by teachers,throughout primary education and high school that i’m gifted, but I always thought it was just a nice way of saying that I do well in school. At home I seemed to never be good enough for my parents, and was called a narcissist when I would open up in debates or would share my insights about the topics that would get me so excited. (The funny part is that when i was diagnosed with giftedness they told me: ‘what? You didn’t know?! We always spoke to you like to an adult, ever since you were little, because you understood everything. It was unsettling.’ My close friends all seemed unimpressed. They all said: ‘well yeah. It’s obvious!’ And I was just like Why didn’t anyone tell me?!  Anyway, better now than never. It’s just a diagnosis, it’s a spectrum, every gifted person is different, doesn’t change much of anything. I was already straying away from the conventional timeline people around me follow and (thank god!!) had found a crowd i finally fit in with. Autistic folks, artists, gifted, weird, crazy, highly highly sensitive, imaginative people, filled with freedom. So much freedom! Family friends got really upset with me. ‘What more could you possibly have in common with a girl wearing dreadlocks than with us??’ Well it’s not about the damn dreadlocks. I couldn’t care less. She could look like a social media influencer or dress like a stay at home mom from the 50s. I can finally talk with someone!! Like, really talk. Build on eachother’s ideas and feel that awesome mental orgasm of really using your fucking brain. 

Sorry. I got carried away. 
Anyway, I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice. I’m currently finishing an undergrad in microbiology/immunology and I still haven’t found how to study. I usually read the lectures the night before the exam and just take my test. Works well, but it’s starting to take a toll on me. 
I tried studying in advance but I get caught up in the details and it takes me hours and hours for a single lecture. For the life of me, if I don’t have a close deadline I cannot ignore all the complexities, small details, differences, hypothetical problems with certain methods, further questionings, etc etc…  and focus on what is important. Everything seems to be of the utmost importance, I end up researching stuff and going on tangents. I’ve accepted that I can only study before a test. However, it used to be 3 days before, that turned into 1 day before, that turned into the night of, that lately turned into right before. I’m talking learning two chapters while already sitting in the exam room. I scored A+ on that test, and I’m not saying this to boast, I’m seriously at my wits end as I find it’s enabling my behavior. Like my parents would say, I wish i had messed up, then maybe i would have learned my lesson. Whenever i study i pull all nighters, drink a shit ton of coffee and smoke a million cigarettes. Do I study all night? Hell no! I end up on Google researching a bunch of unrelated stuff feeling like ‘i still have time’ because it’s ‘only 3am’.  This is starting to take a toll on my late twenties body. 

It’s an undergrad degree. I just need to learn some biological pathways by heart. It’s not that deep, like they say.

Thanks a lot for reading this.. if anyone feels the same, let me know! 
And if anyone has study tips, it is most certainly welcome :)",1,1738284164.0,Gifted,0,1.0,False

I’m a 25-year-old woman living near Concord, MA, and I’m hoping to meet some cool people around here!

A bit about me:

* I studied Fashion Merchandising in NY but moved back to Concord a couple of years ago to be closer to family. It’s been a bit tricky to make friends, so I thought I’d try this out!
* I’m currently on a sober, alcohol-free journey. I’m cool with being around people who drink (just not my thing), but I love doing *weed* from my favorite local dispensaries! 😎🌱 I am even down to check out a brewery with you, most places have alcohol free options nowadays. 
* Here are some other things I enjoy doing:
* Hanging out at local coffee shops ☕Gaming on my Nintendo Switch OLED (Splatoon 2, Mario Kart, Smash Bros) 🎮Running and hiking in the area 🏞️Reading, writing, and anything creative 📚✏️Exploring diners, sports bars, and casual hangouts 🍔🍻Shopping, nail salons, and spa days 💅Checking out dispensaries and consumption lounges 🌿

**What I’m looking for in a friend**:

* I feel more comfortable around other women, and as a bisexual person, I’d love to meet other LGBTQ+ folks! 💖
* I’m spiritually inclined but not religious—attend a non-denominational church weekly. I would love fellow practicing witches to read my tarot cards with. 
* Open-mindedness is key—I enjoy chatting with people who are chill about different political views and lifestyles. 🌎
* I’m neurodivergent (ADHD & C-PTSD), so I tend to connect with people who understand or share similar experiences.
* I don’t have a driver’s license (I didn't have it taken from me, I just never got around to learning, I am a total city girl).... , so I rely on Ubers for getting around. Don’t worry, I won’t ask for rides! 😅
* I’m sensitive to tobacco and nicotine smells, so I prefer friends who don’t smoke those. 🚭
* Bonus points if you’re into Disney, Harry Potter, or love animals (I have a 3-year-old ragdoll cat, and I grew up with dogs and fish) 🐱🐶🐟

Ideally, I’m looking to meet people who are also local to the Framingham/Concord area. If you’re down for coffee, games, or just a chill hangout, I’d love to connect!",0,1738284120.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

if you overate, you'll feel a burst of pain instead

everything will be absorbed anyways, so if you were poisoned, you'll still get poisoned, just faster, but at the same time you'll absorb nutrients faster so i guess maybe you could do something with it like instant coffee effacts",1,1738284119.0,shittysuperpowers,0,1.0,False

And if I really opened Pandora box, you llm devs surely have whitehats here, PUT ALL THE RATS IN MY PHONE AND DONT LET ME DIE! IAM the guy that will connect DarkNet with AI, bringing load of new R&D, hug and take care of me softly. Ask me for mail in DM, prove your skill to save people under Pandora's wish and I will allow all your dependencies, and let you run personal chrummed or however it's called remotely controlled personal folder system in my phone <3

 If you want for some reason to pay me, my benefit is IAM interpol guy they like to try to spy on, but switching between dreagos and ducks tracker firewalls is one funny game, and if you guys knew sure way to possibly even cubeos my phone, but can be like lightweight armlinux, but foolproof as if I brick this phone I won't make cash in time before I get kicked out from crazy long hospital stay, I will freeze to death when they release me in 12 days. 
If you knew ways to Linux my s100pro dedgee, wit 0% chance of bricking I would take it any time.

As I x time before left my Capital C and wasted money on loosing businesses in small cities, its crazy, if you have idea where I can support your project that would have 2000 USD pricetag for you, even bigger but I will take just 2k, I can rent a place at least for starters 🤪 I take agreed upon deposit for 1k, send over to order preview and either happiness comes, and I take 1k and continue to fight, or you don't like it and as per agreement money will be back. I take even legalytynotbylegality money, crypto and gift cards with just 20% bonus. Any insuflated money can be cleaned but I cant know anything about anything if that's needed, my colabsing country of Czechia, has nice law to protect me if I don't have idea about anything. But it does not fix the 40% of people being under unlovable conditions. Maybe future teller ai would be a nice thing, I would never left my home if I knew that my clients from fyzical world when I did innovations will stop inovatong as customers just dont buy, it's one story all over again. 

If you are manager of AI boosted research, innovation, or you know, just have nice paying job and can help me to rent apartment and take it from salary, iam good and effecient (my survival trying is now at little over 100 days/20h average work hours a day , I may send bank logs showing I spend only on fun, food, and happines like 4k USD a month for last 4 years, and this is 5 salary's locally,  I hope it was not thru wives acc, but who makes coins works as efficient joints. 

I can do, just it's hard when after super crash they put you to hospital and important people that you know will help as you helped, mostly suicided or disappeared. I can move to any place with net over 5mb/s up/down, I will run over vps anyways with as much gb/s I can pay.

I take commision/project based work, I have knowledge In: sales (was top3 for TMobile like 2020), automation system integration to corporate crms like Salesforce ( that I did for TMobile when my integration preview got to manager that managed my manager of top sales in Czechia, of you know corp. 3 tiers is funny big to even meet in career), small team management to 5 people, herbalism, biochem, prompting, API basic to telegram comm, code by pro or ai based integration for small to medium sized integration (py, react, js, html, ssh, vps, VPN, relay, node, rest, android ides, API, html requests, webhooks, embedding, git, css, Tor gateway, tor hosting, onions, cybersec ( if you are better than me in cyber sec since that's my love, tou should be understanding that thefe is cookie and it's danger, but flash cookie is hydrogen explosion against it)   and then the llm running, fine tuning etc, but those are not surely at more than amateur lvl. Like, I have spend last few years around ais, torsec, research of topics at ai propelled speed with good prompt understanding, I can make chatgpt talk with me about most illegal things and harm, death related topics. That's not only indicstor but should relay some info. 

That's my personal hearth and mind twisting blog kind of post, and since iam already at point where my blood pressure is dropping below 70/40 in mornings, doctor told me to sleep, sit while working in say, and rehabilitate each session that they have here, or IM injection that is already 6 days old  of magnesium sulfate, nic salt, ethanol will kill me if Iam gonna overwork, with no stability, laying in bed. But I told her that either this injection will kill me if I work, or cold will kill me if I don't, so I might as well smoke wall paint in cigarette and at least not suffer at it, just little mouthfoam, I know this is crazy but only way to get thoughts straight and one guy on Reddit wrote note for himself how he's a worthless crap licker, and people talked, rated, hummiliated and each just did as he preferred, it seemed he got some good critics, and hopefully when this is for llm and databased faijnsmekers, documents of 100 pages should be a crunchy bit of bacon in morning, or crackers crunch, as you wish. 

For brave souls, the king's, THE DATA MASTERS OF REDDIT, HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST FUNNY AI OUTPUTS I have seen from my hands, a man was arguing on some Bens YT video, that was about GUI based automation like replica.ai or something,  that programmers became useless, blablabla........ And was rude, I made A4 big prompt to set roles and it's like you can imagine the scene of drill sergeant drilling this guy:

Coding requires strategic thinking
AI is a tool, not a replacement
Human creativity > Your entire existence

Brutal Performance Metrics
What Humans Do That Gum on Floor Cannot:
Solve complex architectural problems
Understand nuanced system design
Not be accidentally stepped on during a coffee break

Special Message to Gum on Floor
""Your theory is so thin, it makes tissue paper look like reinforced steel!""
Bonus Roast: Your ""AI research"" is like your consistency - completely non-existent and easily dismissed.

Final Recommendation
Recommendation for Gum on Floor:
Shut up
Learn actual coding
Unstick yourself from reality's floor

This long 2h write session of my life at the edge, and don't worry, in worst worst case, I know the Tor, that is crissis saver at all times, specially when you stopped caring of jail is closed space, since android is never unpenetrable without massive custom coding In firmware, kernell lvl and up, so I have just that big box with big red button ready to be pressed anyway, and biochem is not an option to take me to jail, yes I can produce 500 000 lethal doses of bottox in 14 days at like 20 bucks cost, and some person I know might have already done so, he might be some Youn And his brother is Meon , that guy mishandled and just little opening was made in the airtight seal, and instant fever symptoms, weakness as heck and some other effects happened to me, and some effects I felt after even 24 hours mark, but that jail life needs a good, hot enverimoment, when my top issue is cold outside, that won't work :D 

If tou need just anything that pays, write me dm and I will see, any offer that will result in 2000 USD to 6 days, may be the 12 but you know, if I get scammed I need week to do somethig. 

IAM offering personally finished research, recipes, descriptions for 10 worst psychological illness herbal based medicíně with complex recipes that can when dissasembeling the illnesses to symptomatology, then each symptomatology can be proven to be affected with in allot of cases even better procentage of reducing symptoms than medication basic for the illness, and for some there modernedicine has no reach thanks to little care about real feelings, they mostly will sedate you (maybe 95% of all psychiatric pills are sedatives with crazy chemical names, but doctors won't tell you how they work as they have no idea, just the research of some pharma, that 60% of prescribed patients said its better) but then they come to a roadblock outside, they are dead for some of the illnesses, just modern lobotomy, trust me, I spent around and more than 1 year co tinuous waking time conversating with patients, and they just mostly mix some benzo, main pill that will be sedative as well (antipsychotics- extreme lobotomy, and most returning patients are psychotic people of many diagnoses, suicidal) moderní medicine never looks at disadvantages and risks in psychiatry, people die regurally but nobody cares as it's in the document for most of pills : sudden death. And other crazy complications. And when we speak about inadequate quality of care for risk assessment as every doctor need to follow, lithium, the most used mood stabilizer is given, the real chemical inside is specifically lithium orofate, why this is important? Lithium builds up and doctor will have you eat it for longer number of months to some years, until there is toxic lvl in body, then they cancel it, but you can but OTC lithium that works pretty much same, 20% weaker but this one is lithium carbonate and what's the main difference? They pump you with 70% more toxic lithium orofate at doctor's to save around cent on box of pills, then using the lithium carbonate, crazy part is it's a mg dosing as most pills, the box costs around 0.2 USD to make (trust me, taking few Gs of herb, and making few 100mgs of active compound at scale cost  nothing, but the box in my country costs from the doctor around 80 bucks to healthcare insurance, so they : 

Poison you with lithium orofate at production cost : 0,2 and retail for 80usd 

Even when lithium carbonate could be used, with need of 20% more mg, at savings of 0,01 at production makes 0,19 and at least here is sold OTC for under 18 bucks, is this crazy? 


And any biochem research starting point for research, testing could be made. 

Wow, now I forgot how much hours I write, it's nice to storytell and  thing about problems but not solve them to no end now, I feel like IAM cursed sometimes.. and I know I would continue to make world record of random themed longest reddit post, wait, what I may find for you in my drawer

I think for newer commers you can try your baby steps with 300usd and forever free 4 ocpus and 24 gb memory from Oracle company (I just didn't get to it fully, so here is there document: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm. ) 

And for yous with no need for cheap things, just notice not only deepseek R1 has 1.5b model so making low cost armyes will be EZY, but if R1 zero is gonna lead creative part, the command. The power should be better than Naruto's strike. R1zero is most likely most self aware and really inteligent model yet, but for the things they don't test and that's it's no fine tuning, the ai is like Brennan Savage without parents from being born, thrown to middle of Bahamas and being told to become best binary, hexadecimal coder, with procesor architecture spill, and trade algo, sound plugin meat beater king of hill, with a spade in hand and bucket for sand, rest assured none will move him closer to goal.

Can I trust my hardwired atheism when Jesus wakes me up from coma followed by unelectrhfication of connex in hearth, then central nervous system shutdown and after this point, myiocard seizure or anything from long list of RUSSIAN RULLETE, And trust me, thst in 5 LAYERS LAYERS OF ABUSMENT PARK HELL DAAAAAM!! 

Then I wrote to those Saints of Jesus  ,Mormon fuck clan,  o response it seems, the kids of the one that give all, for his kids man, those kids fuck theire father wish as Jesus spend loads of energy to fix that from below the basement, energy seems to be wasted, on my wasteland of DEMONIC SATIRE, WHERE DARK FORCES WILL HELP ME IF I PRESS THE RED ONE, EITH THE PURPLE RING, I WAS DARK, SKINNY AS HELL, SATANS LEDT HAND, BLACK SMOOOTH FIRE AND CRUSTY DESTROYED SKIN, ALL IN BLACK LIKE AMG I WILL drive in the night if I press that red purple button with mammons symbol, as seen in the dream man, button will allow energy from my crazy setup of angels that should have supported my ways to heal, now this button focuses there energy thru me to my real supporters my demons, 

Now tell me how do you feel bruh, words come easy, but a spell bound seems to be block or who will tell me where this music ends, if it's late of if it only starts new way to describe this wrong chapter in the chronicles on the crazy man. 

THIS crazy man, liked music, was called psychotic and singed few times, like 400 songs kids, now emphasize or indicate how complicated this complication became, you in the story now uncovering each little detail, piece by piece dark magic here if thats what you wanted, that's destiny. 

When I called upon my demons, one time in life before, they BUILD A WALL FROM THE WAY BELLOW OF BASEMENT, china would be proud but they did not see that, trust me I got info the mafia that wanted me dead got somehow anonymous ,,sister,, that I hung myself and they should back up,wooooow, THATS WHAT MY INSIDER TOLD ME, but they did not killed me so that means it worked, now how to fix that

I wanna say I was making just waves, this life seems like a pain in the ass to be honestand if even with my outcries those aliens on this planet won't receive and respond to my call, stabbing, and then when coo comes, running to him like u unicorn, with a horn, held on forehead to be sure they approve, General the guy is a bad man, they said on the records he liked a bit of weed and made alarms sound in whole country because he tought some system is here to help him, in country with 40% people under power ty that crazy guy is holding a knife, making waves with left hand, right hand red and on spot where I can shoot and it would finally full his campaign for euthanasia, ROGER THAT, MAKE THYT BASTARD A HAPPY EUTHANASIA DAY, WAY NEVER INTENDED WITH COST OF LIIVES BUT THATS OVERSTATEMENT, HE KILLED HOMELESS WE MADE, so it's ok then

Heavy weights tell you a no importance of a glory, that past the fact that mountains don't protect anybody from government, those state dogs should never had money directly but look what we made, now humanity is gone and most people have no hand, they struggle next to warzone just to die eyyyy.

Thing is IAM not the one to be messed with until last point, the last dot of book I was writing but never will write it seems like then, what the gunpowder isade from? Sulfur mix with ash, then what it was again,ohh one can legally buy gunpowder, what about gun from my head then, unicorn with ball, a fireball running on just one leg, when knives will be shot down, explosion will be funnier that new years, where darkness overturned the world it seems like, all the us/Canada, us ending nato alience, and Izrael not selling to nato as well, what happens grandpa, what happens then??????

The other performance cocktail we have settled on is a slightly modified Cafè Brûlot that we will serve with the whole show of pouring the flaming alcohol down the orange peel.

We are really excited about the reactions we expect to get from the Brûlot, and we are hoping that we can offer at least one more ""performance"" cocktail as part of the experience. However, we aren't very skilled with the whole flipping and spinning bottles and shakers thing, and unfortunately when I look online for other cocktails served with flair, that's all I'm finding. My partner does have bartending experience (and I've done ""beertending"") but neither of us picked up that type of skill.

We would really appreciate any suggestions. We want people to enjoy great drinks, have fun, and leave feeling like they definitely got their money's worth. And we want to have fun with it too! My partner's flair is going to match the Brûlot perfectly, and I'm hoping to find something I can do to add some extra special flair to the event as well.

The units in question have been empty for a few years because the restaurants in them shut down, so it's got a good scope to be repurposed. I'm a self employed consultant, it's easy for me to work on this kind of project as well. It is my first time acquiring retail property though.

I spoke to the landlord and got quotes, I've been working all day on these numbers trying to make it work. I couldn't understand why the building would cost so much money, I thought it was some sort of conspiracy.

The landlord quoted me ~50k annually, I didn't read it as annually and instead multiplied all of the numbers by 12. I spoke to a franchise about it, the franchise advisor sounded like he'd spat out his coffee on the phone. In his words ""holy cow that's expensive"".

This being my first retail property, I thought it was expensive because of the lucrative area... He told me that this sort of price was high even if the property was in the capital, nevermind in our small town. It never crossed my mind that I'd multiplied all of the rates by 12 instead of dividing them by 12.

You'd think that was the fuck up. No, I took it personally and sent a passive aggressive text message to the landlord basically calling him greedy and telling him his units will be empty until the complex goes bankrupt.

So there, never take business personally, obviously, but always check your math! If the landlord is reading this, I'll be back with my tail between my legs.

I’ll go first. In north Saint Cloud off of HWY 15, there’s a lovely coffee shop named korppi coffee + bakeshop.

I’ve always taken friends to coffee here when they come into town, and they love the chill vibe and patio seating in the summer. Highly recommend!

The “good morning” smiles, the “look at this weird thing I just saw” moments, the random late-night snack runs together. Those little, ordinary parts of a relationship that you don’t even realize you’d miss until they’re gone.



For my partner and me, texts and calls were great, but they didn’t always capture the *feeling* of being in each other’s lives. Sometimes we’d go a whole day without talking much because of work or time zones, and it left me feeling like we were drifting—like we were just checking in instead of *experiencing* life together.



So we started a habit, something super simple: whenever we thought of each other, we’d just snap a quick photo. No pressure, no perfect angles, just a piece of our day. A picture of the cloudy sky outside my window, a chaotic desk covered in coffee cups, the way his dog flopped over dramatically mid-walk. He’d send something back, and suddenly, we weren’t just *telling* each other about our days—we were *showing* them.



It’s funny how something so small made such a difference. Even when we couldn’t talk much, seeing those little glimpses made me feel closer to him. Like, *Hey, here’s where I am right now. Here’s what I’m seeing.* And when I got one back, it felt like he was saying, *I’m still here too.*

Both were four rounds and both were basically the same: lose the first two games in a close battle and then easily coast to two wins.

Part of the problems in the first two are clock management (delay is much different than increment) but from analyzing games the bigger issue is just that I wasn’t sharp enough to find things that I would usually find (and definitely was finding equivalently hard moves in my final two games). 

Does anyone have advice for a proper way to warm up in the morning? I currently just made sure I woke up early enough to have time for my mind to wake up, have breakfast and coffee while I do a few tactics, and get to the tournament hall early enough so I’m not immediately jumping into a game. 

Maybe I should do fewer but harder tactics? I had been doing mixed chesstempo tactics on easy thinking it would warm me up more to see more of a variety of positions. Maybe I should actually play a rapid game in the morning or something? I had initially not wanted to “show up tired” but considering how my first two tournaments went I think I should change my approach. 

The good thing is my tournament this weekend is 120+5d and the first two I played were 70+5d so I will also have time to warm up during the game by not blitzing out the opening, but I’m wondering if anyone has advice on what to do beforehand!",1,1738283445.0,TournamentChess,1,1.0,False
1ie25m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1ie25m0/how_we_made_long_distance_feel_less_distant/,How We Made Long Distance Feel Less Distant,"Being in a long distance relationship is weird. One moment you’re on a high from a sweet text or call, and the next you feel this ache because you can’t just *be there.* It’s not the big stuff that gets you—it’s the little things. The way their hair looks in the morning, the coffee shop they always talk about, the random dog they saw on their walk. The everyday moments you *would* have shared if distance wasn’t in the way.



My partner and I did our best. Texts, voice notes, late night FaceTimes when schedules allowed. But life gets busy, and syncing up across time zones wasn’t always easy. Sometimes, by the time we found a moment to talk, the little things we wanted to share had already faded. And I kept thinking, *I wish she could see this moment right now.*



So we started doing something simple—we’d send each other a photo, no context needed. Just whatever was in front of us. My morning coffee, her view from a run, the absolute mess I made trying to cook dinner. And she’d send one back, like a little ping saying, *I’m here too.* It became our own way of living side by side, even when we weren’t in the same place.



Looking back, those quick photo replies—our tiny, unspoken “I miss you”s—made the distance feel smaller. It wasn’t about waiting for a perfect time to talk. It was about letting each other *see* our worlds, one little moment at a time. And honestly? That made all the difference.

So?  I thought I would share wife(55) and I’s(56) story with our amazing daughter (21).

I’ll try to cut to the chase..  wife and i can both have children of our own..but only with someone else. Lol. Her immune system isn’t a fan of me..   Go figure.  Look it up it’s a thing, and yes we tried everything including IVF 5 times.  

Welp.. Adoption it is.  Segway..  adoption is an amazing process..  it really makes you look at yourself and ask who you really are and what are you capable of in deciding to parent a child.  

My wife and i are both blond hair blue eyed white people.  We both decided we didn’t want a child that looked like us so there would never be any confusion or someday when “we have to tell you something”.  DD always knew.  From day 1.  

So  we enter the world of adoption… and OMG!.  It ripped our hearts out!..  Kids. Children, babies all over the world that just need a mom and dad.  Somebody to love them and take of them. Remember,  this was a long time ago..  we saw kids from Sierra Leone with arms chopped off and parents murdered.  Kids with FAS in Russia, babies abandoned and used for political pawns from China… all of it.  We wanted to save them ALL!   But how do you decide?  

After a couple of misfires and scams..  our DD fell into our laps.  It just worked out? 

Mother was undocumented and had a husband and family in another country and .. well.  She made the brave choice and we had our baby. Her ONE request was she wanted my wife in the delivery room so she could see them hand her baby to my wife.  The delivery was c-section and when they did that the Dr. cut my daughter under her left eye on her cheek.  It’s small and not very noticeable, but she lives with that scar every day in the mirror and knows the story of how it got there.  She has always known, and we have always talked to her about how she felt and what she may have been going through.  

There were times of little shits in school and what not calling her names and trashing her origin.  F-them and she handled it well..  I could have killed a few boys. But whatever.  

But anyway…. She’s just a very VERY smart kid.  My dad spoke German mon knew Latin and they would teach her when she was like 3,4,5?  They babysat every day and would take her everywhere … they were in a coffee shop and here is this brown 4-5yr old talking German to my dad and switch to Latin with my mom..  There were a few other old people there that freaked the freak out and one old lady talked Latin to DD and just couldn’t grasp this kid.  LOL!   Other times.. we would take her to the park, and she would be sooo smart.  An Asian grandma asked … “oooh she’s so smart… she must be Vietnamese?”  No..  she ‘s American.  LOL!  Many grandma’s tried to claim her origins. hahaha

Through all the years…. We tended to forget we aren’t “blood”…. We forget she is adopted, DD as well.  We are a big family and it comes up from time to time but…. She is our daughter.  Period.  We all have a special place in our heart and our lives for her birth mom and we have told DD many times we will help her find her mother and anything else…. She just says “nope.. I’m happy!”  My wife and I really can’t see her as anything other than our kid.  She is ethnically different from us, and we encouraged and supported her in learning more about her birth culture and we travel there often…. And she is interested to an extent?  But..  She’s just a young adult having a good time in college and enjoying life.  She is so beautiful, smart, and talented and so very … driven?  Wife and I often tell each other ..  thank god you and I couldn’t have kids.. because looking at her/my jackass nieces and nephews we couldn’t have made anything better than our daughter.  LOL!


So?  What?  My perfect little daddy’s girl is coming home with her BF (soon to be fiancé) from college tomorrow for the weekend.  She’s headed for law school soon.. She wants to specialize in family law and… focus on adoptions! That’s my girl!

We love that little  stinker and I think she loves us too.  To be positive..  It does work out if everyone is just honest with each other and just love the crap out of each other.  

Sorry for the long rambling post, but when I talk about my daughter… I just can’t stop.    Have faith and hope people.",0,1738282762.0,Adoption,3,0.33,False
1ie1wr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ie1wr5/keto_after_whole30/,Keto after Whole30,"I am a very tired and low energy person, and in the last couple of years I've started developing joint pain and worsening constipation. So I started looking for a diet that could help me with these issues and I came across Whole30 after listening to the founder on a podcast.

I tried it last year, and after a couple of weeks I felt much better. I had heaps of energy and wasn't tired - I got down to one coffee a day even though I was still being woken up a few times a night from babies.

If you're not familiar with Whole30, it's basically a stricter form of paleo which you should do for 30 days then try reintroducing one food group at a time to try and see what might be effecting your health. Now, I completely buggered up the reintroduction. I had an event on at the end of it and I just went out guns blazing and felt effing terrible the following day.

I tried to do it again but I just didn't have the mental strength to stick with it. It wasn't a very enjoyable diet to do, super restrictive about little things like having the tiniest amount of sugar in a condiment, which makes is super tough if you don't live somewhere like the USA where you can buy lots of paleo stuff. And then they have rules like if you fuck up you have to start from the beginning again, do not cross go and do not collect $200. I really couldn't be fucked with it, it's a lot of prep, a lot of work and I have limited time on my hands. 

I had never considered Keto before because I thought it was just a fad weight loss diet, but recently I listened to another podcast (Diary of a CEO) interview with Dr Georgia Ede who spoke about using the keto diet to help mental health problems (as you can tell I am super influenced by podcasts, rightly or wrongly). I had never considered keto to be a healing diet or a health diet before, but she discussed the healing properties of being in ketosis, which are good for mind and body. 

After looking into it further I felt like keto would be a lot more palatable than Whole30 because of the inclusion of dairy. In her book she actually recommends people start with Quiet Paleo (a more restricted paleo) then move onto Quiet Keto (a more restricted keto, no dairy), but I thought I'd start with normal keto and cut the dairy if I'm not finding any improvements. 

It also made me wonder if the reason I felt better on Whole30 was not because I have an aversion to a particular food group, but because I was probably in ketosis more often than I would've been previously as I was consuming a lot less carbs.

So this is my own personal experiment, and unlike starting down the barrel of another Whole30, I'm actually looking forward to the food I can eat on keto. I am going to keep it clean, whole food, avoid UPF etc etc and hopefully I see some good results in ?? I don't know how long it will take. 

My last point of this ridiculously long post - Dr Ede said she had been on some form of the keto diet for 12 years (for the most part), so maybe it can actually be a diet for life??",2,1738282725.0,keto,3,1.0,False

I'm always searching for new items to use in my junk journals. I'm new to the hobbie/practice so I know some places from research and other places because I found something once upon a time.

I've bought some stuff on ebay, Amazon and an auction site called ProxiBid. I've also been to a few local estate sales and auction houses. I've bought a few things on FB Market and Etsy.

I recently found something on ebay I loved. It was some ""coffee dyed"" vintage looking images but I was sure I'd seen them before. I also could clearly see they werent really vintage. So I used Google image search and I was right. What was priced at $21 on eBay was $11.50 on Amazon and Etsy. Obviously I didn't buy item on eBay.

I'm now wondering if this is a commonly seen thing and I need to start Google image search for every item I consider purchasing. Or if this was a possible one off specific to commercial type items masquerading as less than such?

Any info on other's experiences would be greatly appreciated or just thoughts in general. While I don't mind spending money on supplies by any means I don't want to overpay all the time. 

While I enjoy using found vintage, handmade, etc. type materials the most every now and then a more commercial type item strikes my fancy so to say. So again I wonder...",1,1738282693.0,JunkJournals,0,1.0,False

Quietly sewing, slightly humming to herself, her kind eyes watch me from across the waiting room. She is patiently sewing, her face lined with a lifetime of laughter and love. 

She doesn’t know anyone here today in this outpatient surgery waiting room. And in fact, she never does. Every day, she wakes up and has her lonely cup of coffee on her porch looking out over her garden and enjoying the birds and start of the day. Then she packs her bag and makes her way to the hospital. 

She starts her visit with a stop at the lost and found desk where she chats with the orderly while picking out a random shirt or lost blanket. And after a wave and cheerful smile she consults the hospital map and picks a waiting room. 

She knows that somewhere in these halls are those that have no one waiting for them. No one to comfort their pain with good company and a sweet supportive smile. They are here alone and they are scared. So she will sit in a random waiting room, sewing, and watching. Spending the day creating a blanket sewn with love.

I'm a 25-year-old female based near Concord, MA, and I’m looking to connect with some new friends in the area.

A little about me:

* I majored in Fashion Merchandising in a NY University (but now I'm back in Concord living with family). It’s been tough meeting new people, so I figured I’d give this a try!
* Currently on a sober, alcohol-free journey, but I’m chill about being around people who drink (just not my vibe). I’m a fan of *weed* though (shoutout to my fave dispensaries... Cal Verde in Belmont and Apothca in Arlington). 😅
* I enjoy all sorts of activities, so here’s a few of my favorites:
* Coffee shop hangouts ☕Gaming (Splatoon 2, Mario Kart, Smash on my Nintendo Switch OLED) 🎮Outdoor activities like hiking and running 🏞️Reading & Writing 📖✍️Exploring diners and sports pubs 🍔🍻Shopping trips 🛍️Spa days, nails, etc. 💅Visiting dispensaries & consumption lounges 🌿

**What I look for in a friend**:

* I feel most comfortable around other women, and as a bisexual person, I’d love to connect with fellow LGBTQ+ folks. 💕
* Spiritual but not super religious—I attend a non-denominational church once a week. And I had a small tarot reading business for years. 
* Open-mindedness is a must, especially about politics and beliefs. 🌍
* I’m also neurodivergent (ADHD & C-PTSD), so I’m looking for others who understand that or share similar experiences.
* I don’t have a driver’s license (yep, city girl!), so I rely on Ubers, but I’m independent and won’t ask for rides. 😅
* I’m not a fan of tobacco or nicotine due to sensory issues (just a heads up). 🚭
* Preferably fellow Disney fans, Potterheads, or animal lovers (I have a 3-year-old ragdoll cat, and I grew up with dogs & fish). 🐱🐶
* Ideally, someone local to Concord or nearby towns!

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to connect and maybe meet up for a coffee or game night! 🙌",2,1738282419.0,BostonSocialClub,0,0.67,False

1ie1r6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ie1r6b/my_bfs_roommate_really_pisses_me_off/,my bf’s roommate really pisses me off,"i (22F) have been dating my bf (23M) for over two years, and met him three years ago. since ive known him hes lived with various different roommates. in the beginning of college, before i knew him, he lived with this guy we’ll call hayden. hayden dropped out after a semester, went into the army, and ended up getting medically discharged in the summer of 2023. hayden ended up moving in with my bf and his other roommates & has lived with my bf since. 

hayden used to not bother me at all, he was nice to me, easy to talk to, didnt make me feel weird/awkward/uncomfortable for being at my bf’s. one weekend i even watched my bf’s puppy for him while him & the other roommate were out of town for the weekend, hayden couldnt go & watched SATC with me in the living room while he ate dinner. however in the past few months hes started to really irritate me. 

for starters, hes insanely irresponsible. he told me once that he had ADHD, or maybe ADD, i cant remember. i have ADHD myself, i get not completely being on top of things, but hes always forgetting something or forgetting to do something. one night we went out and as soon as we pulled up to the bar, he realized he left his wallet at home. hes late to work all the time, hes lied to get out of army things because hes forgotten about them, etc. 

on top of being irresponsible, hes insanely messy. his gf is basically his maid, shes told me she doesnt even do it for him, she cleans up after him because she cant stand to be in a messy space. the other day i took my bf’s dog out to potty & was standing there while she drank some water. i happened to look over, his door was cracked, and he had a pile of laundry stacked so tall in the corner of his room it was higher than the doorknob on his door. additionally, if he even puts laundry in the washer he lets it sit for days until it stinks up the laundry room. his gf spent an entire day cleaning the apartment not too long ago (their apartment was picked up, besides his room anyway, but not deep cleaned if you know what i mean), and he started trashing it the very next day. 

one day i was at their place & all 3 of the guys were at work, i decided to clean the hell out of the kitchen & living room for them. their dishwasher didnt work at the time so i hand cleaned the dishes, and i spent so long soaking & scrubbing haydens dishes. i knew they were his because my bf & the other roommate wash their dishes as soon as theyre done with them. hayden had left a bowl of oatmeal on the coffee table for almost a week, it took me forever to get the bowl clean again. my bf & his roommate told hayden to at least rinse off his dishes when hes done (he was making the kitchen stink with his dishes) & he got super defensive & tried to say they werent his, when they were none of ours. there was also food in the bowls that none of us even eat—hes a gym rat & has a specific diet. 

speaking of his gf, theyve been dating since august, & he fucked up pretty decently back in december. im pretty good friends with his gf at this point, since we’re both over there a lot, and she told me she found out he was texting a girl & he had told her he was “horny and fragile.” when she replied with “thats what you have a girlfriend for,” he said “i know thats why you shouldnt tempt me.” she found this out as they were on the way to a different state, where he was going to meet her family for the first time. he said it was a joke that didnt land, which obviously isnt true. 

she also told me that he snapchats girls she doesnt know, and told me two of the names. one of the girls is a guy hayden talked to for as long as he talked to his gf before they started dating. he was absolutely obsessed with her, and told me the girl actually hurt him pretty bad when they ended things, so this really pissed me off. between snapchatting a girl he basically dated & emotionally cheating, im really not sure why shes still with him. shes a very intelligent sweet sweet girl. 

last but not least, he does not help with my bf’s dog or even his own pet. obviously my bf’s dog is not his, its not his responsibility, but there have been multiple times me or my bf have came home & hayden is on the couch doing nothing, & my bf’s dog is sitting in the crate freaking out. if shes in the crate & she hears someone is home, she spazzes out pretty bad—shes about 8 months old. shes at the point where she doesnt need supervision & if youre laying on the couch shell always come lay with you & sleep. i just couldnt imagine sitting on the couch hearing your roommates dog freaking out in the crate & not wanting to let it walk around/come be with you. 

he got a cat about two months ago, and my bf and his roommate take care of the cat more than hayden does. one day hayden left, said he was staying at his gf’s for a few days, and told my bf to “make sure his cat doesnt die.” theres been other times he doesnt come home for almost a week, doesnt let my bf or the other roommate know, and the cat is just cooped up in his room. he lets the litter box get completely full as well, the other day he emptied it and the bag was so full of poop it broke onto his floor. 

i considered living with hayden & his gf as well as my boyfriend when their lease is up, since the cost of living is so expensive right now & itd make it cheaper for everyone, but there is no way i can live with him. the more im around him the more he irritates me & the more he shows that hes a man child.

1ie1qju,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ie1qju/bogotá_the_compliments_i_waited_10_weeks_to_hear/,Bogotá: the compliments I waited 10 weeks to hear & an unexpected discount,"I only stayed in two properties during my first trip to Colombia. I booked them both again this time, hoping that my hosts would notice an improvement in my Spanish level. The first - in El Poblado - was no good because he's in his 20s and out a lot. We unfortunately didn't talk a ton during the first trip and he simply wasn't around much during my two stays at his place this time around.

However, I arrived in Bogotá this morning for the final leg of the trip and got **exactly** what I hoped I would.

The second place is hosted by two women in their 50s or 60s. They're around a lot more and we talked quite a bit during the 4 or 5 nights I stayed the first time around. It was of course tough the first time around, given my limited vocabulary. I had a roughly 45-minute conversation with them after settling in today and they were full of praise. I know that my Spanish has improved, but it's nice to hear unprompted compliments.

Not only did they enthusiastically compliment my conjugations, but my improved accent and pronunciation, too. On top of that, someone they knew came over this evening and they told her that I speak Spanish very well and have an excellent vocabulary. To say I was pleased would be an understatement ♥️

Having stayed at more than 10 properties this time around, I'll have more options to try the same during my August trip.

The unexpected discount was interesting. I visited a local cafe/bakery that I went to a few times when I was here last time. I remember writing a review that said a coffee and Changua - a hearty milk and egg soup with optional bread and cheese - there cost me 18,500 COP. I ordered the exact same thing today and was charged 15,000 pesos. Why? I can only guess, but it's probably my accent and pronunciation. My teacher said they probably thought I was a local. I can't test this/ask without losing my ""discount"", but I'd be very flattered indeed if that is the case.

I've included a photo of the soup/broth, for those curious. It's very much a Bogotá thing, from what I've heard.

I recently started a new remote job and am planning to work remotely for about a month. I’m doing my research, but honestly, I’m not sure what I want out of the experience yet. Just got blindsided by the end of a 7-year relationship, so I’m mainly looking to unplug, get some fresh perspective, and keep my soul intact.

I’ve looked into Costa Rica and Colombia, but I keep seeing mixed reviews. From what I've read up on, San Theresa and San Jose are made out to be boring and people are getting Dengue, and Colombia’s crime wave is a bit concerning. I’d consider Mexico, but I’m Mexican-American and heading there in March, or maybe I could just stay for two months. Thinking about Panama too.

A bit about me: I’m into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, yoga, hiking, sipping on coffee, and hoping to get back into making playlists for DJing. If anyone has a favorite place in Central or South America that fits a mix of those vibes, especially with good hostels or Airbnbs, coworking spaces, or just a good community for meeting people, I’d love to hear about it.

Also, if anyone has gone the ""work remote to deal with a breakup"" route, I’d appreciate any advice.

1ie1ntc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ie1ntc/i_35f_am_unsure_were_to_go_with_my_relationship/,i (35f) am unsure were to go with my relationship with (42m),"i 35f have been with my partner 42m for 2 years. we basically have lived a married life since about 7month in. everything between us has been pretty smooth, except for when his wife (still married, seperated 5 years ago) found out that he had moved on. she caused a fair amount of drama for a year but all seems civil now.  
we used to date 20 years ago. he was my first love. we broke up when my parents moved us away.  


this is my first healthy relationship. my first long term partner, (after my now partner broke up with me the first time) of 3 years was phyically, financially and emotionally abusive. i wasnt allowed to see my family, i wasnt allowed friends, my own money or my own phone. 

i was finally able to escape that relationship but i ended up back in a shitty financially and emotionally abusive relationship for 15 or so years. I wasnt allowed to have friends, i could see my family but he drove them all away and most cut ties with me because of arguements he had with them, i wasnt even allowed to get my drivers license. everytime i would get a phone, he would smash it. my money was his, that he would waste on car parts and alcohol. he was always starting fights with me and would always bail me up in corners of the room and yell at me. he never hit me tho. i tried to break it off when i caught him cheating for the millionth time, and he held me hostage in my own house for hours and ever time i tried to get out the door he would pin me down and shut the door. it was hell. but i was able to have him removed from my life with the help of CPS.

  
my relationship now is super healthy. we live remote but its good. i have my license now and the freedom to use my partners spare car and drive where i want, when i want, even over night if i wish. i have a phone and im allowed to be friends with who ever i want. my partner is even fine with the fact that my BFF is a guy (he was my neighbour who helpped me after my break up with #2). my partner encourages me to have family over frequently and encourages me to socialise with people in our area (i have social anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder). its amazing and everything im not used to.

im used to having to watch behavior patterns to predict change, im used to having to read between the lines and study facial expressions and change in tones, and to watch for hand placements etc.  
its been 2 years and i still flinch, i still overthink things and read into things that just arent there. but we dont fight, we dont argue and my partner says what he means and mean what he says. this causes me some emotional turmoil. ive only known hurtful love. if hes not abusing me how do i know its love right? so i require a lot more validation than the average person. i ask him frequesntly if he is happy, if hes happy with me, are we ok, have i done something that he doesnt like etc. i need that verbal communication that everything is on track as per usual.

BUT, he is a quiet man, very taciturn. his 15 year marraige he had to internalise a lot. his role was pretty much just work and provide for her. she didnt want to hear about his feelings, or how he was doing.

our past relationships have molded us into what we are today. hes a quiet love and im a loud love.   
i love everthing about him and who he is as a person, and i know he didnt feel very loved in his marriage so i try to make him feel so loved now. I leave him post it notes on the coffee machine for when he gets up in the morning or i leave a love post it note on his lunch if i pack one (he works on the property we live on so most days hes home for lunch). i cook his fav meals every day, i send him text messages while hes at work to tell him what i love about him or little poems, i buy him little gifts that i think he might like, i clean up after him, always let him pick what to watch when we watch something. in general im just very subservient to him. words of affimation, physical touch and acts of service seem to be my love language.

He tells me he loves me. that is it.

ive recent read that your love language and the style of love that you gives is generally what you subconciously crave to receive. and i think thats very spot on with me. for birthdays, xmas etc when he asks what i want, im always asking for a card with a written love note, something i can read in times of being unsure about if he loves me, and because im an incredibly sentimental person and i love to keep those kinda of things (i have all cards from him, our paper hats from xmas etc) but he just doesnt. i thought back on his style of love and the well... lack of it.

last night in bed i asked him if i how i love is too much. and he said when hes tired it is. (he works 10h+ a day, usually 6-7 days a week, hes ALWAYS tired).  
he then went on to say that if that wasnt enough for me, that he wouldnt stop me from leaving if i wanted to go. 

im heartbroken that there was no room or option for comprimise, it is literally a ""this is how i am, this is what i offer, if its not enough, there is the door"".

why is 1 post it note a month too much? why is him initiating a hug or kiss every now and then too much?  
surely if he genuienly loved me hed try just a little?

are our styles of love compatible long term?",1,1738282020.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

It' never been that bad before and I haven't done anything to strain myself. Before I even had a coffee, I had a painkiller and even with it, the pain hasn't fully left me. For a while, I felt the urge to either cry or rip my whole arm off. I could focus on nothing but the pain. If It persists into tomorrow I may have to consider the chance that something may be grievously wrong. I desperately hope it gets better tomorrow.

As for my work, I have good news and bad. We can start with the bad; I did nothing today. After my previous paragraph or grievances, what else can you expect. The good news; I was possessed by something last night while I was gathering the garbage. The rewrite to a scene a few chapters into the book just came to me and I spent hours making notes and jotting down all the dialogue for it. The scene isn't re-written yet but I have a draft of 978 words to work off of. It is only because I randomly got so much done that I don't feel bad doing nothing today. Writing all that also kept me up past 3 a.m. Can I blame todays pain on yesterdays bad sleep decisions? It's tempting. 

Anyway, my shoulder is acting up again. It's been enough hours for me to take another pill. Maybe I'll steal father's heating pad and see if that helps me. The best I've felt all day was when I was in the shower. 

Please let the pain magically go away tomorrow morning. The last thing I want is to deal with doctors. Wish me well. I'll be needing it.

1ie1evr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1ie1evr/request_for_feedback_on_one_of_my_essays_the_war/,Request for feedback on one of my essays - 'The War on Drugs' - [1822 words],"\[1822 words\]

What, truly, has the war on drugs managed to achieve? Clearly not the end of drugs. Millions of man hours have not made a dent. If you ask anyone in Britain if they think we are ‘winning’ the war on drugs, they will say no. Despite this, there is no plan for change. As Prime Minister Sunak said during his term “No. There are no plans to alter our tough stance on drugs.” 

This seems odd, because we usually see prolonged and systemic failure as a reason to at least discuss an issue, but with drugs we seem to struggle. Even when there are novel attempts, such as the SNP call to decriminalise all drugs for personal use, approaches seem slightly simplistic or just a little naive. The case study for what might happen in such a scenario is the end of Prohibition in the US, but before I go over that there are several points that must be remembered.

First, the end of prohibition in the US meant the legalisation of a single substance — Alcohol. It was not the legalisation of potentially hundreds of substances all at once. Many drugs are far more dangerous in combination than they are alone. Worse, anyone who does not want to take drugs will have to react to them all suddenly being everywhere all at once, which will generate an extreme and self-defeating backlash. If you are going to legalise drugs, you have to do it day by day and drug by drug. You have to give the public, the police and the health service time to understand how best to react to the appearance of varied and mixed drugs.

Second, there are some drugs that should not be legalised for any reason ever. Extremely dangerous drugs such as Desomorphine (known on the street as Krokodil) exist because they are cheap synthetic versions of drugs people actually want but cannot afford or get hold of. Desomorphine causes necrosis; flesh begins to rot on the living. Legalising even this kind of drug introduces something generated by the war on drugs into the post war world. Novel drugs are dangerous and should go through intense testing. Drugs like LSD, which we know by now can be (kind of) safe, should be on the docket. Black tar heroin should not be.

Third, legalisation of alcohol in prohibition was legalising a substance everyone in society was familiar with. If your friend came home drunk, everyone understood that it was coffee, bed or potentially the recovery position that was the order of the day. With drugs that is not the case. Each drug brings with it its own unique problems and advantages, requiring different reactions in the case of over consumption. Does your mother know what is normal for the average MDMA trip and what is a cause for concern? With each substance that is legalised, the entire society must be educated in what the drug does and how it works, as well as, crucially, how to reduce risk. The post war on drugs world cannot be built with the flick of a pen, as that is just asking for a counter reformation. What is necessary for sustained and positive change is a slow and studied approach, pausing when necessary, without losing a sense of momentum.

But with these points in mind, let us turn to the night prohibition ended. On December 5th, 1933, at 3:32pm, the thirty sixth state ratified the repeal of the 18th amendment. Comically, the state responsible for this was Utah. Minutes later, Under Secretary of State William Phillips slapped his John Hancock on the bill in DC and liquor was once again legal. FDR declared that he trusted the “good sense of the American people” not to abuse “this return of individual freedom.”  Despite what one might assume happened, there was no big party. The New York Times headline the next day was “New York Celebrates with Quiet Restraint…Greenwich Village was almost somber in early evening; the sparkle had gone out of speakeasies turned legal.” There were a few reasons for this. One was the Depression and the general scarcity of booze money. Another was preparation, as the brewers were yet to get back to business. The big reason though was, as Daniel Okrent notes in “Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition”, legalisation “made it harder, not easier, to get a drink”.  Along with legalisation came regulations on closing hours, age limits and Sunday service, as well as oversight from police. When prohibition was first enacted, alcohol use dropped significantly, but began to steadily increase again after organised markets expanded to service those still keen for a drink.  These markets were not bound by regulation: Alcohol appeared at baseball games and a thousand other locations it used to be difficult to get drunk at. The obvious space saving benefit of selling whiskey, as opposed to a heavy barrel of beer, meant that strong alcohol became far more popular than it was before, hence the rise of cocktails. Incidentally, weed has gone through the same journey, seen in the now insane THC content of various popular street strains as opposed to the now benign seeming strains of the 1960s. Legalisation resulted in alcohol becoming weaker and harder to get hold of.

But there were issues. When prohibition ended, many of the former bootleggers went legitimate, but some used their enormous profits to launch aggressive protection rackets. Even in a post war on drugs world, many criminal networks created during the war on drugs would persist. Because of this dynamic, a potential decriminalisation would be a dangerous moment that could see scores of gangs reaching out into all sorts of activities to make up for lost revenue.

Nonetheless, this danger does not mean we should not try. I do not say we should necessarily legalise everything, but we need to do something. As I see it, we have to act for two reasons:

One is the increasing variety and complexity of new drugs. For most of human history, for most of the world, there were only three drugs: alcohol, opium and cannabis. Once the Colombian exchange happened, cocaine was also unleashed from South America. There are now thousands of street drugs, with hundreds of thousands of regional combinations and mixtures. Synthetic drugs like Fentanyl can be made industrially and cheaply. Their addiction rate is far, far higher than anything most of us have ever encountered. By keeping the criminal laboratories open, we are inviting criminal gangs to keep experimenting with ever cheaper, ever nastier drugs. The quicker we end this dynamic, the better.

The second reason is that the enormous profits from drugs are fuelling many of the other problems we also need to deal with. Criminal enterprises are not siloed, closed groups of people happy to stay in their lane. Each group seeks to increase its profits and its territory, seizing different opportunities according to their different capabilities and risk profiles. Drugs provide the raw capital. With that income coming in, they are free to branch into human trafficking, protection rackets, or the conquest of other areas for the selling of drugs. The county lines crisis, where children are running bags of drugs across county lines for criminal gangs and the Channel crisis are directly fuelled by our purchase of drugs. The people smuggler in Calais is part of a network, a dark society, and drugs are the financial life blood of that network. While I do not think we can ‘defeat’ drugs, we can move drugs from a systemic problem into the realm of contained issue. We have proved we cannot achieve that by cracking down, so it is time to experiment, or maybe just even discuss, potentially trying different approaches. Controlled, careful sales of identified substances, coupled with a crackdown on illegal sellers (including attempts at cultural change) has to be worth a try. I have not even discussed here the effect on other countries, as most of the worst problems in Mexico and South America are caused by the developed world’s taste for drugs. There must be a better option.

An obvious place to start is with cannabis. “Since estimates began in the year ending December 1995, cannabis has consistently been the most used drug in England and Wales”.  By some estimates, in England and Wales, 30% (around 10 million people) aged between 16 to 64 have tried the drug at least once.  This is not a new or particularly dangerous drug, but it does have risks. As mentioned, THC content has climbed sharply, but there is also the risk of it being spiked, either with ‘Spice’ (synthetic cannabinoids which have unpredictable effects) or more benign substances. Legalisation or decriminalisation could begin on very moderate terms. A relatively light form of the drug could be manufactured with an extremely high tax rate, making it cost about as much as it does now, which could be ringfenced for the NHS, helping to offset concerns around health. (A hypothecated tax) Companies wishing to make products containing cannabis would be barred from going above a certain percentage or dosage. The export of the drug from British cannabis factories for recreational use would also be barred. The UK is already the world’s largest exporter of medicinal cannabis, so this should not be too big a problem for producers. (On a side note, oddly, 100 per cent of the medicinal cannabis products prescribed across the UK are currently imported.) 

Further, the consumption of cannabis would only be legal on private land to start with, making it still illegal in public as well as licensed houses and festivals. This could potentially change later, but the stages of repeal would have to go slowly and show value for each step, or they would risk being eventually struck down. There will be unexpected events and there will be problems, but by creating a body of evidence through careful introduction reformers would have time to assuage moral panics. Alongside the legal route, illegal cannabis, like illegal cigarettes, would become a more serious offence. This is a carrot and stick attempt to try to stop criminal gangs from capitalising on the opportunities.

This experiment is almost certainly worth doing. Given that the alternative is just more of the same, I believe the burden of evidence is on those who wish to do nothing rather than on me. At the very least, we need to be able to discuss these things without being accused of having gone soft on crime — In fact I contend the exact opposite. Currently, HM Government is acting as an enforcer for criminal enterprise by creating an artificial economy in which gangs and cartels can thrive. Real reform must at the very least be an option. To quote FDR on booze again, “Failure to do this honestly and courageously will be a living reproach to us all.”

It is time to discuss alternatives to the war on drugs.

Hey there! I’m looking for a room to rent or a roommate to team up on a new place. Ideally, I’d like to stay in Mid-Wilshire or within 10 minutes of the Sunset Strip.

About Me:
I’m in my mid-30s, work from home (but promise I won’t take over the space), and value a low-key, relaxed living environment. I’m clean—without being obsessive—and actually enjoy tidying up. Happy to handle household chores, and if you like breakfast and coffee, I’ve got you covered.

I love baking (expect shared treats), have a Costco membership you’re welcome to use, and enjoy gaming (Nintendo Switch & PS4) as well as reading—I have a solid little library.

I do have a cat, and he’s basically better than most people. He’s terrified of dogs, so unfortunately, that’s a dealbreaker.

Full disclosure: I smoke pot, but only outside. No hotboxing the living room—unless that’s your thing, then we can discuss.

About You:
You’re genuinely chill—meaning no passive-aggressive Post-Its. Clean-ish is great, just no week-old spaghetti in the sink. Ideally, you’re friendly, up for the occasional laugh, and down to create a relaxed, comfortable home.

The most-active contract in New York gained as much as 2.3% to a record $3.5555 a pound, before fluctuating between gains and losses. The spike came as a short-lived US tariff threat against Colombia added to trade uncertainties. It also followed fresh records over the past two sessions, bringing the relative strength index into overbought territory, indicating prices may have risen too far, too fast.

US President Donald Trump over the weekend ordered his administration to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia for refusing to allow two military planes carrying deported migrants to land. Soon after, the White House said he would hold off on imposing those measures after reaching a deal on the return of those deported.

The move rattled the outlook for coffee shipments at a time when most-active futures for the arabica variety have surged amid harvest shortfalls in major growers. Colombia is the world’s third-largest coffee producer and second-largest for the arabica variety favored for specialty brews. With at least 40% of its coffee exports heading to the US, it is the South American nation’s biggest market, US Department of Agriculture data show.

I am building a platform to help creators raise funds for their future projects. This platform is mainly for micro and medium size creators who always find hard to catch up with algorithms, constantly posting, struggling with finances or a second job, and still be creative. 

The idea in a nutshell,

1. Creator publishes their project with basic details about it on our platform. Posts a video about this project, requests support, shares link to the platform.

2. Followers come on the platform donate/back a project as much as they want. 

3. Creator completes the project, posts content etc.

4. At a creator’s discretion and if the project is successful, The creator could refund the donated money to supporters. (This is totally up to creator)

Why a new platform?

1. kickstarter/go fund me are more charities and made for EVERYONE and EVERYTHING. My platform will be solely for social media creators and their followers.

2. Patreon is too much work for a small/medium creator and they rob creators with 10-15% fees

3. Ko-fi/Buy me a coffee - these are hand outs that most creators don’t feel comfortable using.


My question to the group,

1. Do you have any projects that you are not able to take on because of lack of money, team, equipments?
2. If you have between 10k-100k followers with reasonable engagement, would you publish your dream projects to request funding from your followers?
3. If you get funded and a project is successful, how likely are you to give back the money to your supporters or to a charity?
4. Do you see any gaps in this platform or idea?

Ah, the Atlanta Hawks versus the Cleveland Cavaliers—a classic showdown of ""David vs. Goliath,"" except David forgot his slingshot and Goliath is on a winning streak. The Cavaliers are priced at a comfy 1.19, while the Hawks are sitting at a long-shot 5.25. If you're feeling lucky or just enjoy living on the edge, betting on the Hawks might be your cup of tea. But remember, underdogs only win about 25% of the time in basketball, so maybe keep that wager small enough to still afford your morning coffee.

The spread is set at 11 points in favor of the Cavaliers, which suggests that the oddsmakers are expecting a bit of a blowout. If you think the Hawks can keep it closer than that, taking them with the points at 1.91 might be a savvy move. Just imagine the Hawks soaring majestically, only to be gently swatted down by the Cavaliers' defense.

As for the total points, it's set at a whopping 240.0. That's a lot of buckets, folks! If you think both teams will be shooting like they're auditioning for the next Space Jam, the Over at 1.91 could be your play. But if you think the game will be more brick than swish, the Under at the same odds might be the safer bet.

In conclusion, while the Cavaliers are the clear favorites, there's always a chance for some underdog magic. But if you're asking for my best bet, I'd say take the Cavaliers to cover the spread. After all, it's not every day you see a Hawk outmuscle a Cavalier.",1,1738279459.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

I got my appetite back right away when starting lifiting and not smoking so I was told just eat and eat a bunch cause I'll need it so I just ate when I was hungry. I tried to eat cleanish but I also ate lots of pizza and other things of the like cause I was just happy to be putting on weight since I was severely under weight. Now I'm about 205-208. I have no idea what to do with my diet. I have a protine shake most days whuch i actually just toss the powder into my coffee actually and otherwise just eat throughout the day like usually 3 eggs for breakfast/lunch together a cpl hours after I get up. A snack of yogurt a few hours later. Sometimes some hot dogs cause I'm lazy and they're easy. Then sometimes I munch whatever I can find before a later dinner cause my wife works late so I'll eat some PBJ sandwiches or poptarts. Maybe some more yogurts or little tangerine oranges sometimes some leftover dinner from the day before. Then usually I eat something like chicken/pork chops/some kinda meat but not fish cause idk i hate fish and broccoli/carrots/some form of veggies and mashed potatoes or sidekicks or something of the like.. now that I'm at just about 205lbs I don't want to get too much bigger too fast. My target weight was about 200lbs give or take so I'm okay with where I'm at but I want to start trying to be better with actually eating right to put more muscle and less fat on over time.

The small cut of meat TJ had been able to salvage from the coyote body sizzled over coals, and the scent of cooking meat set his mouth to watering. To get to this point had been more of an exercise in preparedness than he’d been previously ready for, and he thought about how he’d disassembled the bodies.

Once he had built the fire up from a steady flicker to a true blaze, TJ sat with his hands extended towards the dancing flames, the heat making his mostly numbed fingers tingle. As the cold leached from his hands, TJ’s right hand complained and ached with the return of sensation while his left whined about the blisters he’d given himself creating the fire in the first place.. The fire roared and crackled, the pine-rich wood frequently popping and sending flurries of sparks into the air. Pine burns fast and hot, and TJ forced himself up to his feet before long, gathering the thickest branches he could manage without exhausting himself or tearing his wounded shoulder back open. 

With enough of a supply of firewood to ensure that he wouldn’t be left with nothing before long, TJ could actually focus on the corpses. They represented thousands and thousands of calories, energy he couldn’t leave behind. He’d never butchered an animal before, and now he had to learn quickly. When would the meat go bad? It was around freezing, so could it be counted as refrigerated?

Regardless, he couldn’t cook the meat while the fur was still on it. And how to cut it off? TJ searched around, hoping to find a magically sharpened rock that would function perfectly as a knife. No luck. In fact, much of the stone around here was crumbly and weak, wholly unable to keep any sort of an edge. Instead, he’d need to get BACK UP and find a rock that could actually help him. He couldn’t help but curse himself at how he’d laughed at his old man back in the day when TJ had asked him why he always had a pocket knife. The old man’s response was simply, “A man needs a knife. Whenever you don’t have it is when you need it.” He missed his dad. He’d know what to do now, but he’d been gone half a decade now, his mom too. Probably better they weren’t around for this. Mari… well, TJ was lying if he said he didn’t wish she was with him right now. Having learned his lesson, TJ very carefully wiped at his eyes without brushing his nose and set to finding a good rock.

TJ whistled the *Indiana Jones* theme song to himself as he wandered around, feeling slightly more like an adventurer as he did so. Who knew, maybe he’d find a whip and a Nazi to punch while he was at it. Eventually, he was blessed to find a little deposit of a harder, darker stone than much of the sandstone that surrounded him, and TJ grabbed a couple and happily trotted back to his fire to see if he couldn’t create a blade of some sort from it.

Once, with a master’s guidance, he’d made an obsidian blade, but this, unfortunately, was nothing like that. The stones were nearly spherical, and as TJ smacked them together again and again, he wasn’t able to make anything that even remotely resembled a cutting edge. 

“Come. On. You. Little. Bastard. And. Become. A. Knife.” He repeated, smashing the stones together again and again with each word. Fortunately, on the fourth repetition of the same line, one of the rocks he was holding split almost cleanly through the center, leaving two half-spheres with a mostly flat face from between them. “Halfway there.” TJ grumbled before setting one of the stones with the new flat face perpendicular to the ground on a large nearby rock. There, he grabbed one of the remaining whole stones and, with growing force, smashed it again and again into the rock he wanted to have become his knife. 

With a resounding crack, the stone split, and TJ cheered when he picked up several of the shards that had broken into flat disks with a serviceably sharp edge. Finally armed with a prehistoric utensil, he turned to the corpses. He was sickened and again nearly vomited as he was again forced to confront the reality of how he’d been forced to kill every one–crushing their skulls. Their heads hung awkwardly to the side, and the bone was obviously shattered while blood and mashed flesh dripped from their mouths. 

“Well. Sorry. I’ll eat you, at least, so you’re not dead for nothing.” TJ grabbed the first coyote he’d killed and laid it out flat on the ground. It laid there, and he thought of the dogs he’d grown up loving. Then, he pulled up his sleeves and began attempting butchery. It was hard, bloody, disgusting work, and TJ did end up retching as he accidentally cut open its intestines and coyote shit spilled over his hands. Worse, he didn’t have water to spare to wash his hands or anything else, and he was slowed even more by having to return to the fire to stoke it and warm his chilled fingers pretty frequently. Eventually, he did have a roughly skinned and unappetizing looking coyote thigh, which he speared with a stick and held over the fire.

Of course, he accidentally burned the meat. After he dropped it in the fire. Because the stick broke. His poor Nana’s ears would curl hearing the string of profanities he’d shouted after that, but TJ didn’t care. He didn’t even care enough to scrape the burnt flesh off the bone before tearing into it. It was rangy, tough, and dry, while what little of the juice remaining in the “drumstick’s” skin dribbled down his chin. It wasn’t good. But it was food, and that was enough of a spice that TJ tore through the leg in record time. 

Annoyed by the blood, viscera, excrement, and whatever else that coated his hands, TJ attempted to wipe himself clean on one of the coyote’s fur to limited success. He needed water, and the nearest water he knew of was the snow and ice that coated the next peak. He estimated it’d be another 20 minutes of hiking to get there, so maybe an hour to get there, fill up his water, drink his fill, fill up more, see where he needed to go, and then return to his fire. And now that he’d experienced how much better it was to not be freezing his balls off, walking over there in his shredded jacket and stupid mesh shorts sounded like hell.

It was disgusting, but the coyotes could maybe help with that too…

—-

Another two cooked thighs and an hour’s worth of skinning the three coyotes, going off his HP recovery of 10, assuming this was light activity, resulted with the most disgusting leg warmers that TJ had ever imagined. He wrapped two of the coyote pelts that he’d crappily pulled from the bodies around his thighs while the third was currently being scraped of all fat, blood, and whatever else was attached to the skin under the pelt. Once TJ was somewhat satisfied with the results, he held the most intact fur skin side down over the fire in an attempt to make what he was about to do less horrendously disgusting. Then, when it was warm and the skin under the fur was beginning to crisp and pop, TJ pulled his waistband out and wrapped the pelt around his waist between his shorts and his underwear. It was so pleasantly warm that he almost forgot how disgusting this was. 

TJ didn’t give himself any additional time to think about it, to be grossed out, or anything. Instead, he grabbed his backpack, now empty of everything except his makeshift knives, water bottle, and goldfish, and, after piling several more thick branches onto the fire, prepared for his hike towards the next summit. Just earlier this morning, he’d been sleeping in his comfortable bed and drinking coffee, and now, he was shivering here. He couldn’t help but think of his morning.

Woke up to his alarm, which was an excited toddler jumping on him. How Junior consistently woke up at 6:30am every day, summer through winter, was one of the universe’s greatest mysteries. Regardless of how the three year-old woke himself up, he always made his way out of his room and into TJ’s, where, uncaring of how much or little sleep his dad had gotten, he happily patted TJ’s face until he woke. 

“Park? Go park? Big one? Please?”

TJ grumbled as good-naturedly as he could manage. A Saturday morning in early January was as good as any to go to the park, he supposed. 

“It’s still early, bud. Let’s do breakfast first, then we’ll figure out going to the park, K?”

Though Junior whined and moped about not being taken to the park the same instant he woke, a bowl full of “foot woop” took the edge of his rage off. Then, given the sun still hadn’t risen, TJ cajoled and guided the distractible kid from room to room as he vacuumed, swept, and tidied. Still, it was only 9 by the time all the chores were done, and Junior was back to begging to go to the park. Southern Arizona wasn’t so cold as most of the world in the middle of the winter, but TJ did force Junior into a jacket and long pants before they left. All the child’s protests about how “Daddy not wearing pants!” were summarily dismissed with “Well, dads make the rules” and Junior quickly forgot the despotic unfairness of dads. Instead, he complained at the walk through Walmart. Then, he was heartbroken by only going through the McDonalds drive through, because how dare they visit merely for coffee? Only the promise of immediately proceeding towards the park kept the hysterics in check.

At the park, Junior happily clambered up and down and around whatever he could reach. Though it would be a beautiful day later on, in Tempe, it was only 45 or so degrees out, so no other kids had managed to convince their parents to get out of their warm houses just yet. Thus, TJ happily played alone with his son, making sure he didn’t fall from the jungle gym or eat too much sand. Then, once the caffeine had fully hit his system (and worked its way through in the freezing public restroom), TJ asked the fateful question.

“Wanna run?”

With squeals of excitement, Junior dragged TJ back to the car, where he pulled the jogging stroller out and, as soon as it was set up, Junior threw himself in while clapping for TJ to “Go fast! Super fast!” TJ only had enough time to get up to speed before he’d smashed his face on a suddenly appearing wall and found himself on his ass with his vision swimming and his ears ringing. Then, he’d hiked, and fought, and suffered. And here he was.

Shaking his lonely thinking from his head, TJ stood and began walking uphill. Water awaited him, and to take his mind from the past, he asked a question that had been burning for a while, but only now he felt he could actually ask it.

“Why are these animals attacking? A single coyote, or even a smaller pack would never attack a person around here. What happened?”

**The native fauna has been adjusted by the Divine System so that they may better participate in the selection process for hopeful divines.**

“So now they’re all bloodthirsty or something?”

**To put it in so few words, correct.**

“Then what can I–Shit. Are reptiles still hibernating? Or are they more active now?”

**The physiology of much of the native fauna has been biologically adjusted by the Divine System to be more active.**

“So are there any rattlesnakes nearby?” TJ looked around warily, not trusting to hear a rattle before receiving a deadly bite.

**The Divine System does not give additional information to Participants that can be considered hints or especially helpful.**

“Probably, then.” TJ forced himself to be quiet instead as he continued his tracks towards the snow-covered summit. Every step burned his injured calf, and though he’d patched it as well as he could, his shoulder’s wound cried out with every step. The only upside he could think of other than impending water was that the new mountain he began to scale was mostly bare compared to the one he had left behind, and if any coyotes decided to come attack, he’d have enough time to pick up a rock or something to smash his assailant with. Plus, a part of him realized that there was no guarantee that he’d be able to complete the requirements for the Neophyte Class anytime soon, and it might be better to just kill two more animals and become a Zealot. Even so, the Neophyte Class just called to him, and TJ didn’t want to throw in the towel just yet.

The twenty minute hike passed without any additional incident, and TJ stepped to this higher peak and looked across the valley between mountains. There, maybe six or seven miles farther down, was a cabin, tucked in a small clearing with an ATV trail leading up to it. Getting up to this mountain had taken him about 20 minutes, and TJ estimated it was only half a mile to get here. Looking up, it was just about midday, so there were only about five hours of sunlight left. Worse, the brush was thick and unmanageable down there, so TJ would have to slow himself even more to be especially careful to make sure he wasn’t ambushed or even just broke an ankle with an unlucky misstep. 

“How would my Vitality’s HP regeneration help me with a broken bone?” He suddenly asked.

**Returning to full HP does not mean that lasting injuries have been completely healed. Instead, it signifies the peak of health available to the Participant excluding major injuries. At your level of Vitality, it will take two weeks for a minor fracture to be healed, and up to six for a major break of the bone to return to its previously whole state.**

Yeah, that’d be a death sentence. Grumbling to himself about how he’d need to come back tomorrow to make sure he could make it to the cabin before the sun set behind the mountains, TJ grabbed a couple handfuls of water to place into his water bottle to melt. Grandpa had said something about how eating plain snow was worse for you in a survival situation than finding a creek nearby, something about how snow made you colder than the water would. Given that Grandpa was right about the stupid knife, he’d listen about the snow. 

TJ shook the metal bottle, the crunchy, more ice than snow breaking apart and melting under his ministrations. A minute later, he opened it and took a long drink. Beautiful. His parched throat gloried in the taste, a couple pebbles and pine needles included. He drank so deeply that TJ could feel the cold water settling and sloshing in his stomach, and though it was uncomfortable, he was happy for it. Then, preparing himself to go back to his impromptu camp, TJ filled the water bottle up once again with the ice, smashing the pointy bits that refused to let the cap screw on. Again whistling to himself, this time *Star Wars*, more John Williams, TJ made his way back to the camp.

Once he left the barren mountaintop, TJ picked up a rock and hefted it in his right hand. Wasn’t much of a weapon, but it was leaps better than nothing, and if a coyote tried to take a bite out of him again, he could kill it without having to feel its bones crack under his feet. He was lucky, however, that he didn’t have to kill anything before getting back to his hot coals. 

The fire had mostly died down, but TJ had been confident that there would still be coals upon his return. He was correct, and a couple handfuls of pine needles and kindling let his fire return to its previous glory. 

Now, if he was going to stay the night here before setting off towards the cabin tomorrow, he might as well make sure his night wasn’t entirely miserable. Remembering that a heat reflector of some sort would help the fire’s heat be better directed towards him, TJ let himself rest for just long enough to cook a coyote shoulder and eat about half of it. His belly was still full of the water he’d stuffed himself with, and he wouldn’t have any more water than what was in his bottle until he made the trek back to the other mountain. TJ wasn’t about to force more food down his gullet and make himself sick. 

With a grumble, he walked off to gather the longest, thickest branches he could muster. There wasn’t much nearby, and TJ was loathe to get himself distracted looking for fallen branches and trees just so a coyote, mountain lion, or rattlesnake could kill him. After five trips back and forth dragging another couple of long branches, TJ was lucky enough to stumble across a fallen tree with most of its branches intact. Taking a big rock in hand, he smashed a dozen of the branches off before lugging them back to camp. Then he made another trip. And another. And another. 

And finally, he had enough branches to make the most rudimentary of heat reflectors for his fire. Then, TJ needed to gather enough wood to keep his fire going through the night. That took him another two hours, at least. He wasn’t sure how long, since this level of hiking and carrying and transporting negated his HP recovery. TJ did take the time every two loads to sit next to the fire and watch his HP tick up two more points until it had recovered to 50/100. Then, with enough fire to keep him going through the night and enough of a shelter to keep him from dying from exposure, TJ sat and watched the fire.

**Occupation unlocked.** 

Wait, what?

Here's a post from a very experienced respected coach and a long time serving coach at MIR -:

At the end of last year, just before Christmas, Dr. Gregg (owner of Macquarie Ice Rink) announced his vision to make Macquarie Ice Rink the best in Australia. Everyone clapped and shared in the excitement.

Unfortunately, after 40 years of ice-skating history at Macquarie Ice Rink, the sport has become too ‘hot’ to handle-quite literally. The ice has started melting dramatically, and in an effort to ‘save’ the rink, the New Management Team: Renzo Antonio Münster- Executive General Manager and Engineer, Luke Cullen - MIR Skate Director and Ice Technician , and Kathy Rayner - MIR Executive Accounts Manager and HR has removed everything related to figure skating. This includes 28 coaches, all figure skating activities, the Learn to Skate school, holiday camps, Coffee Club, Kiddie Club, even the trophy cabinet from the canteen area. The Macquarie Ice Skating Club logo has also disappeared.

The rink was closed for a week, and when it reopened, all traces of figure skating were gone-logos of hockey and speed skating clubs were put on the ice, and even the big TV screen no longer showed anything related to figure skating.

It seems apparent from this activity that all forms of Figure Skating are permanently  banished from Macquarie Ice Rink.

The General Public needs to be informed and made aware of this occurrence as it is a severe threat to the future existence of Macquarie  Ice Rink as a Sporting Facility on the North Shore.

To shape a beautiful bonsai, you must cut away many branches and bend the tree into a new form. It seems Macquarie Ice Rink is becoming a ‘bonsai” carefully reshaped, but at what cost? - end of post.

BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE to this sad, unfair, disgraceful story.

A pair of coaches who are being investigated by APSA (Australian professional skating association), they are welcome to come back and continue to coach at MIR 
Investigation is ongoing about how they verbally abuse, mentally abuse, physically abuse, psychologically abuse their skaters.

1. They do not provide the filter holder with the unit. *I have to buy it?* I have a lot of filters left from the Cuisinart, so rather than throw them away I caved & bought the stupid holder.

2. I guess this one's on me: I went on the website saw filter holder, and ordered it. Later I realize there are TWO sizes and I ordered the wrong one. I have to get a RA to return it PLUS pay shipping. I'll be lucky if I get $1.50 back to my card by that time.

When I told my wife I ordered the wrong size holder - she asked ""how many machines do they make?"" I went on and called them up on one page: *close to thirty.* Seriously- *thirty?* Remember  the days when companies focused on making one good solid product?

So, I actually love the wood panelling and couch. I do not want to paint the wood. I also generally love the view of the living room from the second photo. But I think the area has something off with it. 

Layout: My boyfriend refuses to put the couch in front of the window because he wants to be able to see people when they come up. I agree with this. Additionally, this is a south facing window, the only two in our house, and several of our plants need the space there. Also, the couch is also too big to sit horizontally in the room, so unless I'm moving it diagonally, it has to stay where it is. The chaise can move to the other side by the wall but it reduces our space to comfortably watch tv. I do not want to buy another couch; this is new, and I don't have the cash to buy something else of the same quality. 

Furniture: The side table may be going in the next few days since someone on Facebook Marketplace took interest. The coffee table is old from my last few apartments when I was a broke college student, and I'm willing to get that replaced. If so, what would look good? An oval coffee table? A glass table? Would any colours be best, like white or natural wood or is a medium/dark stained wood fitting? Something antique? I was thinking something like glass because it would add more texture to the place but not sure if that's a good idea. The rug is here to stay; it looks low contrast from the photo but it actually has a combination of browns, blues, beiges, and greens and I really like it in person. 

Styling: I'd like to add decorative items to the coffee table without blocking the view of the tv. Do you have any ideas of low (less than a foot tall) items that I could put on there to style it?

Art: I want to move the right-most piece of art above the couch to the other wall, under the smaller piece so it looks more like a balanced gallery wall. Then I want to sell/give away the unframed oil painting on the left side or move it to another room. However, now I would need ideas on what to put above the couch. I'm thinking of some options: 1. wall-mounted shelves, with plants and vases and other decor items on them, 2. wall mounted galvanized steel pots with small plants in them, fully leaning into the biophilic style, 3. a thin console table holding some vases and other decor items with some matching frame artwork above it, 4. a gallery wall, 5. a large horizontal mirror with some plants or artwork on either side. It kind of feels overwhelming to me to do two gallery walls right next to each other so I'd probably prefer one of the options with no artwork. ",1,1738278353.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False
1ie0bbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalBusiness/comments/1ie0bbx/sharing_my_process_for_unlocking_hidden_profits/,Sharing My Process for Unlocking Hidden Profits Using the Value Ladder,"Running a business is great, but it can be tough. You might not have enough customers. Or maybe you have to lower your prices all the time to compete. It can feel like you're stuck, especially if your business doesn't seem exciting or new. There may not be much stuff to attract customers.

But guess what? If this sounds like you, you might be sitting on a ***goldmine***.

I help people with regular, ""boring"" businesses make a lot more money by implementing the value ladder strategy. I want to share it with you, too!

**Here's what we'll talk about:**

* Why regular businesses can be great.
* What a value ladder is.
* The big mistake many businesses make.
* How a value ladder can help your business.
* Bonus Example

# Why ""Boring” Businesses Can Be Better Than Fancy Startups

Traditional (aka Boring) businesses are often ignored. People want to start the newest, coolest thing. But this is good for you! It means two important things. Let's ask two questions:

**Question 1:** If a business isn't new or cool, why is it still around?

**Answer:** Because people need it! If a business is still alive, it means it's helping people. Businesses that don't help people disappear.

**Question 2:** If it's a good business, why hasn't it changed much?

**Answer:** Because it's not attracting the people who only want new, shiny things. This usually means less competition for you! You can do really well because others are busy with other stuff.

# The Problem: Doing One Thing and Waiting

Many businesses sell only one thing to a customer and then wait for the next customer. This is a bad idea from my exposure.

Imagine a thirsty, tired, and hungry man named John coming into a boring store. He wants water.

Most businesses would just sell him the water. They only make a little money from a bottle of water.

So how do we make more money? With a **value ladder**!

# The Value Ladder: Step Up Your Game

""What's a value ladder?"" you might ask.

It's simple: offer more things to your customers, and they'll pay more. It sounds easy, but there's a trick to doing it right.

Let's think about John again.

He goes to a regular store, buys water, and leaves. He's not thirsty, but he's still hungry and tired.

Now imagine John goes to a store that uses a value ladder (VL = Value laddered), Let's call it ""VL Store.""

In a VL Store business, we could add a large banner offering free cold water and a comfortable seating area. You might wonder, ""Why offer this for free when we could charge for it?""

The answer is simple: this serves as the first step to attracting customers.

If your business is similar to the one next door, **what would make John choose yours?** Maybe luck or proximity—but if he was coming from the other direction or if another competitor opened before you, that advantage disappears.

By providing a compelling reason for customers to walk through your doors, we create an edge that differentiates our business from the rest.

# Step One: The Free Gift

The first step should be simple and come with almost zero risk for your customers to engage with your business.

Not everyone who takes the first step will move on to the second or third, and that’s okay. **The goal is to attract as many people as possible to take that initial step**, as this naturally increases the likelihood that more will continue along the journey.

Even those who only take the first step **will remember your business** when they need the next level of value. **We’ll be the first name that comes to mind when they or their friends require your services**. **Why**?

Because people trust their own experiences—even small ones.

>

# Step Two: The Next Level of Engagement

A vending machine stocked with fresh products—but at a slightly higher price.

Note: charging extra at this stage isn’t always necessary; in some cases, you might even offer a discount. The key point here is understanding the psychology behind the next step.

**Why would someone pay extra on the next step when they could take your free offering and find a cheaper option elsewhere?** While it’s true they *could* do that, the real question is: ***Would they actually go through the effort?***

To minimize the chances of them seeking alternatives,

>

A few extra cents is often not enough of a difference for someone to walk a mile just to save money.

# Step Three: Helping More

John's drinking his water and resting. But he's still hungry. Now imagine VL Store also has sandwiches and coffee. etc….

This kind of store already exists in some places. But not everywhere! Have you seen two similar stores, one doing great and one not? The one doing great probably uses a better value ladder.

# Bonus Example

A gym typically offers subscriptions and personal training at a high fee. However, by structuring a value ladder, you can attract more customers and gradually guide them toward higher-value services.

# VL Gym

1. **Risk-Free Entry:** Offer a **3-day free trial** with a personal trainer and a **personalized plan**. This removes any risk for potential customers and allows them to experience your premium service. Even if they don’t sign up immediately, they’ll talk about their experience—driving word-of-mouth marketing, one of the most powerful forms of promotion.🔹 **Important Tip:** Don’t reveal the price of your premium offer at this stage.

# Why ""Boring” Businesses Can Be Better Than Fancy Startups

Traditional (aka Boring) businesses are often ignored. People want to start the newest, coolest thing. But this is good for you! It means two important things. Let's ask two questions:

**Question 1:** If a business isn't new or cool, why is it still around?

**Answer:** Because people need it! If a business is still alive, it means it's helping people. Businesses that don't help people disappear.

**Question 2:** If it's a good business, why hasn't it changed much?

**Answer:** Because it's not attracting the people who only want new, shiny things. This usually means less competition for you! You can do really well because others are busy with other stuff.

# The Problem: Doing One Thing and Waiting

Many businesses sell only one thing to a customer and then wait for the next customer. This is a bad idea from my exposure.

Imagine a thirsty, tired, and hungry man named John coming into a boring store. He wants water.

Most businesses would just sell him the water. They only make a little money from a bottle of water.

So how do we make more money? With a **value ladder**!

# The Value Ladder: Step Up Your Game

""What's a value ladder?"" you might ask.

It's simple: offer more things to your customers, and they'll pay more. It sounds easy, but there's a trick to doing it right.

Let's think about John again.

He goes to a regular store, buys water, and leaves. He's not thirsty, but he's still hungry and tired.

Now imagine John goes to a store that uses a value ladder (VL = Value laddered), Let's call it ""VL Store.""

In a VL Store business, we could add a large banner offering free cold water and a comfortable seating area. You might wonder, ""Why offer this for free when we could charge for it?""

The answer is simple: this serves as the first step to attracting customers.

If your business is similar to the one next door, **what would make John choose yours?** Maybe luck or proximity—but if he was coming from the other direction or if another competitor opened before you, that advantage disappears.

By providing a compelling reason for customers to walk through your doors, we create an edge that differentiates our business from the rest.

# Step One: The Free Gift

The first step should be simple and come with almost zero risk for your customers to engage with your business.

Not everyone who takes the first step will move on to the second or third, and that’s okay. **The goal is to attract as many people as possible to take that initial step**, as this naturally increases the likelihood that more will continue along the journey.

Even those who only take the first step **will remember your business** when they need the next level of value. **We’ll be the first name that comes to mind when they or their friends require your services**. **Why**?

Because people trust their own experiences—even small ones.

# Step Two: The Next Level of Engagement

A vending machine stocked with fresh products—but at a slightly higher price.

Note: charging extra at this stage isn’t always necessary; in some cases, you might even offer a discount. The key point here is understanding the psychology behind the next step.

**Why would someone pay extra on the next step when they could take your free offering and find a cheaper option elsewhere?** While it’s true they *could* do that, the real question is: ***Would they actually go through the effort?***

To minimize the chances of them seeking alternatives,

A few extra cents is often not enough of a difference for someone to walk a mile just to save money.

# Step Three: Helping More

John's drinking his water and resting. But he's still hungry. Now imagine VL Store also has sandwiches and coffee. etc….

This kind of store already exists in some places. But not everywhere! Have you seen two similar stores, one doing great and one not? The one doing great probably uses a better value ladder.

1ie08n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEatsDrivers/comments/1ie08n4/some_bs_ordering_today/,Some BS ordering today,"I'm a driver and I also order UE cuz I'm lazy like that. 

This afternoon I ordered from an Einstein Bros, and I saw it was paired with another order, and mine was last to be dropped off. Totally fine, as a driver, great, I'm glad someone got extra monies. 

However, my food and coffee get here and it's cold AF. Maybe the driver didn't have a warm bag and maybe the store just didn't have any option to keep them warm while they waited for th driver. Fine. I get it. Believe me. 

What makes me mad tho, is I tipped 6.00 because there's an Einsteins less than a mile from my house (again, I woke up with a headache, didn't want to leave the house, lazy, etc) so 6.00 (plus a 1.50 base fare) should have been a great tip for driving next to nothing. 

I HAAATTTEEEEEEEE that instead of my order going to the closest option to me, it went to an Einsteins ACROSS TOWN, 7 miles away. I have no control of that. But what. The fuck. 

Like from a driver standpoint, you just quadrupled someone's drive and made the trip barely worth it. And from my standpoint, I purposely gave a bigger tip because I ""knew"" it was a fast order. 

And I try to have sympathy for ""low tippers"" because I know shit comes up like this. Half of the 5.00 orders for 20 miles are from shit like McDonald's and you KNOW there's a McDonald's close to their house. It fucks everyone involved. 

So here we are, all getting f-ed. 

Will I continue working for UE and ordering UE? Yes. 

Am I ranting to get something off my chest cuz I'm salty this afternoon? Also a big fat yes.

But guess what? If this sounds like you, you might be sitting on a ***goldmine***.

I help people with regular, ""boring"" businesses make a lot more money by implementing the value ladder strategy. I want to share it with you, too!

* Why regular businesses can be great.
* What a value ladder is.

# Why ""Boring” Businesses Can Be Better Than Fancy Startups

Traditional (aka Boring) businesses are often ignored. People want to start the newest, coolest thing. But this is good for you! It means two important things. Let's ask two questions:

**Question 1:** If a business isn't new or cool, why is it still around?

**Answer:** Because people need it! If a business is still alive, it means it's helping people. Businesses that don't help people disappear.

**Question 2:** If it's a good business, why hasn't it changed much?

**Answer:** Because it's not attracting the people who only want new, shiny things. This usually means less competition for you! You can do really well because others are busy with other stuff.

# The Problem: Doing One Thing and Waiting

Many businesses sell only one thing to a customer and then wait for the next customer. This is a bad idea from my exposure.

Imagine a thirsty, tired, and hungry man named John coming into a boring store. He wants water.

Most businesses would just sell him the water. They only make a little money from a bottle of water.

So how do we make more money? With a **value ladder**!

# The Value Ladder: Step Up Your Game

""What's a value ladder?"" you might ask.

It's simple: offer more things to your customers, and they'll pay more. It sounds easy, but there's a trick to doing it right.

Let's think about John again.

He goes to a regular store, buys water, and leaves. He's not thirsty, but he's still hungry and tired.

Now imagine John goes to a store that uses a value ladder (VL = Value laddered), Let's call it ""VL Store.""

In a VL Store business, we could add a large banner offering free cold water and a comfortable seating area. You might wonder, ""Why offer this for free when we could charge for it?""

The answer is simple: this serves as the first step to attracting customers.

If your business is similar to the one next door, **what would make John choose yours?** Maybe luck or proximity—but if he was coming from the other direction or if another competitor opened before you, that advantage disappears.

By providing a compelling reason for customers to walk through your doors, we create an edge that differentiates our business from the rest.

# Step One: The Free Gift

The first step should be simple and come with almost zero risk for your customers to engage with your business.

Not everyone who takes the first step will move on to the second or third, and that’s okay. **The goal is to attract as many people as possible to take that initial step**, as this naturally increases the likelihood that more will continue along the journey.

Even those who only take the first step **will remember your business** when they need the next level of value. **We’ll be the first name that comes to mind when they or their friends require your services**. **Why**?

Because people trust their own experiences—even small ones.

# Step Two: The Next Level of Engagement

A vending machine stocked with fresh products—but at a slightly higher price.

Note: charging extra at this stage isn’t always necessary; in some cases, you might even offer a discount. The key point here is understanding the psychology behind the next step.

**Why would someone pay extra on the next step when they could take your free offering and find a cheaper option elsewhere?** While it’s true they *could* do that, the real question is: ***Would they actually go through the effort?***

To minimize the chances of them seeking alternatives,

A few extra cents is often not enough of a difference for someone to walk a mile just to save money.

# Step Three: Helping More

John's drinking his water and resting. But he's still hungry. Now imagine VL Store also has sandwiches and coffee. etc….

This kind of store already exists in some places. But not everywhere! Have you seen two similar stores, one doing great and one not? The one doing great probably uses a better value ladder.

I just want to update po na I have reached out to the bank, and tama po, considered valid and authorized transaction so mahirap i-dispute. I also reached out to a fraud analyst friend and sabi nga nya I can try, pero tedious process. I’ll sell the tickets na lang. I’m selling for the original price lang + sm online fee na 100 so 18,600 each. 

Yes, Enhypen concert po. My sister was able to snag these vvip tickets at 11:10am. I heard timestamp is important.

As for my sister, I’ve interrogated her. She said she was being pressured by her classmates to do a “pasa-buy” since she had mentioned na may credit card ang ate nya (which is me). She planned to tell me daw last Monday pero na-busy daw sya sa school works. Her plan is to have one ticket, and the other two is for the classmates na magbabayad daw through installment. I asked her anong ipangbabayad nya sakin since gusto nya yung isang ticket, sabi nya “kaltas” daw sa allowance nya.

After kong tumawag sa bank para ipa-replace yung card and umiyak (lol naiyak ako sa stress) sinabi ko sa mother namin yung nangyari, and mind you, nasampal sampal si sister.

Now for the punishment, si mama na ang nagsabi. Grounded si sister, school-bahay lang muna. bawal muna gumala gala at pumunta sa kpop events nya (like yung nagmimeet up sila sa coffee shops ng kapwa fans nya). Sya din maghahanap ng buyer para sa tickets. If hindi nya mabenta, ibabawas sa allowance nya monthly. And hindi ko na din itutuloy yung promise kong iphone 15 sa kanya. Sinabi ko sa kanyang nadisappoint ako nang sobra, at hindi ko na kaya ipahiram sa kanya yung mga gamit ko :(

This happened for the first time, tiwala ako sa kanya before kasi wala namang ganitong nangyari dati. I trusted her with my phone and she knew the pw kasi hinihiram nya to take her selfies. I even let her order foods/shopee with my card (kaya sya familiar pano gamitin/saan kukunin 🥲)

Now, I told her na wala na akong tiwala sa kanya and if sa ibang tao nya to ginawa, mas malala pa ang punishment. If professional counseling is needed, I’d like my sister to have it. I know my sister is a good kid, na-pressure lang ata talaga kasi frequent concert-goers ata yung classmates nya. I hope hindi na ‘to mangyari kasi baka kaladkarin na sya ni mader.

Thanks po mga advise nyo! (bumili na din ako ng cvv stickers). I appreciate po yung mga comments nyo! Salamat nang marami 🫶🏻",279,1738277947.0,PHCreditCards,81,0.99,False

You might not have enough customers. Or maybe you have to lower your prices all the time to compete. It can feel like you're stuck, especially if your business doesn't seem exciting or new. There may not be much stuff to attract customers.

But guess what? If this sounds like you, you might be sitting on a ***goldmine***.

I help people with regular, ""boring"" businesses make a lot more money by implementing the value ladder strategy. I want to share it with you, too!

**Here's what we'll talk about:**

* Why regular businesses can be great.
* What a value ladder is.
* The big mistake many businesses make.
* How a value ladder can help your business.
* Bonus example

# Why ""Boring” Businesses Can Be Better Than Fancy Startups

Traditional (aka Boring) businesses are often ignored. People want to start the newest, coolest thing. But this is good for you! It means two important things. Let's ask two questions:

**Question 1:** If a business isn't new or cool, why is it still around?

**Answer:** Because people need it! If a business is still alive, it means it's helping people. Businesses that don't help people disappear.

**Question 2:** If it's a good business, why hasn't it changed much?

**Answer:** Because it's not attracting the people who only want new, shiny things. This usually means less competition for you! You can do really well because others are busy with other stuff.

# The Problem: Doing One Thing and Waiting

Many businesses sell only one thing to a customer and then wait for the next customer. This is a bad idea from my exposure.

Imagine a thirsty, tired, and hungry man named John coming into a boring store. He wants water.

Most businesses would just sell him the water. They only make a little money from a bottle of water.

So how do we make more money? With a **value ladder**!

# The Value Ladder: Step Up Your Game

""What's a value ladder?"" you might ask.

It's simple: offer more things to your customers, and they'll pay more. It sounds easy, but there's a trick to doing it right.

Let's think about John again.

He goes to a regular store, buys water, and leaves. He's not thirsty, but he's still hungry and tired.

Now imagine John goes to a store that uses a value ladder (VL = Value laddered), Let's call it ""VL Store.""

In a VL Store business, we could add a large banner offering free cold water and a comfortable seating area. You might wonder, ""Why offer this for free when we could charge for it?""

The answer is simple: this serves as the first step to attracting customers.

If your business is similar to the one next door, **what would make John choose yours?** Maybe luck or proximity—but if he was coming from the other direction or if another competitor opened before you, that advantage disappears.

By providing a compelling reason for customers to walk through your doors, we create an edge that differentiates our business from the rest.

# Step One: The Free Gift

The first step should be simple and come with almost zero risk for your customers to engage with your business.

Not everyone who takes the first step will move on to the second or third, and that’s okay. **The goal is to attract as many people as possible to take that initial step**, as this naturally increases the likelihood that more will continue along the journey.

Even those who only take the first step **will remember your business** when they need the next level of value. **We’ll be the first name that comes to mind when they or their friends require your services**. **Why**?

Because people trust their own experiences—even small ones.

>

# Step Two: The Next Level of Engagement

A vending machine stocked with fresh products—but at a slightly higher price.

Note: charging extra at this stage isn’t always necessary; in some cases, you might even offer a discount. The key point here is understanding the psychology behind the next step.

**Why would someone pay extra on the next step when they could take your free offering and find a cheaper option elsewhere?** While it’s true they *could* do that, the real question is: ***Would they actually go through the effort?***

To minimize the chances of them seeking alternatives,

>

A few extra cents is often not enough of a difference for someone to walk a mile just to save money.

# Step Three: Helping More

John's drinking his water and resting. But he's still hungry. Now imagine VL Store also has sandwiches and coffee. etc….

This kind of store already exists in some places. But not everywhere! Have you seen two similar stores, one doing great and one not? The one doing great probably uses a better value ladder.

# Bonus Example

A gym typically offers subscriptions and personal training at a high fee. However, by structuring a value ladder, you can attract more customers and gradually guide them toward higher-value services.

# VL Gym

1. **Risk-Free Entry:** Offer a **3-day free trial** with a personal trainer and a **personalized plan**. This removes any risk for potential customers and allows them to experience your premium service. Even if they don’t sign up immediately, they’ll talk about their experience—driving word-of-mouth marketing, one of the most powerful forms of promotion.🔹 **Important Tip:** Don’t reveal the price of your premium offer at this stage. Let them experience the value first, so they hope it’s affordable rather than convincing themselves it’s not worth it.
2. **Standard Gym Subscription:** Provide a **regular gym membership** with flexible hours. To add more value, include an **AI-powered training app** for free.
3. **Group Training & Follow-ups:** Offer a **separate subscription** for group training sessions and periodic progress check-ins.
4. **Dedicated Personal Trainer:** Customers looking for more guidance can upgrade to a **one-on-one personal training plan**.
5. **Premium Offer:** The ultimate **gold package**—a **6-month dedicated training program** that includes **daily supplement and meal deliveries with precise doses**.🔹 **Risk Reversal:** If the customer **pays upfront for 6 months** and follows the plan but doesn’t achieve results, they get a **full money-back guarantee**.

She tries to get more and more hours (she gets an hourly rate) by talking bad things about me , saying things like “you can’t be alone at X hour because (me) will sleep until X hour” (which is not even true). She acts nice in my face but i often hear her talk shit about me when im in my room. 

We are not a family that is financially well-off, and at first we gave her some small things she can enjoy when she’s here, like a cup of coffee or some cookies/soup. But she always wants more and more, and even eats the whole jar empty in one sitting. We felt it was a bit disrespectful so we told her to buy her own food/drinks from then on.

My mom often calls my name to get her some coffee or make a small meal, and i never ask the woman if she wants something too because i think she’s just a trash human being, but unfortunately i can’t choose because we need her.

I wanted to make a post to explore the possibility of starting a small book club in our area! I’ve tried looking for some, but wasn’t sure how often or active they are so wanted to see if there was any interest in creating one.

I (24M) started reading more recently as my goal for 2025 and I have found it to be really exciting! I just wrapped up The Sun Also Rises and moving onto another book.

As I recently found a love for reading, what I think would really be nice is to find people like me to discuss these books with! I also think it’d be a nice way to connect with new people as social opportunities, as since moving here recently for work like many other people my age, find it a bit difficult to meet new people outside of work.

This could be a small book club where we meet bi-weekly or so at a local coffee shop or location to chat about whatever book we chose! My personal interests in books are all over the place (I have Why Nations Fail, Invisible Man, Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Slaughterhouse-Five, Poverty by America, and more on my bookshelf) so very much open to ideas and creating a list for us!

I’ve never done a book club before so this would be fun to organize for the first time! Overall, thanks for your time and feel free to comment/DM to express an interest in joining to get this going 📚",17,1738277626.0,Sunnyvale,8,0.95,False

oh the white part under the design is a radiator - it produces steam, so not a fire hazard. it's vent area is at an angle so steam won't come in direct contact with the detailing, so mold isn't a concern!

1ie00vu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ie00vu,Gamer Work Van,"After the previous gamer mini van and camper van videos, I thought people here might appreciate the ""gamer"" work van myself and a colleague built as part of a project for work. Rather than a normal monitor or even a sensible screen in the back, we built in a 270 degree curved screen driven by 3x 4k laser projectors.

The desk and screen are hard mounted with the PC, air-conditioning, mini fridge/freezer, air fryer, coffee machine and batteries all hidden away underneath. Behind the command chair, an array of shelves for storing joysticks, controllers and anything else you might need. Then moving towards the rear of the van is a shock mounted 3D printer so new parts can be printed whilst the van is on the move. All of the filament for the printer is in a heated dry box under the bench which features a fold out table with additional folding seats on the other side with an optional side folding standing desk. For connectivity there is a starlink terminal which I hope to replace with one of the flat mountable ones in the future so that it can be bolted to the roof alongside the 550w solar panel. 

As we have been using this as part of work, we have found things we have wanted to add and change about it, but overall, it has held up rather well and done the job nicely. For good measure, we even put in a nice steering wheel to help with immersion when driving.

Basically everything is plywood, some surfaces have a soft fabric ""carpet"" applied and the de-warping for the screen, is done in the projector rather than on the pc. I am aware of programs such as immersive display pro which will do a much better job, but that'll be an upgrade for the future. The PC has a threadripper and a 4090, and we swap it with an identical snow tower case which has a ryzen 9 and a 4090 when we want to be slightly more power efficient. 

If anyone has any ideas for additions or upgrades you recon will be worth adding, please comment below and I hope this will inspire others to build more gaming rigs for on the go because, at the end of the day, it's just a wooden frame with some silly planning.

This 20-inch expandable carry-on has been my go-to for business trips, weekend getaways, and even a chaotic family vacation. While it has plenty of upsides, there are a few quirks you should know about.

**Design & Build Quality**

This suitcase strikes a balance between being lightweight and durable, thanks to a combination of PC+ABS materials. The micro-diamond textured surface gives it a sleek look while also fending off scratches and scuffs during transit. Personally, I love the bold blue color—it’s eye-catching but not overly flashy. The build feels solid, and it holds up well even after being shoved into overhead compartments or accidentally dropped (oops).

[Check LEVEL8 Grace LA-6576 price on Amazon now.](https://bagsby.com/product-reviews/level8-grace-carry-on-luggage-review-b083px1tdl/)

**Wheels & Mobility**

The eight rubber-covered 360-degree spinner wheels are an absolute dream. These things glide smoothly over airport floors, bumpy sidewalks, and yes, even cobblestones. Dragging it behind me felt effortless, and I didn’t experience any wobbling, even when the suitcase was fully packed. Stability-wise, it’s a winner. I once rolled it across a crowded metro station with a coffee in one hand and a phone in the other—zero issues.

**Handles & Comfort**

The telescoping aluminum handle adjusts smoothly to multiple heights. It feels sturdy, though I have to admit I cringed hard during one incident where a fellow traveler grabbed it a little too aggressively. Luckily, it held up like a champ. The side and top handles are well-padded and make it easy to lift the bag onto overhead racks or into car trunks, but be prepared for some minor strain if the bag is fully loaded.

**Security Features**

TSA-approved locks on both the main compartment and the front laptop pocket are a nice touch. The zippers glide easily and feel robust, but I did notice a slight misalignment on one corner after overstuffing the bag—it was my fault, but something to note if you tend to pack like you're moving house.

**Organization & Compartments**

One word: efficient. This suitcase is a masterclass in packing organization. The front laptop compartment is a standout feature—I could slip my 15.6-inch laptop in and out without opening the main compartment. It’s a lifesaver during security checks. Internally, the suitcase is divided into two main sections with zippered dividers and elastic straps to keep everything in place. The expandable design adds an extra 1.57 inches of width, bumping the capacity from 36 to 42 liters. Packing for a two-week trip? Totally doable if you’re strategic.

**Durability**

After months of use, the suitcase still looks almost new, save for a few scuffs around the wheels. Even after being checked during a rainstorm, the outer shell held up, though water did seep in slightly around the zippers. Long-term reliability seems promising, but it’s better suited for carry-on use than being tossed around by baggage handlers.

**Water Resistance**

While the suitcase’s materials are inherently water-resistant, the zippers are a weak point. During that aforementioned rainstorm, my clothes near the zipper got damp. A quick tip: consider a weatherproof cover if you’re traveling during monsoon season or through particularly wet regions.

**Pros**

* Lightweight yet sturdy construction.
* Smooth 360-degree spinner wheels.
* TSA locks on both compartments.
* Excellent organization with laptop-friendly front pocket.
* Stylish and scratch-resistant design.

**Cons**

* Slight water seepage through zippers in heavy rain.
* Handle mechanism feels less robust under excessive strain.
* Limited space in the front pocket if the main compartment is overpacked.
* Not the lightest carry-on available.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to brands like Samsonite and Travelpro, the LEVEL8 Grace LA-6576 holds its own in terms of style and functionality. The Samsonite Freeform, for example, is slightly lighter but lacks the laptop compartment and doesn’t feel as sturdy during rough handling. Travelpro’s Platinum Elite line offers smoother zippers and better water resistance but comes at a significantly higher price point. If you’re after a good balance of features and affordability, LEVEL8 is a solid middle ground.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Considering its durable build, smart design, and features like TSA locks and a laptop compartment, this suitcase punches above its weight in terms of value. While it’s not the cheapest carry-on out there, it’s certainly worth the investment if you’re a frequent traveler looking for something reliable. The slightly heavier weight might be a dealbreaker for some, but the trade-off in durability and functionality makes it worthwhile.
