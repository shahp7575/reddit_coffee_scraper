Page 395 names Iqbal Singh Mann a fool who stood in his fields in the summer of ‘47, waiting for the harvest to fall due in three days. “He mistook yield for destiny,” the records say, and beside his name a ‘seven’ marks the days before a pen in a distant room dragged a line across a map, and doomed his estate.


Iqbal snapped a stalk and listened to the Gurbani playing on a distant radio that concealed the clearances beyond his borders, where intelligence notes reduced the commotion to codes—QNL(Qaafirs No Longer)-425 for the men, WRA(Women Raped and Abducted)-287 for the women—while entire villages were redacted as ‘unviable.’ But Iqbal was merely concerned with the survival of the serfs of his water, for he was the warden of their thirst. Records from the 1830s state that the Manns arrived on injured horses with insufficient provisions. Royal decrees name a Daulat Singh Mann—likely his great-grandfather—who was granted the Lyallpur tract after the Kasur conquest, with a page dated 5 May 1839 annotating the Mann brothers as cholera casualties, and their sons as malaria losses. 


Iqbal had barely walked a few steps when Karim Baksh emerged with his bahi-khaata. ""The cutters,"" he whispered. ""They ask about rates, Sarkaar."" Iqbal straightened his kurta and took Karim’s shawl from his shoulders, then cleaned his shoes with it. ""One in twenty,"" he said. Karim Baksh looked at him, then at his shoes. ""Virk… janaab… offers one in eighteen,"" he said. Iqbal let the stalks fall from his palm. ""Let Virk feed them into debt. Here, they eat what they earn.” Karim Baksh finished the cleaning and still kept his eyes on the ground. “Sarkaar, we’ll lose people.” Iqbal smiled a little and draped the muddy shawl on him. “Let's walk home, Karimeya.""


The records merely tell of a mansion a kilometre away, as the interim conversation stands without notation. Beneath it—annotated—is ‘Mann Haveli’. Separate from acreage and canal rotations, the haveli carried the true meaning of power. It was books and granary, nursery and court, and the only refuge when the five rivers turned to holy scriptures and swords. While men came to it to settle debts, arrange marriages, and surrender daughters, women came to it for verdicts no magistrate would sign. While it fed the quarter in ordinary seasons, it judged them without petitions during the extraordinary ones. The haveli kept order, and order demanded its own atrocities. Clerks wrote it as stability, poets as inheritance, enemies as arrogance, and heirs as burden. In time, history would decide which description was closest to the truth. 


As they entered the threshold, Karim went to his office and Iqbal into the courtyard where his father, Sardar Jaswant Singh, sat on his charpai, seventy-three years of command had left whom with one eye and the stillness of a man who had ruled by the sword and never bowed to a British command. ""The wheat, puttar?"" Jaswant rasped. ""Three days,"" Iqbal replied without bowing. ""And the village?"" Jaswant continued. Iqbal clenched his fists. ""It holds… for now… b—bapuji. Tomorrow it may not."" he said. Jaswant pulled him close by clamping onto his forearm. ""My father built this with loyalty. My grandfather bought this dirt with blood rendered to Ranjit Singh’s shaahi furmaans, and I defended it with petitions and the white man’s courts. But that time is done, Iqbal. It’s done."" The grip tightened. ""You will require fire, son. The law is dead. We collect the ashes now."" Jaswant’s words reminded Iqbal of a tenant who had stolen water—records date it 1936—and of his wife pleading until dusk, while Sukhdev—a child then—asked about mercy. Iqbal had answered with words that split the house: Mercy is for the God who sends the rain. I’m a man who digs the ditch.


Sukhdev entered the courtyard and broke Iqbal’s thoughts. He is depicted as a nineteen-year-old ink-handed boy who was a creature of another species, unaware of the dirt beneath land diagrams. ""I was at the library, Papaji"" he said. ""What do books know of the thirst that drives a man to kill his brother, Sukhdev?"" Iqbal replied. ""Systems they say,"" Sukhdev murmured. ""It teaches how everything flows."" Iqbal studied him as he would a field. ""Systems? Flow? Haha! This land listens to a hand and obeys the grip. Macaulay has made y’all impotent."" Jaswant roared. “Stop,” he said. “You think of the throne, Iqbal. The boy will conquer the world.” The records dispute the prophecy. Iqbal’s brow hardened and Sukhdev bowed lower. Jaswant beheld no successor and looked away.


A shivering servant with cutlery and stationery broke the silence. Iqbal kept tea aside and opened the envelope bearing the Deputy Commissioner’s seal, a luxurious insult. Chief Guest: Tariq Ali Khan. Annexure 3 to page 397 speaks of him as a lawyer whose speeches unstitched districts. ""Hunters and prey at the same table,"" Iqbal murmured while his one hand crumpled the paper. ""Davies Sahib miscalculates the cost of his civility."" He handed the letter to Karim. ""Send word to Lahore. I want everything said about this man in the coffee houses. And find out what Virk mutters when gin nears empty."" Karim vanished, and Iqbal sat alone in the dead air of the diwan-khana. The irrigation figures swam before him—one in twenty, one in eighteen—soon to be meaningless. He oiled his gun while a lizard stalked a fly across the whitewashed wall. The fly did not know it was already dead. 


When patience ran out, he stood and walked toward the Zenana—haveli’s women’s chambers—where the air was scented with rosewater that couldn't quite mask the smell of gunpowder coming from—haveli’s men’s chambers—the Mardana. Gurmeet, Iqbal’s wife, sat before her mirror, unbraiding her hair. Iqbal stood in the doorway, and kept watching her, still the girl he had married twenty years ago, as his mouth almost uttered a praise and then stopped. For a long while, he watched in silence, then walked over and placed his hands on her shoulders. She leaned back into him as her eyes closed. ""Are you afraid?"" she whispered, covering his hand with hers. Iqbal rested his chin on her head. ""Terrified,"" he confessed to the mirror, a word he would never speak outside this room. ""If the water stops, Gurmeet… I don't know who I am without the water.” Neither did she answer, nor did he wait for her to. He kissed her forehead and left like a river that would perish if stagnated. By the time the shadows stretched long across the courtyard, the air grew poisonous from the burning villages in the neighbouring estates. Manns and Manns’ were safe, for now. And Iqbal knew that one can only save his own. God bless the rest. 


As morning bled into noon, Karim returned with a note that was heavy as a tombstone. Iqbal opened it, and eight words changed his expression into a dead man’s: The dinner is a trap. Virk is involved. The facade had collapsed, and the game was ceremonial no longer. ""Call the headmen,"" Iqbal commanded. He then walked to the armory where Sukhdev sat under the lamplight with a book sagging in his hands. ""Come,"" Iqbal said. He moved to the wall where the old but functioning rifles hung. ""Do you know how to shoot?"" Iqbal asked. Sukhdev shook his head. Iqbal picked a rifle and placed it into his hands. Their fingers brushed as the iron will that had carried a grandfather through the cholera pits passed between them. ""Listen,"" Iqbal said. ""This is not a debate. Hold past comfort. Empty the lungs. Ease the trigger. Accept the recoil and let it mark you. That is the price of life."" He left him there with Kalola Singh. The drill lasted three hours, leaving the boy exhausted with bruised shoulders and ringing ears. He was no longer a spectator, for he knew how to end a life, even if his hands shook when he thought about it.


By nightfall, the headmen—hard men with eyes fixed on the storm—gathered beneath the sky. Iqbal stood before them like a Sardar bracing for hell. ""The British leave,"" he said in a thunderous voice. ""Men who have never stepped on our soil redraw it in a room in Delhi. Some of you may wake up in a new country. Some of you may not wake at all."" He let the silence carry its omen. ""Tonight, this remains Mann land. Because I say it does. Because my blood is in this mud,” His throat opposed, but he still roared with an unmatched intensity. “My ancestors bled for it under Abdali. We survived drought and plague. When the morning comes, the wheat will stand. The canal will run. And I will be here. Hold to that."" Opposition was impossible, for men who have absolute dependence retain only the privilege of obedience. He didn't wait for them to bid their allegiance and walked away.


He climbed to the haveli roof as the evening slipped into darkness. Gurmeet found him in the shadows, smoking his imported cigars, as wind caught her dupatta. ""It has begun,"" she whispered. Iqbal didn't turn. He watched the sky where the night was bleeding orange. ""Yes."" he said. She smiled for a second then returned to her grim composure. ""The women ask,"" she said. ""Muslims ask of Lahore. Hindus of Delhi. They do not ask of the harvest anymore."" He looked at her then. ""And what do you tell them?"" he asked. ""That they have nothing to be afraid of. The Mann land is stone,"" she said. ""But stone cracks, Iqbal. I cannot expect them to trust my word."" He took her cold hands. ""Then we mortar it with blood. And no drop of ours will be spilt into waste.” 


Iqbal looked south. Across the black expanse, Kot Ramchand was burning. It was an angry orange scar tearing open the night. The cries of helpless women, and laughs of men led astray, were in itself a statement that the men who had reddened the streets of Calcutta had arrived. But from the flames, cloaked in shadow, the estates of Virk lay untouched. The harvest had begun. Three days was a myth. The Mann Estate wouldn't be one. Or it would. Records know what Iqbal didn't. They won't lie.

How do I push for a differential diagnosis beyond standard Hemochromatosis?","I am seeking insight on a ""High Iron / Normal Ferritin"" mismatch that is concurrent with secondary hypogonadism symptoms. Despite being only an H63D Heterozygote, I have persistent hyper-saturation of transferrin that contradicts my genotype and lifestyle.

Key Lab Findings (Jan/Feb 2026):

Iron Status:

• Transferrin Saturation: 81% (Ref: 15–57%).  

• Serum Iron: 43.2 µmol/L (Ref: 9–34).  

• Ferritin: 151 µg/L (Ref: 20–300). Note: Ferritin has remained stable in the 100-150 range for 5 years.  

• TIBC: Normal (53 µmol/L).  

Genetics:

• HFE: Heterozygous H63D / C282Y Normal.  

• Pathologist's Note: ""Genotype not associated with HFE-hemochromatosis... \[However\] Persistent high transferrin saturation and ferritin may indicate iron deposition from other causes... The patient should in such cases be assessed by a specialist."".  

Hormones (Concurrent):

• Testosterone: 10 nmol/L (Ref: 8–35) — Low end of normal.  

• Estradiol: 0.17 nmol/L — Upper limit of normal.  

• SHBG: 17 nmol/L — Low end.  

• Symptoms: Chronic fatigue, erectile dysfunction (since age 18), joint pain (specifically in the hands/knuckles), and heart flutter.  

Lifestyle Factors:

• I drink 5–6 cups of coffee daily (which should inhibit iron absorption).  

• I consume very little red meat and no fortified cereals.  

• No alcohol abuse (<5 units/month).  

The Conflict:

My GP sees the normal Ferritin (151) and the ""mild"" H63D heterozygous status and is hesitant to refer to Hematology. However, the lab pathologist explicitly noted that the persistent saturation (81%) warrants specialist assessment for non-HFE causes or other iron deposition issues.

My Questions for the Community:

1. Clinical Significance: Does a TSAT of 81% with normal Ferritin indicate ""Early Iron Loading"" (where tissue damage occurs before ferritin rises), or does it point toward ineffective erythropoiesis (recycling blockage)?

2. Next Steps: To justify the referral to my GP, what specific ""Rule Out"" tests should I request? (e.g., Soluble Transferrin Receptor, Ceruloplasmin, Liver MRI/FerriScan?)

3. Differential Diagnosis: Apart from Ferroportin Disease, what else fits this specific phenotype of High Serum Iron + High Saturation + Normal Ferritin + Low Testosterone?",1,1770451014.0,u_east0fwest,0,1.0,False

**Living with Chloe: A Character Study**

You haven't lived until you've had a roommate like Chloe.

That morning, she stumbled into the kitchen, tripping over a pile of pizza boxes from god-knows-when. There was a traffic cone on the kitchen table. No explanation, no context—just a traffic cone, like it had always belonged there.

""Morning roomie!"" she grinned. ""Hey, so, funny story. I kinda borrowed your car last night to go to a rave in the desert, and I think I lost the keys? Also, we're out of milk.""

Before I could even start processing the absolute chaos of that sentence, she tossed me the traffic cone.

""It's not much, but hey! It's a cone-tribution to your day!"" She cackled at her own joke.

I stood there, holding a traffic cone, processing the fact that my car was keyless somewhere in the desert. ""Can you at least get the spares?""

""On it, on it!"" She spun around, her oversized pajama bottoms flopping around her feet as she bolted to the living room. Thirty seconds later, she came back—not with keys, but with a beer she'd pulled from the couch cushions.

""We don't have milk but we have beer in the furniture?"" I asked.

She grabbed a megaphone from... somewhere... and climbed onto the couch. ""Today? Today we're having a spontaneous rooftop party! Trust me on this, buddy. Nothing good will ever come from you getting to work.""

And then things got weird.

She threw her phone out the window. A raven caught it. She chased the raven with a lighter, setting pizza boxes on fire in the process. At some point, the traffic cone ended up on her head, and she was doing what I can only describe as a ""rain dance for higher powers.""

""Did you smoke crack this morning?"" I finally asked.

""Don't get rude about it! We were out of milk, remember?""

The logic was flawless, somehow.

By the time she suggested we get a trampoline (""We could hop on the tram or hop on the trampoline—either way, we'll be flying!""), I'd already accepted that work wasn't happening.

Living with Chloe meant never making it anywhere on time. It meant traffic cones as furniture. It meant questioning reality before coffee. But it also meant never being bored, never taking life too seriously, and always having a story worth telling.

Was she hungover that morning? High? Having some kind of spiritual awakening? All three? I never found out.

But I've never regretted missing work that day.

This veracity has to be automatic and open along with attribution if being used by another person/agent.

This requirement can be fulfilled by a blockchain which is a distributed immutable ledger of the data being created by the agent or person.

[Blockchain for Veracity vs Privacy !](https://preview.redd.it/n0xu800g21ig1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1030b577f07c21253eb7eb9ab99cfb5d70dc867b)

One of the most important issue with this is privacy. While veracity of the data is good, people want to share the data privately and only with select persons but blockchain has the data publicly available to everyone for maintaining its immutability. Hence, we are experimenting with the concept of encrypted payloads in which certain parts of the payload is encrypted and will be available only to the owner or persons allowed for a specific timeframe.

This allows a person say a manufacturer to upload details of its supply chain on permissioned blockchain to create an immutable ledger with time eg if an organic producer of coffee could capture from the time of purchase of the seeds by three layer downstream farmer, its harvesting, processing, storing and further transportation as and when its happening and make the data available to its customers. A fraudulent person won't be able to mimic the entire supply chain, transport, processing in which multiple players are involved and each one updating the product which finally get consumed to form a new product. 

**The value added to the supply chain by preserving the authenticity of the product can be shared by all the partners and give an authentic value-for-money product to the end consumer.**

Descriptive Writing

Write a description with the title, ‘A sunny day in a town or city’.



“A sunny day in a town or city”



The sleepy town of Bronzeville stretched in the wash of early daylight. The air was cool and heavy with morning dew. The children skittered like ants along the winding roads on their bicycles, determined to get the most out of this day. Stretches of pastel tulips and daisies carpeted the expansive fields of Bronzeville. The sun crawled up the baby blue sky— slowly but surely. The cotton clouds parted like curtains for its genial radiance. The town lit up in gold, a certain promise of a satisfying day. 



I glance at the nest of blue robins. A bird wakes, its beady eyes blinked slowly, taking in the glorious morning. Its wings sprawled out, glossy sapphire feathers fluttering in a gentle breeze. The robin chirped, singing its mirthful song, as if it was a serenade to the wondrous weather. Another blue robin swooped down to the nest, landing on its edge— a few pieces of twine crumble off to the grass below. In its mouth was a bundle of wriggling earthworms, the baby birds in the nest snap their beaks hungrily like alligators. 



I settle further into my armchair in content. 



The breeze disturbs a wind chime, it gleamed in the sunlight. Its melodic twinkle graces my ears, its music like the plucking of an angel’s harp. The wind chime undulated like an ocean’s wave; hypnotic and dreamy. The wind chime returns to stillness when the wind passes, evidence of the tranquility of the air. It glints like a weapon when the sun grows stronger. It sways lightly, in rhythm with the rocking of my chair. 



I watch swirls of white steam rise from my latte. Nutty notes of freshly roasted coffee beans permeate the air, calling me to take another sip. The bitter scent masks the real sugary identity of the drink. The surface of the cup is a light brown, an intricate pattern made with milk decorates it like a tattoo. It glistens as the strong light hits it, appearing even more tantalising— like sweet divine ambrosia. It almost glows golden when the sun rises overhead. 



A dark cloud approaches the sun like a predator— careful and dangerous. I straighten in my chair at the sight of it. In an abrupt move, it enshrouds the sun like it was a rabbit in a snare trap. The sky dims to a shade of miserable grey, and the town darkens somberly. A pack of more clouds appear, dark with torrential rain— a clear threat. A single fat drop of rain hits my nose. Then, rain drops fall like gunfire. The laundry on clothing lines dampens as well as everybody’s mood.

I recently went on holiday for 1 week and I decided just before it to try and stop caffeine as as well as my ADHD meds. My bloating completely disappeared. Now I’m back I’ve started coffee again and I’m so bloated I can barely function. It doesn’t start straight after a coffee but comes after eating later on - I usually have a coffee on its own for “breakfast”. Can coffee be the cause of this? From my trip away it would seem that yes it is but I did go to Thailand for 9 months and drank a lot of coffee and my bloating also disappeared. I’m wondering if coffee is almost simulating “stress” in my gut, if that’s possible? And in Thailand I wasn’t working so this fake stress didn’t affect me as much. ",1,1770450635.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1qy7vvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1qy7vvp/ios_after_6_months_of_solo_nights_weekends/,"[iOS] After 6 months of solo nights & weekends, finally launched my task/daily planner app with features I couldn't find anywhere else","Hey there 👋

Just hit submit on the App Store after 6 months of building MindDraft - an AI-powered task app that actually understands context and location.

**The backstory:** Started this because I kept walking past grocery stores while getting ""buy groceries"" reminders at home. Tried every app - Todoist, Things, TickTick, Notion. They all expected ME to organize perfectly. By the time I set up a task properly, I'd forgotten 3 more.

**What I built differently:**

🗣️ **Voice AI that gets it** \- ""Call mom tomorrow, it's her birthday next week"" → perfect task + context + subtask for gift   
  
📍 **Location-aware reminders** \- ""Buy groceries"" alerts when you're near ANY grocery store, not at 5pm when you're home  
  
📞 **Smart Actions** \- Tasks have action buttons. ""Call dentist"" → tap → calling. ""Visit bank"" → tap → Maps opens  
  
 💳 **Auto expense tracking** \- Complete ""Buy coffee $5"" → automatically logged as expense   
  
⌚ **Full Apple Watch app** \- Add tasks by voice, complete from wrist.

**Tech stack:**

* SwiftUI + SwiftData (bet on Apple's latest)
* Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
* Vertex AI for natural language processing
* RevenueCat for subscriptions
* Native iOS only (no cross-platform compromise)

**The grind:**

* 500+ commits across 6 months
* Rewrote the location logic 4 times (iOS geofencing is tricky)
* Spent 1 month just on AI prompt engineering
* Cut 40% of planned features to ship something people would actually use

**Business model:**

* Freemium - core features free forever
* Premium: $4.99/month or $39.99/year (advanced views, unlimited AI, analytics)
* No ads, ever

**Current status:**

* Live on App Store for a week
* 847 downloads (organic only)
* $50 MRR from early adopters
* Product Hunt launch done recently

**Hardest parts:**

1. **Scope creep** \- Almost built a full calendar app at one point
2. **AI reliability** \- Getting consistent task parsing took forever
3. **iOS location permissions** \- Users are (rightfully) paranoid
4. **Marketing** \- Harder than coding by far

**What I learned:**

* Ship ugly and iterate (my v1 looked terrible)
* Real users give better feedback than friends/family
* One killer feature beats 10 mediocre ones
* Revenue validation > download numbers

**Celebrating by giving away free premium:** First 50 people to try it and DM feedback get 1 month premium free. Genuinely want to know what works/doesn't work.

**Questions for the community:**

* What's worked for your app marketing?
* Any advice on converting free → premium users?
* Worth building Android version or double down on iOS?

1qy7u8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1qy7u8z/my_roomate_is_turning_crazy_and_i_dont_know_how/,My roomate is turning crazy and I don’t know how to deal with it anymore.,"So, for reference she’s my best friend of almost 10 years, begged me to be her roomate because she didn’t wanna live with strangers, i refused multiple times and said I would hangout with her everyday but wouldn’t move out of my current room, fast forward I caved in and decided to give it a try because after all she’s my best friend right ? So after that I should mention that she’s a VERY rich person, like filthy rich and would literally excessively buy groceries for both of us unasked, I would of course bring WHATEVER I could afford, pantries, spices, cheese, biscuits, anything I can afford really. But she goes overtop with grocery shopping and she would insist on me eating from what she cooks and while I didn’t use to cook everyday because my dorm provides free food she would, and wouldn’t accept me just going to the dorms restraunt, despite me saying it’s okay and she doesn’t have to multiple times, but she insisted and so i figured since I can’t pay her with money, I just proposed that I would do the dishes every single time she cooks, and we agreed on that and our first year was manageable it wasn’t perfect because I was obviously going through so much physical labour compared to her but it was meh. Fast forward to our 2nd and current year, I’m a senior now, this girl would sit her butt down all day, scrolling through reels full volume with no regard for me, never attend classes. Ever. All she does is take care of her appearance and eats and sleeps, she would leave her mess all around the room including my space, would leave food crumbs all over the counter and MY table, would leave the makeup counter looking absolutely horrendous after every. Single. Use. Would bring a shit ton of heavy winter coats that she never uses and would leave them scattered all around the room untidy, unfolded, so now after 6 hours of studying I come to my room to a view that makes me want to go right back out. This girl would leave wipes with mysterious wetness on them, her dirty panties scattered all around the laundry bin, her wet smelly socks everywhere, and the worst part are the dishes. This girl got SO comfortable with my proposal to do the dishes now every single dish in that room is somehow my responsibility, she would use my dishes and just leave them for days and days and days, she would cook something and not slightly help, keep in mind that I attend every class I could and this girl NEVER DOES so she’s free 24/7 literally free all day and all she does is sleep, I managed to ignore this because I was grateful for her spending grocery money on me but it got so heavy I started feeling like a maid instead, I wake up everyday at 6 am, attend 8am-4pm classes all while she’s still alseep, I go back to my room, automatically start picking up her clothes, cleaning the makeup table, picking up her trash from the floor, oh and I forgot to mention that she also leaves food bits on the counter AND the floor. I would start picking up empty water bottles and taking them out, would also clean the dishes SHE used for coffee etc, and by the time I get to relax it’s already 7-8 pm. Day gone. Just like that. But I was managing until- and this is the straw the broke the camels back- she started having her friend over, and by over i mean overnight stays, they would cook together, and I would clean the dishes because both of them are playing oblivious, and now with her friend around, DOUBLE THE MESS AND GIVE IT TO ME. It got so so so bad to the point where I literally couldn’t walk around the room without stumbling on some kind of trash anymore. Fast forward I sat my roomate down and talked to her about the situation. I said the friend is not welcome anymore when I’m around, if she wants to have her over it should be when I leave, and the mess they create together is their responsibility not mine, and she took it so badly, she got defensive and accused me of exaggerating and overreacting because according to her "" my friend does help clean! She cleaned this one time where you were out blah blah blah "" I made my boundary clear and just told her to take care of her shit. After that I stopped eating with her, started eating alone and doing everything alone and when she includes me in groceries I would just let it rot, didn’t do her dishes anymore and instead of doing them herself she would just wash whatever she needs at the time. her friend stopped coming over when I’m in the room but would sleep over when I’m for example at home, last weekend I went to my room after they slept over together and my room looked ATROCIOUS to say the less, food on the floor is all I’m gonna say. So of course like the maid I’m playing I had to clean it up myself because you can never compete with a filthy person because filth is THEIR ELEMENT. After that I found a shit ton of dishes they had used to make dinner the previous night and I had to wash some of them to make my own food but now all of this is making me feel so small. And before you suggest me talking to her about it this girl would never listen, she literally doesn’t go home to avoid helping her mom clean so that tells you what kind of person she is 🤷🏻‍♀️. Sorry for how lonw this is but what would Y’all do in a situation like this? And moving out is not an option because I talked to my dorms administration and they told me to wait until the beginning of next year before that.",2,1770450386.0,roommateproblems,0,1.0,False

At twenty five, she is hustling and struggling to establish herself as a journalist, currently on field duties and so, her work takes her places. On some days, she is talking about the problem of potholes in Mumbai, on others she is interviewing people of Delhi about the issues they have been facing because of the increasing pollution and on other days, she is reporting about the military operations and tensions in Kashmir. But she loves what she does and so, more often than not, she is happy to be where she is.

It's not a pop hit. It's not a ""banger"" like most of you kids say. You don't have to like it. I don't think it's dogshit either. So don't impose that it is dogshit down onto other peoples' throats. Don't dogpile on someone who claims to like it. Liking it doesn't necessarily mean it's dickriding. None of you can accept having different opinions over something as simple as music of all things.

I still vividly recall having an intense dislike for BALLADS when it first came out, having just been way too accustomed to Pink Guy stuff. Then the songs grew onto me and I accepted it as ""yeah this is what George sounds like"".

If you dislike reading, my TL;DR is that this is an album you listen from Track 1 to Track 21 in one sitting. It's something you would play in the background of a hang out with the homies on a Friday night and cracking cold ones with them. Or maybe you play this entire album during a midnight drive hopping from city to city with a bunch of friends. This album sounds like the songs made by a cool old friend and he wanted to share it to us. Bro isn't looking for a pop hit, he just wants to shit it out for his friends to hear. I imagine me and my friends just hanging out... then LOVE YOU LESS plays and we all get silent for a moment just to emotionally resonate.

The entire album is an amalgamation of Chloe Burbank Vol. 1, in tongues, BALLADS, Nectar, Smithereens. It takes everything Joji must have liked and made something experimental.

1. PIXELATED KISSES - Really good track. We've heard it many times for a while now, being out before the album released. Nice crunchy and angry sound. Great contrast to how calm the rest of the album is.
2. Cigarette - A way more melancholic ""Thom"", subtler melodies but it sets a mood. Something that would play in my head on a gloomy rainy day with coffee on my table and, well, a cigarette in my hand. The title perfectly encapsulates the emotion the song is trying to convey.
3. Last of a Dying Breed - I don't get why some people don't think this track is mediocre. It sounds like a sequel to Gimme Love, something more victorious as if he was finally given the love he asked for. 
4. LOVE YOU LESS - Hands down my favorite track in the album and one I've endlessly played daily ever since it was released. It has all the emotions I want from a title like ""LOVE YOU LESS"". This song reeks of hopelessness, desperation, expectation, setting up one's self for disappointment. From that, Joji is trying to shake it off as if he doesn't care that his love is being reciprocated and goes about the song in denial. The guitars sound like they want to be some sort of happy Hawaiian paradise but they're played in a way as if paradise is trying you give you blue balls. 
5. If It Only Gets Better - It sounds like a follow up to Yeah Right. The prior is raw denial and coping, this track sounds like it has fully accepted the state of affairs. I don't see why a track like this needs to have more intricate lyricism. I treat this entire album as an entire story and this track only needs to deliver a few lines to convey a portion of that story.
6. Love Me Better - Nothing significant to say here other than it's another song to move a story forward. It's short, sweet, catchy. 
7. Piece of You - Gives me a really strong Chloe Burbank feel, particularly Besidju.
8. Hotel California - Reminds me of Afterthought but if it was released from in tongues EP. Think Bitter Fuck, but with more melancholy.
9. Tarmac - Nothing outstanding but not necessarily terrible. I remember in Chloe Burbank it had a lot of filler tracks. Just this time, Joji likes to sing over his filler tracks. As for the emotion this track conveys, it reeks of indifference. 
10. Forehead Touch the Ground - If you told me this track came from an unreleased track that was made between Chloe Burbank and in tongues, I'd believe you.
11. Past Won't Leave My Bed - We've heard this song for a while now. We all know it's a great song. I don't think we've heard anything like it from Joji before. This song makes me feel nostalgic about things that could have been, or things that were. It reeks of yearning and euphoria. Loud memories that quietly circulate in your head in the middle of 3AM. A persistent little worm that tells you ""Don't forget."" I quite like this sound from Joji... it sounds like a pop rock ballad
12. Fade to Black - Another filler song with the same kind of intent as other filler songs where it just tries to move a story along like intermissions to a theater performance.
13. CAN'T SEE SHIT IN THE CLUB - Definitely the Demons of this album. If in Demons, the demons in your head are persistently making noise in a quiet space--the demons in your head are getting drowned out by the overwhelming sound and crowd of the club. 
14. Sojourn - bro. My other favorite next to PIXELATED KISSES and LOVE YOU LESS. Sounds nothing like his earlier work and I definitely want more of this. This song evokes a state of clarity and realization. I'm already excited to have this play on a long highway drive in the middle of 2AM. 
15. DYKILY - Hey hot take, I prefer this over the first version from back then. It fits the pacing of the album better. This track evokes a sense of revelation and acceptance as the drums try to move you forward as if to hastily get over it. He's still reminiscing, but it sounds like ""well, that's all folks""
16. Rose Colored - Sounds like another in tongues song. I haven't heard of Yeat before and I thought he was fine in this track. Yeat's portions kinda give me a slight ODETARI feel which I like in the first place. I suppose I can understand why some people may not enjoy this as much but fortunately I quite like it. 
17. Silhouette Man - Nothing much to say about this track.
18. Fragments - Hah, somehow the bass reminds me of some Pink Guy tracks. I quite like this track. It just sounds catchy, but no particular emotion other than it tells a story of a memory.
19. Horses to Water - Like 17#, not a lot to say. Sounds like another intermission track and the beat kinda sounds like Peanutbutter.
20. Strange Home - Ditto.
21. Dior - It just ends the album, but that's pretty much it. 

Is the album a hit and miss? Nah. It's just different. Feels more melancholic. As if Joji just wanted to sing some frustrations out to clear his head and felt like sharing those frustrations to us. I don't think any of the songs are skippable. They build up to more bigger songs like LOVE YOU LESS and Past Won't Leave My Bed.

Likewise whether you enjoyed each song or not I believe your feedback still matters and is valuable criticism that Joji could learn from. Overall, it's another album I can listen to when I get tired of the other albums. Let's be real, you all have skipped songs in each of his albums and that's kinda normal. You're picking favorites and throwing them into a playlist anyway. 

Just as the album name implies, all of the songs tell the story about pissing in the wind where Joji (in the lyrics) feel like his efforts have been futile. 

I sincerely believe that you really can't evaluate art numerically. If you like it, you like it. Simple as that. You can analyze something on a technical standpoint but it won't change the fact that you like or dislike it. Something can be a complete masterpiece of a production but you don't like it just because it doesn't speak to you.

Anyways, off to loop Sojourn again.",2,1770450328.0,Joji,0,1.0,False

1qy7qv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/1qy7qv1/blockchain_for_veracity_vs_privacy/,Blockchain for Veracity vs Privacy !,"In this era of ever exploding data, with AI increasing it exponentially, it is now much more pertinent to ascertain the veracity of the data - be it generated by an AI agent or a natural person. This veracity has to be automatic and open along with attribution, if being used by another person/agent.

This requirement can be fulfilled by a blockchain which is a distributed immutable ledger of the data being created by the agent or person.

[](https://preview.redd.it/blockchain-for-veracity-vs-privacy-v0-phcilocuy0ig1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1933baa5a1d45da349bc54177a1dab5523f7f47c)

One of the most important issue with this is privacy. While veracity of the data is good, people want to share the data privately and only with select persons but blockchain has the data publicly available to everyone for maintaining its immutability. Hence, at HyperLog we have introduced the concept of encrypted payloads in which certain parts of the payload is encrypted and will be available only to the owner or persons allowed for a specific timeframe.

This allows a person say a manufacturer to upload details of its supply chain on HyperLog to create an immutable ledger with time eg if an organic producer of coffee could capture from the time of purchase of the seeds by three layer downstream farmer, its harvesting, processing, storing and further transportation as and when its happening and make the data available to its customers. A fraudulent person won't be able to mimic the entire supply chain, transport, processing in which multiple players are involved and each one updating the product which finally get consumed to form a new product.

Similarly, say a builder whose project has a large gestation period and after which the flats are being sold can meticulously capture the developent of the flat on HyperLog eg the purchase of the doors and windows, electricity fitments, plumbing fitments, kitchen equipments, tiles etc could be sourced through HyperLog which connects the purchase to its manufacturer. The final user then have all the details of the house and its maintenance requirements.

The explosion of posts on Instagram, X and others also points out the problem that veracity of the digital content and its attribution is important. The network of interaction of a person/agent on HyperLog generates a score called HyperScore which denotes the veracity of the digital content.

For a business enterprise, HyperLog can be implemented as a closed blockchain in which data insertion is being done by the approved partners while the veracity checking can be done by the consumers online. This not only improves the trust in the product but also increase the supply chain visibility, getting to know the problems before the raw material lands at your doorstep.

For general public, HyperLog maintains a main-net also in which general public can also insert data blocks - which may or may not be encrypted. It could also be used as an inventory for general public where their goods receive enterprise level inventory tooling and a verifiable ledger if they want to sell it again.",1,1770450048.0,BlockchainStartups,1,1.0,False

Mostly started in the last year or so. They're not full-fledged cafes, more like spots for a quick snack, unique chai, and a long sit without burning a hole in your pocket.

Here's a list I've compiled from exploring. Please add yours!

  
**On Prominent Road Corners & Main Lane Junctions**

*These are the most visible, often at the intersection of two lanes.*

* **Bae's Brews & Bites:** Corner of 1st A Cross and 1st Main (near CMH Hospital side). Known for flavored coffees, loaded fries, and a tiny sit-down ledge.
* **Nook & Corner:** At the junction of 100ft Road and a side lane (near Toit). Focus on artisan tea, bun maska, and grilled sandwiches. Very Instagrammable.
* **The Paratha Box (Multiple Corners):** A mini-chain that has popped up. One notable spot is on 12th Main near the mosque. Quick, customizable parathas and chai.
* **Chai Git:** Corner spots near 6th Main and 5th Cross. As the name suggests, chai is the hero, with a side of poetry on the walls and basic snacks.

# Inside Residential Lanes (The Hidden Finds)

*These are the true residential lane surprises, often in converted porches or tiny independent spaces.*

* **Happiness Cafe:** Tucked inside a lane off 7th Main (near Sri Satya Sai School). Very small, with 2-3 tables. Known for waffles, hot chocolate, and a quiet vibe.
* **The Baker's Dozen (Pop-up Sits):** Not a cafe, but many of their outlets (like the one on 2nd Cross) now have a single bench or two where people sit with their pastries and coffee for hours.
* **Doodle Cafe:** Inside a lane parallel to 100ft Road (Defence Colony side). Literally has doodle walls, board games, serves great lemon tea and maggi.
* **Bun Story:** On a quiet stretch of 4th B Cross. Specializes in gourmet buns (pulled chicken, spicy paneer) and filter coffee. A couple of sidewalk tables.
* **Amritsari Kulcha Hub:** Less cafe, more eatup. Inside a lane off 12th Main. Standing space and one bench, but famous for its kulcha-chhole and lassi.

# Thematic / Vibe-Based Spots

* **Vintage Brew:** Near the 80ft Road junction with a inner lane. Done up with old radios and film posters. Serves ""tapri-style"" cutting chai but with add-ons like oreo or ginger kick.
* **Crossroads Chai & Conversations:** Exactly at a 5-way intersection deep inside the residential area (searchable on Maps). Built around a tree, known for long conversations, simple sandwiches, and diverse chai.

I remember on my first year really excited to learn all this CS technologies and get in to the tech industry. But reality hit so hard. Tried everything I could to save summer intern like coffee chat, cold email, cold LinkedIn message nothing works. I also been pay my living cost alone without any support so I'm really worried i'm unable to pay for my living cost for summer.

1qy7mor,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewNeptuneSaturn/comments/1qy7mor/mothers/,Mothers,"I’m mad at my Mom but also I’m not mad because I understand why she is how she is and because I love her. Unfortunately, this translates itself to my relationships with women. 

I understand completely, I love her, I’m here anyway. I feel like that about all of my exes and Eros’. Especially S. I can’t seem to let go of her because something’s off…like you know that feeling like something’s wrong? I’m not leaving her like that. I’m here if she needs me. It’s probably totally selfish on my part but I’m not just closing the door on her. I’m leaving it open, not because I think she’s going to choose me but because I care about her. We are friends. Real friends. I’m not into babyshowers and weddings and nail salons or mall trips. I’m the friend you call when you need a coffee, a cry or help painting something. 

So…do I forgive myself and my mother? Yeah. I love my Mom. She didn’t hurt me on purpose. I know she loves me. Life just happens. 

I forgive myself too. I’ve been the one without boundaries, making the same mistakes, hurting myself and calling it love. 

Isn’t this how the story goes? It’s a 3 plane story. 

First; internal. My Eros left my body when it happened. I saw a little too closely what I’m attracted to. I forgive myself and I know I’m worth more than this. I learned a lot of lessons on discernment in love to help keep me safe going forward.

Second; long game. I wrote “I’ve been in love with Eros since I was 15.” I’ve been in love triangles since that age. Plus, they’re Aries/Libra eclipse cycles of the people I’ve loved the most. Nicole, Celeste, Melissa, Sarah. 

Third; Eros tour. I intuitively wrote these stories beforehand. Sooo… idk. 

The mental health piece is obvious. But I’m not hallucinating, I don’t think I’m the character…I’m living the myth outwardly? That’s fascinating. The more grounded I get in my body the more perplexing it is. 

I lived as psyche. Many people were attracted. Each Eros was a task. There were 3 Eros that I loved. Eros felt bad for me but she kept choosing someone else over me. I’ve had to learn lessons of discernment and boundaries with each Eros. I’ve had to slowly learn to distance myself from prospective Eros’. Only the first 3 I loved. 

In the myth and in my story I’m in the 4th chapter. I emerged from the underworld. I’m learning to implement my lessons and choose myself first. I need boundaries and to adjust how and when I attach. 

In my 4th chapter I wrote about how in the first 3 chapters of Eros she hurt me so much. She cheated, she lied, she married someone else. And that changed me. So in the 4th, Eros comes back again after having married someone else. She learned a lot from being married. It actually made her a better person, to the point she could see how horrible she was to the person she loved most. I wasn’t so quick to let her in the door but it’s Eros…I love her and she did seem different. And my Mom does actually believe Eros means it this time. 

That’s all I have. 

So…the question I’m stuck on is how seriously do I take this? In terms of mental health; yeah, I choose me first. No  chasing eros or excuses for him until he shows up and takes accountability and chooses me. I did write that as the final  part of my story. I don’t know what happens after that. 

I’m in that phase where I feel differently in my body and  know overall I’ve shifted. That new part of me is getting stronger. I’m not going back to old patterns. The universe keeps sending me options and I’m not taking the bait. I’m using my lessons to keep me safe. 

So….do I get my souls desire? Or is that just wishful thinking? ",1,1770449642.0,u_NewNeptuneSaturn,0,1.0,False
1qy7lyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscordGroupRP/comments/1qy7lyq/modern_fantasy_back_roads_city_lights/,[Modern Fantasy] Back Roads & City Lights,"*Back Roads & City Lights* is a modern-fantasy role-play set in Seattle, Washington, and the surrounding sprawl—from rain-slick downtown streets and neon-lit alleys to quiet coastal towns and the shadowed edges of the Cascades. On the surface, it’s coffee shops, tech start-ups, ferry rides, and traffic on I-5. Underneath, it’s Veil Accords, old blood pacts, and things with teeth and claws that never left when the world moved on. Vampires, werewolves, witches, hunters, and utterly mundane humans all move through the same city lights and back roads, working, loving, surviving… and trying very hard not to let the truth slip into the headlines.



The group focuses on character-driven, freeform storytelling: slice-of-life scenes, slow-burn drama, supernatural investigations, quiet horror, and the messy politics of keeping the secret in a city wired with cameras and social media. Want to play the exhausted FBI agent who keeps catching cases that don’t make sense, the bartender whose regulars include both wolves and cops, the occultist in a Capitol Hill walk-up who knows too much, or the hunter who’s starting to doubt the cause? There’s a rich, established lore foundation—werewolf packs, vampire societies, hunter cells, government departments, and more—but it’s built to give you hooks, not fences.



*Back Roads & City Lights* is a collaborative sandbox for players who enjoy long-term arcs, found family, and consequences that actually matter. Plots can be intimate or sprawling: a single rainy night in a Pioneer Square alley, a multi-thread investigation running from Belltown to the backwoods, or the slow unraveling of a character who realizes the world is nothing like they thought. If you’re looking for a grounded modern setting with room to tell your stories—where the supernatural is hidden but never passive—we’d be happy to have you pull off the highway, park under the flickering neon, and step into the dark with us.



* An 18+ Semi-Lit to Novella Modern Fantasy Role-Play.
* Deep World Lore thats always expanding and evolving.
* Multiple locations within the Puget Sound Area to play within. From the mist-filled forests of the Cascades, to the urban sprawl of the Seattle metro area
* Welcoming to the novice and veteran alike, Knowledgeable Admin and Mods to support you in answering questions about the lore and in character creation.

1qy7l67,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qy7l67/how_to_dissolve_social_anxiety_and_connect_with/,# How to Dissolve Social Anxiety and Connect With Anyone: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Social anxiety isn't just about being ""shy"" or ""introverted."" It's your nervous system convinced that every conversation is a potential threat. Your brain literally can't tell the difference between walking into a party and walking into a lion's den. After deep diving into neuroscience research, therapy modalities, and real stories from people who've overcome this, I've compiled what actually works. Not the recycled ""just be confident"" BS, but real, research-backed strategies that rewire how your brain processes social situations.

Here's what helped me and thousands of others move from panic-inducing small talk to genuinely enjoying human connection.

**Understand you're fighting biology, not a character flaw**

Your amygdala (the fear center in your brain) is hyperactive. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's research shows that anxiety literally hijacks your nervous system. When someone asks ""how are you,"" your body responds like you're being interrogated. This isn't weakness. It's your nervous system stuck in survival mode.

The fix isn't positive thinking. It's regulation.

* Polyvagal exercises work insanely well. Before social situations, do bilateral stimulation. Tap your knees alternating left-right for 2 minutes. Sounds stupid, feels stupid, works incredibly well. This activates your vagus nerve and signals safety to your brain. Dr. Stephen Porges's polyvagal theory explains why this works when ""calm down"" doesn't.
* The 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. Mid-conversation panic? Mentally note 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. Brings you back to the present instead of spiraling about what they're thinking about you.

**Reframe how you view conversations**

Most socially anxious people treat conversations like performances they're failing. Psychologist Ellen Hendriksen's research found that shifting from ""performance mode"" to ""curiosity mode"" dramatically reduces anxiety.

* Ask questions you're genuinely curious about. Not interview questions. Real curiosity. ""What made you get into that?"" ""What's that like?"" People love talking about themselves and you get a break from performing.
* The spotlight effect is lying to you. Research from Cornell shows we overestimate how much others notice our anxiety by like 50%. That thing you're obsessing over? They didn't notice. And if they did, they forgot 30 seconds later.

**Actually practice, but smart**

Exposure therapy works, but most people do it wrong. You don't jump into a networking event when ordering coffee makes you sweat.

* Ladder your exposures. Start ridiculously small. Week 1: Make eye contact with a cashier. Week 2: Ask them how their day is. Week 3: Small talk with a barista. Gradual exposure retrains your nervous system that social interaction won't kill you. Dr. David Burns covers this brilliantly in ""[When Panic Attacks](https://a.co/d/08OsmQs0),"" genuinely the best cognitive behavioral therapy book for anxiety. Burns is a Stanford psychiatrist who developed innovative CBT techniques. This book gives you actual worksheets and exercises, not vague advice. Made me realize most of my ""truths"" about social situations were just anxious thoughts I'd never questioned.
* Use the app Finch for habit building. Track your daily exposures, celebrate small wins. The gamification actually helps because your brain needs positive reinforcement that social stuff isn't dangerous.

If you want to go deeper on overcoming social anxiety but don't have the time or energy to read through multiple books and research papers, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been really useful. It's an AI-powered personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that pulls from psychology books, research papers, and expert insights on social anxiety and communication to create custom audio podcasts just for you.

You can set a specific goal like ""overcome social anxiety as an introvert"" and it generates a structured learning plan tailored to your unique struggles. You can choose between a 10-minute summary when you're short on time or a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples and strategies when you really want to understand something. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a sarcastic style that makes learning feel less like work. It's basically designed to make self-improvement fit into your commute or gym time without feeling like another chore.

**Get comfortable with silence and awkwardness**

The irony? Trying to avoid awkwardness creates more of it. Accepting that some conversations will be weird is weirdly freeing.

* Pause before responding. Anxious people rush to fill silence. Taking 2 seconds to think makes you seem more thoughtful anyway. Silence isn't the emergency your brain thinks it is.
* ""That's interesting"" is your new best friend. Don't know what to say? This buys you time and keeps conversation going. Sometimes simple beats clever.

**Address the root stuff**

Social anxiety usually isn't just about social situations. It's often attached to deeper beliefs about worthiness and belonging.

* ""[The Body Keeps the Score](https://a.co/d/05cAtt7u)"" by Bessel van der Kolk is mandatory reading. Van der Kolk is like the godfather of trauma research, MacArthur Fellowship winner, spent decades studying how trauma lives in the body. This book completely changed how I understood why I felt anxious around people. Turns out my body was holding onto old experiences where connection felt unsafe. It's dense but insanely good. This will make you question everything you thought you knew about why you feel anxious.
* The Anxiety Coaches Podcast with Gina Ryan covers practical techniques weekly. Ryan's a therapist who actually gets it, breaks down complex psychology into bite sized, usable stuff. Episodes on social anxiety specifically are gold.
* Try the app Sanvello for real-time anxiety tracking. Helps you notice patterns. Maybe you're fine one-on-one but groups trigger you. Maybe certain topics spike your anxiety. Data helps you target what to work on.

**Shift your metric for success**

Stop measuring success by ""did I seem cool"" and start measuring by ""did I stay present."" Recovery isn't becoming the life of the party. It's being able to exist in social spaces without your nervous system freaking out.

You're not broken. Your brain learned that people are dangerous, and now you're teaching it something different. That takes time and lots of awkward practice. But every small exposure, every moment you stay instead of flee, you're literally rewiring neural pathways.

The goal isn't to never feel anxious. It's to feel it and connect anyway.",1,1770449493.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

I’m based between the North West and West Midlands and ideally would love to meet people locally, but I’m also happy to travel a bit if needed. Somewhat around my age would be good, but I'm cool as long as 18+ as the connection is more important!

I'd describe myself as easy going, a little introverted, and can be a bit shy to start with, but soon open up once I’m comfortable. Ideally, I’d like to start by chatting online and, if we get on, meet up in real life. I’m looking for something long-term and a genuine mate or two.

Into hiking, nature, and getting outdoors. Also enjoy watching the F1, reading, history, and cooking. Like travelling, exploring new places, and learning languages too.

Would be happy to just chat, meet for a drink or coffee, explore somewhere new, do a hike together... Up for different plans!

If you're looking for something similar and are interested, feel free to message me!

1qy7jqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperLog_Net/comments/1qy7jqn/blockchain_for_veracity_vs_privacy/,Blockchain for Veracity vs Privacy !,"In this era of ever exploding data, with AI increasing it exponentially, it is now much more pertinent to ascertain the veracity of the data - be it generated by an AI agent or a natural person. This veracity has to be automatic and open along with attribution if being used by another person/agent.

This requirement can be fulfilled by a blockchain which is a distributed immutable ledger of the data being created by the agent or person. 

[Blockchain for Veracity vs Privacy !](https://preview.redd.it/phcilocuy0ig1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b960051ba497c154714a4d83c6feaf01bc2c280)

One of the most important issue with this is privacy. While veracity of the data is good, people want to share the data privately and only with select persons but blockchain has the data publicly available to everyone for maintaining its immutability. Hence, at HyperLog we have introduced the concept of encrypted payloads in which certain parts of the payload is encrypted and will be available only to the owner or persons allowed for a specific timeframe.

This allows a person say a manufacturer to upload details of its supply chain on HyperLog to create an immutable ledger with time eg if an organic producer of coffee could capture from the time of purchase of the seeds by three layer downstream farmer, its harvesting, processing, storing and further transportation as and when its happening and make the data available to its customers. A fraudulent person won't be able to mimic the entire supply chain, transport, processing in which multiple players are involved and each one updating the product which finally get consumed to form a new product.

Similarly, say a builder whose project has a large gestation period and after which the flats are being sold can meticulously capture the developent of the flat on HyperLog eg the purchase of the doors and windows, electricity fitments, plumbing fitments, kitchen equipments, tiles etc could be sourced through HyperLog which connects the purchase to its manufacturer. The final user then have all the details of the house and its maintenance requirements. 

The explosion of posts on Instagram, X and others also points out the problem that veracity of the digital content and its attribution is important. The network of interaction of a person/agent on HyperLog generates a score called HyperScore which denotes the veracity of the digital content.

For a business enterprise, HyperLog can be implemented as a closed blockchain in which data insertion is being done by the approved partners while the veracity checking can be done by the consumers online. This not only improves the trust in the product but also increase the supply chain visibility, getting to know the problems before the raw material lands at your doorstep.

For general public, HyperLog maintains a main-net also in which general public can also insert data blocks - which may or may not be encrypted. It could also be used as an inventory for general public where their goods receive enterprise level inventory tooling and a verifiable ledger if they want to sell it again.",1,1770449352.0,HyperLog_Net,0,1.0,False

You know the drill - hitting snooze four times, dragging myself out of bed at the last possible second, and starting the day feeling like I’m already losing a race.

​Today, I decided to try something different. I got up before sunrise, and instead of reaching for my phone to scroll, I just got on my mat.

​I clearly noticed a difference in terms of how my mind was.

​There is a specific kind of silence at 6:00 AM. It’s not just the absence of noise; it’s a sense of possibility. Doing my flow while the light was just starting to change felt... honestly, it felt like I was reclaiming my life.

I had ​no brain fog. Usually, I’m a zombie until my second coffee. Today, the movement and the breathwork cleared the cobwebs better than caffeine ever has.

​No one was emailing me. No notifications were popping up. It was the first time in a long time I felt like I was doing something just for me.

Instead of feeling frantic and behind, I feel grounded. I feel like I’ve already accomplished something meaningful before my real day has even started.

​If you’re like me and you’ve been struggling with your routine, I can’t recommend this enough. It’s a beautiful feeling to meet the day on your own terms rather than letting the day crash over you.

1qy7hp1,http://youtube.com/watch?v=ChntJVuErlg&t,Grok showed me how to cure RAS (Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis) aka recurring canker sores and it recommended taking 1000 mcg of b12 sublingually for 3 - 12 months depending on the severity of deficiency. Dr. Berg a youtuber with 14 million subscribers also recommended this. I'll link his video below,"Dr. Berg canker sore B12 deficiency video


Other deficiencies mentioned by Grok along with b12 with cited sources

Iron: For iron deficiency anemia or low ferritin linked to RAS, take 100-200 mg of elemental iron daily, divided into 2-3 doses to improve absorption and reduce side effects. 
This is often achieved with ferrous sulfate 
(e.g., 325 mg tablets, containing ~65 mg elemental iron, taken 2-3 times daily). Take on an empty stomach with vitamin C for better absorption, but with food if it causes nausea. Continue for at least 3 months after levels normalize. 
Avoid tea, coffee, or calcium supplements near doses, as they inhibit absorption.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11373730/

Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin): 1000 mcg (1 mg) daily, preferably sublingual (under the tongue) or oral, for 6 months or longer if needed. 
This dose has shown effectiveness in reducing RAS episodes even in some non-deficient patients, but it's most beneficial if levels are low. 
If absorption is impaired (e.g., due to pernicious anemia), injections (1000 mcg weekly for 4-6 weeks, then monthly) may be prescribed instead. 

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1479540/   (this study shows complete recovery in patients with RAS supplementing 1000 mcg of b12 for 6 months - 1 year)


Folate (Folic Acid): 1-5 mg (1000-5000 mcg) daily for severe deficiencies, but start with 400-1000 mcg daily for mild cases or maintenance. 
 
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3323114/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20141576/


Zinc deficiency is frequently linked to RAS, with meta-analyses showing significantly lower serum zinc levels in RAS patients compared to controls, potentially impairing wound healing, immune function, and mucosal integrity. 

Pilot studies and reviews suggest that about 20-30% of RAS cases may involve low zinc, and supplementation can help in those with confirmed deficiency (serum zinc <70 mcg/dL). 

Recommended Dose (If Deficient): 15-50 mg elemental zinc daily (e.g., as zinc gluconate or sulfate) for 1-3 months, then reassess levels. Higher doses (up to 220 mg/day in some studies) have been used short-term but can cause nausea or copper imbalance. 

https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/14/1/260

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262531546_Zinc_deficiency_in_patients_with_recurrent_aphthous_stomatitis_A_pilot_study


Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency is less commonly a primary driver of RAS but has been associated in some reviews, particularly in combination with other deficiencies like B12 or folate, where it may affect antioxidant capacity, collagen synthesis, and ulcer healing. 

Recommended Dose (If Deficient): 500-1000 mg daily, divided into doses to improve absorption and reduce GI upset. For severe deficiency (scurvy-like), up to 2000 mg/day short-term under guidance. 

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11811097/

https://pocketdentistry.com/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/


Dietary sources like leafy greens (for folate), red meat, oysters, and nuts (for iron and B12), and fermented foods can support long-term levels. If symptoms persist despite normal levels, other causes like stress, allergies, or autoimmune conditions should be explored.




Hope this helps anyone looking for answers to this painful disease. 
I also recommend the ultimate guide to canker sores that has a dietary list of foods to avoid. 


Here's my diet in a nutshell

I personally only eat unseasoned/unsalted meat, non-starchy veggies, leafy greens and eggs. 

For drinks I only have purified water,  unsweetened nut milks, and very select teas like chamomile, marshmallow root, and turmeric 
Tea. 

Just make sure the tea doesn't contain anything citric or fruity (lemon/lemon peel, orange/orange peel, raspberry, blackberry, etc.) especially no citric acid. 

Absolutely no cane sugar, syrup, or processed honey. Even certain types of organic honey affect me. The only sweeteners I can have safely are stevia and monk fruit sugar with erythritol or xylitol. 

For seasoning just do herbs, raw turmeric/organic turmeric powder, and raw ginger/organic ginger powder (some people have issues with ginger but I can have small amounts at a time)
For herbs I use the brand Simply Organic and do fine with their Italian Seasoning and Cilantro products. 

The rice cooker/steamer is my best friend. 
I pretty much stay on a soup diet and use beef bone broth powder mixed in water, and then throw in whatever meat, veggies, and leafy greens I want to throw in there, konjac noodles, eggs, my seasonings, a little Himalayan salt, turmeric, and ginger. I then hit the steam button and set it to 5 minutes (really takes 10 - 15 min to heat up and cook all the way through) on my aroma rice cooker/steamer and then at the very end I stir in organic unsweetened coconut powder. 

As long as I don't stray from the diet I don't get any canker sores. Hoping eventually the Vitamin supplements will make this painful ailment go away so I can eat like a normal person. Until then, it's soup diet for me. 

I also make my own coconut milk or almond milk ice cream with homemade unsweetened roasted almond butter thrown in and do fine with that as well. Wholefoods has an unsweetened almond butter under the 365 brand that you can get off Amazon that's surprisingly cheap if you don't have a fancy vitamix to make it at home.
Just requires a blender and ice tray to make the ice cream.

For the sweetener I do monk fruit sugar and instead of vanilla extract I get organic non-alcoholic vanilla flavoring off Amazon and use twice the amount the recipe calls for

I want to highlight that not everyone has the same trigger foods or safe foods so it's important to throw in one ingredient at a time and wait a week or two if you find yourself getting flares.",1,1770449153.0,CankerSores,4,1.0,False

Luna's Butterfly Tattoo
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
Five springs had passed since I terminated the mate bond with Alpha Landon Ashford when we met again in a tattoo studio.

He was there to touch up the name of his mate across his chest.

I was there to cover the old scars on my wrist.

Years had slipped by, and for a long moment, we simply stood there, wordless, looking at each other.

Just as Landon broke the silence and was about to speak, the hem of his shirt was tugged by a small hand.

""Daddy."" The little boy stared at me curiously, ""Who is she?""

…

The island breeze stirred the wind chimes hanging outside the porch, breaking the long, heavy quiet.

""I'm a customer,"" I said, ""Same as your dad. Just here for a tattoo.""

The boy tilted his head, ""Do you know my dad?""

""Marcus!"" Landon's tone sharpened, and the boy pouted, falling quiet.

""Nope,"" I answered anyway, ""We're strangers.""

Landon's expression darkened.

The shop owner tapped the counter, glancing between us. ""Who's first?""

Landon had been leaning against the bar, but now he straightened, his eyes fixed on me. ""She goes.""

He wore an off-white linen shirt tucked into silver-gray slacks, the top buttons undone, revealing the defined lines of his chest.

Over his left pec was a tattoo, partly obscured, but I knew exactly whose name it was.

Even when we terminated our mate bond, that name had not yet been inked over Landon's heart.

""First come, first served."" My voice was polite, distant. ""Please, after you.""

Before Landon could respond, his phone vibrated. By chance, I caught a glimpse of the screen: Sweetheart.

The screen went dark as he immediately pressed it, and he looked straight at me. I turned away and walked toward the lounge booth.

Behind me came the excited voice of the boy, ""Was that Mommy calling?""

Landon's reply came low and cool, the way he always sounded when he was trying to soothe someone.

His voice blended with the cello music humming softly through the studio.

I stirred my coffee without looking up until a small, timid ""Ma'am"" sounded beside me.

I turned. The little boy from earlier was leaning over the armrest, peering at me.

He was delicate and pretty in a soft, bookish way, impossibly cute.

Cute enough that even knowing who his father was, I couldn't bring myself to feel any resentment.

""You know,"" he whispered as if sharing a secret, ""you look a lot like my mom. She's a beautiful superstar.""

""Then you must look like her, too.""

His eyes lit up instantly, and he leaned forward as if wanting to get closer, but a large hand pressed down gently on his head.

Landon patted him lightly. ""Go wait in the car with Mr. Vaelen.""

I lifted a brow. Turning, I saw the middle-aged man who had followed Landon for years.

Our eyes met. Shock washed over his face, mixed with something faintly embarrassed. ""Miss Sinclair…""

I nodded calmly. He was Landon's most trusted beta, and we had crossed paths many times before.

Landon scooped the boy into his arms. As he rose, a glint of gold flickered at his wrist.

His watch. A Patek Philippe. A model he never would have chosen back then.

On his long ring finger was a plain band, understated yet impossibly expensive.

During the two years Landon and I were bonded, he never wore a bonding ring.

So this was what it felt like to marry a destined mate.

I took a sip of my coffee, realizing it was a feeling that didn't fade with time.

Just like rhyming cookie treats.

But if you like your coffee bitter,

No worries, I have all the fritters.

Poetry can be love, heartbreak all in one,

It may make sense to more than some.

Poetry is drama, emotions, light and dark,

A raging fire without a spark.

Words should follow into your heart,

If not, poetry's not doing its part.

/

Poems without beautiful rhymes,

Are called free verse, and are not a crime.

When words flow without a thought,

Poetry comforts an aching heart.

/

Poetry can be serious or funny too,

Where magic runs on feelings few.

A satire, parody or limerick,

Can all perform a funny trick.

It's your choice what you choose,

For every poem has a muse. 

I prefer coffee over tea,

Would you like to try some poetry?

*Love Between Lines* is the unicorn of a modern C-drama for me. This is my first time writing a review for a modern C-drama, and perhaps it will also be my last one as well for this genre. I am and have always been just a costume/historical C-drama girlie. I save the modern ones for my K-dramas. The only reason (despite adoring Chen Xingxu as an actor) that *Love Between Lines* (LBL) was on my radar was because of the beautiful outfits I saw from the Republic Era in the drama for the gaming aspect. Listen, this girl doesn’t watch modern C-dramas at all, because they’ve never had the appeal for me. I decided to skim LBL to gawk at the stunning styling and costumes of the lead stars of the drama while I was waiting for another historical C-drama to release more episodes.

However, by episode 3, can confirm it was hook, line, and sinker for me. I ended up dropping the other historical C-drama because it was sinking anyway, and LBL was just meant to be, with its mesmerizing charm. I was captivated. I have so much to say from what I love about this drama, to what I wish could have been done better. Despite the critiques, I absolutely loved most of this drama. So here’s to parts review, critiques, and fangirling.

*Love Between Lines* at its core, is a heartfelt and healing love story between two people, Hu Xiu and Xiao Zhi Yu who first meet in a virtual game, and then through a series of chance encounters, they cross paths in real life.

[the first meeting in the drama](https://preview.redd.it/qir1ivp5u0ig1.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=f051394fbb4df3e93f212058372744217fc7cb07)

[Hu Xiu meeting the male lead in real life.](https://preview.redd.it/iz4e3228u0ig1.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c17f71e9725b1910a181104f3d7755ecbd4e485)

Hu Xiu is a young woman who has had to be pragmatic, shouldering the responsibility and expectations of her parents. Her dad was involved in a serious accident that resulted in a permanent injury that altered his life. Hu Xiu, upon graduating college with the aspiring dream of becoming an architectural designer, has put her dreams on hold to essentially be the bread-winner for her parents. Overtime, she resigned to being an assistant in a dead-end-job in real estate where she’s forced to work to the point of burning out. She has also settled in life and in her partner, losing a part of herself to make those around her happy, only to find herself dumped in a humiliating manner by her fiancé at her engagement party.

Xiao Zhiyu, the male lead of our story, is a self-made, successful founder of a small but mighty architecture company named Dynamism, whose rising reputation continues to dominate in the field. As a youth, he was practically abandoned by his own mom and left his stepfather’s home to grieve and make a name for himself. He chose to follow in his own father’s footsteps, who too was an architect. Xiao Zhiyu is also determined to uncover the mystery surrounding his father’s death, which was ruled as a suicide, and to find those who he believes are truly responsible. Xiao Zhiyu is astute, observant, and keeps to himself. He is thoughtful though and exudes incredible patience and quiet strength. On the surface, he is incredibly calm and patient, but beneath that lies invisible scars of abandonment, and the pain that he could never be worthy of love.

And the two meet by chance in the virtual murder mystery gaming world called ‘Midnight, set in the fictional city of Rongcheng during the Republic Era of China. Hu Xiu enters the game in hopes that she could at least win and control some things in life when her engagement was dissolved, and Xiao Zhiyu escapes into the game to be the titular NPC (non-playable character), Commander Qian Xiao Yi, where he can truly be himself without any pretenses, free of the burdens of his world.

Hu Xiu and Xiao Zhiyu eventually cross paths in real life, where Xiao Zhiyu is weary of Hu Xiu, having encountered her several times in the gaming world but wishes to keep his life private. As for Hu Xiu, she is simply curious about Xiao Zhiyu, fascinated by the person behind the character of Commander Qian Xiao Yi.

By the turn of events, Xiao Zhiyu becomes Hu Xiu’s tenant, and eventually, they become roommates. Throughout the game, and in the real world, there are threads of lost dreams and lost of sense of self, and finding out what one truly wants. Hu Xiu and Xiao Zhi Yu first form a small connection through their roles in the game, and in real life, for their love of architecture. They’re both in their own ways, are champions pulling yourself up by the bootstraps when life is hard. They view their choices as pragmatic but sometimes forget themselves and their own worth in the process. >!Then as the two become roommates, friends, and colleagues, they start to help each other grow and heal. Hu Xiu recognizes that behind the confident smiles and the way Xiao Zhiyu carries himself, he’s guarded and lonely. Not one to easily share his thoughts or life with. However, Hu Xiu, with her support, friendship and radiant light, slowly chips away at the exterior Xiao Zhiyu has fortified.!<

>!And before they even realize it, they’ve fallen devotedly in love with each other. Xiao Zhiyu is unable to take 10,000 steps without finding his way back to Hu Xiu. Hu Xiu realizes she never needed to settle for love, and that in Xiao Zhiyu, she found the courage to be brave with whatever she had to face and to charge forward with her dreams while his love held her steadfast.!< But will their bond survive through broken dreams, the mysterious death behind Xiao Zhiyu’s dad’s, Xiao Zhiyu’s scheming stepdad, Hu Xiu’s dad’s past injury tied to a huge secret, and the fear of being worthy of love? Will their love persevere through the darkness and help them heal through the light they find in each other?

The TLDR version is: Although I had issues with the last 5 episodes of the drama, I thoroughly loved this romantic, heartfelt, and endearing love story between our leads: Xiao Zhi Yu/ Qian Xiao Yi and Hu Xiu. Their love story was so organic: from strangers, to friends, to having a crush, to falling and being devotedly in love with each other. The other subplots were the weak parts of the drama, specifically the death mystery thread of the male lead’s dad, the relationship troubles with the female lead’s bestie and the bestie’s husband, and the expectations and acceptance of parental love. Some of the later episodes had issues with flow and the characters reacted in ways that felt out of character at times too. But overall, this drama was so comforting and romantic. LBL is a beautiful, magnetic love story brought to life by Chen Xingxu and Lu Yuxiao. I truly believed their characters fell so hopelessly in love with each other, and in anyone else’s hands, I’m certain the magic wouldn’t have been there the way Chen Xingxu and Lu Yuxiao delivered their characters, like rent was due. They certainly understood their assignment.

Now, for the long review of LBL, please grab a cup of coffee or tea, especially in honor of Regards Café—the fictional coffee shop that belongs to Hu Xiu’s (female lead) best friend. **The lengthy thoughts ahead are filled with spoilers, so tread with caution.**

I’m going to continue on what I wished the drama could have done better before I talk more about what I love later on, because fangirling to me is the easy and fun part of why I loved this drama so much. I am totally ready for the pitchforks to come after me as I dive in.

First I’ll nit-pick the minor things. I have a bone to pick with the makeup and costume department of the drama. I know fashion choices can be so subjective, but I felt we had a different set of group styling at times. The inconsistent dressing and styling of our leads at times were frustrating. The clothing in the gaming world was spectacular and well-tailored. However, in the real world, there were times when Xiao Zhiyu wore poorly fitted suits. Some of the outfits were questionable too, and it almost drowned out our actor. He has a nice physique, and this was showcased more with outfits of him as a commander in the game, with the cloak. He had a few nice suits that fit him well in the real world, but some of the outfits were odd.

This is the same for Hu Xiu. When she was in the game, her outfits were stunning and gorgeous, paired with her makeup and hairstyling too. I loved every single one of her gaming outfits in the drama. In the real world though, I beg to differ. When she was in the long, yellow, light dresses, it was perfectly lovely on her. However, some of her work outfits towards the end were strange to me along with the clunky shoes and socks. Sometimes her hairstyle seemed off too, like unpolished, which made it look like her hair had breakage.

>!Then how her fiancé broke off the engagement--I actually hated how they handled it. I know the scene was to show how humiliating it was for Hu Xiu, but it was hardly believable that a kid was the one to plug in her laptop to get the speakers working so the audience could hear her fiancé’s message on surround sound. was known. I felt this could have been done better. Which leads me to the ex-fiancé’s actual wedding to another woman.!<

>!I felt like this scene could have been executed better by making the bride actually an awful person, so that would just make things easier. Or, if they really wanted the bride to not know anything at first, the fact that Hu Xiu showed up with Xiao Zhiyu would have been enough for the gossip to spread like wildfire from the mutual classmates at the wedding. This would give the bride to find out what actually happened instead of being humiliated at her own wedding, after the fact that she took her vows with the jerk ex. Afterall, the talks from the classmates were how Xiao Zhiyu found out the groom was Hu Xiu’s ex-fiancé.!<

>!LOL, and Hu Xiu needed more purpose to attend that wedding, not just to be the tablet and document carrier for Xiao Zhiyu, even if I loved that they got their screen time. Maybe Hu Xiu saves the bride from something by climbing out the window to do so, gaining everyone’s awe, or pointing out something to the client about the design of an architectural piece.!<

>!That white dress that Xiao Zhiyu gifted Hu Xiu for the event…I wanted to love it! And while it looks stunning, it didn’t do our girl justice. In some of the shots, it looked like the way the dress was cute flattened our girl’s chest. It looked good on the mannequin display, but I feel something with the right cut and fit would have elevated the scene with Hu Xiu in the dress. Was she still stunning and turning heads left and right, absolutely. Look at how Pei Zhen looked at her, and how floored Xiao Zhiyu was when he turned and saw her walking in.!<

[The image above is from IG user: \(at\)meet\_drama\_now](https://preview.redd.it/wwmazhc3v0ig1.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=e158c56c91fbb34a265951dcdff6c8570cdd5dec)

>!Another small thing they could have included that would be a great nod to Xiao Zhiyu’s dad would be that towards the end, Hu Xiu could tie her project in with Papa Qin’s concept and then made it her own with her touches. I think that it would be just as powerful and touching to Xiao Zhiyu to have his dad’s work brought forward.!<

>!Okay, this next issue I have is minor in a way, but conflicting for me. I will preface this by, I love my pets. They’re family to me, and I would lay my life down the line and carve out the years of my lifespan if I could have kept my dogs with me longer on this physical plane of Earth. Lu Yuxiao appears to also be a huge dog-lover, since I believe I’ve seen her bring 2 of her pups with her around. With that being said, I didn’t like the drama’s scene with the couple adopting the kitten for the sake of the conversation they had. No shade to the kitten, it was the way the dialogue was written about this. I say this as someone who carries deep grief from the constant loves in her life, which are my dogs. Suddenly a kitten is found lost in the building as a stray. Hu Xiu brings in the kitten and Xiao Zhiyu mentions how he’s never had a pet because there would be grief when the pet dies. I don’t feel this belongs in the drama the way things are written. I think this would have been instead a much more powerful scene for him to reflect on his mom’s abandonment, and how when his dad died, he felt alone and afraid, often traveling in darkness. The conversation with having pets feels cheapened, even if I know what the intention of the scene was really for. It just didn’t work for me. Having Xiao Zhiyu share about his grief from childhood and Hu Xiu showing him that he’s worthy of love, even when we don’t know what will happen in the future, she would stand by him and weather through things with him.!<

>!Okay, now onto some bigger things that I have issues with.!<

>!I actually felt the parts focusing on the bestie, Zhao Xiao Rou, and her husband, eventually ex-husband, was truly a waste of time on the drama. They really could have started off with Zhao Xiao Rou being very business-driven, especially after the divorce, which the divorce could have been done off-screen at the start of the drama, so they didn’t have to waste time trying to pull so many storylines together. If they wanted to show us that Zhao Xiao Rou and Gong Huai Cong could possibly be something in the end, that’s fine. This also gives the drama more time to develop a potential, budding love story with the two besties of the leads. The other thing too was eliminating this divorce part might open up more time for us to focus on other things in the story that the drama is weak on, such as resolving the mystery surrounding Xiao Zhi Yu’s father’s death, or how our leads heal from their lived experiences, with Xiao Zhi Yu letting himself heal from the trauma, and Hu Xiu healing from how much she gave up for her parents too.!<

>!Speaking about the parents…every single living parent in this drama were pieces of turd. We already know this about Xiao Zhiyu’s stepdad, who is also Pei Zhen’s biological father. I’ll come back to attack Pei Zhen too. LOL. Anyway, let’s start with the easy, which is Evil Stepdad, because we already know he’s corrupt, evil, and cruel. This feels like a good enough place to talk about his decision to want to kill off Hu Xiu later in the drama though. That came from such left field. There was nowhere initially that I felt the drama was headed in this direction, because if Evil Stepdad was plotting this I would have thought he’d have taken the chance to stage an accident in eliminating Xiao Zhiyu from the start. I am puzzled a bit by the writing there.!<

>!The mystery plot of Xiao Zhiyu’s dad’s death and who was behind it to me, were weak parts of the drama. Which I’ll forgive, considering the overall picture. It was hard for me to believe that the minion of Evil Stepdad hid a micro chip just in case things went south. That was just too easy. Then the confrontational showdown with Xiao Zhiyu coming in with evidence to reveal it all to his stepdad, useless mom, and stepbrother, was really bleh and meh. I think actually it would have been so nice to see Hu Xiu be there just to support him? Like stand by him, which I think would be so sweet as this is going down…but that’s just me.!<

>!The fact that Xiao Zhiyu’s mom married Evil Stepdad after her husband (Xiao Zhiyu’s dad) died, feels really gross. She went on to be such a lackluster character, and the actress felt miscast. Her character neglected her son, chose to turn a blind eye to the abuse she was witnessing, and then ultimately acted like she was a victim who didn’t know the burdens her own biological son carried. There was a scene where she yelled at her son about how he’s destroying her family, aka marriage with Evil Stepdad too…Then she had the audacity to ask him why he didn’t tell her his concerns as a child. What the fudge. In the end, she got away scoot-free from any consequences of her action, packed her bags, and left. The drama didn’t really even bother to try to mend the relationship with her and Xiao Zhiyu, or maybe she just didn’t care. All that was brushed under the rug. It would have been better then if Xiao Zhiyu cut her out from his life. She was really lucky that despite how he had to grow up, her son was very thoughtful and considerate, and still became a wonderful human being.!<

>!Hu Xiu’s parents didn’t fare any better. Both were awful too. The drama tried to depict their family as warm and loving, but I felt all that was just a façade. The family simply didn’t speak of their problems. Once Hu Xiu’s dad suffered an injury that paralyzed him, it’s like they lived in this la-la-land of just letting their daughter continue with her dead-end job and never once dove deep into conversation with her and let her heal from that or from her broken engagement. Hu Xiu carried her family on her back for so long. And then when the great reveal happened that it was supposedly Xiao Zhiyu’s dad who caused the accident that paralyzed Hu Xiu’s dad, the parents got worse. They guilted Hu Xiu and seemed to blame the fault on Xiao Zhiyu, simply because he was the son. They actually believed the son should be responsible to bear the faults of his father? How was this okay. It wasn’t until Hu Xiu fought tooth and nail to be by Xiao Zhiyu’s side did the parents even seem to relent. I mean it helped that the culprit who cased all the pain and suffering from everyone was actually Evil Stepdad. But Hu Xiu’s parents failed their daughter. She was their only child and they couldn’t even spend time learning about what her dreams and goals were, nor did they reflect on their own actions and words.!<

>!Which then leads me to Pei Zhen, our ‘kinda’ 2^(nd) male lead (2ML) who is also the stepbrother to our male lead, Xiao Zhiyu. I know his character has a lot of fans, but I truly didn’t get his purpose. They wanted to show him as a rival to Xiao Zhiyu, but the scene where he kept faulting a child Xiao Zhiyu as a thief in their household made no sense to me and how he saw his stepbrother a rival. Pei Zhen grew up as the heir to a huge company, but behind closed doors, took vicious beatings by his dad. I know the drama intended to write him as a sad boy, and I feel Pei Zhen would have been the male lead in another drama. As a 2ML here, I think they were trying to go for how his character would be as: “what could have been/if only”. As in, if only he had chosen better, despite the circumstances he grew up in, maybe at the right time and place, he’d have met a Hu Xiu and been a better person. Anyway, it was hard for me to believe that he didn’t know or recognize the extent of how cruel and evil his dad was, given he was on the receiving end of some awful punishments—being clubbed with a golf club even as an adult.!<

>!His redemption was a bit late for me, but at least it was better late than never. Who we are is often defined by what we ultimately choose despite our circumstances.!<

>!A scene that sets Xiao Zhiyu and Pei Zhen a landslide apart is during their family meal with their parents. Pei Zhen mentions his ‘love’, or who he’s interested in boisterously. At this point, we know Xiao Zhiyu and Hu Xiu have made things official as a couple, but Xiao Zhiyu keeps quiet and remains nonchalant. He is protecting and shielding Hu Xiu in whatever ways he can, knowing how volatile and cruel his stepfather is. Whereas Pei Zhen is too blinded to see the bigger picture and how his open “affection” could implicate Hu Xiu.!<

>!Oh, and Pei Zhen keeping the band-aid Hu Xiu put on him, to going to Hu Xiu’s house, heartbroken to ask for another band-aid when he found out she’s with his stepbrother, to in the end, taking the band-aid out to look at…UM WHAT? If the drama wanted Pei Zhen to have a keepsake that Hu Xiu gave to him, then they should have written for Hu Xiu to give Pei Zhen a handkerchief or scarf. He could keep that without it being so weird. Anyway, no. No on so many levels for me.!<

>!Therein lies the juxtaposition between him and Xiao Zhiyu. Despite Xiao Zhiyu’s circumstances and the cards he was dealt with, he chose to still be a decent person. He sacrificed a lot for his mother’s happiness, the wet-sponge that she is, and he’s always been present with his quiet strength and resilience in the face of hardships. In another drama, Xiao Zhiyu’s characteristics would have made him the 2ML, but I do love that they switched it here. Pei Zhen presents as the rich, troubled, and broken heir, and in a different drama, the rich, broken heir is usually the male lead. Pei Zhen went through life essentially having everything he needed at the tips of his fingers, power and money. He could throw his weight around with that, and he did. Until he met Hu Xiu who caught him off guard.!<

>!I questioned often if Pei Zhen even truly fell for Hu Xiu. They didn’t have enough interaction for me to believe it. Sure, he might have a crush on her, given that she’s this beautiful, bright light that he’s witnessed. However, I couldn’t tell if it was genuinely that he was starting to fall for her, or simply he was after her because he didn’t want his stepbrother to ‘win’—which is something he’s admitted to Xiao Zhiyu later on, about wanting to best him on all fronts.!<

>!I think I would have also been okay if Hu Xiu happened to encounter Pei Zhen without Xiao Zhiyu and gave him some sage advice that helped him see things in a different light. The sad boy needs to heal, and maybe Hu Xiu can push him to go to therapy. LOL. I did appreciate Pei Zhen apologizing to Xiao Zhiyu though. It once again goes with the “what could have been/ if only” theme had they worked together as brothers, and what could have been with an endearing relationship had it not been tainted.!<

>!Another scene that I wanted them to do better for our girl, Hu Xiu, was when Hu Xiu entered the game again after she was rejected from Xiao Zhiyu. She thought it was going to be the other actor playing Commander Qian Xiao Yi that day, but turns out it was who she wanted to avoid- Xiao Zhiyu. They really should have played up on Hu Xiu’s intelligence. When she entered the game, she teamed up to try to get the ring from Commander Qian Xiao Yi but failed. He then told her to follow him if she wanted to ring, and that he’d make sure she stayed alive in the game. Hu Xiu reluctantly follows him until her feet hurt from the shoes she’s wearing in the game. The drama could have made it where Hu Xiu chooses not to follow Qian Xiao Yi/ Xiao Zhiyu, because she’s a smart cookie who would have been able to find another way to win the game. She could have ditched him and found out about the marriage certificate, and it still wouldn’t have taken away from that scene. Because the drama basically implied that had her shoes not hurt her, she would have continued to follow Qian Xiao Yi/ Xiao Zhiyu? She didn’t need his help, and I’d have loved that. The whole sequence leading up to her finding out his signature of “in your dreams” on the marriage certificate could have easily flowed into the scene where Hu Xiu confronts Xiao Zhiyu about what is really bothering her. Then when Xiao Zhiyu breaks character and pulls her into the alley and tells her, ”let’s not end things like this” BEFORE KISSING HER, with her consent, which is sweet, the scene would have been just as impactful if not more.!<

>!I wanted this consent as well before their passionate kiss when they had their tense conversation of Hu Xiu confronting Xiao Zhiyu about him either telling her everything, or letting her go. I think in this case, Xiao Zhiyu pulling her into a tight embrace would have actually been more powerful at first before there’s a kiss. But definitely this one I could forgive as well considering the high emotions running through our leading couple.!<

>!But I am also going to backtrack a little to their breakup. Personally, I felt it was stupidly written. I didn’t want a concert scene. I know it’s meant to be cute before this breakup happens, but I feel the drama could have made this even better. In fact, let’s have the date scene here where Hu Xiu and Xiao Zhiyu go to the tallest building he helped build that he promised his dad he one day would. Then when the news breaks of his real identity, courtesy of his stepbrother, Pei Zhen, and Hu Xiu’s parents are given supposedly damning information of how his dad was behind the stadium collapse that caused Hu Xiu’s dad to be paralyzed, let Xiao Zhiyu be the one to pull away from Hu Xiu. Let him be the noble idiot who now feels he doesn’t deserve Hu Xiu nor the happiness he has found with her. He can walk away without explaining anything after barely just starting to tell her about his dad and the building, only to stop when she gets the call from her parents about the information that implicated him as the son of the man who caused this pain. There did not need to be that stupid scene with Hu Xiu’s dad rushing out to find Hu Xiu and getting into an accident…for a man who’s already paralyzed. They’re going for the dramatic effect that wasn’t needed here.!<

>!This would be the perfect spot once again for our girl to shine! Hu Xiu can be taken aback by all this when Xiao Zhiyu leaves, as she processes everything. But once again, she would be too smart to let Xiao Zhiyu leave her like this. She would fight for the both of them when he didn’t have the strength or courage to do so.!<

>!I envision that she would be hurt at first, since he left her and initiated the breakup. But she would realize why he was pushing her away to protect her, and then she’d also talk to her parents and remind them how much she loves Xiao Zhiyu and that the children shouldn’t have to bear the burdens or sins of their parents. This would make sense too that despite his breakup to her, she’s still protecting him and doing what she can.!<

>!Their reunion scene when Xiao Zhiyu is in Rongcheng when the building set lights up before Hu Xiu goes barreling into his arms would have been so heartfelt following this without taking away anything from the intention of the scene. It would have still been seamless for her to declare that she just wants to love him and stand with him. And that no matter what happens, like the promise she made him agree to, about facing things together, would be what she’s calling in now. Our girl barrelling in like the love and light she is to Xiao Zhiyu aka Qian Xiao Yi.!<

>!Why didn’t Xiao Zhiyu, when all was said and done though, not actually be proud to use his father’s name after he was able to restore justice and dignity to his dad. (LOL about the reveal at one point where they posted the fake identity scandal online. I feel personally no one cares, because it wasn’t like his character was a popular movie star or some famous person in the drama.) He spent his life hiding his real name of Qian Xiao Yi, so it would have been a profoundly poignant moment to use his real name.!<

>!A HUGE let down for me was them jipping us out of a proposal and wedding. After all the ornaments and trinkets Hu Xiu collected from Qian Xiao Yi, her initial broken engagement with her ex, two white dresses-- one in the game and one in real life at the event, a marriage certificate in the game, and ring, why not! I am all for women chasing their dreams and making their goals a reality, but why can’t women do both? Why can’t Hu Xiu chase her career, fulfill her unfinished dreams, and also be married? I felt we were absolutely bamboozled on what could have been to this lovely, healing, heartfelt, love story.!<

>!The drama could have totally tied a wedding of sorts back into Rongcheng with the game, honoring the place where the leads first met. How befitting and PERFECT to have them get married in real life with Rongcheng as the wedding venue, and to have Xiao Zhiyu be married officially to Hu Xiu with his real name: Qian Xiao Yi, on the marriage certificate. Imagine the beautiful costumes they could have done for this in the Republic Era too. We got a glimpse of that with Hu Xiu’s white, cocktail dress in the game with her beautiful hairband. This is them…on their wedding day, okay? Lemme be delulu.!<

>!In fact! I think instead of when Xiao Zhiyu tells Hu Xiu to find the book, *Architecture in Love* by Hiroshi Nakamura, when she tells him she misses him…THEY COULD HAVE DONE A BLUEPRINT. Listen! Xiao Zhiyu aka Qian Xiao Yi could have suggested that when she is ready to marry him, this is going to be their future home he wants to build with her, with a blueprint of a home drawing inspiration of The Lanes where they were roommates. Or maybe he has blue prints of renovating the community of The Lanes Home to upgrade it but still keep its charm. The possibilities were there.!<

A girl can sigh and dream.

If you’ve read through all the critiques, thank you. I do love the drama so much despite my issues. In fact, let’s talk about the things I loved here. This drama was such an enigma for me to have gravitated towards, given how I never watch modern C-dramas.

Now, for the THINGS I LOVE about this drama. Unfortunately, because reddit limits the character I can post, this is the link to the rest of the review.

The last few of my friends who didn’t have kids yet recently had kids or got pregnant, and I’m starting to feel the effects of the loss of connection and decrease in socializing with the majority of my friends/coworkers. I still put in effort to see them when they’re able to (get coffee, go over to their house, attend the kids birthday parties, etc) but it’s getting harder to be the only CF person despite being so confident in my decision. I have a couple friends who are fence sitters and I think the possibility of losing them too will be hard. I started to notice I’ve been making more friends with people 5-6 years younger than me because they have the social bandwidth and budget to do the things I like to do (concerts, getting dinner at a new restaurant, paddle boarding etc), but one of those people got pregnant recently and it really stung for some reason. 

I’m super happy for my friends AND my husband and I are content in our decision. But I can’t help but feel left out of my friend’s lives when I crave friendship and connection. I’m thinking I probably need more CF friends, in the same way they need mom friends. 

Would love to hear anyone’s insights on how they navigated this, if they can relate.

1qy7e8f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy7e8f,Help!,"Hi Guys,

I bought my first ever home barista setup.

I grinded 36 grams of coffee at once.

(I wanted to make two cups)

The first 18 grams were pulled up in the portafilter, and when I turned on, the flow was not in a straight line (using bottomless portafilter) . It was coming from all holes and was really very watery. I was so lost in this that I forgot about the scale and the timer, and stop it at 45 seconds with around 40-45 ml shot.

If youre somebody in a wolf pack, life comes preloaded with comfort. Doors open. People smile. Youre protected. Youre provided for.

I used to live like thatright up until my dad died.

He was head warrior. He went down shielding the Alpha, and the second he was gone, my mom and I stopped mattering to the ones at the top.

Mom had never needed a job before. Shed met her mate at eighteen, had me, and built her whole world around home while Dad handled everything outside it.

That was five years ago.

Sometimes I still dont understand how she survived losing him. I dont understand how she kept breathing when her other half was suddenly justgone.

Shes the toughest woman Ive ever met. She had to be, after they stripped us of everythingour house, our car, the life wed been promised like it couldnt be touched.

Now we sit below even the omegas. Mom takes whatever dead-end shifts she can get, stringing them together to cover the inflated fees the Alpha dumps on us, just so we can eat.

And Ive watched her fade since Dad died. She barely eats. She works until shes a ghost. She doesnt take care of herself anymore. The old Alpha handed power to his son, and the new one is just as brutal, just as smug.

All Mom wants is for me to get out. To leave this pack behind and carve out something that isnt misery handed down like inheritance.

The morning I woke up on the couch, rain was hammering the trailer windows so hard it blurred the world outside. The sky looked like it had decided to punish everybody.

I slid off the couch and shuffled toward the kitchen, hunting for coffee.

Thats when I saw them: a handful of flowers, obviously picked by hand, standing in a chipped vase. A note was propped in front.

Happy Birthday Maddox,

Im sorry I cant be there to celebrate with you. But you have a good day. Youre finally 18. I cant believe it. Youve grown up so quick. I love you.

Love Mom.

Briars voice brushed my mind, warm and soft. She really does love us.

We know, I told her.

I know. Are you going to have anything besides coffee?

Yes, I saidand opened a drawer, pulling out a packet of cigarettes.

I stood by the tiny kitchen window, rain streaking the glass, and lit one.

Briar snapped, anxious. I still cant believe you stole those. If you get caught, youre done. The Alpha will toss you in the dungeon.

Relax, I muttered, exhaling. Nobody saw me.

Only because you got lucky.

I went into the bedroom and dug through my side of the only closet we had. Frayed jeans. Black T-shirt. Black boots. I slung my bag over my shoulder, tugged on a raincoat, and stepped out of the trailer Mom and I shared.

The walk to school always took about thirty minutes. The pack had pushed us as far away as they could manage, dumped near the treeline in a stretch that felt like nowhereno neighbors, barely any patrols, just mud and quiet.

By the time I reached the building, I looked like Id been dragged out of a lake.

I peeled off my raincoat, shoved it into my locker, and started yanking out books for first period. The bell was close.

Footsteps and voices rolled down the hall toward me. A group.

I glanced over and recognized every face. Some used to be friends. Some Id never wanted near me to begin with.

Now they all hated me. Being looked down on by omegas wasnt normal, but Mom and I were a special kind of unwanted.

They passed, and I kept my eyes on my lockeruntil the guy in front drove his shoulder into me.

My face hit metal. Pain flared, sharp and hot.

Laughter trailed after them as they kept moving. I drew back, touched near my eye, and felt wetnessblood.

Asshole, I spat.

They stopped.

Ryker turned first, like he owned the corridor. What did you just call me?

You heard me.

He handed his bag off to one of his friends and came closer. He tried to loom, but at six-one I didnt give him much room to tower.

You should watch your mouth, he said, voice slick with threats. Or we can take this behind the gym. I heard youll spread your legs for anyone if it means you get fed.

He reached up and brushed hair away from my face like he had the right.

I slapped his hand aside.

His expression twisted, and then he grabbed my arms and slammed me back into the lockers.

A ring of students began to form, hungry for it.

Dont you ever put your hands on me again, tramp, he hissed. I outrank you.

Go to hell, I growled.

His palm cracked across my face.

My head snapped, and when I brought my hand to my mouth, there was blood.

You little slut.

I stared him down. You know what your problem is?

He sneered. And whats that?

Youre too close.

I drove my forehead into his face.

He stumbled back, hands flying off my arms. Blood poured from his nose when he lifted his head.

I stepped away from the lockers, shoulders loose, ready.

Youre dead now, Ryker snarled, charging.

I slipped to the side, caught a fistful of his hair, and slammed his head into the locker. Then my knee went into his stomach.

He folded.

I kneed him in the face while he was bent over, and that finished ithe hit the floor on his back.

His friends shifted like they wanted to rush me. I could feel it building. Wolves didnt fight alone. They swarmed.

Then a voice thundered from the far end of the hall. What the hell is going on?

The crowd scattered instantly, as if fear had been waiting for permission. In seconds it was just me, Ryker on the ground, and a couple of his boys lingering.

Principal Graham stormed toward us.

Shit, I muttered.

He stopped near us, eyes hard. I asked you. What the hell is going on here?

Queenie stepped forward, already smiling like shed been given a gift. Rykers girlfriend. My ex best friend.

Isnt it obvious? she said. That trash attacked Ryker.

Graham didnt look at me. He aimed his irritation at Rykers friends instead. Get him up. Take him to the nurse. Hes bleeding all over my floor.

They hauled Ryker away.

Graham turned back to me and tried to use his height like a weapon, leaning in with intimidation. What do you have to say for yourself?

Does it matter? I asked. Are you going to believe a word I say?

His jaw tightened. My office. Now.

I shut my locker and followed him.

When I opened the office door, my stomach dropped.

Beta Lynxs stood inside in a crisp three-piece suit, like he belonged in a boardroom instead of a school.

Graham entered behind me and immediately bared his neck in respect.

I didnt.

I didnt respect anyone in this pack anymore, and I hadnt for a long time.

Whats this about? I asked.

Beta Lynxs didnt bother with explanations. Youre coming with me.

I have class.

His gaze pinned me. Are you refusing a direct order?

So I went.

Outside, his car waited at the front. I got in, and we drove through town toward the packhouse.

The closer we got, the tighter my chest felt.

Inside, everything looked almost exactly like it had five years ago. The big living room still sat to the right, polished and smug.

Beta Lynxs led me left instead, through adjoining rooms and down a hallway that felt longer than it should have.

We stopped at a heavy mahogany door.

He knocked.

A deep voice carried through the wood, telling him to enter.

Beta Lynxs opened it, and I stepped into the office first.

The door closed behind me.

The room was enormous, dominated by a massive desk. Alpha Landon sat behind it, immaculate in another perfectly pressed three-piece suit.

He lifted his eyes.

And the second I saw himhis sharply sculpted face, slicked-back brown hair, green staremy balance wavered.

Then his scent hit.

Briar surged in my head like shed been set on fire, and I had to grip the back of a chair to keep from swaying.

Mate, I said, the word leaving me like an accident.

Shock locked my bones in place.

Chapter 2

Alpha Landon stayed behind his desk and just watched melong enough that the silence started to itch. I couldnt tell what had flipped in him, only that something had.

At last he rose and circled out from behind the desk, tugging at his suit like a man trying to iron himself while he walked. He caught his own reflection in the cabinet window and checked it, then kept coming.

He stopped near me, braced a hand on the desktop, and steadied himself like he didnt trust his legs.

You knew, I said, the words scraping out.

Im twenty-four, he answered flatly. Of course I knew.

And you never said a thing.

I realized you were my mate when I was eighteen. He pushed his hair back, neat and practiced. You were twelve. I wasnt about to tell a kid she was tied to the future Alpha. And its better that I didnt.

Betterwhy?

Because no one can know, he said. You rank lower than an omega.

That made my chest go tight. And whose doing is that? You abandoned me and my mom after my dad diedjust to protect your father, by the way.

His eyes sharpened. Dont get mouthy with me, girl. We arent digging up yesterday. Were deciding what happens now. Sit.

He dragged the chair out from the desk like it was a command made of wood and metal.

I stepped in, and my lungs locked up as I passed him. I held my breath until I could drop into the seat.

He returned to the other side and lowered himself into a huge leather chair, undoing his jacket button before he settled, like even stress had to follow etiquette.

Can you just finish this? I asked. I have to get back to school.

Finish what? His brow creased.

The rejection.

I never told you I was rejecting you.

Now it was my turn to stare. Then I dont get it. You just said youre glad nobody knows. If youre so ashamed, why not reject me?

His mouth tightened. Everyone knows rejecting a fated mate brings bad luck. Its an insult to the Moon Goddess who matched us. She mustve had a reasoncant say I see itbut Im not inviting an omen. With this packs past, I dont need more rot clinging to us.

So that means you keep me? Im your mate and your Luna?

No. His voice cut hard. Absolutely not. Nobody will know were mates. I wont reject you, but you wont move into the packhouse. We wont behave like were togethernot dating, not bonded, nothing. If I require you for anything tied to Alpha duties, Ill call for you. Otherwise, we stay away from each other.

And you keep parading that fake girlfriend around, I said, so everyone keeps believing the picture you want.

Yes, he replied, calm as paperwork. Im glad thats clear.

I didnt say I agreed. Whats stopping me from telling everyone?

He didnt even flinch. Whos going to take your word over mine? And even if a few do, I deny it and it dies right there. Theyll turn on you for accusing their Alpha.

My hands curled. So what am I supposed to dowait around forever and jump when you snap your fingers? What if I want college after graduation? What if I want a life that isnt scraping by on dead-end jobs like my mom?

Youve got a few months until you finish school, he said, already sliding back into that distant voice. Well revisit it then. For now, you know how this works. You can go.

His pen was in his hand again; his attention had already moved on.

I stood on legs that didnt feel like mine, crossed to the door, and pulled it open.

Phoebe was right therewaiting like she belonged in the doorway. The dress clung to her like paint and stopped just past her ass, leaving almost everything that shouldve been covered on display. Her makeup was piled on heavy, and her long brown hair fell in polished curls down her back. Four-inch heels lifted her, but she still wasnt as tall as I was.

Sweetheart, she purred toward Landon, then flicked her gaze at me like I was something stuck to a shoe. Why are you wasting time on this trash?

Landon came up behind me. It was just another school fight.

Phoebe huffed. Were going to be late for lunch. You told me you were taking me into the city today, and its an hour drive.

I know, sweetie. Im sorry. His tone softened for her in a way it never did for me. Give me a minute and well go. And MaddoxIll talk to you later.

I didnt answer. I walked out, down the hall, and aimed for the front doors of the packhouse.

The second I hit the outside air and got down the steps, it felt like my ribs finally unlocked.

I stood there and pulled in a few deep breaths.

Beta Lynxs came onto the veranda and watched me. For a second, his face looked not kind, exactly, but close to pity.

I didnt buy it. Nobody pitied me.

I headed toward town, and there was no chance I was going back to school today.

Why doesnt he want us? Briars voice whined inside me.

Because hes an arrogant ass, I muttered.

Maddox, she protested, wounded. Hes our mate. Dont you want to go back and be with him?

Why would I?

Im in you, she said, pressing. You cant pretend. You hurt too.

Yeah, I snapped. And? It changes nothing.

We could go back and make him look at us. Make him pay attention.

He doesnt care, I said. If we push, we end up in the dungeon, and Mom doesnt need that hanging over her. Im getting through graduation, then Im taking Mom and Im leaving this place behind.

Briar kept whining anyway.

What about our mate?

I dont care, I said, voice raw. How many ways do you need it said? He doesnt want us, so why would we want him?

Because he loves us, she insisted. He just doesnt know it yet.

I cant do this right now, Briar.

I shoved her back in my mind until her voice dulled to a distant ache.

Instead of looping the block, I cut into a narrow alleyfaster, quieter.

Ryker stepped out from behind a dumpster like hed been waiting for the exact moment.

I froze. Then Dominic and Jordan appeared behind him.

I turned to retreatand Adrian and Blake slid in from that end, closing the exit.

I let out a short laugh that didnt have any humor in it. Wow. Guess were not aiming for fair today.

Thats the idea. Ryker grinned. You might be able to fight one-on-one, but Im not getting humiliated by worthless trash like you again.

He lifted something, letting it catch the light.

My fathers watch.

The one hed stolen from my locker.

Give it back, I said.

Take it, he shot back, laughing.

The circle tightened as his friends crept closer. My pulse slammed, stomach flipping, heat stinging behind my eyes. Tears threatened, sharp at the edgesbut I forced them down. I couldnt show them anything. Not to Ryker. Not to any of them.

Oh, look at her, Ryker called to the others. Shes gonna cry.

I set my stance anyway, hands up, body ready.

I knew the truth: I couldnt beat five wolves by myself. Not all at once.

They advanced, and I shifted to keep from getting pinned against brick or cornered. My eyes kept flicking to the watch in his hand, like if I stared hard enough it would come back to me.

It wasnt going to be clean. It never was.

Rykers fist cracked into my face, spinning me.

Jordan drove a kick into my stomach.

Someone grabbed me from behind and tried to haul me upright; I snapped my head back and smashed it into him.

Then all four of the others surged in together, and whatever chance Id had disappeared under their weight.

Chapter 3

LANDONS POV

The second Maddox walked out of my office, my focus went with her. I tried to force my eyes back to the paperwork, but the pages might as well have been written in another language.

Phoebe slipped inside, perched on my lap like she belonged there, and kept talking while I stared at the mess on my desk.

A few minutes ago, everything had been clear. Now all I could register was Maddoxs scent lingering in the air, circling the room like it had a claim.

How did I let this happen? Id had a plan. When she turned eighteen, I was going to reject herclean, final, necessary. An omega mate was impossible. The pack would never accept it.

And then she stepped through my door, and the rejection died in my throat.

Landon, Phoebe said, sharp with impatience. Are you even hearing me?

I blinked. Sorry. Im distracted. What was that?

My uncle wants a meeting. As soon as you can manage it.

Tell him Im available whenever he is, I said.

Phoebe tilted her head. Hes an Alpha too. He doesnt exactly sit around waiting.

I get it. Set it up, I said.

My wolfs voice raked through my skull. Can you get this rancid bitch off of us?

Shut it, I muttered.

We just saw our mate, Lynx snapped, and youve got this thing draped all over you. What is wrong with you?

You know I cant end it, I shot back.

Because you want her uncles alliance, he growled. So get it, put it in writing, and dump her. He cant back out if its sealed.

The pressure behind my eyes built until it hurt. I shoved Lynx down, forcing him to the back of my mind, just to buy myself silence.

He wanted Maddox. So did I.

For years I had kept my distance on purposeavoided the same rooms, the same events, any chance of being close enough to feel the pull. Id made sure of it.

Seeing her today cracked something open anyway.

Id known the mate bond was powerful. I hadnt understood it could be like this. When Id first found her at twelve, it had been a distant, one-sided tugsomething I could ignore.

Now it was a hook in my ribs, and I had no idea what to do with it.

And I couldnt stop thinking about how vicious Id been to her.

She hadnt deserved any of it.

I still didnt know what I was going to do.

Phoebe stood, tugging at my arm. Come on. Its lunch.

Yesterday her hands on me had felt right. Today her closeness made my skin crawl.

I need to finish a couple things, I said, trying to slide back into my chair.

Itll be there after you eat, she said, tightening her grip. Get up.

Phoebe always got her way. No one had ever taught her what no meant, so she treated it like a joke.

I let her drag me out of the packhouse and into my black Mercedes parked out front.

The moment the door shut, I reached out through the link.

Beta Lynxs.

Yes, Alpha, he answered.

Maddox Jensen. The girl who just left my office, I sent. I want eyes on her.

Understood. Anything specific you want reported?

Everything, I replied.

Phoebe directed the driver straight to the most expensive restaurant in town. They kept a private room in the back for meno reservations, no waiting.

We sat down. I didnt bother opening the menu; I already knew it by heart. We ordered, and Phoebe kept chattering without taking a breath.

I used to find it charming.

Now it was noise.

My thoughts kept rewinding to Maddox in my officehow small shed been the last time Id truly looked at her. She wasnt a kid anymore. Shed grown into someone striking, nothing like the worn-down figure Id expected after my father declared her family omegas.

Theyd been demoted, shoved down the packs ladder, and yet she looked like shed somehow held herself together.

That surprised me.

Then Lynxs hit my mind like a scream.

Alpha!

My stomach dropped. What is it?

Maddox is in trouble, he said. Shes been taken to the hospital.

I was already pushing back from the table.

I have to leave, I told Phoebe.

She stared. What? Our food isnt even here.

Pack business, I said, and I didnt slow down as I cut through the restaurant.

I drove too fast.

At the hospital, the energy around the emergency wing was wronghurried movement, clipped voices. I tracked it to a room with people shifting in and out and approached the doorway carefully.

Inside, a man was yanking at Maddoxs shirt like he had a right to touch her.

He didnt smell like staff.

I stormed in, grabbed him, and slammed him into the wall hard enough to rattle the room.

Who the hell are you, I snarled, and why are you undressing her?

He flinched but didnt fold. Carter. I found her in an alley. She was getting beaten, and these doctors and nurses werent doing a damn thing to help her.

I tightened my grip. What are you talking about?

Im telling you, he insisted. She needs help and theyre just standing around.

I hauled him back out into the hall without letting go and spotted a doctor at the desk.

Why arent you treating the girl in that room? I demanded.

The doctor turned, expression stiff. Sir, she was just brought in. Andshes Maddox Jensen.

I dont care who she is, I said, voice rising. Get in there and save her fucking life. Now.

The doctor paled and moved. Nurses followed, rushing into the room and finally surrounding Maddox with purpose.

Carter cleared his throat. Can you let go of me?

No, I said. You still owe me answers.

I was trying to see how bad it was, he said. No one else was bothering.

And you found her how?

I work at the cafe next to the alley, he said. I took the trash out and saw five guys on her. She wasnt fightingshe was on the ground. I got them to back off and before they left, they put this on her.

He held up a watch.

My chest went tight. I knew it.

Her fathers.

My father had given it to him before he died.

Get out, I said, releasing him.

Carter stumbled away and disappeared down the corridor.

Through the doorway, I watched them work on her. Tests. Scans. Whispered updates that didnt sound hopeful.

Time stretched into hours.

People kept trying to reach me. I ignored every call, every message, every demand. None of it mattered.

Eventually they moved Maddox into a private room. I took the chair beside her bed and didnt budge.

When the doctor came in, I stood before he could speak. Whats wrong?

Were transfusing blood and starting IV antibiotics, he said carefully. Shes in a coma. Brain swelling from the beating. It should go down, but we dont know when.

Get out, I ordered.

He left at once.

I sat again and reached for Maddoxs hand.

Warm.

Alive.

Something electric skittered over my skinsparks tracing up my fingers, along my wrist, into my arm. The bond reacting, insisting.

I didnt want to release her. I didnt want to be anywhere else.

My phone rang again. Phoebes name flashed across the screen.

I let it ring.

All I could do was stare at Maddox and pray the mate bond did what it was supposed to do. I had been cruel to her earliercold, dismissive, calculated.

Now all I wanted was for her to open her eyes.

I didnt know how long I sat there. A nurse slipped in a few times to check vitals, noticed my hand locked around Maddoxs, and said nothing.

Shed been told not to.

Lynxs stayed outside the door, keeping everyone else out. I didnt have the strength to Alpha-order the whole floor into obedience.

I couldnt remember ever feeling this low.

People always said Maddox was a fighter.

So why hadnt she fought?

Even outnumbered, she should have left marks. Defensive wounds. Something.

There were hardly any.

And I couldnt stop the thought that it had been because of me. What Id said. What Id done.

Like Id broken something in her.

She was hanging on by a thread, and I had helped push her there.

Then her fingers twitched in my grasp.

I snapped upright.

Her lashes fluttered. Her eyes opened slowly, unfocused at first. I pulled my hand back and leaned into the chair, forcing distance I didnt want.

Confusion crossed her face as she took in the room, the tubes, the quiet. Then her gaze found me.

What happened? she rasped.

You were attacked, I said, voice tight. A dishwasher carried you here. Youve got his scent all over you.

Lynx surged.

I stood too fast and leaned over her, teeth practically bared. Why the hell was that dishwasher so interested in you?

Chapter 4

MADDOXS POV

I was lying in that hospital bed, locked on Alpha Landons stare, trying to make his words line up into something that made sense.

What the hell are you even talking about? My voice came out rough.

The dishwasher who dragged you in, he snapped.

I dont know who you mean, I said.

The one from Angel Cafe, he clarified.

It took a beatfoggy, slowbefore it clicked.

Carter? I asked.

Yeah. His lip curled. I had the nurse burn your clothes. They reeked of him.

So what are you actually asking me? I shot back.

Why was he so damn focused on you?

I dont know. He works with my mom.

He looked like he wanted to laugh at that. You expect me to buy that?

Its true, I said, jaw tight. I dont know what else you want. I scanned the room, panic creeping in. Wheres my mother?

I havent called her.

Good. I didnt hesitateI yanked the IV from my arm and tore the leads off my chest.

The monitors immediately lost their minds. A doctor and a nurse rushed in as I swung my legs over the side of the bed.

What the hell are you doing? the doctor demanded.

Leaving. I cant stay here, I said.

You have to. He pressed a hand to my shoulder, trying to shove me back down. You had a serious head injury.

No. I fought him. We cant afford this.

The doctor looked past me. Wheres her mother?

Dont call her, I said fast. Dont tell her any of it. She has enough on her plate. Just let me goI have to get home. I searched again. Where are my clothes?

I told you, Landon said, eyes cold. Theyre gone.

If youre leaving, you need to sign an AMA release, the doctor said.

Then bring it. I held his stare until he and the nurse left.

The second they were gone, I sat there gripping my side, breaths shallow. Id moved too fast and only now realized how badly my ribs had been damagedbroken, probably. But my arm and ankle were screaming louder, so thats what Id been noticing.

Landon kept watching me. I caught his gaze, so I forced my hand away from my ribs and straightened up like nothing hurt.

All I could think about was the bill. How was I supposed to pay for any of this?

When I glanced at him again, his face looked less hard, for half a second. Then he noticed me looking and shut it down, turning away like it had never happened.

The doctor returned with paperwork, but he insisted on checking me over first.

Fine, I said. Just be quick.

He worked through my injuries one by one, inspecting the stitches scattered across my body.

Thats odd, he muttered.

What is?

These injuries shouldnt have closed up already. He frowned, clinical and confused. Youre dehydrated, underfed. That part isnt unusual for a werewolf of your rankbut you shouldnt be healing at this pace.

My rank? I snapped, heat rising. My father was head warrior. A fighter. And I am too. Thats one thing this pack hasnt taken from me.

Landon leaned against the wall, watching me lay into the doctor. I couldve sworn amusement flickered across his face.

After I signed, the doctor finally left. Then it was just me, limping out in a hospital gown on a wrecked ankle, trying to be grateful it actually tied in the back.

Were not done, Landon said as I made for the exit.

Done with what?

With what we said before.

I laughed without humor. What, the part where I act like we dont mean anything to each other? Isnt that the assignment?

Then why do you smell like another man?

Because he saved my life. My temper snapped. Why do you smell like some other bitch?

His head jerked up, eyes sharp. He hadnt expected me to bite back.

Shes my girlfriend, he said, voice flat with authority. And Im your Alpha. I can do whatever I want.

Then so can I. The words came fast, ugly. If you get to parade around with that plastic excuse for a werewolf, I get to do what I want too. And I dont know why youre so madnobody cares about me like that. Not here. Your father made sure of it.

Dont talk about my father.

Then stop talking to me. I pushed myself upright. I have to get something back. Its mine.

I put weight down wrongstraight onto the fractured ankleand the room tilted. I nearly hit the floor, but Landon surged forward and caught me.

The instant his hands closed around my arms, a jolt raced through mesparks down to my fingertips, heat climbing my chest and throat. It was unfamiliar, violent in a way that didnt hurt.

I lifted a hand to my side, feeling for the ribs that had been agony a moment earlier. The pain was still there, but dulledlike it had been turned down.

I looked up at him, silent.

He released me the moment he could, like touching me had burned.

I have to go, I said, turning away and limping out.

He followed me beyond the room. What are you going to find?

My fathers watch. I kept moving. I lost it. I need it back.

You mean this?

I spun. He was holding it out in his hand.

Where did you get that?

The dishwasher had it, he said. He said it was with you when he brought you in.

I limped back, palm extended.

Slowly, he set the watch into my hand.

Relief hit me so hard I sagged. Thank you, I managed, then turned and kept going.

Landonthere you are! A shrill voice ricocheted behind me. What the hell is going on? Ive had you on hold all day.

I didnt need to look. I knew it was Phoebe, and I didnt give her the satisfaction of seeing my face as she draped herself over him.

By the time I reached home, the walk had wrung me out. I dropped onto the couch the second I got inside.

Well, Briar said, that was a day.

Im really not in the mood, I told her.

A knock hit the door. I tried to stand, but my ankle and ribs lit up so badly I couldnt even get upright.

Come in, I called.

The door opened. Alpha Landon walked into my living room like he owned the air.

I just sat there, stunned, words jammed in my throat.

He turned toward meand his eyes shifted color. He was fighting his wolf, wrestling for control right in front of me.

I didnt know what Id done to set him off this badly, but he prowled over and stopped, towering above me.

No more fucking lies, he said, each word crushed out between clenched teeth.

I havent lied to you.

Bullshit. His voice dropped. How many?

What?

He grabbed the front of my hospital gown and hauled me up off the couch like I weighed nothing.

How many boys are you screwing? he growled, still shaking with the effort of holding his wolf back.

I shoved his hands away and limped across the roombarely five feetputting distance between us.

There arent any, I snapped. What is wrong with you?

Just Carter, then?

Its not Carter. My chest tightened, anger and exhaustion tangling together. I was attacked in the alley next to his work. Thats probably why he found me. He knows me because my mom works at the same cafeone of the million jobs she has to take because you charge her extra for everything.

His expression tightened. Do you think I like doing this?

You look like you love it, I said.

He stepped closer. I backed away until my shoulders hit the wall.

I braced for sharp pain in my ribsbut when I made contact, it was only a muted ache. It didnt make sense. Minutes ago it had been almost unbearable.

Landons hand rose. He slid it around my throat, not squeezingyet. A smirk pulled at his mouth like he was feeding off the fear on my face.

Was he really about to kill me?

Chapter 5

I held Alpha Landons stare and, inch by inch, lifted my hand until my palm settled over his. A strange peace settled through me with him that close, and I eased his fingers off my throat.

Why does it hurt less when youre here? I asked.

His expression shiftedtight and stormy. Torn. Lost. Angry. Feelings Id never watched cross his face before.

Its the mate bond, he said, forcing the words out like they tasted wrong. Thats why hospital beds are oversized. When someones admitted, their mate stays. They heal quicker.

I nodded, but Briar started whimpering inside my head.

Then I caught ithis scent, tangled up with something else. Someone else.

I shoved him back and headed for the kitchen.

Get out, I said. I yanked a cigarette from the cupboard and perched on the bench by the window.

What?

I can smell that bitch on you, I snapped. What is thissome kind of punishment? Because I dont even know what I did that made you hate me this much.

Shes my girlfriend, he shot back. What do you want from me?

Leave her, I said. You dont want me with anyone else, so maybe follow your own rules. Or is hurting your mate your favorite hobby?

I never said I enjoyed hurting you, he barked. But Im not dumping her like shes nothing. Weve been together two years. She deserves an explanation.

Fine, I bit out. Explain that shes a bitch. At least youd be telling the truth.

Stop calling her that! he yelled. I love her.

I just stared, like my brain couldnt decide what to do with those words.

Briar lunged for control, furious and raw, and I shoved her back down with everything I had. Alpha Landon watched it happening like he could see the fight under my skin.

Get out, I said again, turning my face to the glass.

I cant just break up with her, he said, quieter now.

I dont care, I muttered. Just leave me alone.

I didnt look over, but I heard the front door open, then shut. When I finally turned, he was gone.

Briar was a mess inside me, and I wiped at my eyesagain.

This is such bullshit, I whispered. Ive cried more in one day than I have in my entire life.

He does love us, Briar insisted.

Dont lie to yourself, I told her. He doesnt care about us.

I hope he does, she said, small and shaking. We cant keep living like this. Today has been hell.

Itll be fine, I said, even though it felt like an empty promise. Well survive it. We always do.

I showered, brushed out my ass-length snow-blonde hair, and twisted it up before collapsing onto the couch.

Mom didnt come home until late. She looked so wrecked I honestly thought she might be sleepwalking.

Hi, honey, she murmured.

Hi. How was your day? I asked.

She turned fully toward me, and her eyes widened.

Apparently better than yours, she said, hurrying over. What the hell happened?

Oh, dont worry about it, I said.

What do you mean dont worry? Your head is wrapped, your arm is broken

And my ankles fractured, I added. But Ill live.

Maddox, what happened?

I fell down the stairs at school, I said. Its nothing. Just stupid. Mostly embarrassing.

Her gaze narrowed, searching.

Are you sure?

What?

Are you sure you tripped, she asked carefully, and you werent pushed?

Yes, I said, forcing it to sound simple. Im sure. You worry too much, Mom. It was my fault.

Okay, she said, still not convinced. I hope so. Do you have painkillers?

No. I dont need any. I hesitated. Can I talk to you for a minute? Or are you too exhausted?

I can give you a minute, she said, sitting beside me.

So Ill be graduating in a couple months, I began. And Ive already been accepted into a bunch of werewolf colleges across the country.

I know, she said, pride softening her face. Im so proud of you.

Ive been thinking, I said. I think we should both go.

Her eyebrows jumped. What are you talking about?

When I leave for college, I said, I want you to come with me. You could get a better job out there. I looked into itwaitresses in the real world make double what you make here. You wouldnt have to work yourself into the ground.

She blinked at me. Youre serious.

Completely, I said. Why wouldnt I be?

Maddox, she said softly, your father is buried here. I dont want to leave him.

I know, I said. We can come back. We can visit him and bring flowers. Ill pick a college close enough that we can drive back on weekends.

She leaned back, the weight of it hitting her. I dont know. Ive never even thought about leaving. Thats a lot.

Just think about it, I said. Really think. I mean it. I dont want you stuck here alone.

She gave me a tired little smile. Im supposed to be taking care of you.

Weve always taken care of each other, I said.

Yeah, she agreed. We have. Okay. Ill think about it. I promise.

Thank you, I said.

Alright, she murmured, pushing herself up. I need a shower and sleep. Im up again in a few hours.

Okay.

She kissed my forehead and disappeared toward the bathroom.

After she showered and got ready for bed, the apartment went quiet again.

I dragged my blanket and pillow to the couchmy bedand lay there staring at the ceiling.

Mom would want to know Id met my mate. But I couldnt do that to her. Alpha Landons father was the one who ruined our lives. Our father died because of him.

I couldnt tell her I was mated to his arrogant, entitled son.

Not long after, muffled sobs drifted from her bedroom.

Right on schedule. Every nightafter she crawls into bed and has to face the empty space where my father should have beenshe breaks.

She cries until sleep takes her.

Tonight it didnt go on for long, and I was relieved in the worst way, because there was nothing I could do. Listening to her hurt like that made me sick.

Eventually I fell asleep.

I didnt know how long it lasted before I snapped awake with a vicious, slicing pain in my stomach.

I tumbled off the couch onto my hands and knees, yanked my pillow down after me, and shoved my face into it so my mother wouldnt hear me scream. I had never felt anything like it.

And I had just been beaten by five werewolves.

This was worseso much worse.

What was wrong with me?

hey everyone, figured i'd share a quick heads-up on parking for the bloodshot bill show at dirty laundry on sunday, 02/08, because parking in that mills 50 district can be a real headache if you don't know the drill. it’s a tiny venue (right next to will’s pub) with zero dedicated parking, so you gotta strategize.  
  
first thing, if you want the absolute easiest experience, check out prked. it's an app where local residents around 1042 n mills ave rent out their private driveways or garage spots for the night. honestly, it’s a lifesaver. you pre-book a spot right next to dirty laundry for way cheaper than a sketchy lot, skip all the traffic circling the block, and it’s a short walk. highly recommend for any show here.  
  
if you're going for the free options, the best news is that the show is at 4:00 pm on a sunday. this is key. nearly all of the city of orlando's on-street metered parking spaces are free on sundays. this is your best bet. start your search on n mills ave itself, and then branch off onto the smaller side streets around the venue. locals often recommend side streets like n thornton ave or just pulling into the adjacent neighborhoods. just make sure you’re not blocking a driveway or parking in an area clearly marked ""permit required"" or ""private lot."" always read the signs.  
  
because it's an earlier show (4pm doors), you should find plenty of spots, as the major parking problems usually start when the bars and clubs get going later at night. still, try to get there at least 15-20 minutes before doors open just to give yourself time to walk a couple blocks, because those close-in free spots go fast.  
  
for paid alternatives, you can look for the small private lots behind some of the businesses nearby, like the lot near lazy moon/lineage coffee, which is a walkable option. these are usually clearly signed and managed by companies like pmc. there's also a pmc lot a bit south at 736 n mills ave, but that’s a decent walk. always pay if it asks you to; they tow relentlessly in mills 50.  
  
finally, the venue itself recommends rideshare services during peak hours. since the event is right in the heart of the action, getting dropped off/picked up is super easy and might be worth it to avoid the hassle altogether.  
  
hope this helps and you have a great time at the show.",1,1770448470.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

We planned to watch the Dracula movie that came out today and he brought me roses (my fav flowers) and snacks coffee etc.. he initiated and asked me how I’m feeling today emotionally from the betrayal, if I needed anything and let me speak on my feelings and he listened and replied with love and reassurance.

It was a fun night as he made sure I was smiling and he smiled saying he loves seeing me starting to be happy again even just a smile.

When the movie was almost over there was a line that was said and it was the same name as the girl he slept with, (her name is destiny) that word is very hard to avoid especially as a renaissance/book/fantasy lover, that word hurts deep now knowing I wasn’t his only girl in his eyes, knowing he didn’t choose me and protected me.. I’m a big “men who yearn” girl if this makes more sense..

Anyway when they said that word (her name) it hurt soo deep like dang I finally had a good day and didn’t think of the betrayal or her once today, and I just got it slammed in my face from a movie I was soo excited to watch. It was supposed to be my movie.

(She has the same interests and she was similar to me so it hit harder because I feel like everything I like she’s just stained on it so that’s why it hurt. Like not again.)

But He noticed it instantly and he instantly grabbed my hand and apologized to me. He kept saying he loves me and he’s so sorry that it got brought up from the movie he knew I was excited for weeks for. The relief he gave me is something I can’t even express so it made me cry and he was there for me during it and didn’t defended he just kept saying how truly sorry he was and that he’ll hold me and I can cry for as long as I need cause he’ll never let go until I’m okay.

We’re at his place now, eating some dinner he cooked and the night is almost over but I wanted to write this all down for my emotions and to look back on progress.

Hope you all have a good night, and I hope for those betrayed get that relief feeling like I did in their journey at least once. I know it wasn’t a full positive day but for me it was Because it truly felt like a step in helping repair my safety with him again. thanks for reading my emotions!🖤",4,1770448423.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,4,1.0,False

Initially I thought it’s the rice cooker. Maybe I didn’t clean it properly. I’ve tried using soap, vinegar and diluted bleach, but nope still getting diarrhea.

Okay so I thought it’s the rice cooker itself. So I swapped the rice cooker 8 times, each time using a different brand. But nope still getting diarrhea.

And then I thought it must be the way I cooked and prepared food in the kitchen. So I cleaned every surface and corner of the kitchen. But nope still getting diarrhea.

And then I thought it must be some sort of food intolerance. So I stopped eating gluten, spicy food, coffee, milk, etc. But nope still getting diarrhea.

And then I thought it must be my cat! He spents a lot of time in the litter box and must have stepped on poop. So I gave him a bath and try to avoid being close to him. But nope still getting diarrhea.

And then I thought it must be something in the room , some kind of dust, particles or something. So I bought an air filter and turned it on 24/7. But nope still getting diarrhea.

I saw the doctor multiple times complaining about this issue, but she just told me to add more fiber.

A month ago I discovered whenever I stopped eating rice. Things seem to get better…but if it’s not the rice cooker, then what is it?

Turns out it was the rice. The uncooked rice must have gotten wet somehow. Wetting uncooked rice activates Bacillus cereus spores, which produces toxins that cannot be killed during the cooking process.

So I bought a new bag of rice yesterday, and cooked  and ate it yesterday and today. I can confirm I don’t have diarrhea anymore.

So whilst suffering from severe diarrhea for almost a year, I’ve still managed to work, train for marathons and managed to stay alive.

TLDR: I had diarrhea almost everyday for more than a year and unable to discover the root cause until now; it was due to bacteria toxin from wetted uncooked rice.",98,1770448092.0,tifu,56,0.74,False

Made 2 cups:

**Cup 1:**

Beans: Ethiopian Guji Shakiso (Carbonic Maceration)  
Ratio: 1:16 (20g:320g)  
Grind Size: 18 clicks on the Timemore C2

Extraction Time: 3:30 minutes

Taste - Bitter and astringent, barely tasted any fruity notes. Thought it might be due to the beans being Carbonic Maceration processed, which is something I never had before.

**Cup 2:**

Beans: Colombian Orange Striped Wush Wush (Anaerobic Natural)  
Ratio: 1:16 (15g:240g)

Grind Size: 20 clicks on the Timemore C2

Extraction Time: 3:00 minutes

Taste - Similar to cup 1, bitter and astringent. Barely any acidity or fruitiness. Adjusted grind size 2 clicks coarser than my first cup since I thought i might have been grinding too fine, but still getting the same amount of astringency and bitterness.

Super weird because with my previous bag of Ethiopian naturals my cups tasted fruit-forward and quite clean with a slightly more intense body than a regular v60.

When we got back to the condo later… it was so hard to even look around. Her rocking chair that she watches hockey from. Her coffee station in the kitchen. Everything in the condo is hers. Her work from home office and computer. Everything is a reminder that she will die very soon and never get to see this place again… how do i help my husband cope with being in the condo? We will inherit it and continue to live here because housing is insane in canada. I know theres nothing i can do or say. Hes her only son, thats his only mother. I wish i could take this pain away. I am broken . She is a great woman, great mother, and inspiration. But she is a shell of herself. How do we move on? :( should we be there when she dies?

Ive just been looking into BPD, and I see a lot of the symptoms within myself. I wanted to share and get advice from people diagnosed with BPD to get an idea on if I should see a therapist or not. All love and respect!

I have a really hard time regulating my emotions. A lot of the times the most minor inconveniences ruin my day. For example, if i spill some coffee on my pants in the morning ill be in a terrible mood of extreme anger for at least 2 hours. This anger feels way deeper than simple frustration, and I tend to let it take over my entire thoughts and energy.  It causes me to lash out on people for no reason, and I tend to start random unnecessary arguments with my friends. Other times something small will cause extreme anger, but then a few minutes later im really happy or content. When i have outbursts, I tend to yell or say things I do not mean. 

I have horrible attachment issues. When I meet a potential romantic partner im interested in, i find myself immediately thinking about our future or a possible relationship when i first meet them. I get attached to people i barely know.  Once they show they aren’t as attached as me, or I feel abandoned or ignored, i become extremely depressed for days. Small comments even do this. For example my ex the other day told me that he enjoys looking at bell bottom jeans on other girls. I know this is so minimal of a comment especially from an ex I havent been with in 6 months, but it made me feel gut wrenchingly horrible, and I immediately began thinking about everything I hate about myself. Im still depressed about this, and this was 3 days ago.

Im diagnosed with depression, OCD, and Anxiety, but I go through depressive episodes. Afterwords  I go through periods where I feel extremely confident, ambitious, and productive. I am happy with myself and insecurities, and I don’t feel the need for outside validation. 

I just find myself frequently going through extreme mood swings and its hard to feel stable. I have a day where im on a high and I feel incredible, then the next day I feel extremely depressed, lonely, and worthless. 

Again i am in no way self diagnosing, but i would love a perspective from someone who has BPD. If anyone has any questions for me please feel free to reach out. Thank you!",1,1770447357.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

1qy6xbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1qy6xbj/how_to_reduce_sharp_unpleasant_bitterness_in/,"How to reduce sharp, unpleasant bitterness in coffee — from a roasting perspective","A lot of people describe bitterness in coffee as one thing, but in roasting I’ve found there’s a big difference between:

* **structured, cocoa-like bitterness** (acceptable, sometimes desirable)
* **sharp, edgy, “stinging” bitterness** (the kind that ruins drinkability)

From a roasting point of view, the *sharp* bitterness usually doesn’t come from “too dark” alone. It’s often a **heat application problem**.

Here are the roasting adjustments that helped me most:

**1. Avoid aggressive early heat that forces the bean**  
Too much energy before or right at yellowing tends to create surface development faster than internal development.  
Result: harsh bitterness even at medium roasts.

→ I now aim for a *controlled, progressive* RoR into yellow, not a rush.

**2. Don’t crash the RoR before first crack**  
A steep RoR drop before first crack often leads to baked flavors *plus* sharp bitterness.  
The bean never fully builds sweetness, so bitterness has nothing to balance against.

→ Keep RoR declining smoothly, not falling off a cliff.

**3. First crack is not the time to panic**  
Over-cutting heat at first crack is one of the fastest ways to create thin body + sharp bitterness.  
You want *less heat*, not *no heat*.

→ Gentle reduction, stable development, no flick, no stall.

**4. Development time matters more than development %**  
A “correct” DTR on paper can still taste sharp if development is rushed at high energy.

→ Slightly longer, calmer development often softens bitterness dramatically without going darker.

**5. Solubility > color**  
Two roasts with the same Agtron can taste wildly different.  
Sharp bitterness often means uneven solubility, not over-roasting.

For me, when bitterness tastes *pointy* instead of *round*, it’s usually a sign the roast lacked internal balance, not that it went too far.

Curious how others here diagnose sharp bitterness — do you see it more as a roast defect, or something you fix later in grinding and extraction?",1,1770447211.0,coffee_roasters,3,1.0,False

This is inevitable for most men with age and this is what most of religious ""mythology"" is actually about, including the famous crucifixion story.

While you hear about prostate issues here and there nobody talks about the men genital inflammation and super-painful consequences. It's intentional. The more impotence, the better. Coffee, spices, alcohol, sugar, greasy/fried food, lack of vitamins, sedentary job - all contribute to this scenario.

If you missed the inflammation and didn't take ibuprofen on time and neuropathy did happen, - you are in pain for months, at least. The good news is that it passes (aka ""Jesus resurrected"").

To stop inflammation and manage pain:  
\+ ibuprofen  
\+ anti-inflammatory creme

To make it go away faster:  
\+ walk or leg exercise (blood circulation)  
\+ sun (or vitamin D)  
\+ gentle heat of painful areas (I used tiny plastic hand warmers)

I grew up with stomach issues (chronic constipation ages 4-12) and now have issues with digesting certain foods after a few years of being normal. I'm now going to a gastroenterologist and we're trying to figure out what's wrong. I haven't been able to go to the bathroom for around 5 days now. I've had excess gas, but nothing else. Now I've been in the bathroom for 11 hours straight, with fecal impaction, and the pain when trying to go is unbearable. It's gotten to the point where my body is refusing to let me try and push again, because it hurts so bad, I'll start crying. This is your I imagine birth feels. I know this is probably a trauma response because of all those years having these problems, and being scared to use the bathroom half my life because of the pain, but I really am trying and I just can't. I can't get up because I have leakage, so I'm just stuck here. I've tried miralax in coffee, I've tried a bullet suppositorie, I even tried the manual option with the gloves, nothing is working. I half want to just go to the ER and beg them to put me to sleep and fix me so I won't have to feel the pain. My mom says that they won't put my to sleep and will just use the liquid suppositorie like they did when I was a kid, which was traumatic for me. I didn't know what to do, that feels like my only option, but I didn't think they would do that because it's not severe I don't think. How stupid would I look if I asked? I don't want the pain and I'm trying not to cry again because it's so damn frustrating. Can ERs even do that? Put you to sleep to fix it while your out even if its not severe? My parents will probably be mad if I ask and look at me like I'm stupid again, but I have to know. I'm so tired dude, I don't know what to do. Like, when it's not trying to tear me open, I can't even really feel it, so it can't be that severe, but I'm also having leakage to idk. Will I look stupid to the doctors at the ER if I ask?

Chapter 1 

Five years ago, my husband begged me to let his childhood sweetheart keep their bastard kid. 

Sure. 

Deal was simple-she disappeared forever, I got half the Blackwood empire. 

Everyone called me a gold-digger. 

Ezra burned bridges with his entire family just to protect that kid. 

Five years later-random business trip, I found a lost boy. 

The cop dialed his emergency contact. 

A voice I knew way too damn well picked up. 

“Don’t worry, buddy. Daddy’s coming right now.” 

Thirty minutes later, Ezra-who was supposed to be a thousand miles away-came SPRINTING through the doors. 

We locked eyes. 

He froze. 

I smiled. 

“Ezra Blackwood, I had NO idea you had a second secret kid.” 

“Kiss the other half goodby roo.” 

“Scarlett, let me explain-” 

Ezra shielded the kid behind him. That instinct stabbed right through me. 

I cut him off, grabbed my bag. 

“Have that bitch come get the kid. We need to talk.” 

“Ivy’s not well-” 

“Ezra.” I stared him down, ice-cold. 

“You want me to call your grandpa right now, or should I just have my lawyer send the papers?” 

He shut up. 

That contract I had could kick him out of his CEO chair, leaving him with nothing. 

The kid-Asher-suddenly stuck his head out and yelled at me. 

“Bad lady! Don’t bully my dad!” 

Innocent words from a child, yet somehow the most cutting. 

Ezra panicked, slapped a hand over the kid’s mouth, eyes wide with fear. 

“Nice job raising him.” I let out a bitter laugh. 

“Guess Ivy didn’t learn much over the years. Except gotten very good at sowing discord.” 

I turned and walked out of the station. 

Outside, snow was coming down hard. Freezing cold. 

I remembered five years ago. Ivy showed up at my door, pregnant as hell. 

Ezra got on his knees in front of me, eyes bloodshot, begging me to let the baby live. 

I had just miscarried and was at my weakest. 

I signed, but imposed two conditions: 

First-Ivy and the kid leave ” New York. Never come back. 

Second-Ezra’s 50% stake in Blackwood Group? Mine. 

Grandpa Sterling almost beat him to death with his cane over it. 

But to calm my anger, he let it happen. 

Ezra swore to me then: “Scarlett, I screwed up. I was an idiot. You’re the only one I love.” 

“Take the money. Take my life-just let her have the baby. I’ll spend the rest of my days making it up to you.” 

And for five years, he actually did play servant. 

Chapter 1 

No matter how busy he was, he called every single day. 

Never missed a holiday. Never skipped a gift. 

He even ditched a hundred-million-dollar deal just to spend the weekend with me. 

I really thought time could heal everything. 

The snow stopped. 

Ezra had the driver take the kid home first. 

But he didn’t dare leave. Didn’t dare let me leave either. 

We sat in the coffee shop next to the station. 

“Scarlett, it’s not what you think.” 

Ezra pressed his hands to his forehead, voice low. 

“Ivy… she really did leave New York.” 

“But she couldn’t survive out there. Asher’s got asthma and a heart condition.” 

“Medical bills abroad are insane. She couldn’t handle it alone.” 

“So you just brought them back?” I stirred my coffee. 

“Bringing him back wouldn’t be so bad, but you placed him in Blackwood’s luxury apartments. Go see them once a 

week.” 

“Ezra, you running a charity or keeping a mistress?” 

“I’m just visiting the kid!” Ezra shot back, desperate. 

“Scarlett, the kid’s innocent.” 

“Asher’s sick. Every time he has an episode, he cries for his dad. What was I supposed to do?” 

“I couldn’t just let him die.” 

“But you could let me sit here like an idiot, completely in the dark?” I fired back.

Hey everyone,

After about a full year of near-daily training with **3 sets** of push / pull / legs, I started wondering if there would be any meaningful difference if I dropped down to **2 sets instead of 3**.

With 3 sets, my sessions usually took **9 to 12 minutes**. And on some days — because of temporary fatigue or a small discomfort — I would naturally reduce the session to **2 sets**.

And I was always perfectly happy with those shorter sessions.

So at some point, I decided to commit to it: I gave myself **3 months**, and trained with **only 2 sets every day**.

Here’s what I was doing:

* **Pull**: pull-ups (around 10–14 reps)
* **Push**: push-ups (around 16–20 reps)
* **Legs**: bodyweight squats (30 reps)

I also took this opportunity to simplify things even more, sticking to very basic, fundamental movements.

And you know what? **I didn’t notice any difference.**

I never felt like I was training less. My physique still felt “activated” and maintained by those sessions. 

And the biggest consistency lever of all: **my sessions now only took about 6 minutes.**

Honestly… how can you *not* train when it takes that little time? It’s literally less time than scrolling through a short Instagram session.

\------

I enjoyed this simplification so much that I ended up fully adopting it. This is now how I train every morning.

I make a coffee, spend about half an hour at my desk to start my day (I work from home as a freelancer), and then I do my session.

I always come out of it feeling energized. Keeping bodyweight squats — and doing them at a fairly quick pace — creates just enough cardio stimulation to give me a really noticeable energy boost.

I genuinely recommend trying this. Really.

Bright, alive, endless.  
Golden skies melting into evenings of laughter,  
Warm breezes wrapping around my skin like comfort.  


Winters?  
Too cold , too distant.  
I never understood how anyone could love,  
A season that froze even the heart.  


Then you came,  
With hands that felt like morning sunlight,  
And eyes that carried the calm of falling snow.  
You spoke of winters as if they were poetry.  
And slowly, I began to listen.  


Sitting by your side,  
Steam rising from our coffee mugs,  
Music soft as your voice,  
I thought ,  
Maybe winters weren’t cruel after all.  


When you made me wake up at six,  
Just to watch the sunrise,  
I realized it wasn’t the sun I wanted to see.  
It was you.  
And maybe warmth is only real,  
When shared in the cold.  


But you left,  
Before the snow could melt.  
Now the summers feel too loud, too bright,  
Too full of things I’ve lost.  


Someone asks me my favourite season.  
I still say summer.  
But my heart,  
It whispers winter.

That’s why whenever someone asks a meet up over coffee, I assume they expect flirting will turn something they expected and I always tell them I am boring because men just want the fun right away, which is straight up boring for me and no substance.

Some days it's 4:30 if I actually get to bed early lol.

The first week was pure willpower. I had a solid reason for doing this (growing the business + staying healthy), and I just kept reminding myself of it. Even on nights I slept at 1AM, I'd still drag myself up at 5.

I stopped napping during the day too – it made falling asleep earlier way easier. After 1 week, my body adjusted and I was naturally getting 7–8 hours and waking up around 5.

Still, some mornings I feel like garbage even after solid sleep. It happens. Here's what's helped me push through:

Things that made it easier:

**Morning stuff:**

* Short workout right after waking (even 10 mins). Gets blood flowing.
* Morning sunlight – learned this from sleep research. It actually sets your biological clock and helps with cortisol/energy throughout the day.
* Coffee at 10-11AM instead of right away (hits way better for me)

**Evening wind-down:**

* No caffeine after 2PM (8 hours before bedtime)
* Don't go out late at least on weekdays – I try to wrap up social stuff by 8PM
* Phone away 30 mins before bed – spend time with family, wind down properly
* Quick 20-25 min nap if I'm truly exhausted (but only if needed)

**Work strategy:**

* Do the hardest/most boring work first, save easy stuff for when I'm tired later

Accountability was huge. I joined an online group for early risers & productivity. When you know other people are doing it too, it's easier to not hit snooze.

And yeah, some days I just don't do it. I sleep in. That's fine. The key is not letting one lazy morning turn into a lazy week.

Nothing magical here, just consistency and being a bit stubborn about it.

**Quick note:** After months of trial and error, plus diving into sleep science (podcasts, research papers, learning from experts), I put together a checklist/protocol that covers everything that's worked for me – sleep hygiene, morning routine, what to avoid, etc.

I still follow it today. If you want it, just drop a comment and I'll send it over. Always happy to help if you're working on fixing your mornings.

6. **Barot Valley (Mandi)** Riverside calm, trout farms, pine forests—perfect for slow mornings and quiet evenings.

Big read sorry, Turned into a vent towards the end.



AITAH

  
I'm 38 & wife is 34,

2 kids 13 & 6 y/o both boys

We both work 

  
I work between 6 am & 4:30 pm managing a company that supports people with disabilities  
  
Wife works different shifts, 12pm - 9:30 pm or 5pm until 10:30 pm. Depending on the roster her workdays are usually x2 12 pm - 9:30 pm shifts & x2 5pm until 10:30 pm shifts with 3 days off. 

Morning routine i will wake both the 13 & 6y/o up.  
get breakfast ready, make sure 13 y/o shower ect  
sometimes the 6y/o will try to sleep in or just lay in bed  
I will either make the 13 y/o lunch or have him make it ( i prefer he make it but if we wake up late, I will make it )

Put 1 load of random washing on

Between this I'm checking my work emails for short notice shift cancellations & trying to roster staff asap for shifts. 

13y/o will get ready and leave the house around 8am

I'll clean up the table and put dishes into the sink to be stacked into the dishwasher later.

Wife will wake up at 8 am & when she is up I leave and head to the office for the day.

She will finish getting the 6y/o ready for school and drop him off. Usually around 9 am he will get to school. This gripes me because school starts at 8:30. But it does not leave me resenting her. 

She will then return home and either go back to sleep, doom scroll social media or watch tv shows.  She will almost always go home after school drop off for the 6 y/o 

We all use an app called life360, On this app it lets us all see each other location, time at that location ect. This was initially used for us to help monitor our sons location as this year he wants his independence & without him having to report in every 10 minutes we can see where he is if needed. 

When viewing my wife's map location, 80% of the time she will return home & stay home until 11:45 am or 4:45pm when her shift is meant to start

If my wife has a 5pm shift she will pick the 6y/o up at 3pm and return home. 

I will leave work at 4:30 pm & pick the 6y/o up from afterschool supports on days my wife starts at 12pm. & for 5pm shifts I'll will meet her at work & pick the 6y/o up from there. 

13y/o will get the bus back home.

* When I get home this is mostly the routine   
* 13 & 6y/o empty their lunch box's
*  13 y/o put mobile phone on charge
*  have free time & play with the dog Vacuum while the boys are outside or pick toys & junk off from the floor
*  empty the dish washer Stack the dish washer with things that were used in the morning 
* Take out rubbish that the wife had overloaded while at work, Most times overflowing and general rubbish just sitting on the floor
* Clean dining table bench that wife has made dirty, leaving breadcrumbs all over it, butter & spreads left out, Knife left on bench. Coke can left on bench. takeaway wrappers I.E MacDonalds bags and empty drink cup, half eaten food on a plate or in a bowl ( 2 bins are directly under the Bench, 1 for general and 1 for recycling)
* Finish stacking the dish washer and turn it on
*  Re wash clothes not hung out from the morning (this consistently happens)
*  Watch some TV or YouTube 
* Read with 6y/o 
* Check if 13 y/o has homework
* Cook dinner 
* 13 y/o feeds both Dog & Cat before dinner 
* Kids have a shower after dinner Brush teeth Dirty clothes put in the washing machine Put 6y/o to bed usually around 8pm 
* 13 y/o has free time and will go to bed at 10:30 pm 
* hang out first load of washing & put another load on
* Clean mess from dinner
* Finish tidying the house now that the 6y/o wont mess it up again ( not a huge clean at all but fix couch cushions, Pick up towel from his shower, pack some toys away)
*  If needed sweep and mop the floor
* Dump first dry load of washing into the '' Doom'' Pile 

  
That's an overall summary of our Monday to Thursday.

Friday and Saturday the boys do what the like and just do important jobs

* Feed the animals 
* shower 
* help with toy pickup 
* Tidy the table for dinner

Saturday or Sunday i always check the 6y/o nails and cut them if needed  
I'll also book a barber if needed the following weekend if needed.

This routine might sound like a lot, but over the last 3 years i have tried so so many different things with the two boys and my wife. None worked except for pretty much me doing it. 

I do suspect that my wife had suffered with postnatal depression from our 6 y/o  
I supported her as much as i could physically & mentally could without destroying myself. 

When the 6y/o came home from hospital, I did all of the evening feeding with either formular or pre expressed milk. I did this with the 30 minute cluster feeding while my wife was snoring away & i did not wake her. I wanted her to rest as much as possible.

I would have no sleep for 24 hours and the worst was 36 hours. just so my wife could have a good sleep in the evening after watching a newborn and our other son.  My work was very accommodating and even allowed me to nap for an hour or two in the morning.   


I did the entire evening routine until he was 1 y/o and i mentally & physically couldn't do it anymore. 

  
From then onwards my wife really started to help out less and less. we spoke about it, Things would improve but eventually revert to me doing the cooking, cleaning, feeding, nappy changes, showering doctors' appointments & school drop off for out first son too.

Much like now, I would get how and i never expect a sparking clean house and everything tidy. Kids are mess and its always going to be '' Kid messy'' but i would retune home from work to like now, Food still on the table from breakfast, washing not down, rubbish piling up, floor sticky from seeming being spilled.

We spoke about this a few more times and my wife went to the Doctor for medication to help her mental health. 

This was in good intention to help the situation; however nothing improved over time.

I tried gifts, spa days with her best friend, holiday away with just us two. noting that i done helped improved this. 

During this time around 2 years into our 2nd baby, Financially we hit a wall. My wife's paid leave had ran out & she did not want to get another job in the ages care industry, I supported this decision and asked if she had looked into upskilling into nursing or something else. 

My wife procrastinated for another year while staying at home with no income. This is when firs started to be resentful and felt more of a financial cow / personal assistant than a father & husband.

I discussed this again and advised my wife of how damaging it is becoming financially and draining on my to continue doing all of the duties i do. 

I was never met with understanding but made to feel bad that I'm saying she is a bad mother and does almost nothing. 

  
I would pull back and stop doing things for months to see if my wife would pick up the slack for me.

* Not do washing 
* Not do dishes 
* Not check sons nails ( though i was checking) 
* Not booking medical appointments 
* Not cooking

Nothing improved when i pulled back. I spoke to her about it and again i was met with \* do you think i do nothing all day ?  ect \*

* I explained to my wife some of the below points
* that our new baby was now almost 4 years old and is going to day care.
* I picked up a 2nd morning job 6 am until 1pm ( I was previously working 2:30pm until 10:30 pm before my new current job )
* We are now living on gift cards and after pay because she wont work.

After doing this on and off for such a long time it had became obvious that it was not improving, She was not picking up the slack & the kids were suffering hygienically wise if i would not step in. 

I let her know that in 6 months if things arrent better ill be taking the boys and moving out. 

6 months come by and nothing is better, Infect she did not apply for one job during that time. 

I reached out to her father ( absolutely lovely man) and asked if we could stay there until i found a new rental.

He opened up and advized i could live there as long as me and the boys wanted, He has seen me do so so much for the kids and no help from my wife.  I was taken back by this as my impression was that being his child he would defend his daughter. 

We got a rental the two boys and i & the boys grandfather is around almost every 2nd day having a coffee and catch up. 

My wife would stay some nights and things really improved and it seemed that she had the wakeup call she needed. 

  
She moved it and initially things were well & fast forward until now, Its all back to how it previously was. 

However she now had a job

Credit where it is Due, She will now assist with booking doctors appointments for the two boys and organize their medications. 

However once again things are back to how they were before.   
I honestly do love her with everything i have but i can feel my resentment and frustration building up again. 

Additionally for more complexity and or me just jumping to conclusions it appears that she is either having inappropriate chats on her phone or cheating

In my line of work, We observe and work with people who have disabilities both verbal & non verbal. Because of this we are consistently reading and monitoring minor changes in behavior, body language, reactions & patterns to communicate & assist those people with disabilities effectively. 

I have no proof, However change in body language when i ask to use her phone,  No longer shares location on that life360 app & given the amount of free time she has before work is a horrible concoction of assumptions and snatiation that run through my head.  I hate snooping, however when i had gone to check her phone last night she was asleep laying on it, She is sleep protecting it now. On her apple watch it that i actually managed to chec, It seemed that so so much information had been deleted. The message section has 4 perople in total that had messaged her. Although i know she receives multiple of messages to her phone and watch while at work. 

I'm unsure if im actually worried something is happening or if im looking for something that will give me the ability to say \* so long don't come back\* 

AITAH for wanting to kick her out / look for evidence of emotional cheating or physical cheating ?

I know my bible and study (almost) daily. But there is one concept i have nore trouble with the more i try to learn about it. I dont understand the concept of ""living in sin"" i know people say its habitual unrepentant sin. But if watching too much TV is idolotry, if thinking sexually immoral thoughts falls under several sinful categories. Eating too much? Overweight? Even a little? Thats gluttony. Hoarding? Also gluttony. Need coffee to function properly? Now you have an addiction, that also falls under practicing witchcraft.(greek word being pharmakeia i believe). Got anger issues? Well, youve got another problem. Taking a few extra minutes on your break? Well now you're stealing time from your employer. Etc, Etc, Etc. 

To summarize when i read scripture such as Galatians 5:19. I see it reflected in the habits of even the most devout Christians i know. The only thing i can conclude is that the sins listed in this verse, and ""living in sin"" are being addressed in their most extreme forms. Such as premarital sex and extreme obesity. Drunkenness to the point of a life being totally bombed out all day. Anger, envy, reviling, all to the point of causing damage to relationships. 

I say all this because i am troubled by many things i see in my own life. Take meds to sleep, drink energy drinks to wake up. Trouble focusing or staying motivated at work. (Slothfulness). I try not to look at porn, yet regardless of abstinence, the lustful desires and fantasies always linger. Im easily frustrated and overwhelmed particularly with my coworkers. I could go on and on about all the little sinful habits i see in my own life and though i know the answer is complete surrender to Christ, but after years of struggling and agonizing and ""same ol, same ol"" im really just confused, lost and frustrated.
