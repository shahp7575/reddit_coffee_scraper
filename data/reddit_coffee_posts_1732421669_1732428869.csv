This involved taking her phone from my hands and deleting their texts after he sent a suspicious message. 

We had a long string of arguments which she used as a reason for wanting to hide the interactions from me, so I wouldn‚Äôt get upset. I was never distrustful, but after months of being distrustful of her, I got therapy and learned a much better way of communicating to prevent arguments and trusted her fully.

About 5 months after the initial EA, I had a gut feeling after a guy called her asking her to hang out. Turns out they‚Äôd been calling each other 3-5x a day and she deleted the calls and texts, and initially lied and said she didn‚Äôt delete them. She also admitted to seeing him a few days prior for coffee, her card transactions back this up. Same thing afterwards, she begged me to not leave her and promised to never lie again. 

A few months went by and I wasn‚Äôt able to accept this. She said she stopped communicating with this guy but I took her phone and messaged him, from her account, to see what his responses were and see how often they‚Äôd seen each other. His replies checked out and seemed innocent, aside from earlier conversation where she changed her name in their DMs and he responded ‚ÄúCUTIEE üíï‚Äù to the name change. To which she said yeah he probably has feelings for me. 

Here‚Äôs the problem: she said this was a longtime friend who was there for her in tough times. I was suspicious of their interactions and told her to call him and record the call of her saying they can‚Äôt be friends because of his inappropriate texts to her. She dragged her feet on it but finally agreed. 

It was a 1 minute call, she recorded the first 45 seconds (her saying they can‚Äôt talk anymore) and the recording ended, and she said that was it. I noticed the time discrepancy in her call log and I could see her trying to come up with a lie for where the rest of the conversation is, but she admitted ‚Äúshe started crying and thanked him for all he did for her‚Äù and didn‚Äôt want to me to think bad about her reaction. 

Am I overreacting? Should I accept what she‚Äôs given? ",1,1732428453.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,2,1.0,False

1gyk93s,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1gyk93s/29f_and_38m_we_broke_up_because_of_distance_and/,(29F and 38M) We broke up because of distance and now live in the same city...,"So this guy and I had been seeing each other LD for about 2 years. During that time we'd broken up and gotten back together more than a dew times, and each time agreed to stay friends but would find ourselves taking it further than friendship anytime we met up. It sucked because each time, he would start pulling away and when I'd ask him about it, he would admit the distance was getting to him and would remind him how far apart we were and it made him shut down.

We did talk about moving closer to each other btw, this wasn't a ""no plans to move"" situation, but it would be at least another year for either of us, and nothing was set in stone yet because of our jobs. However, he finally admitted that it was too hard to see each other so little and the last conversation we had we agreed to stop seeing each other completely and went no contact. It was really disappointing and hurtful but I eventually got past it.

Well, just a few weeks ago, I finally ended up making that move. I started at a new job and new city and was checking out one of the coffee shops yesterday in this new place, when lo and behold, of all people I would see, I saw him. I was in a rush to meet with a friend, and so didn't get to talk for very long, but after the initial shock, found out that he'd moved here a little over a month ago. He asked of course if we could catch up and talk, and I've texted him a couple of times, and he has brought up trying a relationship again, but I'm having reservations right now.

It's just that during our LDR. I always felt like I was putting in the work, and he would start pulling away and then we'd break it off, become friends, and the next time we talked it would become flirty and there we went back into the cycle. I just felt like we'd start off strong, but then he would stop putting in effort while I kept trying, and then he would chalk it up to the distance. I know the distance sucked. Every one on this sub can attest to that. But effort from both sides is important, I believe.

And that's what I'm worried about. Was it really the distance? Or him just not trying enough? I'm at war with myself here, because I can see why I fell for him in the first place and would like to see where it takes us, but another part of me keeps reminding myself about all the push-pulling he would do and wonder if I'd only be opening myself up to heartbreak once again. Has anyone been through something similar? Or just any advice at all lol?",2,1732428221.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False
1gyk8uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gyk8uk/something_strange_is_happening_at_oilsbrooke/,Something strange is happening at Oilsbrooke Mental Research Facility. ,"[Part 1]

Doctor Branthor would kill me if he found out I was typing this publicly, but if something happens to me, people need to know that something strange is going on in these woods.

Plus I doubt anyone important at my job surfs online forums, so I should have awhile before I am discovered.



My employer never took the hiring process too seriously. Hence why a paranoid schizophrenic is working as a surgeon in an over glorified asylum, owned privately by Mister Edgar Oilsbrooke. 

Oilsbrooke Mental Research Facility, to me, is paradise on Earth. 

My condition often puts my patients on edge. Something about my eyes does not instill hope in them. Not much gets to me any more, though.

Three days ago, I finally met a patient that made me feel how all those I put under the scalpel must have felt.

I quite like the catatonic ones, the psychos are always exciting, and those with no condition whatsoever are my favorite. You'll often hear me humming down the concrete and metal hallways of the facility,the notes falling flat, dully vibrating in some of the patient's cells.

That day, though... What I saw truly disturbed me.

I entered the front lobby after my hour long walk up the forested mountainside road. It leads a few miles up and out of the small town that is tucked within a valley with several claw-like peaks that tear imposingly into the clouds and the very heavens themselves.

I can't tell you the name of the town, but let's just call it Lichwood. 

Lichwood is tucked far out of civilization's prying eyes. It's a place where the devil often treads, shifting silently down the roads and through the trees. 

Weird things happened here quite often. And that day, when I went to visit my favorite patient, I was horrified at what I found.

My favorite patient, Tim Burgeons, was due for his monthly inhibitor replacement. Simply put, once a month I slice open Tim's head and skull to change out Doctor Branthor's treatment.

Tim has a severe case of hysteria and suffers crippling insomnia, often screaming through the night. I usually enjoy the uncompromising screams of despair as I make my way to his room.

Three days ago, it was different. 

I walked down the long, cold corridors lined with unpainted and cracked concrete. The smell of alcohol and cleaning chemicals in the air have stained every surgeon gown that I own, and it only somewhat masks the stench of blood.

When I walked into Tim's room, I knew something was off. He was sleeping in his somewhat ragged bed, and soundly. 

Alarmed, I went over to wake him up. He was sleeping face down, snoring softly and looking at peace. 

When I got close enough to touch his body, I recoiled. On the base of the back of his neck sat a pus filled abscess, as round as a quarter, filled with a greyish yellow substance that glowed with a bioluminescent light.

Occasionally it twitched, and when it did it jiggled like a rancid pudding cup that threatened to burst in the summer heat with a single touch.

It cast a strange illumination across the small hairs on the back of his neck. It pulsed just a bit, and a tingling sensation began to flood my mind. Like every neuron was being scrubbed by a horse brush. I wanted to knock it out of my head.

I knew if I reported this to Doctor Branthor, he wouldn't let me do any slicing. So like the good natured surgeon that I am, I donned my scalpel and my protective gear and got ready to operate.

I slowly inched my blade towards the slowly shaking, volatile pus sack that glowed dimly in the padded cell lit only by the abscess and the hallway light. Tim and his bed were the only things locked in this dark grey padded cell.

Just as my blade cut flesh, the overwhelming smell of rotted and wet mold penetrated my senses. I started to fall backwards, but Tim's hand shot up and gripped my hand, closing quick like a bear trap.

It didn't hurt. It mostly startled me. But his grip was like iron, I couldn't pull free. 

The light in the abscess glowed a bit stronger now. My mind felt shakey... well, shakier than usual. Tim laid motionless, and yet I saw a ghostly visage of him contort oddly out of him and look at me with an otherworldly and yet warming look of caring, like a demon that wanted desperately to protect me.

It twisted it's spine with a strange, almost old camera filtered energy crackling about it. It somewhat twitched as it's body pulled itself and spun to look me in the eye.

Tim's voice, although usually filled with terror and despair, slowly reverberated calmly through every cell in my brain. 

It was like I could feel bursts of pressurized energy that pulsed through my skull, like some strange new presence shared it's confines with the other voices.

He said, plainly and bluntly, ""Please don't take my Light away, Doctor Luxbury. I don't want to go back to the dark.""

His ethereal body twisted unnaturally and tried to pry itself from the physical Time lying on his bed. I was staring into the lava-like yellow eyes of this strange spirit. I almost felt bad for it.

It looked warmly into my soul tried to plea to me.

""If you take my Light, I will go back to blubbering insanity. Please, Doctor Luxbury, let me go."" 

His voice was soulful, full of life and newfound love for a world he never really saw in this celestial perspective before.

He let go of my hand, gently. I gave him a smile and looked him in his pulsing energy-like eyes and held the blade up to my lips.

I told him, ""I'm going to take your light from you, Tim. I won't let the demons have you. Only science can fix that messed up brain of yours."" 

I remember feeling so scared despite my words, watching Tim look up at me with a twinge of sadness and disappointment. Everything was slightly swirling in the back of my skull and my mouth dried as I tried to keep my composure.

Then, sighing slowly, he smiled and closed his eyes. 

The pulsing in my brain trailed along my spine and the walls of my skull like a wave on the ocean as his calm and polite voice rang out.

""So be it, Doctor. Eventually, you too will see the Nectar's Light. We won't force you to, but you will see things with clarity, in due time."" 

Despite it's nonchalant demeanor, the weight of his threat was not lost on me.

Tim's crackling and ghostly form pressed back into his facedown body. With gloved fingers, I used my scalpel to slice the flesh around this abscess, deciding to try not to rupture it.

As I finished my cut and used a pair of forceps to slowly peel his fresh flesh from the back of his neck, the vile boil popped with a pressurized squelching noise. I watched the glowing yellow liquid breach the volatile flesh, spreading down the neck and back like an oozing pimple before I could use a rag and alcohol solution to disinfect it.

After disposing of the biological hazard, Tim became his old self again and started screaming madly into the padded walls that surround us. It was the first sweet symphony of many that day.

However, the conversation we had lingered in my mind for the rest of that day... And the next day, things were only going to get worse.



I decided that, despite the fact he was undoubtedly going to be furious with my actions, Doctor Branthor had to learn of my discovery.

I approached the old, gristled man early enough in the day that his black coffee was still steaming in the styrofoam cup that he clutched in his withered hand. 

""Doctor Branthor, yesterday I witnessed a peculiar lesion on my patient, and what I found may intrigue you..."" 

I described the previous day's event and watched as his eyebrows furrowed heavily.

In his lively baritone voice, he asked me quite straightforwardly, ""Were you just having another episode, Luxbury?"" He half joked, half seriously questioned me.

""Sir, I know my demons well. This one was different. I think we may need a priest to expel the ghastly being once and for all. The sigils we drew aren't working.""

Doctor Branthor only further shifted his eyes downward as he pondered deeply on my words. His breathing quickened and his eyes kept darting to the little red phone on his desk. 

On it was engraved ""Oilsbrooke."" It was one of those old rotary phones. Completely obsolete, which always confused me, as Branthor is a man of science and logic.

Yet he sat before me at his desk, muttering to himself that ""Mister Oilsbrooke will be most displeased. Very displeased."" He wrung his hands in fear and frustration, beads of sweat dripping down his wrinkled face as he stared down at that phone.

He cleared his throat, dismissing me with a wave of the hand. ""Go, Luxbury. File an official report on this, be very thorough  and add as much specific detail as you can. Then bring it here, and go home.""

My jaw almost hit the floor. In twenty years, I had worked every day of the week, most days with overtime. Oilsbrooke  Facility is my life. But I obeyed, grumbling as I wrote up my report. 

I have never seen Doctor Branthor worried like this in my life. The man was a mentor and acted as a father for me ever since he found me stealing cadavers in the facility graveyard as a young man. 

Certain patients die as Oilsbrooke property and are buried on the grounds for safekeeping, or sometimes, for further brain experiments or surgical practice for new employees.

That night, after resting with a book and having dinner, I found myself walking down the main hall of my home. It's a decent two story place, every American middle class person's dream.
 
The paintings on the wall usually moved about in the dark as I went (if I don't take my medicine.) Tonight, as I walked by, the woman in my lighthouse painting writhed in a mess of dripping oil paint and agony, her face following me down the hall. She always puts a chill down my spine that my other demons don't.

I decided to try and get some sleep around 3 in the morning. As I went to my stairs, I stopped in a daze at the bottom.

Up at the top of the stairs, from outside the window of the upstairs landing, I saw two glowing yellow dots, crackling softly just behind the purple curtains and glass. The light reminded me of Tim the day before. 

Tense energy flowed through my nerves as my blood pumped double time. I reached into my pants pocket, pulling out and preparing my pocket knife to defend myself. 

I have enough demons haunting my every moment, and yet this one gave me the worst feeling of all. I wasn't about to let my fear bring this vile wraith into my life.

In pure animalistic terror and anger, I screamed and ran up the wooden stairway, trying to frighten or kill this demon, or die trying.

I reached the top and without hesitation I stabbed my knife through the curtain and glass, the two orbs staring eerily warmly into my eyes as I did. 

The fabric tore, and glass shattered around my arm. As it did, I felt the bone shattering sensation of my body being torn through the arm sized hole in the window. 

My skull ripped apart against the sharp edges of the window. I felt my eyes trailing behind my annihilated corpse by the fleshy optical nerves.

My body and mind pulsed with that vibrant energy that I loathed so much by now as my body contorted violently, bones crunching as they fought to pass through a physically impossible gap, fighting within my flesh to not damage the glass further. 

I could see Crater mountain far off in the reaches of an empty void. Mister Oilsbrooke stood atop the facility that loomed across the face of the mountain like a wicked omen of death, laughing into the black abyss. 

His head was nothing but a yellow skull that floated independently from it's jaw and the spine, suspended in air. He stood tall over the whole town and kept laughing as the light from the stars above faded into his gaping maw.

My mangled and obliterated body kept falling. Now, a pit glowing with yellow ooze that lines the walls like the blood of a dead god slowly flows deep into the Earth. 

I watch as the doctor's and patients slowly plunge themselves into the depths, their happy and strangely angelic demeanors illuminated by the yellow light one last time as they splashed haphazardly into the pools of ichor below.

The pools grow bigger and bigger as I fall. Then, as I make contact... Everything is light. Warm. Happy. I don't think anymore. The world is gone.



Just when I felt the grasp of unending bliss, I was shaken back to reality as I hit the floor of my bedroom. 

I was sweating like a mad pig, fumbling along the hardwood floor of my bedroom. 

Was it all a dream? It felt so real. Like our realm had been demolished and replaced by some fucked up counterfeit reality that had no natural place in our existence.

The darkened night sky was lit only by a full moon that seemed to stare me down through the single window I had in this room. I tried to slow my breathing. 

I kept expecting the thing to come back, this time peeking into my own sleeping quarters. But he never did.

I decided to stay up that night just to be safe. I looked through some of my collection of demonic wards and sigils and painted a protective glyph at every window and door.


Either it worked, or I really am losing it now. But I didn't sleep again, staying up until the sun awoke from it's own slumber, unaware of the nightmare that shook me to the center of my being.



On the third day, I got up and around early for work. My house groaned and breathed heavily around me as I got ready. 

The grass gave me this strange wavey feeling as it swayed in the breeze. My walk to the facility was the best part of the day.

When I arrived, I was shocked to see an armed guard and a woman wearing a lab coat standing at the gate instead of the normal guardsman. 

The large armed man had a machine gun of some sort and carried a menacing pair of strained eyes and a square jawline riddled with 5 o'clock shadow. 

The woman had a kind and caring look in her eyes, and she looked at her clipboard, flipping down a couple pages.

She smiled and looked at me, her black hair twisted into a tight bun on the back of her head. She was a small woman, but she stood strong. Her name tag read ""M. Shaktia."" 

""Ah,"" she spoke in a soft and shakey tone, ""You must be Doctor Luxbury!"" She shot a gloved hand out and tried to shake mine.

When she saw me just staring at it, she awkwardly withdrew. ""I read your report, Doctor. You did the right thing. Reporting this anomaly may well have saved many lives here in Lichwood. 

She gave me a meek but well received smile and gestured towards a makeshift headquarters set up in an emergency tent out front within the fences of the facility.

""You being the originsl witness to this outbreak, Doctor Branthor wanted you to be briefed firsthand today about what happened since your discovery."" 

At first I was confused, now I was baffled. Briefed? On a pus filled abscess? 

As we approached the huge tent, a man walked out. The doctor quickly fast walked over to the gate guard checkpoint we just came through.

As he did... That feeling of electrical pressure began to scramble the back of my skull as it pulsed from him, almost encompassing everything in my sight.

No one else reacted to it at all. I was alone in the hallucinations, like usual.

Was any of this real? 

I didn't even have time to react before we were pushing through the flap doors of the makeshift triage headquarters. Doctor Branthor was studying the report with a grim look of determination casting shadows on his skin.

As we walked in, his dark demeanor wavered, and he gave me a small nod and waved us over to the corner of the bustling tent. 

""Luxbury, you look like shit. Didn't sleep again?""

I shuddered thinking about the previous night that I had almost successfully blocked out.

Before he could speak, we heard guards yelling at the gate, and a crowd of scientists in hazmat suits ran out and grabbed the doctor I had seen earlier by each arm. 

He didn't fight back or struggle against them. When they walked past the open flap of our tent, I watched the spirit-like visage of his form twist like a crackling tree being ripped from the ground by some giant monster.

It had glowing yellow eyes that pierced my mind with sadness. It's form was fizzling in and out of sight, and as he walked away, it turned and crackled, looking right at me. 

As he was brought into the other tent, the pulse came again, this time it sent my mind wobbling with fear. I wanted to run home and never return. The sounds of a screaming man bounced off of everything in sight and I had to focus on not keeping over and passing out for a moment.

Just as suddenly as the screaming fear gripped my mind and chilled my spine, after a few seconds, it abruptly vanished.


Doctor Branthor sighed, not acknowledging any of what I saw. ""It's been like this since a few hours after you left yesterday. I called Mister Oilsbrooke and updated him on our situation.

After I told him, he got extremely excited and hung up. A couple hours later, miss Marya Shaktia here and her team have taken over our facility.""

He motioned to the woman who greeted me at the gate and continued. 

""The problem is, ever since that call, no one has heard from Mister Oilsbrooke. We plan to continue to research and contain this outbreak, despite it showing no harmful effects to the infected yet.""

When Branthor finished, Doctor Shaktia spoke up, her petite voice riding quietly above the stirring doctor's and the sounds of medical equipment chirping in our ears. 

""Doctor Luxbury, you are to lead our surgical teams in preventing the abscesses from spreading physically to others. The lesions don't seem to be harming anyone yet, but we aren't taking chances."" 

I nodded solemnly. Yes, I was happy about slicing up more patients... But something about the facility shakes me to my core now. 

I occasionally feel the pulses of energy eminating from the facility and from the people around us.

It's like a searing hand is lightly brushing it's way through my head, pulling at a lid on top of my skull every so slightly each time it hits me.

Regardless, I walked right back in and got to work. We didn't have many more outbreaks after that first gentleman was caught, so I hope that perhaps we have things under control. 

And yet, as I looked into the windows on our way to the lobby, I saw it.

Two yellow orbs, shaking slowly behind the curtain. It watched me all the way up the stone path and through the door. Waiting. Watching. 

When I got inside, it had disappeared and I got to work.



I need time to process what I saw in the last three days. I plan to update you on things soon, when I have free time to log it all for you.

No sleep for me tonight. Like Charon on the river Styx, I have souls that need bringing to the lands of the underworld. 

I'll be back soon. Wish me luck. 

Oh, and stay out of Lichwood.

**AITA- Not Supporting GF's Sister**

&#x200B;

Some info: I have been with my GF 27F for 5 years. She loves her sister a ton which is a good thing as I believe supporting and helping your siblings as long as it doesn't ruin your own life (you will understand why I say this later on). We just put down a mortgage on a house in the suburbs of a large city. I 28M work in tech as a software developer with a Masters Degree in Computer Science. I make quite a lot of money so money issues never arose. GF doesn't work and does chores/ cooking in the house (both agreed on this). I was gonna propose to GF next year. But a problem arose about 2 years ago

For the last 2 years (prolly longer) gf has been sending money to her younger sister lets call her Emily. Emily got pregnant at 20 years old. Emily works as a waitress. The father is bouncing from job to job. Emily says that he is very lazy. He will disappear hours at a time without telling Emily where he's going or what he's doing.

Emily has asked my gf on several occasions for money. My gf being the nice and sweet person she is says yes all the time. It started off as paying for diapers, no problem. Then baby clothes which also no problem. Then daycare which I just brushed off. I talked with GF saying we cant always pay for everything and that helping out for a couple things is okay but not everything. GF reassured me and said that it would be stopping soon once they get their feet picked up which is fine.

One day I hire a financial planner. The next day I get an email saying my account has sent approximately $50,000 USD for the last 10 months! and have around $20,000 sitting in my account. I talk with my gf and she apologizes and says she knew that I wouldn't want to keep sending her sister money and how she just cares ab her sister.

WE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR EVERYTHING. Insurance, rent, car payment, day care, clothing for all three, dinners, dates, going out expenses. IT IS partly my fault because I never check my bank account.

GF shows me text messages between her and Emily saying she needs the money. I then noticed a pattern where Emily would say ""Hey can you send me $$$ I don't have money for \_\_\_\_\_\_"" and of course gf says yes. I brush it off and GF says she wont send any more. THE NEXT DAY gf sends her $1000 because they needed car repairs.

I talk with GF and we get into an argument where she says she will always help her sister no matter what. I understand TO AN EXTENT. We argue trying to understand each others POV. As stated before we had $20,000 and now were down to $19,000 and then how about the next time? and the next time after that? on top of our own expenses. GF then decided that she needs some time alone and that she will be at her mothers for the time being. Now I'm all alone in the house I thought I would live with the girl of my dreams.

AITA for arguing with my GF for caring about her sister too much?

*Separate your bank accounts. Do not let her use your money for her sister.That sister is gonna be a leech for your entire life. So yeah, obviously Emily comes packaged with ur gf.*

*Better reconsider your entire relationship because I have a feeling that Emily ain‚Äôt gonna let the golden goose go. I hope the house isn‚Äôt under joint names and that you can finance the mortgage on ur own.*

&#x200B;

**Waltekin**

*Time to look at the big picture: financial planning. Money comes in. Money is used for X, Y and Z. Some fun money. Some savings.*

*Your girlfriend can send as much money as she wants to her sister - as long as it comes from her ""fun money"". She doesn't get to raid your savings. If you cannot trust her, you also don't want to marry her. NTA*

*Just pointing out that $5k / month is a pretty good salary, given she's likely not going to report it as income, and it is on top of whatever her sister earns. Sis is living a good life.*

&#x200B;

**Bricknuts**

*Yes if you want to keep the relationship going, this is a good strategy. I don‚Äôt know how I could ever trust someone that would spend 50k, agree not to do it again without talking to me, then the next day send $1000 behind my back.*

*At this point she and the sister may be splitting the money for when OP and her breakup, as 99.99% of people would never do this if they wanted the relationship to last. Even if that‚Äôs not happening, to go to her moms like that is some sort of power play like she has been wronged, is just so messed up.*

**Update - 1 days later**

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for the support. I never thought that my situation would blow up to thousands of people. I'll try to answer some questions at best. I make around $150,000 a year as a Lead Software Developer. As someone who has no kids, dogs, or any major responsibility besides myself and a GF I never checked my account.

She comes from a cultural family where family is everything and money is just paper. She texted me earlier saying how it should always be family first and that money didn't mean anything without family and how we should help close family like siblings in their time of need. At this point I told her I needed time to myself and told her not to come back until I'm ready to talk. I apologize If my sentences aren't making sense as Whiskey is my only friend rn. I also forgot to mention we started dating before all this money came into play so I trusted her.

another Edit: I'm more sad by the betrayal than the money. Money will come back but time will never come back. 5 whole years, my proposal plan, my life plan, my future kids I dreamt about with her just gone. All the things we've said to eachother. All the late night wine drunk times we spent, all the dates, all the flowers I gave her, I reallyt tried with all my power to be the best man she can have. I would've trusted her with my life and what do i get back? $50,000 gonee.

&#x200B;

**Final Update - 7 days later**

&#x200B;

final update: She is now my ex. We met at a local coffee shop and I told her that things wouldn't workout for us and she went absolutely ballistic. She caused a scene begging me to not end it. It did hurt me to see her like this, but after a couple weeks to give it some thought I would not want a wife who is a liar and one I couldn't trust financially. I left a $100 bill on the table and left but she followed me down to my car.

She begged and told me she wouldn't send anymore money to her sister and how she would do anything for us to be together, it was hard but I stayed strong. She picked up her belongings the other day and I almost had to call the cops because she wouldn't leave. She first tried everything from sexual favors, begging, crying, then it turned to screaming that I ruined her life to even saying without her I wouldn't have gotten to where I am now because of her ""Support"".

I stayed strong and when she left I just broke down sobbing. For those wondering I'm not gonna press charges because all I want is for her to leave me alone. I don't want anything to do with her, I don't ever want to see her face again. The money will come back as It's just me, a house, and 2 paid off cars. It does get lonely so I'm thinking of getting a puppy (A Doberman for those wondering). Thank you everyone for all the suggestions and a lot of you really had me thinking about my decisions and I definitely learned a lot of valuable lessons. Goodbye and thank you!

&#x200B;

**kittyplay86**

*Re-read, she already said she wouldn't before and then sent another 1,000. He can't take her at her word because she lied. She's being very manipulative and offered sexual favors to make him stay, and right now, he knows she's saying all the pretty things she thinks he wants to hear. The moment they settle back into domesticity, she's gonna do the same shit all over again. He HAS to protect his financial future. Breaking up with this gal was the best course of action*

Let's go ahead and start with my mother believing that she was a failed abortion.

Naturally, with this information, my mother believes that my grandmother had also tried to abort her years beforehand.¬†

Growing up, I had to always hear about how there were microphones in the walls listening to us.

Hard to remember when it's been almost 30 years.¬†

There was also that one time she believed she was on Oprah. I think it had to do with one time we were in traffic and there was a news van behind us. My mom realized that the chewing gum that was originally in my mouth was now caught up in my bangs, and her being the perfectionist she is, immediately whipped out her comb and began to try combing the gum out as quickly as possible while my dad fought through traffic.

My Experience with Laughland Teeth Whitening,"If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve probably spent years searching for the best way to whiten your teeth. From drugstore strips to whitening toothpaste and even professional treatments, I‚Äôve tried just about everything. Each method had its ups and downs, but nothing seemed to check all the boxes: effective, easy, and safe for sensitive teeth. That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, and it stood out as something worth trying.

Here‚Äôs my full breakdown of what makes Laughland different and whether it‚Äôs the best treatment for whitening teeth.

# Why Is Whitening So Tricky?

Teeth whitening isn‚Äôt as straightforward as some products make it sound. For one, not all stains are created equal. Some stains‚Äîlike those from coffee, tea, or red wine‚Äîcan be more surface-level, while others, like aging or smoking-related discoloration, go deeper. That‚Äôs why a toothpaste or strip might not cut it. They often work on surface stains only, leaving you frustrated when your teeth still look less than white.

Another challenge is sensitivity. Most whitening products rely on hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which can cause discomfort. For me, that sensitivity often meant I couldn‚Äôt stick with a product long enough to see results.

That‚Äôs why I started looking for something new. I wanted a whitening solution that was effective, safe for my teeth, and simple to use.

# How I Found Laughland Teeth Whitening

I came across **Laughland Teeth Whitening** after seeing a few mentions in Reddit threads. People were talking about how it‚Äôs **dentist-formulated** and uses temperature-controlled storage to keep the whitening gel at full strength. That got my attention because many other products lose potency during storage. I decided to give it a shot since it seemed more advanced than the drugstore kits I‚Äôd tried before.

# What‚Äôs in the Laughland Kit?

The Laughland kit arrived quickly and came with everything I needed:

* **Whitening gel applicators**: Pre-measured for easy use.
* **LED mouthpiece**: Helps activate the gel for faster, more even whitening.
* **Adapters**: So you can plug the device into your phone or USB.
* **Simple instructions**: Easy-to-follow steps that even a first-timer could handle.

What stood out to me right away was the focus on quality. The whitening gel is stored in a temperature-controlled facility, which helps maintain its strength. A lot of over-the-counter products don‚Äôt take this step, so you end up with weaker results.

# How Does Laughland Work?

Using **Laughland teeth whitening** was incredibly simple. Here‚Äôs what the routine looked like:

1. Brush and dry your teeth (this helps the gel stick better).
2. Apply the whitening gel to your teeth using the applicator.
3. Insert the LED mouthpiece, plug it in, and wait for 10 minutes.

That‚Äôs it! It‚Äôs quick and mess-free, which made it easy to add to my daily routine. I‚Äôd usually do it in the evening while watching TV or scrolling through my phone.

# The Results: What I Noticed

I didn‚Äôt expect instant results, but by the third day, I started to see a difference. My teeth looked slightly brighter, and I was curious to see how much they would improve by the end of the week. By day six, the results were undeniable‚Äîmy teeth were at least 5-7 shades whiter.

One of the best parts? I didn‚Äôt experience any sensitivity. This was huge for me because sensitivity is what usually stops me from sticking with whitening treatments. With Laughland, I could feel the gel working without any discomfort.

# Why Laughland Stands Out

After using it for a couple of weeks, I realized why **Laughland teeth whitening** gets so much attention. Here are the key things that make it different from other products I‚Äôve tried:

1. **Dentist-Formulated**: The formula is designed to give professional-level results without the pain or sensitivity that comes with other products. It feels like the kind of whitening treatment you‚Äôd get in a dental office.
2. **Temperature-Controlled Gel**: This is a game-changer. Laughland stores its gel in a temperature-controlled environment to prevent it from losing strength before it gets to you. Most over-the-counter kits don‚Äôt do this, which might explain why they‚Äôre less effective.
3. **LED Mouthpiece**: The LED light isn‚Äôt just a gimmick. It actually helps activate the gel, speeding up the whitening process and making the results more even. It‚Äôs similar to what dentists use in their offices.
4. **No Sensitivity**: This was the dealbreaker for me. Laughland‚Äôs formula is gentle but effective, so you can stick with the treatment without worrying about discomfort.

# Who Is Laughland For?

If you‚Äôre someone who struggles with stained teeth from coffee, tea, or smoking, Laughland is a great option. It‚Äôs also ideal if you‚Äôve tried whitening products before but stopped because of sensitivity issues. The results are natural and long-lasting, and the process is quick and straightforward.

# What Makes Laughland the Best Option?

The more I think about it, the more I‚Äôm convinced that **Laughland teeth whitening** is one of the best at-home whitening treatments available. It‚Äôs not just about getting whiter teeth‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding a product that works without making you suffer through discomfort or complicated steps.

If you‚Äôve been frustrated by strips, toothpaste, or other kits that don‚Äôt deliver, Laughland might be what you‚Äôre looking for. The results speak for themselves, and the process is simple enough for anyone to follow.

# Final Thoughts

In the end, the best treatment to whiten teeth isn‚Äôt about gimmicks or overly complicated processes. It‚Äôs about finding something that works, is easy to use, and doesn‚Äôt cause unnecessary pain. For me, Laughland has been that solution. It‚Äôs effective, safe, and gives results that last longer than any other product I‚Äôve tried.

If you‚Äôre looking for a teeth whitening kit that combines professional-level results with the convenience of home use, I‚Äôd recommend giving **Laughland teeth whitening** a try. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with deep stains or just want a brighter smile, it‚Äôs one of the few products that actually delivers.

- Happy to swap photos if that helps!

**Personality:**
- I‚Äôm pretty shy and anxious around new people, but once I warm up, I‚Äôm talkative and engaging.
- Introvert at heart, but I do enjoy going out with friends.
- I‚Äôm not religious and while I respect all beliefs, it might be tricky to connect with someone who is deeply religious.

**Hobbies:**
- Gaming is a big part of my life‚Äîmostly chill games, whether solo or with friends on Discord.
- Occasionally embarrass myself with a round of golf.
- Metalcore fan here! If you‚Äôre into Polaris / Thornhill / Sleep Token / etc let‚Äôs chat!
- I‚Äôll stay up late to watch Verstappen race or mourn McLaren‚Äôs near-wins.

I‚Äôve tried various dating apps without much luck and would prefer to connect with someone in Australia.

I‚Äôm looking for someone to make daily activities, like grabbing coffee or running errands, more enjoyable as well as enjoying common hobbies.

I would pay probably $20-$35 but these are only $5 at Walmart! I will likely return to stock up on a few on my faves. Surprisingly pleasant and decent for the price range.



Destination Unknown - The Marigold is pretty and the sweetness of the agave is intoxicating 6.8  


Garden Party - I smell Peruvian Lilly right after the alcohol evaporates, followed by other sweet-smelling flowers. It's a delicate scent 6.9  


By the Sea - Bitter and slightly salty smelling! It dies vaguely remind me of open ocean not really by the sea. I really wish this smell was bigger because it's super nice. Delicate citrus smells to round off the dry down is perfection, but I feel like it needs a bigger base note. 6.5  


Wish You Were Here - I'm instantly interested in getting more of this perfume. It smells like drinking coffee and reading newspaper. Like old school news paper from the 90's. Idk something abt this smell is very vintage/nostalgic to me. There's a nice aquatic note like you are surrounded by wet things. Lasts for hours 7.4  


Candle Lit Evening - This feels really classy and nice, but it's again super toned down and I wish it was like 5x in sillage. If this was stronger, they could charge way more mone, takes a while to smell the rose, but you definitely get there eventually. 7.3  


Cabin Retreat - Oh my goodness, this is nice. It makes me feel like I'm in a forest. It also lasts much longer than expected! I would like to add that I enjoy very simple notes. Sometimes I just wear Oak Moss sap and alcohol, or Moss and Cider mixed together. It's a super comforting smell to me. Definitely reminds me the drive to northern Vermont. 7.8

Ok so only ""Cabin Retreat"" and ""Wish You were Here"" have strong silliage. ""Garden Party,"" and ""Candle Lit Evening"" have moderate silliage, while ""By the Sea"" and ""Destination Unknown"" are the most quiet. All the scents are nice in their own ways. I am not blown away, but these perfumes are very nice and unique in their own right. For $5 each this is a total steal.

By the waters of Breaker's Reach, where the salt-laden wind carries whispers of the forgotten...



The old man's weathered hands trembled as he lit the oil lamp, casting dancing shadows across the walls of his study. Outside, the winter wind howled like a beast denied its prey, rattling the shutters of his centuries-old home perched on the edge of Breaker's Reach. Elias Thatcher had lived in this cursed village longer than anyone could remember‚Äîlonger than should have been possible.

""You want to know about the stories?"" he asked, his voice crackling like dried leaves. ""About what really happens here when the winter storms roll in?"" He gestured to the chair across from his desk, its wooden frame groaning beneath the weight of countless visitors who had come seeking answers. ""Very well. But remember‚Äîsome knowledge, once gained, can never be unknown.""



Gerald Matthews stood at his kitchen window, coffee cup frozen halfway to his lips. The sound drifted across the water again‚Äîa deep, resonant toll that shouldn't exist. The Mary Elizabeth and her bell had sunk forty years ago.

But there it was again. Dong. Dong. Dong.

His hands began to shake, coffee spilling onto the windowsill. He knew what it meant. He'd heard it five times before, and each time, someone had died.

The first had been Old Man Peterson, found face-down in his garden with seawater in his lungs‚Äîthree miles from the ocean. Then Sarah Campbell, discovered in her bathtub, her skin cold and wrinkled as if she'd been submerged for days, though her husband swore she'd only been in there for minutes. Three more followed, each death more impossible than the last.

But the worst had been fifteen years ago, when the bell tolled for his daughter, Emily.

She'd been eight years old, playing on the beach despite his warnings about the incoming storm. They found her shoes at the water's edge, perfectly aligned as if she'd stepped right out of them. They never found her body.

Dong.

Gerald's grip tightened on the coffee cup. He'd spent thirty years as keeper of the Breaker's Reach lighthouse before retiring, and he knew every sound the ocean could make. This wasn't natural. This was something else‚Äîsomething that had been waiting.

He grabbed his coat and headed for the door. The bell tolled again, clearer now, calling him toward the harbor. The morning fog had rolled in thick and heavy, turning the world into a gray void. As he walked down the empty streets, the moisture clung to his skin like cold fingers.

Dong. Dong.

Closer now. Through the fog, he could almost make out a shape‚Äîthe ghostly outline of a ship that shouldn't be there. The Mary Elizabeth had been a fishing trawler, lost with all hands in the winter of '83. Gerald had watched it happen from his lighthouse, helpless as the storm drove the vessel onto the rocks.

But there she was, her outline wavering in the mist like a half-remembered dream. And there, hanging from her bow, was the bell.

""Emily?"" Gerald's voice cracked. ""Emily, is that you?""

Something moved on the deck‚Äîa small figure in a yellow raincoat. His heart stopped. Emily had been wearing her yellow raincoat that day.

""Daddy?"" The voice carried across the water, so familiar it physically hurt. ""Daddy, I'm cold. Come get me.""

Gerald stepped onto the dock, his feet moving of their own accord. The wood was slick beneath his shoes, and the fog seemed to part before him, creating a path to the phantom ship.

Dong.

He reached the edge of the dock. The ship loomed before him, its hull black and slick with something that wasn't water. The figure in yellow waved.

""Emily, baby, I'm coming."" Gerald took another step forward, into empty air.

The cold hit him like a physical blow, but he barely noticed. As he sank into the dark water, he saw them‚Äîdozens of faces peering up at him from the depths, their eyes gleaming like distant stars. Some he recognized: Peterson, Campbell, all the others who had answered the bell's call.

And there, floating among them, was Emily‚Äînot as the child she'd been, but as something else, something that had lived in the deep for fifteen years, growing strange and hungry.

She smiled at him, revealing rows of sharp, gleaming teeth.

Welcome home, Daddy.

The bell tolled one final time, and Gerald Matthews became another story for Elias Thatcher to tell.



The ice floe appeared on a Tuesday, grinding against the shore like the bones of some ancient beast. Inside, frozen in perfect suspension, were the lobster traps‚Äîtwelve of them, their metal frames twisted into shapes that made the eyes hurt to look at them too long.

Jacob Winters was the first to find them, and the first to die. But death, as the residents of Breaker's Reach would soon learn, wasn't always the worst fate the sea could offer.

""The ice sang to me,"" Jacob wrote in his journal, three days before they found him. ""It has a voice like broken glass and whale song. When I sleep, I hear it calling names‚Äînames I've never heard before, but somehow know belong to people who were here long before us. Before Breaker's Reach. Before everything.""

The traps came out of the ice one by one, each containing something impossible. The first held human bones, arranged in intricate patterns that defied anatomy. The second contained stones carved with symbols that seemed to shift when viewed directly. The third housed a collection of figurines that, according to local historian Marion Hayes, ""depicted events that hadn't happened yet.""

But it was the fourth trap that broke Jacob's mind.

""It's empty,"" he insisted to anyone who would listen. ""Just an empty trap. But I can hear them inside it‚Äîscratching, whispering, begging to be let out."" He took to carrying the trap with him everywhere, pressing his ear against its rusted frame and muttering responses to voices no one else could hear.

Dr. Sarah Chen, the town's only psychiatrist, tried to help. ""What do these voices say, Jacob?""

""They say the town was built wrong,"" he answered, his eyes never focusing quite right. ""They say we built it on top of something else‚Äîsomething that was here first. Something that's still here, underneath. They say it's hungry.""

A week after finding the traps, Jacob's wife reported him missing. They found his clothes on the beach, laid out in a perfect circle. Inside the circle was the fourth trap, now containing a single figurine‚Äîa perfect miniature of Jacob, his face frozen in an expression of ecstasy and horror.

Marion Hayes took the figurine to the local museum, despite the warnings. ""It's historical evidence,"" she argued. ""We need to preserve it, study it."" But at night, alone in her office, she swore she could hear it scratching against the glass of its display case, trying to get out.

The remaining traps revealed their contents slowly, each one driving its discoverer a little closer to madness. Some claimed the objects inside would move when no one was looking. Others reported dreams where the figurines spoke to them, sharing secrets about the town's true history.

""There's a pattern,"" Marion wrote in her final report before her own disappearance. ""The symbols, the bones, the figurines‚Äîthey're all telling the same story. But it's not just about the past. It's about what's coming. The ice preserved these traps for a reason. They're not just artifacts. They're warnings.""



Nora Sullivan first noticed something was wrong when her son Michael started leaving wet footprints in the hallway at night. Not the kind that came from sneaking to the bathroom or spilling a glass of water‚Äîthese footprints glistened with brine and contained tiny fragments of seaweed.

""He's my friend,"" Michael said when she asked about the mysterious ""Man in the Waves."" ""He shows me things in the water. Beautiful things. Scary things. True things.""

""What kind of things, honey?""

Michael's eyes grew distant, the same way Jacob's had in those final days. ""He shows me the city under the waves. Where everyone goes when the ocean takes them. He says there's a place for me there too.""

That night, Nora woke to the sound of choking. She found Michael in his bed, seawater pouring from his mouth in an impossible stream. His eyes were open but unseeing, and his skin had taken on a greenish, translucent quality.

""He's changing,"" the doctor said helplessly. ""His tissue... it's not quite human anymore.""

Nora began to notice other changes. Michael's fingers developed a slight webbing. His teeth grew sharper. And sometimes, when he thought she wasn't looking, she caught him staring at her with eyes that reflected light like deep-sea creatures.

The Man in the Waves appeared to her one night, standing in Michael's doorway. He wore the tattered uniform of a 19th-century sailor, his flesh pale and bloated, hair writhing like seaweed in an invisible current. Water cascaded endlessly from his clothes, but the floor remained dry.

""He's meant for the deep,"" the figure said, its voice bubbling like a drowning man's last breath. ""They all are. The children of Breaker's Reach belong to what lies below.""

""Why?"" Nora demanded. ""Why our children?""

The figure's smile split its face too wide, revealing row upon row of needle-sharp teeth. ""Because they're not your children. They never were. We just let you borrow them for a while.""

That's when Nora remembered something‚Äîa detail so small she'd forgotten it until now. Michael had been found on the beach as a baby, the sole survivor of a mysterious shipwreck. No one had ever claimed him.

""You can't have him,"" she said, but her voice trembled.

The Man in the Waves tilted his head at an impossible angle. ""Then take his place. The deep must be fed. The bargain must be kept. Choose.""

Nora stood at the water's edge, the cold waves lapping at her feet. Behind her, she could hear Michael breathing normally for the first time in weeks, the horrible gurgling finally gone from his lungs. She had made her choice.

""A mother's sacrifice,"" the Man in the Waves whispered, now standing beside her. ""The sweetest kind.""

As she stepped into the frigid water, Nora saw shapes moving beneath the surface‚Äîpale, elongated forms that might once have been human. They reached for her with webbed hands, their faces both familiar and horrifically transformed.

""Will I become like them?"" she asked.

The Man in the Waves smiled his terrible smile. ""Oh no, my dear. You'll become something far worse.""



Martha Blackwood's house sat on the highest point of Breaker's Reach, its Victorian windows staring out at the sea like lidless eyes. For forty years, she had kept her vigil, watching for her husband's ship to return.

""James promised he'd come back,"" she told anyone who would listen. ""And James always keeps his promises.""

But lately, something had changed. The townspeople noticed her lights burning at all hours, heard her talking to someone when they passed by. And sometimes, in her largest window, they saw a second figure standing beside her‚Äîa tall, dripping shadow that seemed to flicker in and out of existence.

Dr. Chen, still troubled by Jacob Winters' case, paid Martha a visit. She found the old woman sitting in her usual chair, staring out at the storm-tossed waters.

""He's coming closer,"" Martha said without turning around. ""Every night, his ship gets a little nearer to shore. Would you like to see?""

Sarah Chen approached the window cautiously. At first, she saw only their reflections in the rain-streaked glass‚Äîher own nervous face, Martha's serene smile. Then she noticed something else: where Martha's reflection should have ended, it continued, morphing into a shape that made her brain scream in protest.

The thing that shared Martha's chair was not human. It never had been.

""Martha,"" Sarah whispered, ""how long has... that been here with you?""

""Oh, since James died,"" Martha replied cheerfully. ""Or rather, since what took James started wearing his shape. It's been keeping me company, you see. Teaching me things. Showing me what I'll become when the ship finally docks.""

Sarah backed away from the window, but it was too late. She had seen what waited in the harbor‚Äîa massive shape beneath the waves, its tentacles wrapped around a rotting ship that could only be the long-lost Meridian, James Blackwood's vessel.

""They're all coming back,"" Martha said, her voice taking on a wet, gurgling quality. ""Everyone the sea has taken. And they're bringing something with them. Something ancient. Something hungry.""

When Sarah turned back, Martha's chair was empty. Only wet footprints led to the window, which stood open to the howling storm.



The cave appeared after the landslide, a dark mouth in the cliff face that hadn't been there before. At least, that's what everyone claimed. But Tommy Chen (Sarah's teenage son) and his friends knew better. They had been watching the cliff for weeks, ever since the dreams started.

""It was always there,"" Lisa Monroe insisted. ""We just couldn't see it before. Not until it wanted us to.""

The five teenagers stood at the cave's entrance, their flashlight beams seeming to bend wrong in the darkness. The walls were covered in crude drawings‚Äîstick figures with too many limbs, surrounded by waves rendered in some dark pigment that glistened wetly despite being centuries old.

""Those are Breaker's Children,"" Brad Watson said, his voice trembling. ""My grandmother used to tell stories about them. Kids that were taken by the sea as payment for good fishing seasons.""

""That's just a story,"" Tommy said, but his voice cracked.

Deep in the cave, something moved. Water dripped rhythmically, forming puddles that reflected things that weren't there. The teenagers ventured deeper, drawn by a compulsion none of them could explain.

The passages twisted impossibly, leading down and down, until they should have been far beneath sea level. Yet they remained dry, the only water coming from the strange puddles that seemed to follow their progress.

Lisa disappeared first. One moment she was behind them, the next‚Äîonly empty tunnel. Then Brad, swallowed by a shadow that moved against the light. Tommy, Katie, and Michael pressed on, their fear now mixed with a horrible anticipation.

They found the chamber deep underground, its walls covered in newer drawings‚Äîdrawings that showed five familiar figures approaching a great dark shape. As they watched, the pigment began to move, the figures walking across the stone as if animated.

""Look at the water,"" Katie whispered.

The puddles had grown, spreading across the chamber floor. In their reflection, the teenagers saw themselves‚Äîbut wrong. Their reflections grinned with sharp teeth, their eyes glowing with bioluminescence, their fingers webbed and elongated.

""We found you,"" their reflections mouthed. ""We've been waiting so long.""

Michael was next to go, simply stepping into a puddle and vanishing beneath its impossible depth. Katie screamed once before the darkness took her.

Tommy ran. He ran until his legs gave out, through tunnels that twisted back on themselves, past drawings that reached for him with dripping hands. When he finally emerged onto the beach, the sun was setting.

He looked at his reflection in a tidal pool and saw what he had become. What they had all become.

That year, the fishing was better than anyone could remember. And in the caves beneath Breaker's Reach, five new drawings appeared on the wall, showing five figures swimming happily in the deep.



Elias Thatcher closed his journal, the leather cover slick with moisture despite the roaring fire. Outside, the storm that had been building for a century finally arrived.

""You want to know how I know all these stories?"" he asked his visitor, a young reporter who had come to document the strange events plaguing Breaker's Reach. ""Why I've been here so long? Look at my reflection.""

The reporter turned toward the window. In the glass, Elias's form wavered like something seen through deep water. Where his eyes should have been, there were only dark, empty sockets that seemed to swallow light.

""I was here when they made the bargain,"" Elias said, his voice no longer that of an old man but something ancient and wet. ""I was here when the first settlers of Breaker's Reach discovered what lived in the deep. What offered them prosperity in exchange for... tribute.""

Thunder cracked overhead, and the walls of the study wept saltwater.

""Every generation, it needs to feed. The bell rings. The traps surface. The children disappear. But this time..."" He smiled, revealing teeth that had grown sharp and numerous. ""This time is different. This time, it's coming for everything.""

The reporter tried to run, but the door had vanished, replaced by a wall of dripping coral. The windows showed not the storm outside, but the dark depths of an impossible ocean.

""Let me show you what I found in the lighthouse archives,"" Elias continued, pulling out a stack of yellowed papers. ""The original contract, signed in blood and saltwater.""

The documents revealed the terrible truth: Breaker's Reach wasn't just a town‚Äîit was a feeding ground. Every building, every street, every life was part of an intricate pattern, a huge sigil drawn in the very architecture of the place. And now, after centuries of small sacrifices, the pattern was complete.

In the harbor, something vast breached the surface. The lighthouse beam caught glimpses of flesh that should not exist in our world‚Äîtentacles the size of buildings, eyes like black holes, a maw that could swallow ships whole.

All across town, the sound of breaking glass shattered the night as the sea came flooding in‚Äîthrough windows, through pipes, through the very walls. The Murphy twins, playing in their basement, looked up to see water pouring down the stairs, carrying with it all the lost children of Breaker's Reach, their faces transformed by decades beneath the waves.

At the museum, Marion Hayes's figurine collection burst from their cases, growing to full size as they stalked the halls. Jacob Winters led them, his body now a twisted fusion of man and deep-sea horror.

The Man in the Waves appeared on every street corner, multiplying himself to guide the townsfolk toward the harbor. Behind him walked Martha Blackwood, her form shifting between elderly widow and something with too many limbs and phosphorescent eyes.

In the cave, Tommy Chen and his transformed friends emerged, leading a procession of pale, twisted shapes‚Äîall the children taken over the centuries, now returning to claim their living relatives.

""You see,"" Elias explained to the terrified reporter, ""the bargain was never about fish or prosperity. That was just... maintenance feeding. The thing in the deep needed to be sustained until it could gather enough power to manifest fully. Every death, every disappearance, every small horror added another thread to its web.""

The storm reached its peak. The waves rose higher than physics should allow, forming walls of water that curled over the town like grasping fingers. In their depths, faces could be seen‚Äîeveryone the sea had ever taken, now part of something greater and more terrible.

""What happens now?"" the reporter whispered.

Elias's form began to dissolve, revealing something underneath that had never been human. ""Now? Now Breaker's Reach becomes what it was always meant to be‚Äîa gate. A beginning. The first of many such places.""

The roof tore away, revealing a sky that was no longer sky but a vast, dark ocean. The thing in the harbor rose fully from the water, its true form driving those who saw it to madness. As the reporter watched in horror, the buildings of Breaker's Reach began to transform, their structures twisting into organic shapes that pulsed with horrible life.

The last thing the reporter saw before the water took them was Elias‚Äînow a towering figure of tentacles and eyes‚Äîraising his arms to the inverted ocean above. Around him, the transformed townspeople sang in voices that broke the laws of nature, calling their god to feast.

Breaker's Reach disappeared that night. Maps would later show only open ocean where the town had been. But sometimes, on dark nights when the storm winds blow just right, sailors report seeing lights beneath the waves‚Äîan entire town going about its business under the sea, its inhabitants swimming through flooded streets, waiting for unwary vessels to venture too close.

And in other coastal towns, someone might notice a new resident‚Äîan old man with eyes like the deep, who sits in his study telling stories about the place that was once called Breaker's Reach, watching as the waves creep ever closer to their doors.



The newspaper clipping is yellowed with age:

COASTAL TOWN VANISHES IN FREAK STORM

Search and Rescue Efforts Find No Survivors

\[Date Redacted\]

But below the headline, in wet ink that never seems to dry, someone has written:

""The sea does not give up what it takes. It only transforms it. And somewhere, in the depths where light has never reached, Breaker's Reach still stands‚Äîa city of the drowned, waiting for the next feeding. Listen for the bell. Watch for the traps. And whatever you do, don't look too long at your reflection in the tide pools. You might see what you're becoming.""

We are both GoT fans and I love to banter about it with *Paul, who I have been dating for 2 months. I really like him and he is super sweet. However his quotes are becoming really demeaning and feel like he is negging me. Am I over reacting? 

When we were at a friends party Paul said towards a group of mainly a few of my friends, Pauls says about me (*Sarah) in front of them ""We have our differences, Sarah and I. She is braver; I am better looking.""'This was really embarrassing for me because I think some of them didn't get the reference and now think the guy l'm dating doesn't think l'm that good looking. 

Another occasion we were making out, and Paul whispered in my ear in a silly voice ""You have less honor than a back alley whore. 

I got really angry because I didn't recognise that it was a quote from GoT. I jumped up from the couch and he said ""chill out it's a game of thrones quote from such and such episode."" I told him that I was really upset and are leaving his house now and he just replied with ""'I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me."" 

That was it. lts like he had no remorse for what he had done and just thinks upsetting me is funny! 

I haven't answered his txts or calls since , it has been 2 days. Am I over reacting?

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7p52rm/me_24f_and_the_guy_who_made_the_game_of_thrones/)¬† **Jan 9, 2018 (2 months later)** 

[Copy of the update](https://imgur.com/a/DZkU1CC) 

I can't post this as an 'update' because reddit locked the original post, I think maybe because of too many comments? 

Anyway, a few people on here may remember the post that gained a lot of attention on this forum about the guy I was dating who made the Game of Thrones themed negs towards me. If you didn't, here is the re cap, basically, I had been dating a guy called *Paul for two months, who would quote certain things from GoT at very inopportune times in such a way that he was negging me. He then sent me a few stupid txts which I didn't reply to. The post garnered so much attention on Reddit, that someone who knew him, saw it, and sent it to him, and *Paul ended up dumping me because he saw that I posted about it, before I could dump him. He blocked me on everything and then unblocked me asking me to remove the post, to which I didn't reply, left it up, and eventually reddit deleted it. 

Fast forward one month later and I see Paul on tinder, and super like him as a joke. He matched me back, and actually messaged me saying something really funny about all that had happened. We joked in a good natured way about what went down which eventually led to us hashing things out, and we got back together, and not long after officially became boyfriend and girlfriend. The whole reddit post saga became a quirky story (one that we mostly keep to ourselves) and even a running joke between the two of us, and he defiantly lightened up to it. I think the experience of it maybe made him take himself a lot less seriously and learn to see the funny side of things... at better times. 

No, Paul didn't make any Game of Thrones jokes again. 

He moved into my place at the beginning of Dec when his lease ran out and things were great, but only for a week. Initially, we split the costs of everything evenly. However Paul majorly upped his coffee habits due to an increased work load trying to make sales. But he even started drinking as much on the weekend, 90% of the time around the apartment he always had a cup of tea or coffee in his hand. 

It never made him jittery or anything, but it did make him stay up a couple of hours later each night which was very disruptive to our normal nighttime routine. 

Also it wasn't cheap coffee he was drinking + he would also get 2 takeaway coffees everyday (or so he claimed), as well as him buying lunch at work every week day. He has apparently had no money to contribute to groceries for the past month, yet he is buying to takeaway coffees and lunch at work every weekday, as well as a relatively expensive type of coffee to be drinking at home. But he said that if we are in this for the long term I needed to understand that his job is stressful at this time of year. And so I felt too bad to ask him to stop buying his pleasures at work around this time of year so paid for all of our groceries myself. 

However the worst part of the problem came when we went to my family house for Christmas. He bought his own stupid brand of coffee with him to use (we were only there for two days). And so it was really awkward when we all had coffee/cocoa and he would decline my familys offer of coffee and insisted on making his own seperate one. We got into a huge fight later over this and I told him he was being uptight and rude and he told me I was looking for issues in him and that no one is perfect. 

On Saturday afternoon he broke up with me. He told me that he started to emotionally shut down after the fight we had at Christmas and he wanted to end things, and that we don't realistically have enough things in common. He was able to move out that day because he doesn't have that many belongings and we only kept a couple of pieces of his furniture when he moved in. 

I'm completley heartbroken and haven't gone to work yet, and I feel taken advantage of. I don't understand how someone could change their opinion of me so drastically after one little fight. Obviously it's over, I know it is. But it doesn't make it hurt less and it just seems so out of the blue. 

tl;dr: We got back together, but of course threw it back in my face.

We had a roommate who had bpd, who when they first moved in were on their meds, were going to therapy, helped when they could, etc. Unfortunately the doing good things were an act and they stopped going to therapy, stopped taking their anti psychotics, and went from 5-6 times the max dose of benzos to going cold turkey off them. They stole thousands of dollars, mostly from my friend but also hundreds of dollars from me, broke my shit, we were constantly taking care of their animals, etc.

 I have tried every trick, watched videos on it, waited for luck days and I just still CANNOT reach level 100, that's all I want and I'm ready to throw my switch out the window. And it's not even that I die in the cavern, I have the galaxy sword, I bring plenty of food, usually eggplant parm, coffee and red plates. I have the warp totem recipe, I will go there right when I wake up, I use bombs and staircases and I just cannot get to level 100 before the clock hits 2 am. So honestly I am getting desperate and I'm pretty much ready to put this game down again just from frustration. So I guess I just want to know if there is literally anything else I can do I am DESPERATE.

The walls of any room provide a canvas for creativity. Adding wall decoration not only enhances the visual appeal but also sets the tone for the room. From bold abstract art to rustic wooden panels, there are countless ways to make your walls a focal point.

* Tip: For a contemporary yet inviting vibe, try incorporating boho wall decor like macram√© hangings, woven baskets, or patterned tapestries. These pieces bring texture and warmth, transforming blank walls into artful displays.

**2. Play with Decorative Items for the Living Room**

Your living room often serves as the heart of your home, so it‚Äôs the perfect place to experiment with accent pieces. Introduce decorative vases, stylish coffee table books, or unique sculptures to add personality.

A soft rug or throw can instantly elevate the ambiance of a room. Opt for designs that complement your accent pieces, whether it‚Äôs a Moroccan rug for a boho vibe or a minimal geometric design for a modern touch.

**6. Create a Focal Point with Lighting**

Accent lighting plays a crucial role in transforming a space. Consider pendant lights, table lamps, or fairy lights to highlight your decorative items for the living room. Lighting not only enhances the atmosphere but also brings attention to the accent pieces you've carefully curated.

Whether you‚Äôre revamping your living space or designing an outdoor oasis, there are countless options that blend sustainability with modern aesthetics.

**Tips for Choosing Eco-Friendly Furniture**

* **Look for certifications:** Ensure the furniture is certified by organizations like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or GREENGUARD.

In fact, with the right furniture and thoughtful design, small spaces can feel cozy, functional, and even luxurious. The art lies in choosing versatile pieces that maximize utility without overwhelming the room. Whether you're decorating a studio apartment or a compact living area, here‚Äôs a guide to making smart furniture choices that transform your small space into a haven.

# 1. Prioritize Multi-Functional Furniture

When space is limited, every piece of furniture should work double duty. Look for items like ottomans with hidden storage, fold-out tables, or sofa beds. A [small 2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) is an excellent choice for a compact living room, offering comfort without consuming too much floor space. Opt for designs with slim arms and raised legs to create the illusion of openness.

# 2. Use Vertical Space Wisely

In small spaces, vertical space is your best friend. Add shelving units or wall-mounted cabinets to store books, decor, or other essentials. Pair these with elegant [table lamps](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/lighting/table-lamps) to create a functional yet stylish look. Table lamps not only provide essential lighting but also serve as a design statement, making your space feel warm and inviting.

# 3. Choose Furniture with Clean Lines

Bulky, ornate furniture can make a small room feel cramped. Instead, choose furniture with clean lines and simple designs. A [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sofas) with a minimalist aesthetic is perfect for creating an airy and modern vibe. Match it with a lightweight coffee table or nesting tables that can be tucked away when not in use.

# 4. Opt for Light and Neutral Colors

Light colors like whites, creams, and pastels help reflect light, making a small room feel larger. If you‚Äôre selecting a **small 2 seater sofa**, go for a neutral tone and pair it with colorful cushions to add character without overwhelming the room. Similarly, select table lamps in subtle shades to complement your decor.

# 5. Focus on Proportions and Scale

Furniture that‚Äôs too large will dominate the room, while pieces that are too small can feel out of place. Strike a balance by carefully measuring your space and selecting furniture with proportions that fit comfortably. A **small 2 seater sofa** or a bistro dining set can be ideal for compact spaces, providing functionality without overcrowding.

# 6. Incorporate Mirrors and Reflective Surfaces

Mirrors are a clever way to make a room feel bigger. Position a large mirror opposite a window to bounce natural light around the room. Pair this with sleek table lamps that feature metallic or glass bases to enhance the sense of space and brightness.

# 7. Use Accent Pieces to Add Personality

Accent pieces, like rugs, throws, or artwork, can inject personality into your small space without taking up extra room. A strategically placed **table lamp** with an interesting design can serve as both a functional and decorative piece, adding a warm and inviting touch to your home.

# 8. Stay Organized with Smart Storage Solutions

Clutter is the enemy of small spaces. Invest in furniture that offers built-in storage, like a **small 2 seater sofa** with a storage compartment or a bench with hidden cubbies. Keep your space tidy to maintain the illusion of spaciousness.

# 9. Consider Modular and Convertible Furniture

Modular furniture allows you to adapt your layout to suit your needs. For instance, modular shelving units can act as a room divider in a studio apartment while providing storage. A convertible sofa or extendable dining table ensures your furniture adapts to your lifestyle, even in a small space.

# 10. Create Zones for Functionality

Define distinct zones in your small space to make it more functional. Use rugs or furniture placement to delineate areas for lounging, dining, or working. A compact desk paired with a comfortable chair and a stylish **table lamp** can serve as a dedicated workspace without intruding on the living area.

# Final Thoughts

Decorating a small space is all about balance, creativity, and thoughtful furniture selection. By choosing pieces like a **small 2 seater sofa**, stylish **table lamps**, and multifunctional furniture, you can maximize functionality while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing environment. Remember, the key is to focus on quality over quantity and to let your personal style shine through, even in a compact setting.

I came back to school feeling like giving my city a chance. And 2 months later, I can feel my depression fully sinking back in and increasingly hate the people I‚Äôm surrounded by.

I want to move abroad, but the plan I have in mind is to get an MBA in 3/4 years in order to get the visa. In the mean time the plan is to stay where I am with a job in the field that I am, but it feels like there has to be a better way. 

I don‚Äôt even have confidence I can get a decent job in my field (not a fear, there‚Äôs a difference)

I just want to take a gap year and live abroad, but then in a year I‚Äôll be stuck with the same situation. That‚Äôs irresponsible and honestly not going to help me.

I just went to the river bank/nearby trails and released my dog and started walking, making sure she knew I had treats in my pocket. I knew this was kind of risky but I figured what the hell, she likes me, she knows I have treats. She came back and kept coming back. When she returns she gets love and a treat. 

Almost immediately things got better. Occasionally encountering other off leash dogs is going way better than the manic/out of control gang-play that occurs sometimes in dog parks. I am finding a ""better quality"" of owners most of the time, not the wanting-to-socialize, standing around drinking coffee types, but people that seem to have better control over their dogs while allowing them freedom. 

Her recall is about 80-90 percent now after only 10 days, and when she doesn't come right away she'll come after a few glances back. I'm never going back to the dog park.

These steps might feel insignificant, but they are a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered.

What if you could take this everyday activity and turn it into something meaningful for your health and fitness? That‚Äôs where tracking and measuring your steps come in.

By simply tracking the steps you already take, you can turn walking into an active habit that‚Äôs both fun and rewarding. It‚Äôs not about adding a huge workout to your day but about recognizing and celebrating what you‚Äôre already doing. Once you start tracking, you‚Äôll find small goals easier to achieve, like adding a few hundred more steps or walking for five more minutes.

Over time, these small changes snowball into something bigger. A few extra steps today become a more energized tomorrow. You‚Äôll start seeing progress‚Äîboth in how you feel and in what you accomplish.

Walking doesn‚Äôt need to be complicated to be impactful. It‚Äôs the simplest, most accessible way to care for your body and mind. With a small nudge‚Äîlike tracking your steps‚Äîyou can make each walk an intentional part of your journey to better health.

So, start today. Track those steps, measure your progress, and enjoy the satisfaction of seeing your health grow, step by step. What was once a passive habit can become the cornerstone of an active, vibrant lifestyle.

1gyipyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CloudFlare/comments/1gyipyw/my_error_523_mystery_adventure/,My Error 523 Mystery Adventure,"I can't really explain what it was, or what it looks like. But that thing... it scared me.

I have struggled with Cloudflare having very odd inconsistencies with my service hosting.

Everything always seems to work fine on my subdomains when I access my services locally \[same internet service as the origin, not locally as in local network (192.168.1.1).\] or very strangely semi-locally (LTE/5G phone service within the same building my origin is in) but when I actually am PHYSICALLY remote from the origin, one device will load my services via domain, the other will error 523. Then they'll both 523, then they both work. Who knows, seems random and very erratic.

All the while, on local-net or previously described semi-local, they work all the time consistently. I'm in Canada by the way, not some backwater rural routing issue.

It ended up being a bad interaction with my SECONDARY DNS server entries on my localnet... at least I think so...

Basically, everything was setup to call the local DNS first (lets say 192.168.1.110) then secondarily call the local gateway if that failed (192.168.1.1).

[192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) calls the local gateway first (192.168.1.110) then if no luck will call 1.1.1.1 among other public DNS options.

The fix was just cutting out the middle man (192.168.1.1).

Cloudflare didn't play nice with NGINX falling back to the gateway for DNS lookups. Why it would matter seeing as local gateway also points to the main local DNS first, and then [1.1.1.1](http://1.1.1.1) as a backup, I'm not sure. But after removing the local gateway lookup [192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1) and instead using our own local DNS (192.168.1.110) and the public DNS IPs directly with NGINX and all other hosts before the gateway in the network; It all came together.

Oddest issue I've ever had with hosting. Still not sure that was really what was wrong, but it's all that I changed, other than leaving on ""I'm under attack"" mode, which seemed to HELP, but not FIX the aforementioned strangeness.

Perhaps it's got more to do with how the PVE host that's running NGINX handles secondary DNS than NGINX, Clownflare, or the hardware itself, perhaps a bad combo soup of all those factors. I really can't say, but burping all calls to gateway for DNS server before the gateway itself, and instead of letting that gateway, again, AS A SECONDARY FALLBACK OPTION call our local DNS and public options... just calling the local DNS and public options directly from PVE, NGINX, all services on the localnet, has seemed to fix my 523 errors.

Also for anyone playing at home, yes. The gateway works fine on all other devices as the main DNS call, Just seems when the network is set up that way, it for some reason screws with couldflare, but only some of the time, and only on a TRUELY remote location connection. Again, different network (LTE) on a phone in the same building, NO PROBLEM, go down the street to a coffee shop with that same phone on LTE, BORKED!.... though I have NO idea why.

Found this out totally on a whim, by the way. Just gave it a try and noticed that the reports of the problem basically flat-lined after. Didn't even know what to look for and I'm damn lucky I stumbled on this ""fix"" within two days because wireshark was getting me nowhere, I was going to suggest we drop cloudflare, and I was wondering how I was going to explain why, because ""I don't know, it's just not working consistently"" is about the worst way to pitch that much hassle. Besides, it couldn't be them at fault, it was just affecting us. We all knew it was an internal issue, but nobody figured it out in the end. Not even me, really.

My hair lives another day. Still, nothing worse than solutions to networking problems via roll for luck. If you all have any theories, let me know!

Anyway, this happened weeks ago, and it's been fine since. Still, if any of you out there have ideas on the real cause, I'd love to hear your takes!",1,1732422521.0,CloudFlare,5,0.67,False

Someone ordered a double double, which in Canada is a coffee with two creams and two sugars. I made that, without clarifying what a double double is. I brought it to them, they said ‚Äúis this half milk?‚Äù I said no. They asked me to remake it. I just did it but I regret it. I should‚Äôve said they got what they ordered (right??)

Someone ordered an iced drink. They did not ask for light ice. They asked me to remake it with less ice because they ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt even get the straw to the bottom‚Äù???? I remade it, but it seemed like such a stupid complaint.

1gyinpa,https://i.redd.it/jp822cny0s2e1.jpeg,Is this Arabica Coffee plant saveable?,"The plants leaves began turning brown from the ends of the leafs and eventually drying out and dying. I thought that it may have been a root crowding problem as the plant was in a small pot for its size at that time. I transplanted the plant and the roots were quite crowded together. I removed most of the old soil from the roots and planted it in a larger pot with new soil. Im not sure if this helped as the plant continued to get worse to the point where i had to remove the majority of leaves as they were damaged beyond repair. I now believe it is something fungal. I removed all damaged leaves and sprayed the plant with fungicide. Just recently, the remaining leaves have started drooping even though the plant is receiving enough water. I am currently in the winter season, but the room the plant is in stays between 20-25¬∞C and receives lower light from the window and occasionally a grow light. I would really like to save this plant if still possible.
