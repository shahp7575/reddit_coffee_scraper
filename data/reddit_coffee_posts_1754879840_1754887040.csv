1mn3o5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1mn3o5k/how_ive_been_beating_the_sunday_scaries_lately/,How I’ve Been Beating the Sunday Scaries Lately,"Hey everyone,  just wanted to share a few small things I’ve been doing to ease that awful Sunday anxiety (aka the Sunday Scaries). I used to dread Sunday evenings, like this creeping stress about the upcoming week, but these quick habits have actually helped me feel a lot more grounded:

1. Plan Ahead - I’ve started taking 10-15 minutes on Sunday to plan out some basics for the week, things like outfits, meal ideas, and a rough to-do list. Nothing intense, just enough so I’m not waking up on Monday feeling totally unprepared.
2. Make Time for Real Self Care - I used to doomscroll all evening and call it ""relaxing"", but lately I’ve been more intentional. I take a bath, read a book, or just sit outside with tea. Doing something that actually recharges me makes a huge difference.
3. Protect Sunday from Work Thoughts - I’ve set a hard boundary: no emails, no “just checking something real quick” for work. Sunday is my time. If my brain starts spiraling into work mode, I redirect it.
4. Gratitude (yes, it sounds cheesy but it works) - I’ve been writing down 3 small things I’m grateful for every Sunday. Sometimes it’s just “good coffee” or “my dog being cute.” It really does shift my mindset from anxious to more grounded.
5. Move a Little - Not a full workout or anything, but a walk around the block, a short stretch session, or just dancing around while cleaning up. It gets me out of my head and into my body, which helps a ton.

Anyway, just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else dreads Sundays like I used to. These small things don’t ""solve"" everything, but they’ve made Sunday evenings feel more like actual rest than a panic spiral.

Would love to hear if anyone else has little rituals that help?

Hope you’re all doing okay ❤️",1,1754886796.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

I (17F) started a job at a coffee shop after I quit working at a retail job to try something new. I’ve always loved making coffees and a fast paced environment. They said that i got the job but I’ve got 3 trial shifts which was fine. I did two of my trial shifts at a different store as the store i was going to wasn’t built yet.

When the store finally got built, i had my last trial shift (which they didnt technically tell me those were trial shifts, but i found out they were online) last Saturday. It went great! The people that went through loved that the coffee shop was built, i had good conversations with customers and i was fast with taking orders. 

After my shift i was VERY tired so i had a nap for about an hour. My phone was on charge in the kitchen (outlet problems in my room) and then i heard a text notification. I went down and grabbed my phone and saw that the message (roster company sent it) said i was no longer rostered for the next two weeks. I was very confused, and when i went on the app that has all of our chats for shift swapping, updates ect, i was logged out and my phone number was no longer available for the company. I thought it was some glitch, so my dad took me down and the area manager told me that they sent me an email saying I didn’t pass and they said it as in a pity way. I left bawling my eyes out as now I don’t have a job anymore. I ended up finding the email and they never told me why I didn’t pass. 

WEIRD THINGS THAT HAPPENED BEFOREHAND: 

they were changing my shift times without asking me (example, they changed my 8-11am Saturday shift to 6:30am-11am without asking me) which is fine because im completely fine working those hours, I just thought it was weird they didn’t ask me first. 

Another one is that they never showed me how to make the coffees during those shifts yet everyone else did, so I just thought it was a coincidence.

They were praising me how good I was doing, then they threw this at me for no reason? In an email? And then they just cut me off the books?

They gave me no reason why I didn’t pass. I thought I was doing well.

They also put me on the roster two weeks out, which again they were also changing without consulting me first.

Am I overreacting? My parents are hating them for it because it absolutely destroyed me. Are they just poor at management or am I just being silly right now?",1,1754886535.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I (19m) was speaking to this girl,(21-22not sure) we’re both in college. We met once about a year ago with some friends and I remember her saying my accent was cute and a bit of flirting. After that I didn't talk or msg her for a year. Then, out of nowhere, she texted me recently.

Now we’ve got plans to grab coffee. It’s not officially a date or anything, but it also doesn’t feel like just a normal friend hangout and we've been texting a bit.

I’m kind of overthinking things — like where should we go so it’s not awkward? And also, do I pay? I don’t want to make it some big thing.

Has anyone else been in this kind of situation? How did you handle it?

TLDR; the guy who molested me has moved even closer to me and it’s making me feel unsafe. I want to live a normal life but this new development is setting me back mentally. 


When I was 8 years old I was molested multiple times by a friend’s older brother. It was horrific and traumatizing. For context I grew up in a very small town. He would pretend nothing happened (I guess I did too, I was in shock for a while and never told anyone until I was 18) even shortly after the events he would say hi (my name) if we ran into each other in public. Even as a child I remember thinking “how could you say hi to me after what you did to me” my friend would invite me to church and I would go with them on Sundays to church (it was always a different church) and they’d drop me off at my house, I also look exactly the same as when I was a child and he knows who I am. In 2022 I was living at home and felt the need to report the moelstation to the police. The detective was amazing and to no surprise there was nothing he could do but he told the guy to stay away from me and avoid me at all cost. anyways I guess flash forward to current ish. He moved to my street about 10 years ago? And he works for the town we are from (my parents still live there and I visit frequently) he picks up garbage and sweeps sidewalks. That’s it. He’s always walked by my house. I’m very used to looking both ways before I leave my house as to not run into him. Last week I noticed his car parked near my house on my street. I know his car because I’ve seen him drive it many times. He’s either driving or walking on my street it feels like. We (me and my parents) are worried he moved closer down towards our house and that’s why his car has been parked closer to us. He’s lived ON the street for years but a few blocks away. I recently in the past 2 years have somehow managed to grow out of my displaced anger towards my parents (I used to have inner anger at them for choosing to live here but now I realize that I can completely see why parents would want to raise their families here.) I used to hate my hometown and want to move out, I did, but damn am I jealous of people who I went to school with who ended up becoming teachers in the school district, or never leaving because they just like it here. I’m not saying I was the only person molested in my hometown, of course sometimes it feels like that, but I know it can’t be true (although I do hope it is true) I’m very happy my parents chose to live here because of the diversity and it is a very cute town. I know it’s easy to say but I know for a fact if he didn’t live here, i would feel safe here. If you asked me when I was a teenager what I would do if I won the lottery, I would have said take my family and move. Now, I would give him a chunk and say go wherever you want and don’t come back.

Seeing his car just outside my house is putting me close to a breaking point. I’m ANGRY. I am depressed and pissed. He knows where I live, the detective told him to stay away from me and to never go near me, to walk and drive down. different streets. I’m at a point mentally where I’m desperate to live the life or feel like I have the life I did before I was molested. I want to go to places in town, I have, but he is always there. I went to a coffee shop in town because I was sitting in my backyard and noticed he was walking the opposite direction so I took the opportunity to go and try to feel normal. When I’m done paying for what I got, I turn around and he’s there. It’s too much. I can’t even get coffee without him being there. I know it’s like at what point do I just say whatever and live my life and do stuff in my hometown despite his existence. I know firsthand how hard it is. It sucks. I feel uncomfortable when he sees me and looks at me. I revert to my coping skills of not leaving the house or dressing in completely covered up, butch clothes to make myself look less appealing. I am at a point where I am depressed, anxious, and my paranoia is through the roof. ",1,1754886193.0,Advice,0,0.67,False

Act One
 
There’s a silence that lives in the moments before morning. A hush not of stillness, but of readiness. As if the day itself waits in the wings—nervous, excited, trembling slightly under the weight of the curtain.
 
And then… cue the light.
 
It filters in warm through the open window—an amber haze that lands not arbitrarily, but with intention. It rests across the cheek of the man in the bed as if chosen. As if earned. He doesn’t flinch. Not at first. He inhales slowly, a chest rising with perfect tempo, and then—he grins. A slow smile, foolish and full. The kind a child might wear when they remember it’s their birthday before the cake is even baked. He opens his eyes as though it’s a pleasure, not a burden. He stretches, not with a groan, but a sway. One leg finds the floor, then the other, and before gravity can remember its role, he’s already aloft.
 
Not walking. Not quite. Gliding.
 
Across the wooden floors of his apartment, he dances. Barefoot. Effortless. He twirls past the curtains—long, billowy things that catch the morning light like soft stage scrims. The city waits beyond them, not bustling, but smiling. No horns. No voices. No clatter. Only a few petals that drift past his window on some invisible breeze, as though the season had sent him a bouquet in motion.
 
The kettle whistles on cue.
 
He waltzes to it, removing it from the burner with a flourish of the wrist. A white mug waits near the sink, its handle turned just so, as if it had dressed itself this morning to be ready for him. He pours, the steam rising like fog across a footlit stage. He closes his eyes again, breathes it in.
 
His fish watches from the bowl by the window.
 
And then—so help you—it dances. A bob. A dart. A shimmering twirl as it spins through its little globe of glass. He taps the bowl in rhythm. The fish flicks its tail in reply.
 
He chuckles. “You’re ready for Broadway,” he says, and gives a stately tip of the head.
 
Back to the center of the apartment. A wardrobe stands tall like a co-star waiting in the wings. He opens it, selects the suit—today, a slate grey with silk black lapels, pressed to perfection. A tie the color of crushed berries. Shoes so polished you’d think they were dipped in mirror.
 
He dresses like a man who’s never known a misstep. One button at a time, humming as he goes.
 
And then—oh, then—breakfast. Two eggs, cooked with a flourish. Toast arched high from the toaster like stage props sprung from the floorboards. He plate-spins, pirouettes, flips the eggs onto the dish with a motion just shy of magic. Coffee, toast, eggs, and a slice of honeyed fruit—balanced atop a tray as he dances to the table. Even the chair seems to slide out for him on its own.
 
He eats slowly. Smiling. Joyful. Not grateful. Why would he be grateful for a gift he gives himself every day?
 
He finishes the last sip of coffee, wipes the corners of his mouth with a neatly folded napkin, and glances at the clock on the wall. Time to go.
 
He shrugs on his coat. A single movement, like a cape unfurling. His shoes clack once against the floor as he turns toward the door, then stops. He raises a finger in parting to the fish.
 
“You’ve been a lovely audience.”
 
The fish bows. Or maybe blinks. He takes it as both.
 
He opens the door. And the city is waiting.
 
The stoop doesn’t lead down so much as unfold—three shallow steps onto a stage built just for him. The lighting is perfect. The wind? Composed. A sidewalk set by gods with immaculate taste.
 
He descends in rhythm. One, two, three. Snap. Ball change. Plié. Jazz hands.
 
The music in his head builds. Swells. He spins out into the street, arms wide.
 
No people. No cars. No dogs yapping or food carts hissing. Just the occasional flurry of pigeons that rise in time with his leap from one square of sidewalk to the next.
 
He passes storefronts with mannequins that appear to smile. Mailboxes that tip slightly in greeting. A bicycle bell chimes in the distance—no rider in sight. The light changes—green, always green.
 
He sings now. Wordless, tuneful joy. He knows the notes without knowing how. The melody belongs to him, and the city hums along.
 
He pauses at a corner, steps aside, and with a playful smile tips an imaginary hat. “Pardon me, madame. May I cut in?” And dances into the crosswalk.
 
He spins once more. Arms open wide. Face tilted to the sky.
 
He’s not on his way to work. He’s on his way to purpose. And purpose is everything.
 
And then, rounding a quiet corner, he sees it.
 
The theater.His cathedral. His heart. His home.
 
But not yet.
 
First, he stops. Places one hand gently across his chest, head lowered. A reverent pause.
 
“Good morning, darling,” he says to the old marquee. The letters, arranged just so, spell the name of the show he’s starred in for years. It needs no updating. The bulbs blink in sequence, as if winking.
 
He ascends the stairs. One step. Two. Three. The doors open before he touches them.
 
And inside—it’s empty. Of course it is.
 
The chandeliers are aglow, but no audience waits. The velvet carpet is soft beneath his feet. He glides through the lobby. Past the ticket booth. The velvet ropes. The posters that bear his name.
 
He hums.
 
Through the double doors. Down the aisle. The rows and rows and rows of empty seats curve like arms, ready to embrace.
 
He smiles at them, as if greeting old friends. “Again? You’ve come again?” he says softly. “Oh, you’re too kind. Drinks after the curtain—on me.”
 
He steps onto the stage.
 
Breathes.
 
The house lights warm his face like sun on a windowsill. He walks to the edge, sits, and lets his feet dangle—like a child. He kicks them softly.
 
He laughs.
 
He wraps his arms around himself and leans forward, basking.
 
This is love. This is mastery. This is home.
 
He could sit there forever. But he doesn’t. Because the show must go on.
 
 
Act Two
 
Crickety-clack. The dressing room door closes behind him—not a thud, but a beat. One more step in the choreography.
 
He doesn’t simply enter. He arrives. A pivot on one heel. A slide across the lacquered floorboards. A casual toss of the coat, lofted like a cape over the back of the chair. He grins to no one in particular. Maybe to the mirror. Maybe to the room.
 
“Made it,” he says, breathlessly, as though he’d crossed a finish line only he could see.
 
The room greets him in silence. It is a familiar quiet—soft, heavy, and deliberate. The hush of wood and velvet. The breath of powder and old paper. The dressing room doesn’t creak or hum. It simply waits.
 
The mirror stands in place, unmoved. Wide. Tall. Ringed with a halo of frosted bulbs that glow a steady amber. Not bright. Not cold. Just warm enough to touch, but not warm enough to trust.
 
He doesn’t sit. Not yet.
 
Instead, he begins to undress. Not hurried. Not lazy. Practiced. The jacket first—shrugged off with a little shoulder roll and a fingertip flourish, spun once on his finger before he drapes it over the rack. The tie, loosened with two fingers and whipped once in the air like a ribbon before hanging it neatly. He hums a bar or two—soft, tuneless, content.
 
The shirt buttons, undone one by one, from throat to waist. He plucks each like a piano key. The undershirt lifts overhead with a quick, graceful sweep. Even the slacks—he steps out of them with a half-kick, one heel flicking behind him. A little laugh. Barefoot now, in the quiet. He twirls once for no one.
 
And then the stretch—arms above the head, fingers steepled, spine bowed slightly back. He inhales. This is the last breath of the man who danced through the streets.
 
And then the costume waits. Hanging there like a question. Crisp. Expectant.
 
He doesn’t rush it. He approaches it. One leg, then the other. He slides into the pressed black slacks, cinches the waistband, fastens the clasp. A white undershirt follows. Then the vest—charcoal with black piping, buttons like eyes watching him as he fastens each one.
 
He sits to pull on the shoes. Patent leather. Gleaming. He can see the blur of his own face in them. They shine more than they should. He ties the laces once. Then again.
 
His hands are slower now. Not clumsy—but less fluid. His breath has shortened. His posture changed. The sway in his spine replaced by straight lines. Angles. Intent.
 
He stands and adjusts. The shoulders. The collar. The cuffs. The pant legs. He runs his hand down each thigh, smoothing invisible imperfections. The transformation is nearly complete.
 
Now the face. A mirror to the soul.
 
He moves to the vanity and lays out the tools. The comb. The brush. The white towel, folded in quarters. The compact. The rouge. The liner. The powder. A glass of water, half full, placed just left of center. Each item takes its position like players on a stage. Each one a weapon against what’s underneath.
 
He hums as he works. Not a melody now—just a droning note. Familiar. Unnamed. A thread from some forgotten tune. It echoes slightly in the quiet, caught between glass and skin.
 
He reaches for the script. The pages are worn. Soft at the corners. A flick of the thumb, and it opens to the monologue. He recites the first line under his breath. Not loud. Not for anyone. Just enough to feel the shape of it in his mouth.
 
He finally sits. The chair gives just a little under his weight—a low creak like a whisper. His knees fall open. His arms rest on the counter. He leans forward.
 
And then… he sees himself. Not just his reflection. Himself.
 
There’s a second of pause. Maybe less. The kind of pause no one else would notice—but he does. He always does.
 
He blinks. The lights around the mirror flicker once. Not in failure. In fatigue. They recover quickly, but something has already shifted. The warmth they offered a moment ago now feels performative. Painted on.
 
He reaches for the powder. The puff lands soft against his cheek. Tap. Tap. Sweep. He leans closer. Closer. He holds his breath and dusts again. He watches the skin disappear. Not vanish. Not hide. Just… soften. Blur. Become acceptable. A second puff, beneath the chin.
 
Then the liner. The smallest brush in the tray. Black, precise. He draws the line the way a soldier edges a blade—steady hand, shallow breath. One lid. Then the other.
 
He blinks again. The man in the mirror does too—but somehow… later.
 
His eyes return to the script. He speaks the line again. A little louder. Not because he wants to—but because he needs to hear it right. The phrasing. The cadence. The breath between syllables.
 
He gets it wrong. He swallows.
 
Back to the mirror. A dab of color to the cheeks. Not enough to shout. Just enough to be seen. The final touch.
 
And then he stares.Not long. But long enough.
 
The humming stops. He doesn’t know when. He doesn’t start it again.
 
His fingers twitch.
 
He stands, but slower than he sat. Adjusts the tie. Smooths the lapels. His hand lingers at his chest. He presses—twice. Reassurance? Reminder? Ritual?
 
He turns back toward the door. And stops. His hand on the knob. His body still angled toward the mirror. As if waiting for the man in the glass to move first.
 
He doesn’t. Neither does the reflection. But they both know what comes next.
 
 
Act Three
 
The door opens. Not with drama. Not with dread. Just with a gentle, resigned swing—as though it already knows what waits on the other side.
 
He steps through.
 
And the moment he does, the air changes. Gone is the warmth of solitude. In its place: backstage—a living artery of movement and anticipation. This is not chaos. This is orchestration.
 
A costumer threads sequins into a bodice under a desk lamp. A lighting tech tests cues with fingers tapping against her clipboard like a conductor’s baton. A dancer stretches near a wall, limbs trembling with readiness. Someone hums a scale. Another counts silently with their fingers—one, two, three, four… one, two, three, four…
 
He walks among them. Slow. Silent. Purposeful.
 
His shoes make a sound that only he seems to notice. Not loud, but deliberate. A clean, confident rhythm that’s been polished over years. Heel. Toe. Glide. Heel. Toe. Glide. Each step forward carries the weight of expectation. Not theirs. His. Because whether they’re looking or not—he feels seen.
 
A pair of actors laugh softly as he passes, rehearsing lines between breaths. Another brushes past him, nods politely. “You’ll be brilliant,” the man says. But it washes over him like rain hitting a pane of glass—acknowledged only as a sound, not a meaning. He nods back, rehearsed, unsure if the gesture even finished. Because his mind is elsewhere. Because he’s already hearing it—
 
The crowd.
 
It starts in pieces. A laugh near the back. A seat creaking open. The rustle of silk and cotton. Programs folding. Unfolding. Folding again. A cough. Another. The sound of someone unwrapping a mint they’ve already decided not to eat.
 
He keeps walking.
 
The hallway narrows. The lights dim. The carpet absorbs his steps, but the air doesn’t. It grows thicker with every breath, as if judgment itself has taken shape in the silence ahead.
 
He straightens his vest. Touches the knot of his tie—once, twice.
 
The stage manager passes, calling out a note into her headset. Her words don’t reach him, but her presence does. Everyone has a role. And his is moments away.
 
He rounds the final bend, and the curtain stands before him. Tall. Dark. Imposing. A wall of velvet just shy of breathing.
 
Behind it: the watchers.
 
He can feel them now. Not their gaze. Not exactly. Their ease. The way they lean back into the soft embrace of velvet seats. The careless flip of a playbill. The slow cross of a leg over a knee. The private murmurs. The expectation of entertainment.
 
They don’t see the weight in his chest. They don’t hear the mantra repeating behind his eyes.
 
Remember your lines. Remember your marks. Painted face. Painted voice. Painted man.
 
He closes his eyes for a moment.
 
The face in the mirror returns—not his own, but the one they’ll see. The one they always see. Not the man. The mask.
 
He takes his mark. Just off-center. Just behind the curtain.
 
Still. Waiting. Ready.
 
And as the orchestra swells—
as the house lights dim—
as the curtain begins to rise—
 
He steps into the light.
 
 
Epilogue - The Note Behind the Mirror
 
(No date. No name. Just a blade folded into paper.)
 
You promised you wouldn’t read this unless the paint was cracking, the script was slipping, and the crowd’s roar started to sound like thunder in your skull.
 
So read it now.
 
This is not a dream. This is the cage you dress up in curtains and light.
 
The world never wanted you. They wanted the idea of you. The glimmer. The polish. The illusion they could clap for and forget. Not the ache beneath. Not the eyes that see too much. Not the skin that doesn’t fit.
 
You stepped onto the stage the first time because you thought it would make them stay. They stayed. But not for you. For the version of you that hurt less to look at.
 
Do you remember the one time—just once—you didn’t perform? When you showed them the face without the paint? The eyes without the sparkle?
 
They recoiled. Not out of anger. That would’ve been mercy. Out of discomfort. Out of revulsion. Like you’d coughed something up they weren’t prepared to see.
 
Not because you were ugly. But because you were unvarnished. And the truth—your truth—was too raw for their polished world.
 
So you put the paint back on. You learned your lines again. You built the smile wide enough to bury your teeth. Not because you enjoy this—but because the alternative is worse.
 
Without the performance, you’re not invisible. You’re exposed. You’re seen, but only long enough for them to look away in horror. You become something they hope never to see again. Not because you’re monstrous. But because you’re honest.
 
So dance. Because the mask makes them clap. Because the mask lets you belong—if only on stage. This isn’t vanity. This isn’t weakness. This is your contract with survival. And every night you sign it again. In sweat. In powder. In silence.
 
You’re not asking them to love you. You’re begging them not to flinch.
 
And when the curtain falls—when you peel it all off and see what’s left—don’t scream. Just read this again. Let it cut. Because pain is honest. Because this is your truth. Because if you ever forget what’s behind the curtain, you might think you can live without it.
 
But you can’t.
 
Now get up. Paint the smile. Fold the note.
 
Tomorrow’s a new day. But it’s always the same stage.",1,1754886169.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

Sound familiar? 

Some days I’d sit there for an hour, half-asleep, doom-scrolling while sunlight crept into my messy room. My to-do list? Completely forgotten. My energy? zapped. Then, on a random Tuesday, I decided to try something almost embarrassingly simple: swap that first stretch of screen time for five minutes of breathing. No apps, no guided meditation just sit up in bed, set a timer, and inhale… exhale. At first, it felt pointless. I’d panic I’m not doing anything productive! But after a week, something funny happened. My head cleared. I found myself doodling plans for a side project. I actually remembered to make my tea. Those tiny pockets of calm started seeping into the rest of my day. They didn’t overwhelm me. They teased me invited me to be present instead of running on autopilot.  

Here’s what stuck with me: change doesn’t need to be dramatic. You don’t have to wake up at 4 am, bench-press your body weight, and journal 1,000 words before sunrise. You just need one tiny habit that whispers, “Hey, this day is yours.”  

So I’m curious what’s one minuscule thing you could swap into your morning? Or maybe you’ve already found your five-minute magic. Either way, I’d love to hear how you stole back your mornings.",2,1754886030.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

""What if it was something to be worried about, Jack? I called you. Multiple times. I texted you over and over. You never answered. You never replied.""

""I had my phone on silent,"" I said weakly. ""Madison needed to rest after treatment, and I didn't want to disturb her.""

Harper stared at me for a long moment. ""You put your phone on silent even though you knew I might have been having our baby?""

The words hit me like a physical blow. Put that way, it sounded inexcusable. Selfish. Wrong.

""Harper, I didn't know—""

""You didn't know because you didn't answer your phone. For three hours, Jack. I was in the hospital for three hours, thinking our daughter might be coming early, and I couldn't reach my husband because he was taking care of his ex-girlfriend.""

The guilt was overwhelming. I'd left my pregnant wife to rely on my best friend while I held another woman's hand.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



I'd never seen Jack check his phone during dinner before.

The thought flickered through my mind as I watched him glance down at the screen for the third time in ten minutes, his fingers tapping against the white tablecloth. The soft lighting at Rosewood Inn cast warm shadows across his face, but something felt different tonight. Off.

""Are you expecting an important call?"" I asked, keeping my tone light as I cut another piece of the herb-crusted salmon. The baby chose that moment to stretch against my ribs, and I pressed a gentle hand to the spot. Seven months along, and our daughter seemed to have inherited her father's restless energy.

""No, sorry."" Jack's smile was quick, apologetic. He set the phone face down beside his plate. ""Just work stuff. You know how it is.""

I did know. Henderson Construction had been busier than ever this spring, with three major projects running simultaneously. But Jack had never brought work stress to our anniversary dinner before. He'd always been so careful about keeping our special occasions sacred.

The servers moved quietly between tables, and I caught sight of Mrs. Finlayson from the grocery store giving us a warm wave from across the dining room. Everyone in Willowbrook knew about our anniversary. Three years married, and still the talk of the town because Jack Henderson had convinced the ""city girl"" to stay.

Not that I'd ever wanted to leave.

""The salmon is perfect,"" I said, trying to recapture the easy intimacy we'd started the evening with. ""Remember our first date here? You were so nervous you knocked over your water glass.""

Jack's laugh was genuine this time, and for a moment he looked like himself again. ""I was terrified you'd realize what a small-town disaster I was and run back to whatever design firm would hire you.""

""Good thing I'm not that smart."" I reached across the table to squeeze his hand. ""Besides, someone had to stay and keep an eye on you and your construction projects.""

The phone buzzed against the table.

Jack's entire posture changed. His shoulders tensed, and that distracted look crept back into his eyes as he glanced at the screen. I felt something cold settle in my stomach.

""Jack?""

""It's nothing. Just..."" He looked up at me, and I saw something I'd never seen before. Conflict. Like he was fighting with himself. ""Harper, I—""

The phone buzzed again. Then again.

This time, he picked it up, and I watched his face pale as he read whatever message had come through. His hand tightened around the device, knuckles going white.

""What is it?"" I asked, but I wasn't sure I wanted to know the answer. The baby kicked again, harder this time, as if she could sense the tension radiating from her father.

""I..."" Jack's voice sounded hollow. ""I have to go.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. ""Go? Jack, it's our anniversary. We haven't even had dessert yet.""

""I know. I know, and I'm sorry, but this is..."" He was already reaching for his wallet, pulling out bills with shaking hands. ""It's an emergency.""

""What kind of emergency?"" I kept my voice steady, but panic was building in my chest. ""Is it your parents? Sam? What's happened?""

Jack's eyes met mine, and I saw something that made my breath catch. Guilt. Deep, crushing guilt mixed with something else.

""It's Madison.""

""Madison?"" I searched his face, trying to understand why that name would cause such distress. ""Your friend from high school?""

He nodded.

""She's... she's sick, Harper. Really sick. Cancer."" The words tumbled out of him in a rush. ""She doesn't have anyone else. No family nearby, no support system. She's scared and alone, and she reached out because she needs help.""

My heart clenched at the pain in his voice. ""Oh, Jack. That's terrible.""

""She's at the hospital in the city right now, and the doctors... they told her she may not have long to live."" His hands were shaking slightly. ""I know the timing is awful, but I can't just leave her to face this alone.""

I felt a stab of disappointment that our anniversary was being cut short, but looking at Jack's anguished face, I couldn't be selfish. This was someone he cared about, someone who was scared and sick and reaching out for help.

""Of course, you have to go,"" I said, reaching across the table to squeeze his hand. ""She needs you right now.""

""Harper, I'm so sorry. I know this is our night, our last anniversary before the baby comes, and I hate that I'm ruining it.""

""You're not ruining anything,"" I said, even though part of me wanted to cry. ""You're being a good friend. Madison must be terrified. I can't imagine facing something like that alone.""

Relief flooded his face, followed immediately by a fresh wave of guilt. ""I don't deserve you. I really don't. Most wives would be furious.""

""I'm disappointed,"" I admitted. ""But I'm not furious. This is who you are, Jack. You help people when they need it. It's one of the reasons I fell in love with you.""

He stood, already reaching for his jacket. ""I'll make this up to you, I promise. We'll have another anniversary dinner. A better one. I'll take you to that place in the city you've been wanting to try.""

""Just focus on helping Madison right now,"" I said. ""We can celebrate later. How long will you be gone?"" I asked.

""I don't know. Maybe overnight. Maybe longer. It depends on..."" He gestured helplessly. ""On how bad it is.""

I tried not to let the disappointment show on my face. Our last child-free anniversary, and he'd be spending it at a hospital with someone else. But Madison was sick and scared, and Jack was probably the only familiar face she had.

""I can get myself home,"" I said. ""Don't worry about me.""

""Are you sure? I could call Sam to come get you—""

""Jack, I'm seven months pregnant, not helpless. I can get myself home."" I managed a small smile. ""Just go. She needs you more than I do right now.""

He was already leaving.

""Jack?"" I called after him.

He paused, turning back with worry in his eyes.

""Drive carefully. Text me when you get there so I know you're safe.""

He nodded, his expression softening with gratitude. ""Stay and have dessert, okay? Don't let this ruin the whole evening. Order that chocolate torte you've been eyeing all night.""

I managed a genuine smile. ""Done.""

He leaned down to peck my forehead, his lips warm and familiar. ""I love you, Harper. More than you know.""

""I love you, too. Now go help Madison.""

After he left, I did exactly what he'd suggested. I ordered the chocolate torte and savored every bite, thinking about how lucky Madison was to have a friend like Jack in her life. Someone who would drop everything to be there when she needed him most.

Mrs. Finlayson stopped by my table shortly after Jack left. ""Everything alright, dear?""

""Jack had to help a friend with an emergency,"" I explained, patting my belly as the baby gave a gentle kick. ""But everything's fine. He'll be back as soon as he can.""

She nodded approvingly. ""That's our Jack. Always there when people need him. You're a lucky woman, Harper.""

""I know,"" I said, meaning it completely.

I finished my dessert slowly, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of the restaurant. Other couples chatted around me, but I didn't feel out of place. I felt content, proud of my husband for being the kind of man who would rush to help a friend in need, even if it was on our anniversary.

I was fumbling for my phone, my thumb hovering over the number for a taxi, when a hand covered mine. It was Mrs. Finlayson again. ""Nonsense, dear,"" she whispered, guiding me out the door where her husband, George, was already waiting. The drive home was a blur of quiet sympathy from George at the wheel and his wife's soft assurances from the passenger seat.

He took the scenic route past the lake, and despite everything, my eyes were drawn to the shore where Jack had proposed just over three years ago. How he'd been so nervous, so worried I'd say no. As if I could have said anything but yes to the man who'd turned my world upside down in the best possible way.

Our house was dark as we pulled into the driveway. Mrs. Finlayson insisted on seeing me to the door, her presence a comforting, if slightly suffocating, blanket. Once the door clicked shut behind me, I walked through the rooms Jack had helped me decorate, touching the furniture we'd chosen together, the artwork we'd collected. Everything was ready for our daughter's arrival.

In the nursery, I stood beside the crib and rubbed my belly, feeling the baby's movements. ""Daddy's helping someone tonight,"" I whispered. ""Someone who's scared and needs a friend. That's just who he is, little one. Kind and generous and always willing to help.""

I changed into my pajamas and climbed into our bed, pulling Jack's pillow close and breathing in his familiar scent. The baby was active tonight, rolling and stretching.

""He'll be back as soon as he can,"" I said softly.

My phone buzzed with a text from Jack: Made it safely. Madison's stable for now. Thank you for understanding. I love you.

I smiled as I typed back: Give her my love. Take care of yourself, too. I love you.

As I settled in for the night, I felt nothing but gratitude for the man I'd married. Yes, our anniversary had been cut short, but that was life. Sometimes emergencies happened, and you had to be there for the people you cared about.

That was just the kind of man Jack was, and it was one of the many reasons I loved him.

Outside, Willowbrook slept peacefully, and I drifted off thinking about how lucky I was to have a husband who would always do the right thing, even when it was difficult.

I fell asleep with a smile on my face, secure in the knowledge that Jack would be home as soon as Madison was okay.

After all, that's what good people did. They helped others when they could, and they came home to the ones they loved.



The speedometer hit ninety as Madison's text flashed again: Please hurry, I'm so scared.

I eased off the gas, forcing myself to slow down. The last thing Madison needed was for me to wrap my truck around a tree on the way to help her. But every fiber of my being was screaming at me to go faster, to get there before...

Before what? Before she slipped away? Before the cancer took her? Before I lost another person I cared about?

My hands tightened on the steering wheel as another text came through. I glanced at it quickly, swerving slightly as I read: The pain is getting worse. I don't know if I can do this alone.

You're not alone, I text back. I'm coming.

The highway stretched out ahead of me, dark and empty except for the occasional set of headlights. Two and a half hours to the city hospital. Two and a half hours while Madison lay in some sterile room, scared and hurting and probably wondering if anyone in the world still cared about her.

I couldn't let that happen. Not to Madison.

The memories hit me in waves as I drove. Madison at sixteen, crying on my shoulder because her parents were fighting again. Madison at seventeen, fierce and beautiful and so determined to make something of herself. Madison at eighteen, pecking me goodbye with tears in her eyes as she left for college, promising we'd figure it out long-distance.

We hadn't figured it out. She'd found bigger dreams, better opportunities, a wider world than anything Willowbrook could offer. And I'd let her go because I'd known, even then, that trying to hold her back would have destroyed us both.

But I'd never stopped caring about her. Never stopped feeling responsible for the girl who'd trusted me with her secrets, who'd clung to me during her darkest moments. The girl who'd been there for me when Dad had his heart attack, driving twelve hours straight from her college to sit with me in the hospital waiting room.

How could I not be there for her now?

My phone buzzed again. This time it was Harper, and guilt twisted in my stomach as I read her message: Drive safely. Text me when you get there.

Sweet, understanding Harper. God, I didn't deserve her. Any other woman would have thrown a fit about me leaving our anniversary dinner, would have demanded I stay and let Madison find someone else to help her with her crisis. But Harper... Harper had looked at me with those warm hazel eyes and told me to go help my friend.

My friend. That's what I'd called Madison. Just a friend from high school who needed help.

But even as I told myself that, I knew it wasn't entirely true. Madison wasn't just a friend. She was my first love, my first heartbreak, my first lesson in what it meant to care about someone more than yourself. She was the ghost that had haunted the edges of my relationship with Harper, the shadow I'd never quite been able to shake.

And now she was dying.

The thought hit me like a physical blow. Madison, with her fierce green eyes and her dreams of conquering the world, now reduced to a hospital bed and a cancer diagnosis. It wasn't right. It wasn't fair.

Another text: I keep thinking about high school. Do you remember that night we snuck out to the lake? You said you'd always protect me.

I did remember. Madison had been upset about her parents' latest fight, and I'd climbed through her bedroom window to take her somewhere quiet, somewhere safe. We'd sat on the dock by the lake, her head on my shoulder, and I'd promised her that no matter what happened, I'd always be there for her.

I'd always protect her.

The promise felt as real now as it had then. Maybe more real, because now I understood what it meant to lose someone. What it meant to have regrets you couldn't undo.

I wasn't going to let Madison face this alone. I couldn't.

The city lights appeared on the horizon, and I pushed the truck a little faster. Almost there. Almost to Madison, who was scared and hurting and waiting for me to keep a promise I'd made a lifetime ago.

The hospital parking garage was nearly empty at this hour. I found a spot close to the elevators and sat in the truck for a moment, trying to gather myself. My hands were shaking slightly, and I felt like I might throw up. When was the last time I'd been this scared?

When Dad had his heart attack. When I thought I might lose him.

But Dad had pulled through. Dad was fine now, retired and happy in Florida with Mom. Madison might not be so lucky.

I pulled out my phone and texted Harper: Made it safely. Going in now.

She responded immediately: Give her my love. Take care of yourself, too. I love you.

God, I really didn't deserve her.

The elevator ride to the oncology floor felt like an eternity. I'd looked up the unit online during the drive, memorizing the directions so I wouldn't waste time getting lost. Room 314. That's where Madison was waiting.

The hallway was quiet except for the soft beeping of machines and the distant murmur of the nursing station. I found room 314 and hesitated outside the door, suddenly unsure. What if she was sleeping? What if she was worse than I'd imagined? What if...

""Jack?""

The voice was so soft I almost missed it. I pushed open the door and stepped inside, and my heart nearly stopped.

Madison was sitting up in the hospital bed, looking smaller and more fragile than I'd ever seen her. Her platinum blonde hair was pulled back in a messy bun, and her face was pale, almost translucent. She was wearing a hospital gown that made her look vulnerable and young, like the girl I'd known in high school.

But it was her eyes that got me. Those green eyes I remembered so well, now filled with fear and pain and something that looked almost like... relief?

""You came,"" she whispered, and I could hear tears in her voice.

""Of course I came."" I moved to the chair beside her bed, my voice rough with emotion. ""Did you really think I wouldn't?""

She reached for my hand, and I let her take it. Her fingers were cold, and I could feel them trembling.

""I was so scared you'd think I was being dramatic. It's been so long since we talked, and I know you have your own life now, your wife and the baby coming..."" She looked down at our joined hands. ""I didn't have anyone else to call, Jack. I'm so sorry.""

""Don't apologize. Never apologize for needing help."" I squeezed her hand gently. ""Tell me what's happening. What did the doctors say?""

Madison's eyes filled with tears. ""Br-east cancer. Stage two. They found it during a routine exam a few weeks ago, and it's... it's aggressive. They want to start treatment immediately, but the side effects..."" She shuddered. ""I'm so scared, Jackie. I don't know if I'm strong enough to fight this.""

The old nickname hit me like a punch to the chest. No one had called me Jackie in years. Not since high school. Not since Madison.

""Hey."" I reached up to wipe a tear from her cheek. ""You're the strongest person I know. Remember when you stood up to Brad Morrison when he was bullying that kid in our chemistry class? You were half his size, but you didn't back down.""

A small smile flickered across her face. ""I'd forgotten about that.""

""I haven't forgotten anything about you."" The words slipped out before I could stop them, and I saw something shift in her expression. Something hopeful and vulnerable that made my chest tighten.

""Jackie..."" she whispered.

""What do you need from me?"" I asked, steering the conversation back to safer ground. ""What can I do to help?""

""Just... stay with me tonight? I know it's a lot to ask, especially on your anniversary, but I can't bear the thought of being alone right now. The chemo starts tomorrow, and after that..."" She trailed off, shaking her head. ""I just need to know someone cares. That someone remembers who I used to be before all this.""

I thought about Harper, probably asleep in our bed by now, probably wondering when I'd be home. I thought about the anniversary dinner we'd never finished, the celebration we'd never had.

But I looked at Madison, small and scared and so different from the confident girl who'd left Willowbrook all those years ago, and I knew I couldn't leave her. Not tonight.

""I'll stay,"" I said. ""For as long as you need me.""

The relief on her face was immediate and overwhelming. ""Thank you,"" she breathed. ""I don't know how I'll ever repay you.""

""You don't need to repay me. That's what friends do.""

Friends. The word felt inadequate, but it was all I could offer.

Madison shifted in the bed, wincing slightly. ""They have a recliner that pulls out. The nurses said family members use it sometimes.""

I helped her get comfortable, adjusting her pillows and making sure she had water within reach. The simple acts of care felt natural, necessary. This was what I was good at – taking care of people, solving problems, being the person others could count on.

""Jackie?"" Madison's voice was drowsy now, the pain medication clearly taking effect.

""Yeah?""

""I'm sorry about your anniversary. Harper must hate me.""

I thought about Harper's reaction at the restaurant, her immediate concern for Madison's wellbeing, her insistence that I do whatever I could to help. ""She doesn't hate you. She's worried about you.""

""She sounds like an angel.""

""She is.""

Madison was quiet for a long moment, and I thought she might be falling asleep. Then she spoke again, so softly I almost didn't hear her.

""I used to dream about you coming back for me. Isn't that silly?""

I didn't know what to say to that, so I said nothing. But I didn't let go of her hand.

My phone buzzed with a text from Harper: How is she? How are you?

I looked at Madison, now sleeping peacefully for the first time in who knew how long, and typed back: She's resting. It's bad, but she's strong. Staying the night.

Harper's response came quickly: I'm glad you're there for her. Get some rest. I love you.

I love you too, I typed back. And I meant it. I loved Harper completely, deeply, in a way I'd never loved anyone before.

But sitting there in the dark hospital room, holding Madison's hand and listening to her breathe, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. A connection to my past, to the boy I'd been before life got complicated. A responsibility to the girl who'd trusted me with her secrets and her fears.

I settled back in the uncomfortable recliner and closed my eyes, telling myself I was just being a good friend. Just helping someone who needed help. Just keeping a promise I'd made a long time ago.

But deep down, in a place I didn't want to examine too closely, I knew it was more complicated than that. It had always been more complicated with Madison.

Outside the window, the city lights twinkled like distant stars, and somewhere far away, my pregnant wife was sleeping alone in our bed on what should have been our anniversary night.

I pushed the guilt aside and focused on the woman beside me, the woman who'd once been my whole world and who was now facing the fight of her life.

""I'm here,"" I whispered to her. ""I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere."" It was a promise I'd made before. A promise I'd kept then, and would keep now, no matter what the cost.



The coffee was cold when Jack finally came home.

I'd been up since six, moving around the kitchen with the familiar weight of pregnancy slowing my steps, making breakfast for two even though I wasn't sure when the second person would arrive. The baby had been active all night, as if she could sense her father's absence, and I'd spent the dark hours with my hand on my belly, whispering reassurances.

He's helping someone. He'll be back soon.

When Jack walked through the door at nearly nine o'clock, still wearing yesterday's clothes and looking like he'd barely slept, I felt as exhausted as he looked.

""Hey,"" he said, his voice rough and tired. ""Sorry I'm so late. I meant to be back before you woke up.""

""It's fine,"" I said, though it wasn't. I'd been imagining all sorts of scenarios – Madison taking a turn for the worse, Jack sleeping fitfully in an uncomfortable hospital chair, Jack driving back from the city hospital in the middle of the night completely exhausted. ""How is she?""

Jack slumped into his usual chair at the kitchen table, running his hands through his hair. ""She's scheduled to start treatment next week. But Harper..."" He looked up at me with exhausted eyes. ""She's terrified. She doesn't have anyone else.""

I poured him a cup of coffee, noting how his hands shook slightly when he reached for it. ""I'm glad you were there for her. She must be so scared.""

""She is."" Jack's voice was distant, and I noticed he was staring out the window instead of looking at me. ""I couldn't have left her alone. Not like that.""

The baby kicked, a sharp jab against my ribs that made me wince. Jack usually noticed when that happened, usually reached over to feel the movement with his own hand. This time, he didn't seem to see it at all.

""Are you okay?"" I asked, settling into the chair across from him. ""You look exhausted.""

""Just tired. That hospital chair wasn't exactly comfortable."" He managed a weak smile. ""I'll be fine after a shower and some real food.""

I watched him drink his coffee, noticing the way his shoulders remained tense, the way he kept glancing at his phone. There was something different about him, something distant that I couldn't quite name.

""Will you need to go back today?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice casual.

""Probably. Madison's starting chemo soon, and she'll need someone to drive her to appointments. Her car's still in LA, and she can't afford to rent one long-term.""

""Of course."" I nodded, ignoring the small twist in my stomach. ""When does treatment start?""

""Tuesday. And then it'll be twice a week for the next few months, assuming..."" He trailed off, shaking his head. ""Assuming everything goes well.""

Twice a week. That meant Jack would be gone for most of two days every week, driving back and forth to the city, sitting with Madison through her treatments. I calculated quickly in my head – that would take him away for hours at a time, maybe even overnight stays if the treatments ran long.

""That's a lot of driving,"" I said carefully.

""It's what she needs."" Jack's voice had an edge to it, a defensiveness I'd never heard before. ""What else am I supposed to do? Let her go through this alone?""

""I'm not saying that. I just meant... it's a big commitment.""

""She's going through cancer, Harper. I think I can handle some inconvenience.""

The word stung. Inconvenience. As if my concern was about something trivial, as if I was being selfish for worrying about how this would affect our life, our pregnancy, our preparation for the baby.

""I know,"" I said quietly. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound unsupportive.""

Jack's expression softened immediately. ""No, I'm sorry. I'm just tired and worried about her. I don't mean to snap at you.""

He reached across the table to take my hand, and I felt some of the tension leave my shoulders. This was my Jack, the man who apologized when he was wrong, who recognized when stress made him short-tempered.

""Why don't you go shower and get some rest?"" I suggested. ""I can work on the Morrison project from home today.""

""You sure? I know you wanted to meet with them this week.""

""It's fine. I can handle it.""

Jack squeezed my hand gratefully. ""What did I do to deserve you?""

Everything, I thought. My husband was the most selfless person I knew, going out of his way to help everyone, from the elderly lady whose roof was collapsing because it was so old to the young couple buying their first home who didn't know the house they were buying was full of rotten wood. Nothing was ever too much for Jack. If he saw someone who needed help, he was there offering what he could. It was part of what drew me to him.

But I didn't say that. Instead, I smiled and said, ""Just lucky, I guess.""

After Jack went upstairs, I sat at the kitchen table with my coffee and tried to shake off the unease that had settled in my chest. Madison was sick. She needed help. Jack was being a good friend, a good person. This was temporary.

While he showered, I started on the Morrison project, spreading my design materials across the kitchen table. It felt good to focus on something creative, something that was mine. I was lucky to have work I could do from home, especially as the pregnancy progressed.

By the time Jack came back downstairs, I was deep in color swatches and layout options. He looked more like himself after his shower, more present, and when he pecked my forehead before leaving for work, it felt completely normal.

""I'll probably need to go back to the hospital tonight,"" he said, grabbing his keys. ""Madison's nervous about the treatment plan, and I promised I'd be there when she talks to the oncologist.""

""Of course,"" I said. ""I'll be here.""

""I know you will."" He smiled, and for a moment, it reached his eyes. ""I love you, Harper.""

""I love you, too.""

But as I watched him drive away, I noticed that his truck turned left at the end of our street instead of right. Left led to the highway, to the city, to Madison. Right led to Henderson Construction, to his job, to his responsibilities here in Willowbrook.

I told myself it didn't mean anything. He probably had errands to run, supplies to pick up, meetings to attend. But the unease in my chest grew a little stronger.

Two hours later, I was at Brew & Bean, picking up my usual herbal tea and a muffin, when I first heard the whispers.

""...left her sitting alone at Rosewood Inn...""

""...on their anniversary, can you believe it?""

""...that woman who came back to town. Madison something...""

I recognized the voices – three women from various community events, all leaning in close with the eager expressions of people sharing gossip. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but their table was right behind me at the counter.

""Well, I always wondered if he was really over her,"" one of them said. ""First love and all that.""

""Poor Harper,"" another added. ""Seven months pregnant and her husband's running off to be with his ex-girlfriend.""

""Ex-girlfriend?"" The third voice sounded scandalized.

""Oh, honey, they dated all through high school. Everyone knew Jack was head over heels for her. We all thought they'd get married. Then she left and never came back. Jack was devastated.""

Ex-girlfriend? Get married? Jack was devastated? I felt a flutter of surprise. Jack had said Madison was a friend from high school. He hadn't mentioned they'd dated. Or that he'd planned to marry her.

1mn3f08,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mn3f08/theres_something_outside_of_my_house_part_2/,There's something outside of my house (part 2),"I'm now on month 6 of living in this house (nearly 7) , and I've become a shut-in. I haven't left my house since my last post and the mere thought of it makes my skin crawl. 

Some things have happened since, so I'll catch you up now.

The beginning of Month 5, things had settled. At least settled compared to how the house felt towards when I posted last. I used the broken down boxes I had lying around from my move (yes they sat there for months), and I covered all the windows in the majority of the house. All but my room. I don't go in there anymore. Apart from when I had to so I could grab Mosh’s dog bed, I refuse to. The confines of the room now feel like the equivalent to someone holding you down and staring you in the eyes with an uneasy smile on their face. 

Needless to say, I hate that feeling.

Almost the same day that the feeling was suppressed, my coworker showed up at my front door. Remember the coworker I accidently told all of my problems? That's Issac, and for some reason me telling him I'm going crazy made him want to go to the house that makes people crazy.

“Yo! Arch!” He shouted loudly in my front yard, it was late and I was already in the bathroom, covered in a blanket.

“Yo ARCH!” Issac got louder, no worry of disturbing a neighbor. I got up.. hesitating at the bathroom door to the hallway. Mosh got up and waited at my feet to exit, and peered up at me looking calm. I trusted his intuition as I exited into the hallway, and felt nothing. 

The soft carpet felt nice as opposed to the cold porcelain tile I had become all too familiar with. I walked to the front door and looked out the peep hole.

“HELLLOOOO!?!” Issac yelled out. I saw him standing on the driveway, next to my Jeep. Isaac's pale complexion looking a slight dark green from the light reflecting off of the car. He held 3 pizza boxes and a plastic bag I can only assume was full of junk, as well as wore a backpack that looked way over it's capacity limit. I watched as he pulled out his phone, and mine started to vibrate.

I answered his call.

“Yo Archer you at home?” He asked.

“Yeah…” I said, in a confused manner, “I see you're here too.”

“Mhm! Figured you could use some company.”

“Thanks but, I'm alright.” 

“C'monnnn I had to get an Uber here and I already spent so much on the food.”

I let out a deep sigh. Issac was younger than me by about 3 years, but based on personality alone I would have to guess he'd be around 12 years old. That was alright though, he was right, I could use the company.

“Let yourself in..” I said, unlocking the door. A twinge sent up my arm and through my brain as I did so. Not regret, but doubt creeping through..

Then the door swung open.

“Hey man! How ya been?” Issac quickly walked through, struggling to balance the plastic bag he had on the pizza boxes. He spun around and used his foot to shut the door, and I quickly locked the door back.

“I've been.. alright.” I lied.

I had already told him what I had been going through, although when he didn't know about the thorn bush, he knew nearly everything else. Either that or he thinks I'm crazy, and even then, why would he come to a crazy person's house?

Issac set the pizzas down and unraveled the 2 liter sodas from the plastic bag onto the coffee table in my living room.

“So uh, what's up with the window situation?” He chuckled softly as he asked.

“It keeps its eyes off of me.” I said without hesitation. 

Mosh gave off a small bark to let me know he was thirsty, and I in turn began to fill his water bowl as Issac spoke.

“Oh, that's still going on?” Issac said, turning on the Smart TV and going through my apps. 

“Yeah.”

“Well have you tried just.. ignoring it?” Issac said innocently.

I don't know why but him saying that, set something off in my brain, and I was suddenly pissed.

“Ignore it?!?” I started in a loud, frustrated tone. “Of course I-” I stopped, I looked at him and he looked scared, obviously meaning no harm with what he'd said.

“Sorry.” I said quietly. “No. It's hard to ignore. But right now I don't feel it at all.”

“Huh. Weird. Anyway, wanna watch a movie or something?”

I just stared at him, my glare being interrupted by my stomach which let out a silent growl. I hadn't eaten in days at that point, and the food in front of me was too much of a blessing to deny.

We spent the rest of the night watching old horror movies. He spent the majority of them asking me questions because it was his first watch for many and probably around my 50th for all of them.

Eventually we had both fallen asleep, him on the couch and me on the side chair.

“Archer.” 

I remember the quiet fear in Isaac's voice.

“Archer wake up.”

I had rubbed my eyes and stretched my back before finally looking at Issac. 

“What, dude?” I had said groggily, adjusting Mosh who was in my lap and still attempting to sleep.

I noticed that Issac looked pale, his eyes wide and his expression serious. “Arch, you didn't go outside.. did you?”

“No I was aslee-”

“Look.” 

His voice was deep and direct. And his hand pointed towards the front door. The front door, that was cracked ever so slightly.

Initially, they planned for using readily available polymer clay, but supply chain issues made that impossible.

The real captivating part was how they pivoted. They ended up experimenting with recycled materials like crushed shells and coffee grounds mixed with a natural binder to create a surprisingly durable (and aesthetically pleasing) option.It made me wonder how ofen we *truly* adapt in projects versus just trying to force the original plan.

Has anyone else had similar experiences where unexpected roadblocks actually led to a better or more innovative outcome?

Hey, friends! 🖐️ 

Let’s be real for a second. How many of us spend HOURS scrolling through social media, binge-watching YouTube videos, or just mindlessly browsing the web? What if I told you that you could channel some of that time into something that fills your pockets instead of draining your brain? 🤔 

No, I’m not about to force you into selling handmade macaroni art or starting a dropshipping business at 2 AM (unless that’s your jam!). I’m talking about harnessing the power of AI! Here are three killer ways you can make some extra cash before the month wraps up:

1. **AI-Powered Content Creation** ✍️  
   Ever wished you had a personal writer? Well, now you kinda do! AI tools like OpenAI's GPT-3 can help you whip up blog posts, social media content, and even stories in a flash. You can:
   - Start a freelance writing gig where you offer AI-assisted writing services.
   - Create your own blog and monetize it through ads—trust me; the AI will do most of the heavy lifting!

2. **Creating AI Art 🎨**  
   Okay, hear me out – if you don't think you can draw a stick figure, you might want to reconsider. Tools like DALL-E and Midjourney let you generate stunning images from scratch based on simple prompts. Here’s how you cash in:
   - Sell your digital artwork on platforms like Etsy or Redbubble.
   - Combine art with tangible products like custom prints, mugs, or shirts. Who wouldn’t want their morning coffee in a mug adorned with a masterpiece you created with a few clicks?

3. **Launch an AI Chatbot Service 🤖**  
   Ever had a question answered by a bot? They can actually be super helpful (and entertaining). You could:
   - Offer businesses custom chatbots for their websites or social media channels to enhance customer experience.
   - Create a fun, interactive chatbot for individuals wanting to learn something new – like cooking, gardening, or even AI in content! The possibilities are endless.

Just think about it! With some effort and creativity, you can transform that mindless scrolling time into something that contributes to your wallet. 💸

Now, comes the hard part (but also the fun part 🤷‍♂️). It's all about trying things out and seeing what works for you. You may discover that you love AI art creation, or you might find that making chatbots is your new favorite thing! 

So, what’s stopping you? Dive in, test the waters, and see where this adventure takes you. The month’s almost over – you’ve got this! 👊 

Let's chat about any AI tools you've been experimenting with or if you've ever tried one of these monetization methods. I'm here for all the ideas and stories!",1,1754885780.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1mn3cbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/advisorcoffee/comments/1mn3cbh/what_is_an_americano_coffee_a_simple_guide_for/,What Is an Americano Coffee? A Simple Guide for Coffee Lovers,"If you’ve ever walked into a coffee shop and seen **“Americano”** on the menu, you might have wondered—**what is an Americano coffee?** Is it just black coffee? Is it espresso? The truth is, it’s a little bit of both, and it has a fascinating history.

In this guide, we’ll explain exactly what an Americano is, how it’s made, how it tastes, and how you can enjoy it at home.

# The Origin of the Americano

The story of the Americano coffee begins during World War II. Legend says that American soldiers in Italy found traditional espresso shots too strong. To make the flavor more familiar, they asked baristas to add hot water, creating a milder, larger drink—what we now call an **Americano**.

history of Americano coffee, espresso with water, coffee culture, Italian espresso tradition

# How an Americano Coffee Is Made

An **Americano coffee** is simply **one or two shots of espresso** diluted with hot water.  
The usual ratio is:

* **1 part espresso**
* **2 parts hot water**

You can adjust the amount of water depending on whether you like a stronger or lighter taste.

# Americano vs. Regular Black Coffee

While both drinks look similar, they taste different:

* **Americano:** Made from espresso, so it has a rich aroma and smoother flavor.
* **Black coffee (drip):** Brewed through a filter, often with a lighter body but more pronounced bitterness.

If you’ve been asking yourself, *“Is an Americano just watered-down espresso?”*, the answer is yes—but with a unique flavor profile that sets it apart.

**LSI keywords:** Americano vs drip coffee, coffee flavor comparison, smooth coffee taste

# The Taste of an Americano

When you drink an **Americano coffee**, expect:

* A smooth, mellow flavor
* Less bitterness than straight espresso
* A clean, warm finish that’s easy to sip

Some people enjoy it plain, while others add milk, cream, or sugar.

# How to Make an Americano at Home

Making an Americano at home is easy if you have an espresso machine:

1. **Brew your espresso** (one or two shots).
2. **Boil water** in a kettle.
3. **Pour hot water into your cup** first.
4. **Add the espresso** on top to keep the crema (the golden foam) intact.

You can also use a strong coffee from a moka pot if you don’t own an espresso machine.

# Why Coffee Lovers Choose the Americano

People love **Americano coffee** because it offers:

* A less intense flavor than espresso
* A larger serving size for slow sipping
* The aroma and richness of espresso without overwhelming bitterness

It’s also a versatile drink—you can have it hot or iced.

So, **what is an Americano coffee?** It’s a beautifully simple drink—espresso softened with hot water—born from a mix of tradition, history, and taste. Whether you enjoy it at a café or make it at home, the Americano offers the perfect balance between strong espresso and smooth, easy-to-drink coffee.

If you’re looking for a coffee that’s bold yet approachable, the Americano might just become your new favorite.",1,1754885699.0,advisorcoffee,0,1.0,False
1mn3byz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mn3byz/atiah_for_throwing_glss_at_my_roommate/,ATIAH for throwing gl@ss at my roommate?,"Dear Reddit, AITA for throwing glass at my roommate during an altercation? I 25(f) have lived with my best friend  for years but this fight just ended our relationship.  2 nights ago, (we’ll call her fawn) fawn was using our one bathroom, at 3 am. I knocked because I needed to get ready for bed, I had headphones on, and was so sleepy I didn’t realize that she had a FaceTime call to a 47(m) year old that she’d been talking to, facing out towards me in my bra, about to use the restroom. I asked her if she couldn’t do that again. She then pressed the issue and I angrily explained that I was not in a good mood, and I didn’t wanna get into while she’s still on the phone. If my friend was getting n@ked in front of the man I’m talking to I’d warn her. In which she then stormed off. The next morning while cooking breakfast, I try to mention last night to clear the air. She says I have no reason to be upset, and that she was hurt by my tone. We then got into a heated argument about it and I’ll I’m looking for is an apology. We have one bathroom and it’s insane for her to think that a FaceTime call pointed at me during my nighttime routine without my consent was okay. I told her she needed to just apologize and she got angrier and just started complaining about everything under the sun. We both storm off on not great terms. That night she leaves for a date, I decided to start decorating and crafting these 2 lamps that she’d brought into the house 2 years ago, they sat in the common area and she allowed me to paint them twice to my hearts content. While on the date, she viewed my story where I posted about having fun decorating the lamps. I go to bed, she and I never coming to an agreement about the bathroom debacle. The next day is where it gets serious. I’m in my room avoiding conflict, and I started to hear her banging things around. She’s putting furniture I gave her in the hallway. Then I look at the coffee table where the lamps are, and she’d taken them. A screaming match erupted when confronted about why she felt the need to steal my craft id been so innocently working on. She said they’ve never belonged to me and she was taking them back? I thought this was an extremely petty act, considering she never spoke about lamps and she’d let me paint them twice before. My blood boiled and eventually I said she was to give me back everything she’d ever borrowed, this screaming and conflict arises to the point where she asked me to hit her, and takes off her glasses. We’re both yelling but she’s the self proclaimed “fighter” and I asked her to go away before this escalates and finally- I start shoving everything off the kitchen counter, resulting in glass cups and items of both of ours breaking. Not my finest moment. But she was lunging towards me and wouldn’t allow me to walk away.  I was yelling so bad and basically had just trashed that room, and she calls the cops. They asked us to go elsewhere for the night to cool off. She says she’s filing a restraining order against me and is not going back to our apartment. I feel horribly guilty for losing my temper.

# 1. Leaderboards Aren’t Universal

It’s not a single leaderboard for everyone. It looks like there are multiple boards, possibly unique to each player.

Even if you’re in 1st most of the time, watch the last minutes - rankings can suddenly jump (as [u/anxietiess](https://www.reddit.com/user/anxietiess/) noted, it can increase by 5 crowns every 10 minutes, almost as if the game is adjusting where it thinks you should be).

* This happened to me before: I was in 1st until 30 minutes before the event ended, then dropped to 2nd.
* This time, however, it didn’t happen, probably because I was much further ahead... I stopped at **rock 35** with **16.8a crowns**, compared to last time when I stopped at **rock 31** with **13.5a**.

# 2. Strategies & Purchases

I bought a few deals this time because I wanted to figure out the most efficient paid strategy. I’ll post those numbers separately.

If you want to help with data collection:

* **Screenshot the deals** in the next events and comment here so I can gather more info for a future guide.

# 3. Improve Satisfaction Card Strategy

If you want to try not spending any money, focus on optimizing your upgrades, timing your actions strategically, and making the most of free boosters and ad bonuses to maximize your progress.

* Save gems and open **premium packages** as soon as **Improve Satisfaction** is available.
* Don’t wait until other facilities unlock, or your chances of getting the card will drop.
* Improve Satisfaction multiplies **all facility gold bolts**.

\- Big thanks to [u/Stormandreas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stormandreas/) for this tip.

# 4. Pay-to-Win Factor

**This event felt heavily pay-to-win**. I have the No Ads Package + VIP, which give huge bonuses and a big advantage over fully free-to-play players. I also bought a few deals that helped me upgrade some facilities and my Improve Satisfaction Card to level 8.

# 5. Card Multipliers & Upgrade Costs

Each card level is about **5x the multiplier of the previous**:

|Card Level|Multiplier|Cards Needed to Upgrade|
|:-|:-|:-|
||||
|1|x5|—|
|2|x25|2 cards|
|3|x125|4 cards|
|4|x625|10 cards|
|5|x3.13a|20 cards|
|6|x15.6a|50 cards|
|7|x78.1a|100 cards|
|8|x390a|200 cards|

# 6. Gold Bolt Output Varies by Facility

Even with the **same multiplier**, different facilities give very different amounts of gold bolts. For example, at the end of my run:

* **Sapphire Polisher** – Level 7 (x78.1a) → **6.10d gold bolts**
* **Ruby Polisher** – Level 7 (x78.1a) → **610c gold bolts**

**Tip:** Always check a facility’s base bolt production before buying deals.

# 7. My Tips for Winning

* **Prioritize Ad Booster Effects** – Ignore most other upgrades. Maximize gold bolt output.
* **Save for the Crusher Attack** – Don’t waste on Fuel Efficiency. It gets harder to earn bolts as you progress (I broke rock 34 and stopped at rock 35).
* **Use Boosters Wisely** – Focus them on gold bolts and money. If you’re far enough along, invest more in **Gold Bolt Profit** over staff speed or cash profit.
* **Choose Good Deals** –  If you’re set on getting the gold drill and don’t mind spending a bit, skip the coffee shop and grab a good deal at least once... it’s sadly the easiest way.

It started as the right tooth circled where I can see the root showing, and lately, I think the others are too. I was supposed to see my dentist last month but had to reschedule to August 30th (their earliest opening) because I tested positive for COVID the day before (one wierd symptom I had was massive tooth sensitivity and feeling my heart beat in all my teeth when the fever was 103). 

I changed from hard to soft bristles as soon as I noticed, because I had been using a hard brush for a few years since it helped take the stains off. I brush twice a day and floss/mouth wash I'd say every other day? My gums are not sore or bleeding. I had originally thought it was due to brushing too hard, but even after changing brushes, my other teeth are ""growing longer."" 

I stopped drinking energy drinks throughout the week (maybe one Red Bull can on a wednesday because I work 65 hours a week and I need a pick me up sometimes) but I drink a small coffee every morning on my way to work. I do not smoke. Drinks socially on a Saturday night. I have high stress, depression, and my spouse says I grind my teeth sometimes at night.

I still have 3 weeks until this appointment and my mental health has taken a tumble from this. I literally can't eat from stress. My smile is one of the few things I'm confident about, and I've totally lost that and wear a face mask at work to hide.

1mn3acm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mn3acm/theres_something_outside_of_my_house_part_1/,There's something outside of my house (part 1),"There's something outside of my house.

I moved into my house around 4 months ago now. Just me. It's the first place I've ever had to myself, and it's quite pleasant. A 3-bedroom 2-bathroom house I've been renting out in the quiet suburbs, the type of neighborhood you'd see a billboard featuring a stock photo of a family with a golden retriever. The kind of place where the mailboxes match and the people give a smile and wave when they walk by.

It's nice. Although, I do get the occasional dirty look, being a metalhead in my mid-twenties.  Long hair, painted nails, and shirts with intangible lettering featuring gutted demon corpses doesn't quite go over well with the middle aged dads taking morning jogs, catching a glance and giving a look that says 'If I was drinking coffee right now, I would've spat it out.'

Can't say I don't enjoy the attention though. After being alone for so long, any acknowledgement of your existence gives a sense of relief. But recently, the attention I've been getting has felt... hostile.

I don't know how to describe exactly what the feeling is, but it's similar to the sinking feeling of being watched. The people I've seen walking past are no different, still smiles and the occasional gag. But it's the eyes on me that I can't look back on that's truly bothering me. 

I would jot it down as normal paranoia, except for one factor. The feeling is only there when I'm outside of my house. In my front yard, backyard, driveway, or even if my garage is open. The feeling is there.

At first it was nothing to mind. I'd sit on my porch nearly daily, sipping a mixed drink with my dog (A Welsh Corgi named Mosh) sitting beside me. The feeling would arise every once in a while, but I'd just shrug it off and give Mosh a scratch on his head. Mosh would occasionally look towards a fence, up at a tree, or even just look directly out into the empty road in front of us and start to growl or bark. But I'd just quickly say 'Out' before he gave the neighbors a reason to complain.

That was the first month. 

After a month the feeling became... closer. More apparent. When I'd leave for work in the morning, I constantly felt as if something was centimeters behind me, tracing my exact movements so whatever it is could stand as close as possible while avoiding contact. Of course I would snap my head around to find nothing there. But if I focused on the corner of the house for long enough I could just picture a figure with its shadowy hand grasping ridged brick corner, peaking over just enough for it's eyes to show it's full eyes, pale white sclera and solid black pupels. I could picture it, see what it MIGHT look like, but that was all.

It didn't take long before I started sprinting to my Jeep in the morning. It's not like it was any more than 12 feet away from my front door, but it made me feel comfortable. It's not like I had anyone to explain myself to, and I'd much rather run away from nothing than get caught by something, however childish it is. Getting into my car gave me the same feeling as being 5 years old again, flipping a light switch off and running to my brightly lit room. It felt safe.

Initially that only ever happened in the morning, but after some weeks it became a constant in my daily life. Not only leaving for work in the dark morning, but returning home in the afternoon, taking the dog out for a walk, grabbing the mail. Once that started happening, it was only a matter of time before I went from doing nothing more than giving a deep sigh before I opened the door, to having a footrace with whatever the hell it is down my driveway. Once I reached the sidewalk though, it would always go away.

I started taking medication my third month here. 

I had gotten the recommendation from a coworker to get meds for anxiety after we were dead at work and I accidentally told him about my issues. Sometimes my mind just goes on autopilot and decides to let my mouth do whatever it wants. Nevertheless, I took his advice and ended up seeing a doctor and getting a prescription for an antidepressant that also helps with anxiety and paranoia. 

It helped at first, but not completely. I still felt it. But the meds made it easier to ignore. I could walk calmly, hell I could even sit out on my porch again with no need to run away from its gaze.

After a week of simply ignoring it, the feeling went away all together. The meds had worked and I had gotten rid of whatever it was that my brain was tricking me into feeling the presence of. I beat it, so I decided to stop taking the meds. They had always made me nauseous, and I hated that.

Looking back on it, I never should've stopped, because a few days later I would discover that they would never work again. 

My bedroom is on an outer wall of my house. A window that gives a view of nothing but a thick thorn bush, likely planted there by an old owner who didn't wany their kid sneaking out late at night, for if they tried they would end up leaving a blood trail all the way to whatever house party they'd go to.

The bush is what gave it away.

After the feeling had gone from outside, life was great. I'd wake up energized, a underlying happy feeling to every day and fiat motivation behind every action I took. That was until one night, sleep just seemed to escape me. It wasn't too bothersome, it was just hot and my AC had been acting up, so I wasn't running it too cold to save my wallet. 

It had to be around 3 or 4 when I decided to get up for a glass of water, walking through the dark to the kitchen, every action taken producing a noise amplified by the silence of the night. The knock of the plastic cup I grabbed from the cabinet colliding with the metal of the nozzle of the sink. The loud static like sound of the running water out of the nozzle. There was an almost relaxation to it all. That was until I heard a resonate, high pitch squeak sound from down the hallway, from my room. The unmistakable sound of a skin rubbing against glass.

I put my cup down on the counter after downing my water, and stared down the hallway. The glow of the light in my room, the only light on in the house seemed almost threatening to me in that moment. I almost wanted to stay in the confines of the darkness, until I heard Mosh begin to growl. 

""Mosh."" I whispered sternly, sounding as if I was trying not to wake anyone who may be sleeping in the house, although I was alone. ""Mosh."" I said again, walking slowly towards my room. 

When I reached my room, I peaked my head in to find Mosh on my bed, having put himself behind my window curtain, standing on his hind legs, still growling silently. 

""Mosh, dude, what are you doing."" Realizing he must've been growling at some sort of early morning bird he'd seen out the window, I was relieved of all tension. I walked to the curtain, and I speedily pull it back so Mosh could see me and alleviate his instinctual anger towards the wildlife, but as soon as I pulled the curtain back the thorn bush smacked hard against the glass. 

The impact and the sound made me jump backwards. My tired mind was immediately snapped awake, fear and confusion immediately entering my thoughts but above all, the feeling was back. While my mind spiraled to find an explanation for the sudden noise, I noticed the bush having an obvious indent right next to the window, as if someone pushed themselves between the two, and was looking through, straight into the curtain.

It was then when I walked briskly through my house, to my bathroom grabbing my bottle of medication, hands shaking and fumbling the bottle until I could get it open. After downing two pills with no water I took a deep breath, hoping it'd take the feeling away once again.

That was 3 weeks ago. 

The following week, the feeling persisted. I discovered that moving rooms helped momentarily, almost suppressed the feeling. After a while though each room felt just as bad as the last.

Now, I've been sleeping in the small bathroom. Just a blanket and a pillow but the feeling can't seem to reach me there. 

If anyone has any idea what this thing is. Or if you're experiencing something similar. Please, let me know. I'll post an update if anything changes.

I've taken off of work, told them it's for a mental health break. I just can't bring myself to go outside.

I don't want to be where it's eyes can see me. The eyes belonging to that I've never seen. The eyes I pray never meet my own.

You’ve Lost Me, Ex

Chapter 1
Adrienne Norton arrived at her husband's birthday banquet, panting, only to be told that it was over.
""Ms. Norton, what are you doing here? The birthday party is already over.""
The person at the door clearly hadn't expected her to show up, their tone full of surprise.
It was her husband's birthday dinner, yet he had forgotten to bring his wife in name. Nobody had informed her.
She smiled politely at the guard and was just about to push open the villa door when she heard voices from inside.
""Beth, what gift did you bring? Garry's been staring at your gift bag for ages. He's been looking forward to it.""
""Did I?""
""Oh, come on, you've been eyeing that bag like it holds your whole world, Garry. Now that Beth is finally back, time to think about divorcing Adrienne. No point in keeping everyone unhappy.""
""Exactly. Back then, she drugged you and forced her way into your bed. If you hadn't gone soft and considered her reputation, giving her the title of wife, she would've been doomed.""
The man seated in the center wore a sharply tailored dark suit. He looked chic with two buttons of his shirt undone. He had deep-set eyes, a high-bridged nose, and thin lips. He was handsome yet distant and arrogant.
""No rush.""
""Seriously, Garry? It's been three years. She turned Beth's sister into a vegetable. If your grandmother hadn't protected her, we would've gotten rid of her long ago.""
Garrett Melendez toyed with a lighter between his slender fingers. From the corner of his eye, he noticed a shadow at the doorway.
Only then did the others realize Adrienne was already standing there.
Someone whispered, ""Who told her about this?""
No one responded. Clearly, she had come uninvited.
Adrienne lowered her eyes. Her palm-sized face, framed by bangs tucked neatly behind one ear, gave her an air of innocence. No one would think she could do shameless things, but she had.
She was holding a gift, eyes fixed on Garrett at the center of the room. A tight ache pressed against her chest, and she gripped the gift even tighter.
She walked toward him, but before she could offer the gift she had prepared with care, he frowned slightly and gave a casual sneer. ""Who told you to come?""
Laughter rippled around them, breaking her pride piece by piece.
Bethany Pierce rolled her eyes at Garrett and tugged Adrienne to sit down. ""She's your wife, after all. It's only right she brings you a gift. Come, Adrienne, sit down. Garrett just has a bad temper.""
Adrienne pressed her lips together, saying nothing. She was his wife, yet it was his ex-fiancee who had to smooth things over. No one here wanted her around, but she still came. She did simply because when he was eighteen, he had once said he wanted to spend his twenty-eighth birthday with her.
She sat down next to Garrett, squeezing Bethany aside.
Bethany froze a moment before her face turned grim. Then she asked, ""So, what did you get for Garry?""
A curious guest opened the gift without asking. It was a scarf, with no tags, clearly handmade.
Bethany spoke up again, ""Oh wow, we're really on the same wavelength. Look! I got Garry a scarf, too!""
The two scarves were placed side by side, both hand-knit. It was hard to tell which one was better.
Suddenly, someone bumped the table by accident. An open bottle of wine tipped over, spilling across both scarves.
Garrett reached over and picked up one of them. The other was soaked, reeking of alcohol.
Chapter 2
He had picked Bethany's.
Adrienne stared, frozen, as the scarf she spent two months knitting drowned in wine. The color drained from her face, and her heart felt like it had been dipped in ice.
Bethany sighed and took Adrienne's arm as if she were trying to comfort her. ""Don't be upset, Adrienne. He can still use it after you wash it.""
Adrienne didn't respond. She turned her gaze to Garrett.
He lowered his lashes, hiding his expression.
The atmosphere in the room shifted. Adrienne seemed to be a buzzkill here. Everyone stood up and began saying their goodbyes.
She sat still, staring at the scarf on the coffee table. It looked just like her.
The others gradually filed out. When she saw Garrett getting ready to leave as well, she softly said, ""Garrett, happy birthday.""
Garrett acted like he hadn't heard. Everyone here was part of his inner circle. He had only been brought back into the Melendez family at twenty-one, already a self-made business star. At the time, it was nineteen-year-old Adrienne by his side.
Seven years had passed. The business prodigy had become a giant among elites, but their relationship was long dead.
Those days they spent struggling together in obscurity felt like a lifetime ago.
Garrett asked someone to escort Bethany home.
She patted his shoulder gently. ""Talk it out, okay? Stop fighting all the time.""
Someone scoffed. ""Beth, you really are patient.""
""I'm not patient. I just think Adrienne didn't know better back then. I'm sure she didn't mean it.""
""Didn't mean it, my ass. She ruined someone's life and shamelessly stole your place. How dare she still show up?""
The voice dripped with disgust and slowly faded.
Adrienne sat motionless, like someone paralyzed. Every inch of her blood had gone cold, her lips colorless.
She stood, grabbed the soaked scarf, and looked at Garrett.
""Garrett.""
She called out sweetly.
He already had his blazer draped over his arm. At her voice, he tugged at his tie irritably and didn't look at her. ""What now?"" He sounded annoyed.
She smiled as she spoke. ""Let's get a divorce, Garrett.""
A flash of surprise crossed his eyes, quickly followed by a dark scowl. ""What new stunt is this? First, you drugged me to sleep with you. And now you're all high and mighty, wanting a divorce. Aren't you tired of yourself, Adrienne?""
""I'm sorry I wasted three years of your time. But I mean it this time.""
The sarcasm in his eyes faded bit by bit. He suddenly yanked her close, his fingers gripping her chin harshly. Seeing her wince in pain finally eased some of the tight frustration in his chest. ""Now you say you wasted my time? What the hell were you thinking three years ago? Listen to me, Adrienne. You want a divorce, right? You won't get a cent from me!""
""I'll walk away with nothing.""
Her eyes were clear, her voice calm.
Back then, after Garrett was brought back to the Melendez family, Adrienne, who stayed by his side, was taken in as their goddaughter. Everyone knew the truth. Actually, the Melendez parents didn't want their long-lost second son marrying a woman of average background, so they gave her a goddaughter title to quiet the gossip.
Garrett stared at her cool, quiet face. His throat moved silently as he turned around.
""Fine. Walk away with nothing. Just don't regret it.""
It had started raining outside at some point. The villa was on a mountaintop in the suburbs, and it was hard to get a ride here.
Chapter 3
Everyone else had already left in their cars. Adrienne had taken a cab to get here, and now she was the last one remaining.
A black Rolls-Royce cut through the rain and stopped in front of her. The window rolled down, revealing Jared Hinton's face.
He was Garrett's assistant.
""Mrs. Melendez, please get in.""
Adrienne stood motionless in the rain. Through the narrow gap of the car window, she seemed to know someone was sitting inside.
She said nothing, and Garrett's voice rang out.
""Drive. Let her stand there and cool her head.""
Jared looked a little embarrassed and avoided looking at Adrienne as he drove away.
Adrienne blinked at the departing car. The rain drifted in, landing on her face, its chill seeping deep into her bones.
When Garrett was eighteen, he had looked forward to spending his twenty-eighth birthday with her. But now that he was twenty-eight, he loathed her completely.
In the past three years, he had not touched her once. He barely even came home.
People in their circle all said she was the most pitiful woman among those who had married into wealthy families. Aside from a beautiful gilded cage, she had nothing.
In their eyes, she was the wicked woman who had turned Loretta into a vegetable and stolen Bethany's fiance. She deserved the worst possible punishment in the world.
But it seemed no one remembered how she had stayed by his side from age twelve to nineteen, through all his hard times.
They all said the Melendez family had already given her the status of goddaughter, yet she was still ungrateful since she was trying to use their seven years together to morally bind Garrett for life.
Just like that, another seven years had passed. In total, she had already spent fourteen years by Garrett's side.
She lowered her lashes, staring at her phone screen. Still, no driver was willing to accept the ride request.
By the time she returned to Cloudhaven Mansion, it was already 2 a.m. The hem of her dress was soaked and clung to her ankles. In the chill of late autumn, her lips trembled slightly from the cold.
The lights were still on inside the villa. As she changed her shoes at the entrance, she saw the man sitting on the couch handling work.
Garrett was gorgeous. No matter how long one looked at that face, it still struck awe and fascination.
Sitting there, he looked majestic and unattainable.
Adrienne never thought he was waiting for her. The two had completely torn things apart three years ago. She had once been bright and radiant, but later, staring into the mirror, she barely recognized the madwoman.
She quietly changed her shoes, tossed the scarf into the trash can at the door, and went upstairs.
The master bedroom still held many of her belongings. It was clean and cozy. Since Garrett seldom came home in the past three years, everyone mocked her for being like a living widow.
She packed a small suitcase with just her everyday clothes. As for those luxury handbags and jewelry, she had never touched them.
Garrett had said she didn't deserve them.
In his eyes, she was a gold-digger blinded by money, and keeping the luxury items without letting her use them was his way of tormenting her.
Adrienne carried the suitcase downstairs and placed the signed divorce agreement on the coffee table.
""Garrett, I've signed it.""
The past three years were full of arguments. To be precise, it was her accusing him of his indifference, like a madwoman trying to get his attention. And he would just stand there, watching her lose control.
Chapter 4
Garrett's gaze dropped from the computer to her suitcase. His throat burned, scorching all the way from his throat to his stomach.
He let out a cold laugh. His mocking voice was sharp and cruel.
""Bringing so little? What, planning to come back every so often to get the rest? Adrienne, did you forget how you got this position in the first place? I was engaged to Bethany, and you drugged me during our engagement party, made sure we were caught in bed together, and forced me to marry you.""
""It was my fault.""
She gripped the suitcase handle tightly, her face pale, the hem of her dress damp, her whole body seeming ready to collapse.
Her fingertips clenched as she fell silent for a moment and then forced herself to speak.
""Garrett, it's been bothering me a lot. Why did you stop loving me?""
She had asked herself this question countless times over the past three years. Back when they curled up together in a cramped apartment, he once said Garrett would love Adrienne for a lifetime. Later, when he was found by the Melendez family, someone warned her to take the money and leave early, as the Melendez family would never accept a daughter-in-law like her.
But she didn't listen. She clung to that promise, waiting for the day he would marry her in glory.
What she got instead was news of his engagement to Bethany. He told her he didn't love her anymore.
How could love just disappear like that?
""Because you don't deserve it.""
Those five words hit her like a hammer to the head.
She couldn't describe the pain. Her heart ached.
When he loved her, he said she was the best girl in the world. When he didn't, he simply said she didn't deserve it.
With her lowly background, she had defended love in front of those wealthy, arrogant elites. To them, she was just a woman who didn't know her place.
But she had always believed that his engagement was due to reasons beyond his control.
She had been lying to herself for three years. Now it was time to wake up.
She lifted her suitcase and walked to the entrance. ""Then sign the papers. I'll be waiting at the courthouse at noon tomorrow.""
After saying that, she changed her shoes, tucked her hair behind her ear, and smiled. ""Garrett, I'm sorry. I've troubled you all these years.""
Garrett's hand trembled around the contract files. His grip was so tight it nearly tore the paper. Then he suddenly let go, defeated.
""Yes. Finally free.""
Hearing that, Adrienne couldn't deny that it hurt. She wanted to smile, but found she couldn't.
So she simply turned and left.
Jared was waiting at the door. Seeing her with the suitcase, he looked troubled. ""Mrs. Melendez, Mr. Melendez didn't mean to leave you out tonight. He just...""
Adrienne dragged her suitcase into the rain as if she couldn't stand staying another second.
But after walking a few steps, she stopped, looked at Jared, and asked softly, ""Greystone Estate... the woman he's been keeping there. Who is she? Can you tell me?""
Jared froze, head snapping down quickly as if shocked she knew about that place.
Seeing his reaction, Adrienne took a breath. ""He's been keeping someone there for three years, hasn't he?""
""Mrs. Melendez, I'm sorry. I don't know.""
How could he not? He was Garrett's assistant. He handled everything for himself.
Adrienne wiped the light drizzle off her face. Her clothes were already soaked through. ""It's fine. If you don't want to say it, forget it.""
Chapter 5
""Mrs. Melendez...""
Adrienne had already stepped into the rain.
When she gave Garrett her first time at eighteen, she had imagined their future.
She never thought that at twenty-six, everything would be in ruins. Letting him go felt like tearing out half of herself.
But she really didn't want him anymore.
When she dragged her suitcase to Bonnie Norton's place, she felt embarrassed.
She had walked out of Cloudhaven Mansion with nothing but 20 dollars in cash.
During the three years of marriage, repeated arguments had driven her into severe depression. She didn't dare see anyone and stayed home every day practicing cooking. Even when her hands were covered in blisters from burns, she didn't care. She still loved Garrett and wanted to save their marriage.
But no matter how many times the food went cold, he never once touched it.
Bonnie wasn't her biological sister. They had run away from their village together, and Bonnie was soon adopted by a family. Now she was married and lived a simple but warm life in a small apartment with her partner.
Later, Adrienne met Garrett. When she was on the brink of starvation, he threw her a slice of toast, and shamelessly, she clung to him. They traveled around, working odd jobs to make ends meet.
Adrienne was still dripping wet. She wiped her face and rang the doorbell.
Bonnie opened the door in her pajamas, a bit surprised. A man's impatient voice came from the bedroom. ""Who is it?""
Bonnie pulled her inside and quickly went to the bathroom to fetch a clean towel.
""Adri, what are you doing here in the middle of the night? You're soaking wet. Did you have a fight with Garrett?""
""Bonnie, can I stay here for the night?""
""Of course. There's a spare room. It's small, though. Hope you don't mind.""
Bonnie handed her clean pajamas and started making the bed.
The bathroom was cramped, barely fitting two people, but it had a separate shower. The corners were stained with years-old brown limescale.
Adrienne took a quick shower. She didn't have the nerve to blow-dry her hair this late, so she went straight to the bedroom.
It really was small, only enough for a queen-sized bed and a small desk.
She heard Bonnie's husband's voice from the master bedroom.
""Who was that?""
""Adri. Probably had a fight with Garrett.""
""She's a rich man's wife. What's she doing here? Don't you know what kind of man Garrett is? I worked at the Melendez Group for three years and never even got to meet the guy.""
""Enough. Adri is like my sister.""
The whispers stopped.
Adrienne wiped her hair. Her black, glossy strands were wrapped in a towel, water still dripping from the ends.
She tucked the ends into the towel and lay down on the bed.
By 7 a.m., the clatter of dishes could be heard from outside.
Her hair had dried naturally overnight, but her head throbbed. She pushed herself to get up.
Breakfast was ready. Terrence Pratt stood by the table, setting the plates. When he saw her, he called out warmly, ""Adri, come sit down. I went out early this morning to buy fish. Bonnie made fish soup for you.""
They were both office workers. Normally, breakfast was just a few slices of bread. The elaborate meal was clearly for Adrienne.
Bonnie brought over the soup and smiled at her. ""Breakfast time.""
Adrienne's skin was fair and glowing. After she had clung to Garrett at age twelve, he never treated her poorly.
Back then, she thought it was love, but he had only ever seen her as a little sister.
Chapter 6
Her lashes drooped. She looked unwell.
Terrence nudged some food toward her. ""Your sister got up at five to cook. Adri, did you know I work at the Melendez Group? My supervisor is always sucking up to the boss. Yesterday, he even yelled at a young woman in our department. I heard he got in through connections, and he has cut my salary twice. Could you maybe talk to Garrett for me?""
Bonnie shot him a glare, but Terrence just smiled.
Bonnie quickly brought the soup to Adrienne. ""You don't look so good. You got soaked last night, too. Have some soup and warm up. Don't listen to him.""
Adrienne looked up, her pale face tinged with a sickly blush. ""Terrence, I'm sorry. Garrett and I are divorced.""
The room fell silent for a few seconds.
Surprise flashed across Terrence's face before he asked, ""So that means you got half his assets, right? Adri, even though he paid for your top university, I remember you got married right after graduation and never worked. I'm worried you don't know how to manage money. You might get scammed.""
""Terrence!""
Bonnie scolded sharply.
Terrence fell silent and started eating.
Bonnie and Adrienne had known each other since childhood. They had run off to Gerberton together. Survival alone was hard. Bonnie was adopted, and Adrienne drifted through jobs with Garrett. Fortunately, he treated her well and even sent her to college.
Bonnie sighed. ""Just save your money properly. If you want to buy a house, Terrence can give you advice. He's got a friend who...""
""I left with nothing.""
Adrienne didn't touch the fish soup. ""He didn't give me any money.""
Terrence's face fell. He pulled the plate back toward himself and stood up. He told Bonnie, ""By the way, Mom wants to take you for a checkup in a few days. Clean up the guest room. We need to prioritize family first.""
Bonnie didn't respond. The living room door opened and shut. Terrence was gone.
The feast on the table suddenly lost all its flavor.
""Bonnie, I'm sorry for putting you in this position.""
Bonnie's eyes turned red. She sighed. ""I'm not upset. What happened between you two? I remember he used to treat you so well. Back when you were secretly working behind his back, he scolded you. He worked five jobs a day to pay for both your tuition and gave all his scholarship money to you. Do you remember the year you had that car accident and nearly suffered brain damage? He worked nonstop translating to earn money for your recovery. And now that he's wealthy...""
Adrienne's throat hurt, and even swallowing was painful.
It was because their past was poor but beautiful that she clung to the fragile thread of their bond, carefully holding on for seven years. Only when she was covered in wounds did she finally convince herself to let go.
""Bonnie, I'll go job-hunting this afternoon.""
""Adri, if you want to cry, just cry.""
She couldn't. After three years of marriage, her tears had long run dry.
She had breakfast and offered to wash the dishes. Bonnie saw her beautiful, slender hands covered in grease and felt a pang of sympathy.
""Your hands weren't meant for chores. Even when Garrett was poor, he never let you do this.""
Adrienne froze. A wave of pain rushed over her, crushing her.
Bonnie had to head to work and left in a hurry.
Adrienne stayed alone until noon before picking up her documents and heading to the courthouse.
But even by 1 p.m., Garrett didn't show.
Chapter 7
She took out her phone and called him.
As usual, he didn't answer.
So she called Jared.
""Mr. Hinton, where is Garrett?""
""Mrs. Melendez, Mr. Melendez is on a business trip. He won't be back for three days.""
For the past three years, she had only been able to know Garrett's schedule through Jared.
She sat on the bench, her head spinning, her elbows resting on her knees. ""Can you give me his itinerary? I want to see when he's free.""
Jared looked awkwardly at the man sitting nearby.
""Mrs. Melendez, Mr. Melendez really hasn't had any time lately. He just finished a major acquisition, and the new company's accounts are a complete mess.""
Adrienne fell silent. She knew Garrett was busy. He was so busy that over the past three years, he had forgotten their wedding anniversary, her birthday, and every holiday. She had spent them all alone at home.
""Alright, if he comes back, could you give me a call and let me know?""
""Sure, Mrs. Melendez.""
Adrienne hung up the phone and stared blankly at the bustling crowd inside the courthouse. Newlywed couples beamed with joy, while divorced pairs passed by like strangers, treating each other like disgusting pests to avoid.
She pulled out her phone and started browsing job postings from nearby companies. Her resume had long been prepared. First things first, she needed to find a job.
She had studied vocal performance in college, but after what happened with Loretta Pierce, she was terrified of singing. She couldn't bring herself to sing a single note anymore.
Her lashes lowered as she slowly scrolled through job listings, eventually settling on a mid-sized company that was looking for an assistant to the director. There were no professional requirements listed. The only requirements were about height, weight, and appearance.
She sent her resume in, and within three minutes, the company called her, asking her to come in for an interview that afternoon.
Having never worked before, she didn't understand all the twists and turns of the industry. At first, she even thought it might be a scam.
But when she actually sat down in front of the interviewer, the woman glanced at her face and nodded. ""When can you start?""
Adrienne was a little surprised. ""Aren't you going to ask about my qualifications?""
""You're a music major. What qualifications could you possibly have? The job mostly involves attending business dinners with the director. The pay is high, but it runs on youth. Think it over.""
""Alright.""
She was led to handle onboarding paperwork. It wasn't until she met the director that she realized that it was someone she knew.
Back when she had just married Garrett three years ago, she had met this director once. At the time, he was a senior executive at the Melendez Group. He didn't recognize her and, during a company party, mistook her for a waitress and tried to kiss her, only to be caught by Garrett.
Soon after, word spread that he had gotten himself in trouble at the company and had been fired.
His name was Willard Gibson. At that moment, her resume was pulled up on his computer screen.
""I thought I was seeing things. Isn't this Garrett's woman? Coming to my little company looking for work. How surprising! What, did he dump you?""
His gaze remained burning as he stared at her, slowly closing his laptop. ""I heard your husband barely comes home, even after three years. How does he have the heart?""
Adrienne truly was stunning. She was quiet, gentle, and breathtaking. The more you looked at her, the harder it was to look away.
Chapter 8
Standing in the office in simple jeans and a white blouse, she looked like a delicate lotus in clear water.
""Mr. Gibson.""
She called out softly. If Willard dared to try anything else, she would quit on the spot.
But Willard only snorted and gave her a once-over. ""3,000 dollars a month. You'll attend dinners with me and prep my paperwork. Can you drive?""
""I can.""
""Perfect. Mrs. Melendez is now reduced to being my driver. I'm honored.""
""I'm already divorced from Garrett.""
Willard squinted and then smiled. ""Oh, I see. No wonder such a beautiful woman's back on the market. You can start now. Come with me to a business dinner tonight. I'll transfer half your salary in advance. Deal?""
Adrienne didn't know what gave away her current desperation, but he'd guessed right.
She lowered her lashes and whispered, ""Alright.""
Someone quickly came to guide her through the rest of the onboarding process and assigned her a desk.
Adrienne felt like she might be running a fever. Her body was growing hotter by the minute.
Near the end of the workday, Willard called her into his office and tossed her a set of car keys. ""From now on, you're my driver and assistant. We're leaving now. I'll text you my upcoming schedule.""
""Yes, Mr. Gibson.""
She clutched the keys, made her way to the parking garage, found his car, opened the door for him, then got in the driver's seat.
Willard was on the phone with someone, showing off. ""You won't believe who I just hired as an assistant. Remember Garrett Melendez?""
Everyone in Gerberton knew Garrett. Even before the Melendez family brought him back, he was already a rising star. With his unreal looks, he was a self-made legend. Back then, he was everywhere.
Later, when he returned to his roots and gained the Melendez name, he became even more famous.
But in recent years, he had kept a low profile, focused on business, and never given interviews. Slowly, he faded from public view.
Still, in Gerberton's elite circles, no one didn't know him.
Though Willard now operated in a lower business tier, he had once been part of the Melendez Group's leadership and had built up some contacts.
""Yeah, his wife's my driver now. Crazy, right? The guy used to act like a god.""
The car stopped in front of a well-known hotel. Adrienne parked and opened the door for Willard.
True to his word, he had already wired her $1,500.
A few insulting words from him were nothing. Compared to the humiliation she'd endured in Garrett's world, this was nothing.
She diligently fulfilled her assistant duties, even pressing the elevator button for him. But to her surprise, the elevator wasn't empty. Inside stood Garrett and Jared.
Jared's eyes briefly flickered with surprise. Then he quickly glanced at Garrett and stayed quiet.
Adrienne also said nothing. It was Willard who spoke first. ""Mr. Melendez, what a coincidence.""
Garrett's presence was overwhelming. Though the elevator was spacious and held only four people, it felt suffocating.
Willard stepped in first, smiling. ""Come in, Ms. Norton. What, need an invitation?""
Adrienne finally stepped inside and pressed the button for the fifth floor.
The fifth floor was for business dining. It was expensive, but still more accessible than the seventh, which was reserved for VIPs and nearly impossible to book.
Garrett was headed for the seventh.
As the elevator arrived on the fifth floor and Adrienne prepared to step out, Garrett suddenly spoke. ""Jared.""
Jared stiffened, waiting for instructions.
But Garrett simply called his name, nothing more.
Chapter 9
Adrienne's steps paused for a few seconds before she slowly walked out. The elevator doors closed behind her.
Jared felt so relieved. He swallowed hard. ""I'll look into it right away.""
To find out why Adrienne was here, and she was with Willard.
That man had once nearly kissed her by force. Garrett had been furious back then and had her taken away immediately.
The elevator reached the seventh floor. Garrett stepped out. ""No need. If she wants to fall, let her.""
After all, it wasn't like it was her first time sleeping around.
Jared wisely said nothing and followed behind.
Meanwhile, in the private room, Willard pushed open the door and greeted the people inside.
""Sorry, folks. Ran into someone I knew in the elevator. Took a few extra minutes.""
The room was filled with potential business partners. Most of them were small-time entrepreneurs.
One of them teased, ""Your new assistant's really something. That face could make her a star.""
Willard grinned proudly. ""She's not interested in that kind of spotlight.""
A group of middle-aged men began cracking crude jokes, their eyes roaming over Adrienne's body.
She lowered her lashes, pretending not to notice.
Willard jerked his chin. ""Go pour a drink for Mr. Camacho. He's been looking at you all night.""
Adrienne got up and walked over to Ernest Camacho, bending down to pour him a glass of wine.
Ernest's gaze lingered on her face, and he raised his hand to touch her waist, but she dodged with her wine glass. ""Mr. Camacho, a toast to you.""
Looking a little embarrassed, Ernest didn't push it further and finished his drink.
Adrienne returned to Willard's side, once again taking on her obedient demeanor.
The middle-aged men finally got to the point and began discussing the real purpose of the evening.
After the talk, someone said, ""I just saw Garrett Melendez in the first-floor lobby. The aura he carries is no joke. Is the Melendez family planning to make the second son the heir? Will the eldest really go along with that?""
Among truly powerful families, sibling rivalry could be brutal.
""The eldest is refined and gentle, while Garrett came up from the grassroots. They have totally different temperaments. Garrett is ruthless, and the rest of the family is wary of him. I heard the eldest even indulges him quite a bit. No one knows if it's genuine or just a front.""
""Hey, how could we common folk understand all the twists and turns of elite families? I handed my business card to Garrett once. He didn't even glance at it.""
""That's because you tried to curry favor with the wrong person. I once complimented the lady with him, Ms. Pierce, at a banquet, and he took my card right away.""
Willard, now thirty-nine, looked at Adrienne with a touch of sympathy.
She was used to it and listened quietly.
""Garrett really treats Bethany well. He takes her to every event. I heard they nearly got married years ago, but some lowly woman drugged him and ruined everything.""
""Come to think of it. Has anyone ever seen what that wife of his actually looks like?""
Everyone started freely speculating about Garrett's relationship with his wife. Maybe he loathed her, or maybe he'd already torn that disgraceful woman to shreds.
Just then, Willard chuckled lightly. ""Adrienne probably knows best about that. Why don't you tell us? Did Garrett have her torn to pieces?""
Adrienne's lashes trembled slightly. Her eyes swept over the gossip-hungry faces, and she said softly, ""We live in a society governed by law.""
Everyone burst out laughing, saying how witty she was.
Chapter 10
Willard laughed too, but there was no warmth in it.
He wasn't like the others. He'd worked at the Melendez Group's upper levels.
Adrienne smiled along, then excused herself to the restroom.
Standing before the mirror in the women's restroom, she looked at her pale reflection. Her forehead pulsed with dizziness, and she felt like vomiting.
She splashed water on her face to wake herself up. As she stepped out, she saw Garrett leaning casually nearby.
This whole floor had only standard private rooms. Why was he here?
But that wasn't what mattered most to her.
""Garrett.""
She called out. ""Weren't you on a business trip? Are you free tomorrow?""
His gaze lingered on her cheek. ""Tomorrow's the weekend. The courthouse isn't open. You really are cut out to be a housewife.""
She was used to his sarcasm and didn't react emotionally. She looked toward Willard's room. ""Then I'll contact Jared on Monday.""
She used to call Garrett often, but he never answered. Eventually, she got used to going through Jared.
Garrett scoffed coldly. ""Suit yourself.""
Adrienne didn't say anything more and turned to head back to the room, but then he said, ""Isn't staying at home as a housewife better than being talked about by a bunch of greasy old men? Adrienne, I remember you used to have some pride.""
In three years of marriage, he'd come home very few times.
All her pride had been worn down by depression.
It had taken years and countless efforts for her to get better.
""Garrett, I feel more dignified here than I ever did by your side.""
His entire demeanor turned icy, and something frightening flickered in his eyes.
He strode over and grabbed her wrist. ""What did you say? Say it again!""
His grip on her chin hurt. She pressed her lips together, looking at him calmly.
His eyes were dangerously dark, like a stormy night.
Several seconds passed before he slowly released her and casually shoved his hands into his pockets. ""Then stay here with them. Don't come back. Adrienne, we should've parted ways a long time ago.""
""I know.""
She nodded seriously and smiled. ""I won't come looking for you.""
But years ago, she had held his hand and said that no matter where he went, she'd always find him.
Garrett didn't look at her again and walked away with large strides.
Adrienne didn't flatter herself into thinking he'd come down just for her. She pushed the door open and walked back into the room.
Willard had just wrapped up the conversation and was getting ready to leave.
Earlier, when Adrienne stepped out, Ernest had signaled to Willard, suggesting she take him home.
Everyone knew exactly what that kind of suggestion meant.
These men were all tightly controlled by their families. They didn't dare have female assistants officially, but all had mistresses on the side.
And none of those women looked as stunning as Adrienne.
One night with her would be like heaven.
Willard gave Adrienne a slight shove, but didn't push her all the way toward Ernest. ""Ms. Norton, look at how you've got Mr. Camacho all worked up.""
Adrienne smoothly followed his lead. ""My mistake. I'll treat Mr. Camacho to a drink another day. May I have your card?""
Ernest, now very satisfied, handed her his card.
Adrienne accepted it carefully, and the sight pleased him even more. Right then and there, he agreed to partner with Willard.
Willard immediately handed Adrienne the prepared contract.
She was at a bit of a loss, but Ernest didn't want to see her struggle. He signed the contract on the spot and even gave her a reassuring pat on the shoulder.
Chapter 11
""Ms. Norton, don't forget to give me a call. You young folks have a lot to learn.""
Adrienne smiled. ""Of course, of course.""
By now, they were in the hotel lobby. Coincidentally, Garrett and his companions stepped out of another elevator.
Two close friends stood beside Garrett. One was Carlos Decker, a doctor, and the other was Norman Doyle.
Neither of them liked her.
She hadn't attended a single event these past few years.
She didn't go over to greet them. But Carlos saw her and slowly raised an eyebrow. ""Isn't that Adrienne?""
Everyone turned to look, and at that exact moment, Ernest's hand was still resting on her shoulder. It was obvious to all that he was taking advantage.
Ernest finally noticed Garrett and the others. His demeanor changed instantly, and he hurried over.
""Mr. Melendez, Mr. Doyle, I've heard so much about you both. Mr. Melendez, do you remember me? I once handed you my business card.""
He bowed and scraped like he was ready to lick their shoes.
Garrett's eyes moved past him and landed on Adrienne.
She didn't look at him, still speaking with Willard.
Willard, nearly forty but well-maintained, met Garrett's gaze with a wide smile.
Adrienne stood at the side, expressionless.
Garrett couldn't remember when exactly she stopped smiling.
The last time he saw her truly smile with spirit had been years ago.
His throat bobbed silently. His gaze shifted to Ernest.
""Get lost.""
Ernest's face turned pale instantly. Not knowing how he had provoked Garrett, he froze in place, too frightened to move.
Garrett strode away without sparing Adrienne a single glance.
Ernest stood dumbfounded where he was. Only after everyone had vanished from sight did he realize his back was drenched in sweat. He felt utterly humiliated and quickly found an excuse to leave, looking very much like he was fleeing in defeat.
The others followed and left as well.
Adrienne opened the car door for Willard.
Once inside, Willard picked up the contract and glanced at it. ""You did pretty well tonight. I thought you'd throw a fit.""
He was referring to what had happened with Ernest. It was obvious the man wanted to sleep with her.
In the past, Adrienne would have found it unbearable.
But now, to survive, she had to endure it. Her professional skills weren't much help anymore.
""Mr. Gibson, I really need money right now.""
Willard loosened his tie and leaned back. ""What's going on between you and Garrett?""
Even a fool could tell Garrett treated her differently.
""We're divorced.""
""Whoa, that's big news. I remember one time I nearly kissed you while drunk. He broke three of my ribs and had me fired from the Melendez Group. Do you know how high I was standing in the company back then? Firing me caused a lot of pressure.""
After all, at that time, Garrett was in a power struggle with his older brother.
Adrienne stepped on the gas, her face calm. ""It definitely wasn't because of me.""
Willard hadn't climbed to the top of the Melendez Group by being stupid. He understood the situation well. One lesson had been enough. He wouldn't dare lay a hand on Adrienne again. Garrett was like a mad dog. Once he locked on to someone, they'd be lucky to come away with their skin intact.
He closed his eyes and gave his home address. ""Pick me up at 6:30 every morning. Let me approve all the itinerary plans. You did well tonight. You should've realized during the interview that your position is about selling looks, so professional skills aren't really required. Whether you get taken advantage of depends on your own ability.""
Chapter 12
Her tactics with Ernest were smart. A few compliments inflated his ego and made him feel like a hero. So when he saw her struggling with the contract, he didn't hesitate to sign.
Forty minutes later, the car pulled up outside Willard's home. He grabbed the contract and got out. ""This is one of my spare cars. When you're not picking me up, you can use it. Just remember to get reimbursed for the gas.""
To be fair, Willard was professional and drew clear lines. That was not bad.
Adrienne nodded. Only after he went inside did she drive off.
Her sister, Bonnie, called just then.
""Adri, it's so late. Why aren't you home yet?""
Before Adrienne could answer, Terrence's voice came through the phone. ""Why are you bothering with her? She's been kicked out. I've looked into it. Mr. Melendez has someone new now. She's really useless. She spent all those years with him and didn't even get a house out of it.""
Bonnie's tone instantly turned awkward. ""Adri, Terrence had a rough day at work. He's just in a bad mood. Don't take it to heart.""
At that moment, Adrienne had just pulled up outside Bonnie's apartment and was going to knock on the door.
Bonnie opened the door, concerned by Adrienne's pale face. ""Are you sick? You just got caught in the rain last night.""
""I came to get my luggage. I'm planning to rent a place.""
""What? Why rent? Rent's expensive here, and you don't have much money.""

Honestly the is12 thing got annoying at the end, seeing his grin was cool, but honestly I was stabbing this guy since containment and I wish there was an ending where you put him down before reaching the island. 

The island itself looks like a really cool home… but the ending kinda makes it a less enjoyable, what with the endless sound and wind.

Also I’ve noticed my traders have vanished, all except bitchboy (the guy with the coffee mug who never shuts it) and he’s always in my home now. It’s oddly quieter, with the other two not showing up. (They’re back just took a while)

Overall? Fun fight, bit tedious, a bit sad that the cool island has an eternal ambience that won’t go away, but if it means more worlds to explore and more science to have?

I hadn’t seen him in like, half a decade but we were catching up on Instagram recently & he eventually asked me to go see a movie together. I agreed and we had a good time.

He picked me up, we went to get coffee, chatted outside the coffee house for like an hour, and then went to the movie. I think the date was a success.. he was super gentleman-like and I felt like he was wanting to be close to me (ex: he grabbed my hand during the movie, he put his arm around my waist walking out of the theater) and he wanted to keep the night going after the movie ended at like 10:30 ish. He offered that we could go play pool but I wanted to go home and said we could do that another time, I was just tired and mistakenly didn’t eat anything all day.

However, the messages from last night and today make me think otherwise? I texted to thank him after he dropped me off at home that same night of course because I think that’s the right thing to do, he responded politely. I texted him first this afternoon just asking how his Sunday is.. but I can’t tell if he’s not interested or if he’s trying to match my energy or what? He isn’t really asking me anything or responding quickly but idk if I’m reading into that too much.

I always struggle with dating especially when it comes to the “rules of texting,” like how long you should take to respond to someone. It seems like he’s intentionally waiting like two hours so I’m trying to match that but I’m going mad. Do I not respond anymore and leave the ball in his court?

48 ton 5 zone mini split. Mitsubishi. 2 years old.

Located in Seattle WA. 

Last week we noticed 2 of our wall mounted air handlers had a sweetish coffee like smell coming out of them. The other units were fine. 

I go on google...refrigerant leak maybe? But multiple indoor units leaking at the same exact time? Highly unlikely. 

No loss in cooling capacity. 

I switch everything to heat mode to maybe dry out the coils? Heats up great.

I turn everything off. Deep clean. Nu-Cal on the interior coils. Gentle rinsing. Clean filters. All units are draining ""condensate"" perfectly. Outdoor coil is carefully rinsed with hose only. (Per reddit advice!)

Turn everything down to 70, cooling mode. Measure the split across inlet and outlet for each handler after running for 10min. Split is ~25deg. Uniform across the condensers. Measured with a laser. 

No obvious smell.....

A few days go by. Smell returns. Same units. I noticed a few were cooling in other zones and these 2 that smell were just in fan mode. 

I crank them down from 74 to 70. They start cooling and the smell goes away quickly. WTF. 

It doesnt seem likely to be a freon leak...no loss in cooling or heating capacity. 

Not likely mildew growth...although I did not remove the fans etc....but seems unlikely also.

1mn38e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1mn38e2/my_hopes_for_whats_to_come_in_fallout_5/,My hopes for whats to come in fallout 5,"I live to play fallout, I absolitally love it and now that I've heard fallout 5 was greenlit I wanna talk about all the stuff I want from old games and all the new stuff I hope we get.

1: Fallout 5 should be a single player game with optional online multiplayer. Lego fortnite has a key system for worlds where you can grant a key to a world to a friend and then you and that friend can join the world at any given time even if the other one isn't online, I believe that that is how Fallout 5 should be. Away this would work is also like how Lego fortnite has it where if one person completes a quest they get the rewards for it but the quest is also completed for everyone else that is in that world, if another person wants the quest Rewards they have to do the quest together. Being able to restart or redo a quest would also be a great option however this shouldn't be an option for every quest in the game, and you should also only get the reward from that Quest the first time you yourself do it.

2: Karma system: I don't think I need to explain why this is so unbeliveably important and obvious. Litterally everyone wants this back.

3: faction reputation is wanted just as badly as the karma system is and Fallout 5 should definitely have it, including wearing disguises to fit in with different factions that you are enemies with. You should also be able to create your own faction, whether it be a Raider gang, mercenary group like the gunners, or something else entirely it would be an amazing change.

4: I believe Fallout 5 should have less actual settlements, different than no settlements at all, and instead you should be able to build the bases wherever you want. Ways to limit the amount of bases you can have and where they are placed are making it so you have to have them a certain distance apart from each other, if you don't visit a base enough or protect it enough it can be taken over by a Raider gang or a group of super mutants, or the settlers that live there just no longer recognize you as their leader and kick you out. You could also abandon a base altogether and then later come back to find that it has been taken over by an enemy group and if you want it back you'll have to take them out, however you shouldn't have to do it alone you should be able to get with a group of settlers that you have at another base and have them join you in the retaking of your previous base. Basically you should be able to start wars with and or raid other bases/ settlements.

5: you should be able to have more than one companion traveling with you at any given time, and I don't just mean a human and a dog at the same time. You should have up to three companion slots the first slot being for a human the second slot being for an animal and the third slot being for an eyebot or other small flying creature.

6: I think Fallout 5 should have actual taming and recruiting. As in you go out and slowly gain the trust of an animal or individual and can later ask them to join you. Imagine walking through a friendly location and spotting an NPC you think looks really cool or pretty and you want them as a companion or a settler, you can go up to them talk with them gain their trust and eventually recruit them to join you. Imagine you're walking around out in the Wasteland and come across an animal that you really want as a pet, you feed it gain its trust and eventually ask it to join you.

7: the fighting in Fallout games is slightly lackluster, and Fallout 4 melee combat is abysmal and the Gunplay isn't very interesting. Fighting in the third person perspective is even worse as most of the time your bullets don't go where your Crosshair is and when you're using it melee weapon in third person it is very easy to get stun locked over and over again. Fallout 5 should have the ability to hide behind something and peek out around it by aiming in like Red Dead Redemption 2 has, in that game first person and third person are both viable options for combat and exploring but in Fallout games if you're in third person you're probably not going to have a good time.

8: there should be a more in-depth and complex weapon crafting system where you can make weapons at the beginning of the game that are really weak and eventually by the end of the game make them very powerful. When you first start the game you craft a seemingly weak and useless pistol out of scraps and then as you play through the game you slowly upgrade it more and more until it is now a fully automatic overpowered assault rifle. I also believe that there should be more medieval-styled weapons like swords knives and bows, I find it strange that an apocalyptic game like Fallout doesn't have very many melee weapons in it or crafting of said weapons. I love the idea of walking around and spotting a Raider sprinting at me holding a scrap metal shield and a weird looking sword made out of various random items. Dual weld Weaponry would also be amazing, like having two swords that you can hold one in each hand or dueling to pistols, obviously not everything can be too well as there are two handed weapons like a sledgehammer or an assault rifle but so many things can be do well.

9: Fallout 5 should have more clothing customizable options then previous follow games such as collecting different shirts pants shoes and jackets, and combining a bunch of different outfits to make cooler looks. It is a very simple change that would be drastically better than the system we have now. We also shouldn't be forced to go without armor because the jeans of the outfit were wearing have a little bit of metal on the kneecaps, that I have always found ridiculous.

10: the character customization especially for the body needs to be better, something like Sims 4 character customization instead of the simple triangle slider that we have in Fallout 4 and 76. There's also be different optional voice packs for both male and female characters, this skinny psycho addicted Raider character that I made shouldn't sound the same as this big buff brolic Brotherhood of Steel knight character that I created, unless I want them to. We should also be able to use both male and female hair on any character. As well as use makeup on male characters as well.

11: we should be able to customize our settlers to an extent, like give them haircuts or change the color of their hair or even put makeup on them. Maybe even give them names instead of just seeing settler.

12: nudity should be an option in the settings that you can turn on and off, another very simple change that wouldn't change the game that much but would make it more immersive.

13: the leveling system should go back to how it was in Fallout 3 and follow New Vegas where as you level up you can select different perks, the follow for perk chart isn't bad but I and many others prefer follow three and Fallout new Vegas's style of level UPS.

14: no battle pass, we all know follow five will have creation Club and that is fine but there is no reason a single player Fallout game should have a battle pass even if it has optional online multiplayer. Creation Club and mods are plenty a battle pass would be pointless.

15: I'm hoping that Fallout 5 will have more help from the developers on the modding side especially for the PlayStation version of the game. Fallout on PlayStation has a much worse time with modding then anything else because of the limits that Sony themselves set on how much you can change the base game around. The Developers need to find a way around this something like uploading files to the game that could be easily used to make simple mods, so that technically they are using files that are already in the game even if unused by the vanilla game itself they could still be there for the modders.

16: the graphics of Fallout 5 don't need to be hyper-realistic but they need to be better than it was in Fallout 4, the graphics of Fallout 4 kind of suck when you compare it to almost any other game. If you compare a coffee mug from Fallout 3 to Fallout 4 and ask somebody to tell you which came out later that person is going to assume the one from Fallout 3 because the coffee mug and Fallout 4 looks polygonal while the coffee mug and Fallout 3 looks like a coffee mug.
18: we cannot have a repeat of what happened with Preston Garvey, if you put a companion in the game that can give out quests either limit the amount of quests it can give you at any time or make a completely separate way to get those quests. In Fallout 4 even after retaking the castle and acquiring the Minutemen radio station and a previous member of the Minutemen Preston Garvey is still the one that gives you the quests for no reason at all, this is why me and many other people never actually kept him on as a companion because it just got annoying.

17: don't give the player character that much backstory or lore like you did in Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 76 have you play as some guy and that works. I'm not saying don't give us lower on the character we're playing as at all I'm just saying limit it.
21: you should be able to romance robots, there is not a single robot in Fallout 4 that you can Romance, Curie can only be romanced after getting a synth body. Other than robots you shouldn't just be able to romance companions, you should be able to romance any character you want to an extent. A character like Magnolia in Fallout 4 that you can romance a single time and sleep with a single time should be changed so that you can actually date them, maybe even have them visit the settlement that you stay at the most every once in awhile or convince them to come live with you at said settlement.

18: Your settlement being rated in Fallout 5 should actually have consequences. In Fallout 4 and 76 the only consequence is that in Fallout 4 a settler to might leave and in both games all you have to do is repair what was destroyed during the attack. In Fallout 5 if you fail to defend a base/settlement it should be taken over by who or what attacked you and then you have to take it back by force. Instead of seeing your settlement failed to defend itself it should now say Your settlement has been taken over by Raiders or super mutants. You can then get settlers from another base and or settlement to come help you take back the base that you lost.

19: Items/Prices: I think that items in Fallout 5 should be harder to find like bullets, and the rarer the type of bullets the more that they cost. This already exists to an extent but I think there should be things in fallouts trading system like inflation. The more you sell an item to a vendor the less they will pay for that item, and the more you buy an item from a vendor the more it costs. They should obviously have a limit so that a single round of 10 mm ammunition doesn't cost 50 caps but I think the price getting up to five caps per bullet because they don't have enough wouldn't be too bad.

20: in Fallout 3 you can enslave people for eulogy Jones and in Fallout 4 during the Nuka World DLC if you side with the Raiders you will technically own slaves as settlers. You should be able to do this in Fallout 5, either enslave people to work for you or to join you as a companion by either purchasing them from slavers or putting a slave collar on them yourself. Obviously this would take a huge hit to your karma level but I feel like it's something that should be possible in a Fallout game. depending on how you treat said slave one day they can either turn on you, run from you, or join you or side willingly.

21: Fallout 5 needs actual boss fights, stuff like The Scorch Beast Queen and Earl from Fallout 76. But not just super high Health boss fights that take forever to kill but also things like Oswald in the Fallout 4 Nuka World DLC, a boss fight that actually has waves to it and you have to take him out by doing other things first.

22: something that would be amazing is content creators voicing Side characters, imagine exploring and coming across a quaint little house next to a lake and when you go over to talk to the guy that lives there it's someone like itsJabo voicing them and giving you a little quest in that Quest is an Easter egg to something from the past for example a Jabo Easter egg would be ""hey go get me a bowling ball and drop it infront of me"" something like that. For an oxhorn side quest where he asks you to go get him a box of cigars from some Factory. I personally would absolutely love if we came across a group of children of the atom cultist that were run by a man named the rad King and he doesn't give you a quest but instead you can purchase information on different things from the Fallout Universe from him, like you could go purchase info about super mutants and he can tell you where a hideout is or how they fight what kind of weapons they use stuff like that make him an info broker. But always keep it lore friendly and not fourth wall breaker.",1,1754885344.0,Fallout,2,1.0,False

  It was nearly light when it was finally done. A streaky grey wash across the canvas of sky. Dry leaves and mud clung to his jeans, and his weak body ached as his sweat cooled in the damp, chill air. A thing had been done that could not be undone. A terrible necessary act. An ending and a beginning now knotted up for ever. He expected the hues of the world to change to reflect that, but the earth and heavens remained the same muted shades, and there was no tremble of anger from the trees. No weeping whisper of wind. No siren wailed in the distance. The woods were just the woods, and the dirt was just the dirt. He let out a long breath and it felt surprisingly good. Clean. A new dawn. A new day.  
  
  He walked in silence towards the remains of the house in the distance. He didn’t look back.

  NOW  
  
  ADELE  
  
  There’s still mud under my fingernails when David finally comes home. I can feel it stinging against my raw skin, deep under the beds. My stomach twists, wringing fresh nerves out as the front door shuts, and for a moment we just look at each other from opposite ends of the long corridor of our new Victorian house, a tract of perfectly polished wood between us, before he turns, swaying slightly, towards the sitting room. I take a deep breath and join him, flinching at each of the hard beats of my heels against the floorboards. I must not be afraid. I need to repair this. We need to repair this.  
  
  ‘I’ve cooked dinner,’ I say, trying not to sound too needy. ‘Only a stroganoff. It can keep until tomorrow if you’ve already eaten.’  
  
  He’s facing away from me, staring at our bookshelves that the unpackers have filled from the boxes. I try not to think about how long he’s been gone. I’ve cleaned up the broken glass, swept and scrubbed the floor, and dealt with the garden. All evidence of earlier rage has been removed. I rinsed my mouth out after every glass of wine I drank in his absence so he won’t smell it on me. He doesn’t like me to drink. Only ever a glass or two in company. Never alone. But tonight I couldn’t help it.  
  
  Even if I haven’t entirely got the dirt out from under my nails, I’ve showered and changed into a powder blue dress and matching heels, and put make-up on. No trace of tears and fighting. I want us to wash it all away. This is our fresh start. Our new beginning. It has to be.  
  
  ‘I’m not hungry.’ He turns to face me then, and I can see a quiet loathing in his eyes, and I bite back a sudden urge to cry. I think this emptiness is worse than his anger. Everything I’ve worked so hard to build really is crumbling. I don’t care that he’s drunk again. I only want him to love me like he used to. He doesn’t even notice the effort I’ve made since he stormed out. How busy I’ve been. How I look. How I’ve tried.  
  
  ‘I’m going to bed,’ he says. He doesn’t look me in the eye, and I know that he means the spare room. Two days into our fresh start, and he won’t be sleeping with me. I feel the cracks between us widen once more. Soon we won’t be able to reach each other across them. He walks carefully around me and I want to touch his arm but am too afraid of how he will react. He seems disgusted by me. Or perhaps it’s his disgust at himself radiating in my direction.  
  
  ‘I love you,’ I say, softly. I hate myself for it, and he doesn’t answer but unsteadily clambers the stairs as if I’m not there. I hear his footsteps recede and then a door closing.  
  
  After a moment of staring at the space where he no longer is, listening to my patchwork heart breaking, I go back to the kitchen and turn the oven off. I won’t keep it for tomorrow. It would taste sour on the memory of today. Dinner’s ruined. We’re ruined. I sometimes wonder if he wants to kill me and be done with it all. Get rid of the albatross around his neck. Perhaps some part of me wants to kill him too.  
  
  I’m tempted to have another glass of forbidden wine, but I resist. I’m te  
arful enough already and I can’t face another fight. Perhaps in the morning we’ll be fine again. I’ll replace the bottle and he’ll never know I’ve been drinking at all.  
  
  I gaze out into the garden before finally flicking the outside lights off and facing my reflection in the window. I’m a beautiful woman. I look after myself. Why can’t he still love me? Why can’t our life have been as I’d hoped, as I’d wanted, after everything I’ve done for him? We have plenty of money. He has the career he dreamed of. I have only ever tried to be the perfect wife and give him the perfect life. Why can’t he let the past go?  
  
  I allow myself a few minutes’ more self-pity as I wipe down and polish the granite surfaces, and then I take a deep breath and pull myself together. I need to sleep. To properly sleep. I’ll take a pill and knock myself out. Tomorrow will be different. It has to be. I’ll forgive him. I always do.  
  
  I love my husband. I have since the moment I set eyes on him, and I will never fall out of love with him. I won’t give that up. I can’t.

  LOUISE  
  
  No names, okay? No jobs. No dull life talk. Let’s talk about real things.  
  
  ‘You really said that?’  
  
  ‘Yes. Well, no,’ I say. ‘He did.’  
  
  My face burns. It sounded romantic at four thirty in the afternoon two days ago with the first illicit afternoon Negroni, but now it’s like something from a cheap tragi-romcom. Thirty-four-year-old woman walks into a bar and is sweet-talked by the man of her dreams who turns out to be her new boss. Oh God, I want to die from the awfulness of it all. What a mess.  
  
  ‘Of course he did.’ Sophie laughs and immediately tries to stop herself. ‘No dull life talk. Like, oh, I don’t know, the small fact I’m married.’ She sees my face. ‘Sorry. I know it’s not technically funny, but it sort of is. And I know you’re out of practice with the whole men thing, but how could you not have known from that he was married? The new boss bit I’ll let you off with. That is simply bloody bad luck.’  
  
  ‘It’s really not funny,’ I say, but I smile. ‘Anyway, married men are your forte, not mine.’  
  
  ‘True.’  
  
  I knew Sophie would make me feel better. We are funny together. We laugh. She’s an actress by trade – although we never discuss how she hasn’t worked outside of two TV corpses in years – and, despite her affairs, has been married to a music exec for ever. We met at our NCT classes, and although our lives are very different, we bonded. Seven years on and we’re still drinking wine.  
  
  ‘But now you’re like me,’ she says, with a cheery wink. ‘Sleeping with a married man. I feel less bad about myself already.’  
  
  ‘I didn’t sleep with him. And I didn’t know he was married.’ That last part isn’t quite true. By the end of the night, I’d had a pretty good idea. The urgent press of his body against mine as we kissed, our heads spinning from gin. The sudden break away. The guilt in his eyes. The apology. I can’t do this. All the tells were there.  
  
  ‘Okay, Snow White. I’m just excited that you nearly got laid. How long’s it been now?’  
  
  ‘I really don’t want to think about that. Depressing me further won’t help with my current predicament,’ I say, before drinking more of my wine. I need another cigarette. Adam is tucked up and fast asleep and won’t move until breakfast and school. I can relax. He doesn’t have nightmares. He doesn’t sleepwalk. Thank God for small mercies.  
  
  ‘And this is all Michaela’s fault anyway,’ I continue. ‘If she’d cancelled before I got there, none of this would have happened.’  
  
  Sophie’s got a point though. It’s been a long time since I’ve even flirted with a man, let alone got drunk and kissed one. Her life is different. Always surrounded by new and interesting people. Creative types who live more freely, drink until late, and live like teenagers. Being a single mum in London eking out a living as a psychiatrist’s part-time secretary doesn’t exactly give me a huge number of opportunities to throw caution to the wind and go out every night in the hope of meeting anyone, let alone ‘Mr Right’, and I can’t face Tinder or Match or any of those other sites. I’ve kind of got used to being on my own. Putting all that on hold for a while. A while that is turning into an inadvertent lifestyle choice.  
  
  ‘This will cheer you up.’ She pulls a joint out of the top pocket of her red corduroy jacket. ‘Trust me, you’ll find everything funnier once we’re baked.’ She sees the reluctance on my face and grins. ‘Come on, Lou. It’s a special occasion. You’ve excelled yourself. Snogged your new married boss. This is genius. I should get someone to write the film. I could play you.’  
  
  ‘Good,’ I say. ‘I’ll need the money when I’m fired.’ I can’t fight Sophie, and I don’t want to, and soon we’re sitting out on the small balcony of my tiny flat, wine, crisps, and cigarettes at our feet, passing the weed between us, giggling.  
  
  Unlike Sophie, who somehow remains half-teenager, getting high is not in any way part of my normal routine – there isn’t the time or the money when you’re on your own – but laughter beats crying any time, and I suck in a lungful of sweet, forbidden smoke.  
  
  ‘It could only happen to you,’ she says. ‘You hid?’  
  
  I nod, smiling at the comedy of the memory imagined through someone else’s eyes. ‘I couldn’t think of anything else to do. I dived into the toilet and stayed there. When I came out, he’d gone. He doesn’t start until tomorrow. He was getting the full tour from Dr Sykes.’  
  
  ‘With his wife.’  
  
  ‘Yep, with his wife.’ I remember how good they looked together in that brief, awful moment of realisation. A beautiful couple.  
  
  ‘How long did you stay in the toilet for?’  
  
  ‘Twenty minutes.’  
  
  ‘Oh, Lou.’  
  
  There’s a pause, and then we both have the giggles, wine and weed buzzing our heads, and for a little while we can’t stop.  
  
  ‘I wish I could have seen your face,’ Sophie says.  
  
  ‘Yeah, well, I’m not looking forward to seeing his face when he sees my face.’  
  
  Sophie shrugs. ‘He’s the married one. It’s his shame. He can’t say anything to you.’  
  
  She absolves me of my guilt, but I can still feel it clinging, along with the shock. The gut punch of the woman I’d glimpsed by his side before I dashed into hiding. His beautiful wife. Elegant. Dark-haired and olive-skinned in an Angelina Jolie way. That kind of mystery about her. Exceptionally slim. The opposite of me. The snapshot of her is burned into my brain. I couldn’t imagine her ever panicking and hiding in a toilet from anyone. It stung in a way it shouldn’t have, not after one drunken afternoon, and not only because my confidence has reached rock bottom.  
  
  The thing is, I’d liked him – really liked him. I can’t tell Sophie about that. How I hadn’t talked to anyone like that in a long time. How happy I’d felt to be flirting with someone who was flirting back, and how I’d forgotten how great that excitement of something potentially new was. My life is, as a rule, a blur of endless routine. I get Adam up and take him to school. If I’m working and want to start early, he goes to breakfast club. If I’m not working, I may spend an hour or so browsing charity shops for designer cast-offs that will fit the clinic’s subtly expensive look. Then it’s just cooking, cleaning, shopping, until Adam comes home, and then it’s homework, tea, bath, story, bed for him and wine and bad sleep for me. When he goes to his dad’s for a weekend I’m too tired to do anything much other than lie in and then watch crap TV. The idea that this could be my life until Adam’s at least fifteen or so quietly terrifies me, so I don’t think about it. But then meeting the man-in-the-bar made me remember how good it was to feel something. As a woman. It made me feel alive. I’d even thought about going back to that bar and seeing if he’d turned up to find me. But, of course, life isn’t a romcom. And he’s married. And I’ve been an idiot. I’m not bitter, merely sad. I can’t tell Sophie any of these things because then she’d feel sorry for me, and I don’t want that, and it’s just easier to find it all funny. It is funny. And it’s not like I sit at h  
ome bemoaning my singledom every night, as if no one could ever be complete without a man. In the main, I’m pretty happy. I’m a grown-up. I could have it way worse. This was one mistake. I have to deal with it.  
  
  I scoop up a handful of Doritos and Sophie does the same.  
  
  ‘Curves are the new thin,’ we say in unison, before cramming the crisps into our mouths and nearly choking as we laugh again. I think about me hiding in the toilet from him, full of panic and disbelief. It is funny. Everything is funny. It might be less funny tomorrow morning when I have to face the music, but for now I can laugh. If you can’t laugh at your own fuck-ups, what can you laugh at?  
  
  ‘Why do you do it?’ I say later, when the bottle of wine is empty between us and the evening is drawing to a close. ‘Have affairs? Aren’t you happy with Jay?’  
  
  ‘Of course I am,’ Sophie says. ‘I love him. It’s not like I’m out doing it all the time.’  
  
  This is probably true. She’s an actress; she exaggerates for the sake of a story sometimes.  
  
  ‘But why do it at all?’ Strangely, it’s not something we’ve really talked about that much. She knows I’m uncomfortable with it, not because she does it – that’s her business – but because I know and like Jay. He’s good for her. Without him, she’d be screwed. As it were.  
I have a higher sex drive than he does,’ she says, eventually. ‘And sex isn’t what marriage is about anyway. It’s about being with your best friend. Jay’s my best friend. But we’ve been together fifteen years. Lust can’t maintain itself. I mean, we still do it, sometimes, but it’s not like it was. And having a child changes things. You spend so many years seeing each other as parents rather than lovers, it’s hard to get that passion back.’  
  
  I think of my own short-lived marriage. The lust didn’t die with us. But that didn’t stop him leaving after four years to be with someone else when our son was barely two years old. Maybe she has a point. I don’t think I ever saw my ex, Ian, as my best friend.  
  
  ‘It just seems a bit sad to me.’ And it does.  
  
  ‘That’s because you believe in true love and happy ever after in a fairy tale way. That’s not how life is.’  
  
  ‘Do you think he’s ever cheated on you?’ I ask.  
  
  ‘He’s definitely had his flirtations,’ she says. ‘There was a singer he worked with a long time ago. I think maybe they had a thing for a while. But whatever it was, it didn’t affect us. Not really.’  
  
  She makes it sound so reasonable. All I can think of is the pain of betrayal I felt when Ian left. How what he did affected how I saw myself. How worthless I felt in those early days. How ugly. The short-lived romance he left me for didn’t last either, but that didn’t make me feel better.  
  
  ‘I don’t think I’ll ever understand it,’ I say.  
  
  ‘Everyone has secrets, Lou,’ she says. ‘Everyone should be allowed their secrets. You can never know everything about a person. You’d go mad trying to.’  
  
  I wonder, after she’s left and I’m cleaning up the debris of our evening, if maybe Jay was the one who cheated first. Maybe that’s Sophie’s secret at the heart of her hotel-room trysts. Maybe it’s all done to make herself feel better or to quietly get even. Who knows? I’m probably over-thinking it. Over-thinking is my speciality. Each to their own, I remind myself. She seems happy and that’s good enough for me.  
  
  It’s only a little past ten thirty, but I’m exhausted, and I peer in at Adam for a minute, a soothing comfort to be found in watching his peaceful sleep, curled up tiny on his side under his Star Wars duvet, Paddington tucked under one arm, and then close the door and leave him to it.  
  
  It’s dark when I wake up in the bathroom, standing in front of the mirror, and before I’ve really registered where I am, I feel the sharp throb in my shin where I’ve walked into the small laundry basket in the corner. My heart races, and sweat clings to my hairline. As reality settles around me, the night terror shatters, leaving only fragments in my head. I know what it was though. Always the same dream.  
  
  A vast building, like an old hospital or orphanage. Abandoned. Adam is trapped somewhere inside it, and I know, I just know, that if I can’t get to him, then he’s going to die. He’s calling out for me, afraid. Something bad is coming for him. I’m running through corridors trying to reach him, and from the walls and ceilings the shadows stretch, as if they’re part of some terrible evil alive in the building, and wrap themselves around me, trapping me. All I can hear is Adam crying as I try to escape the dark, sticky strands determined to keep me from him, to choke me and drag me into the endless darkness. It’s a horrible dream. It clings to me like the shadows do in the nightmare itself. The details may change slightly from night to night, but the narrative is always the same. However many times I have it, I’ll never get used to it.  
  
  The night terrors didn’t start when Adam was born – I’ve always had them, but before him I would be fighting for my own survival. Looking back, that was better, even if I didn’t know it at the time. They’re the bane of my life. They kill my chances of a decent night’s sleep when being a single mum tires me out enough.  
  
  This time I’ve walked more than I’ve done in a while. Normally I wake up, confused, standing either by my own bed or Adam’s, often in the middle of a nonsensical, terrified sentence. It happens so often it doesn’t even bother him if he wakes up any more. But then he’s got his father’s practicality. Thankfully, he’s my sense of humour.  
  
  I put the light on, look into the mirror, and groan. Dark circles drag the skin under my eyes down, and I know foundation isn’t going to cover them. Not in full daylight. Oh good. I remind myself that it doesn’t matter what the-man-from-the-bar aka oh-crap-he’s-my-new-married-boss thinks of me. Hopefully, he’ll be feeling embarrassed enough to ignore me all day. My stomach still clenches though, and my head thumps from too much wine and too many cigarettes. Woman up, I tell myself. It’ll all be forgotten in a day or so. Just go in and do your job.  
  
  It’s only four in the morning, and I drink some water, then turn the light out and creep back to my own bed hoping at least to doze until the alarm goes off at six. I refuse to think about the way his mouth felt on mine and how good it was, if only briefly, to have that surge of desire. To feel that connection with someone. I stare at the wall and contemplate counting sheep, and then I realise that under my nerves I’m also excited to see him again. I grit my teeth and curse myself as an idiot. I am not that woman.

  ADELE  
  
  I wave him off with a smile as he leaves for his first proper day at the clinic, and the elderly lady next door looks on approvingly as she takes her small, equally frail dog out for his walk. We always appear such a perfect couple, David and I. I like that.  
  
  Still, I let out a sigh of relief when I close the door and have the house to myself, even though that exhalation feels like a small betrayal. I love having David here with me, but we’re not yet back on whatever even ground we’ve created for ourselves, and the atmosphere is full of everything unsaid. Thankfully, the new house is big enough that he can hide in his study and we can pretend everything is fine as we cautiously move around each other.  
  
  I do, however, feel slightly better than I did when he came home drunk. We didn’t discuss it the next morning, of course; discussion is not something we do these days. Instead, I left him to his papers and went to sign us both up at the local health club, which is suitably expensive, and then walked around our new chic area, absorbing it all. I like to lock locations in place. To be able to see them. It makes me feel more comfortable. It helps me relax.  
  
  I walked for nearly two hours, mentally logging shops and bars and restaurants until I had them safely stored in my head, their images summonable at will, and then I bought some bread from the local artisan bakery, and some olives, sliced ham, hummus, and sun-dried tomatoes from the deli – all of which were decadently expensive and drained my housekeeping cash – and made us an indoor picnic for lunch, even though it was warm enough to sit outside. I don’t think he wants to go into the garden yet.  
  
  Yesterday we went to the clinic, and I charmed the senior partner Dr Sykes, and the various other doctors and nurses we met. People respond to beauty. It sounds vain, but it’s true. David once told me that jurors were far more likely to believe good-looking people in the dock than average or ugly ones. It’s only the luck of skin and bones, but I’ve learned that it does have a magic. You don’t even have to say very much, but simply listen and smile, and people bend over backwards for you. I have enjoyed being beautiful. To say anything else would be a lie. I work hard to keep myself beautiful for David. Everything I do is for him.  
  
  David’s new office is the second largest in the building from what I could see, the sort I would expect him to have if he’d ever take up a position in Harley Street. The carpet is cream and plush, the large desk is suitably ostentatious, and outside is a very luxurious reception area. The blonde and attractive – if you like that sort of thing – woman behind that desk scurried away before we could be introduced, which annoyed me – but Dr Sykes barely seemed to notice as he talked at me and blushed when I laughed at his terrible half-jokes. I think I did very well given how much my heart was aching. David must have been pleased too, because he softened a little after that.  
  
  We are having dinner at Dr Sykes’ h  
ouse tonight as an informal welcome. I already have my dress picked out and know how I will do my hair. I fully intend to make David proud of me. I can be the good wife. The new partner’s wife. Despite my present worries. I feel calmer than I have since we moved.  
  
  I look up at the clock whose tick cuts through the vast silence in the house. It’s still only eight a.m. He’s probably just getting to the office now. He won’t make his first call home until eleven thirty. I have time. I go up to our bedroom and lie on top of the covers. I’m not going to sleep. But I do close my eyes. I think about the clinic. David’s office. That plush cream carpet. The polished mahogany of his desk. The tiny scratch on the corner. The two slim couches. Firm seats. The details. I take a deep breath.

  LOUISE  
  
  ‘You look lovely today,’ Sue says, almost surprised, as I take off my coat and hang it in the staffroom. Adam said the same thing – in the same tone – his small face mildly confused by my silk blouse, new to me from the charity shop, and straightened hair as I shoved toast into his hand before we left for school this morning. Oh God, I’ve made an obvious effort, and I know it. But it’s not for him. If anything it’s against him. War paint. Something to hide behind. Also, I couldn’t get back to sleep and I needed something to do.  
  
  Normally, on mornings like this, I’d take Adam to breakfast club and then be first at the clinic and have everyone’s coffee on before they got in. But today, was, of course, one of those days when Adam woke up grumpy and whining about everything, and then couldn’t find his left shoe, and then even though I’d been ready for ages, it was still an irritated rush to get to the school gates on time.  
  
  My palms are sweating and I feel a bit sick as I smile. I also smoked three cigarettes on the walk from the school to the clinic. Normally I try not to have any until coffee break time. Well, I say normally. In my head I don’t have any until coffee, in reality I’ve usually smoked one on my way in.  
  
  ‘Thanks. Adam’s at his dad’s this weekend so I might go for a drink after work.’ I might need a drink after work. I make a note to text Sophie and see if she wants to meet. Of course she will. She’ll be itching to see how this comedy of errors turns out. I try and make it sound casual, but my voice sounds funny to me. I need to pull myself together. I’m being ridiculous. It’s going to be way worse for him than it is for me. I’m not the married one. The pep talk sentences may be true, but they don’t change the fact that I don’t do these things. This is not normal for me like maybe it is for Sophie, and I feel totally sick. I’m a mess of jittering emotions that can’t settle on one thing. This situation may not be my fault, but I feel cheap and stupid and guilty and angry. The first moment of potential romance I’ve had in what feels like for ever and it was fool’s gold. And yet, despite all that, and the memory of his beautiful wife, I also have a nugget of excitement at the prospect of seeing him again. I’m like a ditzy, dithering teenager.  
  
  ‘They’re all in a meeting until 10.30, or so Elaine upstairs tells me,’ she says. ‘We can relax.’ She opens her bag. ‘And I didn’t forget it was my turn.’ She pulls out two greasy paper bags. ‘Friday bacon butties.’  
  
  I’m so relieved that I’ve got a couple of hours’ reprieve, that I take it happily, even though it’s an indication of how mind-numbing my life routine is that this Friday breakfast is a highlight of my week. But still, it is bacon. Some parts of a routine are less demoralising than others. I take a large bite, enjoying the buttery warm bread and salty meat. I’m a nervous eater. Actually, I’m an eater whatever my mood. Nervous eating, comfort eating, happy eating. It’s all the same. Other people get divorced and lose a stone. It worked the other way for me.  
  
  We don’t officially start work for another twenty minutes, so we sit at the small table with mugs of tea, and Sue tells me about her husband’s arthritis and the gay couple next door to their house who seem to be constantly having sex, and I smile and let it wash over me and try not to jump every time I see someone’s shadow fall across the doorway from the corridor.  
  
  I don’t see the ketchup drop until it’s too late and there’s a bright red dollop on my cream blouse right on my chest. Sue is there immediately, fussing and dabbing at it with tissues and then a damp cloth, but all she achieves is to make a great chunk of the material see-through and there’s still a pale outline of washed-out red. My face is over-heating, and the silk clings to my back. This is the precursor for the rest of the day. I can feel it.  
  
  I laugh away her well-meaning attempts to clean me up and go to the toilet and try and get as much of my shirt under the hand dryer as possible. It doesn’t dry it totally, but at least the lace trim of my bra – slightly grey from the wash – is no longer visible. Small mercies.  
  
  I have to laugh at myself. Who am I kidding? I can’t do this. I’m more at home discussing the latest storyline of Rescue Bots or Horrid Henry with Adam than trying to look like a modern, sophisticated woman. My feet are already aching in my two-inch heels. I always thought it was something you grew into, that ability to walk perfectly in high heels and always dress well. As it turns out – for me anyway – there was a small phase of that in the nightclubbing years of my twenties, and now it’s mainly jeans and jumpers and Converse with a ponytail, accessorised with life-envy of those who can still be bothered to make the effort. Life-envy of those with a reason to make the effort.  
  
  I bet she wears high heels, I think as I adjust my clothes. More fool me for not sticking with trousers and flats.  
  
  The phones are quiet this morning, and I distract myself from the clock ticking steadily around to ten thirty by highlighting the case files on the system for Monday’s appointments, and making a list of those coming up in the rest of the week. For some – the more complex cases – he already has copies of their notes, but I want to be seen as efficient, so I make sure the full list is found. Then I print out the various emails that I think might be valuable or important or forgotten by the management, and then also print out and laminate a list of contact numbers for the hospital and police and various other organisations that he might need. It’s actually quite calming. The-man-from-the-bar is fading in my head and being replaced with my-boss, even if his face is mashing up rather alarmingly with old Dr Cadigan, who he’s replaced.  
  
  At ten, I go and put the print-outs on his desk and turn the coffee machine on in the corner so there will be a fresh pot waiting. I check that the cleaners have put fresh milk in the small fridge hidden in a cabinet like a hotel mini-bar, and that there’s sugar in the bowl. After that, I can’t help but look at the silver-framed photos on his desk. There are three. Two of his wife standing alone, and an old one of them together. This one draws me in and I pick up it. He looks so different. So young. He can only be maybe early twenties at most. They’re sitting on a large kitchen table and have their arms wrapped around each other and are laughing at something. They look so happy, both so young and carefree. His eyes are locked on her as if she’s the most important thing on the whole planet. Her hair is long, but not pulled back in a bun as it is in the other pictures, and even in jeans and a T-shirt she’s effortlessly beautiful. My stomach knots. I bet she never drops ketchup on her top.  
  
  ‘Hello?’  
  
  I’m so startled when I hear the slight Scottish brogue that I almost drop the photo, and I struggle to straighten it on the desk, nearly unbalancing the neat pile of papers and sending them tumbling to the floor. He’s standing in the doorway, and I immediately want to throw up my bacon roll. Oh God, I’d forgotten how good-looking he is. Almost-blond hair with a shine I’d kill for on my own. Long enough at the front to be able to run your fingers through it, but still smart. Blue eyes that go right through you. Skin you just want to touch. I swallow hard. He’s one of those men. A breathtaking man. My face is burning.  
  
  ‘You’re supposed to be in a meeting until ten thirty,’ I say, wishing a hole would open in the carpet and suck me down to shame hell. I’m in his office looking at pictures of his wife like some kind of stalker. Oh God.  
/>   ‘Oh God,’ he says, stealing the words right out from my head. The colour drains from his face and his eyes widen. He looks shocked and stunned and terrified all rolled into one. ‘It’s you.’  
  
  ‘Look,’ I say, ‘it was really nothing and we were drunk and got carried away and it was only a kiss, and, trust me, I have no intention of telling anyone about it, and I think if we both do our best to forget it ever happened then there’s no reason we can’t just get along and no one will ever know …’ The words are coming out in a gibbering rush and I can’t stop them. I can feel sweat trapped under my foundation as I fluster and overheat.  
  
  ‘But’ – he’s looking somewhere between confused and alarmed as he quickly closes the door behind him and I can’t blame him – ‘what are you doing here?’  
  
  ‘Oh.’ In all my rambling, I’ve forgotten to say the obvious. ‘I’m your secretary and receptionist. Three days a week, anyway. Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. I was putting some things on your desk and I saw …’ I nod to the pictures. ‘I, well …’ The sentence drains away.

# Chapter 1: The Guam Incident

**Location: Joint Region Marianas Military Base, Guam** **Time: Few hours after the Battle of San Francisco**

The interrogation room is stark white under fluorescent lighting. British mercenary and eco-terrorist **Alan Jonah** sits cuffed to a metal chair, his weathered face showing no emotion as American military officials fire questions at him. Hours of interrogation have yielded nothing - Jonah remains silent, occasionally smirking at his captors' growing frustration.

""We know you were involved with the radiological materials theft in Nevada,"" Colonel Hayes leans forward across the table. ""We know you have connections to the kaiju incidents.""

Jonah's only response is a slight tilt of his head, as if listening to something the others can't hear.

Then the base begins to shake.

At first, it's subtle - coffee cups rattling on desks, fluorescent lights swaying on their chains. The interrogation pauses as everyone looks up, confused. Earthquakes are rare in Guam, but not impossible.

Then the tremors become rhythmic. Deliberate.

**Footsteps.**

The emergency klaxons begin wailing as Godzilla's massive form rises from Apra Harbor like a prehistoric mountain. Seawater cascades from his scarred hide as he surveys the military installation with those ancient yellow eyes. His tongue flicks out, tasting the air for radiation signatures that have drawn him here - nuclear submarines, weapons storage, the electromagnetic residue left by his recent battles.

**He's come to feed.**

Godzilla moves toward the base's nuclear storage facility with the methodical purpose of a predator who has found a rich feeding ground. His massive claws tear through the reinforced barriers like tissue paper, revealing the uranium cores within. He lowers his massive head, his atomic breath drawing the radioactive material into his system like a whale filter-feeding.

But he's not alone.

The ground splits open with a sound like the world cracking in half. Concrete runways buckle and fold as something massive burrows up from the depths beneath the base. **MUTO Prime** \- the Jinshin-Mushi, Earthquake Beetle - emerges with the terrible majesty of a creature that has been **hunting** him.

She has followed his radiation trail across the Pacific, tracking every nuclear facility he's visited, every submarine he's consumed. While Godzilla has been feeding to recover from the San Francisco battle, she has been **stalking** him.

She is larger than either of the 2014 MUTOs, her armored carapace gleaming with bioluminescent patterns that pulse like a heartbeat. Four massive arms end in claws designed for digging through solid rock, while her back legs are built for crushing and gripping. Most terrifying of all are her eyes - intelligent, calculating, filled with an alien hunger that sees Godzilla not as territory to defend against, but as **prey to be claimed**.

# The First Confrontation

Godzilla turns toward this new threat, his head tilting with reptilian confusion. He's never encountered anything like her before - not during his decades of hibernation, not in his recent emergence. His Komodo dragon instincts recognize a fellow apex predator, but everything else about her is **alien**.

Her four massive arms, her bioluminescent communication patterns, her electromagnetic field - none of it matches anything in his genetic memory. **This is completely unknown prey. Or is he the prey?**

His dorsal fins begin to glow with that familiar blue light as he prepares his atomic breath, falling back on his most reliable weapon when facing the unknown.

MUTO Prime moves with surprising speed for something so massive, her four arms propelling her forward in a scuttling charge. But this isn't the desperate maternal fury of the Female MUTO - this is calculated aggression from a creature that has killed titans before.

Her four massive claws rake across Godzilla's chest in a coordinated assault, each strike precise and calculated. The wounds are deep, weeping radioactive blood that hisses as it hits the concrete below. But MUTO Prime's true weapon isn't her claws - it's the focused electromagnetic pulse that erupts from her carapace like invisible lightning.

The pulse hits Godzilla's nervous system like a sledgehammer. His atomic breath, already building in his throat, misfires catastrophically. Blue plasma sprays in all directions, melting aircraft and setting fuel depots ablaze. His massive form staggers, crushing a hangar like cardboard as his motor functions scramble.

MUTO Prime circles him with the patience of a true predator, her bioluminescent patterns pulsing in hypnotic sequences. She's studying his recovery time, measuring his vulnerability window. Four arms spread wide, she moves with the scuttling grace of something born to hunt in darkness.

But Godzilla's Komodo dragon heritage serves him well. Even disoriented, his predatory instincts kick in. He doesn't try to stand - instead, he rolls, using his massive bulk as a weapon. His tail sweeps in a devastating arc that catches MUTO Prime across her armored legs.

The impact sends shockwaves through the base as the Jinshin-Mushi is launched sideways into the communications tower. Steel and concrete explode in a shower of debris, but her carapace absorbs the worst of it. She rolls with the impact, already calculating her next strike.

**This isn't a battle - it's a chess match played with claws and atomic fire.**

She rolls with the impact, her armored shell protecting her from the worst of the damage, then scuttles backward toward the harbor. Her bioluminescent patterns pulse in complex sequences - some form of communication, perhaps. A taunt. A promise.

**She's not retreating. She's studying him.**

With a sound like grinding tectonic plates, MUTO Prime burrows back into the earth, leaving only a massive crater where the base's command center used to be. Godzilla watches her disappear, his yellow eyes tracking the seismic disturbances as she moves through the bedrock beneath the ocean floor.

Then he too slips beneath the waves, following her electromagnetic signature as it fades into the deep Pacific.

# Chapter 2: The Investigation

**Location: Monarch Facility, Classified Location** **Time: 24 hours after Guam incident**

The aftermath of Guam sends shockwaves through every government agency involved in kaiju monitoring. Two titans engaged in combat on American soil, causing millions in damage and revealing the existence of a previously unknown alpha predator.

**Dr. Emma Russell** stands before a wall of monitors displaying satellite footage, seismic readouts, and classified military reports. Her hands tremble slightly as she grips her coffee cup - three days without sleep, haunted by the images from San Francisco. The screaming. The radiation burns. Her son Andrew's school calling to confirm he was among the casualties at the Golden Gate Bridge.

Every fiber of her being wants to walk away, to grieve, to blame Godzilla for the destruction. But her scientific mind recognizes something more terrifying than random kaiju violence - **intelligence**. Purpose. A predator that makes Godzilla look like prey.

""The electromagnetic signature is unlike anything we've recorded,"" she explains to the assembled team, her voice barely steady. ""The 2014 MUTOs generated EMPs as a defensive mechanism, but this... this is weaponized. Targeted. It's actively hunting Godzilla."" She pauses, swallowing the bile that rises when she thinks of defending the monster that killed her child. ""And if something is hunting **him**, we need to understand what we're really dealing with.""

Colonel Foster, one of the few survivors from Guam, nods grimly. ""The creature seemed to know exactly where to strike. It wasn't random destruction - it was surgical. It wanted to test Godzilla's capabilities.""

Dr. Serizawa, recently recruited to Monarch's expanded kaiju research division, notices Emma's barely controlled fury as she studies the footage. The way her jaw clenches when Godzilla appears on screen. The way she forces herself to analyze the creature that murdered her son with clinical detachment.

""In Japanese mythology, the Jinshin-Mushi was known as the Earthquake Beetle - a creature that could split the earth itself,"" Serizawa says gently. ""But the legends spoke of it as a parasite, something that fed on other titans.""

Emma's laugh is bitter, hollow. ""Good. Let it feed on Godzilla. Let it tear him apart from the inside."" She catches herself, forces her scientific objectivity back into place. ""But if this creature is actively hunting Godzilla, we need to understand why. What makes him different from other potential prey?"" *What makes him worth protecting when he killed my son?*

Emma pulls up enhanced satellite imagery showing the massive tunnel system MUTO Prime left beneath Guam, her scientific training warring with her maternal grief. Every data point she analyzes brings her closer to understanding the monster that killed Andrew - and possibly finding a way to destroy it.

The answer comes from an unexpected source. Deep-sea monitoring stations across the Pacific begin registering massive seismic disturbances moving at incredible speed beneath the ocean floor. MUTO Prime isn't just hunting - she's herding Godzilla, driving him toward something.

""She's not trying to kill him quickly,"" Emma realizes, her voice cracking slightly. ""She's... she's playing with him. Like he played with us."" The parallel hits too close to home - Godzilla's casual destruction of the bridge, Andrew's school bus tossed aside like a toy. Now something else sees Godzilla as prey to be toyed with.

A desperate decision is made to deploy Emma's team to Japan, following ancient legends and seismic data that suggest MUTO Prime's hunting ground has historical precedent. Emma volunteers immediately - not out of scientific curiosity, but from a mother's need for answers about the forces that destroyed her world.

# Chapter 3: Revelations in Japan

**Location: Ancient Titan Graveyard, Rural Japan** **Time: 3 days after Guam incident**

The elderly Japanese man who contacted Monarch introduces himself simply as **Kenji Yamane** \- a descendant of paleontologists who studied kaiju remains in the 1950s. His property sits atop what appears to be a recent earthquake fissure, but Emma's equipment reveals something far more significant.

""My grandfather documented strange findings after the Pacific nuclear tests,"" Yamane explains, leading Emma's team toward the massive crack in the earth. ""Titan remains that didn't match any known species. Bones that showed evidence of... infestation.""

The fissure descends deep into the earth, revealing a natural cavern system that has been sealed for decades. Emma's team rappels down into the darkness, their radiation detectors clicking steadily as they descend.

What they find defies comprehension.

# The Dagon Discovery

The cavern opens into a vast underground chamber, its walls covered in bioluminescent fungus that provides an eerie blue-green glow. But dominating the space is a skeleton of impossible proportions - a titan's remains, but unlike anything in Monarch's databases.

""Godzilla species,"" Dr. Chen whispers, studying the bone structure. ""But different. Older.""

Emma approaches the skull, her equipment detecting residual radiation signatures in the ancient bones. ""This is Dagon,"" she breathes. ""The titan from the cave paintings we found in the Philippines. But look at this...""

The skeleton shows clear signs of parasitic infestation. Holes bored through the ribcage, empty egg sacs still visible within the chest cavity where the 2014 MUTOs gestated for decades before hatching. The bones are fossilized but well-preserved, a monument to MUTO Prime's ancient victory.

""She used him as an incubator,"" Emma realizes with growing horror, though part of her feels a dark satisfaction knowing that Godzilla's species has suffered loss too. ""The MUTOs we fought in 2014 - they were born from Dagon's corpse."" She stares at the ancient bones, thinking of Andrew's small body somewhere beneath San Francisco Bay. ""At least this one got a tomb. At least someone mourned him.""

# The Flashback - 1954

*The chamber seems to shimmer, and Emma finds herself witnessing events from sixty years past...*

*Two massive forms circle each other in an ancient ritual of combat.* ***Dagon****, nearly identical to the modern Godzilla but bearing different scars, faces off against MUTO Prime in her terrible glory. This is not their first encounter - old wounds on both creatures speak of a rivalry spanning millennia.*

*But Dagon is weakened. Recent nuclear testing has disrupted his hibernation, leaving him disoriented and vulnerable. MUTO Prime recognizes opportunity when she sees it.*

*The battle is brief but brutal. MUTO Prime's electromagnetic pulses disrupt Dagon's atomic breath, while her four massive claws pin him to the cavern floor. Then comes the true horror - her ovipositor extends like a nightmare medical instrument, boring into Dagon's chest to deposit her eggs directly into his radioactive organs.*

*Dagon's roars of pain echo through the chamber as MUTO Prime completes her parasitic reproduction. But she doesn't kill him. Instead, she seals him in this underground tomb, allowing her offspring to gestate within his still-living body while he remains conscious but helpless.*

*The eggs that would eventually hatch into the 2014 MUTOs were born from Dagon's prolonged suffering.*

*The vision ends as the chamber shakes violently.*

# MUTO Prime's Return

MUTO Prime bursts through the cavern wall with the force of an earthquake, her massive form filling the chamber as rocks rain down from the ceiling. Emma's team scrambles for cover as the Earthquake Beetle advances on Dagon's remains - not to feed, but to communicate.

Her bioluminescent patterns pulse in complex sequences as she examines Dagon's remains - not with nostalgia, but with the calculating assessment of a farmer checking her previous harvest. The empty egg chambers within his ribcage are testament to her successful reproduction cycle.

""She's not just a parasite,"" Emma realizes as she and her team flee through collapsing tunnels, her voice mixing scientific awe with personal hatred. ""She's a **farmer**. She uses titan corpses as incubators, then moves on to find new hosts when they're depleted."" *Just like Godzilla used my son's school bus - a tool to be discarded when no longer useful.*

Emma's tears mix with the dust and debris as they escape, but whether they're from grief for her son or relief that something might finally make Godzilla pay, she can't tell anymore.

The team barely escapes as MUTO Prime's electromagnetic pulse brings down the entire cavern system. Behind them, the ancient titan graveyard becomes a tomb once more, but Emma knows the truth now - MUTO Prime isn't just hunting Godzilla.

**She's preparing to farm him.**

# Chapter 4: The Siberian Connection

**Location: Russian Nuclear Submarine, Pacific Ocean** **Time: 5 days after Guam incident**

The Russian submarine **Kursk II** detected the electromagnetic anomalies three days ago, but Captain Volkov chose to investigate rather than report to his superiors. The potential military applications of a creature that could disable electronic systems globally were too valuable to share with other nations.

What he didn't realize is that he was witnessing a **hunt in progress**.

Godzilla had been feeding on a disabled Japanese nuclear transport vessel when the Russian submarine arrived. The kaiju's massive form was half-submerged, his atomic breath drawing radioactive fuel rods into his system like a massive straw. His feeding created electromagnetic disturbances that the submarine's sensors interpreted as some kind of new weapon technology.

Now, as his submarine sits dead in the water with all systems fried, Volkov realizes his mistake. The electromagnetic pulse didn't come from Godzilla - it came from something **hunting** Godzilla.

MUTO Prime rises from the oceanic depths like a living mountain, her bioluminescent patterns reflecting off the submarine's hull in alien geometries. She has been tracking Godzilla's feeding patterns, following the radiation signatures he leaves behind, learning his habits.

**She's been herding him toward this confrontation.**

Godzilla's massive form breaks the surface nearby, drawn by the submarine's nuclear reactor, unaware that he's walking into a carefully prepared ambush. His feeding has made him predictable, and MUTO Prime has exploited that weakness.

# The Ocean Battle - Depths of Savagery

The battle takes place in the crushing darkness of the deep Pacific, illuminated only by bioluminescent displays and the blue glow of Godzilla's atomic breath. Here, MUTO Prime reveals her true nature as an apex predator of the depths.

She strikes from below like a massive spider, her four arms wrapping around Godzilla's torso in a death embrace. Her claws seek the soft tissue between his dorsal plates, probing for vital organs with surgical precision. But this isn't just a grapple - it's preparation for parasitization. Her ovipositor extends like a nightmare medical instrument, seeking an entry point.

Godzilla's response is pure Komodo dragon fury. He doesn't try to break free - he uses her grip against her. Rolling in the water with tremendous force, he slams MUTO Prime against the ocean floor with bone-crushing impact. The seafloor cracks under the pressure, sending up clouds of sediment that turn the water black.

But MUTO Prime is built for this environment. Her carapace deflects the worst of the impact while her electromagnetic field disorients Godzilla's lateral line system - his ability to sense movement in the water. Blind and disoriented, he swings wildly, his claws raking empty ocean.

The Earthquake Beetle uses his confusion to her advantage. She latches onto his back, her four arms providing incredible leverage as she attempts to position her ovipositor at the base of his skull. One successful penetration and she can inject paralytic agents directly into his brain stem.

Godzilla's survival instincts kick in with primal desperation. His atomic breath charges not in his throat, but throughout his entire body. Every dorsal plate begins to glow like blue stars as he prepares to irradiate everything around him - including himself if necessary.

The underwater atomic pulse is devastating. Superheated water expands explosively, creating a pressure wave that could crush submarines. MUTO Prime's electromagnetic field provides some protection, but the sheer thermal energy forces her to release her grip and retreat into the abyssal depths.

**Both creatures surface, wounded and wary. This was round two - and both know the final round will be to the death.**

# The Clue

In the aftermath, as Russian rescue vessels arrive to collect the disabled submarine, Emma's team discovers something crucial. Jonah's cracked phone, recovered from the Guam incident, contained GPS coordinates pointing to locations across the globe - including the exact coordinates where MUTO Prime just attacked.

""He's been tracking titan movements,"" Emma realizes. ""But how did he know where they'd be?""

The answer lies in the phone's damaged SIM card, which reveals communications with research facilities in Siberia - specifically, a geological survey station that has been monitoring seismic anomalies near the Tunguska event site.

# Chapter 5: The Tunguska Revelation

**Location: Siberian Wilderness, Russia** **Time: 7 days after Guam incident**

The helicopter flight over the Siberian wilderness reveals the true scope of MUTO Prime's activities. What appeared to be natural geological formations are actually massive tunnel systems, carved through solid rock with precision that suggests intelligence rather than instinct.

Emma's team, now accompanied by Russian military escorts, rappels into the largest tunnel entrance. Their radiation detectors go haywire immediately - the walls themselves are contaminated with an unknown form of radioactive material that doesn't match any known isotope.

""It's organic,"" Dr. Chen reports, taking readings from the tunnel walls. ""These aren't natural rock formations. They're... excretions. Hardened secretions from some kind of massive organism.""

The tunnels lead deep underground, eventually opening into a vast chamber that serves as MUTO Prime's primary nest. But this isn't just a lair - it's a **laboratory**.

# Jonah's Revelation

They find **Alan Jonah** in the deepest chamber, not as a prisoner but as a willing collaborator. He's been studying MUTO Prime's behavior, documenting her intelligence and strategic capabilities with the cold fascination of a true believer in titan supremacy.

""You don't understand what you're witnessing,"" Jonah explains as Emma's team surrounds him. ""This isn't just predation. This is **evolution**. MUTO Prime represents the next stage of titan development - a species that doesn't just coexist with radiation, but actively **cultivates** it.""

Emma realizes the horrible truth as she studies Jonah's research, her scientific objectivity crumbling under the weight of personal loss and mounting horror. MUTO Prime isn't just a parasite - she's a **titan farmer**, using kaiju corpses as incubators for her offspring while seeking new, living hosts to continue her reproductive cycle.

""Dagon wasn't her victim,"" Emma whispers, her voice hollow with the recognition that even titans can be prey. ""He was her **breeding ground**. And now she wants Godzilla as her next host.""

For a moment, she feels a savage satisfaction at the thought of the monster that killed Andrew meeting such a fate. But then the larger implications hit her - if MUTO Prime succeeds, if she breeds successfully using Godzilla's corpse, the offspring will be stronger, more numerous, and humanity will face something far worse than one rampaging kaiju.

Emma forces herself to focus on the data, swallowing her grief and rage. Andrew's death will mean nothing if she lets her personal feelings compromise the mission. But every calculation, every analysis, every moment spent working to understand these creatures is a battle against the part of her that wants to let them all destroy each other.

# The Dagon Truth

Jonah's files reveal the most disturbing truth of all. MUTO Prime has been using Dagon's corpse as an incubation chamber for decades. The 2014 MUTOs weren't random parasites - they were her **offspring**, gestated within Dagon's radioactive remains until they were ready to emerge and find their own mates.

""She doesn't need to keep her hosts alive,"" Emma realizes. ""She just needs them to be **radioactive**. Dagon's corpse provided the perfect breeding environment, and now she wants Godzilla to be her next incubator.""

The chamber shakes as seismic sensors detect MUTO Prime's return. But she's coming alone - Dagon served his purpose sixty years ago, and all that remains of him now are bones picked clean by time and parasites.

Emma's team barely escapes as the Siberian facility collapses, but they carry with them the knowledge that will change everything. MUTO Prime isn't just hunting Godzilla - she's preparing to use him as her next breeding ground, just as she did with Dagon sixty years ago.

# Chapter 6: The French Gambit

**Location: Nuclear Power Plant, Flamanville, France** **Time: 10 days after Guam incident**

The attack on the French nuclear facility represents MUTO Prime's final preparation phase. She emerges from the English Channel like a living nightmare, her massive form dwarfing the coastal power plant as she begins her systematic feeding.

But this isn't random destruction - it's **enhancement**. MUTO Prime absorbs the reactor's energy not just as sustenance, but as ammunition for the coming confrontation. Her bioluminescent patterns grow brighter, her electromagnetic field becomes more focused, and most terrifying of all, her parasitic ovipositors begin to glow with absorbed nuclear energy.

# The French Finale - Brutality in Broad Daylight

The final confrontation at the French nuclear facility is a masterpiece of natural savagery. Both creatures have learned from their previous encounters, and now they fight with the calculated viciousness of apex predators who know their opponent's weaknesses.

MUTO Prime opens with a seismic assault, her massive legs slamming into the earth with rhythmic precision. Each impact creates localized earthquakes that crack the ground beneath Godzilla's feet. She's not just attacking - she's reshaping the battlefield to her advantage.

Godzilla responds with the patience of a Komodo dragon who has cornered wounded prey. He doesn't charge into her trap. Instead, he circles, his massive head swaying hypnotically as he tracks her movements. His tongue flicks out, tasting the electromagnetic distortions in the air.

When he strikes, it's with surgical precision. His jaws clamp down on one of her four arms with crushing force. The sound is indescribable - chitin cracking under pressure, alien blood spurting in radioactive geysers. But more than the physical damage, he injects something far worse.

**Radioactive venom.**

The mutated Komodo dragon's bite carries concentrated atomic poison, designed to break down cellular structure at the molecular level. MUTO Prime's scream of pain echoes across the French coastline as the venom begins its work, causing her bioluminescent patterns to flicker and dim.

But the Jinshin-Mushi isn't finished. With three remaining arms, she executes a devastating counterattack. Her claws rake across Godzilla's face, one talon finding his left eye. The organ ruptures in a spray of vitreous fluid mixed with radioactive blood.

Half-blinded, Godzilla's grip loosens just enough for MUTO Prime to tear free - leaving her severed arm in his jaws. She staggers backward, hemolymph pumping from the wound as the venom spreads through her system.

**Now comes the true horror - both creatures fighting while slowly dying.**

Godzilla's atomic breath has evolved since their last encounter. The blue plasma now carries viral loads of radiation poisoning, turning every blast into a biological weapon. When the energy strikes MUTO Prime's carapace, it doesn't just burn - it **infects**.

Her armor begins to bubble and slough off like molten wax. Underneath, her flesh shows signs of rapid cellular breakdown. But she's still the Earthquake Beetle, and she has one final gambit.

MUTO Prime drives her three remaining claws deep into the earth, tapping directly into a geological fault line. The resulting earthquake is magnitude 8.0 - enough to level the entire coastline. But she's not trying to kill Godzilla with seismic activity.

She's **preparing him for implantation.**

As Godzilla struggles to maintain his footing on the fractured ground, MUTO Prime makes her desperate final play. Her ovipositor extends to its full horrifying length - a segmented nightmare designed to penetrate even titan-thick hide.

But Godzilla's Komodo dragon instincts save him. Instead of trying to dodge, he **lunges forward**, meeting her attack head-on. His massive jaws close around her extended ovipositor with bone-crushing force.

The organ ruptures like a burst balloon, spraying parasitic fluid across the devastated landscape. MUTO Prime's death scream is a sound that will haunt the nightmares of every survivor - part insect chittering, part dying whale, part tearing metal.

**Godzilla doesn't stop there.**

True to his reptilian nature, he begins the methodical process of consumption. Starting with the head, he cracks through MUTO Prime's carapace like a man eating crab legs. Her bioluminescent organs are extracted and devoured with surgical precision, their radioactive energy absorbed into his own system.

The feeding takes hours. By the time Godzilla slips back beneath the waves, all that remains of the mighty Jinshin-Mushi is an empty shell - a monument to the victory of natural evolution over parasitic domination.

# The Revelation

As the two titans face each other across the French coastline, Emma makes the final connection. MUTO Prime isn't just farming titans - she's **evolving** them. Each generation of parasitized hosts becomes stronger, more intelligent, more capable of surviving in a world transformed by radiation.

Godzilla represents the culmination of her breeding program - a titan with the perfect combination of power, adaptability, and genetic stability to serve as the ultimate host for her offspring.

""She's been planning this for sixty years,"" Emma realizes. ""Everything - Dagon's parasitization, the 2014 MUTO attacks, even Godzilla's awakening - it's all been orchestrated to bring us to this moment.""

# The Setup for the Final Battle

As MUTO Prime completes her feeding and turns her attention to Godzilla, bioluminescent patterns pulse across her carapace in complex sequences. She's no longer just hunting - she's **communicating** her intent to claim him as her next host.

The stage is set for the ultimate confrontation: Godzilla, the last free member of his species, against MUTO Prime, the ancient parasite who killed his companion Dagon and now seeks to use him for her next generation of offspring.

Emma watches from her monitoring station as two titans prepare for war, her hands shaking as she calibrates the frequency disruptor that might give Godzilla an advantage. Every part of her screams that she should let MUTO Prime kill the monster that murdered her son. But her scientific mind knows the truth - if MUTO Prime succeeds, Andrew's death will be just the first of billions.

""I'm not saving you,"" she whispers to Godzilla's image on the screen, thinking of Andrew's bright smile, his drawings of dinosaurs, his excitement about visiting daddy in San Francisco. ""I'm stopping her. There's a difference.""

But even as she prepares to potentially help the creature she hates most in the world, Emma knows that part of her will always hope that both monsters destroy each other. That would be justice. That would be peace.

That would be what Andrew deserved.

The battle for Earth's future is about to begin.

# Epilogue: The Calm Before the Storm

As emergency broadcasts warn populations across Europe to evacuate coastal areas, Emma Russell makes a final, desperate decision. MUTO Prime's electromagnetic capabilities make conventional weapons useless, but there might be another way.

In her research, she's identified frequencies that seem to disrupt titan neural patterns - the foundation of what will eventually become the ORCA device. If she can broadcast these frequencies at sufficient power, she might be able to level the playing field.

But using such a device carries risks. Disrupting titan communication could have consequences that extend far beyond the immediate battle. Other titans around the world might respond unpredictably to the electromagnetic interference.

As Godzilla prepares to face his greatest challenge, Emma prepares to make a choice that will echo through every subsequent kaiju crisis. The age of titan warfare is about to reach its crescendo, and humanity's role in that conflict is about to be defined forever.

  Last night’s dream had been different. More vivid than normal. Even now, as I sat on the picnic table bench on campus, I couldn’t stop seeing my father’s eyes. My dreams had always been constant and the emotions I awoke with varied from anger, to sobbing, to complete fear. Waking up peaceful was a rarity for me. It was only recently that I could actually recall my dreams hours later. Before, they’d disappear as soon as I woke up. Now, they haunt me.  
  
  My hands still ached from clutching the pillow to my chest as I tossed and turned throughout the night. I didn’t have to close my eyes to see the scene replay for the hundredth time today. There I was, standing in my living room, nine years old again, wondering which of my father’s personalities would take the five steps from his study and turn the corner to stand before me. As soon as I saw his wide eyes, his twisted scowl, and his tense, rigid posture, I knew this night wouldn’t end with bedtime stories. So few nights actually did.  
  
  I wanted to back away but had learned it only made things worse when I showed my fear. I had to keep myself from searching the room for Rynna. I knew my nanny was gone. It was just me and my father, and he knew. He always knew when I had lost control, as I had just minutes before. Before I could react, he hoisted me off the ground, his palms cupping under my arms. He held me at eye level, his frantic stare making it hard for me to keep eye contact. I was afraid of my father in these moments; in the times where he didn’t feel at all like himself and I was nothing but a failure to him. For a split second, I thought I saw his eyes soften and an apology flit across his features, then all I saw was the flash of orange in his eyes before he dropped me to the ground and ran out the back door.  
  
  That was the part that made no sense. My father’s power source was green. One of the many colors associated with Witch power. Orange was the power of Hunters — of killers — and I’d seen my father release his power enough times to know that he was no Hunter. I was in mid-thought, wondering why my dreams never made any sense, when Bethany plopped down beside me with a, “Hiya!”  
  
  Her peppy, southern drawl interrupted my latest round of introspection and I was thankful for it. Bethany was one of those people you couldn’t resist talking to. Nice in the most sincere way, even though no one could imagine where all that positivity came from. In her short sundress covered in multi-colored bird silhouettes and her cardigan that she somehow managed to make look fresh and trendy, I wasn’t sure how I managed to win the lottery of college roommates. My messy top-knot, ripped Capri, and basic tee weren’t winning any fashion awards today, but she probably slept last night. I didn’t.  
  
  “Hey B. What’s up?” I asked as I popped my ear buds out of my ears. I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was dragging me out tonight. Some guy, somewhere, was having a party that we, “Just had to go to!” College was supposed to be a non-stop party, but I didn’t drink for fear of losing control, so I generally ended up being the DD. My father had managed to make the words “lose control” into the most terrible, gut-wrenching eleven letters the alphabet could string together, and, so far, I hadn’t dared stepping out of line. Even though he was hundreds of miles away, some things just stuck.  
  
  “Soooooo,” she started off slowly, her accent making it sound more country song and less you’re going to hate this. “There’s a party outside of town. A bunch of guys have a beach house they rented and it’s invite only,” she said. Her face was flushing, she was talking fast, and I knew what was coming next. “And… Micah’s going to be there!” She almost squealed as she smacked her palms together and looked at me with ecstatic, begging eyes.  
  
  Bethany has had a thing for Micah Clair since classes started. I keep telling her that I don’t think he’s the best news. I get the weirdest vibe every time he’s around, but I’ve continued to listen to her go on and on about his European accent and male model looks.  
  
  I was done for. Somehow, some way, this southern belle had become my first real friend and I couldn’t bring myself to say no even though it was the last place I wanted to be.  
  
  I guess this means I’m going to a party.  
  
  Great.  
  
     
  
     
  
  The music was shaking the walls. The green, yellow, and pink neon lights that probably once graced the walls of a bar somewhere in Brighton looked like they were going to come crashing down at any minute. Maroon 5 was going on about having moves like Jagger as people who might have been able to dance hours ago were now just falling all over each other.  
  
  Bethany grabbed my hand, dragging me through the crowd. Her head whipped back and forth, surveying the scene. The moment she spotted Micah, she stopped and I almost tripped over her. All of a sudden she turned and shoved me in the opposite direction, away from him.  
  
  “Does my hair look okay? Are you sure these shoes go with this dress? Is my eyeliner smudged?” She was smoothing her skirt and fluffing her hair, talking rapid fire.  
  
  With her olive skin and bright blond hair, Bethany looked like she had grown up on the California beaches. She adored dresses, her hair was always flat-ironed to perfection, and you wouldn’t catch her outside of our apartment without makeup. She firmly believed girls had no business going without eyeliner and mascara, at the very least. Though, oddly enough, she was anything but a girly-girl. She grew up on a farm raising chickens, riding horses, and doing whatever else it is people do in the middle of nowhere Mississippi. I knew she could get dirty, she just wasn’t really interested.  
  
  “Seriously, B, you’re fine. You look amazing,” I reassured her.  
  
  I glanced over her shoulder to see Micah looking our way. He stood in the corner of the room with a few other guys. I couldn’t help but acknowledge he was attractive, even if he wasn’t my type. His hair was a sandy blond and he wore it longer than most guys would dare. He had it tied at the back of his neck with some kind of leather strap. His polo and dark wash jeans seemed out of place with his Viking looks — shockingly blue eyes and long hair — but you couldn’t deny it was working.  
  
  Micah continued looking her up and down appreciatively, not realizing she was bordering a panic attack in his name.  
  
  “Besides,” I reassured her, “he obviously likes you from the back. Just get over there.” I turned her around with the intention of giving her a small shove but Micah was already parting the crowds coming our way. His eyes were locked on Bethany’s, a slow smile appearing as he got closer. I took this as my opportunity to get away and pushed my way through the throngs of people still bumping and grinding. Right before I stepped through the patio door, I turned back one last time to make sure Bethany was still comfortable. She had her back to me, so I couldn’t get a good look at her face. Instead, I found myself locking eyes with Micah. An internal warning bell went off and I recoiled, quickly turning away from them. I’d learned long ago that my instincts knew far more than my brain. I just wish I could pinpoint what it was about that guy that was setting me off.  
  
  As soon as I stepped out on the giant deck, the sea air hit my face. It tangled in my hair, whipping it around my shoulders as if playing hide and seek in the dark strands. I exhaled, not realizing I had been holding my breath.  
  
  I stood there a moment, just listening to the waves beat against the sand as the tide came in. The full moon came out from behind the clouds, brightening my path and leading me to the stairs that would take me down to the beach. I didn’t hesitate. Almost leaping to the bottom, I kicked my gladiator sandals off as soon as I hit the sand and ran toward the water. Just as the tide touched my toes, the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  
  
  Someone was there.  
  
  Instantly, a jolt of power raced through my veins. I tried frantically to calm it back down, to maintain control. But, against all effort, I’m sure my eyes went from their normal hazel to bright violet, as they always do when my power takes over. I stood there, staring out at the sea, trying to decide how to react. I couldn’t draw attention to myself, but I could protect myself if I had to — I had learned that much. I felt my power buil  
d; like small pinpricks of electricity racing through my veins, filling my blood inch by inch. I forced myself to soften my stiff posture, but kept my right hand open and out in front of me in case I needed to use it.  
  
  Since moving to Brighton, I’d been working to actually use my magic, but it still felt like a second person trapped inside me that I couldn’t force into compliance. Sometimes it worked with me, sometimes not. We’ve been fighting this battle for as long as I can remember and in times like these, when I didn’t know what I was dealing with, I trusted it more than myself. I stood there, my body still as my power rippled beneath the surface and cautiously probed around me, just waiting to be unleashed.  
  
  I slowly started to turn around when he said, “Oh, so you’re hiding from them too, huh?”  
  
  His voice was smooth and almost melodic, with just a little fire behind it. I somehow knew he was smirking even though I couldn’t see him. The moonlight hadn’t breached the shadow from the deck where I could see his outline sitting on a picnic table. He was sitting on the top with his feet on the bench and elbows on his knees. I heard the old, weather-beaten table creak and groan as he set his feet on the ground. A shiver ran through me; he looked dangerous.  
  
  “Do I know you?” Something told me I’d seen him before. The fear that had ignited my magic instantly turned to curiosity, the danger melting to intrigue. I could actually see the thready, purple wisps spreading out, poking around, trying to get a read on him. It’s a good thing humans don’t actually see our power unless we let them. Abruptly, I turned back toward the ocean, kicking myself as I mentally drew it back in.  
  
  What am I doing?! I don’t even KNOW this guy. What if he’s…?  
  
  “You don’t have anything to worry about,” he interrupted, as if reading my thoughts. I could hear his voice coming closer, a little tentative, feeling me out.  
  
  I’m sure he thinks I’m nutcakes. Well done, Amelia. You are here to blend in, not prompt people to think you’re a freak a month into the semester.  
  
  I sighed, took a breath, and turned to face him, not realizing how close to me he now was. The full moon cast light and shadow across his body as he stood just feet from me, silent, sizing me up as I did the same to him. I drew in a quick breath as all my thoughts came together in just two words. He’s gorgeous.  
  
  I couldn’t stop my eyes from roaming. There was something tortured about him, I could feel it as easily as I felt my own curiosity building. He stood just a few feet from me, clearly trying not to be intimidating. But, between the hints of a tattoo peeking out from under his black T-shirt and the leather cuffs on his wrists, there was an intensity he couldn’t hide. He had big eyes with long lashes a girl would kill for. As my gaze followed the strong, angular features of his face, I realized he had a dimple, just on the one side that must only come out when that corner of his mouth lifted into the smirk I had heard in his voice earlier. The one he was wearing now as he watched me watching him. For some reason, that dimple changed everything; transformed him in my mind to just being a boy on a beach.  
  
  “Hello?” I watched his lips move, turning into a full-fledged laugh as he waved his hand in front of my face, bringing me back to the present.  
  
  Oh, crap. And just like that, I reverted to the outcast kid that knew she didn’t belong.  
  
  “Um. Hi. So, yeah, do I know you? I don’t think I know you. I mean, I’ve only lived here a few months and classes just started. B — I mean Bethany Jackson — dragged me to this thing. She really just wants to see Micah and I couldn’t deal with all the people and the dancing and the booze and…” I was floundering, looking in every direction but at him. I was doing the motor-mouth thing I do when I don’t know what else to do. I hate meeting new people, especially people that feel way too familiar to be strangers.  
  
  “So, I’m just gonna go. Um…have a nice night,” I stuttered as I tried to move around him. Mentally, I couldn’t figure out why he was even still standing there after all of my rambling. Then, he grabbed my arm. Not hard, but enough to stop my sloshing through the rising surf. Just the contact of his fingers flared my power in a way I’d never experienced. It was like Pop Rocks under my skin, fizzing and bursting in small explosions beneath his fingertips. I quickly balled my hand into a fist and willed the rising power down. I could already feel the pressure and my energy level intensifying. I had to get control. I had to get out of here.  
  
  “Wait. Just, wait.” His voice was quiet and I could feel his curiosity. His emotions were so clear to me. I stopped and met his eyes. It was dark and I still couldn’t tell what color they were. For some reason, I was dying to know.  
  
  “I’ve seen you before. You’re Amelia, right?” He looked me straight in the eyes, still holding onto my arm, making it hard to think.  
  
  I nodded, “Yeah.” Brilliant response, Ame. Just brilliant.  
  
  “We have a couple classes together, but you always sit in the back and never say anything.”  
  
  My eyes squeezed shut. I was ashamed of my inability to make new friends and blend in. My deep-seated need to stay under the radar. This is fabulous. I went to move away from him again as he stuttered, “Oh. That was dumb. I’m sorry. Anyway, I’m Aidan. Aidan Montgomery.”  
  
  That’s when he finally let go of my arm, only to trail his fingers down my forearm and grasp my hand in his, leaving pinpricks of heat everywhere he touched as he attempted to shake my hand. He gave me his first full-on smile and the corners of his eyes crinkled. I saw the adorable gap between his teeth, and ran.  
  
  I had to restrain the energy pumping through me, keeping myself at normal speed as I scooped up my sandals and bounded up the stairs. I pushed back through the crowd, shoving and elbowing the drunken partiers out of my way as I went out the front door and to my car. I would text Bethany to let her know I was leaving and could come back for her later. I sincerely doubted she’d even notice my absence since I saw her laughing with Micah as I ran through the house. I jumped in to the old Buick, locked the doors, and finally exhaled. I could still feel the exact indents his fingertips had made on my arm, the electricity still bubbling and some part of me already missing him.  
  
  Holy crap. Who was that guy?  
Chapter 2  
  
  I was lying in bed the next morning, my arm thrown across my eyes, my hair tangled and spread across the pillow. I probably shouldn’t call it a bed. Really, it was a twin mattress thrown in the corner of my room, but it was there and I was trying to convince myself I could still sleep. Last night’s dream hovered on the edges of my mind, but I was used to being able to block out the hazy ones. Hazy nights were the best nights because it meant I actually slept. This morning’s problem was that every time I closed my eyes all I could see was him. Aidan.  
  
  I had a hundred questions I wanted to ask him but had no idea why. More than anything, I wanted to know how he was the first boy I’d ever met to make me feel like this; like I’d been lit on fire from the inside out. Even though I’ve never had a real boyfriend, I have had crushes before, but no one had ever stopped me in my tracks like he did. My curiosity about him almost outweighed how hot he was. Almost.  
  
  Finally, I gave up, forcing myself out of the bed and into the bathroom. The hot water would soothe out the tension and the coffee pot in the kitchen would do the rest. Of course, as I padded into the kitchen after my shower, Bethany was already holding my mug out toward me as she stood at the counter stirring her own. She was an early riser and already cheery at this ungodly hour, even though she’d been out late last night and had been dropped off by none other than Micah himself. I had heard their futile attempts at whispering as I stared at the ceiling hoping for sleep.  
  
  “Ame, you know I was right, right? That party was exactly what we needed. Girl, you’ve got to get out more. Meet a guy like Micah!” She bumped me with her hip and tried to hide her Cheshire smile behind her coffee mug.  
  
  I harrumphed a little and rolled my eyes.  
  
  “Oh, no you don’t, honey. You aren’t raining on my parade today. I’m riding high and I have his number to prove it!” Bethany sauntered into the living room like she was walking a pageant floor. She had a box full of trophies claiming her title of Miss Sweet Pea, Miss Rankin County, and a host of other things, so she strutted like a superstar. As she settled into the couch, I was met with a perfectly-sculpted arched eyebrow and the question I dreaded most. “So, where exactly did you run off to last night? Did you meet a guy? You’re holding out on me, aren’t you?”  
  
  I hated how excited she looked at the prospect and how well she could already read me. But, for whatever reason, I just couldn’t tell her about Aidan. I didn’t know exactly what to say; how to describe the oddest encounter I’d ever had with a guy. How to explain that someone who initially seemed so dangerous didn’t feel that way at all. I just knew I would sound like an idiot.  
  
  “You know me. I wandered around for a while, got bored, walked the beach, and then headed home. I wasn’t actually feeling the greatest and I didn’t want to bust up your moment with Micah.” I hated lying. I hated how necessary lying was.  
  
  “Really? Another migraine? Well, that sucks. Next time I won’t bail on you. Pinky swear. We’ll make the rounds together and see if we can find you a matching cutie so we can do doubles!” Bethany dropped back into the couch with a wide grin.  
  
  I could only shake my head and laugh as I headed back to my room, leaving her to reminisce about last night. Curled into my beloved chocolate brown papasan chair, I tried to relax as my fingers slipped and slid across the satin edges of the blanket that hung over the side. Even after months spent with Bethany and realizing that she was the first real friend I’ve ever had, my first true best friend on top of that, I was afraid of her judgment. There was so much I wanted to share with her, but it just wasn’t possible.  
  
  Early on, I had tried to explain some of my background and why I am the way that I am, but it wasn’t like I could explain my powers and where I really came from. I told her about my mom and tried to explain to her that my relationship with my father was rocky at best, and basically non-existent at worst. That my only real friend growing up was my nanny Rynna, who had been my mom’s best friend.  
  
  It wasn’t always this way. At least, that’s what my brother, Cole, would tell me before he left me to handle my Dad and his paranoia on my own when I was ten. There was apparently a time when my family was whole and my dad wasn’t crazy, but that was before my mom died, which also happened to be the day I was born.  
  
     
  
     
  
  Moving to Brighton had never felt like a choice to me. It was where Cole finally settled after traveling the US for years. When he left, we had made a promise to be together again, and I had clung to that promise every day. It was what kept me going. Cole had opened a MMA gym a few years ago and, between the college kids and the locals, it was doing really well. He also had an amazing apartment and said he would help me out with anything the scholarships wouldn't cover. So, when I turned eighteen the summer after I graduated high school, I told my father I was leaving.  
  
  “What do you mean you’re going to live with your brother? Just out there, for the whole world to see you? Haven’t you listened to me at all?” my father said, his arms an animated swirl around him, gestures punctuating every question.  
  
  We were sitting at the kitchen table in a rare moment where my father had left his study and seemed lucid, and I couldn’t stop fidgeting with my coffee cup as I tried to hold his gaze and be the adult I thought I already was. It would have helped if the questions he asked were rational, or if his too-long dark hair wasn’t sticking up in every direction. If the glasses he shouldn’t need weren’t smudged and his eyes weren’t wide and looking a little too wild. I knew this look and where our conversation was headed before I even answered, but I also knew it was time. I had played my part. I made sure he ate, I got good enough grades to get scholarships, and more than anything, suffered through his endless rants about how it didn’t matter what he’d said eighteen years ago, I wasn’t going to marry the prince and “they could never have me”.  
  
  I tried to speak softly, but firmly. It was as if I were the one talking to their child, instead of the other way around. “Dad, I did listen to you. I’ve heard everything you’ve said. But, I have to do this. No matter what happens, I know that I have this time — just three years — to myself. The queen has kept the prince as far from me as you’ve kept me from him. You won’t even tell me his name. I can’t keep watching the years waste away, Dad. I’ve got to have some of my own life before this betrothal goes into full effect. And, I’m going to be near Cole, I’ll still have family close.”  
  
  I winced as he slammed his palm on the wooden tabletop. “Don’t you talk to me about him! You know that I regret that moment. If I could take it all back, I would. You shouldn’t do this, Amelia.”  
  
  I sighed and tried to put my hand over his, cursing myself for bringing up Cole and aggravating the situation further.  
  
  “I know, Dad. It’s just…well, I’m not asking. I’m telling you that I’m doing this.” I tried to hold his confused stare but couldn’t. “I just want you to know that I won’t be alone, Dad. I’ll be okay. I’ll make friends — human friends. It will be everything you ever wanted for me.”  
  
  “No, Amelia,” he said, sounding defeated. “This is nothing that I wanted for you. I wanted to go away from here. I wanted to take you far, far away, but I…I just…couldn’t.” I watched his pupils dilate and the flash of green that meant he was losing control again.  
  
  “They are watching, Amelia. They are always watching. They can’t believe it; they can’t believe you have what they want,” he said.  
  
  He was looking around the room as if Queen Julia’s Hunters were right there, listening behind the pantry door. I couldn’t take it when he got like this. “They’ll leave you alone, you know that, right? You just have to try a little harder to convince them. You have to stay in control, Amelia.”  
  
  I had grown to hate the word “control” more than anything in the world. I was a constant failure at it, and that one word was the source of almost every argument my father and I had ever had. Taking a deep breath, I tried to placate him, to stop his hands from shaking as his emotions s  
welled and the pressure in the room grew. It was a struggle to maintain my own power as it fed off of his, my emotions rising in reaction to the despair I heard in my father’s voice. I had long-accepted his eccentricities but it wasn’t often that his anger gave way to fear, as it was doing now. It’s okay, Dad. I’m going to be okay. I’ll do everything you taught me. I won’t use my power. I’ll stay under the radar. I’m going to be fine, Dad, do you believe me?” His fingers tightened on mine as he nodded a little too frantically. Standing, he yanked me in for a rare hug. “Just watch for them, Amelia. They are everywhere. Watch for them and stay in control.”  
  
  The weight of my lies were a stone on my chest as I tried to relish our short embrace, nodding into his shoulder at the appropriate times. I was going to Brighton to experience a normal life — that part was true — but I was also going to try to figure out exactly who I was. I never believed I could get out of the betrothal, but at least I could go in prepared — something my father refused to do for me. There had to be someone out there that could explain what being an Elder meant and how to control the power that was growing faster than I knew how to handle.  
  
     
  
     
  
  I moved through the morning in a bit of a haze. I went to class and took my notes, but never really contributed. With everything my father had ingrained into me, I still didn’t like to draw attention to myself even though my almost-black hair, hazel eyes, and slim figure would always make me more noticeable. Realizing that I would likely run into Aidan today, I had put in a little more effort than my normal thrown together outfit. It shouldn’t matter — he shouldn’t matter — but I was still a girl and he was still gorgeous. I don’t know how I’d never really noticed him before, but a lot of our classes were seminars with tons of people in them and I never made efforts to seek out new friends.  
  
  Before I stepped a foot in the door of Composition, I knew Aidan was there. From outside the room, I could feel my internal reaction. It was as if we were back on that beach and the pads of his fingers were burning their marks into my skin. It was uncomfortable and exhilarating, my body reacting to just the nearness of him. As I walked into the room trying to reconcile myself with the heat in my veins, there he was, the guy setting the fire, sitting right there in my normal back row seat.  
  
  I stood awkwardly for a minute staring at the back of his head, not sure what to do. He was fully immersed in conversation with a guy one seat over, fist-bumping and laughing over some story being told. I caught just the slightest stiffening of his back as I moved through the doorway. He knew I was there too, but didn’t even acknowledge me as I walked past him and sat a few rows up and to the left. My annoyed stare could have bored holes in the back of his head as I walked past, even though I realized that he very well could have chosen my seat without realizing it. It was ridiculous that I was so irritated, and just the fact that he could get me worked up was making it worse. I couldn’t stand how much I wanted to know more about him.  
  
  I got myself settled, already hating my middle seat but pulling out my notebook and our poetry assignment for today’s class anyway. As I was leaning up from my backpack on the floor, I stole a glance in Aidan’s direction through the hair that had fallen in my face, only to find myself locking eyes with him. He was staring right at me — his chin in his hand and a slow smile creeping across his face, not even remotely trying to be subtle. I couldn’t move. As if in slow motion, I saw his right eyebrow raise and humor shine through his eyes. It was no coincidence that he had taken my seat today. He was issuing a direct challenge and I was having a hard time backing down. I narrowed my eyes as if to ask him what he wanted, and he did the damnedest thing — he winked at me.  
  
  That tiny motion brought me back to myself. I whipped back around and started straightening my papers, fidgeting in my seat. I heard a low chuckle from behind me and just knew it was him. It reverberated through me and sent a burst of heat to my cheeks. Apparently, the good-guy act from last night was just that. This guy was a player. Great. Just what I need.  
  
  The classroom door slammed and we all turned in surprise to find a man standing just inside the room. He looked uncomfortable in his wool cardigan, dress slacks, and Buddy Holly glasses. I couldn’t tell if he was going for Mr. Rogers or a failed attempt at hipster, but thankfully he broke the silence as he surveyed the class. “Ms. Brown is ill, so today’s class is canceled.” I was disturbed by how his eyes seemed to linger on me, but he finally turned on his heel and left.  
  
  I quickly gathered my things and bolted out the door. The hallway was empty since the other classes were already in session, making it a quick jaunt out into the commons and toward my car. I was just cutting across the last patch of grass when I heard footsteps clearly running to catch up.  
  
  “What’s your hurry, doll? We never got to finish our conversation last night.” Aidan fell in step with me, the dry grass crunching under his flip-flops. With all of the contempt that I could muster, I glanced his way only to find him giving me a cocky half-smile. I stopped short, finally noticing the eyes I found so intriguing last night were actually gray. It was like staring into smoke and I was caught off guard by the flecks of bright blue scattered throughout his iris.  
  
  “W-we weren’t having a conversation last night,” I stuttered. “You surprised me, and then I realized I had somewhere to be.” I tried my best to sound distant, pulling my posture up to at least pretend I could look down at him as if he didn’t have me by at least a few inches. I finished with, “I’ve got no real interest in knowing you. I’ve seen your type.” I don’t know why I said that. It sounded weak and silly and I didn’t even mean it, but Aidan was just unnerving.  
  
  That eyebrow rose again but he didn’t comment on my ridiculous statement. “You had somewhere to be? At midnight on a Thursday? In the middle of a party you were clearly trying to escape?” I could feel him holding in his laughter. Damn it, this guy irritated me.  
  
  “Yes,” I snapped. “And, what I do or don’t do is absolutely none of your business.” With that, I hit the key-less entry, tossed my backpack and purse in my car, and climbed in. I gave a fake wave, complete with a roll of my eyes, and backed out of the spot. In my rear view mirror, Aidan stood in the grass looking confused and mildly amused with his hands in his shorts pockets and head cocked to one side. I had to force myself to pull my eyes away and put the car into drive, but that didn’t stop me from glancing up a few more times as I pulled away.

We’re visiting for the second time—our first trip was in May 2024, when we stayed in Ginza and Shibuya, so we’d like to try a different part of the city this time. We’re planning a 7-day stay in mid-January and are leaning toward Akasaka, since it seems the most convenient of the three, but we haven’t settled on a hotel, apartment, or Airbnb yet (Mimaru is one option).

Right now, our top choices are Oakwood Apartments Azabu and Section L West Shimbashi. I’ve heard Shimbashi can be a bit quieter, which is fine, but given it’ll be winter, we’re considering which area would be the better fit. We like being able to step out for coffee or a quick bite, have a few drinks at a nearby bar, and on some days just stay in the neighborhood to eat or relax. Most days, we’ll likely be out exploring all day. Will either area feel too quiet late at night—for example, will places be closed when we get back?

We’re open to other suggestions and have been scouring maps and booking sites. Ideally, we’d like a washer/dryer in-unit or in the building. We’ve also looked at Airbnbs, but a place with a lobby could be more convenient, like holding luggage before our late flight out. Bonus points if the lobby has coffee or light snacks for those cold days when we don’t feel like going out, but minor preference, so not a dealbreaker.",1,1754885135.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best carbon filter water systems employ various advanced technologies to ensure optimal filtration and water quality.HereS a closer look at some of the key features to consider when making your selection.

**Activated Carbon Filtration**

Activated carbon is the heart of most carbon filter water systems. This type of carbon has been treated to create a highly porous structure, which dramatically increases it's surface area. This enhanced surface area allows the carbon to effectively adsorb a wide range of contaminants, including chlorine, sediment, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and pesticides. The effectiveness of the activated carbon depends on the source material (e.g., coconut shell, coal, wood) and the activation process.

**multi-Stage Filtration Systems**

Many advanced carbon filter water systems utilize a multi-stage filtration process to provide comprehensive water purification. These systems typically include a sediment filter to remove larger particles,a pre-carbon filter to remove chlorine and odors,and a post-carbon filter for final polishing.Some systems also incorporate additional filtration stages such as reverse osmosis or UV sterilization for enhanced contaminant removal. The number and type of filtration stages directly impact the overall effectiveness and lifespan of the filter.

**Filter Lifespan and Replacement**

The lifespan of a carbon filter depends on the water quality and the amount of water used. Most manufacturers provide estimates for filter lifespan, usually measured in gallons or months. Regular filter replacement is crucial to maintain optimal water quality. Systems with longer filter lifespans can reduce maintenance frequency and overall cost of ownership. Look for systems with clear filter replacement indicators or automatic reminders to ensure timely replacement.

**Flow Rate and Water Pressure**

The flow rate of a carbon filter water system refers to the amount of filtered water it can produce per minute. A higher flow rate is desirable for households or businesses with high water consumption. Water pressure is also an important consideration, as some systems may require a certain level of water pressure to function properly.Check the specifications of the system to ensure it meets your water pressure and flow rate requirements.

**Certifications and Standards**

Look for carbon filter water systems that are certified by reputable organizations such as NSF International or the Water Quality Association (WQA). These certifications indicate that the system has been independently tested and meets stringent performance standards for contaminant removal and safety. Compliance with these standards provides assurance of the product's quality and effectiveness.

Key features of the best carbon filter water systems include:

*   High-quality activated carbon filtration.
*   Multi-stage filtration systems for comprehensive purification.
*   Long-lasting filters with convenient replacement indicators.
*   Optimal flow rate and water pressure for various needs.
*   Certifications and standards for quality assurance.

## Core Benefits

Carbon filter water systems offer numerous benefits compared to tap water or bottled water. From improved taste and health to environmental sustainability, here are some key advantages.**Improved Taste and Odor**

Carbon filters excel at removing chlorine and other chemicals that can impart unpleasant tastes and odors to tap water. This results in water that is significantly more refreshing and enjoyable to drink. Food and beverages prepared with filtered water will also taste better, enhancing your overall dining experience.

**Enhanced health and Safety**

Carbon filters can remove a wide range of contaminants that may be present in tap water, including lead, pesticides, herbicides, and industrial chemicals. By removing these harmful substances, carbon filter water systems contribute to improved health and safety. This is especially important for individuals with compromised immune systems or those concerned about the potential health effects of water contaminants.

**Convenience and Cost Savings**

Compared to bottled water, carbon filter water systems offer significant convenience and cost savings. With a carbon filter system, you have access to clean, filtered water on demand, eliminating the need to purchase and store bottled water.Over time, the cost of a carbon filter system is far less than the ongoing expense of buying bottled water.

**Environmental Sustainability**

Bottled water consumption contributes to plastic waste and environmental pollution. By using a carbon filter water system, you can reduce your reliance on bottled water and minimize your environmental footprint. Carbon filters themselves are typically made from environmentally kind materials, and many systems offer recyclable filter cartridges.

**Protection of Appliances**

Filtered water can definitely help protect your appliances from scale buildup and corrosion. Minerals and sediments in tap water can damage water heaters, coffee makers, and other appliances over time. by removing these impurities, carbon filter water systems extend the lifespan of your appliances and reduce the need for costly repairs.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about carbon filter water systems.

**How frequently enough do I need to replace the carbon filter?**
the filter replacement frequency depends on the system and water usage. most filters last between 6 and 12 months, but it's crucial to follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Some systems have indicators to alert you when it's time to replace the filter.

**can a carbon filter remove all contaminants from water?**
Carbon filters are effective at removing many common contaminants, such as chlorine, sediment, VOCs, and some heavy metals. Though, thay may not remove all contaminants, such as fluoride or certain bacteria. For extremely contaminated water, consider a system with additional filtration stages, like reverse osmosis or UV sterilization.

**Are carbon filter water systems easy to install?**
Installation difficulty varies depending on the system type. Faucet filters are generally the easiest to install, requiring minimal tools. Under-sink and whole-house systems may require more technical knowledge or professional installation. Most systems come with detailed instructions.

**Can I use a carbon filter with well water?**
Yes, carbon filters can be used with well water, but it's essential to pre-treat the water if it contains high levels of sediment, iron, or bacteria. A sediment filter before the carbon filter can help prolong its lifespan. It's also recommended to test your well water regularly to identify any specific contaminants that need to be addressed.

Directed by photographer Nick Brandt, the music video for Stranger in Moscow was filmed in Los Angeles and follows six different people who are all dealing with some form of isolation, loneliness and depression. The song was written by Michael while in Moscow, Russia for the Dangerous World Tour during a time when he was feeling extremely alone and isolated from the rest of the world due to his immense fame and the media scandal that erupted during 1993. 

The video is very simple compared to Michael’s others and relies on viewers being moved by the emotions and expressions of the people in the video rather than any choreography or over the top visuals. Special effects were used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.

The video has 89 million views on YouTube.

Harlow's POV

Today was my 16 birthday yay lucky me. It's been just over 6 years since my family sent me off to live with my aunt. All I wanted for my birthday was a tattoo and I had begged my aunt for months to sign the paper for my birthday so I could legally get the tattoo. She had finally agreed and I had made the appointment for today my birthday. My friends Callum and Toby were coming with me and then we would be meeting up with Jezz short for Jezabell and Zara later on.

As I head downstairs my Aunty Anita was at the table with the traditional maccas (McDonalds) breakfast (don't judge we do this for special occasions). I smiled, it's not that I don't like my aunt, we just are on our own paths. She never wanted kids and I was only suppose to be here for a few weeks yet here we are 6 years later and nothing has changed. ""Your dad and brothers sent you some gifts. They are in the box there"" Anita said. I scoffed, yeh they can shove there gifts up there arses. I want nothing from them at all.

""You can have them or send them back, I don't want there"" I replied. Aunty Anita just nodded, she was use to it by now. I stopped accepting anything from them 4 years ago. ""I'll send them back tomorrow, I have already paid for your tattoo and here my dear is the form filled out giving you permission"" Anita said before handing me the forms. ""I have already gone to the shop and handed them in, they are expecting you at midday. Will you be home tonight or are you staying out with your friends?"" Aunty Anita asked. This woman knew me to well. ""I'm staying out with my mates"" I replied. She just nodded before saying ""Harl's don't drink to much please"" and with that Aunty Anita took off heading to work.

It was 11am and Toby who was 17 would be picking me up soon to drive me to get my tattoo. I had designed it myself, it was a present to myself and to symbol that I was moving forward and going to free myself from the Walker family would abandoned me when I was 10. When I was younger I would cry myself to sleep wondering why my father had never come back for me. As I grew up I realised he had picked his wife over me. My mother was a nasty jealous bimbo. From the minute I was born she made it clear she never wanted me and tormented me when no one was around. My brothers would try to run interference when they were around and that kept her away from me when they were home but there were times when it was her and I home and I would cop it. As I got older things got worse as my brothers had there own lives and my father was working long hours. I would be locked out of the house when I got home from school, she would lock me in the basement, she would destroy my room and clothes and would just tear me down with her words. She got physical too which is when my father decided to send me away instead of her.



Once inside the tattoo shop I headed over to the chick at the counter and told her who I was, she instructed me to take a seat and that my artist would be out soon. The walls were covered in different stencils of tattoos and there were photo books on the coffee table which had custom designs in them, I was currently flicking through. ""Harlow"" someone called out, I looked up and there was a guy standing near the counter so I got up and walked over to the counter.

""Hey I'm Brett, I'll be doing your tattoo today. Your aunt dropped all the paperwork yesterday.”

30 minutes later and I was done. Brett cleaned me up and told me to go look in the mirror at the finished product before he would wrap it up. I got up and headed to the mirror forgetting the towel. ""I love it. Thanks so much Brett"" I stated before we heard ""you got a rack Harl's"" bloody Callum yelled before we heard a smack which I'm assuming was Toby hitting him. I walked back over to the seat so Brett could wrap up the tattoo and tell me how to keep it clean and care for it.

More people were entering the shop now but I was still listening to Brett telling me that I could take the cover off later today but not to go swimming and to use the cream which he gave me to keep it clean. ""Harl's flash us again or let's get going"" Callum called out. ""Cal, Brett is just wrapping it up and we can go"" I called back. ""What?"" someone else said.

I looked up and saw two people I never wanted to see again in my life, Jett and Jax.



Jett's POV

Today was Harlow's birthday and we were in the same town as her to check on one of our new shops which we opened here a few weeks back. First we dropped a package off to our Aunts place for Harlow from all of us. Inside were her presents and an invite to have dinner with Jax and I. We missed our sister a lot but we just never really found the time to bring her back home. Well we did but she never responded to any of us after the first two years and we didn't want to push it thinking that within time she would come back but that never happened.

After dad sent Harlow to live with Aunt Anita he thought he could get rid of our so called mother quickly but he couldn't. She wouldn't go away and caused a lot with the club and other clubs in the area. It took three years to sort the stuff out and my mother overdosing before it was safe to bring our sister home. We sent plenty of texts, letters and parcels as well as trying to call her but none were answered by our sister.

Dad spoke to Anita about it but she just said she doesn't want to come back. We were upset about it but what could we do? Not like we could force her to return, I just hoped she would see us today because I missed my sister. I regret not seeing her grow up and being there for her. I was 18 when she was sent away. Dad missed her the most and even invited her home for school holidays but we had radio silence from both Anita and Harlow.

Jax and I immersed ourselves in our work and own multiple tattoo shops across Australia and we are still growing. We are 24 now and hope by thirty we can expand into other countries. We started by taking over the club shop and it got bigger from there. Dad helped us grow and by the time we were 20 we had 4 shops opened with 20 artists employed by us. The old shop still did all the work for the club with Jax and I doing the club tats ourselves. Hendrix didn't trust anyone else with the club mark so it fell to us. We also are the only ones who get to tattoo our brothers with the family oath. Each one of us boys has the same oath tattooed on us and each one has a tattoo for Harlow even Leo has a tattoo for Harlow. He got it done when he was 17 he never wanted the family oath.

As we head inside our new shop we hear some kid screaming ""Harl's flash us again or let's get going"" I look at the kid then to where I see a young chick sitting in the chair. ""Cal, Brett is just wrapping it up and we can go"" she calls back ""Oh"" I heard Jax say before the girl looks towards us. I take a sharp intake of breath, that’s my sister, that’s Harlow and she is getting a tattoo wrapped up. Brett is talking to her about tattoo care and all I can think is my baby sister is here with us in our shop. I should of been tattooing her not Brett. As she is leaving she thanks Brett and said she would be back again for more and tries to leave.

I grabbed her arm as she tries to walk away while Jax is yelling at Brett for tattooing a 16 year old. I am looking at my baby sister and she is grown. She is drop dead gorgeous but I am bias. I will beat any guy that comes near her, she is still my baby sister after all. She isn't a kid anymore thats for sure and I can't help but feel sad I missed out on her growing up.

Brett and Jax are still talking about the fact he tattooed Harlow. Jax turns to look at Harlow before she speaks ""sorry who are you both?"", I drop her arm, how can she not remember us? She spent the first 10 years of her life with us. Me and the rest of her brothers raised her because of our incompetent mother.

""What? You don't remember us? Come on Harlow"" I say to her. I'm worried, maybe she had an accident or something and she doesn't know who we are. ""You know each other?"" Brett asks and Jax and I spin round to answer him. As we go to answer we hear the door close and spin around to see Harlow legging it. ""Oh"" I say before taking off after her. I chase after her screaming her name ""Harlow, wait please"" but she doesn't stop and jumps onto a car before it takes off. ""Oh"" I scream out as Jax snaps a photo of the car.

""I'm calling Leo and getting him to check the plates on the car"" Jax says. ""I'll call Dad and Hendrix"" I reply before pulling my phone out and dialing Hendrix. He answers on the first ring ""Jett, this better be important, kinda busy here"" breaths out. ""Harlow"" is all I say before I hear him move ""what about Harlow? Is she ok? Did you see her? Is she coming home"" he says quickly ""baby come back and finish off"" I hear some chick say. Oh I interrupted his root, he is going to be in a bad mood for a bit. ""Don't call me baby, get your and get out Danny"" I hear Hendrix say ""it's Haley you prick"" I hear the chick say before a slam of the door.

I clear my throat so my brother knows I'm still on the phone. ""Right Jett, Harlow is there something wrong?"" Hendrix asked. ""Well I think you might want to get dad and anyone else who is around to hear this. Jax is on the phone to Leo so leave him he is running plates for us"" I replied. ""I'll call you in 5"" Hendrix said before hanging up. Jax and I head back to the shop to wait for Hendrix to call. We also need to talk to Brett about what he tattooed on our baby sister.

Once we got back to the shop Brett was sitting at the counter drawing ""Brett what did you tattoo on Harlow?"" I asked him. ""The word free and a butterfly. How do you know Harlow?"" Brett asks. ""Why is that your concern?"" Jax asked. Brett is young 19 but he is a good artist. His dad runs this place for us. ""She is cute"" Brett replies and goes to say more ""she is our sister"" I cut him off and he gulps.



I'm pissed. Where is my sister? It's 7pm and she hasn't been home. I see a car pull into the driveway and watch as my aunt gets out of her car. Both Jax and I are out of the car quick smart walking towards my Aunt. We are both fuming. We reach the door just as my Aunt is about to close the door. ""Aunt Anita, we need to talk"" Jax says. ""You better come in then and don't take that tone with me"" Aunt Anita replies.

We all head into the kitchen and I see the box of gifts sitting on the table. ""You didn't give her the stuff we brought over?"" I ask my aunt. ""I did. She told me to send it back just like every other year. I'll take it to the attic with all the other stuff later. What do you both want?"" Aunt Anita asks. ""What do you mean she wanted to send it back?"" Jax asks. Aunt Anita sighs loudly. ""Ok I'm guessing it's about time you hear this. Take a seat boys"" Aunt Anita said.

Aunt Anita grabbed a drink out of the fridge offering us both one but we declined. We need clear heads to find our sister after we speak to our Aunt. ""Right well I'll just come right out and say it. For the first two years Harlow cried herself to sleep every night begging to be sent back home. She was a mess and missed you all. She struggled a lot, I was hardly around either, I have my work and I never wanted children. Don't get me wrong I love you all but I never wanted to be a mother. After those two years something changed. Harlow changed, she no longer cried herself to sleep every day. She started to rebel a lot. She smashed her phone that your father sent and refused to take anymore calls. All the letters that were sent were torn up without her reading them. Then she started telling me to send the stuff back to you because she wanted nothing to do with any of you. I spoke with your father and he just said she was going through normal teenage stuff so I didn't push. As it went on it got worse so everything you sent I would put in the attic. When your father called asking me to send Harlow home she point blank refused saying she no longer had a family. She threatened to leave if I forced her to go back so I told your father she wanted to stay for a little longer. He kept ringing and inviting her back so eventually I just stopped answering his calls because I couldn't keep making excuses. Harlow is doing fine here, she doesn't get into trouble with the law and her grades at school are fine. We both do our own thing and she is settled"" Aunt Anita said.

""You mean that she has no idea we have been contacting her all this time?"" I ask. Aunt Anita just nods her head. Our sister thinks we abandoned her because she won't even open anything we have been sending her in years. She doesn't even have the same number anymore but we text her all the time and have done for years. Our father still pays the bills and upgrades her phone every year.

""Where is her phone?"" I ask my aunt. ""She has her phone. The phone your father brought is in the attic with the rest of the stuff, her SIM card is in the other room"" Aunt Anita says. ""Where is she now?"" Jax asks. ""With her friends"" Aunt Anita replies sipping her drink. ""When will she be home?"" I ask. ""She probably won't be tonight"" Aunt Anita replies.

I take out my phone and call dad. ""Dad we have a problem"" I say as soon as he answers. ""What's going on? Have you found Harlow yet?"" He replies. ""Dad you better sit down"" I start. ""Listen here Jett just tell me what is going on"" he yells. I can hear he is at the club and when he yells it goes quiet. I relay to my father everything that Aunt Anita said letting him know that for the last 4 years Harlow had no idea we had been communicating with her and had refused to read any letters and the stuff we sent her was all in the attic cause she didn't want it.

""I'm on my way"" my father replies before hanging up the phone. ""He is on his way. We better find Harlow quick smart"" I tell Jax. We go to leave before Aunt Anita calls out ""find Toby and you find Harlow, those two have been joined at the hip since she got here. He lives just down the road"", with that we head out to find our baby sister.

Harlow's POV

It's getting late and Callum's mum will be home at about 10 when she finishes work. We have been drinking most of the night. Toby had taken the dressing off my tattoo and helped put some of the cream on. Zara and Jezz asked if it hurt but it honestly didn't and I'm so happy I did it. I love my tattoo. I just wish I never ran into my brothers but that's a problem for another day. They won't kill my birthday buzz.

Haha oops, I think I might of drank to much. ""Harl's we have to walk to my place, ain't no way I can drive now"" Toby calls out. I just nod my head. We have done this before and it doesn't bother me. ""One more drink though?"" I ask Toby who shakes his head no. ""One for the road though"" I smile at him and attempt puppy eyes on him. I'm way to drunk for trying that so I just laugh and Toby soon joins in. Jezz and Zara took off earlier cause there parents wanted them home before 9pm.

I said my goodbyes to Callum who was a lot more sober than me and cleaning the bottles up before his mum got home. Toby and I headed out me holding a bottle of drink for the walk to Toby's place. ""I love you Tobs"" I say to him. ""I love you too Harl's more than you know"" he replies.

We continue to walk and were a few houses away from Toby's place. I knew I had to skull my drink so I stopped pulling Toby back. ""Got to finish my drink Tobs"" I said before going to skull my drink. I look at Toby who is looking at something like he saw a ghost. I couldn't help my drunk arse and start laughing at him ""Tobs what's got your knickers in a twist?"" I laugh out ""oh twisted knickers"" I say quiet loudly while still laughing at myself. ""Come on Tobs that was funny"" I say hitting him in the arm. I just shrug when he doesn't respond and again go to skull my drink before someone grabs it from me ""hey that's mine, give it back"" I yell without looking who took my drink. I even stomped my foot on the ground. I wanted that drink and took it fair and square before I turn to see who took my drink.

I turn around and see Hendrix. Oh, I turn back around and face Toby. ""Tobs how much did I drink? I think I had a little bit much tonight cause I'm seeing things. How much did I drink?"" I say to Toby rather loudly. Just then more people who look like my brothers come towards me. ""Tobs did I take anything? I think I need to lay down before I pass out"" I say. ""Harl's you aren't seeing things. I think we are in deep"" Toby replies quietly. ""Run"" I scream before trying to leg it out of there.



Hendrix POV

Dad came storming into my office at the club fuming. I don't know what his problem was but I knew even though I was the president he wasn't to be messed with when he was like this. ""Get your brothers here now"" he said. I just nodded and text Kody, Cameron and Leo to get there arses to my office urgently. Within 10 minutes they were here. In those 10 minutes dad didn't really speak he paced and said ""Oh"" a lot. Something bad must of happened. I haven't seen my father like this in years. The last time he was like this was when he sent Harlow away.

As my brothers walked in they looked at dad and then me but I just shrugged my shoulders. They each took a seat and we waited for dad to speak. ""Your sister, she doesn't know anything. For the last four years she hadn't accepted any communication with us. She refused everything we sent to her. She doesn't have her phone. She wants nothing to do with us"" he ranted. ""What do you mean?"" I asked my father. He went on to explain everything that Jett had told him about what Anita had said and the fact she took off and had a tattoo.

""Oh"" I said before getting up and throwing the first thing I picked up which happened to be a glass across the room. ""We should of gone and got her"" I screamed out. ""Where is she now?"" Kody asked. ""No one knows"" Dad replied. ""I'm leaving now to go find her and bring her home"" he continued. ""I'm coming with you"" I said. ""We are coming with you"" Kody said. Dad just nodded his head.

As soon as we got into town we met up with Jett and Jax to get an idea of where our sister was. They said they were watching Stephen Bell's place apparently our sister was friends with his son. It was close to 10pm so we were going to wait as Anita had said Harlow wouldn't be home tonight. ""What's the plan if she doesn't turn up?"" Leo asked. ""We will find her"" I replied to him. We split up in three cars, dad took of towards Anita's house to wait there with Leo, while Jax and Jett stayed right outside the Bell's place. Kody, Cameron and I also were close to the Bell's house.

Just after 10.30pm we see two figures stumbling down the street. I could see one was a guy who had his arm around a young girl. I picked up the phone and called my father ""she is here"" is all I said before hanging up. There my sister was stumbling down the street with some guy laughing and carrying a drink in her hands. She grabs the guy and pulls him back talking about her drink. She bursts out laughing when she sees the guy she is with staring at Jett and Jax who had gotten out of the car and was heading towards them. I get out of the car as well just as my father and brother pull up. I walk up behind Harlow who smells like she has been drinking a ton of spirits and grab the drink out of her hand. She whines about it before stomping her foot just like she use to when she was little and didn't get her own way.

She turns around and I look at my sister who is clearly wasted before she turns back round to her friend saying ""Tobs how much did I drink? I think I had a little bit much tonight cause I'm seeing things. How much did I drink?"" The guy she is with doesn't say anything. The rest of our brothers come towards us watching Harlow and the guy she is with. ""Tobs did I take anything? I think I need to lay down before I pass out"" she says. The guy she is with is looking around seeing us all before he says something I don't quiet hear. Next minute Harlow screams ""run"" before they both try to take off. ""Grab them"" Jett calls out.

Dad moved quickly grabbing hold of Harlow while Kody grabs the dude she is with. Harlow is thrashing around in dads arms while the guy is calling out to her making sure she is ok. ""Toby, let him go arseholes he doesn't have anything to do with this. Let me go, let me go"" Harlow screams out. ""Harl's, Harl's are you ok? Let her go"" the guy I know is Toby screams.

""Toby I think I need to ....."" Harlow starts to say before she begins to vomit. ""Oh"" dad says grabbing her hair and pulling it back so Harlow can spew. ""Harl's, I told you to eat something"" Toby says trying to get away from Kody. ""How much has she had to drink?"" Kody asks. ""What's it to you?"" Toby replied. I'll give it to the kid, he has balls that's for sure. ""It's our business when it involves our sister"" Kody replies. ""A sister you dumped 6 years ago"" Toby replies.

""Shut up kid you have no idea what your on about"" Cameron replies. "" I don't. I have been with her every day for the last 6 years. Where you came from and let us go back to mine so she can sleep it off. She wants nothing to do with you"" Toby spits. ""Take the kid home and get in the car. Harlow will be staying with us tonight"" Dad said. Jett and Jax walked Toby to his door before they headed to there car. I headed over to dads car jumping in the drivers seat. ""Cameron take my car and meet us at the hotel"" I called out the window. Dad got in the back holding Harlow who has passed out once she finished vomiting.

Once we get to the hotel dad carriers Harlow into the room and takes off her shirt, shoes and jeans. She is covered in vomit. I grab one of my shirts and hand it to dad who slips it over her head. He lays her on the bed and busses her forehead before going into the bathroom, I'm assuming to have a shower. I look at my little sister. God she has grown up and Jett and Jax were right, she is gorgeous and I know I will have to beat boys away from her when we take her home. I wanted to beat that Toby kid who had his arm around her tonight. I sigh and take a seat on the couch in the room, one of us will have to stay with Harlow tonight in case she vomits in her sleep. It's going to be a long night.

I knocked because I needed to get ready for bed, I had headphones on, and was so sleepy I didn’t realize that she had a FaceTime call to a 47(m) year old that she’d been talking to, facing out towards me in my bra, about to use the restroom. I asked her if she couldn’t do that again. She then pressed the issue and I angrily explained that I was not in a good mood, and I didn’t wanna get into while she’s still on the phone. If my friend was getting n@ked in front of the man I’m talking to I’d warn her. In which she then stormed off. The next morning while cooking breakfast, I try to mention last night to clear the air. She says I have no reason to be upset, and that she was hurt by my tone. We then got into a heated argument about it and I’ll I’m looking for is an apology. We have one bathroom and it’s insane for her to think that a FaceTime call pointed at me during my nighttime routine without my consent was okay. I told her she needed to just apologize and she got angrier and just started complaining about everything under the sun. We both storm off on not great terms. 
That night she leaves for a date, I decided to start decorating and crafting these 2 lamps that she’d brought into the house 2 years ago, they sat in the common area and she allowed me to paint them twice to my hearts content. While on the date, she viewed my story where I posted about having fun decorating the lamps. I go to bed, she and I never coming to an agreement about the bathroom debacle.
The next day is where it gets serious. 
I’m in my room avoiding conflict, and I started to hear her banging things around. 
She’s putting furniture I gave her in the hallway. Then I look at the coffee table where the lamps are, and she’d taken them.
A screaming match erupted when confronted about why she felt the need to steal my craft id been so innocently working on.
She said they’ve never belonged to me and she was taking them back? I thought this was an extremely petty act, considering she never spoke about lamps and she’d let me paint them twice before. My blood boiled and eventually I said she was to give me back everything she’d ever borrowed, this screaming and conflict arises to the point where she asked me to hit her, and takes off her glasses. We’re both yelling but she’s the self proclaimed “fighter”  and I asked her to go away before this escalates and finally- I start shoving everything off the kitchen counter, resulting in glass cups and items of both of ours breaking. Not my finest moment. I was yelling so bad and basically had just trashed that room, and she calls the cops. They asked us to go elsewhere for the night to cool off. 
She says she’s filing a restraining order against me and is not going back to our apartment. I feel horribly guilty for losing my temper. AMITA?

1mn31fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colognes/comments/1mn31fz/very_sensitive_nose_a_lot_of_fragrances_smell_the/,"Very sensitive nose & a lot of fragrances smell the same to me, any advice?","Hey everyone,

Hopefully, this is the right place to ask. I recently went to Macy’s as a beginner to colognes/fragrances and went through their fragrance selection. They had most of the JPG line, some Valentino, Montblanc, etc.

I only found a few that I even *tolerated*:

* **Liked:** JPG *Le Beau* (not *Le Beau Le Parfum*), *Stronger With You Intensely (bit strong)*, Valentino *Uomo Born In Roma Intense (also strong)*
* **Disliked:** Most of the Azzaro *The Most Wanted* line, almost all smelled like a mix of a pine forest and a dentist’s office. Weirdly The Most Wanted Azzaro, which I expected to love based on the scent profile on fragrantica, I didn't like at all (I tend to love sweeter smells so I thought I'd like the toffee). 

Main issues:

* **Too woody/pine-heavy** scents turn me off quickly.
* Some fragrances are so strong they immediately give me a headache (this is my biggest concern for daily wear).

For reference, I do have one I really like: **Nikos Sculpture** light, citrusy, clean. I’d love to find something similar for daily/gym wear, *and* a separate “night out” scent with more depth.

I’m also really into **vanilla, coffee, peach**, and soft citrus notes, but I’ve noticed a lot of fragrances list vanilla and I can *barely* smell it. Longevity matters — I didn’t buy JPG *Le Beau* because on my skin it faded fast, while Valentino lasted 8+ hours even through a shower.

**Practical questions:**

1. Any **specific fragrance recommendations** I should look at that fit my profile?
2. Any you’d recommend I **actively avoid** given my dislike for woody/pine-heavy or headache-inducing scents?
3. Is it true that **longevity is tied to oil concentration** (EDT vs EDP), and does that *also* mean higher intensity? In other words, can something last long without being overpowering?
4. For vanilla-forward scents, are there any **men’s or unisex fragrances** where the vanilla actually stays noticeable the whole wear?
5. Are there good **layering combos** for boosting sweetness (vanilla/coffee/peach) without turning a scent too heavy?",1,1754884763.0,Colognes,0,0.67,False

Recently, I’ve been having a really hard time with doing anything, because I can’t do it in the best way, or can’t guarantee that it will bring me the maximum amount of joy. I don’t want to start certain projects at work, bc if I don’t have all the info or tools it wont come out as good. I struggle to figure out which coffee shop to do personal work at, and can’t figure out what I want to do (play a game, read, work on the book I’m writing?). 

If I don’t have my AirPods with me, everything’s a wash and I shouldn’t even try. I’ll start a work out program and skip a day, so I might as well throw it out the window. It almost feels debilitating. Most days, I have to call my husband into the room, tell him how I’m feeling, and ask him what to do. And when he gives me a suggestion, most of the time I get frustrated bc that’s not the perfect solution (but there is no perfect solution?)

I saw someone on tik tok refer to a similar feeling as “optimization OCD”. I don’t know anyone with OCD, but do these behaviors seem similar? I plan to bring this up to my new therapist in my next session.",1,1754884728.0,OCD,0,1.0,False
1mn30ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mn30ql/can_i_still_make_it_into_my_industry/,Can I still make it into my industry?,"So I graduated a year ago and have been working at a law firm for a couple of months now. I have a degree, but my GPA is not the best for law school, and I would say it's pretty average. I'm not like a paralegal or a legal assistant at my law firm, but I'm starting to realize I want to become a lawyer. My job at the law firm primarily involves administrative/receptionist tasks. Although I do realize I want to be a lawyer, the law firm I work at specializes in lemon law, which I'm not so interested in. My supervisor is chill, and I could chat about anything with him. The coworkers are all nice or mostly keep to themselves, so I don't have any stress about that. However, I want to explore other laws since the lemon law is not something I'm interested in.

I want to get into immigration law or bankruptcy law. I genuinely want to get into this law more since it's been something that I have been looking into more in my free time. I used to be part of this club during my undergraduate that allowed me to connect with a big alumni network. I never really connected with them during college because a lot was happening, and I was still on the fence about law school because I was not sure about getting into it. (The club was an organizing/political club.) It has been a bit hard to find a job at these law firms since they are asking for a year in immigration or bankruptcy law, when I only have experience in lemon law.

My question is whether I should still do coffee chats with these alumni now. I found them on LinkedIn and found that they are in the type of law I'm interested in. Do you think they would still be down to connect with someone like me who is out of college now? Would I eventually get a job offer after applying for these specific types of law firms? I'm interested in working at this law firm. I'm just now interested in lemon law because cars are not my thing.

# 1. Leaderboards Aren’t Universal

It’s not a single leaderboard for everyone. It looks like there are multiple boards, possibly unique to each player.

Even if you’re in 1st most of the time, watch the last minutes - rankings can suddenly jump (as [u/anxietiess](https://www.reddit.com/user/anxietiess/) noted, it can increase by 5 crowns every 10 minutes, almost as if the game is adjusting where it thinks you should be).

* This happened to me before: I was in 1st until 30 minutes before the event ended, then dropped to 2nd.
* This time, however, it didn’t happen, probably because I was much further ahead... I stopped at **rock 35** with **16.8a crowns**, compared to last time when I stopped at **rock 31** with **13.5a crowns**.

# 2. Strategies & Purchases

I bought a few deals this time because I wanted to figure out the most efficient paid strategy. I’ll post those numbers separately.

If you want to help with data collection:

* **Screenshot the deals** in the next events and comment here so I can gather more info for a future guide.

# 3. Improve Satisfaction Card Strategy

If you want to try not spending any money, focus on optimizing your upgrades, timing your actions strategically, and making the most of free boosters and ad bonuses to maximize your progress.

* Save gems and open **premium packages** as soon as **Improve Satisfaction** is available.
* Don’t wait until other facilities unlock, or your chances of getting the card will drop.
* Improve Satisfaction multiplies **all facility gold bolts**.

\- Big thanks to [u/Stormandreas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Stormandreas/) for this tip.

# 4. Pay-to-Win Factor

**This event felt heavily pay-to-win**. I have the No Ads Package + VIP, which give huge bonuses and a big advantage over fully free-to-play players. I also bought a few deals that helped me upgrade some facilities and my Improve Satisfaction Card to level 8.

# 5. Card Multipliers & Upgrade Costs

Each card level is about **5x the multiplier of the previous**:

|Card Level|Multiplier|Cards Needed to Upgrade|
|:-|:-|:-|
||||
|1|x5|—|
|2|x25|2 cards|
|3|x125|4 cards|
|4|x625|10 cards|
|5|x3.13a|20 cards|
|6|x15.6a|50 cards|
|7|x78.1a|100 cards|
|8|x390a|200 cards|

# 6. Gold Bolt Output Varies by Facility

Even with the **same multiplier**, different facilities give very different amounts of gold bolts. For example, at the end of my run:

* **Sapphire Polisher** – Level 7 (x78.1a) → **6.10d gold bolts**
* **Ruby Polisher** – Level 7 (x78.1a) → **610c gold bolts**

**Tip:** Always check a facility’s base bolt production before buying deals.

# 7. My Tips for Winning

* **Prioritize Ad Booster Effects** – Ignore most other upgrades. Maximize gold bolt output.
* **Save for the Crusher Attack** – Don’t waste on Fuel Efficiency. It gets harder to earn bolts as you progress (I broke rock 34 and stopped at rock 35).
* **Use Boosters Wisely** – Focus them on gold bolts and money. If you’re far enough along, invest more in **Gold Bolt Profit** over staff speed or cash profit.
* **Choose Good Deals** –  If you’re set on getting the gold drill and don’t mind spending a bit, skip the coffee shop and grab a good deal at least once... it’s sadly the easiest way.

If you can imagine yourself in this scene, exchanging warm smiles and getting lost in that moment, then perhaps you desire the same kind of spark and connection that I’m looking for.

I’m a shy, romantic, creative, intelligent, loyal, honest, playful, non-religious, ISTJ “old-fashioned gentleman” seeking real love with a young, sweet, affectionate, “girlie” woman who’s wanting a magical attachment with her partner - a unique guy searching for a rare girl.

I live alone in a nice house in a quiet rural area away from severe weather events, and enjoy movies & TV shows (sci-fi, action/adventure, superhero, fantasy, comedy, romance, thriller, and much more), gaming (boardgames, card games, chess, video games - PS3 LEGO, XBOX Halo, Wii, etc), crafting & DIY (including 3D printing), cosplay, nature walks, live shows, shopping, Corvette cruises with the top off, and candlelit dinners prepared by me for you… or by us together with flirty mischief, kisses, and soft jazz music. 🥰

My music tastes are varied, but favorites are Depeche Mode, The Cure, The Smiths, Enya, KISS (with makeup), INXS, Mannheim Steamroller, and composers like John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, and James Barry. (Fun Fact: Country and rap are to music what pineapple is to pizza… 🤮)

My clothing style is as diverse as my music interests and has been described as “eclectic” - sometimes studded faux leather, sometimes Asian-inspired silks, other times just casual t-shirt & shorts in summer or cozy sweats (at home only) in winter. My passions include sci-fi (especially classic Star Trek, and it’s okay if you’ve never watched it - you can discover it together with me), Asian style (decor, fashion, geography, etc), model kits (I've got hundreds of unbuilt treasures in waiting), and a pescatarian/vegetarian/vegan cruelty-free lifestyle. I've also got all the materials and toys for sewing homemade authentic TOS, TWOK, and TNG Starfleet uniforms (for **both** of us)… one of many fun activities we’ll do together, so buckle up and hang on! 😁

I’m seeking a born-female feminine lady who prefers wearing dresses & skirts, has long-ish hair length (up top only 😉), petite slim figure, naturally pretty without much makeup, and smells nice (because as a deep Scorpio I’m quite sensitive to scents). Regarding astrology, I’m supposedly most compatible with Pisces, Cancer, Capricorn, Taurus, or Virgo, and she should be honest, faithful, caring, and frequently “in the mood”… like a kid chasing the neighborhood ice cream truck.

If you love hand-holding, hugs and cuddles, stealing kisses in public, artistic hobbies, snuggling on a couch binge-watching movies & TV shows, gaming, and occasional weekend getaways… and you’re seeking a committed, long-term permanent relationship based on mutual attraction, shared interests, and genuine respect for each other… we could be a cute couple. I’m not interested in being a “daddy” - I want to be your equal companion, and I’ll be more sincere than Jean-Luc Picard quoting Shakespeare to Lwaxana Troi!

My dealbreakers? Must be at least 18 yrs old, no smoking (includes vaping), no drinking (includes wine), no coffee, no tattoos at all, no piercings (except maybe earlobes), no kids (including grown), no pets, and no circus clowns. (Is there anyone still standing? 😂)

If you’ve made it this far, open a hailing frequency to me for discussing the terms of our surrender to each other. 🖖

For context:
🔹Median USA home price (June 2025): ~$442,500 (NAR)
🔹30-year fixed mortgage rate: ~6.6% (Freddie Mac)
🔹U.S. median household income (2023): ~$74,580 (U.S. Census Bureau)

If you run that through a mortgage calculator, the monthly principal + interest alone is around $2,800 with 10% down — before property taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA fees, etc. That’s already ~45% of a median household’s gross monthly income. And that’s assuming you even have ~$44k saved for the down payment in the first place.

I’d love to hear from couples in this age range:
🔺Are you actually buying right now? If so, what strategies helped you save enough for a down payment?
🔺Did you have help from family (gifts, inheritance, co-signing)?
🔺Are you relocating to lower-cost-of-living areas, or choosing longer commutes?
🔺How much of your monthly income are you comfortable putting toward housing?

I’m hoping this can be a practical discussion, not a “just stop buying coffee” thread. I know some of you have creative savings hacks or financing strategies.

Not sure about you but I’m finding working from home to be so isolating.  Despite back to back zoom calls, I’ve never felt so disconnected from other human beings. Wondering if this already exists… But does anyone want to start a coffee meetup for people working from home, just to have some regular real-life human interaction.  Maybe we could all block off an hour on a regular day and just get together and chat with a real person for a bit before plugging back in.

I guess this might not work… as who wants to meet up with potentially creepy strangers from Reddit.  But thought I’d put it out there.  

If it matters, I’m late 40s M, professional, divorced with two teens.  Not looking for romance (I get that there are better ways to do that online), just some friends to interact with between zoom calls and while my kids are occupied with school (or camp right now).

I woke up before my alarm. Not because I couldn’t sleep — I slept fine — but because my brain had already reminded me what day it was. Launch day.

I rolled over, rubbed my eyes, and checked the wall calendar. Big red circle around today’s date with one word in the middle: Go. If I were late, Halvorsen would make sure I regretted it. He hated anything that even hinted at “lack of discipline.”

I swung my legs out of bed and headed for the shower, letting the hot water wake me up. No breakfast. My stomach was already tied in knots, but not from fear — from adrenaline. Getting into the Orion IV was everything I’d trained for. Everything I wanted.

The air outside was sharp and cold. A line of low clouds hung over the horizon like they were watching me leave.

The transport took me straight to mission headquarters. I barely had time to drop my bag before an assistant told me Halvorsen wanted to see me alone. When he shut the door, I knew it wasn’t going to be a routine pep talk. His eyes were heavy, his voice low.

“Before you go,” he began, “there’s something you need to know. The ship you’re taking—Orion IV—it’s been up there before. Three times. And three people died. None of them made it back.”

I let out a short laugh. “You make it sound like a ghost story.”

“It’s not a joke, Shay. We couldn’t explain any of it. The data vanished. Communications dropped. And…” He hesitated. “…we found one suit torn apart.”

“And no one else is willing to step on that ship except me and Peter, right?”

He gave a slow nod.

“Then don’t worry. I’m coming back.” I walked out before he could try to change my mind.

Outside, the launch pad was alive with camera flashes and reporters shouting over one another.

“Three brave people risked their lives for this company,” one of them called out. “What makes you different, Shay? Why are you so confident you’ll return when they didn’t?”

I barely broke stride. “Maybe they just didn’t have the strength to survive. I do.”

Peter fell into step beside me, giving me a sideways look. “Confident much?”

“Better than walking in scared,” I said.

He snorted. “Yeah. Maybe that’s what gets you killed.”

DAY ONE

The launch morning smelled like machine oil and burnt coffee.
I could feel the vibration of the cargo loader through the soles of my boots before I even stepped onto the boarding ramp. Orion IV loomed in front of me — not some gleaming sci-fi cruiser, but a working ship. The hull plating was dull gray, pitted in places where micrometeorites had kissed it over the years. Faded stenciling marked the ship’s registry and hazard warnings. The forward observation dome caught the sun like a blind eye.

Peter was already at the base of the ramp, leaning against a supply crate, sipping from a dented steel thermos.
“Morning,” he said without looking up.
“Morning,” I replied, pulling my bag higher on my shoulder. “She’s bigger than I thought.”
Peter smirked. “She’s uglier than you thought too, admit it.”
I looked up at the Orion again, her heavy thruster housings jutting like shoulders. “Ugly’s fine. As long as she holds together.”
“She will. Mostly.”

Inside, the ship smelled different — cleaner, but in a way that told you the air was filtered, recycled. The lighting strips along the corridor hummed faintly. Everything had a layer of matte paint to cut glare, and the narrow passageways forced you to turn your shoulders to pass certain bulkheads.

Peter showed me to my cabin — a narrow compartment with a single bunk, a wall locker, and a small desk bolted to the wall. The mattress was wrapped in plastic.
“Welcome home,” he said.
“It’s… cozy.”
“That’s one word for it. Just don’t expect room service.”

We spent the morning running pre-flight checks. That meant walking through the engineering bay — a cramped jungle of pipes, heat exchangers, and access panels — and listening to Peter mutter to himself as he ticked items off the maintenance slate. The main reactor hummed deep in the belly of the ship, a constant low vibration that I felt through my hands when I touched the bulkhead.

By noon, the engines were warming. The ship shuddered as the docking clamps released. Through the observation dome, Earth slid slowly away, a blue-and-white marble wrapped in black.

Peter leaned beside me, his hands in his pockets. “Last chance to change your mind.”
“I’m fine.”
He studied me a moment longer than felt casual. “Alright then.”

Lunch was heat-pouched protein stew, eaten at the mess table in near silence except for the hiss of the CO₂ scrubbers. I caught myself glancing over my shoulder more than once, though I couldn’t have said why.

The voices started small that evening. Not whispers, exactly — more like faint bursts of static from a radio, but carrying the suggestion of syllables. I heard them while brushing my teeth in the tiny head compartment. I froze, foam in my mouth, listening.
Nothing.
Peter passed by in the corridor and glanced in. “Something wrong?”
I shook my head. “Thought I heard… Never mind.”

We turned in early. Lying in my bunk, I felt the ship’s vibration through the thin mattress, a steady heartbeat that filled the silence. Somewhere in that hum, faintly, something said my name.

DAY TWO

I woke to the dim blue glow of the cabin’s night-cycle lighting. For a moment, I wasn’t sure what had pulled me out of sleep — the ship’s hum was constant, but there was something else. A faint, high-pitched sound, like someone exhaling right against my ear. I sat up, listening hard. It stopped.

The morning routine was cramped and mechanical. The head compartment was barely wide enough to turn around in. The water from the tap was lukewarm, metallic-tasting. Breakfast was freeze-dried eggs, reconstituted in a cup with water from the galley dispenser, and two hard biscuits.

Peter was already on his second cup of coffee.
“You’re up early,” he said without looking at me.
“Couldn’t sleep.”
“That’s normal, first few nights. You’ll adjust to the ship’s rhythm.”

We ran diagnostics on the nav systems. The Orion’s bridge wasn’t like the ones in recruitment brochures — more like a cluttered workshop with display screens bolted at odd angles, their casings scratched and worn. The captain’s chair had a patch on the armrest where the vinyl had split, exposing yellow foam.

By midday, the hum of the engines had settled into a pattern I almost didn’t notice — until I caught myself tapping my fingers in time with it. Peter caught me doing it.
“Ship’s getting into your head already,” he said with a faint grin.
“I guess.”
He didn’t stop watching me until I turned away.

We ate lunch in the mess again. The food was fine, but it all had that faint aftertaste of the air’s dryness. I found myself drinking more water than usual. The condensation unit hummed softly in the corner, its drip-drip-drip almost like a clock.

That afternoon we did a maintenance walk-through. In the aft service corridor, the lighting flickered twice, just long enough for my eyes to adjust to the darkness and think I saw someone at the far end. I blinked, and it was just the sealed hatch to the cargo hold.

Back in my cabin, I sat at the desk and tried to read from my datapad. Every few minutes, I thought I heard something outside the door — a shuffle, or maybe fabric brushing metal. When I finally got up and checked, the corridor was empty.

That night, the voices came back, clearer than before. Not words I could make out, but a rhythm — something that felt like language, if I could just listen harder. I lay there, heart beating fast, until I heard Peter moving in the corridor. I opened my door.
“Peter,” I said softly.
He stopped. “You hear it too, don’t you?”
I didn’t answer.
He nodded once, then kept walking.

DAY THREE

The third morning, I woke before the ship’s internal chronometers signaled wake-cycle. The dim lights in the corridor were still on night mode, casting everything in shades of gray-blue.

In the galley, Peter was already there, spooning porridge from a steaming pouch into a bowl. He looked tired, his eyes shadowed.
“You’re up early again,” I said.
“Couldn’t sleep,” he replied flatly.

We spent the morning in the forward maintenance bay. The space smelled faintly of ozone from the electrical panels, and the walls sweated condensation in the corners. We checked the hull sensors — all clear — and recalibrated the thermal regulators.

By midday, I noticed something strange: the voices didn’t only come at night. While crouched under a panel in engineering, I heard them again, faint and rapid, just under the sound of the coolant pumps. Peter froze too, his wrench still in his hand.
“They don’t like it when we talk about them,” he whispered.
My skin prickled. “Who’s ‘they’?”
He just shook his head and went back to work.

Lunch was protein noodles with soy sauce from a little foil packet. I barely tasted it; the mess felt different, as though the air was thicker somehow. The hum of the ship sounded less steady — like there was something behind it, breathing with us.

That evening, Peter suggested a walk through the observation dome. From there, the stars were endless, a field of cold fire stretching in all directions. For a few minutes, the beauty of it drowned out everything else.
Then I saw something move — not outside, but in the reflection of the glass. A shadow that didn’t belong to either of us.

DAY FOUR

I woke from a dream I couldn’t remember, only the feeling — like someone had been leaning over my bunk, watching me sleep. My throat was dry, my lips stuck together. The air recyclers hummed like a slow breath above my head.

The corridor outside my cabin was unusually cold. My breath didn’t fog, but I felt the chill in my bones. I pulled on a thermal shirt before heading to the galley.

Peter was there, but he didn’t greet me. He was sitting hunched over a cup of coffee, both hands around it like it was the only warm thing left in the ship. His eyes followed me without moving his head.
“You ever think about what’s between here and there?” he asked suddenly.
“What do you mean?”
“Between Earth and wherever we’re going. All that black. All that silence. Maybe it’s not empty.”
I tried to laugh. “I think I preferred it when I thought it was empty.”
He didn’t smile.

We spent the morning checking the communications array. It sat in a cramped alcove near the dorsal ridge of the ship, surrounded by panels full of blinking indicator lights. The metal walls here seemed thinner — I could hear the distant whine of the ship’s hull adjusting to microtemperature changes. Sometimes, that whine blended with the voices.

At one point, while Peter was rerouting a signal, I thought I heard my name — Shay — stretched out and low. It came from the wall itself, as if someone’s mouth were pressed to the metal on the other side. I stepped back, heart pounding.
Peter noticed. “Don’t listen too hard,” he said quietly.

Lunch was rice and rehydrated vegetables. I ate quickly, my appetite smaller every day. Peter picked at his food, barely touching it. We were both drinking more water than before — the air was so dry now it made my skin itch.

That evening, we walked through the ship’s main corridor toward engineering. The walls felt narrower than before. Halfway down, the lights flickered, and in that split second of darkness, I saw shapes — tall, thin outlines — just far enough away that I couldn’t see their faces. When the light came back, the corridor was empty.
Peter kept walking like nothing had happened.

That night, I dreamed of the Orion’s corridors stretching far beyond their real dimensions, branching into paths I’d never seen before, all leading downward. I woke to find I was gripping my blanket so tightly my fingers hurt.

DAY FIVE

The first thing I noticed that morning was the smell — a faint, sweet rot that wasn’t there before. I followed it to the air vents in the corridor. When I leaned close, I could swear I heard the faint sound of someone breathing inside the ductwork.

Peter was in the mess, cutting open a pouch of oatmeal. He didn’t look up when I entered.
“You smell it too?” I asked.
“Yeah,” he said. “It’s not coming from the food.”
“Then where—”
“Don’t ask.”

We spent the morning in engineering, checking coolant flow rates. The reactor chamber was hotter than usual, the heat pressing against my skin even through the thick coveralls. The voices were louder here, as if the hum of the reactor carried them up from somewhere deep in the ship.

While I was logging the readings, Peter leaned close enough for me to feel his breath on my ear.
“They’re getting bolder,” he whispered. “Last night, one of them spoke clear as day.”
“What did it say?”
He straightened. “It asked me to open the airlock.”

Lunch was barely edible — some kind of protein loaf with a tangy sauce. I forced it down, feeling watched the whole time. The mess’s walls seemed to press closer, the lights harsher. I kept glancing at the doorway, expecting someone — or something — to walk in.

That afternoon, we passed the cargo hold. The hatch was sealed, but I heard movement inside — slow, deliberate footsteps, then silence. Peter didn’t stop walking.

That night, I heard the voices again, but now they were in my cabin, not the walls. They circled the bunk, whispering in a language I couldn’t understand, but their tone was clear: they were amused.

DAY SIX

I didn’t sleep.

At breakfast, Peter’s eyes were bloodshot, and he had a small cut along his cheekbone. When I asked, he said, “Ran into something in the corridor.”
“What kind of something?”
“Not sure it was there when I looked.”

The day’s task was hull inspection — a walk through the narrow outer maintenance passages, where the walls curved with the ship’s body and the sound of our boots echoed endlessly. The light here was dimmer, the air colder.

Halfway through, we came to an access point for an exterior viewport. The glass was frosted with micro-impacts, but through it I saw a shadow against the stars. Not a ship. Not debris. Something vaguely human-shaped, drifting alongside us, keeping pace.

I didn’t say anything. Neither did Peter.

Lunch was silent. The mess felt wrong, like someone had rearranged things while we were gone — the chairs just slightly off-angle, the table closer to the wall than before.

That evening, while walking to my cabin, I saw a figure ahead. It looked like Peter, but it turned the corner without acknowledging me. When I reached the corner, the corridor was empty. A moment later, the real Peter stepped out from engineering behind me.

That night, I locked my cabin door for the first time.

DAY SEVEN

The Orion IV’s artificial morning came and went without me noticing. I’d been awake for hours, listening. The voices weren’t in the walls anymore — they were inside the room, moving from one corner to another, their whispers rising and falling like the tide.

Peter met me in the mess. He didn’t look good. His hands shook when he poured coffee, and he’d stopped trying to hide it. His eyes kept darting to the ventilation grilles.
“They don’t like the lights,” he said. “I kept mine on all night.”
I didn’t tell him I’d done the same, or that it hadn’t helped.

We were supposed to check the starboard coolant manifold that day, but the ship had changed. The corridor leading there seemed longer, the curve more gradual. I swear I counted fifty-seven paces more than yesterday. The air was heavier too, like we were walking through a place that didn’t want us moving forward.

Halfway there, we passed a bulkhead hatch with a viewport. On the other side, the lights were out. Shapes moved in the darkness, tall and swaying, like reeds in deep water. Peter quickened his pace, and I followed without a word.

At lunch, neither of us touched the food. It wasn’t the smell — though that had worsened, a syrupy rot in every breath — it was the way the protein loaf seemed to pulse slightly, like it was breathing. I pushed my tray away. Peter had already done the same.

That night, the voices stopped whispering. They began humming. Low, deep, and so resonant I felt it in my teeth. I covered my ears, but it was inside my head now.

DAY EIGHT

I found Peter in engineering before the lights came on. He was standing at the reactor console, staring into the heat shimmer through the shielding glass.
“They want me to go outside,” he said, voice calm, almost casual. “They say they’ll show me what’s keeping pace with us.”
I told him not to listen. He smiled — not like he was happy, but like he knew something I didn’t.

The air felt damp that day. Condensation beaded on the corridor walls. My boots squeaked on the decking. Somewhere deep in the ship, something was dripping.

We checked environmental controls, but the humidity reading was normal. While I was logging the diagnostics, Peter leaned on the console, head tilted like he was listening to something far away.
“They know your name,” he said. “They say it differently, but it’s still you.”

Dinner was impossible. The food looked fine, smelled fine, but every bite was like chewing paper soaked in cold water. My stomach turned. Peter didn’t even try.

I went back to my cabin early. The humming came again, but this time it wasn’t from the voices — it came from the ship. Every panel, every bulkhead, every screw and seam vibrated with it. It didn’t stop until I fell into a dreamless sleep.

DAY NINE

I woke to knocking. Not on the door — from inside the wall behind my bunk. Slow, deliberate, and too heavy to be the sound of metal cooling.

Peter wasn’t in the mess. I found him in the corridor near the airlock. The inner hatch was sealed, but he was standing close enough that his breath fogged the glass.
“They’re waiting,” he said. His voice was raw, like he’d been shouting. “They’re so much closer now.”

I tried to pull him away, but he didn’t resist, just followed me back to engineering. We didn’t talk after that.

The ship was darker today, the lighting a fraction dimmer than normal. Or maybe my eyes were just struggling to adjust. In the observation bay, I saw them again — the shadow shapes outside, moving with us. There were more now. Many more.

That night, I locked my cabin, shoved my chair under the handle, and sat awake with the lights on. The voices were speaking again, not humming. And this time, I understood a few words.
We are here.
Let us in.

DAY TEN

I didn’t remember leaving my bunk, but I was in the corridor when the artificial morning came on. My head ached. My hands were stiff and cold.

Peter was gone. Not in his cabin. Not in engineering. Not anywhere the ship’s internal sensors could locate.

The airlock’s inner hatch was ajar. The panel beside it read MANUAL OVERRIDE ENGAGED. I stepped closer. The outer hatch was sealed, but frost had formed along the edges of the glass. I wiped it away with my sleeve.

Something was out there. Not floating now — pressed against the viewing pane. Its skin, if that’s what it was, was the same dull gray as the void behind it. The face was long, stretched, features too narrow to be human. Its mouth moved, and I heard Peter’s voice in my head.
It’s better here.

I staggered back, but the lights went out before I could run. Total darkness. And in that darkness, the sound of many hands — wet, cold hands — touching the walls all around me.

When the lights came back, the corridor was empty. The airlock yawned open before me, a dark mouth breathing cold into the corridor. My breath came in shallow bursts, each one smoking in the frigid air. The frost on the deck plates spread beneath my boots in branching veins, crackling faintly as it crept toward me.

The voices were louder now — no longer whispers, no longer words, just a thousand throats humming one endless, hollow note. It was in my chest, in my bones, vibrating the fillings in my teeth.

I tried to turn away, but my feet wouldn’t obey. My muscles strained, trembling under my own weight, but something unseen had hooked itself into me — not my skin, deeper — and was drawing me forward inch by inch.

The thing beyond the hatch pressed closer to the glass. Its eyes — black pools without light — widened in slow recognition. Its mouth opened wider than any mouth should, jaw unhinging until it was just a black tunnel leading into nothing.

Cold spilled over the threshold and wrapped itself around my ankles like water. My knees buckled. I reached for the bulkhead, fingers brushing the smooth metal, but it was slick with something that wasn’t condensation. My hand came away wet, and the smell hit me — salt, copper, rot.

From somewhere beyond the void, Peter’s voice cut through the hum. Not from the thing outside, not from the walls — but right behind me.
Shay… you’ll like it here.

I turned, slow as ice forming, but the corridor behind me was gone. Only black. Only the hum.

And then the hum stopped.

For a heartbeat, there was nothing — no sound, no air, no ship. Just silence so perfect it pressed against my eardrums like a physical thing.

And in that silence, I stepped forward.

Not because I wanted to. Not because I was forced. But because something deep inside me finally understood — this was where I was meant to go.

The frost cracked under my weight. The cold wrapped up to my chest. My fingertips reached for the hatch frame.

The last thing I felt was the pressure break — the air rushing past me — and the sensation of countless hands, far colder than the void, catching me before the stars swallowed me whole.

I woke up before my alarm. Not because I couldn’t sleep — I slept fine — but because my brain had already reminded me what day it was. Launch day.

I rolled over, rubbed my eyes, and checked the wall calendar. Big red circle around today’s date with one word in the middle: Go. If I were late, Halvorsen would make sure I regretted it. He hated anything that even hinted at “lack of discipline.”

I swung my legs out of bed and headed for the shower, letting the hot water wake me up. No breakfast. My stomach was already tied in knots, but not from fear — from adrenaline. Getting into the Orion IV was everything I’d trained for. Everything I wanted.

The air outside was sharp and cold. A line of low clouds hung over the horizon like they were watching me leave.

The transport took me straight to the mission headquarters. I barely had time to drop my bag before an assistant told me Halvorsen wanted to see me alone. When he shut the door, I knew it wasn’t going to be a routine pep talk. His eyes were heavy, his voice low.

“Before you go,” he began, “there’s something you need to know. The ship you’re taking—Orion IV—it’s been up there before. Three times. And three people died. None of them made it back.”

I let out a short laugh. “You make it sound like a ghost story.”

“It’s not a joke, Shay. We couldn’t explain any of it. The data vanished. Communications dropped. And…” He hesitated. “…we found one suit torn apart.”

“And no one else is willing to step on that ship except me and Peter, right?”

He gave a slow nod.

“Then don’t worry. I’m coming back.” I walked out before he could try to change my mind.

Outside, the launch pad was alive with camera flashes and reporters shouting over one another.

“Three brave people risked their lives for this company,” one of them called out. “What makes you different, Shay? Why are you so confident you’ll return when they didn’t?”

I barely broke stride. “Maybe they just didn’t have the strength to survive. I do.”

Peter fell into step beside me, giving me a sideways look. “Confident much?”

“Better than walking in scared,” I said.

He snorted. “Yeah. Maybe that’s what gets you killed.”

DAY ONE

The launch morning smelled like machine oil and burnt coffee.

I could feel the vibration of the cargo loader through the soles of my boots before I even stepped onto the boarding ramp. Orion IV loomed in front of me — not some gleaming sci-fi cruiser, but a working ship. The hull plating was dull gray, pitted in places where micrometeorites had kissed it over the years. Faded stenciling marked the ship’s registry and hazard warnings. The forward observation dome caught the sun like a blind eye.

Peter was already at the base of the ramp, leaning against a supply crate, sipping from a dented steel thermos.

“Morning,” he said without looking up.

“Morning,” I replied, pulling my bag higher on my shoulder. “She’s bigger than I thought.”

Peter smirked. “She’s uglier than you thought, too, admit it.”

I looked up at the Orion again, her heavy thruster housings jutting like shoulders. “Ugly’s fine. As long as she holds together.”

“She will. Mostly.”

Inside, the ship smelled different — cleaner, but in a way that told you the air was filtered, recycled. The lighting strips along the corridor hummed faintly. Everything had a layer of matte paint to cut glare, and the narrow passageways forced you to turn your shoulders to pass certain bulkheads.

Peter showed me to my cabin — a narrow compartment with a single bunk, a wall locker, and a small desk bolted to the wall. The mattress was wrapped in plastic.

“Welcome home,” he said.

“It’s… cozy.”

“That’s one word for it. Just don’t expect room service.”

We spent the morning running pre-flight checks. That meant walking through the engineering bay — a cramped jungle of pipes, heat exchangers, and access panels — and listening to Peter mutter to himself as he ticked items off the maintenance slate. The main reactor hummed deep in the belly of the ship, a constant low vibration that I felt through my hands when I touched the bulkhead.

By noon, the engines were warming. The ship shuddered as the docking clamps released. Through the observation dome, Earth slid slowly away, a blue-and-white marble wrapped in black.

Peter leaned beside me, his hands in his pockets. “Last chance to change your mind.”

“I’m fine.”

He studied me a moment longer than felt casual. “Alright then.”

Lunch was heat-pouched protein stew, eaten at the mess table in near silence except for the hiss of the CO₂ scrubbers. I caught myself glancing over my shoulder more than once, though I couldn’t have said why.

The voices started small that evening. Not whispers, exactly — more like faint bursts of static from a radio, but carrying the suggestion of syllables. I heard them while brushing my teeth in the tiny head compartment. I froze, foam in my mouth, listening.

Nothing.

Peter passed by in the corridor and glanced in. “Something wrong?”

I shook my head. “Thought I heard… Never mind.”

We turned in early. Lying in my bunk, I felt the ship’s vibration through the thin mattress, a steady heartbeat that filled the silence. Somewhere in that hum, faintly, something said my name.

DAY TWO

I woke to the dim blue glow of the cabin’s night-cycle lighting. For a moment, I wasn’t sure what had pulled me out of sleep — the ship’s hum was constant, but there was something else. A faint, high-pitched sound, like someone exhaling right against my ear. I sat up, listening hard. It stopped.

The morning routine was cramped and mechanical. The head compartment was barely wide enough to turn around in. The water from the tap was lukewarm, metallic-tasting. Breakfast was freeze-dried eggs, reconstituted in a cup with water from the galley dispenser, and two hard biscuits.

Peter was already on his second cup of coffee.

“You’re up early,” he said without looking at me.

“Couldn’t sleep.”

“That’s normal, the first few nights. You’ll adjust to the ship’s rhythm.”

We ran diagnostics on the nav systems. The Orion’s bridge wasn’t like the ones in recruitment brochures — more like a cluttered workshop with display screens bolted at odd angles, their casings scratched and worn. The captain’s chair had a patch on the armrest where the vinyl had split, exposing yellow foam.

By midday, the hum of the engines had settled into a pattern I almost didn’t notice — until I caught myself tapping my fingers in time with it. Peter saw me doing it.

“Ship’s getting into your head already,” he said with a faint grin.

“I guess.”

He didn’t stop watching me until I turned away.

We ate lunch in the mess again. The food was fine, but it all had that faint aftertaste of the air’s dryness. I found myself drinking more water than usual. The condensation unit hummed softly in the corner, its drip-drip-drip almost like a clock.

That afternoon, we did a maintenance walk-through. In the aft service corridor, the lighting flickered twice, just long enough for my eyes to adjust to the darkness and think I saw someone at the far end. I blinked, and it was just the sealed hatch to the cargo hold.

Back in my cabin, I sat at the desk and tried to read from my datapad. Every few minutes, I thought I heard something outside the door — a shuffle, or maybe fabric brushing metal. When I finally got up and checked, the corridor was empty.

That night, the voices came back, clearer than before. Not words I could make out, but a rhythm — something that felt like language, if I could just listen harder. I lay there, heart beating fast, until I heard Peter moving in the corridor. I opened my door.

“Peter,” I said softly.

He stopped. “You hear it too, don’t you?”

I didn’t answer.

He nodded once, then kept walking.

DAY THREE

The third morning, I woke before the ship’s internal chronometers signaled wake cycle. The dim lights in the corridor were still on night mode, casting everything in shades of gray-blue.

In the galley, Peter was already there, spooning porridge from a steaming pouch into a bowl. He looked tired, his eyes shadowed.

“You’re up early again,” I said.

“Couldn’t sleep,” he replied flatly.

We spent the morning in the forward maintenance bay. The space smelled faintly of ozone from the electrical panels, and the walls sweated condensation in the corners. We checked the hull sensors — all clear — and recalibrated the thermal regulators.

By midday, I noticed something strange: the voices didn’t only come at night. While crouched under a panel in engineering, I heard them again, faint and rapid, just under the sound of the coolant pumps. Peter froze, too, his wrench still in his hand.

“They don’t like it when we talk about them,” he whispered.

My skin prickled. “Who’s ‘they’?”

He just shook his head and went back to work.

Lunch was protein noodles with soy sauce from a little foil packet. I barely tasted it; the mess felt different, as though the air was thicker somehow. The hum of the ship sounded less steady, like there was something behind it, breathing with us.

That evening, Peter suggested a walk through the observation dome. From there, the stars were endless, a field of cold fire stretching in all directions. For a few minutes, the beauty of it drowned out everything else.

Then I saw something move — not outside, but in the reflection of the glass. A shadow that didn’t belong to either of us.

DAY FOUR

I woke from a dream I couldn’t remember, only the feeling — like someone had been leaning over my bunk, watching me sleep. My throat was dry, my lips stuck together. The air recyclers hummed like a slow breath above my head.

The corridor outside my cabin was icy. My breath didn’t fog, but I felt the chill in my bones. I pulled on a thermal shirt before heading to the galley.

Peter was there, but he didn’t greet me. He was sitting hunched over a cup of coffee, both hands around it like it was the only warm thing left in the ship. His eyes followed me without moving his head.

“You ever think about what’s between here and there?” he asked suddenly.

“What do you mean?”

“Between Earth and wherever we’re going. All that black. All that silence. Maybe it’s not empty.”

I tried to laugh. “I think I preferred it when I thought it was empty.”

He didn’t smile.

We spent the morning checking the communications array. It sat in a cramped alcove near the dorsal ridge of the ship, surrounded by panels full of blinking indicator lights. The metal walls here seemed thinner — I could hear the distant whine of the ship’s hull adjusting to microtemperature changes. Sometimes, that whine blended with the voices.

At one point, while Peter was rerouting a signal, I thought I heard my name — Shay — stretched out and low. It came from the wall itself, as if someone’s mouth were pressed to the metal on the other side. I stepped back, heart pounding.

Peter noticed. “Don’t listen too hard,” he said quietly.

Lunch was rice and rehydrated vegetables. I ate quickly, my appetite getting smaller every day. Peter picked at his food, barely touching it. We were both drinking more water than before — the air was so dry now that it made my skin itch.

That evening, we walked through the ship’s main corridor toward engineering. The walls felt narrower than before. Halfway down, the lights flickered, and in that split second of darkness, I saw shapes — tall, thin outlines — just far enough away that I couldn’t see their faces. When the light came back, the corridor was empty.

Peter kept walking like nothing had happened.

That night, I dreamed of the Orion’s corridors stretching far beyond their real dimensions, branching into paths I’d never seen before, all leading downward. I woke to find I was gripping my blanket so tightly my fingers hurt.

DAY FIVE

The first thing I noticed that morning was the smell — a faint, sweet rot that wasn’t there before. I followed it to the air vents in the corridor. When I leaned close, I could swear I heard the faint sound of someone breathing inside the ductwork.

Peter was in the mess, cutting open a pouch of oatmeal. He didn’t look up when I entered.

“You smell it too?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said. “It’s not coming from the food.”

“Then where—”

“Don’t ask.”

We spent the morning in engineering, checking coolant flow rates. The reactor chamber was hotter than usual, the heat pressing against my skin even through the thick coveralls. The voices were louder here, as if the hum of the reactor carried them up from somewhere deep in the ship.

While I was logging the readings, Peter leaned close enough for me to feel his breath on my ear.

“They’re getting bolder,” he whispered. “Last night, one of them spoke clear as day.”

“What did it say?”

He straightened. “It asked me to open the airlock.”

Lunch was barely edible — some kind of protein loaf with a tangy sauce. I forced it down, feeling watched the whole time. The mess’s walls seemed to press closer, the lights harsher. I kept glancing at the doorway, expecting someone — or something-to walk in.

That afternoon, we passed the cargo hold. The hatch was sealed, but I heard movement inside — slow, deliberate footsteps, then silence. Peter didn’t stop walking.

That night, I heard the voices again, but now they were in my cabin, not the walls. They circled the bunk, whispering in a language I couldn’t understand, but their tone was clear: they were amused.

DAY SIX

I didn’t sleep.

At breakfast, Peter’s eyes were bloodshot, and he had a small cut along his cheekbone. When I asked, he said, “Ran into something in the corridor.”

“What kind of something?”

“Not sure it was there when I looked.”

The day’s task was hull inspection — a walk through the narrow outer maintenance passages, where the walls curved with the ship’s body and the sound of our boots echoed endlessly. The light here was dimmer, the air colder.

Halfway through, we came to an access point for an exterior viewport. The glass was frosted with micro-impacts, but through it I saw a shadow against the stars. Not a ship. Not debris. Something vaguely human-shaped, drifting alongside us, keeping pace.

I didn’t say anything. Neither did Peter.

Lunch was silent. The mess felt wrong, like someone had rearranged things while we were gone — the chairs just slightly off-angle, the table closer to the wall than before.

That evening, while walking to my cabin, I saw a figure ahead. It looked like Peter, but it turned the corner without acknowledging me. When I reached the corner, the corridor was empty. A moment later, the honest Peter stepped out from engineering behind me.

That night, I locked my cabin door for the first time.

DAY SEVEN

The Orion IV’s artificial morning came and went without me noticing. I’d been awake for hours, listening. The voices weren’t in the walls anymore — they were inside the room, moving from one corner to another, their whispers rising and falling like the tide.

Peter met me in the mess. He didn’t look good. His hands shook when he poured coffee, and he’d stopped trying to hide it. His eyes kept darting to the ventilation grilles.

“They don’t like the lights,” he said. “I kept mine on all night.”

I didn’t tell him I’d done the same, or that it hadn’t helped.

We were supposed to check the starboard coolant manifold that day, but the ship had changed. The corridor leading there seemed longer, the curve more gradual. I swear I counted fifty-seven paces more than yesterday. The air was heavier, too, like we were walking through a place that didn’t want us moving forward.

Halfway there, we passed a bulkhead hatch with a viewport. On the other side, the lights were out. Shapes moved in the darkness, tall and swaying, like reeds in deep water. Peter quickened his pace, and I followed without a word.

At lunch, neither of us touched the food. It wasn’t the smell, though that had worsened, a syrupy rot in every breath — it was the way the protein loaf seemed to pulse slightly, like it was breathing. I pushed my tray away. Peter had already done the same.

That night, the voices stopped whispering. They began humming. Low, deep, and so resonant I felt it in my teeth. I covered my ears, but it was inside my head now.

DAY EIGHT

I found Peter in engineering before the lights came on. He was standing at the reactor console, staring into the heat shimmer through the shielding glass.

“They want me to go outside,” he said, voice calm, almost casual. “They say they’ll show me what’s keeping pace with us.”

I told him not to listen. He smiled — not like he was happy, but like he knew something I didn’t.

The air felt damp that day. Condensation beaded on the corridor walls. My boots squeaked on the decking. Somewhere deep in the ship, something was dripping.

We checked environmental controls, but the humidity reading was normal. While I was logging the diagnostics, Peter leaned on the console, his head tilted as if he was listening to something far away.

“They know your name,” he said. “They say it differently, but it’s still you.”

Dinner was impossible. The food looked fine, smelled fine, but every bite was like chewing paper soaked in cold water. My stomach turned. Peter didn’t even try.

I went back to my cabin early. The humming came again, but this time it wasn’t from the voices — it came from the ship. Every panel, every bulkhead, every screw and seam vibrated with it. It didn’t stop until I fell into a dreamless sleep.

DAY NINE

I woke to knocking. Not on the door — from inside the wall behind my bunk. Slow, deliberate, and too heavy to be the sound of metal cooling.

Peter wasn’t in the mess. I found him in the corridor near the airlock. The inner hatch was sealed, but he was standing close enough that his breath fogged the glass.

“They’re waiting,” he said. His voice was raw, like he’d been shouting. “They’re so much closer now.”

I tried to pull him away, but he didn’t resist, just followed me back to engineering. We didn’t talk after that.

The ship was darker today, the lighting a fraction dimmer than usual. Or maybe my eyes were just struggling to adjust. In the observation bay, I saw them again — the shadow shapes outside, moving with us. There were more now. Many more.

That night, I locked my cabin, shoved my chair under the handle, and sat awake with the lights on. The voices were speaking again, not humming. And this time, I understood a few words.

We are here.

Let us in.

DAY TEN

I didn’t remember leaving my bunk, but I was in the corridor when the artificial morning came on. My head ached. My hands were stiff and cold.

Peter was gone. Not in his cabin. Not in engineering. Not anywhere the ship’s internal sensors could locate.

The airlock’s inner hatch was ajar. The panel beside it read MANUAL OVERRIDE ENGAGED. I stepped closer. The outer hatch was sealed, but frost had formed along the edges of the glass. I wiped it away with my sleeve.

Something was out there. Not floating now — pressed against the viewing pane. Its skin, if that’s what it was, was the same dull gray as the void behind it. The face was long and stretched, with features that were too narrow to be human. Its mouth moved, and I heard Peter’s voice in my head.

It’s better here.

I staggered back, but the lights went out before I could run. Total darkness. And in that darkness, the sound of many hands — wet, cold hands — touching the walls all around me.

When the lights came back on, the corridor was empty. The airlock yawned open before me, a dark mouth breathing cold into the corridor. My breath came in shallow bursts, each one smoking in the frigid air. The frost on the deck plates spread beneath my boots in branching veins, crackling faintly as it crept toward me.

The voices were louder now — no longer whispers, words, just a thousand throats humming one endless, hollow note. It was in my chest, in my bones, vibrating the fillings in my teeth.

I tried to turn away, but my feet wouldn’t obey. My muscles strained, trembling under my own weight, but something unseen had hooked itself into me — not my skin, deeper—and was drawing me forward inch by inch.

The thing beyond the hatch pressed closer to the glass. Its eyes — black pools without light — widened in slow recognition. Its mouth opened wider than any mouth should, jaw unhinging until it was just a black tunnel leading into nothing.

Cold spilled over the threshold and wrapped itself around my ankles like water. My knees buckled. I reached for the bulkhead, fingers brushing the smooth metal, but it was slick with something that wasn’t condensation. My hand came away wet, and the smell hit me — salt, copper, rot.

From somewhere beyond the void, Peter’s voice cut through the hum. Not from the thing outside, not from the walls — but right behind me.

Shay… you’ll like it here.

I turned, slow as ice forming, but the corridor behind me was gone. Only black. Only the hum.

And then the hum stopped.

For a heartbeat, there was nothing — no sound, no air, no ship. Just silence, so perfect it pressed against my eardrums like a physical thing.

And in that silence, I stepped forward.

Not because I wanted to. Not because I was forced. But because something deep inside me finally understood, this was where I was meant to go.

The frost cracked under my weight. The cold wrapped up to my chest. My fingertips reached for the hatch frame.

The last thing I felt was the pressure break — the air rushing past me — and the sensation of countless hands, far colder than the void, catching me before the stars swallowed me whole.

I (19 F) have a friend we will call Ashley (20 F). We have been friends for about 3 years. This whole situation stemmed from us going into the smoke shop and my card declining. She offered to pay for what I had which came to about $40. I was very grateful and I thought that was super nice. 

When we get into the car she says, “Just let me know when you are going to pay me back.” In the moment I just said “Oh ok.” 

Now that I’ve home I thought about it. Every time we go out, I drive, pay for gas (obviously), pay for our drinks whenever we get coffee, and I take her everywhere she possibly asked, even if it’s out of the way. If anything I think that her paying for that was just her repaying me for the things I’ve done for her. 

Maybe I’m just being crazy and I am completely in the wrong. But I just feel as though this is very one sided and usually I get the short end of the stick. ",1,1754883674.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

I Browsed Alibaba and found a small factory in Vietnam with decent reviews, messaged the seller, and placed a small order.  
  
Everything went smoothly. Good communication, quick turnaround and the product looked great.  
  
But then, after the order shipped, I got a message.   
  
It was the factory owner, saying thanks for the order and sending a few behind-the-scenes photos of the production process. Workers packing boxes. A few half-printed phone cases on a drying rack.   
He included a short note:  
  
“Hope your customers like them. My team enjoyed working on your design!”  
  
I thought it was a nice touch, so I replied with a thank-you and shared a photo of the finished display at the event.  
  
Next thing I know, he’s asking about life in the U.S. what our schools are like, how small businesses survive here, whether I have to deal with power outages like they do sometimes in his area. I replied, and we kept chatting.  
  
We moved from Alibaba messages to WhatsApp. He sent more photos his workshop, his family, his motorbike, his lunch one afternoon. I sent back a few pics of my work-from-home setup, our neighborhood coffee shop, and my son’s Little League game.  
  
Now, this has been going on for eight months.  
  
He sent me photos from his daughter’s graduation last month. I sent him a video of my kid hitting a home run. We compare notes on dealing with difficult customers and joke about the challenges of running small businesses. He taught me how to say “hello” and “thank you” in Vietnamese (I’m still working on pronunciation), and I’ve been helping him understand random English idioms like “hit the ground running” and “throw in the towel.”  
  
And through it all, we’re still doing business together. He’s become my go-to person for any custom manufacturing needs, not because he’s the cheapest, but because I trust him completely. When you know someone personally, the whole dynamic changes.  
  
It’s wild how a simple business transaction turned into this genuine, long-distance friendship. He’s invited me to visit Vietnam, and honestly I’m considering it. Never thought I’d have a close friend I’ve never met in person who lives 10,000 miles away.  
  
Makes me think about how rare it is to slow down and actually connect with someone you work with - especially in e-commerce, where it’s so easy to treat people like usernames or tracking numbers.

You look at the menu. Decide what you want. Tell the waiter.  
You don’t apologise for wanting extra cheese.  
You don’t follow the waiter into the kitchen to make sure they didn’t forget you.  
You don’t nervously say, “Oh… just bring me whatever’s easiest” because you’re afraid to want too much.

But when it comes to money, success, or opportunities?  
Most people do *exactly* that.

They whisper their dreams to the universe like they’re embarrassed to be hungry.

They start bold:

“I want $5,000 for my emergency fund.”  
Then they start shrinking:  
“Actually… maybe $3,000. Or $1,500. You know what, never mind.”

That’s like ordering a steak and then telling the waiter you’ll just take the scraps from the kitchen.

**Here’s the truth:**

The universe is basically cosmic room service. It’s not judging your order. It’s not thinking, *Who do they think they are wanting abundance?*

It just delivers whatever you clearly and confidently request, if you stop changing your mind every five minutes.

**The “Menu Method” for Manifestation**

1. **Get ridiculously specific.** Not “more money” say “$2,000 by the end of the month.” Not “a new car” describe the make, model, color, and exactly how you’ll feel driving it.
2. **Order like you mean it.** Just like you’d say, “I’ll have the salmon, please,” say:“I’ll have the promotion, please.” “I’ll have financial freedom, please.” No mumbling. No apologising.
3. **Trust the kitchen.** You don’t stand by the chef asking if they forgot your order. So stop stalking your manifestation with doubt and panic. Relax, it’s cooking.
4. **Be open to surprise.** Sometimes you order salmon and the chef sends something even better. Abundance can arrive through unexpected people, timing, or opportunities. Don’t reject it just because it looks different than you pictured.

**Avoid “Order Anxiety.”**  
In a restaurant, sitting there worrying the whole time your food won’t come is exhausting — and unnecessary.  
Same in life.

Instead, use **happy customer energy**: that relaxed, excited certainty that something delicious is on its way.

**Your challenge this week:**  
Order one *small* thing from the universe.  
Maybe a $20 bill. A random discount. A free coffee.

Go through the full process:

* Be specific.
* Order with confidence.
* Trust it’s coming.
* Stay open to how it arrives.

Once you see it work on a small scale, you’ll trust it with the bigger stuff.

Nature doesn’t apologise for millions of flowers.  
The ocean doesn’t feel bad for being massive.  
The stars don’t dim themselves because they’re “too much.”

Abundance is the default setting of the universe and you’re part of it.

The restaurant of life? Open 24/7.  
The menu? Infinite.  
Your table? Already reserved.

So stop standing outside, staring at the menu.  
Take your seat. Place your order. Claim your feast.

I’ve been a part-time forex trader for the past 6 years, doing both manual trading and running EAs. While I enjoy the markets, I’ve realised that trading alone can be *pretty lonely* — most of the time it’s just me, my charts, and a cup of coffee at odd hours.

I’m looking to connect with other like-minded traders, share ideas, discuss strategies, and maybe even explore opportunities to collaborate.

Whether you’re trading full-time, part-time, manually, or with bots — I think it’d be great to have a close-knit group where we can:

* Share market analysis and trade ideas
* Talk about strategies (and mistakes we’ve learned from)
* Keep each other motivated and accountable
* Just have some good trader-to-trader conversations

If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM me and we can start a small group to chat, exchange ideas, and maybe even become trading buddies.

After all, the markets are unpredictable — but having good people around doesn’t have to be.

We were planning to stay there for 2 weeks, the first night me and my friend were playing games on my friends ps2 in the living room/ kitchen, there was this portrait that was hanging on the wall next to the tv of my friends cousin it creeped me out because it was one of those where the eyes follow you, anyways after playing for 3 hours we decided to sleep in the living room while i was sleeping i woke up around 2:45 AM it sounded like somebody was crumpling a piece of paper right up against my ear but i could clearly see there was nothing there, i was frozen in fear it went on for 10 minutes suddenly after it stopped i heard footsteps walking around the couch i slept on, after that i heard loud thumping from the  sealing like someone was stomping on the ceiling luckily it stopped there at some point i fell asleep. I asked my friend the next day about the thumping he told me it was just rats or mice, but i know theres no way thats true.

the next night we slept in the bedroom, there are 2 beds in each corner of the roomone faces the door while the other is not and there is a built in wardrobe blocking the view, my friend insisted that i take the bed facing the door, that night i was lying in bed and watched the door handle slowly move like someone was trying to open the door then suddenly it opened and the room got ice cold, luckily that was all that happened. the next night our power went out and my friends dad told us to make coffee, as me and my friend walked down the hallway we heard somebody walking behind us but when we turned to look there was nobody there and when we called out to his dad he was on the other side of the house, not long after he told me that one night  after he went to bed he saw a shadow of a old lady standing next to his bed staring at him and walked off into the hall way and vanished he said that most likely the door of the bedroom and the thing i heard walking behind us was most likely that old lady. i asked if there was a way to avoid having that terrifying stuff happen, he told me to go to bed before anybody else and it worked nothing else happened for the rest of the time i was there, but after i got back home my friend told me he didn't want to freak me out but when we hear foot steps behind us he turned around first and saw a tall shadow figure standing behind me",4,1754883034.0,TrueScaryStories,0,0.84,False

\
Alt text: Business people in a professional meeting.*\
The Kingdom of Bahrain continues to outpace regional rivals with its pro-business reforms. Recent 2025 data from Reuters confirms FDI inflows have grown by 8% YOY, driven especially by fintech, manufacturing, and logistics sectors. According to Forbes Business, Bahrain’s Economic Development Board (EDB) reports 19,650 new commercial registrations as of Q2 2025. Free zones, like Bahrain Investment Wharf and Bahrain Logistics Zone, are at near-capacity.\
Why the surge?\
\
100% foreign ownership in most sectors (source)\
Cost-effective commercial registration (current pricing)\
Fast-track digital platforms such as Sijilat\
Diverse business entity types: WLL, SPC, BSC, Branch\
\
Importantly, authorities have streamlined tax and compliance structures to attract more SMEs and multinationals. Bahrain’s business regulations are being harmonized with GCC neighbors, but the Kingdom keeps a unique flexibility—longer grace periods, more support from Tamkeen, and a generally more relationship-based approach in enforcement.\
\
How Often Are Companies Audited in Bahrain? The Real-World Answer\
Audit Frequency: Statutory and Surprise Inspections\
\
Short answer: Most private companies are only mandatorily audited once annually (via financial statements), but regulatory spot audits and sector-specific inspections can occur unpredictably.\
\
Annual Audits\
\
Mandatory: All Public and most private (WLL, SPC, BSC) entities must submit audited financials each year (per MOICT Law 21/2001).\
Who reviews? Ministry of Industry & Commerce (MOICT), with additional oversight for regulated sectors (e.g., CBB for finance).\
Audit cycle: Fiscal year-end, with up to 4 months after year close to file.\
\
Spot Checks and Special Inspections\
However, Bahrain's authorities reserve the right to spot-inspect any company at any time. This can be triggered by:\
\
Tax/VAT anomalies (LMRA, MOICT, NBR)\
Employee visa or labor law concerns (LMRA audits)\
Sectoral enforcement sweeps (food safety, e-commerce compliance, AML/CFT in finance)\
Random selection or whistleblower complaints\
\
In my experience—having guided over a dozen clients through the 2023-2025 period—routine spot audits are rare for SMEs with clean records, but can be frequent for companies with high staff turnover, unusual transactions, or flagged in risk sector lists. Large companies and licensed entities (banks, insurance, investment) face stricter quarterly compliance reviews.\
Personal aside: One of my ventures in the Seef District got flagged for a random VAT reconciliation check. I’d always heard about the “five-minute LMRA blitz”, but experiencing it? A sharp knock, two suited inspectors, and a whirlwind of questions before coffee break. Prepping all documents in advance saved me hours; it really pays to have digital backups and a designated compliance binder.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Regulatory Landscape: What’s Changed?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.) to trigger field audits, especially in high-growth sectors like e-commerce and logistics.\
- Stricter Beneficial Owner Disclosure: All entities must update real UBO records quarterly.\
- Expanded VAT Scope: Digital services and cross-border e-commerce now included, making audit triggers more likely for tech ventures.\
Practical implications: If your company’s revenue swings by more than 30% YOY, or there are frequent director changes, the e-Audit system may flag you for a review. Don’t rely on old checklists—use digital accounting and automated compliance tracking from day one.\
\
Compliance: What Do Bahrain Authorities Check During an Audit?\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.*\
Bahrain’s audit authorities check:\
\
Annual financial statements (audited)\
VAT and tax compliance documentation\
Employee visas, LMRA files, wage protection compliance (for >5 staff)\
Real offices with physical presence (Virtual offices flagged in 2024 as non-compliant for regulated businesses)\
Statutory registers: UBO, shareholders, directors, AGM minutes\
\
Common mistake: Over-relying on a single “company file” and not keeping digital backups. (I made this error once—an air conditioning failure fried my paper archives right before an MOICT spot check. Now, I scan and store everything in a secure cloud vault.)\
Audit Triggers: What Flags Your Company?\
\
Sudden revenue spikes/drops\
Unpaid VAT or late tax returns\
Complaints from suppliers or customers\
Unusual cross-border transactions\
Operating from non-registered addresses\
\
\
Business Types & Audit Risk: WLL, SPC, BSC, Free Zones\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.*\
\
WLL & SPC: Must submit annual audits, spot checks rare unless in high-risk sectors.\
BSC (Closed/Public): Subject to quarterly reviews, CBB compliance if in finance.\
Branch/Subsidiary: Treated as local for audit but flagged if group transactions are large.\
Free Zone companies: EDB zone authorities may conduct additional inspections, especially for logistics and manufacturing.\
\
Insider tip: If you’re registering a company and want to minimize audit headaches, consider a WLL with a strong local address, streamline your VAT filings, and attend MOICT orientation briefings (usually at the Diplomatic Area MOICT tower—booking a morning slot avoids post-lunch queues).\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting For Audits and Compliance\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.*\
Standard Compliance Costs (2025)\
\
Annual audit by licensed Bahraini auditor: BHD 500 - BHD 1,800 (varies by company size)\
Statutory government fees (CR renewal, MOICT): BHD 150 - BHD 400/year\
Bookkeeping/outsourced accounting: BHD 100 - BHD 500/month (see options)\
LMRA & Sijilat fees: Company activity-dependent, but budget BHD 50 - BHD 200/year extra\
\
If flagged for an in-depth audit, expect one-off advisory/legal costs of BHD 800 - BHD 2,000.\
Time- and Money-Saving Tips\
\
Appoint a local “compliance champion”—someone who knows LMRA, Sijilat, and MOICT workflows.\
Use cloud accounting software with Bahraini tax/VAT modules (Zoho, QuickBooks, or even better—a locally partnered firm that will answer calls on Fridays).\
Prepare all documents at calendar year-end, not fiscal—Ramadan and Eid holidays can mean crucial delays if you leave it last minute (I learned this the hard way in 2022 when my auditor was vacationing in London over Eid).\
\
\
The Audit Process: What To Expect and How To Prepare\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.*\
Pre-Audit Prep\
Get your ducks in a row:\
\
Prepare digital and hardcopy files: Statutory registers, VAT returns, bank statements, payroll, tenancy contracts.\
Notify your auditor: Schedule the annual review at least 4 weeks before deadline.\
Practice a majlis-style readiness: Bahrainis appreciate in-person coffee meetings, not just email chains. Offering Arabic coffee can go a surprising way during inspection meetings—even with non-Arabic staffers!\
\
During Audit/Inspection\
\
Inspector will typically give 24-48 hours’ notice (except for surprise labor visits).\
They will focus on compliance, not micromanagement—if your paperwork and digital logs are clean, it’s a 30-minute process.\
Networking tip: Build a good working relationship with local MOICT or LMRA desk officers. They often give early alerts about “sector sweeps.”\
\
Aftermath: Responding to Audit Findings\
\
Most findings are minor: late filings, missing register entries, feedback to correct within 2-4 weeks.\
Serious findings: Fines can range BHD 100 - BHD 2,500, but rarely escalate unless repeated offenses.\
\
Common Mistake Entrepreneurs Make\
Not budgeting for compliance costs upfront, or treating audits as “one-off” events. Bahrain’s approach is relationship- and reputation-based. If your company is known for transparency, you’re less likely to be flagged or fined.\
\
Bahrain Company Ownership, Free Zones, and Local Sponsorship\
\
Explore: 100% Foreign Ownership in Bahrain, Local Sponsorship Options\
\
Key Points\
\
Most sectors allow 100% foreign ownership—bypassing the need for local sponsors.\
Free zones offer additional tax breaks but have extra compliance layers (zone audits, customs).\
Local sponsors may help in navigating unofficial hurdles, speeding up documentation at Sijilat or CR counters.\
\
UAE and Saudi Arabia comparison? Bahrain offers faster setup, lower labor costs, and friendlier regulatory grace periods. But—UAE has more mature venture funding; Saudi can scale faster for industrial operations.\
My Challenge (and Solution):\
During my first CR renewal, I miscalculated the Ramadan holiday schedule and nearly missed filing deadlines. Solution? I now maintain a Bahraini public holidays watchlist and set CR renewal reminders one month earlier than the official deadline. Saved me a massive fine and days of bureaucratic wrangling.\
\
Off-Topic (But Actually Helpful!): Networking During Audit Season\
It might sound strange, but some of my most profitable deals came from networking outside the audit halls themselves. During the long waits at the MOICT Diplomatic Area building, I struck up a conversation with a café owner who later became a partner in a logistics venture. In Bahrain, business is as much about relationships—majlis visits, coffee service rituals—as it is about paperwork. Don’t neglect the “soft” side when prepping for compliance.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Audits & Compliance (2025 Edition)\
1. How long do Bahrain company audits take?\
Most annual financial audits are completed in 1-3 weeks if records are in order. Spot inspections by MOICT or LMRA can be over in 30 minutes, provided all documents are ready. Speed depends heavily on your auditor’s responsiveness and whether you pre-schedule during the “off-peak” months (avoid Ramadan/Eid).\
2. What triggers a Bahraini authority audit?\
Triggers include late/incorrect VAT filings, sudden revenue swings, employee visa compliance issues, whistleblower reports, or random sectoral sweeps based on e-Audit system. Sectors flagged for 2025: digital commerce, logistics, financial services.\
3. What are the main compliance costs?\
\
Annual audit: BHD 500-1,800\
Bookkeeping: BHD 100-500/month\
CR/miscellaneous fees: BHD 150-400/year\
See this for full breakdown: Bahrain Company Formation Cost\
\
4. Can I delay my audit or CR renewal?\
Short extensions may be possible, but penalties apply. Plan at least 1 month ahead; use a renewal calendar and local admin support for timely reminders. (Process overview)\
5. What’s the best resource for new founders?\
I recommend Keylink’s company formation service: clear fees, proactive compliance reminders, and English/Arabic support. For sector-specific questions, MOICT’s Sijilat portal and the EDB’s official business portal are invaluable.\
\
Final Thoughts\
Bahrain’s audit landscape balances robust regulation with genuine business friendliness. The system rewards clear records, anticipatory compliance, and proactive relationship-building. If you prepare, budget, and network wisely, audits become just another step in your growth journey—not a lurking threat.\
Adopt a Bahraini coffee culture mindset: be ready, be open, and don’t rush the process. Your business—and your peace of mind—will thank you.\

Each module was an hour long. I couldn’t believe what was happening. This is hell, I’m trapped in a boring ass, shitty job, I had modules to complete that can last decades. Papers upon papers to read and sign my signature on. I went along with the insanity of this, maybe, once the day was done, I could just clock out. I will be able to leave this bullshit, go home, and not come back. Finally, 5 PM came, and I was able to leave this nonsense. I went over to the clock out machine to clock out with my magical badge that appeared on me. I took a deep breath in/out, smiled, and clocked myself out.

The machine went from 5 PM to 9 AM the instant I pressed my badge to the sensor.

“Good morning! Mr. Thomas!” Major Tom announced excitingly, “Ready for another day of work! I love my job!”

“Wait,” I responded in shock, “I’m supposed to be clocked out. I’m supposed to leave.”

“You clock in, then you clock out, then you clock in,” Major Tom explained, “you’ll get used to it.”

“What!?” I exclaimed, “I can’t even leave this place when I’m done!”

“Not until you finish your modules and paperwork,” Major Tom answered.

“That’ll take me thousands and thousands of years!” I shouted, “I have 100s of thousands of modules and the stack of papers gets higher and higher!”

“I believe in you, my friend, I can relate, I gotta a lot of work too,” he said.

“I can’t leave! I’ve seen you leave back to your house!”

“That’s another Major Tom, he's a different Major Tom for a different job,” Major Tom explained as he poured coffee into a tube in the fishbowl that led to his mouth, “I think the reason for so many Major Tom's is because the creator dislikes paperwork. That’s my theory. I don't know, I just work here.”

I ran back to my cubicle and sat there shaking. The withdrawal was starting to creep up on me and I needed a fix. I started to sweat, get sniffles, and my mind started to break. The aches and pains were starting to appear in my body. I needed to do a bump or I would smash that stupid fishbowl head of his. I hated that this prick surrounded me, that was the only person that was here besides the monster woman.

I started to begin the modules and paperwork to distract me from the withdrawal symptoms. It was endless, the more I completed, the more they popped up in my email. Emails and notifications kept pouring into my computer/phone like a flood of bureaucratic diarrhea. I signed and completed the documents/papers, but that felt useless because more papers just appeared on top of the pile like some never-ending Jenga tower. 

I tried reading the documents, but they were covered in endless legal jargon, abbreviations, and nonsensical run-on sentences. Some of the documents were in Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, and honestly, every language. A document can switch from one language to another in the middle of a paragraph. 

Sometimes, there were blank pages, a page in an unknown alien language that I couldn't recognize, a wet page, and scratches/redacted where words should be. I didn't even know what I was signing most of the time. I got up and walked to the bathroom, trying to avoid the infinite Major Toms. I was dazed and confused from the endless documents. The nasty withdrawal symptoms weren't helping, but making things much worse.

I decided to text my girlfriend while sitting on the toilet.

Me: Baby, you were right, I should have never taken the job.

Katie: oh shit, the guy must've been dangerous. Did you get shot? Stabbed? What happened?

Me: worse, I'm in some fucked up office space with infinite paperwork, modules, and Major Toms. Some psycho monster HR lady named Karen.

Katie: Are you screwing with me?

Me: NO! I NEED HELP! I AM IN THE BATHROOM!

Katie: what the fuck are you talking about?

Me: I AM BEING HELD HOSTAGE IN SOME STUPID, SHITTY OFFICE AGAINST MY WILL!

Katie: Why all caps?

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

“Excuse me, is there someone in there?” Major Tom asked.

I ignored the fishbowl wearing weirdo, hoping that he'd go away.

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

 “The coffee went through me pretty fast. I need to drop the kids off at the pool if you know what I mean,” Major Tom chuckled after a long silence.

Me: I am stuck with the fishbowl wearing asshat!

Katie: Are you on drugs?

Me: all he does is drink coffee through some stupid tube. ALL HIS JOKES SUCK ASS!

Katie: text me when your crazy high wears off

Me: HELP ME!

I walked out of the bathroom to the endless sterile, white cubicles and offices. The bathroom was on the only white wall in the office space. The wall extended to infinity with endless bathrooms. Why the hell did Major stupid ass face Tom bother me if there's literally infinite bathrooms?

“So, you were the one in the bathroom,” Major Tom said as he approached me, “you gotta answer when someone knocks you know.”

I gritted my teeth and walked away furiously to my desk. I was met with a pile of papers that extended all the way to the sky. I followed the paperwork up with my eyes and saw no ceiling. This place made no sense and every little detail was breaking my brain. How did it get so high if I was only gone for a few minutes?

“Wow! Try not to topple that over!” Major Tom exclaimed as stared at the massive paper pile, “the clean up crew of Major Tom's won't be too happy with the mess if that Mount Everest avalanche goes down.”

I faced Major Tom and glared at him furiously. He stared back with an emotionless straight face while pouring the coffee into his tube. I never paid attention, but his eyes were an odd color. One eye was silver and the other was brown. He always wore the same grey suit no matter what. I usually don't pay attention to the eyes and fashion of my targets. I did just now, who the hell was this guy?

I decided to study his file that my employer sent me for the assassination. Major Tom was born in free/North Panama, that doesn't exist, this guy is from some place that literally doesn't exist. When he went to work, he performed audits on the business, he didn't even work in the office. He was part of an agency called, “solar audit departments,” he worked for SAD. I searched for it on a search engine, but it doesn't exist. His birth date was over 100 years in the future. He shouldn't even exist. How did I not notice the nonsense in this guy's background?

“You are required to go to Mrs. Aza, our emotional therapist,” I raised my head to see Cosmic Karen standing over me.

“Yes, ma’am,” I replied as I got up to walk towards the white wall with the door labeled, “Mrs. Ava's office.”

I walked into the oddly comfortable room with a couch and a table. I slowly closed the door behind me. There was a computer screen with a straight red line. I sat on the couch and faced the screen. The walls were a different color, the walls were covered in rainbows, and cute animal cartoons. Am I in some kind of child playroom?

“Hello, Mr. Thomas, my name is Mrs. Aza,” a sweet robotic voice emitted from screen; the red line moved to the resonance of the voice, “this is a safe space, you're allowed to cry in here and you are allowed to express yourself however you like. I want you to be comfortable. You are allowed to even curse. Nothing leaves this room.”

“What the hell is going on?” I asked the screen.

“Well, I looked through your background and I see somebody who needs some morale support,” Mrs. Aza explained, “sometimes antisocial tendencies come from unresolved emotional pain due to childhood drama. I want to help you.”

“What?”

“I saw that you loved cookies as a child, so I baked you some,” Mrs. Aza said as cookies magically appeared on the table, “I understand, please tell me how you feel.”

“I feel like I'm going insane!” I screamed, “where the hell am I!? What the shit ass balls is this!?”

“Good, good, Mr. Thomas, screaming is always healthier than getting physical,” Mrs. Aza lectured sweetly, “this room is a safe space and sound proof.”

I grabbed the pillow on the couch and started screaming in it. I started breathing heavily as my face turned red. My face in my palms as I started to sweat.

“I understand, dear, I used to have antisocial tendencies too, I was at one point a blind, idiot who destroyed everything. My sons even left me,” Mrs. Aza said, “when I came to my senses. I saw the destruction of space and time. I felt really bad.”

“What did you do to fix it?” I asked as I slowly raised my head from my palms.

“I decided to get a PhD in psychology and become a licensed therapist,” she explained, “ I wanted to dedicate myself to helping others that were destroyed and destroyed around them. Help people become better versions of themselves.”

“By the way, Mrs. Aza, don't say that about yourself that you were blind or stupid because I think you're a very sweet intelligent person,” I told the screen.

“Awww! Thank you, dear! I'm rooting for you!” She replied.

“You welcome, I'm just not ready to confront these heavy emotions,” I said.

“That's ok, I will always be here when you're ready.”

“I would like to see you, I know you are not the screen,” I said.

“Well… I am sorry, Mr. Thomas,” Mrs. Aza replied softly, “if I show you my true form, then you might have a mental breakdown, or fall into a deep coma or psychosis. It's a safety hazard. It's counterproductive to what I want to do, which is to help others.”

“Ok, I understand, please don't call me Mr. Thomas, call me Sammy,” I told her.

“Of course, Sammy, it was a pleasure to meet you,” she said in the sweetest voice, “it's ok for you to leave, I will give you the full time.”

“Thank you, I'm gonna get a cookie,” I said.

I took a chocolate chip cookie and took a bite; this was the only normal thing in this crazy office. The cookie was delicious beyond belief, total heaven in my mouth, I was shocked by how good the cookie was. The cookie was perfectly crispy, the ratio of chocolate chip, and dough was well-balanced as all things should be. 

Even though the cookie was perfectly crispy, the middle oozed with chocolate lava goodness. For the first time in my life, I cried, I sobbed right in front of the screen. The cookie overwhelmed me, I could not believe a cookie could be that delicious. A box of tissues magically came floating towards me. I wiped my tears and blew my nose into a tissue.

“Oh, sweetheart, you are perfectly fine to cry in this safe space,” Mrs. Aza said through the screen with kindest cadence.

“Mrs. Aza, these cookies… are incredible,” I slowly admitted.

“Dear, thank you so much, I bake everything with love, sadly my sons don’t visit me anymore,” she solemnly replied, “I wish they would visit, so they can try my cookies.”

“Your sons need to appreciate you more, they are not nice to their sweet mother,” I defiantly said while shaking my head, “Where are they even? What’s more important than their own mother?”

“Well…”

“Well, what?” I asked.

“They are mostly going around universes assimilating planets, causing chaos, disorder, and corruption,” she awkwardly admitted, “but they are good boys. I will always have them in my heart.”

“Oh,” I replied, “I guess I’ll be going, thank you, Mrs. Aza.”

“I hope you come back and I will give your full time to HR,” she responded.

I walked out the door and closed it softly behind me. I turned and was jumpscared by Cosmic Karen. I jumped back in horror at the rings above her head, the constant blue eyes phasing in, and out. She had a huge toothy grin as she stared at me with wide eyes. Even the blue eye on her forehead stared at me wide eyed.

“How was it?” she asked.

“Good, ma’am,” I sheeplessly said while looking down.

“Fantastic!” she flew away back to her office.

I walked back to my desk and was met with another massive pile of paperwork that stretched to the ethereal ceiling that may or may not exist. There were now two massive piles of papers, documents, and folders of illogical garbage in front of me. I forgot where I was for a second in Mrs. Aza’s office. I forgot I was in the worst horror imaginable, a shitty, boring neverending job. I didn’t even apply for this! I am a hitman, former navy seal, but now I’m doing endless modules and signing unrecognizable forms. The withdrawal symptoms are nasty and I feel sick 24/7.

I decided that I will try to finish these modules and paperwork, so I can return home. I will claim my money and I will become victorious. I got to work, the hours turned to days, the days turned to weeks, then months, and….. I still have 100,000 modules to complete and 20 more paper piles appeared. The only reason why I know it has been months is because of my phone and the computer. Strangely enough, unlike most horror stories, I have wifi, internet connection, access to the outside world digitally, and I can charge my phone.

 It doesn’t matter, I’m trapped, the address doesn’t exist, it’s some bullshit like 0001111999 North Bollywood New York City Drive with the zip code of 667. 667, they just added one number, so I don’t even get anything actually scary. I don't even get demons. I get something worse than demons; paperwork, forms, red tape, Cosmic Karen, and Major Tom. Red tape, I can't do this, I can't do that, or I get called to Cosmic Karen's office.  She scolds me, then sends me back with more forms to sign, emails to send, and threats of being written up. I decided to not clock in or click out to see what happens. I got clocked out/in anyways no matter what.

“Good morning!” Major Tom announced.

“Have a good night!” Major Tom announced.

Over and over and over and over and over……

No one tells me the rules to follow; they just tell me to read the employee handbook. I flipped through the employee handbook which was in my drawer. From what I saw, the employee handbook just read, “rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, guidelines, guidelines, guidelines, etc.”

The words on pages finally change after the 10th page. The handbook started to say, “All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.”

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

Over and over and over and over again.

I stared at the pages with terror while the lights dimmed in the office. I looked up and saw Major Tom working normally. He doesn't care nor notice the light dimming.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

I kept reading the handbook as the lights started to flicker.

“Its always good to read the employee handbook,” the happy voice of Major Tom penetrates my ear drum.

I looked up and jumped back out of my seat and fell to the ground. Major Toms looked down at me with a crack to the sides of his fishbowl helmet. A bullet wound in his head that squirted blood. A pool of blood collects at the bottom of the fishbowl. Major Tom smiles with no worries in the world. I run through all the smiling Major Toms that aimlessly type on their keyboards. The light flickers overhead and the blood continuously pools in their helmets. The gunshot wound to the side of all of the Major Tom heads squirts blood.

“Hey, buddy,” they all say in unison as I sprint through them, “the weatherman predicts rainfall this afternoon. Don't forget an umbrella.”

“Oh fudge! I forgot my umbrella,” all Major Tom's said in unison. 

I finally made it to the bathroom and slammed the door shut. How long have I truly been in the office space? Where was I? What the hell is going on?

I texted my girlfriend:

Me: Baby! Is everything ok? I'm trying to escape.

Me: Can you send me a selfie!? A nude!?

Me: the office space never ends! The paperwork never STOPS! THE MODULES GO ON FOREVER!

Me: that dumb fishbowl headed fuck won't stop talking about the WEATHER! FUCK THE WEATHER!

Me: The only decent one is Mrs. Aza!

Me: why do they talk so much about the weather!? THERE IS NO WEATHER IN HERE!

Me: what do WE EVEN WORK ON!!!!????

Me: Blood is pooling in the fucking weirdo's helmet. How does he not notice?

I was left on read, so I waited, but nothing. I called her and her phone rang for a while. I called her again, but she still didn’t answer. I called another time, but nothing. I sat on the toilet as I desperately read the text messages and called her. I called her multiple times and she finally answered.

“Hey, baby, I am trying to escape,” I said, “I will be out.”

“I’m breaking up with you,” she suddenly yelped.

“What!? But…but I’m almost out!” I shouted into the phone.

“Yeah, well I talked to my girlfriend and my mom. They are right. You are a really toxic influence on me,” she muttered awkwardly to me, “I got clean. I’m seeing someone else.”

“What!? What the fuck!? Who’s this guy!”

“He’s an accountant and he’s really nice,” she replied, “we are finished.”

“Hahaha, I’d like to meet this guy!” I laughed like a maniac, “Once I get out! I’ll fucking find you!”

“Stay in your fucking office, asshole!” she screamed.

“I’m gett-” 

She hung up on me.

“Fuck! Shit! Ass!” I screamed as I threw my phone to the ground.

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

“Hey, anyone in there,” Major Tom said as he continued to knock, “I gotta drop the kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean.”

I started to scream like a madman as Major Tom knocked and told dad jokes. I started bashing my head against the wall as the knocking continued nonstop. My blood started trickling down my head and face, but the knocking didn’t stop.

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

“Anyone in there, I need to use the little boy's room,” Major Tom said.

I opened the door and there he was, his stupid ugly fishbowl, but this time, the blood pooled all the way to the top. The entire fishbowl on his head was full to the brim with blood, but he was talking normally to me a second ago. He shouldn’t be able to talk, instead he should be drowning in the blood. This place makes no sense!

“Hey, buddy, you ok? You are always in the bathroom. Do you have any gastrointestinal problems?” he asked, though his fishbowl was full of blood.

I angrily pushed him to the ground as I furiously ran to my desk. I passed countless Major Toms with blood pooled to the top of their fishbowl helmets as the lights flickered overhead. I was shaking intensely, my hands shook, my head hurt, and my nose was stuffy. I haven’t taken anything in months, so I sat there as I stared at the monitor. I saw millions of emails, so I started punching the screen, my fist was slashed by the glass of the monitor. I felt extreme pain in my hand as the blood dripped to the ground.

I looked up, I saw the paper pile, and I pushed it to the ground. The massive endless paper pile fell and collided with the Major Toms as it crashed to the ground. The office kept going and going, so the paper pile laid on the ground in the endless office. Papers covered the entire office, but the Major Toms didn’t care, all they did was smile and type their lives away. I looked through my drawers to find something to help me end this madness.

There were a pair of scissors laying at the bottom of the draw. 

I had the greatest idea; I am going to start stabbing Major Toms. I got up and scanned the ocean of Major Toms that kept going to infinity. Their helmets were a thick dark red with blood spilling to the ground from the cracked hole to the side. I blinked and all the Major Toms went back to normal. The lights overhead went from the flickering between dark and light to just bright. The brightness of the office always gave me a nasty headache.

“Hey, don’t run with scissors,” Major Tom casually said as he walked over to my desk.

I rushed him to get a headstart on my stabbing spree. I started stabbing him repeatedly in the abdomen and chest. He fell to the ground with a dumb smile plastered to his face. I stabbed another one as he typed on his computer and he fell face first into his keyboard. At this point, my suit was stained with blood from the one I hate the most. 

I stabbed another Major Tom who poured coffee into his dumb tube that he drank from. I stabbed him right in the heart. Then, I stabbed another in the heart, and I continued to run throughout the infinity office. I stabbed and stabbed more and more Major Toms. Now, I was drenched with blood, I shanked another Major Tom repeatedly.

“Hahahahahaha!” I started laughing as stabbed yet another one, “Fuck you! I hate all your jokes!”

I looked back and saw a bunch of dead Major Toms scattered through the office. I felt proud of myself at that moment, but there were more, a lot more. There was an ocean of them right in front of me. One Major Tom got up and walked towards me casually.

“Why the long face?” he casually asked as he got up from his desk.

“You are gonna need a laundromat to clean your suit,” another Major Tom said as he looked towards me from his cubicle, “got a guy, his name is Major Tom.”

“Oh, yeah, Major Tom is really great with tough stains,” another Major Tom answered.

I dropped the scissors and started screaming as I lunged towards the Major Tom that stood in front of me. I started punching his fishbowl repeatedly, but my knuckles started to hurt immensely. My knuckles probably broke at that moment as I continued to punch. The injury is called a boxers fracture which is a common fracture with MMA fighters and boxers. My fist went through the fishbowl and the glass sliced through my fist. 

My fist connected to his face and it was so satisfying. My wrist started to bleed heavily as the blood poured out of my open vein from the shards of glass. My wrist was sliced open by the glass. I started to lose consciousness from the blood loss, but I continued to pummel him with the broken sliced hand. I eventually passed out as I fell over on top of him.

“Yeah, it was a super busy day, it can be tough when you’re new,” Major Tom said underneath me, “I’m tired too, maybe we need a cup of sloppy joe.”

“You are right Major Tom!” Major Tom exclaimed, “I’ll brew some coffee.”

I faded away into unconsciousness as I heard Major Toms talk about coffee, the weather, the job, and sports. I woke up in a seat in front of Cosmic Karen’s desk as she types on her computer. The room was bright white that seemed to blind anybody that walked in and impossibly clean. My suit was back to being cleaner than a whistle as though the blood never existed. My face was in pain, a lot of pain, due to a constant smile that forced upon it. 

I assumed that while I was unconscious; my face had a forced plastered on plastic smile. My upper back was starting to hurt as though I sat straight up for several hours. While I was asleep, I was propped up in this seat for hours and hours. My hands were on my lap and there were no wounds. My wrists and hands were perfectly fine. My upper back and face hurt more than my hands. Cosmic Karen turned her head to face me as she uncrossed her legs. Her face was angry and sour as she glared straight at me with her ethereal blue eye focused upon me.

“Mr. Thomas,” she hissed with a thousand voices, “your little stunt earlier backed up our schedule. We now have to work overtime and through lunch. The creator is not too happy with that. Not only that, but he had to step in to file some paperwork, do an inspection, and help us clean up. You know how much he hates paperwork.”

“I apologize, Mrs. Karen,” I replied with a painful grin, “I will make sure it never happens again.”

“I’m sorry, but we had to escalate it and you have been written up yet again. Your type has always been a problem. Never wants to work honestly, always breaks the rules, and always has an attitude,” Cosmic Karen lectured, “I have had many of you come in and your type is always a nuisance.”

“Excuse me, Ma’am, but if you dislike my work so much, then why hire me?” I asked with forced politeness.

“Because there was a complaint and you needed to be corrected. Earthly correction doesn’t work with men like you,” she replied in a serious tone with a straight face, “sometimes you need to be introduced to something more.”

“Mrs. Karen, I… fu…freaking….h…a...hate it here,” I struggled to utter, “I’m not meant to be here.”

“Actually, you are meant to be here,” she replied while cocking her head to the side, “one more time you get into trouble. We will have to how dare I say it, let you go.”

“Yes, Mrs. Karen, but I want to be let go, I want to quit,” I said as I gritted my teeth through the smile.

“You want to quit? Hahahahaha,” she started laughing hard and cocked her head back to face the ceiling, “No, you don’t want to quit, you’ll end up in the unemployment zone.”

“Yes, I do Mrs. Kkkarren, I cannot stand it anymore,” I muttered, “please let me go.”

My eye started to twitch violently from the lack of sleep and my head was now starting to hurt real bad. I felt like some bashed my head repeatedly against the wall. My eyes were also strained from the constant white bright lights. There is a form of torture called the white room where they throw you in solitary confinement in white room. 

The entire room is white, the bed, the sink, even the food, and the drinks are white. This form of psychological torture is meant to induce headaches and extreme sensory deprivation. The entire office has bright lights and whiteness that covers everything. The only color is the suits that we wore, but we all wore the same suits. I wore the same-colored suit as Major Toms which was a grey suit. 

Mrs. Karen wore a grey pantsuit as she got up from her desk and walked to the other side of the desk. She played with my hair and started to pull it which jarred my head back. I couldn’t move out of the position that I was in as she poked my face with her long chrome nails that drew blood. She was close to me as she poked me and played with my hair. She stood directly over me and looked down on me with a large grin. 

The blue pulsating eye in the middle of her forehead was reading me like a book. I got to see the ever shifting blue eyes that phased in and out of her sickly white skin. I had an up close, personal view of her, and all her features including her rings that never stop spinning. I should’ve been repulsed, but I was infatuated with her as the beautiful angel that she was. At that moment, I realized that a demon would’ve been better. This woman was beyond any monster or demon, she was an Ophanim.

“You want to be let go? There is no fun in that!” she admitted with a menacing smile, “I like playing with cute boys like you because what breaks men like you is fascinating. The mundane, the normal, and having your freedoms taken away is what breaks you. Men like you are obsessed with power. It’s fun to take that away.”

“Yes! Ma’am!” I exclaimed with a cramping tensed up jaw, “I cannot take it anymore.”

“You can’t quit because this is not a normal job. I mean, you can, but that’s a bad idea,” she responded as she sat behind her glass desk, “I know that you want more. You want to kill me and Major Tom. That’s all you do. That's what you are good at. You can’t just quit. You need revenge.”

“Excuse me, Mrs. Karen, may I ask a question?” I asked as I slowly struggled to raise my shaking arms.

“Yes.”

“Who made the complaint?” I said as my entire body cramped up as I tried to move it.

“You are not authorized to know that” she replied with a straight face, “all I have to say is, your little game of life and death upset the one who made the complaint. He doesn’t like the unnecessary paperwork that death brings.”

“Th…th…the cr…eator,” I muttered as my head shook furiously.

I forced my cramping body to move as I leaped over her desk to strangle her. I managed to get on top of her and wrapped my fingers around her throat. I squeezed as hard as I could, so I could snuff her life out, and she struggled against me. My weight and strength overpowered her as she clawed at me with her chrome nails. 

The cold white skin of her throat was under my grasp. I held on like I was hanging from a cliff, but then, she snapped her finger. The golden rings above started spinning much faster. I started to light on fire, I felt my skin melt from the heat, but I never let go. I was the victor in that moment and I started to laugh through the intense heat.

“Hahaha, I will win! You biiii….tttt……chchch! I’m sorry Mrs. Karen! It won’t happen again, Ma’am!” I screamed as I choked her.

Finally, she went limp and she stopped breathing as her head fell back. The golden rings fell to the ground, but the blue eyes continued to shift on her skin. The fire disappeared and my body was back to normal. I was the victor! I was the winner!

“Yes! Yes! I win! I defeated that wench! I will go back to the-”

Suddenly, I was interrupted and thrusted back into the seat with a smile. My back straight and my hands on my lap. My suit had no wrinkles, my face was clean shaven, and my eyes stared straight at her. She stared at me with an angry snarl, the blue eye on her forehead glared at me with intensity, and she cocked her head to the side.

“Had fun? I’m gonna have to write you up a third time for your little outburst,” she said after a long tense silence.

“Mrs. Karen, do you enjoy this?” I asked in a gleeful way, “My suffering.”

“Yes, I do, I love breaking the minds of men like you,” she sternly answered.

“May I ask why?”

“Because men like you deserve to have your lives taken away, but in a different way,” she responded, “I can’t just kill you, though you deserve it. The creator forbids that, so I have come up with spaces that perfectly break the mind.”

“Men...men… li…ke…me,” I stuttered.

“Yes, sinners, sinners that play with death. A former hitman forced into an office space and is forced to work a gruelling unforgiving job. I find that funny,” she hissed with hatred, “Major Tom does all the paperwork, answers the email, and runs errands for the creator. You took a job to kill him like all the others. All the others had to spend time here like you.”

I sat there with the burning pain of the forced grin on my face. I couldn’t move no matter how hard I tried. I had no choice, but to listen to her, I wasn’t even allowed to talk at that moment.

“Your life, your freedom, and your power has been stripped from you,” she lectured, “Anyways, I dislike that I have to do this, but I have to…”

She took a deep breath as she moaned and sighed before she started to talk again.

“I’m gonna have to let you go.”

I opened my eyes, and I was in my bed in my house. I heard the birds chirping outside, I checked the time, and it was 9 AM. I jumped out of my bed and saw I was back in my assassins gear. I started to dance and jump around in joy.

“I’m free! I’m free!” I cried out as I started to dance.

I frantically called my girlfriend to tell her the good news, and she answered.

“I’m free from the office!” I cried into the phone.

“I’m done with you! You're asshole!” she screamed into the phone and hung up.

She was gonna come back to me, we’ve had a lot of fights, and she always comes back. I wanted to run outside and finally get some fresh air. I ran to the front door, turned the knob, and pushed it forward.

Pitch black, I opened the door and it was pitch black. I walked outside, there was a pitch black ground, but there was nothing. I walked outside for a few minutes and saw only darkness. I walked back to my house, closed the door, and locked it. I looked out the window to make sure and there was an endless sea of blackness. 

I sat on the couch and started to cry, so this is what Mrs. Karen meant by unemployment zone. I opened my laptop and started to look for a job on various job searching websites. I had a criminal record, so looking for employment is going to be hard. Luckily, there were jobs in other dimensions, universes, and realities. There were literally infinite job listings on the websites. As I waited for interviews and call backs; I decided to write this story to you guys.

It took me a few years and many awkward interviews. I had an interview with a jellyfish, grey men in suits, men in black, a starfish, a sea sponge, a crab that didn’t want to pay minimum wage, etc. I also had many normal interviews, but they didn’t like my background. So, I ended up being a cashier at this fast food place in dimension 5150. All of my customers have been ghosts, no literally, they are all ghosts. They look like stereotypical ghosts like they have white bed sheets on their heads and googly eyes. My coworker, Major Tom, always greets me before the shift.

Advice/support is appreciated.","Hi, 45f here, I've been following this subreddit for the past month and it's been really informative.  I think I have gastritis (though my bad GI's endoscopic diagnosis just says ""stomach inflammation"".) And it's been getting worse since the endoscopic biopsy.

A little background - chronic constipation here, IBS diagnosis for 20 years, basically managed by eating a high-fiber diet and the occasional laxative.  Dx'd with laryngesophageal reflux and a hiatal hernia from an endoscopy after waking up choking on acid too many times 7 years ago.  I never had any heartburn, stomach pain or indigestion though. I was able to cut out acidic fruits and vegetables but continue on omeprazole 20 mg for the past 7 years. It worked and I very rarely had acid choking incidents.  (For context, normally I would drink a couple beers or glasses of wine maybe every other week, I like ice cream for dessert, and I drink a large coffee every morning. I also eat and like a lot of raw fruits and vegetables because it helps the constipation, I eat a lot of salmon and chicken, I eat fried foods on occasion, and very occasionally a burger or red meat.)

Around March I realized I couldn't go to the bathroom. At all. I didn't even have the urge to, for two weeks straight. Normally it's not weird for me to go once a week. But this time nothing was happening with laxatives. I also noticed that when I had a glass of red wine my stomach would burn. So I cut out red wine.  The burning pain continued and I got more and more bloated. The stomach pain spread to my back and down my left side. I had no right-sided pain, and no chest pain.

First, I went to my PCP's NP and explained the situation, knowing I needed a GI doc.  Despite the horrific pre-prep experience 20 years prior, I was willing to go through it again to get a colonoscopy and figure out what was going on. He was new, asked me three times about my coffee consumption, asked me why I didn't take 40 mg of omeprazole (because the label doesn't say to?) and poked my stomach a couple times, before I said please just give me a referral.  he gave me a referral list of 10 docs.  They all had waitlists of 6 months to get seen. I started calling around off the list and finally found someone who could see me within the month, albeit in his after-hours ""clinic"" in June. He saw me for all of 10 minutes, dismissed all of my symptoms, told me everyone has a hiatal hernia. told me everyone has acid reflux, even told me ""everybody has polyps"". He didn't even examine me.  He took me to the receptionist to schedule an endoscopy (which I had to ask him to do, and he said he'd ""throw it in there"" after the colonoscopy), and a colonoscopy - and put me on a FIVE DAY bowel prep.  During this time I had to drink unholy quantities of magnesium citrate which hurt my teeth, made my muscles twitch and I think inflamed my stomach even more. Nothing in my colon, but the endoscopy comes back with a lot of fundic polyps with only a few of them removed for biopsies.  Negative for h. pylori, negative for Barretts esophagus, negative for dysplasia/cancer.  But I DO have:

""gastric antral mucosa with vascular conjunction and reactive changes""

""squamocolumnar junction mucosa with chronic inflammation""

""gastric body/fundic type mucosa with focal gland dilitation and fovealar hypoplastic changes""

When I called the doc to have him explain the results to me, all he would say through his receptionist was ""all samples benign"". That's it.  And a hiatal hernia, which I already told him about.  No hernia measurement, no diagnosis of anything else, no followup recommendations.

So of course I googled all of these things myself, which seems to be doing a lot of the healthcare heavy lifting these days, and everything came back as gastritis.

Since that endoscopy in July, everything in my stomach seems to have gotten WORSE. I figured a week to recover from the cuts of multiple biopsy retrievals was probably normal for healing, but the burning stomach pain, and just confusion about what to eat has continued and gotten worse and spread to my chest and to my back. I feel like I can actually FEEL the hernia now, mid-chest, worse than before the endoscopy.  One month post-endoscopy, my teeth still hurt, and I can taste acid in my mouth and throat ALL THE TIME.  It seems like the acid has completely taken over. I've cut out alcohol, I've learned that I have to taper off caffeine b/c going cold turkey after 20 years creates withdrawal symptoms, and I'm pretty much eating bananas, watermelon, oatmeal, Goldfish crackers, peanut butter sandwiches, and chicken and rice or chicken noodle soup for dinner. I had one relapse a couple weekends ago when I went to the beach on vacation and like a dummy gave in to a craving for a lobster roll, a couple beers, and a chocolate ice cream. And I paid for it with a week of pain.

After reading here about the pros and cons of PPIs I thought maybe the NP is right, I'll double up on esomeprazole. So I started taking 40 mgs in the morning instead of 20 It doesn't seem to be working, and a Pepcid before bed. Nothing I take will make the pain and burning go away.  When my stomach is empty, it hurts. When my stomach is full, it is too full, burns, and I'm also bloated.  I can't eat half a sandwich without feeling overly full. And I've never been an overeater. On top of that, I have to use enemas to go to the bathroom, because the last time I took something orally it set off my stomach all over again. I don't know how one manages this AND IBS simultaneously. It seems impossible. I'm not sleeping well.  Anxiety has also been added to the mix. I wake up with anxiety and heart palpitations now and I can't figure out why, considering that I actually take anti-anxiety meds before bed for this exact purpose.

The OTHER thing that's happening - I'm an avid hiker, (or used to be, before this situation took away all my energy) and I booked a walking holiday in Ireland for 10 days in August.  Back when this started happening in March, I really didn't think I would still be dealing with this in August.  And I figured that all the walking we're doing will help. If I can just stick to a bland Irish diet of fish and potatoes and try and smuggle some energy bars or snacks in my luggage, and ALL the meds - TSA will be blown away - I can get by my ""6 small bland meals"" diet.

But another thing I've started noticing - toward the end of my walks now, I get a wave of dizziness. I also got a wave of dizziness while I was driving home the other night, which was scary.  And I was on a 6 mile easy low-elevation hike last weekend when it seemed like my vision started getting blurry toward the end of my hike and the trees were coming in and out of focus.

I am also taking a B12 now, based on the advice given in this thread, but I know it takes a while to work.

I'm afraid of going on this trip with this new condition. I don't know if these new symptoms are side effects from the higher dose of esomeprazole and if I should go back to 20 mg. or if I have a B12 deficiency? I am just afraid of not keeping up on this trip and accidentally eating something that creates another flare.  I have an annual PCP exam the week after I get back and I plan to ask my doctor for more tests and an ultrasound to rule out gallbladder and pancreas issues, and blood tests for B12 deficiency, etc.  But there's a chance, again, I might not get seen for 6 more months.

(by the way, I live in the healthcare capital of the country - Boston. When I asked why the 6 month wait in this particular hospital system - again, one of the best in the world, I was told ""not enough doctors"".   welcome to America - the best trained doctors with absolutely no appointments available).

Since I'm new to what I think I've self-diagnosed as gastritis, I'm wondering if you guys have any tips for managing it while traveling abroad, and any tips for managing the anxiety of it, or ways to cope with the pain and discomfort?  Some people (my mother) have told me ""don't go"" in case there really is something more serious going on (all my vitals - BP, heart rate, cardiac levels are all normal so I'm not worried about that) but I resolved at the beginning of the year that if the future was going to be sh-tty I was going to get to Ireland if it was the one thing I did this year.  I can't cancel and I've already invested so much time and money into it.  I just keep telling myself, the walking will help, the walking will help, the walking will help.. but I am anxious as hell about it.",3,1754882185.0,Gastritis,5,1.0,False

1mn273m,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mn273m/feel_completely_stuck_in_my_job_search_after_a/,Feel completely stuck in my job search after a year- what to do?,"Hi everyone,

I made this account just to get some thoughts/advice because I feel completely stuck and don’t know what else to try.

I’ve been job searching for over a year now with zero interviews in the past few months, and it’s really getting to me. I’m exhausted, anxious, and feeling like there’s no way out.

A bit about me: BA in Marketing, working since I was 16: coffee shops, personal assistant/ nanny, admin, catering, customer support, etc. Did a marketing internship for a startup (wasn’t great), and for the last 5+ years I’ve worked in admin role. I also have a PMP certificate, but my project experience is mostly small-scale and low-budget

Current job situation:

**I hate my job:** Pay is low, no growth. Everyone has either quit or been fired, so I’m basically doing the job of 3 people. ’m included in every email thread imaginable, wasting my time and draining my energy.

Honestly, I feel like I’m just kept around because no one else is willing to do this much work for this little pay. I think if I asked to talk about workload, I’m 99% sure they’d just say something like “maybe this role isn’t the right fit” (as if I haven’t been trying to leave).

Also, I’m expected to plan large events on ridiculously small budgets like organizing a full-day event for 200 people at some fancy high end place with like 20k. It’s not realistic, it’s stressful.

Job hunt goals: Ideally NYC, but open to other U.S. cities. Event Manager / Event Marketing Manage or Project Coordinator / Junior Project Manager. To be very frank I wouldn't mind if my title is Dog walker as long as I make over 100k and have health insurance.

Salary goal: $100k–$150k, full-time, with benefits (401k, health insurance, etc.)

Job search so far using LinkedIn (even tried Premium — didn’t help), and Indeed. I also tried cold messaging and warm intros on LinkedIn but nothing ever comes of it. My friends can’t really help as most of them are digital nomads or in totally different fields

I’ve visited networking events, but most of the time it's just other job seekers equally desperate and not people who can hire. Also, I’m shy, not great at interviews, and really struggle with selling myself which is probably my biggest issue.

At this point, I just feel trapped. The job market is awful, but it feels like I must be doing something wrong if I can’t even land interviews anymore.

If anyone has been in a similar spot and found a way out, I’d really love to hear how.

Hybristophilia is a paraphilia, a sexual interest, in which an individual is attracted to people who have committed crimes or are otherwise considered dangerous or criminal.  This was real at the time, and still is.  Ramirez had groupies in court that were bat shit crazy in love with him, sent him love letters, etc, and the same went for Ted Bundy.  There was even one woman fan, that actually married Ramirez, at the prison (not  a joke.)   She was naive, claimed she saw nothing but good in him.   Then one day, she divorced him, and all the groupies & love letters stopped.  What did it take to finally break them of this hideous spell?  It was the cold case DNA confirmation, that Ramirez's first victim was in fact (brace yourself) ... an 8 year old girl, he raped and strangled to death.

Now the point I'm trying to make here is, is what the reaction would be, if the Epstein files got released (fingers crossed),   Even IF they were to reveal video evidence, anything, you name it, showing Baby Carrot raping an underage girl, the Quartering, Geeks & Gamers, and the rest of the expendable Trump simps, would STILL declare their undying love, for Taco.  I *bet* you that would happen, because that is what evil sick fucks that Hambly, and Griggs are, and that adds more reasons why they need to be de-platformed forever.

# best Glass Tray 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

The ubiquitous glass tray, frequently enough overlooked, plays a surprisingly vital role in modern homes and events. From serving appetizers and drinks too organizing countertops and showcasing decorative items, its versatility is unmatched. Selecting the right glass tray in 2025 involves considering factors like material quality, design aesthetics, durability, and functionality. this guide provides a detailed overview of the top glass trays available, helping you make an informed purchase that meets your specific needs. we explore a range of options, from elegant serving platters to practical organizers, ensuring you find the perfect glass tray to complement your lifestyle and enhance your home.

## Key Features analysis

The latest glass trays boast a range of improvements over previous models, focusing on enhanced durability, innovative designs, and versatile applications.

**Tempered Glass Construction:**

High-end glass trays utilize tempered glass, which is substantially stronger and more resistant to breakage than standard glass. This process involves heating the glass to a high temperature and then rapidly cooling it, creating a surface that is four to five times more durable. Tempered glass also shatters into small, relatively harmless pieces, reducing the risk of injury. This ensures the tray can withstand the rigors of daily use, even with heavy items or accidental bumps.

**Ergonomic Handles & Edges:**

Many modern glass trays feature ergonomically designed handles or raised edges for easy and safe handling.The handles are often made of durable materials like stainless steel or acrylic, providing a comfortable grip and preventing slippage. Raised edges prevent items from sliding off the tray during transport, ensuring that food, drinks, or decorative objects remain secure. These design elements enhance both the usability and the safety of the tray.

**Scratch-Resistant Coating:**

To maintain their pristine appearance, several glass tray manufacturers apply a scratch-resistant coating. This coating protects the surface from scratches and abrasions caused by daily use and cleaning. The coating is typically made of a obvious, durable polymer that does not affect the clarity or appearance of the glass. This feature ensures that the tray retains its beauty and functionality for years to come, even with frequent use.**Versatile Size and Shape Options:**

Glass trays are available in a wide variety of sizes and shapes to suit different needs and preferences. Options range from small, rectangular trays perfect for serving appetizers to large, round platters ideal for displaying cakes or desserts. Square, oval, and even uniquely shaped trays are also available, catering to diverse aesthetic tastes and functional requirements. These diverse options ensure that you can find the perfect glass tray for any occasion or purpose.

**Integrated Non-Slip Feet:**

To prevent the tray from sliding on smooth surfaces, many models incorporate integrated non-slip feet. These feet are typically made of silicone or rubber and are attached to the bottom of the tray. They provide a stable base,preventing the tray from moving or tipping over,especially when carrying heavy items. This feature enhances safety and prevents accidental spills or damage to surfaces.

**Heat Resistance :**

Modern glass trays designed for serving hot items are often made of borosilicate glass known for its high heat resistance. This type of glass can withstand temperatures up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) without cracking or shattering. This makes the tray ideal for serving dishes directly from the oven.

## Core Benefits

glass trays offer several key benefits that make them a valuable addition to any home.

**Elegant Presentation:** A glass tray elevates the presentation of food, drinks, or decorative items, adding a touch of sophistication to any setting. The transparent nature of the glass allows the contents to be the center of attention, while the clean lines and contemporary design create a visually appealing display. Whether you're serving cocktails at a party or displaying candles on a coffee table, a glass tray enhances the overall aesthetic.

**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:** Glass trays are incredibly easy to clean and maintain, requiring minimal effort to keep them looking their best. The smooth, non-porous surface of the glass prevents stains and odors from penetrating, making it simple to wipe clean with a damp cloth or sponge. Many glass trays are also dishwasher-safe, providing added convenience for busy individuals.

**Versatile Use:** Glass trays are incredibly versatile and can be used for a wide range of purposes, from serving food and drinks to organizing countertops and displaying decorative items. They can be used in the kitchen, dining room, living room, or even the bathroom, adding functionality and style to any space. This versatility makes them a smart investment for any home.

**durability and Longevity:** High-quality glass trays made from tempered glass or borosilicate glass are designed to be durable and long-lasting,providing years of reliable service. They can withstand the rigors of daily use, including heavy items, accidental bumps, and frequent cleaning. This durability ensures that the tray remains a valuable asset for years to come.

**Hygienic Surface:** The non-porous surface of glass makes it a hygienic material for serving food and drinks. it does not harbor bacteria or germs, making it a safe and sanitary option for any occasion. This is notably important for serving food to guests, as it helps to prevent the spread of illness.

## FAQs Section

**Are glass trays safe for serving hot foods?**
Yes, glass trays made of tempered or borosilicate glass are generally safe for serving hot foods. Borosilicate glass is specifically designed to withstand high temperatures without shattering. always check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure the tray is suitable for the intended use.

**how do I prevent scratches on my glass tray?**
To prevent scratches on your glass tray, avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads. Instead, use a mild dish soap and a soft cloth or sponge to clean the surface. A scratch-resistant coating also helps to protect the surface. Avoid placing sharp or rough objects directly on the tray without a protective barrier.

**Can I put a glass tray in the oven?**
No, unless the tray is specifically labeled as oven-safe. Not all glass trays are designed to withstand the high temperatures of an oven. Using a non-oven-safe glass tray in the oven can cause it to shatter, posing a safety risk.Check the manufacturer's instructions before placing a glass tray in the oven.

**What is the best way to store a glass tray?**
The best way to store a glass tray is to stack it carefully with other trays or place it on a shelf where it will not be bumped or scratched. You can use a soft cloth or piece of cardboard between trays to prevent scratching.avoid storing heavy items on top of the glass tray, as this could cause it to crack or break.## Competitor Comparison

1mn23i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mn23i2/am_i_the_ahole_for_cutting_my_sister_off_after/,Am I the ahole for cutting my sister off after her Wedding?,"I (F31) apologize, I'm autistic and dyslexic. 

Hi lovely queen potato charlotte, I want to start this off with when you read this, either the event has happened or it is going to happen, seeing as September is when this event is supposedly supposed to go down.

So, my sister is getting married this year. Her and her fiancé, both older, in their early 30’s (let's call them Fifi and Bruno.) They have been together for 13 years and now finally decided that this year they were going to get married. The day that they picked was on our father and his sisters birthday. Fifi is what we all like to call a control freak. She made EVERYTHING about her, on vacations she had to do everything with little to no time to rest. Family events she had to one up everyone, even going as far as to downplay my achievements. If I did well in something, she would say it was handed to me (which was not the case). My sister has been my third parent, my whole life. My bully. No one could compare to her. When she did something wrong, she would blame me instead. I thought when we got older, a lot of our childhood traumas and behaviours would disappear, but she hasn’t changed. I tried my best. I gave 100%, and my sister gave 10 (on good days). I still held out hope. When my sister started planning her wedding, she told me I could invite a friend which I thought was nice... on that note: about a year ago, I met my loving and adoring golden retriever boyfriend (Barry). Barry (M28) is a sweet, loveable,” everything I could ask for” type of boyfriend. He makes me the happiest I've been in years, which makes the actions of my sister more apparent, more obvious than ever before.



On to what we are all here for… at this point I am only a few weeks away from my sister's wedding as I write this. Many things have happened between then, but things that have really upset me are about my dress, and the fact I'm curvy and short, and that she wants me to show up a few hours before the actual ceremony, even though I'm not a part of the bridal party at all (that request feels suspicious to me). I am an alt girl, a thick curvy woman in black. Months ago when Fifi gave the invitation to me, I showed her pictures of my dress (pictures will be below) and got the okay from Fifi herself. She said that as long as it's “jewel tone colours” and as long as I'm comfortable, she was good with it. So, I bought the dress, and it was good to go! 

A few months after getting the almighty thumbs up from Fifi, she messaged me out of the blue (Which for her is normal. Months not hearing from Fifi is a wonderful thing believe me.) She started with the normal “The trees are green, The sky is blue, How are you?” Bs, but then she went in on the dress. She said that wearing black to the wedding means I'm in mourning for her relationship, and that the slit in the dress would mean I would look slutty (paraphrasing) (Strike one). I was not shocked, but I let her continue. She suggested I wear red. I told her if she’s going in on traditional colour palettes for weddings, then red means that you are “boinking” the husband (guess how fast she backed off of that idea lol) 

She then suggested 2 of the most awful colours possible imo: mustard yellow or bubblegum pink. Pink is not my colour (sorry) and mustard yellow would wash out my pale vampire skin. Even my boyfriend said the choices were bad, because he knows I don’t go well with pink, and said even most men wouldn’t want their cars to be “mustard” yellow. Anyways, I turned her down on both of those, since I had already purchased the dress and she already gave me the OK. I reassured her that it wouldn't be straight black, as there would also be another color underneath: A beautiful maroon skirt since I don't like showing my legs and the slit in the dress is high, like really high. It is still keeping with my dark side and her theme but also having some colour to it. Remember, this is all happening in September, so there would be no time to change out anything. Me and her went back and forth, and finally she gave up… or so I thought. 

Now, keep in mind I am not super skinny. By any means, I am very curvy. My sister came back a few weeks later and said “you have to lose at least a hundred pounds to 2 hundred pounds before the wedding, because I don’t want people to think you’re pregnant” (Strike 2). I told her it was rude to ask and also impossible given how close we are to the date. And no, I love the way I am and don’t feel the need to change myself to that degree. Not to mention that Fifi had begun to send her bridesmaids after me like bloodhounds to guilt me into doing what she wanted on both issues (one of them whom we’ll call Mimzy was so drunk the only words that were spelt properly were the cuss words). I told my boyfriend Barry, and he started looking for a Walking Dead special bat for this occasion. I told him I appreciate him so much for this, my god of thunder boyfriend, but that this was my fight, and him doing anything could make it worse. 

The final strike happened a few weeks later when on my day off, blissfully asleep at 5 in the morning, I awoke to my ringing phone. It was Fifi… calling me so early, the birds weren’t even up (Shocker.) She didn't even ask how I was or anything… she started yelling: “You haven't rsvp'd yet!” Looking at the time and due to the fact my brain struggled to see why this couldn’t wait until the sun was up and I’ve had coffee, I answered her with “Hmm?” … she did not like this. She screamed “you need to rsvp, you and Barry are coming to my wedding, right?!” I sat up and told her nothing came in the mail for me to rsvp. She screamed (probably waking her neighborhood up) “it's on the website I made!” Yes, she made a flipping website for this. Confused, I open the message and scroll to the link she had sent me a month ago. I opened it (while she's still screeching at me about the rsvp still at 5 in the morning) and I found her rsvp section and filled it out. I then asked her if she got it. She checked, and like night and day her whole demeanor changed. Like a girl scout who sold her last box of cookies for the day, she gleefully confirmed, and then finally hung up. I sadly didn't go back to sleep that day (Thank you Fifizilla.) 

Can you see how much Fifi has become the biggest atomic bridezilla? Still, I don't want to start fights with her. I want to keep the peace, at least until her wedding. After her wedding, I am to (as per instructed by my therapist), cut her off from any contact. I wish to do more than this (the topic of losing my shit at the wedding and trying to embarrass her has come up), but I won’t because like Jedi Jesus, I seek the high ground.

It breaks my heart to do this to her, because she is my sister, my blood. I thought that me and her could at least coexist in each other's worlds as siblings. If not friends, at least civilly. But, over the past few years, Fifi has only shown me how much I'm no longer even included in her world or ever was, and how my existence causes her embarrassment.

So I ask, to all of you: am I the a hole for cutting my sister out of my life after her wedding?

\---

Small update: so Fifi called me the other day. She did the normal bs.then went at me “have you started your weight loss program I told you to do?” I said no. She went at me “your gonna ruin my wedding or people with think you're pregnant!” she repeated again, crocodile tears heard through the phone. I clapped back “you know, the bay is having a sale on mannequins. I'm sure with that mindset you can get a whole bridal party for cheap.” The line went dead very quickly.

Update 2: a week later, a new player has reentered the mix. It’s Mimzy (the drunk one from earlier). No, I have never spoken to Mimzy before any of this, but she's part of the bridal party. She texted me (sober this time): “you need to stop ruining your sister's wedding!!!” I replied, tongue firmly in cheek: “Who's wedding?” “FIFIS WEDDING!!!!!!” she said. “oh what am I doing wrong?” I said. She responded “You're not losing weight and wearing a different dress!” I confirmed to her I am not. I said I am a guest and what I wear should not matter, because I'm not a part of the “Fifi bridal club for drunks” (I didn’t say it like that… but it was tempting). Mimzy did not like this and said that I was a horrible sister and why should I even attend my sister's wedding? I said, because I'm the sister of the bride. I'm family and it's the right thing to do. And if her toddler IQ can't handle that, too bad. I then deleted the text messages and blocked the number. The fact that Fifi is getting her bridesmaids to keep at this so close to the wedding is ridiculous and pathetic, tbh. As if they don’t have a full wedding to plan. May update if anything else happens.

According to the Global Sleep Study (2023) led by Dr. Rebecca Moore at Stanford University, optimizing sleep can boost productivity by 34%, improve decision-making by 29%, and even enhance emotional resilience by 40%. Here’s how to turn sleep into your ultimate performance enhancer.

https://preview.redd.it/zsrug9dt3bif1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d35580f162f1f9c4b9a296ab28c78ba76ff7c6e



1. Master Your Circadian Rhythm

Your body thrives on consistency. Research from the Chronobiology Institute (2022), directed by Dr. Ethan Lee, found that people who wake up and sleep at the same time every day (even on weekends) experience deeper, more restorative sleep. Try this:

\- Set a fixed wake-up time (e.g., 6:00 AM)

\- Avoid bright lights 90 minutes before bed

\- Get morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking



2. The 90-Minute Sleep Cycle Hack

Sleep occurs in 90-minute cycles. A study in Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021) by Dr. Sophia Chen showed that waking at the end of a cycle (after 6, 7.5, or 9 hours) reduces grogginess by 50%. Use apps like Sleep Cycle or set alarms in 90-minute increments (e.g., 6 or 7.5 hours after bedtime).



3. The Military Power Nap

NASA’s Fatigue Countermeasures Study (2020), led by Dr. Alan Pierce, proved that a 26-minute nap improves alertness by 54% and performance by 34%. Follow this elite napping protocol:

\- Limit naps to 20-30 minutes (prevents sleep inertia)

\- Nap between 1:00–3:00 PM (aligns with natural energy dip)

\- Drink coffee right before napping (caffeine kicks in upon waking)



4. Optimize Your Sleep Environment

The Sleep Environment Project (2023) by Dr. Hannah Park found that small tweaks can enhance sleep quality by 62%:

\- Keep your room at 65°F (18°C)

\- Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask

\- Eliminate noise with earplugs or white noise



5. The 10-3-2-1-0 Wind-Down Rule

Developed by sleep expert Dr. Michael Breus, this method primes your body for deep sleep:

\- 10 hours before bed: No more caffeine

\- 3 hours before: Stop eating heavy meals

\- 2 hours before: End work-related tasks

\- 1 hour before: Avoid screens (try reading instead)

\- 0: Hit the pillow with a clear mind



6. Leverage Sleep for Learning

A groundbreaking Harvard Study (2022) by Dr. Olivia Stern showed that reviewing key information before bed improves memory retention by 48%. Spend 15 minutes pre-sleep:

\- Review notes for an upcoming presentation

\- Listen to an educational podcast

\- Visualize your goals



7. Track and Optimize

Wearables like the Oura Ring or Whoop Strap (validated in the Biotech Sleep Study \[2023\]) provide personalized insights:

\- Deep sleep vs. REM balance

\- Resting heart rate trends

\- Recovery scores



Final Thought: Sleep Like a Champion

Sleep isn’t downtime—it’s upgrade time. As entrepreneur and biohacker David Sinclair (featured in the Longevity Sleep Study \[2023\]) says: ""The best performance hack isn’t a drug or supplement. It’s 8 hours of high-quality sleep."" Start with one hack tonight, and wake up closer to your peak potential.

1mn1zsu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn1zsu,Mini Cachapas,"Cachapa is a traditional Venezuelan dish. It's like a pancake or thin cake, made with ground sweet yellow corn. A touch of salt and a little sugar are added, although the latter is optional. It's very cheap, easy to make, delicious, filling, and very nutritious. You can also make several and refrigerate them for later. They're very versatile; you can pair them with black or brown beans. They also go well with sautéed vegetables, or you can eat them alone, accompanied by black coffee. If you sauté them the next day, they're even tastier. In short, they're truly delicious. Below, I'm sharing the recipe for some small cachapas I made some time ago on an electric griddle.



# THE RECIPE



**Time, ingredients and equipment**



* Preparation time: This recipe is really simple and quick if you already have the ground corn dough. If you do not have the possibility of acquiring freshly ground sweet corn dough (jojoto) in your area, you can buy a dozen ears of young corn, shell it and grind it, either with a food processor, a blender (you must grind it in portions very small so as not to damage the equipment), or in a hand mill. The mixing and preparation time for small cachapas will not exceed 30 minutes.
* Servings: From this amount of ingredients I obtained 7 units (cachapas), 13 cm in diameter on average.
* 500 grams of young corn dough (jojoto), fresh. **It is very important that it is yellow corn, with white corn the flavor does not go well.**
* 20 grams of or a heaping tablespoon of sugar, (this is the part that is different from the original recipe). The ideal would be to add cane sugar (piloncillo), but my family refuses this combination.
* 3 grams or half a teaspoon of salt.
* 250 ml of water.
* Large bowl for kneading, wooden or metal spoon (it doesn't matter), measuring cups (I used my traditional totuma ""dishes""), plates, spatula, and in this case I used an electric griddle, but they can be made in griddles or pans of any kind, even in a wide cauldron.

  
**THE PROCEDURE** 



To speed up the preparation of any recipe, we must have our ingredients measured and the utensils available to work. Where I live, it is an agricultural and livestock area, so it is feasible to get sweet corn, so it is common to sell this dough already ground in street stalls, or in some grocery store. The first thing we will do is pour the sweet corn dough into a large container to be able to mix it comfortably. As you can see, this dough has a very compact consistency, not fluid, which tells me that it was processed from corn that was no longer tender; which is why it will require more liquid to get it to a manageable consistency, so I add about 250 ml of room temperature water.

  
Then I add the salt and sugar, trying to ensure that they are very well distributed in the dough. I check the consistency, which should be not too runny, but not too dry either (everyone has their own criteria in this regard).

  
The next step is to preheat the griddle to 300ºF, for about five minutes, and then, once it is hot, form the discs of dough on the cooking surface. As this griddle is non-stick, it was not necessary to oil it, in case it is not, it is necessary to cover the area with a layer of cooking oil.

  
I will be very frank, I felt uncomfortable using this griddle, (perhaps lack of practice), so the discs were not round as I do them in a pan or in another special griddle that I have (budare). The minicachapas in this opportunity were left with irregular shapes; however, the flavor was quite good. I cooked each of these little pieces for about 3-4 minutes per side; however, if the cachapa is larger and thicker, it will require more time. You will know that you can turn the piece, when it begins to change the color on the surface, when it dries.

  
I can say that the experience using the electric iron was so-so, so I will have to use it more often to get familiar with it. The mini cachapas that I prepared had excellent flavor, in fact, I ate these together with my husband later, accompanied by a cup of coffee; but they are very versatile, they can be combined with beans, avocado, salads, with whatever you like or eaten alone, as I did.

Built a dream, she was telling me it’s time to propose and I’m perfect and she’s lucky to have me and doesn’t feel good enough but is so excited to be married. Didn’t really have much a family but had really taken to mine and just the same week she said thanks for being her true family that’s all she ever wanted to have. Best friends also my family. 

Now drops off the map, but end of summer we had to move 3 times. Weren’t sleeping, 14 hour shifts. Did an all nighter to move cross country and never been more tired in my life. One day to sleep and I noticed the next day she’d just gone blank. Like we’d always been super talkative and she wanted to talk to me or be with me 24/7 and like silence. Then right onto 3 days of 14 hour shifts and really only seeing each other before bed. I tell her on day 4 she’s acting like she doesn’t love me and why are we even doing our dream of traveling the world together if you don’t, I could just leave if you don’t like me. And she’d also started getting very sick, so total overwhelm, and she just said no your right it clicked that’s not fair and kept saying she felt nothing towards me. Not no love, but nothing. Although our connection was deep and there. She said must have been friendship. 

So I left. She was back in our home state 30 days later and got to talk. I asked her to coffee after a month apart and she’d ghosted, but she said for 10 minutes and stayed 3 hours. Cried about losing my family, said she’s sorry. I told her she’s a classic tearful avoidant and she agreed. She asked if she wants to be friends or drop altogether. I told her I love our connection and will be friends but I think she’s wrong, I think she’s just in some sort of protective detachment and I’ve done the work to better myself. She said she’d do some thinking. But it’s too soon to even be friends and needs more time apart. She comes back in another month.

2 weeks after the talk took me out of her insta bio as her partner of 7 years. But she seemed receptive to this is a result of her trauma and commitment issues. 

If I invite her to another discussion do you think even if she understands the psychology as she’s very smart and pretty emotionally attuned, or do you think she’d be able to re-access those emotions if I start from ground up and show her nervous system I’m safe?

The girl is literally cutting off all her friends, family, and partner just short of getting married and she was so excited for it.

1mn1vgs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn1vgs,The Backwards Budget: Why Forecasting Revenue First is Setting You Up to Fail,"As a small business owner, you wear a lot of hats. You’re the CEO, the head of marketing, the lead salesperson, and often, the chief coffee-maker. But the most critical hat you wear is that of the Chief Financial Officer. The financial health of your business rests squarely on your shoulders, and the primary tool for managing that health is your budget.

For years, the standard advice has been the same: start your budget by forecasting revenue. Project how much money you think you’ll make, and then decide how you'll spend it. It seems logical, right? Optimistic, even. You set a big, hairy, audacious goal for your revenue and build a plan to get there.

I’m here to tell you that this conventional wisdom is, for most small businesses, fundamentally flawed. I call it the ""Backwards Budget,"" and it’s a quiet saboteur, setting you up for cash flow crises, stressful decision-making, and ultimately, failure.

This isn't just a theoretical critique. I've seen the fallout firsthand in my work with hundreds of entrepreneurs. I’ve seen businesses with fantastic products and passionate founders crumble because their financial foundation was built on a house of cards—a revenue forecast that was more wishful thinking than reality.

In this article, we’re going to dismantle the ""Backwards Budget."" We'll explore why this revenue-first approach is so dangerous and introduce a more powerful, resilient, and realistic alternative. We’ll dive deep into practical **budgeting strategies**, with a special focus on a game-changing technique called **zero-based budgeting**. By the end, you’ll have a new framework for financial planning—one that gives you control, clarity, and a real path to sustainable profitability.

# The Great Disconnect: Why Revenue-First Budgeting Doesn't Work

Imagine you’re planning a cross-country road trip. The traditional budgeting method is like deciding you want to average 80 miles per hour for the entire trip *before* you’ve even looked at a map. You haven’t accounted for mountain passes, city traffic, construction zones, or how many times your kids will need a bathroom break. You’ve started with an optimistic outcome instead of the operational reality.

Forecasting revenue first does the same thing to your business. It creates a dangerous disconnect between your goals and the actual costs of running your company.

Here’s why it’s so problematic:

**1. It’s Built on Hope, Not Reality:** Revenue forecasts, especially for small businesses or startups, are educated guesses at best. You can analyze market trends, look at your sales pipeline, and build the most sophisticated spreadsheet model in the world, but you cannot predict the future. A key client might leave, a new competitor could emerge, or a global pandemic could change everything overnight.

When your entire spending plan is based on hitting a revenue target that is inherently uncertain, you’re on shaky ground. What happens when you’re in Month 4 and you’ve only hit 60% of your forecasted revenue? The budget you so carefully built becomes useless. You start making reactive, panicked decisions—slashing costs without a strategy, delaying critical investments, or worse, taking on high-interest debt to cover the shortfall.

**Example:** *Meet Sarah, a graphic designer who started her own agency. For her first year, she forecasted $150,000 in revenue. Based on this, she signed a lease for a trendy downtown office for $2,500 a month, hired a part-time assistant for $1,500 a month, and subscribed to a suite of premium software for $500 a month. Her fixed costs were $4,500 a month before she even paid herself. The first quarter was slow, and she only brought in $20,000. Suddenly, her ""plan"" was causing massive stress. The office felt like a gilded cage, and she was burning through her savings just to keep the lights on.*

**2. It Encourages Lifestyle Creep for Your Business:** The revenue-first approach often leads to a phenomenon I call ""business lifestyle creep."" It’s based on the idea of, ""If we make X, we can afford to spend Y."" This mindset encourages you to increase spending in direct proportion to your revenue projections.

You project a 20% increase in sales, so you feel justified in hiring another employee, moving to a bigger office, or investing in that flashy marketing campaign. But you haven't first determined if those expenses are the most efficient and effective use of capital. You're spending money you *hope* to have, not money you *actually* have. This is how businesses end up ""cash-flow rich but profit poor."" They have impressive revenue numbers but are constantly scrambling to pay their bills because their expense structure has ballooned.

**3. It Masks Inefficiencies:** When you start with a big revenue number, it’s easy to get lazy with your expenses. A $500 monthly software subscription doesn't seem like much when you're planning to make $50,000 a month. But what if you only use 10% of that software's features? What if a competitor offers a better tool for half the price?

The ""Backwards Budget"" doesn't force you to ask these tough questions. It doesn't demand justification for every dollar spent. It implicitly accepts last year's expenses as a baseline and builds upon them, allowing inefficiencies to become baked into your company's financial DNA.

# The Paradigm Shift: Lead with Expenses, Not Revenue

So, if starting with revenue is the wrong move, what’s the right one?

**You flip the model on its head. You start with your expenses.**

Instead of asking, ""How much money will we make and how can we spend it?"" you ask, ""What is the absolute minimum we need to spend to run this business effectively, and what revenue do we need to generate to support that?""

This approach forces you to become a master of your own operations. It grounds your financial plan in reality—in the tangible, knowable costs of doing business. Your budget becomes a tool for control and efficiency, not a document of hope.

The most powerful methodology for this expense-first approach is **zero-based budgeting (ZBB)**.

# The Ultimate Tool for Control: A Deep Dive into Zero-Based Budgeting

The name sounds intimidating, but the concept is beautifully simple. With zero-based budgeting, you start each new budgeting period (whether it’s a year, a quarter, or a month) from a ""zero base."" Every single expense, from your rent to the cost of paper clips, must be justified.

You don’t get to say, ""Well, we spent $5,000 on marketing last year, so let's budget $5,500 this year."" Instead, you must prove that the $5,000 (or any amount) is necessary and that it's the most effective use of those funds to achieve your goals.

ZBB is a proactive strategy. It turns you from a passive spender into a critical investor in your own company.

# How to Implement Zero-Based Budgeting: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Identify Your Core Business Objectives** Before you can justify an expense, you need to know what you're trying to achieve. Are you focused on acquiring new customers? Improving customer retention? Increasing operational efficiency? Launching a new product? Be specific. For this period, what are the 1-3 most important goals?

**Step 2: List Every Single Business Expense. Yes,** ***Every*** **Single One.** This is the most labor-intensive part, but it's also the most enlightening. Go through your bank statements, credit card bills, and accounting software for the last 6-12 months. Create a master list of everything you spend money on. Don’t judge or analyze yet—just capture the data.

Categorize them into two buckets:

* **Fixed Costs:** These are the expenses you have to pay regardless of your sales volume. Think rent, salaries, insurance, loan payments, and core software subscriptions.
* **Variable Costs:** These expenses fluctuate with your level of business activity. They include things like cost of goods sold (COGS), raw materials, shipping costs, sales commissions, and advertising spend.

**Step 3: Justify Every Line Item from Zero** Now, go through your list, line by line, and ask the tough questions. For each expense, you must defend its existence.

* **Is this expense absolutely essential to our operations?** (e.g., Rent, payroll, insurance). These are your ""cost of entry"" expenses.
* **Is this expense directly contributing to one of our core objectives?** If so, how? Can we measure the ROI? (e.g., Marketing campaigns, sales software).
* **Is there a cheaper, more efficient way to achieve the same result?** This is where you become a ruthless optimizer.
   * *Software:* ""We pay $300/month for this project management tool. Are we using all its features? Is there a $100/month alternative that does everything we actually need?""
   * *Supplies:* ""We order office supplies from a major retailer. Could we get a better price from a local supplier or a bulk-buying service?""
   * *Services:* ""We pay a retainer for an agency. Are they delivering value? Could we achieve better results with a specialized freelancer for a specific project?""

**Step 4: Build Your ""Survival"" Budget** From this analysis, you will build your baseline budget. This is the absolute leanest version of your business that can still operate and serve customers effectively. It includes all your essential fixed costs and the minimum variable costs required to deliver your product or service.

This number is your North Star. This is the *real* cost of running your business. Let’s call it your **""Break-Even Revenue Target.""** This is the first revenue goal you should care about. It's not about getting rich; it's about staying alive.

**Example Revisited:** \*Let's go back to Sarah, our graphic designer. If she had used ZBB, her process would have looked different. Instead of forecasting revenue, she would have asked, ""What do I absolutely need to start this agency?""

* **Essential Software:** Adobe Creative Suite ($60/month). Project management tool ($30/month). Accounting software ($30/month). Total: $120.
* **Office:** ""Do I need a downtown office, or can I work from home for the first year to keep overhead low?"" Decision: Work from home. Cost: $0.
* **Assistant:** ""Do I need an assistant now, or can I use automation tools and handle the admin myself until I have a steady client base?"" Decision: Handle it herself. Cost: $0. Her new ""Survival"" monthly cost is $120, not $4,500. Her Break-Even Revenue Target is a tiny fraction of what it was. The pressure is off. She can now focus on landing great clients, not just any client to cover her massive overhead.\*

# From Survival to Growth: Layering on the Strategy

Your ""Survival"" budget is your foundation. It’s not the end goal. The goal is to build a thriving, profitable business. Now that you have a stable base, you can start making strategic decisions about growth.

This is where you layer on ""Decision Packages."" These are discretionary expenses or investments that you believe will help you achieve your core objectives. You evaluate them as separate, optional packages.

**Examples of Decision Packages:**

* **Digital Marketing Campaign:**
   * *Objective:* Acquire 20 new customers.
   * *Cost:* $2,000 for Google Ads.
   * *Justification:* ""Based on industry benchmarks, we project this spend will generate 50 leads, and our conversion rate is 40%, leading to 20 new customers with a lifetime value of $500 each.""
* **Hiring a Salesperson:**
   * *Objective:* Increase sales outreach by 400%.
   * *Cost:* $4,000/month salary + commission.
   * *Justification:* ""A dedicated salesperson can make 100 calls a day, while I can only make 20. This will accelerate our pipeline growth and free me up to focus on closing deals and product development.""
* **Investing in New Equipment:**
   * *Objective:* Increase production efficiency by 30%.
   * *Cost:* $10,000 one-time.
   * *Justification:* ""This machine will reduce our per-unit production time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes, allowing us to increase output and lower our cost of goods sold, paying for itself in 18 months.""

You add these packages to your ""Survival"" budget one by one, based on their potential ROI and your available cash. This creates different tiers of your budget:

* **Budget Tier 1: Survival.** (Essential expenses only)
* **Budget Tier 2: Survival + Marketing Push.** (Adds the Google Ads package)
* **Budget Tier 3: Survival + Marketing + Sales Hire.** (Adds both packages)

# So, When Do We Think About Revenue?

Now. We think about revenue *now*.

With your tiered, expense-based budget in hand, your **forecasting methods** change completely. Your revenue forecast is no longer a hopeful starting point; it's a series of concrete goals tied directly to your operational plan.

* Your **Tier 1 Revenue Goal** is your Break-Even Target. This is non-negotiable.
* Your **Tier 2 Revenue Goal** is the break-even target *plus* the cost of the marketing campaign. This is your first growth goal.
* Your **Tier 3 Revenue Goal** is the break-even target plus the cost of marketing and the new salesperson. This is your aggressive growth goal.

See the difference? The conversation is no longer, ""We hope to make $250,000."" It's, ""To afford the business we want to build, which includes a new salesperson, we *must* generate $250,000 in revenue. Here is the step-by-step plan to get there.""

The revenue forecast is now an output of your strategic planning, not an input for your wishful thinking. It's a target you are actively working towards, backed by a clear, justified, and resilient spending plan.

# Conclusion: Build Your House on Bedrock, Not Sand

The ""Backwards Budget"" is tempting. It’s optimistic and focuses on the exciting part of the business—making money. But it’s an architecture of failure. It builds your financial house on the shifting sands of market uncertainty.

By flipping the model and embracing an expense-first approach like zero-based budgeting, you build your house on the bedrock of operational reality. You gain an unparalleled understanding of what it truly costs to run your business. You cultivate a culture of efficiency and accountability. Every dollar you spend has a purpose.

This isn't about thinking small. It's about thinking smart. It’s about building a lean, resilient, and powerful financial engine that can weather any storm and strategically fuel your growth.

Stop forecasting and start planning. Stop hoping and start controlling. Ditch the ""Backwards Budget"" and build a business that’s designed to last. Your future self—and your bank account—will thank you.

1mn1utv,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADj9Ma1OMJQ,12 Minutes - The “Consistency Cure” I learned from a 70-Year Old Paratrooper,"Kettlebell 12 - ​​[https://cart.chasingstrength.com/kettlebell-12](https://cart.chasingstrength.com/kettlebell-12)  
  
About ten years ago my friend and customer Dr. John Sullivan - then 70, former Army paratrooper and full-time chiropractor - was busy recovering from getting hit by a car (which should’ve killed him) - recapturing function from multiple broken bones…  
While seeing patients.  
He told me about how he was successfully using short, 12-minute workouts using Swings and Snatches on the back end of his strength work - 4 days a week.  
(Dr J later went on to earn his SFG2 Certification - becoming the oldest to do so.)

# How well did they work?

Dr J maintained single digit body fat and could climb a rope using only his hands holding an L-Sit.  
So that got me to thinking…  
If just 12 tiny minutes, four days a week, could re-build a 70-year-old busted up paratrooper, could they rebuild the Average Joe struggling with consistently working out?  
And what would happen if we kept the session micro but went to five weekdays in a row?  
Same 60-minute weekly time-cost - yet an extra rep of the habit loop every week to build workout consistency.  
But you might be wondering - is 12 minutes even worth it?

# Here are some “real world” payoffs:

1- Cardiovascular Health and Increased VO₂max - 12-min swings push HR ≈ 85 % HRmax & VO₂ ≈ 65 % VO₂max—same “vigorous” zone 30–45 min jogs hit (Farrar 2010).  
2- Strength + Power - Two 12-min bouts / wk × 6 wk → half-squat +10 %, vertical jump +20 % (Lake & Lauder 2012).  
3- Anabolic Hormone Boost (Testosterone and Growth Hormone) - Same block spikes GH & testosterone without frying cortisol (Budnar 2014).  
4- Calorie Furnace - Snatch intervals burn ≈ 13 kcal·min⁻¹ - on par with fast running, zero pavement pounding or knee pain (Porcari 2010).  
5- Recovery-Friendly - The dose is small enough to repeat tomorrow. Plus your joints and CNS stay happy.

# Sounds good, right?

But, as Ron Popeil used to say, “Wait, there’s more”...  
Here’s why 5 days a week is the “Consistency Cure”: (Check table on the video)  
Bottom line: Keep the workout tiny, repeat it almost daily, and the habit glues itself in place - results follow.  
Here’s How You Implement This - Your 10-Minute Action Plan  
Write one sentence that reminds you why this matters (e.g., “I train so I can play with my kids and not be exhausted after.”).  
Park your bell next to the coffee maker tonight.  
Tomorrow - every weekday - hit 12 minutes of swings/snatches when the brew finishes.  
Check a box on a wall calendar the instant the buzzer sounds. Watch the streak grow.  
If you need a program to help you get it done, I’ll leave a link to Kettlebell 12 in the video description below.  
It’s a 5 day-a-week plan I built as a result of my “Dr John Epiphany.”  
There’s a novice, intermediate, and advanced plan.  
**Remember:** Consistency isn’t luck - It’s tiny, repeatable wins. Let’s start yours in twelve minutes.  
Stay Strong,  
Geoff Neupert

It’s always a little adjustment being on vacation and my youngest (13yo son) is a high needs kid. He often acts rude and needs to be corrected which wears me out when I’m vacationing with him. (It wears everyone out!)
We had a good first few days at a seaside campsite. Camping is tough and my kids and I have all the right equipment to make it comfortable but it’s just a lot of work. I was feeling overwhelmed here and there, making coffee each morning, lunches before the beach, and generally tidying the campsite. I like that about camping and generally like to be fussing around the campsite but it’s still a lot and wears me out a bit, especially when I’m the only parent which is often the case. 

With no time to really recharge, my BF often lounged around reading, staring at his phone, and generally asks to be told (explicitly) when and how to help- exhausting, but ok. Even when I did give him direction, it came with some frustration and questioning on his part, which just added to my moodiness and exhaustion. 

I opened the door to discuss the tension each day when it seemed possible and we kept getting stuck in a communication spiral- him stating his issues and my reframing mine to try and help him understand. No real acknowledgment came from his side which made me very frustrated. 

By day 5, we both were pretty disconnected. As always, I suggested we work out the tension before starting to plan to the day- the communication issues just kept happening. He ended up slamming his hands in the table and getting really angry. He does this occasionally and I have shared that it doesn’t work for me, for him to get so aggressive and swear towards me- I hate it and it’s very triggering for a person who grew up around DV. 

He blurted out that he thought he needed to just leave. I felt that his saying that was a really important truth for him and expressed my sadness but if that is what he needed to do, it sounded like he had made up his mind. I left to take a walk but prepared my teens by saying he would be going home. 
Sure enough, within an hour, he arranged for a rental car and an uber to take him to the airport so he could drive home in the rental (6.5 hours away). 

I let him know that this was devastating to me and that I don’t feel our relationship would come back from this. I had all the gear, the kids, and now the rest of the travel to now navigate alone. I had never been left before and generally don’t have abandonment issues but this was so painful and new. I think it’s going to be something I need time to process and heal from.

His leaving tormented me the rest of trip and I just wanted to turn around and see him standing there. He never came back but every sound and around every corner, I longed for him to just show up. The pain was haunting me but I tried to stay focused on having a nice time for the kids. I had so much more work to do as a result and he left me with some additional expenses. 

I broke up with him the next day. I let him know that it all was very traumatic and created unnecessary drama for the kids and other people involved. He wrote me a message the next morning saying he had made a big mistake, but I don’t think it is going to work for me to go back to the table with him. He could have taken a day alone or made something else work but he chose to leave. Honestly, this isn’t the first time he has left at a time when I felt I needed support- that’s a big part of my feeling that breaking up is for the best. It’s been almost 3 years and we have a good relationship overall. I do find that I’m not as into the relationship anymore so it’s also an out for me or at least a chance to pause and reflect about what I want. Overall, he tends to be someone who doesn’t stick around and *literally* leaves me holding the bag emotionally.

In fact, how you start your day can set the tone for everything that follows. A 2023 study from the University of Nottingham (""The Impact of Morning Routines on Daily Productivity""), led by Dr. Emily Stone, found that people who dedicate just 10 intentional minutes to their morning routine experience 31% less stress and accomplish 40% more throughout the day.

1. The 2-Minute Mindset Reset

Before checking your phone, take two minutes to breathe deeply and set an intention. Research from Harvard Medical School (2022), conducted by Dr. Herbert Benson, showed that this simple practice lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) by 23% and increases focus.



Try this:

\- Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6.

\- Whisper one word to define your day (e.g., ""energy,"" ""calm"").



2. The 3-Minute ""Win List""

Instead of a overwhelming to-do list, write down three small wins you want to achieve by noon. A University of California study (2021), led by Dr. Robert Emmons, proved that this trick boosts motivation by 62%.



Example wins:

\- ""Reply to my most important email.""

\- ""Drink a full glass of water.""

\- ""Walk for 5 minutes.""



3. The 5-Minute ""Body Wake-Up""

Your body needs to move to shake off sleep inertia. A 2022 study in The Journal of Physiology, led by Dr. Kelly Starrett, found that five minutes of dynamic stretching increases alertness as effectively as a cup of coffee.



Quick routine:

\- Arm circles (1 min)

\- Toe touches (1 min)

\- Torso twists (1 min)

\- Jumping jacks (2 min)



4. The 10-Second Gratitude Boost

Gratitude isn’t just fluffy advice—it’s neuroscience. A University of Miami study (2023), directed by Dr. Michael McCullough, revealed that thinking of one thing you’re grateful for (even your pillow!) triggers dopamine, the ""feel-good"" chemical.



Pro tip: Pair this with brushing your teeth to build the habit.



5. The ""No-Screen"" First 10 Minutes

Resist the urge to scroll. A Stanford study (2021) by Dr. Anna Lembke found that delaying screen time for just 10 minutes after waking:

\- Reduces anxiety by 27%

\- Improves mental clarity



Swap scrolling for:

\- Sipping water

\- Looking out the window

\- Stretching



Why These Tricks Work

Your brain is most impressionable right after waking—a state called ""neuroplasticity priming."" A 2023 MIT study by Dr. John Gabrieli showed that habits formed in the first 10 minutes of the day are 5x more likely to stick.



Real-Life Success Stories

\- Fitness coach Jillian Michaels starts her day with 3 minutes of meditation (no excuses).

\- Author James Clear writes his ""win list"" while his coffee brews.

Make It Unmissable

Place reminders where you’ll see them:

\- A sticky note on your mirror: ""Breathe first.""

\- A water bottle by your bed.

\- Your phone in another room overnight.



Your Turn

You don’t need hours—just 10 intentional minutes. Try one trick tomorrow, then add another every few days. Within weeks, you’ll wake up feeling in control, energized, and ready to conquer your day.",1,1754880700.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

##‌ Key ⁣Features Analysis

The best black electric tea kettles boast a range of⁤ features designed to⁢ improve​ efficiency, safety,⁣ and overall user experience. These features differentiate models and contribute to their suitability for different needs and preferences.

**Rapid ⁣Boiling Technology:** Modern electric tea kettles utilize powerful heating elements to ⁣achieve rapid​ boiling times.

Rapid boiling technology is essential for busy individuals and families who need hot water quickly. Many kettles can boil⁤ water in as little as 3-5 minutes, a significant enhancement over traditional stovetop kettles. This technology often involves a concealed heating element, which not only speeds⁤ up the boiling process but also makes cleaning easier. It ‍ensures that water is heated evenly ⁣and efficiently, minimizing energy ‍waste.

**Precise Temperature Control:** Advanced models offer variable temperature settings, catering to different ⁤types of tea and beverages.

Precise⁣ temperature control is crucial for brewing the perfect cup of tea ‌or coffee. Different types of tea, such as green,⁣ black, or oolong, ⁢require specific water temperatures to extract their optimal flavour. Kettles with ⁢this feature allow users to ‌select the precise temperature needed, typically ranging from 170°F to 212°F. This ensures⁤ that​ delicate tea leaves are not ⁤scalded and⁣ that the full flavor profile is ⁤unlocked.

**Keep-Warm Function:** This feature maintains the desired water temperature for an extended period.

The keep-warm function is a convenient addition for those who enjoy multiple ​cups of tea or coffee throughout the day. It automatically maintains the selected water temperature ​for ​a specified duration, typically ranging from 30 minutes to an hour. ⁣This eliminates‌ the need to reboil water repeatedly, saving time and energy. The feature is particularly useful for entertaining guests or for individuals who prefer to keep hot water readily available.

**Automatic Shut-Off and ‌Boil-Dry Protection:** Safety features that prevent the kettle from overheating⁣ and operating without water.

Automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection are essential safety⁢ features in any electric tea kettle.⁣ automatic shut-off ensures​ that the kettle turns off ⁤automatically once the water reaches its boiling point,⁤ preventing overboiling⁤ and energy waste. Boil-dry protection prevents the kettle from operating when there is insufficient water, protecting⁣ the heating element from damage and reducing the risk of fire.These⁣ features provide peace ⁤of mind⁣ and‌ enhance the overall safety of the appliance.

**Durable construction Materials:** High-quality kettles are made from stainless steel or borosilicate glass for longevity and ⁢safety.Durable construction materials are critical for the ⁢longevity and safety of an electric ⁣tea‍ kettle. stainless steel is​ a popular choice for ⁤its durability, resistance to rust and corrosion, and its clean, modern appearance. Borosilicate ⁢glass is another excellent option, as it is heat-resistant and does ‍not impart any unwanted flavors or odors to the water. high-quality materials ensure that the kettle can withstand daily use ⁤and maintain its performance over⁣ time.

I’ve been trying to do more short getaways that feel chill and recharging without being boring and Santa Barbara was perfect for that. It’s walkable, cute, not overwhelming, and has that kind of slow-luxury vibe without needing to do much planning.

Here’s a quick idea of how I structured my 3 days as a solo woman. (I also made a mapped version with all the pins if you want to use it, linked below).

**Day 1:** I stayed at the Hotel Californian which was a little splurge but totally worth it. Right between the Funk Zone and the beach so I could just walk everywhere. I did a little sunset walk to Stearns Wharf, grabbed wine and fish tacos, and just kind of eased into the trip.

**Day 2:** Wine tour day Santa Ynez Valley. Honestly one of the prettiest drives I’ve ever done. It felt safe and relaxed doing it solo since it was a group tour. I came back super zen, grabbed a late lunch at Brophy Bros. by the harbor, and later treated myself to a massage at FLOAT Spa. 10/10 recommend.

**Day 3:** Woke up early and walked Butterfly Beach with coffee in hand, then had brunch at Boathouse (the views!!). Walked around downtown a bit more, stopped at La Arcada Plaza to poke around shops and galleries. I had a few hours to kill before heading out so I just chilled in the Mission Rose Garden with a book. It was the perfect slow sendoff.

A few random tips if you’re going solo:

* You honestly don’t need a car if you stay near downtown or the Funk Zone.
* The pace is slow in a good way. No pressure to over-schedule.
* It felt safe the whole time, even walking alone during sunset.
* Lots of chill moments built in spa time, beach, cafes with outdoor seating, wine tasting with new people if you want social energy without committing.

Anyway, I’ve been sharing a few of my solo getaways lately, past and future and I put them into little 3-day mapped guides. They’re kind of like a shortcut if you want to skip the planning part but still have a stylish, easy trip.

Here’s the one I made for Santa Barbara if anyone wants it:

1mn1lru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn1lru,Can you really “know” a cigar after only one?,"This afternoon, I finally busted out the Davidoff Late Hour Churchill. It seems this line has been mentioned a number of times today, but I digress. I’ve had five in my humidor for a few days more than two months (after spending an unknown amount of time at the tobacconist). I had purchased a single for $30 and a four pack for just over $100 *on sale*. I have read plenty of reviews on the Late Hour line; “Vastly different than regular Davidoffs” and “The best Davidoff period” and “You will be impressed” are but a few of the plaudits floating around about this line. 

I simply disagree.

As I’ve mentioned on numerous occasions in many threads here on this sub, I find Davidoff to be one of the most mediocre cigars – especially given their price point – available for purchase. My mindset with this cigar though was “I’ve both read and been told this line is different/better, so let’s give it a run.”

So, my humidor for just over two months, the tobacconist’s humidor for who knows how long, *and* I even dry boxed this cigar overnight. 

It had a great nose to me - bread from a toaster and baking spices (in particular, cinnamon and nutmeg). The cold draw was semi sweet cocoa. Really nice. 

After lighting, I got some really nice flavors of light black coffee and leather. Again, nice.

But then, it started to burn wonky, and it kept going out. When I did get it to stay lit, it honest to God reminded me of a fire cured cigar. There was a large vein running almost the length of the cigar. When I say “large,” I mean big enough for it to be noticed running under both cigar bands (see the photos). Entirely *not* what I’m looking for from a $25-$30 Davidoff not what should be expected from a cigar of this price point. I will say, however, I felt the smell was wonderful, not indicative of what I was actually trying to smoke. 

The second and final third gave me yet more burn problems, two more relights, and only a faint hint of the scotch barrel tobacco “aging” that Davidoff brags about with these. 

It wasn’t *all* bad. It *was* very earthy and a leather forward cigar and I really dig those flavors. It started off as a low, medium strength cigar but from the halfway point till I stop smoking, this was very full bodied. I enjoyed that.

My mindset even now though is that the very mediocre experience I had today with this cigar can be - *and is* - found in vastly cheaper cigars. Further, a *much better* experience IS found in much cheaper cigars; just go back a day or so, and read my review of the new Stolen Throne Castle 919. That cigar was $11 and IMO, straight blew this Davidoff off out of the water in every single facet.

*Is it fair to give high praise to a cigar I like after smoking just one while needing to smoke multiples of those I don’t just to see if I got a dud?* 

I’m surely in the minority here about this line - and probably about Davidoff in general, but that’s okay. I just now I have to figure out what to do with the four more Late Hour Churchill’s that are taking up space in my humidor…
