I had this happen recently at a local coffee shop I frequent - hasn't happened before w/ other baristas. Usually there's a few buttons to select a tip amount, or no tip, then write your signature for the transaction. The tip amount they selected was about 75% of the cost of the drink (nothing fancy). I noticed it before I signed and selected a different tip option. Maybe they just accidentally pushed the button, but idk. Anyone else have this experience?",1,1767702227.0,Seattle,1,1.0,False

1q5h5f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BimmerCode/comments/1q5h5f2/are_you_seeking_purpose_of_human_civilization/,are you seeking purpose of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1767702175.0,BimmerCode,1,0.33,False

**A cold and late seasonal greetings to all our dedicated searchers; and hoping you all have started off this year well! We welcome you all back to our (now) traditionally late but unending devoted thread to recaping the monthly solves, news and going-ons within the** ***Lostwave*** **community. We have had a full house of solves during December, and we hope you all enjoyed each one of them. But, just before you read on make sure you give the wonderful Yuri's** [**recap of November**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pmw57d/monthly_recap_thread_november_has_come_november/) **a check out too!**

 ***This recap was written by myself (south\_pole\_ball), with collaboration with Skyat and with the help of many users from our associated Discord server! Now onto the main attractions! (***[**Discord Link**](https://discord.gg/UWfZCsWW)***)***

# ==- December's Most Notable Solves -==

\- [**Vivisect - Agoraphobia (1985)**](https://youtu.be/SdKY7iSud_0) **'Better Off Dead'** ([Solve Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pfatzk/better_off_dead_solved/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  
***(USA, Punk-Metal / Doom-Metal, 1985)***  
 A fan favourite, previously to be believed, doom metal track that took December by storm by it's unexpected solve at the start of the month. After being advertised by *Discord* user **Centroid** to the 'samplespotters' *Facebook* group, group member **Timon Asteria** hurridly spent a couple hours looking at 'punk' releases from the 1985 in the *USA* on *Discogs*, until they fortunately found a match. 

\- [**95:Nil - Full Beam (1995)**](https://youtu.be/yox4BLjZj2w) **'Paranoid Brown'** ([Solve Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pwx4lc/paranoid_brown_is_solved_lets_gooooooo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  
***(UK, Neo-Psychedelia / Alt-Rock, 1995)***  
 Recorded from the French radio station—*Radio 666*, presumably at some point in 1990s by *WatZatSong?* user **CentralMuzik**. The original upload was an instrumental snippet with no further information, it wouldn't be for another 2 years, in 2023 that **CentralMuzik** returned and supplied the full song. And it would take close to another 3 years for *Discord* user **arin** to use YouTube's advanced search queries to find a similar sounding song called *S.G.L* by the band **Thule**, which had an almost identical 'melody and structure'. **Arin** had discovered that **Thule** had formed another band which had been named **94:Nil** and **96:Nil**, and additionally found a way to contact them. **Martin Byrne**, of all three bands, responded to **Arin**, stating that they were all the same band just renamed, and provided the correct identification as **95:Nil** \- *Full Beam****.***

\- [**Manish Shukla - Jingle Bells, This Is Hell (2023)**](https://youtu.be/ASQOuyu5FoI) **'Jingle Bells, This Is Hell'** ([Solve Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pkp01r/jingle_bells_this_is_hell_was_solved_as_manish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))  
***(USA, Festive-Pop / Parody, 2023)***  
 Originally discovered through *Fiverr*, by *Discord* user **arin** whilst attempting to find the source of another *Lostwave* song (*That's What I Like About You*) in 2024. The animation was known to have been comissioned by *Fiverr* user **mnshukla**. During December of 2025, *Discord* user **LiamLimeLarm** reversed image searched mnshukla's profile picture, finding both a Linkdin and Instagram account of a person named **Manish Shukla**. *Discord* user **Alan** successfully got a response by **Manish** which confirmed that he was responsible for the song and that he had created it in 2023.

\- [**Made Them Lions - All I Want For Christmas Is You (2014\~)**](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s_-hzyh4oqE) **'All I Want For Christmas Is You'**  
**(Canada, Festive-Pop, 2014\~)**  
Recorded from a French-Canadian radio in 2024 by *WerZatSong?* user **YuritheSpaceman**. The song is a dual cover of the famous **Mariah Carey** song '*All I Want for Christmas is You,*' featuring both English and French lyrics. After one year and featuring for less than a day as *Fond My Mind*'s Christmas special song, *Discord* user espalier identified the song through the use of *onlineradiobox.com.*

# ==- Lostwave Promotional Posts -==

\- [**'Whatever the Season**'](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1q06jk5/unidentified_artist_whatever_the_season_late_1980s/) by u/[Rich-Ad-9696](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rich-Ad-9696/)  
***(Unknown, Funk, 1980s\~)***  
 A funk track presumably from the 1980s originally posted by *WerZatSong?* user **Houston26**, who acquired the song itself from a *Dailymotion* video from 2008 by the user **V8SAFE**. Perhaps you know this catchy tune?

\- [**'What the Word'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1pvmc9y/unknown_hardcore_punk_music_that_played_at_the/) by u/Massive_Towel_7936  
***(Brazil, Hardcore Punk, 1995\~)***  
 A presumably rare Brazillian hardcore punk track that featured in the comedy / horror Brazillian film '*O Monstro Legume do Espaço*' (1995) directed by Petter Baiestorf. Maybe you can help identify this horrific mystery?

\- [**'The F-ing Egyptian'**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lostwave/comments/1put2im/mystery_christmas_song/) by u/ibathedaily  
**(USA, Carol, 1980s\~)**  
 A cute Christmas carol song recorded from a now forgotten radio channel from the USA in the 1980s. Half-way through we are abruptly interrupted by an unknown trucker lambasting insults at an another unknown Egyptian person. A new personal favourite Christmas unknown. 

# ==- Lostwave Deep-Cuts & Classics -==

This is a new section that will focus on bringing attention to older Lostwave tracks, be it unsolved or solved. Mostly to show a little love to forgotten mysteries or accomplishments.

\- [**'First Time Ever (Unknown Remix)'**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ssrAn1dwE) **(Unsolved)**  
***(UK, Trance / Techno, 1990s\~)***  
 Originally recorded from the *Colin Dale Show* that aired on *Kiss 100FM*, a former London based radio station. *YouTube* user **PandorasEmptyBox** states that when they first recorded, presumably in the 90s, it via a cassette they had unfortunately tapped over the host citing the artist and name. Perhaps you could shed some light on this old mystery!

\- [**Cinema35 - Tonight (1980s\~)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDvpzKYHWeQ) **'Branimir's Instrumental December 2020'**  
***(UK, Synthpop, 1980s\~)***  
 First appearing onto *YouTube* by fan favourite user **Barni** in 2020, the true origins were not located for another 5 years until *Discord* user **Mystic65** located it via WerZatSong. Now known to be originally posted within an 80s New Wave compilation by *YouTube* user **FarGo's Music** without a tracklist in 2014. This Synthpop track was identified by *Discord* user **RojoCatto** after locating it within a *Soundcloud* upload by user **MarcFord**.

\- [**Marc Liberman & Peter Paul - La Folie (1984)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJSjE_lcyXg) **'Julia Can Testify'**  
**(Austria, Disco / Funk, 1984)**  
 Recorded by *YouTube* user **Benny P.**'s father in 1984 onto a cassette which it remained unknown until being posted by **Benny P.** in 2018. A futher 5 years this song would have to wait until *Discord* user **Randolurker** would correctly identify this funk track.

# ==- Lostwave Discussion -==

# ==- Bodrick's Recommendations -==

**-**[ **Cults - Like I Do (2020)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lUgUt8aQ6k)  
A melodic but hard hitting alt-rock synth track, that has been on repeat for me recently.

**-** [**Nobukazu Takemura - Bright time to Come (1997)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXeBIecHjGk)  
Nobukazu transports you to a foreign world full of bright colours and wonder with this relatively obscure track from the late 90s Japan. A beautiful instrumental track that feels reminds you to hold onto the child like wonder of our artistic musical worlds.

[\- **M.O.T.O - Choking on your insides (From Ampeg Stud 1995) (2013)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF74bfmckQA)  
A violent blast from the late 90s, vibrating a message that is closely held true to many of us today unfortuantely.

**FAQ**

**What is Our Philly?**

It's an events calendar. Our event hosts — venues, clubs, whatever — use a range of platforms, newsletters, etc. to promote their events. We round them all up.

**How do I add my event?**

There's a button on the bottom of the site. If you're logged in, you can drop an event in the calendar in under a minute — quick, easy, free.

**Is it just weekends?**

Nope. The site is updated daily with 300-600 events per week. This Reddit post is a weekend preview — the full calendar is always at [ourphilly.org](https://ourphilly.org).",1,1767702053.0,philly,0,1.0,False
1q5h3xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/E34/comments/1q5h3xk/are_you_seeking_for_ultimate_knowledge/,are you seeking for ultimate knowledge,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1767702052.0,E34,0,1.0,False

1q5h04r,https://www.reddit.com/r/retrocars/comments/1q5h04r/are_you_seeking_for_purpose_of_life/,are you seeking for purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Do I need the latest version of the pi, or would that be overkill for an application like this? 

What battery/power supply would be best for that format? 

What are some quality retailers you would recommend for sourcing parts?

Would a Wi-Fi range extender be recommended if I wanted to use it at a library or coffee shop or something?

Guy tried to ""test drive it home"" because he forgot his license","I was at a dealership yesterday finishing paperwork on a car I’d already reserved, just sitting in that little waiting area with the sad coffee and the wall TV on mute. While I’m waiting, this guy comes in looking rushed, not screaming or anything, just in that tight jaw fast walking way. He goes up to the desk and says he’s here for a specific car and he has an email saying it was being held. The receptionist is polite and asks for his name and license, normal stuff. He pats his pockets and does that little panic laugh and goes, ""Okay so I left my wallet at home, but I’m literally buying today. Can we just do the test drive first and I’ll show you everything after?"" The receptionist says no, they need a physical license to let anyone drive. He stays calm but starts pushing, like ""I can pull up a photo of it, I have my insurance card on my phone, I can show you my credit app, come on."" A salesperson comes over and repeats the policy, and the guy keeps trying to negotiate around it. He says he drove in from almost an hour away, he took time off, he has his kid’s car seat in the back and he needs to see if it fits, and if they won’t let him take the car around the block then they’re ""kinda wasting his day."" It wasn’t full on rude, but he kept saying it like it should matter more than their rules. He even tried, ""What if I just take it to the gas station and back, you can keep my phone if you want."" The salesperson offers alternatives: they can bring the car around for him to sit in, measure stuff, try the car seat, but he can’t drive without a license. The guy does that sigh like they’re being petty and says, ""So you’re telling me you won’t let a serious buyer do a simple test drive bc of paperwork.""



That’s when the twist happened, and it got weirdly quiet. A woman walks in carrying a diaper bag, looks at him, and goes, ""Are you kidding me, you didnt bring your wallet again?"" He turns red immediately. She apologizes to the receptionist and pulls his wallet out of her bag like she’s done this before. Then she looks at him and says, not loud, but firm, ""You are not driving. Your license is suspended right now, remember? That’s why I’m the one driving us places."" The guy stares at the floor and mumbles something like ""It’s getting fixed"" and ""I just wanted to check it."" The manager, who had been hovering nearby, just nods and says they’d be happy to do a test drive with her as the driver and him as passenger, or they can reschedule when his situation is sorted. The woman thanks them for sticking to policy and asks to see the car anyway because she needs something safe for the baby. The guy went from ""I’m a serious buyer"" to this deflated quiet dude in like 10 seconds, and honestly it was the most real entitlement I’ve seen. Not cartoon villain stuff, just someone trying to bulldoze rules bc he didnt want to deal with the consequences in front of his own family.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1q5gqyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1q5gqyg/i_procrastinated_on_everything_important_for_6/,"I procrastinated on everything important for 6 years, here’s how I finally stopped","
I’m 27. For the last 6 years of my life, I procrastinated on literally everything that mattered.

Important work project due? I’d start it the night before in a panic. Doctor’s appointment I needed to schedule? Put it off for 8 months. Bills that needed paying? Waited until I got late notices. Difficult conversations I needed to have? Avoided them until the relationship fell apart.

I wasn’t lazy in the traditional sense. I was always doing something. I just wasn’t doing the things I actually needed to do.

Instead of working on important tasks, I’d reorganize my desk. Clean my room. Research the perfect productivity system. Watch videos about how to stop procrastinating. Do busy work that felt productive but accomplished nothing.

I was a master at looking busy while avoiding anything that actually mattered.

This destroyed my life in ways I didn’t even realize until recently. Lost job opportunities because I missed deadlines. Ruined relationships because I avoided difficult conversations. Stayed unhealthy because I procrastinated on doctor visits and eating right. Stayed broke because I put off working on my career.

Every single important area of my life suffered because I couldn’t make myself do hard things until they became emergencies.

THE PROCRASTINATION LIFE

It started in college. I’d have a paper due in 3 weeks. Plenty of time. I’d tell myself I’d start early this time, really plan it out, do it right.

Day 1, I’d think about the paper but not start it. Still had 3 weeks.

Week 1, I’d do some light research. Bookmark some articles I’d definitely read later. Feel productive.

Week 2, I’d outline the paper. Feel good about making progress. Then not touch it for another week.

Night before it was due, I’d panic and write the entire thing in 6 hours fueled by energy drinks and anxiety. Turn it in at 11:58pm. Get a B minus.

Every single time. I knew exactly how much time I had before panic mode kicked in and I’d use every second of it to avoid the work.

Graduated college and the pattern continued into real life except now the stakes were higher.

Got a job in project management. Good salary, decent company. I was smart enough to do the work well. But I’d procrastinate on everything until the last possible moment.

Had a presentation due Friday? I’d start making the slides Thursday night. Had to review a document by Monday? I’d do it Monday morning. Had a difficult email to send? I’d rewrite it 30 times and still not send it.

My boss noticed. Started missing me off important projects because he couldn’t trust me to deliver on time. That hurt but not enough to change.

Got let go after a year. They said it was downsizing but I knew it was my procrastination. They kept people who delivered consistently and cut people who were unreliable.

Next job, same thing. Smart enough to get hired, too much of a procrastinator to keep the job. Lasted 8 months.

After that I did freelance work because at least I couldn’t get fired. But I’d take on projects and procrastinate until clients got pissed. Lost clients constantly. Made barely enough to survive.

My personal life was the same disaster. Needed to go to the dentist, put it off for 3 years until I had a cavity that needed a root canal. Needed to have a serious talk with my girlfriend about our relationship, avoided it for months until she broke up with me. Needed to file my taxes, waited until the last day and then filed for an extension.

Everything important got pushed to tomorrow. Tomorrow became next week. Next week became next month. Next month became never or became a crisis.

I was 27 and had accomplished almost nothing because I spent 6 years avoiding everything that actually mattered.

WHY I PROCRASTINATED ON EVERYTHING

Used to think I was just bad at time management or needed better systems. Tried every productivity app and method. GTD, Pomodoro, time blocking, bullet journaling. Nothing worked.

Finally realized procrastination wasn’t about time management. It was about emotion management.

I procrastinated on important things because they made me uncomfortable. The bigger and more important the task, the more anxiety it caused, the more I avoided it.

Work project that mattered? Scary because I might fail or it might not be good enough. So I’d avoid it and do easy tasks instead.

Difficult conversation? Scary because of potential conflict or rejection. So I’d put it off until it exploded.

Doctor appointment? Scared they’d find something wrong. So I just didn’t go.

Job applications? Scared of rejection. So I’d research and prepare forever but never actually apply.

I was avoiding discomfort. My brain learned that procrastination provided short term relief from anxiety. Do something easy and feel good now, deal with consequences later.

The problem is later always comes. And when it does, the consequences are worse and the anxiety is worse and now I’m in crisis mode.

Also I had zero accountability. No one was checking on me. No external pressure until deadlines hit. So I’d drift along procrastinating because there were no consequences until it was too late.

My dopamine system was fucked too. Between social media, video games, and YouTube, I could get instant gratification any time I wanted. Working on something hard and important for unclear future payoff couldn’t compete with the easy dopamine hit of scrolling TikTok.

I’d built a life where avoiding important things was easy and doing important things was hard.

PREVIOUS FAILED ATTEMPTS TO STOP

Tried to fix this so many times over the years.

Attempt 1, made elaborate to do lists every day. Felt productive making the lists. Never actually did the important items. Just did the easy quick tasks so I could check boxes.

Attempt 2, used the Pomodoro technique. Worked for one day. Then I’d start a Pomodoro for an important task and spend the whole 25 minutes on Twitter instead.

Attempt 3, told myself I’d do the hardest thing first every day. Did that exactly once. Every other day I’d convince myself I needed to ease into the day with easier tasks first.

Attempt 4, tried habit stacking and morning routines. Built great routines around easy things like making coffee and working out. Still procrastinated on actual important work.

Attempt 5, hired an accountability coach. Told him I’d get things done. Then lied to him about my progress because I was too embarrassed to admit I’d procrastinated again.

Nothing worked because I was treating the symptoms instead of the root cause. I wasn’t building the ability to do uncomfortable things. I was just trying different ways to trick myself into being productive.

THE ACTUAL TURNING POINT

My dad came to visit. He’s 64, retired last year from a career he actually built. We were talking and he asked what I was working on.

Gave him some vague answer about freelance projects and figuring things out.

He said, you know when I was your age I procrastinated on everything too. Cost me my first marriage and almost cost me my career. Took me years to figure out that I was just scared.

That hit different. My dad never talked about his failures. And the idea that procrastination was about fear, not laziness or bad habits, made something click.

I wasn’t procrastinating because I was lazy or disorganized. I was procrastinating because I was scared of discomfort and failure and I’d never learned how to push through those feelings.

Started researching procrastination from that angle. Found this video from a guy who’d overcome chronic procrastination by building what he called discomfort tolerance. The ability to do hard things even when every part of you wants to avoid them.

He said you can’t think your way out of procrastination. You have to train yourself to act despite discomfort. And you need external structure because your brain will always find excuses.

He mentioned using an app called Reload that forces you to complete daily tasks and blocks escape routes during work hours. It builds the discipline to do uncomfortable things through progressive difficulty.

That made sense. Every time I’d tried to stop procrastinating before, I relied on motivation or willpower. Which worked until the task made me uncomfortable, then I’d find any excuse to avoid it.

Downloaded the app and set it up. Told it my main issue was procrastinating on important tasks. My goals were to stop procrastinating, build the ability to do hard things, complete important work on time, stop avoiding uncomfortable situations.

It generated a 60 day program that started with tasks that seemed almost too easy.

Week 1, do one important task within 5 minutes of thinking about it. Work on your most important project for just 15 minutes. Send one message or email you’ve been avoiding. That’s it.

The app also blocked my usual escape apps during work hours. No Twitter, no YouTube, no Reddit, no TikTok. Couldn’t procrastinate by scrolling when I was supposed to be working.

MONTH 1, LEARNING TO START

Week 1 to 2, the 5 minute rule changed everything. I’d think about doing something important and instead of adding it to my list for later, I had to start it within 5 minutes.

Didn’t have to finish it. Just had to start. That removed the pressure that usually made me procrastinate.

Needed to send a difficult email? Had to open my email and start writing within 5 minutes. Usually by the time I started I’d just finish it because starting was the hard part.

The 15 minutes of important work thing worked because it was manageable. I could do anything for 15 minutes. Couldn’t tell myself I needed a 4 hour block of perfect focus time.

My apps being blocked during work hours eliminated my escape routes. Usually when something felt uncomfortable I’d open Twitter or YouTube without even thinking. Now I couldn’t. Had to sit with the discomfort instead of avoiding it.

Week 3 to 4, tasks ramped up slightly. Do three important tasks within 5 minutes. Work on most important project for 30 minutes. Have one uncomfortable conversation you’ve been avoiding.

That conversation one was brutal. I’d been avoiding talking to a client about late payment for 2 months. Finally sent the message. Client apologized and paid immediately. I’d built up this huge anxiety about it and it took 5 minutes to resolve.

Started noticing a pattern. The things I procrastinated on the most took way less time and were way less painful than I’d built them up to be in my head. The anticipation was worse than the actual task.

MONTH 2, BUILDING MOMENTUM

Week 5 to 6, increased to 45 minutes on important work. Five important tasks done within 5 minutes of thinking about them. Two uncomfortable tasks per week.

Was actually getting things done for the first time in years. Not perfectly, not always on time, but way more consistently than before.

Applied for three jobs I’d been putting off. Got interviews for two. That never would’ve happened if I kept procrastinating.

Scheduled the doctor appointments I’d been avoiding for over a year. Dentist, physical, everything. Turned out I was fine, I’d just been anxious for no reason.

Had difficult conversations I’d been putting off. Some went well, some didn’t, but at least they were done instead of hanging over my head.

Week 7 to 8, hit my first real test. Had a big freelance project due in two weeks. Old me would’ve procrastinated until the last 2 days and done a shit job.

The app had me work on it for 90 minutes every day starting immediately. No waiting for the perfect time or the right mood. Just show up and work.

Did it. Finished the project 3 days early. Client was shocked. I was shocked. First time in 6 years I’d finished something important early instead of in a panic at the last second.

The ranked mode in the app kept me motivated. Seeing my consistency score go up made me want to keep the streak going. Gamified following through instead of procrastinating.

MONTH 3 TO 5, ACTUALLY CHANGING

Month 3, the tasks were legitimately challenging. Work on important projects for 2 hours daily. Complete all important tasks same day you identify them. Do one thing you’ve been procrastinating on for over a month.

That last one made me face things I’d been avoiding for way too long. Taxes I hadn’t filed. Friendships I’d let die because I avoided reaching out. Career moves I’d been too scared to make.

Started filing my overdue taxes. Reached out to old friends. Applied for jobs I actually wanted instead of just taking whatever was easy.

Month 4, got offered a job at a company I actually wanted to work for. Good salary, interesting work, growth potential. The kind of opportunity I would’ve fucked up in the past by procrastinating during the interview process.

This time I prepared early. Responded to emails promptly. Did the take home assignment immediately instead of waiting until the night before. Got the offer.

Month 5, started the new job. Old me would’ve procrastinated there too and gotten let go within a year. New me was completing work ahead of schedule. My manager actually commented on how reliable I was.

That felt surreal. Reliable. Me. The guy who’d been fired from two jobs for procrastinating.

WHERE I AM NOW

It’s been 7 months since I started actually addressing my procrastination instead of just feeling bad about it.

I still procrastinate sometimes. It’s not completely gone. But instead of procrastinating on everything important for weeks or months, I might put something off for a day before I make myself do it.

Got promoted at my job last month. Three months in and I got promoted because I was consistently delivering good work on time. That never would’ve happened before.

My personal life is better too. I handle things when they come up instead of letting them build into disasters. Schedule appointments when I need them. Have difficult conversations when they’re needed. Pay bills on time. File my taxes early.

Still use Reload daily because the structure keeps me from slipping back. The app blocking during work hours keeps me from escaping into social media. The daily tasks keep me doing important things instead of just easy things.

Most importantly, I can make myself do uncomfortable things now. That’s the real change. I’m not waiting for motivation or the perfect moment. I just do the thing even when I don’t want to.

My dad visited again last week. Asked how things were going. I actually had real accomplishments to tell him about instead of vague excuses. He said he could see the difference. That meant a lot.

WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT PROCRASTINATION

Procrastination isn’t about time management or productivity systems. It’s about avoiding emotional discomfort. You procrastinate on things that make you anxious or scared or uncomfortable.

You can’t think your way out of it. You have to build the ability to act despite discomfort. That’s a skill you develop through practice, not something you fix with the right app or method.

The anticipation is always worse than the actual task. The difficult email, the uncomfortable conversation, the important project. They’re never as bad as the anxiety you build up avoiding them.

Starting is the hardest part. Once you actually start the thing you’ve been procrastinating on, momentum carries you through. It’s the gap between thinking about it and starting that kills you.

You need external structure when your internal discipline is broken. You can’t rely on willpower or motivation to overcome years of procrastination habits. You need systems that force you to follow through.

Remove your escape routes. As long as you can easily scroll social media or watch YouTube when things get uncomfortable, you’ll choose that over doing hard things. Block the exits.

Small wins build momentum. One important task done on time leads to another. One uncomfortable conversation handled well makes the next one easier. The confidence compounds.

Procrastination is usually protecting you from something. Fear of failure, fear of judgment, fear of success, fear of discomfort. You have to figure out what you’re actually avoiding and face it directly.

You can’t wait until you feel like it. You’ll never feel like doing the hard uncomfortable important things. You do them anyway and the feelings follow.

IF YOU PROCRASTINATE LIKE I DID

Stop lying to yourself about why you procrastinate. It’s not because you work better under pressure or you’re waiting for the right time. You’re avoiding discomfort.

Identify the one thing you’ve been procrastinating on the longest. The thing that makes you most uncomfortable to think about. That’s what you need to do first.

Use the 5 minute rule. When you think about doing something important, start it within 5 minutes. Don’t add it to a list for later. Start now even if you don’t finish.

Block your escape apps during work hours. Remove the ability to avoid discomfort by scrolling. Make it harder to procrastinate than to just do the work.

Start with 15 minutes on the important thing. You can do anything for 15 minutes. Don’t wait for hours of perfect focus time. Just do 15 minutes now.

Build external accountability. An app, a person, a public commitment. Something outside yourself that creates pressure to follow through.

Do the uncomfortable thing first. The difficult email, the hard conversation, the scary task. Get it done early before you have time to build up anxiety about it.

Track what you complete, not what you plan to do. Your to do list doesn’t matter. What matters is what you actually finished today.

Accept that doing the thing will feel uncomfortable and do it anyway. You’re not waiting for it to feel easy. You’re building the ability to act despite discomfort.

Give yourself 60 days of actually following through before you judge if you can change. Not 3 days. Not 2 weeks. Two full months of doing hard things consistently.

I spent 6 years procrastinating on everything that mattered and it destroyed my career, my relationships, and my potential. I’m 7 months into actually doing uncomfortable things and my life is completely different.

Stop waiting for tomorrow. What’s the one important thing you’ve been procrastinating on that you could start right now?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1767700964.0,Discipline,1,1.0,False

I wasn't drinking a TON before, mainly just beer and 12 or so a week. It feels nice to be sharper during the day.

However, one thing I have noticed is how extremely groggy I am during the mornings. I always get up at 5 AM every single day and while drinking it was no big deal. I never had hangovers because I never drank that much. It was always a few beers before bed to help me sleep.

Now with sleeping I don't wake up throughout the night or anything like that. I sleep straight through but wake up so groggy. To the point where I have to have 2-3 cups of coffee and it takes me an hour to wake up fully. 

While drinking I was out at 5 AM walking the dog under the streetlights. Now it takes everything just to get up and going. 

I'm hoping this part will pass because I love everything else about not drinking.",3,1767700851.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

1q5gp6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PercyJacksonTV/comments/1q5gp6s/i_feel_let_down_by_the_series_i_want_to_love_it/,I feel let down by the series... I want to love it SO BAD!,"I'm sorry if this is another post stamping on the series, but as a fan – despite trying to find as many positives in it as I can – I just finding watching this series incredibly frustrating.

  
When it first started I really thought it had potential and I was – and to an extent, still am – excited to see the landscape and camp and settings come to life to see exactly how Camp Half Blood looks and feels. I wanted an authentic adaptation of the books and to see the awesome stories I'd loved before come to life. 

At the beginning, I was hopeful. I'd seen the major castings and was happy with a lot of them. I'd previously seen Walker in The Adam Project and thought he could definitely capture Percy like he is in the books. I liked a lot of the god castings too (even if they're very A-Listy and likely very expensive) and was very interested in giving Leah an opportunity to bring Annabeth alive even if she didn't necessarily look like the Annabeth I knew from the books.

When it first aired, I enjoyed the first episode (maybe two) and particularly liked the actress who played Sally Jackson, I think she's doing a really good job. There were a couple of small changes but I was expecting that and didn't mind. I felt the same hatred for Gabe, for example, which tells me that actor did a great job capturing a horrible character! But then, as the story unfolded it became less and less reliant on the source material I've found myself feeling betrayed by the series. Especially the completely different ending of TLT which lacked the consequences of the book.

I found Aunty M's particularly frustrating because in the books the trio were too naive – even Annabeth – and were 12 year olds guided by hunger, not by battle instinct which is completely believable. Because of this, they end up cornered by Medusa and have to think fast on their feet to escape. In the series, they arrive and after 2 seconds of tension Annabeth has worked out the whole thing, stated the obvious and given no suspense which makes the rest of the scene almost unnecessary.

Therefore I didn't necessarily have high hopes for season 2 and wasn't especially fussed since of all the books, this one is probably my least favourite. I don't dislike it, but I tend to skip over it to TTC because I really like that book. That said, to prepare for season 2 I re-read SoM. All I can say is BIG MISTAKE. 

When season 2 rolled around I suddenly realised I should have forgotten how the book went because then I probably wouldn't be quite so disappointed. It just seems like all the important character-defining moments have been lost. 

Straight away we find out that Tyson's a Cyclops. What?! This annoyed me so much because in the book Percy befriends Tyson because that's who he is, not because he feels he needs to because Tyson is from his world. Percy didn't know he was a Cyclops, just thought he was an odd kid and CHOSE to befriend him anyway. That's a key character distinction for me and one that foreshadows his fatal flaw of (essentially) caring too much about people – particularly his friends. Then, the dodgeball with cannibals (the event the entire episode is based on) was about 3 minutes long and outside camp which just felt odd. I DID like Tantalus though, the guy gives me the creeps which is exactly what should happen so kudos to that actor! Likewise, the actress who plays Clarisse (despite being far prettier than she's described in the books) is nailing Clarisse being both dislikable but also garnering sympathy – especially in the scenes on the boat! Having just watched the siren scene I'm really annoyed because, once again, a key moment of character development is lost. I've seen a couple of other people on here saying the same. In the book, Annabeth elects to hear the sirens as an opportunity to study herself and gain insight into her weaknesses as a demigod. It's a heart-wrenching moment as we confirm her feelings for Luke and come to understand that her fatal flaw is her hubris. The way this is snatched away for us in the series is sad. Annabeth just announces her fatal flaw like a coffee order and the sirens scene becomes more about special effects than building an emotional connection between the characters (and the audience). To me, this moment is a defining one for Percabeth and I didn't feel that here.

Basically, I just wanted to know how others felt about the changes they've made and the effects on their love of the books, the story and the series? If I'm honest, I certainly pin no blame on the actors, I think they're trying and I've grown on Leah's portrayal of Annabeth more than I thought I would. I like Grover's actor even if I don't think he's getting as much screen time as he needs to shine and I don't think Walker is the issue with Percy being a 2D character. Tbh, I think most of it seems to be more interest in building elaborate sets and hiring really famous God actors than spending the time pinpointing the crucial moments from the books – keeping those as close as possible – and then writing the rest of the narrative around it to make it fit into 8 episodes, make sense and (most importantly) capture the humourous but high-stakes and snarky-attitude of Percy Jackson.

I tried the **Retriever AI Chrome Extension**, and it blew me away.

This free browser automation tool doesn’t just answer questions like ChatGPT — it actually *does* the work for you.

You tell it what to do. It clicks, scrolls, extracts data, fills forms, and even sends emails — all automatically.

It’s like having a personal assistant living inside Chrome that never gets tired, never complains, and never misses a detail.



# What is Retriever AI Chrome Extension?

Retriever AI is a Chrome-based AI agent that lets you automate anything you’d normally do in your browser.

It’s designed to work inside Chrome, not in the cloud.

That means it runs fast, stays private, and can interact with pages in real-time — clicking buttons, scraping data, or writing emails.

Most browser automation tools are clunky, expensive, or easy to detect.

Retriever AI is none of those things.

It’s simple, stealthy, and shockingly effective.



# Setting Up Retriever AI Chrome Extension

Here’s what happened when I installed it.

I went to the Chrome Web Store, hit “Add to Chrome,” and within seconds the Retriever AI icon appeared.

No API keys, no complicated setup, no coding.

Then I typed my first command:

“Scrape the pricing from the AI Profit Boardroom website.”

It instantly opened the tab, navigated the site, scrolled, extracted data, and created a clean spreadsheet.

Zero human clicks after that.



# Testing Retriever AI Chrome Extension on LinkedIn

Next, I gave it a harder challenge.

“Find Julian Goldie (the SEO guy) on LinkedIn and scrape all the data from his profile.”

Retriever AI went to LinkedIn, searched my name, opened my profile, analyzed the page, and grabbed every detail.

Headline, experience, about section — everything.

Then it generated a personalized email pitch based on that data.

Subject line, message body, CTA — all done in one go.

That’s when I realized this thing wasn’t just smart — it was *useful*.

It understood context, extracted structured data, and acted on it instantly.



# Retriever AI Chrome Extension + Gmail = Game Over

Once it had the scraped data, I said:

“Send this email to [julian@gmail.com]() from my inbox.”

It opened Gmail, filled out the message, wrote the subject, pasted the content, and sent it.

I didn’t touch the keyboard.

That’s when I thought — this is the future of outreach.

You can find leads, write emails, and send them… automatically.



# Extracting Testimonials with Retriever AI Chrome Extension

Then I wanted to push it further.

I told it:

“Go to [julianoldie.com](http://julianoldie.com) and extract all testimonials into a spreadsheet.”

Retriever AI opened my site, scrolled, grabbed every client quote, and sorted them into neat columns inside Google Sheets — client name, source, testimonial text.

No scraping code. No Python scripts.

Just one prompt.

And yes — the testimonials were 100% accurate.

This is how I knew Retriever wasn’t just doing keyword matching — it was reading the page like a human would.



# Automating Competitor Research

Then I tried:

“Scrape all blog titles and publication dates from [goldieagency.com/blog.”](http://goldieagency.com/blog.”)

Retriever AI browsed the entire site, pulled all the post titles, and created another spreadsheet in seconds.

Perfectly formatted.

No manual copy-pasting.

No more endless scrolling.

Just pure, repeatable data collection.



# How Retriever AI Chrome Extension Works

Here’s the secret.

Retriever AI acts like a “micro brain” inside your browser.

It observes what you do and repeats it automatically.

You can teach it a sequence of clicks — like opening a classroom module, adding a new page, saving notes — and it remembers that workflow.

It calls this feature “Tricks.”

Once recorded, Retriever can run that Trick over and over again — building a full automation system inside your browser.

While the Tricks feature had some bugs, most other automations worked flawlessly.



# The Retriever AI Chrome Extension Workflow Framework

Here’s how I now use it daily:

* **Step 1:** Use Retriever to scrape competitor data and leads.
* **Step 2:** Let it generate emails directly in Gmail.
* **Step 3:** Export all leads into Google Sheets.
* **Step 4:** Run follow-ups on autopilot.

It’s like turning Chrome into your personal lead-generation system.

While you’re doing other tasks, Retriever quietly works in the background — gathering data, writing outreach messages, or updating spreadsheets.



If you want the templates and AI workflows, check out **Julian Goldie’s FREE AI Success Lab Community** here: [https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/](https://aisuccesslabjuliangoldie.com/)

Inside, you’ll see exactly how creators are using **Retriever AI Chrome Extension** to automate education, content creation, and client training — including frameworks for data scraping, outreach, and social proof extraction.



# Why Retriever AI Chrome Extension Beats Other Tools

Tools like Claude or ChatGPT can write text, but they can’t *act*.

Retriever can.

It physically moves your browser, clicks elements, fills forms, and fetches data.

Other automation tools like n8n or Zapier require setup and APIs.

Retriever doesn’t.

It just works.

That’s what makes it so game-changing.



# The Browser Automation Revolution

Think about it:

Before, you had to manually find leads, collect data, and build reports.

Now, Retriever AI Chrome Extension does it all while you focus on real work.

It’s like cloning your best VA — for free.

You can set up automations for:

* LinkedIn lead scraping
* Competitor monitoring
* Form submissions
* Data entry
* Google Sheets management
* Email follow-ups

You name it — Retriever can handle it.



# Inside the Retriever AI 30-Day Browser Domination Plan

I built a 30-day framework for using Retriever AI Chrome Extension effectively.

Each day, you set up one small automation.

By the end, your browser is running 90% of your manual workflows.

Day 1: Install Retriever and connect Google Drive.  
Day 5: Scrape your LinkedIn prospects.  
Day 10: Send personalized cold emails.  
Day 15: Extract testimonials for social proof.  
Day 20: Automate competitor tracking.  
Day 30: Run everything on repeat.

By then, your browser literally works for you.



# The Future of Retriever AI Chrome Extension

Retriever is still improving, but even now it’s ridiculously powerful.

It’s not perfect — the “Tricks” feature needs refinement — but for scraping, automation, and email workflows, it’s world-class.

And it’s free.

That’s what makes it so wild.

You don’t need coding skills, APIs, or complex setups.

You just tell it what to do.

And it does it.



# Retriever AI Chrome Extension vs. Old-School Manual Work

Old way: Manually find leads on LinkedIn, copy-paste data into Sheets, write cold emails one by one.

New way: Retriever AI Chrome Extension scrapes 100 leads, organizes them, and drafts outreach emails — while you’re grabbing coffee.

Old way: Check competitor sites daily for updates.

New way: Retriever monitors them for you, sends alerts, and logs changes.

Old way: Fill forms, collect feedback, or build reports manually.

New way: Retriever automates it with one click.



# The Big Picture

AI is no longer just about answering questions — it’s about taking real action.

Retriever proves that.

This isn’t theory.

It’s real-world automation anyone can use.

And when combined with Google Sheets, Gmail, and your favorite tools — it’s unstoppable.

1. Is balance (round) and clarity opposing features? 
- Many people say the taste notes are well rounded, and balanced, which sounds contradictory to the tastes notes being well seperated (= clear). 

-> If so, does longer extraction time and finer grind usually lead to greater balanced cup?


2. Is intensity and clarity opposing concepts?
- In hario v60, fewer + more frequent pours can lead to intensity. However, many people say pouring many times in small amounts lead to less clarity. Is this correct?

 3.Do clarity and acidity always go together?

-Since clarity means each taste notes standing out, it should mean acidity notes should be also standing out. As I have tried many ""clear"" cups, most of them had very outstanding and obvious acid notes that many ""beginners"" find ""too sour"". 
-> Does this mean a clear cup always lead to making its acid notes more pronounced, and well seperated from its earthy, sweet notes?

Drying is honestly the most important part. I press it with towels to get as much moisture out as possible, then let it air dry with a fan going. Sunlight helps, but I don’t leave it baking all day. Never throw it in a washer or dryer unless you want a ruined topper.

# Finding a Girlfriend in India: A Practical Guide for 2025-2026

**The most successful approach combines dating app optimization with expanded social circles, genuine self-improvement, and patience.** With India's dating app gender ratio at 3:1 (male to female), profile quality and offline social expansion are critical differentiators. Indian women consistently report valuing emotional intelligence, respect, and genuine connection over financial status or looks alone—yet 62% of dating app users are seeking committed relationships, meaning serious intent is welcomed when delivered without desperation.

The Indian dating landscape in 2025-2026 reflects a unique hybrid: modern app-based dating coexists with family involvement, and ""semi-arranged"" relationships (where couples meet independently but eventually seek family approval) are increasingly common. Success requires understanding this cultural context while actively building the social skills many Indian men weren't encouraged to develop growing up.



# Dating apps reward profile quality over everything else

India is the **second-largest dating app market globally** with over 82 million users in 2025—double the number from three years ago. The top-grossing apps are Bumble (#1), Tinder (#2), and Hinge (#3), with India-specific apps like Aisle and QuackQuack serving different needs.

**For serious relationships**, Hinge performs best with a claimed 90% success rate and 72% of matches leading to second dates. Its prompt-based system rewards thoughtful profiles over swipe volume. Aisle occupies a middle ground between dating apps and matrimonial sites—ideal for those wanting modern dating with marriage intent. For Pune specifically, both Tinder and Bumble have strong user bases, and Pune ranks among India's top cities for right-swipes per user.

The brutal math: **men match on roughly 0.6% to 5% of swipes** compared to women's 10% match rate. This means profile optimization isn't optional. Documented transformations show men going from minimal matches to 150+ likes by improving photos alone. The keys: professional-quality photos (not selfies), showing lifestyle and hobbies, including one clear face shot with genuine smile, and avoiding clichés like gym selfies, sunglasses in every photo, or group shots where you're hard to identify.

Bio mistakes kill otherwise good profiles. Avoid lazy phrases (""just ask,"" ""here for good time""), negative language (""no drama""), and material bragging. What works: specific interests that invite conversation (""coffee addict, always hunting for book recommendations""), light humor, and values-based language. On Hinge specifically, send thoughtful comments on prompts rather than generic likes—this dramatically increases response rates.

**Premium subscriptions** (₹2,000-5,000/month depending on app) are worth it in metros like Pune if you're time-constrained and have an optimized profile. However, experts consistently emphasize: premium won't help a weak profile. Fix your photos and bio first.



# What Indian women actually want differs from assumptions

Surveys of over 30,000 Indian women reveal priorities that surprise many men. The [Shaadi.com](http://Shaadi.com) study found **48.2% rank ""a person who treats me with respect"" as the top must-have**—not income, not looks. Meanwhile, 51.2% wish their partner would help with household chores, and 39.5% expect their partner to know how to cook. A QuackQuack survey found 38% of women now say physical attributes like height or abs are no longer deciding factors—emotional intelligence matters more.

The turn-offs are equally revealing. **46.7% cited rudeness to service workers** as the biggest first-date disqualifier, followed by being distracted by your phone (39.2%). Women also consistently flag possessiveness, refusing to accept mistakes, lack of emotional expression, ""mama's boy"" behavior, and expecting only her to adjust in the relationship.

Indian dating coaches observe a common pattern: men believe career success will automatically attract partners. As The Date Crew puts it, ""Women don't just seek security—they crave chemistry, connection, and compatibility."" Many accomplished professionals struggle precisely because they neglected social and emotional skills while building careers. The solution isn't abandoning ambition but developing alongside it.



# Offline strategies work better than most men realize

Dating apps aren't the only path, and for many, expanding social circles yields better results. The consistent finding across research: **shared activities create natural connection** with lower pressure than cold approaches.

**Pune offers exceptional options.** The city's [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) scene is active—groups like ""Pune Social Animals,"" ""Making Friends in Pune,"" and ""Link & Chill Pune"" host regular events. The Western Ghats provide trekking opportunities through groups organizing day trips to Sinhagad, Rajmachi, and Torna Fort. For creative pursuits, pottery workshops at Modern Clay Studio (Kondhwa) and PotteryDen (Baner Road), cooking classes at Aragma (Dhole Patil Road), and book communities like Pune Reads (silent reading at Kamala Nehru Park every Saturday) all provide natural social contexts.

Volunteering creates meaningful connections with like-minded people. Teach For India, Mentor Together, and ResQ Charitable Trust all operate in Pune with flexible volunteering options. These environments naturally filter for shared values—something dating apps can't replicate.

**The gym can work**, but group fitness classes (Zumba, CrossFit, dance) are far more effective than approaching on the weight floor. The etiquette: become a familiar face through consistency, keep initial conversations light, compliment workout gear rather than appearance, and use stretching areas where conversation flows more naturally.

The ""Three-Month Sprint"" method works: commit to saying yes to every social invitation for three months, even when you don't feel like it. Every new person knows at least one single person. Becoming a connector who introduces people to each other expands your network exponentially.



# Family and caste dynamics remain real but navigable

Indian dating is rarely a two-person affair. The cultural reality: you're stepping into someone's entire family system, and eventually they're stepping into yours. Over **90% of Indian marriages still occur within caste** according to matrimonial site data—even among educated urban populations, this expectation often remains.

Modern urban dating typically follows a pattern: date independently, then introduce the partner to family once serious (usually 6-8 months in). Use the ""slow reveal"" approach—introduce as ""friend,"" then ""colleague,"" then ""serious partner."" Before major family introductions, ensure you're financially independent or close to it—this provides negotiating power if conflicts arise.

For those navigating traditional parents while dating the modern way, financial independence is the critical prerequisite. Many Indians maintain a ""double life""—hiding dating, relationships, and social activities from parents until circumstances force the conversation. This is exhausting but extremely common. The path through requires patience; changing family mindsets takes multiple conversations over time, not single confrontations.

**Marriage pressure** typically begins around age 25, driven by ""log kya kahenge"" (what will people say?) anxiety. Coping strategies: set clear boundaries and communicate your timeline; negotiate specific timeframes (""give me two more years to focus on career""); and remember that rushed marriages under pressure often end badly. The goal is a good marriage, not a quick one.



# Self-improvement that actually matters for attraction

Dating coaches working with Indian men identify specific gaps. Many weren't encouraged to develop social skills growing up—conservative upbringings, all-boys schools, and engineering colleges with few women left them without practice. This is fixable but requires deliberate effort.

**Grooming and presentation** are non-negotiables. Regular haircuts, daily skincare appropriate for Indian climate and pollution (SPF 50+ sunscreen, face wash, moisturizer), well-maintained beard if you have one, and clean, well-fitting clothes. The Indian male grooming market exceeds ₹5,000 crore, reflecting rising awareness—being well-groomed is no longer unusual, it's expected.

**Communication skills** require specific development. Avoid interview-style questions (""what do you do, how long have you worked there""). Learn to create emotional connection through storytelling, humor, and genuine curiosity. Flirting isn't creepy—it's necessary, when done respectfully. Practice in low-stakes environments: cafes, festivals, networking events.

**Emotional intelligence** correlates directly with relationship satisfaction according to meta-analyses, yet Indian culture has traditionally discouraged emotional expression in men. The work involves developing self-awareness (understanding how your emotions impact interactions), empathy (noticing when others are upset), emotional regulation (pausing before reacting), and vulnerability (expressing feelings creates intimacy, not weakness). Journaling and therapy both help.

**Confidence** attracts, but many struggle due to upbringings that prioritized academics over self-assurance. Build genuine confidence through: accepting dating as a skill requiring practice, getting comfortable with rejection (not every woman will like you, and that's normal), achieving small wins in other life areas, and potentially working with a therapist on deep-seated issues from upbringing. Confidence differs from arrogance—the former includes genuine interest in others; the latter involves performing superiority.

Research on attractive hobbies places **reading, learning languages, playing instruments, and cooking** at the top. Intellectually stimulating and creative pursuits consistently outperform. Least attractive: ""manosphere"" content consumption, gambling, excessive drinking, and arguing online. Cooking Indian food specifically creates unique dating opportunities—several coaches recommend the ""signature move"" of inviting someone over for a homemade dish unique to your culture.



# The mistakes that ruin chances

Dating coaches and Indian women report consistent patterns. **Interview-style conversations** that feel like job applications rather than genuine connection. **Rushing intimacy**—emotional or physical—before trust is established. **Desperation signals**: immediately envisioning marriage with every match, accepting incompatible partners due to age pressure, over-messaging, or mentioning family's marriage timeline on early dates.

On apps specifically: stalking on other social platforms after being rejected, opening with sexual messages (reportedly common and universally reviled), fetishizing body types, and entitlement when things don't go as expected. The ""FOB Indian"" stereotype—awkward appearance, poor fashion, unstyled grooming—can be broken through deliberate attention to presentation.

Behaviorally, **treating dating as a transaction** (I'm successful, therefore I deserve a partner) fails because women respond to chemistry and connection, not résumés. Similarly, expecting only women to adjust in relationships, double standards about sexual history, and refusing to acknowledge faults all signal the entitlement that Indian women consistently cite as their biggest concern.



# Realistic timeline and the anti-desperation mindset

There is no standard timeline, and accepting this prevents the desperation that undermines success. Dating app users report varying experiences—some find meaningful connections within months, others experience burnout over years. Traditional arranged marriage processes also vary widely, from quick matches to multi-year searches.

**The abundance mindset** is critical: believe there are many potential compatible partners rather than treating each match as the last chance. Desperation manifests as rushing, accepting incompatibility, and projecting unrealistic expectations—all of which women detect and find unattractive. The paradox: the less you need a relationship to feel complete, the more attractive you become.

Practical anti-desperation strategies: invest seriously in your career, health, friendships, and hobbies so your life feels fulfilling independent of relationship status. Take breaks from dating apps when burned out—exhaustion amplifies desperation. Don't immediately rush to find a replacement when something ends. Observe how potential partners handle non-exciting situations rather than only evaluating chemistry.

**For Pune specifically**, a realistic weekly approach: join 2-3 Meetup groups and attend consistently, sign up for one hobby class that interests you genuinely (pottery, dance, cooking), consider volunteering with one organization, optimize dating app profiles across 2-3 platforms, and say yes to social invitations. The consistency compounds over months—not days or weeks.



# Conclusion: connection over performance

The thread running through all research: Indian women respond to genuine connection, emotional presence, and respect far more than financial status or physical perfection. The men who succeed combine practical self-improvement (grooming, fitness, communication skills) with internal work (emotional intelligence, confidence, authentic self-expression). They treat dating as a learnable skill requiring practice rather than something that should ""just happen"" when career success arrives.

The cultural context adds complexity—family involvement, caste considerations, marriage pressure—but understanding these dynamics allows navigation rather than frustration. The hybrid approach works: modern dating with eventual family approval, expanding social circles while optimizing apps, respecting tradition while asserting personal autonomy when needed.

Perhaps most importantly: **your timeline is not your cousin's timeline, your parents' timeline, or society's timeline.** A good marriage matters more than a quick one. Building a fulfilling life—one you'd be excited about even single—creates the foundation from which real connection becomes possible.",5,1767700199.0,TwentiesIndia,33,1.0,False

What should I do?,"M17 - **Text assisted using Grammarly, ""assisted"", meaning grammar corrections and synonyms, that's IT.**

Hello,

For years, I remember struggling with tiredness, no matter how much I sleep or how much rest I get. I keep trying to remember if I’ve ever felt energized for a single day, but I can't recall, I can only recall myself being tired and complaining about it all the time. It isn’t only mental; it’s physical and cognitive. This overwhelming feeling of tiredness disrupts my responsibilities and goals. Studying has become impossible because my brain feels foggy, and I struggle to focus, and lifting heavy weights at the gym is equally hopeless. After all, this exhaustion is holding me back.

It makes me even more furious when sleeping for 8 to even 12 hours doesn't help alleviate this fatigue at all. Even when adjusting diets, bulking, eating more calories, and eating healthy food. Even when refraining from using screens in the morning or any form of stimulation. Speaking of the mornings, even if I wake up, take a cold shower, and have a nutritious breakfast with coffee, I still feel mentally foggy. It’s irritating.

I genuinely can't stand this. Should I see a doctor? I think I should, but what I'm really hoping for is for some advice on lifestyle changes that can improve my state, 'cause maybe I was doing something wrong, maybe if I change some habits, I might feel better.

Here is some information that can probably explain something and get useful answers from people with the same struggle. Thank you in advance: 

1. **Excessive Digital Stimulation:** I am addicted to scrolling, video games, and YouTube. My big three. I have been trying lately to reduce all forms of digital stimulation, but it's been unbearably hard and stressful, but I think I can do it. Keep note of the ""*unbearably hard""* part.
2. **ADHD:** While I haven't been diagnosed, I found on a medical website *(Idk if I am allowed to state the same on this subreddit)* symptoms of ADHD - I have all the symptoms listed there, I'm talking every, single, one, besides squirming, and *""having excess energy"",* cuz I'm here talking about how I don't have that lol. That's why the detox I'm doing is feeling unbearably hard. I'm not saying I'm certain I have ADHD
3. **Sleep Dept and Sleep Deprivation:** Yes, I know I talked about sleeping 12 hours, but I just brought that up to note how EVEN IF I sleep long enough, I still feel foggy and tired. Lately, I've been in a lot of sleep debt, primarily because of school. Also, since I always feel tired, I can't study, I take advantage of the time when I suddenly feel okay, even if it's 12 AM, and sit down to get something done, thus sleeping late.

This is all I can give and remember for now. Please, if you experience this or recommend something, a habit, a plan, an action to take, please help. Thank you so much.",1,1767699747.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

# 7 – C.Glossen

If the first day was defined by unease, uncertainty, and the familiar pre-fight giddy energy, the following few days were defined by a craving for domestic routine.

He had to sleep with the laptop open on the floor of the bedroom with the volume turned up to the max, because, frustratingly, it wasn’t loud enough to wake him from the other room.  It bothered him for an hour the first night, and less and less after that.

He ate his leftover pizza for breakfast, with coffee with the good creamer.  He intended to find another news station, and he did at first, but after a few minutes he returned to the Spanish-language station.  It was showing a cartoon, one for young kids or toddlers.  He left it on as background noise, feeling oddly unmotivated to change it.

The news channels weren't completely useless, but they were a lot of noise and little signal.  The US was collapsing, but in pockets.  The internet was still up.  Cell phones still worked, apparently.  Nobody was living normally, but people were still living.  Utilities were failing in isolated areas, mostly electricity.  Air travel was effectively shut down, but flight was possible.  Helicopters were risky, so were cars.

Mercifully he hadn't had to hear another...he had started calling it a *freak out*.  Though of course he couldn't see what was on the screen, he figured the surviving news broadcasters were fully indoors, taking precautions, and studiously avoiding any live video.  The word *“Darwinism*” came to his mind.

He idly wondered about videos making their way around the internet, or the unlucky people who happened to be watching the news when someone foolishly panned a camera over in the wrong direction.  The people at home watching what he’d been watching, if there were any.

He recalled there was a horror movie about a video that killed you if you watched it, or something like that.  He hadn't seen it—he hated horror movies—but he imagined someone emailing a cognitohazardous video to someone they didn't like.  The final, ultimate “prank.”  In that context it was probably a net loss that the internet was still working.

He was entirely unprepared for the noise the laptop made.  He'd heard the sound thousands of times before, but it was so loud and so distorted through the tiny speakers, it almost literally made him jump out of his slippers.

He hesitated, standing in the kitchen.  The microwave only had twenty...nineteen seconds left.  There was nothing so important in that message, he thought, that it couldn't wait eighteen seconds.  But it pulled at him by an invisible string.  He caught himself staring at the open office door, and was then startled again by the microwave beeping.

He took the plate with the personal-sized pizza out—carefully, it was very hot—and put it haphazardly on the counter before rushing into the office.

And there it was.  A little envelope icon on the taskbar.  His hands weren't shaking, but he noticed he was breathing a little quickly by his standards.  Outlook was being irritatingly slow as it negotiated credentials with the Bright Hill server.  Finally,

`Sent from Outlook on iPhone`  
`---------------------------------`

 

*Oh Steven*, he thought.  *Barely any older than me, still can’t type for shit on a phone*.

He didn't think ahead, he just typed.  He wasn't craving human contact, he was craving context.  Steven was alive somewhere.  Bright Hill was still running, still doing science—but that was a safe assumption in any scenario.  It was oddly reassuring that someone somewhere was trying to understand this the same as he was, just with real and better tools.  And better food, probably.

He typed.

`---------------------------------`

 

He didn't know why he expected an immediate reply.  He sat, looking at the screen—just looking at it—for about thirty seconds before he realized what he was doing.

His desire for a response wasn't interpersonal, it was transactional.  Steven wasn't even his friend, he was his boss, his supervisor.  Knowing that Steven was alive and still on-mission was a relief because it had value for *him.*  Not to say that he minded working for him; he wasn't a bad boss.  Competent if sometimes frustrating.  The lifeline from the outside world wasn't emotionally fulfilling, it was *operationally* fulfilling.  It held the promise of continued purpose, goals to work toward, procedures and steps and checklists.  It was where he felt the most comfortable, on duty or off.

He'd asked for assignment to Boy-2 precisely because he enjoyed the solitude and the quiet; it let him think on his own terms at his own pace.  His final round at isolation training, he thought, was one of the more sedate and peaceful periods of his professional life.  He was even disappointed the first time they broke radio silence to message him with cheerful birthday wishes—though the cupcake that came with it was a pleasant surprise he accepted without hesitation.

He hadn't actually gone through his messages carefully since the GAM announcement.  None of them were interesting or relevant, though it crossed his mind that some were sent before the mobilization but after the widespread manifestation of the phenomenon.  He filed that away in case it was useful later.

He skimmed the last few unread messages.  “Click here to schedule your biannual fitness assessment.”  *That’s an easy ignore*, he thought.  “Edward-One Veterans Group Luncheon.”  *Not this year.*

When he'd cleared his inbox, he scanned the intranet again.  Someone updated the Be Somewhere Else list, adding to it.  He noted quite a few cities on the East Coast, which for him was not immediately relevant, but it could inform future taskings if that was what they had in mind for him.

When he felt that sense of restlessness sweep over him again, he paused.  He closed the lid of the laptop and forced himself to sit and inventory himself.  He was doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing.  He liked this work, he liked the conditions.  Why was he restless?

He supposed he had it after a few minutes' thought.

He remembered the headlines he'd seen…a few days prior, maybe Friday morning.  *Rash of unexplained deaths, scientists concerned,* he recalled.  *Watch our airhead anchors confidently talk circles around it while saying nothing*.  Speculation it was a disease, some flavor of SARS or a new coronavirus.

And that had reminded him of the last time he had spent any length of time “downstairs”.  In his old house, the one that was smaller and less nice but ironically had a much sleeker and more modern residence under it.  That felt different, though it took him a few more minutes to feel through why.

He decided it was the banality of that episode.  It felt more like a manageable incident, not a crisis.  He had found the memes amusing for example, found himself agreeing with a lot of them.  *It's just the flu, wear a mask, stop putting your fingers in your mouth*, he remembered thinking then.  *Case closed, sound the all-clear.*

He sidetracked his inward examination just then.  Clean House was a flexible protocol, but an imperfect one.  It was useful for a lot of different threat vectors, but an exact fit for almost none.  The hatches, and the apartment behind them, were physically resistant up to...some figures given in circular error probability and pounds per square-inch.  Whatever the actual numbers were that had flashed by on the PowerPoint slides years ago, they were abstract enough and high enough that he didn't even think about them in real terms.

The last time was different because he felt utterly, almost absurdly safe.  If he was under Clean House because of the flu, then that was a comical level of overkill.

*This...is not like that.*

Were there some horror clawing at the hatch, trying to break it down, he thought he could sleep though that.  Not literally, perhaps, but he could picture himself napping on the couch while it softly banged away on the other side.

This, though, elicited a weird unease.  It wasn't fear, it was...

I might skip many details, but I’ll share the important parts, and I’m really curious about your opinions and what you think might happen next.

Two years ago, I met a girl through a foundation we were both involved in, and over time our closeness grew a lot. I don’t believe in love at first sight, but as I got to know her, I gradually started to like her. She had a completely different aura and energy. Since we were in the same club at school, we began spending a lot of time together, and I started noticing that she was giving me strong relationship signals.

On my birthday, she made me a bracelet with her own hands. She gave it to me shyly, and I will never forget the way she looked at me that day—she looked at me differently. After that, I began showing my interest too. I would even open the car door for her; she’d get embarrassed and say, “I’m not used to polite things like this.”

As time passed, I made my intentions very clear. When she got sick, I boiled her a healing herbal drink and went to her door late at night. When she was studying for an exam, I showed up again with desserts, gifts, and coffee. I showed my love in every way. We went to theaters, met up often, and I made it obvious how I felt.

But whenever I got close or expressed my feelings, she would take a step back—and whenever I pulled away a little, she would come back. It was a really strange dynamic. (Of course, at the time I didn’t know anything about anxious/avoidant attachment styles 😊.) Months went by like this, and one day I told her I loved her. My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest—it was such a different day, the atmosphere was amazing.

When I said it, she seemed upset and said things like, “I don’t want to hurt you,” and “At first, I wanted it too, I cared too,” but she didn’t say yes or no. She said she was going through a very confusing period. I told her “I love you,” and I stepped back.

But when I created distance, she got close again—she kept texting me with one excuse or another. Encouraged by her behavior, I pursued her again, and things seemed to be going well.

Then, as a computer engineer, I decided to make a game to clarify things. After a long process, I made a computer game. In the game, she controlled herself, and at the end she faced three doors—I wanted her to choose one.

The night I sent her the game, she couldn’t say anything. The next day, she said she was really moved; she said she wanted to go through the door she chose (the “yes” door), but she also said she wanted to get to know me a bit more—despite the fact that we had already known each other for 1.5 years. She dragged the conversation out so much that it lasted four days, and by the end of those four days I couldn’t take it anymore and told her how exhausted and worn out I was. She said, “Everywhere I look, I see you, but I’m confused—I’m not sure.”

Then we met up, and we became a couple. On the evening we became official, she mentioned people around her who had broken up and said she felt sad about that (later I realized this might be related to avoidant attachment).

We became a couple, and almost immediately we had to go to different cities for various reasons. We continued the relationship long-distance. On the first day she told me she loved me, but other than that, the words “I love you” rarely came out of her mouth. It hurt me a lot, but I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to upset her.

Time passed—we were long-distance for about a month and a half. During this period, I got very tired. Sometimes she would become cold for no reason, and it was hard to talk. She didn’t want to share positive things because she believed it would “jinx” them, and she didn’t want to share negative things either because she said people always talked negatively to her—so there was often nothing left to talk about.

And because I didn’t know anything about attachment styles, I thought, “If I show how much I love her, maybe it will get better.” (Apparently, from her perspective, that was terrifying—something I learned later.) Every night I wrote long, emotional messages about how much I loved her, without realizing I was suffocating her. I even knew her ID number by heart, but she didn’t have the same sensitivity toward me. It was my first love, and I didn’t know how to act—I just loved her a lot.

Then we came back to the same city again, and the moment she arrived, she was so cold that I understood we were going to break up. When I confronted the issue, she said: “I can’t give you enough in return for your love. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I’m constantly negative. I don’t want pressure. I love my freedom. I want to be independent, and I don’t want a relationship.” It was devastating for me, and we broke up.

After the breakup, I realized she had been stalking me for about a month. When I talked to her again, she said, “I want to be with you in the future, but not right now.” And because I was being stupid, I accepted it and waited for her.

Then one day, while I was preparing a surprise for her (I still thought, “If I make her feel good, everything will get fixed,” and I still hadn’t learned about attachment styles), she sent me a message. The fact that she didn’t even consider me worthy of a face-to-face conversation was heartbreaking. She had compressed all those long months into a single message, saying something like: “Hi. At first, I had feelings, but they weren’t enough. I guess I tried to make it work because of social pressure and because people were shipping us. In the end, no real relationship feelings formed for me. I was so busy that I didn’t listen to my inner voice.” It was a horrible message—honestly, I wouldn’t write something like that even to my enemy.

I called her and told her it would be healthier to talk face-to-face. She said she had no time and was busy. Then the avoidant issue came up; I asked her how she planned to fix it, and she said, “Leave it—let me think.” For the first time, she was that cruel.

Then I asked, “So there will never be an ‘us’ again, ever?” and she said, “No, never—forever.” She said we shouldn’t see each other again for the sake of both of us. And if we ever run into each other through the foundation, we shouldn’t be enemies, but we also shouldn’t talk.

She’s an avoidant girl consumed by career ambition. I unfortunately lowered myself and suggested being friends, and she said she was afraid of giving me hope. We talked for another hour and a half and she said things like, “You deserve better; I couldn’t reciprocate,” and we said goodbye and ended it.

I was giving her endless love, and I’m deeply sad that it ended. Do you think she will come back? Is this kind of pattern natural in avoidant relationships? I know we probably shouldn’t be together, and I’ve started to cool off too. This conversation happened three weeks ago, but I still keep thinking about the future of this relationship.",1,1767699310.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

27, Australia. I’m struggling to work out what’s ADHD, meds, or life circumstances.

Current meds

	•	Vyvanse 50mg (down from 60mg)

	•	Zoloft 50mg (down from 100mg)

Vyvanse

60mg made me very overstimulated (high heart rate, no appetite, bad sleep).

50mg feels less wired, but I still have issues:

	•	Sleep is rough even if I take it at 8am

	•	If I miss a day, I feel insanely tired, flat, lazy, and unmotivated

	•	Motivation is still a struggle

	•	Evenings = irritability → crash → burnout

	•	Meds wearing off = binge eating

	•	No coffee anymore

	•	I don’t go out much at night because I’m exhausted once meds wear off

I’ve tried Ritalin SA/LA (didn’t love them). Was prescribed Concerta but didn’t try due to shortages. Starting to question if Vyvanse is the right stimulant for me.

ADHD traits still strong

	•	Hyperfixation on systems/routines/optimising

	•	Perfectionism — struggle when things aren’t “right”

	•	Rejection sensitivity

	•	Overthinking and looping

Not sure if this is ADHD, meds, lack of structure, or anxiety/OCD overlap.

Zoloft

On 50mg for \~2 months (16 months total). Anxiety feels manageable, but I feel less joy / emotionally muted at times. Unsure if it’s helping or contributing to this alongside Vyvanse.

Context

Unemployed for \~4 months, which I think has made everything worse (no structure, more rumination, fatigue). About to return to work and hoping routine helps.

Questions

	•	Is exhaustion on missed Vyvanse days normal rebound?

	•	Does this sound like Vyvanse burnout or wrong stimulant?

	•	How much does lack of structure affect this?

	•	Anyone feel less joy on long-term SSRIs even at low doses?

	•	Did things improve once you went back to work/routine?

I recently moved to a new town where I brought with me the old uniform from a well known coffee and donut establishment, applied and successfully obtained a job as a baker in this location. 
I was already fully trained in all other areas, dedicated and passionate about this job. 
And yet my first shift back from Christmas, two and a half hours into my shift I was told t leave and I cannot figure out what I did wrong. 

You know how sometimes you can kinda tell what you've done to get fired from somewhere? Even a suspicion? I've had that in some capacity, even full out seen it coming sometimes. 
Not this time. 
This time I was perfect. I was doing everything by the book, excelling in learning new things and I was valuable dammit. I was extremely valuable. I loved that job and I was damn good at it. 
You know how rare it is to have to work a shitty minimum wage job and you end up actually liking the one you find? 

It was confusing because at the time I was doing nothing but working, I even delayed my break that day to be sure the donuts were filled before I left. 
I was called into the managers office mid task. The conversation was as follows:

Me: (Jokingly) Hey! What did I do wrong? (Thinking, did I forget my logs.... forget to punch out for break?) 
Mel: Well you see, (closing door to office) we are going to have to be letting you go. 
Me: What? Okay... can I please ask for some constructive criticism about my work habits that could help me do better for future jobs? 
Mel: (In tears) you did nothing wrong. 
Me: You pinky promise? 
Mel: Yes. 
Me: Double pinky promise?
Mel: Yes. 
Me: Would you like me to finish my shift today? 
Mel: That won't be nessisary. 
Me: I was in the middle of like 3 things, do you at least want me to finish things up here before I go? 
Mel: It's okay, CoWorker will do it. 
Me: Okay. 

Then she hugged me and I left. 

Fast forward a week and I've resigned myself that they probably just lied about needing seasonal work. 
Here you don't have to give a reason for firing if your contract is under three months. (Mine was 2.5 at time of firing) 
I genuinely am so confident in the 100% of myself that I gave to being a good employee that I decide to call them asking if it would be wise to ask them for a refrence on my resume. Perhaps I could get any more information? 
That conversation was as follows: 

Me: Hello! May I please speak to Mel? 
Manager: No body by that name is employed here. 
Me: What? Mel? ..... Melissa? 
Manager: No body named Melissa is employed here. 

(WHAT THE FUCK?????)

Me: Okay. May I please speak to a manager on duty? 
Manager: Speaking. 
Me: This is (my name) and I was wondering if it would be appropriate to put you as a refrence on my resume for future employers? 
Manager: I can only legally disclose to anybody that calls whether or not I would hire you back at this location. 
Me: And would you ever hire me back? 
Manager: No, not at this time. 
Me: As in my employment was seasonal?
Manager: No. It was not. 
Me: Okay. And you're legally not allowed to give me any details as to why? 
Manager: No. 
Me: Okay. Thank you for your time. 

So now it's 3 days later and I'm seething at 5am trying to figure out what I could have done wrong and my brain keeps swirling around the suspicious circumstances. 

I know I'll never have really real answers but please, if anybody has anything that can provide some clarity using this importation I would deeply appreciate it. ",1,1767699170.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I’m 40 and a busy working mom who gets her workout in (orange theory classes) before the kids wake. My perfect caffeine intake is 2 cups a day, averaging 300-400 mg of caffeine if I had to guess. In 2026, my goal is to streamline my life so I can free up some of my mental capacity for other things. I’m looking to dial in my pods for my Nespresso (vertuo pods) so I have a default coffee routine. If you’re still with me, thank you! 

What I’m picturing is having a cup of coffee on the way to my workout at 5:30 AM. Late morning, around 9 or so, I crave a latte with that fresher denser espresso taste. For whatever reason (I live in the cold northeast) I prefer lattes iced. Does anyone have a tried and true “two pod a morning” Nespresso pod routine? Thinking of starting my day with a 7.7 pod and then making myself a single or double espresso pod latte mid morning. For reference, I don’t love the weaker pods such as Melozio, and find most of the flavored coffee pods quite watered down tasting. 

Along these lines, I see my local Costco has the Starbucks pack for a fairly decent deal and I’ve heard good things about the blonde espresso. I’m opening to either ordering through Nespresso for their pods or grabbing this pack. I just want to have the same to cups that I crave every day, unless I’m going out to meet a friend for coffee. Would love feedback.

May God heal them and grant them well-being and be with them if that's all that's available.

I go for leisure, and even if that word diminishes my problem a little, I have anxiety and social phobia, and I need someone to talk to. I need someone to help me help myself. In short, I need cognitive behavioral therapy. I need someone to talk to until we reach common ground.

Everyone wants to refer you to other clinics, of course. They all ask for tests, even though I keep saying I get them done regularly and my physical health is fine, thank God. Then they start talking about medications, their prescriptions, side effects, and so on... before even asking or understanding my medical history. I even started by telling them I wasn't interested in medication, that I didn't want to be emotionally numb, and that I had chosen an appointment with a ""psychologist"" for a reason!

At my appointment today, she seemed a little convinced and said, ""Okay, I'll give you an anxiety and phobia assessment, but I'm waiting for approval from your insurance."" I thought, ""Ugh, insurance and approval? This is going to be a real test!"" ""Fine, just wait in the waiting room until the approval comes through."" (We could have used that time for her to talk to me and give me some space.) The approval came through, and the nurse came to me with a pen and paper. The test was a complete failure; I would never give it to a friend or sibling who was complaining to me about a problem! It was all silly questions she could have asked me herself. I sat there choosing between ""yes"" and ""no,"" having already decided I wasn't going back. I finished and went to the clinic, knocking on the door to hand in the paper. The nurse came out and closed the door, saying, ""Go home. The results will be out in ten days!"" At that moment, I could smell the coffee and hear the chatter coming from the specialist's office. 🤣

I say again, thank God I'm not in dire need, and thank God I don't suffer from anything that would make me need them!

Why is it so difficult for many psychologists to understand that some patients come simply because they need someone to listen to them, talk to them, and make the most of their appointment time?

 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

\*\*PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, I PLEASE ASK THAT YOU ONLY MESSAGE ME IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

Much of the paper based ones I can see how to organise and prioritise into my bujo by leaving a few blank spreads towards the back then moving priority ones into my weekly spreads.

Is it worth considering pulling across the Outlook ones as well even though it would essentially be double handling the task management?

Do you need to capture everything in the bujo similar to the GTD system?

Any advice or pointers greatly appreciated!",4,1767698268.0,bulletjournal,1,1.0,False

1q5fsw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1q5fsw3/which_camping_cookware_set_is_most_compact_for/,Which camping cookware set is most compact for backpacking?,"When you're planning a backpacking trip, every ounce matters. Your camping cookware set can make or break your outdoor adventure, especially when you need to keep your pack light and your gear compact.

The most compact camping cookware sets for backpacking typically weigh between 8-16 ounces and nest together perfectly. Look for sets made from titanium or hard-anodized aluminum - these materials give you the best weight-to-durability ratio.

**What makes a cookware set truly compact?**

Nesting design is everything. The best backpacking cookware features pots that stack inside each other, with lids that double as plates or frying pans. Some sets even include folding handles that lock into place when cooking but fold flat for storage.

Single-wall construction beats double-wall for compactness, though you'll need to be more careful about hot spots. Most ultralight backpackers choose sets with 0.5-1 liter pot capacity - enough for one person's meals without unnecessary bulk.

**Key features to prioritize:**

- Titanium construction (lightest option)
- Nesting bowls and cups
- Folding or removable handles  
- Multi-use lids
- Integrated measuring marks

Popular compact options include single-pot systems with built-in heat exchangers, 2-3 piece nesting sets, and ultralight titanium cookware that weighs under 10 ounces total.

You can find excellent compact [camping cookware sets](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) that meet all these requirements. The right set will compress down to about the size of a large coffee mug while giving you everything needed for trail cooking.

**Size vs. functionality trade-offs:**

Remember that ultra-compact means limited cooking options. You'll mainly be boiling water, rehydrating meals, and simple one-pot cooking. If you need more versatility, consider slightly heavier sets with additional pieces.

The most compact [camping cookware set](https://athomewave.com/camping-cookware-set) for your needs depends on your cooking style, group size, and weight tolerance. Titanium wins for weight, aluminum offers better heat distribution, and stainless steel provides durability at a budget price.

Choose based on your priorities: go titanium if weight is critical, aluminum for balanced performance, or stainless steel if you're watching your budget. Whatever you pick, make sure it nests completely and fits your backpack's space constraints.",1,1767697879.0,productplace,0,1.0,False

Would love honest feedback.,"I’m part of a team building something called VCEO (Visible CEO) and I’d genuinely like input from people who think deeply about products, careers, and visibility.
The idea came from a simple observation:
many capable professionals do good work, but struggle to be seen in ways that actually create opportunity.
What we’re building is a competition-based professional ecosystem where users complete real tasks, contribute content, and participate in challenges that are publicly visible. Some tasks are managerial in nature, while others come from our sponsors. For example, a sponsor might ask participants to visit a coffee shop, take a selfie with their coffee (free or discounted), and post it on social media with a hashtag. That’s just one simple example.
Performance is scored, ranked, and showcased on a global leaderboard. Over time, participants move through roles from team lead to supervisor, manager, CXO, and ultimately VCEO. There is a yearly prize for VCEO, along with monthly and quarterly rewards to keep motivation high.
We’ve already opened registration and have close to 100 sign-ups in the first six days.

1q5fqax,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anti_Opus_Dei/comments/1q5fqax/how_opus_dei_damaged_my_relationship_with_other/,How Opus Dei damaged my relationship with other Catholics,"In this article, I'm going to explain how life in Opus Dei cut me off from other Catholics when I was in, and also led me to hit out at other Catholics when I left. The goal is to warn other Catholics that the wounds of Opus Dei people are large, especially the priests and other celibates, and so they need very careful handling.

**No Sunday mass in parishes**

When I first got involved in Opus Dei, I knew that the numeraries went to weekday mass in the oratory of the centre, said by the priest of the centre, for the numeraries only. That priest then went to the women's centre to say mass or if there were two priests, they shared. I initially imagined that all the numeraries went to Sunday mass in the local parish. Nothing was ever said about this but it became clear when I joined that Sunday mass was also in the centre. And all the masses were in Latin, the modern rite.

Throughout my time in Opus Dei, all of the numeraries went to mass every day in their centre. The exceptions were those few who lived away from centres during the week for work (including me for a year) and the occasional visit away from one's centre. No one in Opus Dei ever said: ""you can't go to mass outside the centre if there is one in the centre."" At the same time, no one (to my knowledge) decided ""right, I'm off to mass in a parish today because I feel like it"". This would have been unthinkable and felt disloyal. What's more, the daily mass routine fitted in with our lives and so was much more convenient than going elsewhere.

So for 9 years, overall, I had very little meaningful involvement in parish life, after growing up in parishes (which honestly was a grim experience anyway). Throughout my time in Opus Dei, I knew very few other local Catholics outside Opus Dei. I very rarely attended Catholic activities that were not related to Opus Dei. I was in a bubble. The only point of being with other Catholics was to try to interest them in Opus Dei and perhaps recruit them.

**The duplicitous response of Opus Dei authorities**

However, if one were to put the above to the authorities of Opus Dei, I would expect them to say something like:

""We acknowledge that \[individual\], had a bad experience and regret it. That's not what Opus Dei is about at all. We uphold the freedom of our members to be fully involved in the  life of the church.""

This has been more or less their mantra in recent years in response to various complaints, now that the problems of Opus Dei are more in the open. But this is disingenuous and duplicitous because the problem is institutional and universal, not an issue of isolated bad apples.  And the practice, as far as I know, is the same now, thanks to the iron rule of many of the same leaders who publicly pretend things have got much better.

**My disastrous involvement in parishes after Opus Dei**

When I left Opus Dei in 2004, I was a dangerous proposition for a local Catholic parish; I was a very conservative, opinionated, judgmental, self-righteous Catholic who knew quite a lot more about the Catholic faith than the average Catholic. At the same time, I was emotionally wrecked and trying to salvage some crumbs of belonging and meaning in my life. What this led me to do was get involved in my local parish in Woking, Surrey, and get involved in the adult catechesis classes. Opus Dei people are highly committed to Catholic formation (gulp)!

What happened then is something that I have needed a long time to forgive myself for. I remember one fateful meeting of the catechetical leaders, led by the late Sister Benignus, who worked full-time in the parish. I had instantly identified her as a wishy-washy liberal and was on the hunt for evidence of her heretical thinking. I can't remember what she said but it paved the way for me to spew forth my orthodox Catholic views on birth control (which I now reject), among a group of mainly married ladies, one of whom had 6 children, while I had none. I had ""done the right thing"" and put Sister Benignus in her place. As you might imagine, none of them were impressed but, being nice ladies, they didn't hit back openly and waited for me to leave first, presumably to support Sister Benignus after my broadside.

I then made an appointment to see the parish priest, the late Fr Frank Harrington, an Irishman. I expounded my views and concerns to him, eye to eye, with ""holy shamelessness"", a term of Escriva's i.e. a brass neck. He wasn't annoyed but wasn't going to get involved. His only response was that I was ""someone for the future"". That was quite a good reply, I think!

Then at the following meeting of the leaders and attendees of the catechesis group, I was basically chaperoned by one of the other leaders, undoubtedly to ensure that I didn't speak out of turn to any of the potential Catholics. I then knew the writing was on the wall and I didn't carry on. In the end, I started going to another church, but the news travelled and I disappeared from there too. Soon after, I had my psychotic breakdown and left Woking altogether.

**Thanking God for my emotional wounds**

This combination of being drilled on Catholic moral teaching in Opus Dei, being highly idealistic but also deeply wounded got me into serious trouble soon after I left Opus Dei. The painful episodes in the parish tormented me whenever I thought about them. Even now, writing this article is therapeutic as it helps me to accept and forgive myself that little bit more.

And now, I thank God that I was so wounded because I think others would have seen that in me and been less hurt by my attacks. One can even feel compassion for such a person, like a little child who has been told off in front of his class and then wants to hit his parents when he gets home.

At the same time, I don't know how much I hurt Sister Benignus. If she were still alive, I would have tried to find her and apologise. I had to forgive myself before I could feel brave enough to apologise and now she's dead. But it's the heart that counts and I have apologised to her in spirit and told her that I love her.

Anyway, what if I had been less wounded and more able to build relationships when I left Opus Dei? I think I would have become a divisive figure in a parish, perhaps even controlling. I may have had enough positive social feedback to sustain me and so not seen my faults clearly for some time. I wonder how many married members of Opus Dei are regarded in this way in their parishes. What's more, this is really the same issue with the priests and lay leaders of Opus Dei, those who manage to keep their show on the road. They have the protection of the institution to shield them from reality and can cause a lot of hurt to a lot of people over a long period of time.

**Learning from one's limitations**

Looking back, it really was a huge blessing to be so f\*\*\*ed up that all my ruses and stratagems were totally and immediately obvious to everyone around me and instantly fail in them! Painful lessons but valuable and that's what life is all about - experiencing one's limitations and learning from them, and above all accepting oneself for them and forgiving oneself. And if one does this for oneself, one is then naturally equipped to do it for others.

We're not called to be or able to be angelic, ethereal beings who can love others 100% without cost to ourselves. We are called to ""love our neighbour as ourself"". That requirement for self-care and self-acceptance is hardwired into our limited bodies, minds and the material world around us, and Jesus spelt this out clearly to us.

**Keep Opus Dei priests and lay people away from teaching the faith**

Opus Dei in the lead-up to its centenary has been ""consulting"" selected people (but not me, I don't know why!) on how it can serve the church better in future. So I finish with a friendly warning to other Catholics, which I don't think Opus Dei can hear: don't let Opus Dei people get involved in catechetics, especially the numeraries and the priests. It's not what they personally need for their healing or spiritual renewal. If they turn up to a parish or Catholic group asking to help, then suggest the cleaning rota or serving the coffees and teas after mass. If they have the humility to do it, they will grow to like it.",1,1767697649.0,Anti_Opus_Dei,0,1.0,False

1q5fmrf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5fmrf,"Jeju Hanok Café ""Damdami""","📍Café Damdami

I happened to stop by a hanok café called “Damdami” during my trip to Jeju.
True to its name, the calm and quiet atmosphere immediately drew me in.

From the outside, the café retains the beauty of traditional hanok architecture, giving it a romantic and timeless feel. Once inside, the low ceiling makes the space feel even cozier, and the warm combination of Jeju’s old-style house layout and wooden pillars creates a sense of comfort and ease.

That day, I ordered a filter coffee, daengyuji tea, and a Malenka lemon cake.
The daengyuji tea, made from Jeju’s local dangyuja citrus, had a slightly tart taste at first, followed by a gentle sweetness similar to yuzu. It felt especially unique—one of those flavors you can only truly experience in Jeju.

The Malenka lemon cake is a must-try here. The lemon aroma spreads softly without being overpowering, and the cake has a pleasantly chewy texture, making it light and not at all greasy. It paired perfectly with the tea and was ideal for enjoying slowly.

It’s not a flashy café, but that’s exactly why it stays in your memory.
If you’re looking for a quiet place to rest during a busy Jeju trip, or if you want to feel the warmth and calm that Jeju offers, I highly recommend stopping by Damdami. It’s a place where simply sitting still feels more than enough.

The sky above Gwen Swann was a clean, endless blue. No clouds. No contrails. Under her, the ocean went on forever, a dark mouth that did not blink.

She sat on a raft barely 43 square feet in area. No land. No boats. No gulls. Just water and the slap of waves. The spray soaked her jeans and the fabric stuck cold to her legs, like the sea was claiming her piece by piece.

Gwen stared ahead, her mind completely blank. She was pretty sure that five minutes ago, she’d been at the office, half-dead from overtime, staring at a spreadsheet and wondering if coffee counted as dinner.

Gwen thought, ‘Kidnapped? By who, exactly.

‘I am a soft target with nothing to my name. What, someone hauled me out here to inherit my student loans and maxed-out Visa?’

A translucent screen flickered into view at the corner of her vision, like a heads-up display from a game. Lines of text scrolled by.

\[Global Chat\]:

\[Okay, no joke, where the hell are we?\]

\[I was literally about to clutch a pentakill and now I’m in the ocean. This has to be a prank.\]

\[Someone tell me I’m dreaming. Or knock me out. Either works.\]

\[Is anyone else here actually real? I don’t see a single person.\]

\[I’m gonna throw up. I get seasick on this boat. This is not funny.\]

\[Bro, calling this thing a boat is generous. My dog’s crate is bigger.\]

\[Seasick? Try having deep-sea phobia. I swear something huge just swam under my raft.\]

\[Nana, if you’re watching from heaven, please don’t let me die like this!\]

Gwen exhaled quietly. ‘Good. I am not alone. At least this nightmare has company.’

The chat continued to dissolve into chaos, but before she could read more, another voice cut through everything. Cold. Flat. Inhuman. It didn’t come from the screen. It came from inside her head.

\[Congratulations. You have entered the Ocean Survival Game. Player ID: 29,786,510.

\[A Beginner Blind Box has been delivered to your vessel. Happy sailing.\]

Right on cue, something dropped from above. A small wooden box hit the raft with a dull thump and slid to a stop near Gwen’s feet.

A large question mark was painted on the lid. So this was the so-called Beginner Blind Box.

Only then did she notice the rest of her starting equipment. A fishing rod lay near the edge of the raft, old enough to look like it had lived several past lives.

Next to it sat an iron grappling hook, spotted with rust and tied to a fraying rope.

The moment she focused on them, translucent stat panels popped up in front of her eyes.

\[Worn Fishing Rod\]

\[Quality: Poor\]

\[Description: Standard beginner item. Everyone gets one. Can be used for fishing.\]

\[Worn Throwing Hook\]

\[Everyone gets one of these starter tools. Use it to snag whatever junk’s floating by on the waves.\]

\[Dilapidated Wooden Raft\]

\[Sturdiness: 1 (May fall apart at any time.)\]

\[Speed: 0 (It’s a busted raft. Manage your expectations.)\]

\[Storage Capacity: 0/10 slots\]

\[Durability: 100/100\]

\[Upgrade requirements: 20 Wood, 10 Cloth, 10 Seaweeds, 1 Iron Ore, 1 Dull Pearl.\]

\[(Upgrade unavailable. Insufficient materials.)\]

After reading through the raft’s stats, Gwen finally understood just how bad things were.

Five billion people around the world had been dumped into this so-called survival game. Everyone started the same way. One useless raft. No food. No fresh water. And a three-day countdown.

Technically, a person could survive about a week without food if they were careful. But the ocean storm coming in three days would wipe out this raft without even trying. A structural rating of one might as well be a death sentence.

If she wanted to live, upgrading this floating pile of wood wasn’t optional. It was everything.

Gwen had never been the kind of person who wasted energy complaining about fate. When she realized something couldn’t be changed, she made the only sensible choice. She adapted, and she did it fast.

That was how the world worked. Survival of the fittest. The strong stayed standing, and everyone else got swept aside.

She understood that rule instinctively. So while the global chat was still packed with people shouting, whining, and melting down in real time, Gwen was already moving, quietly collecting whatever she could get her hands on.

She wrapped the rope of the throwing hook securely around her wrist and locked onto a wooden plank drifting about fifteen feet straight ahead.

The metal hook sliced through the air with a sharp whistle. It grazed the edge of the plank and missed.

The hook splashed into the water and vanished beneath the surface, swallowed whole by the sea.

Gwen pulled the rope, reeling the hook back in.

She had underestimated how fast the hook traveled, and she hadn’t accounted for the way the current nudged floating debris forward. Lesson learned. On the second throw, she adjusted her timing and released.

The hook landed squarely in the middle of the plank.

Nailed it.

She hauled it in and noticed a strip of bright green seaweed tangled around the bottom.

\[Item acquired: 1 Wood, 1 Seaweed\]

A buy-one-get-one deal. She wasn’t complaining.

Everything she collected was automatically transferred into the raft’s storage. A notification popped up as the capacity updated to 2 out of 500.

No breaks. Gwen’s eyes were already on the next piece of debris.

\[Wood+1\]

\[Cloth +1\]

\[Seaweed +1\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Three hours later, Gwen barely had to think about it anymore. Her wrist felt sore, sure, but her accuracy was ridiculous. Anything she aimed at might as well have been glued to the hook. Misses were rare.

She checked her inventory. Twenty three pieces of wood. Eleven cloth. Ten seaweed.

That was enough to upgrade the raft. What she still needed was iron ore and that dull-looking pearl. And she had no clue where either of those came from.

Out of curiosity, she glanced back at the global chat. The conversation had moved on. Everyone was now arguing about the newbie loot boxes.

\[Are you kidding me? Five pieces of wood. That’s it?\]

\[I got two bottles of water. Best day of my life. I was about to pass out.\]

\[Five wood gang here.\]

\[Same. Five wood.\]

\[Same here.\]

\[So the devs really went full gacha scam on us, huh?\]

\[This is supposed to be a starter reward, not a slap in the face.\]

\[Cry more. Check out what I pulled.\]

One message stood out immediately. Someone had posted a full item card.

\[Shark Tooth Dagger\]

\[Quality: Common\]

\[A dagger made from shark teeth. Sharp enough. Deals double damage to sharks.\]

‘Wait, weapons are in the loot boxes too?’ Gwen thought, surprised.

Gwen scrolled. Weapon pulls were rare. Most people got basic materials. Some luckier players scored food, fresh water, binoculars, or flint.

One insanely lucky player claimed they had pulled one hundred dull pearls.

Gwen’s eyes narrowed. The raft upgrade required one pearl. She still had no idea how to get one, and it was obvious these were way more valuable than wood or cloth.

The pearl guy wasted no time. \[Selling extra pearls. One pearl for 200 wood, cloth, or seaweed.\]

\[Two hundred wood for one pearl? Just mug us next time.\]

\[I fished up a giant oyster with the starter rod. Cracked it open, pearl inside. If you want pearls, go fishing.\]

\[Fishing my ass. I’ve been sitting here for an hour and nothing’s biting.\]

\[Same. Didn’t catch a thing and almost fell in.\]

\[Basic fishing tip. You need bait. I tore off a piece of bread from a loot box, tied it to the hook, instant fish.\]

\[So what you’re saying is I need food to get food?\]

\[No bait means no fish. No fish means no food. This game is evil.\]

\[Selling one piece of wheat bread, 150 grams, for 200 wood. First come, first served.\]

\[Dude, that’s even worse than the pearl guy.\]

\[I would rather starve than trade my pride for bread.\]

\[Trading newbie blind box for five pieces of wheat bread.\]

\[People are selling blind boxes already?\]

\[My luck sucks anyway. Five wood isn’t doing me any favors.\]

Everyone was brand new, all stuck with the same problems. No food. No water. The moment someone had extras, prices went through the roof.

Gwen felt the faint tug of hunger in her stomach after hours of work, but it was manageable. She wasn’t desperate yet. Trading valuable resources for food now would just mean grinding for someone else’s benefit.

She picked up the blind box resting on the raft. Trading it for bread was probably the smart move. Still, Gwen hesitated. Compared to five pieces of wood, taking a shot at luck didn’t seem like the worst idea in the world.",1,1767696516.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

1q5fcvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q5fcvv/5_stages_of_friendship_most_people_never_get_past/,5 stages of friendship (most people never get past stage 3),"Ever noticed how a ton of your “friends” are just people you kind of talk to sometimes? You have work friends, gym friends, party friends. But how many of them could you actually call at 2am when your life is falling apart? That number is usually… small. Like, *really* small.

And that’s not a “you” problem. It’s just where most friendships naturally plateau. After looking into this a lot more—through research, social psych books, and even podcasts on intimacy—it became clear that friendship goes way deeper than most of us realize. Way beyond just “vibing” or “doing stuff together.”

But most people stop at stage 2 or 3. Not because they’re lazy or fake, but because deeper friendship requires emotional openness, consistency, and facing some pretty uncomfortable stuff. 

Here’s what the research (not TikTok) shows about the 5 stages of friendship, and why *real* closeness is so rare. Let’s make it less rare.

1. **Stranger to acquaintance**  
   *You meet. You exchange names. Maybe a few polite facts. It ends there unless someone initiates more.*

   - Psychology professor Jeffrey Hall found in his 2018 friendship study that it takes **around 50 hours** to move from acquaintance to casual friend. That’s a lot of small talk and “hey what do you do” convos.
   - These connections are surface-level but still functional. You know their face and maybe their dog’s name. That’s it.

2. **Acquaintance to casual friend**  
   *You start seeing them more regularly. There’s shared context: work, gym class, mutual friends.*

   - Hall’s research also showed that at **90+ hours**, you start getting into casual friend territory. You can joke around. You may know their coffee order. But the convo is still kind of curated.
   - This is where most social media “friends” stop. You “know of” each other but aren’t really emotionally invested.

3. **Casual friend to meaningful friend**  
   *Now you’re sharing more personal details. Talking about values, struggles, not just schedules and shows.*

   - According to Shasta Nelson (author of *Frientimacy*), this stage involves **“consistency + vulnerability + positivity”**. All *three* are needed to push past emotional inertia.
   - Research from the University of Kansas shows **it takes about 200 hours** together to get to this level. Not just time, but *quality* time. Think: late-night convos, real arguments, trips together.
   - Problem is, this is where things can get “risky.” You start realizing: do we really align, or did we just like the same memes?

4. **Friendship intimacy**  
   *You feel understood, seen, and accepted. You support each other in real ways. The relationship feels secure.*

   - Dr. Vivek Murthy (U.S. Surgeon General) talks about this in *Together*: that deep friendship protects against loneliness better than romantic relationships in some cases. But we rarely invest in it.
   - This stage often requires **repairing ruptures**. Disappointments, calling each other out, being awkwardly honest. Most avoid it—so friendships die quietly.
   - Also, this level of trust can trigger old attachment wounds if someone grew up without stable relationships. That’s why many self-sabotage here without realizing.

5. **Chosen family**  
   *This is rare. But real. These are the friends you’d drop everything for. They *know* you—past, flaws, dreams—and love you anyway.*

   - Esther Perel explains in her podcast *Where Should We Begin* that chosen family is built by “mutual rituals of care.” You show up, over and over. That builds “earned intimacy.”
   - These friends don’t just watch your stories. They’ll sit with you through your worst nights, call you on your B.S., and still remember your big interview.
   - The difference? This kind of bonded friendship is **active**, not passive. It isn’t built on vibes. It’s built on loyalty and shared history.

Most adults stop at stage 3 because our schedules are packed, we’re scared of emotional vulnerability, and we assume closeness either “clicks or it doesn’t.” But that’s wrong. Research shows deep friendship isn’t magical. It’s **intentional**.

*Quick ways to deepen a friendship (based on relational psych research):*

- **Ask better questions**, like “What’s something you wish more people knew about you?” (The *36 Questions* from Aron et al. are great for this)
- **Initiate more**. Reach out when nothing’s wrong. Plan stuff.
- **Name the friendship**. Literally say, “I really value our friendship” or “Can I be real with you for a sec?”
- **Repair ruptures**. Apologize when you mess up. Give grace when others do.
- **Create rituals**. Monthly cafe catch-ups, Sunday walks, shared hobby—predictable time = deeper bonding over time.

Friendship isn’t less important than romantic or family relationships. The problem is, no one teaches us how to build *real* ones. So we settle for stage 3.

Let’s stop settling.

After reading through the raft’s stats, Gwen finally understood just how bad things were.

Five billion people around the world had been dumped into this so-called survival game. Everyone started the same way. One useless raft. No food. No fresh water. And a three-day countdown.

Technically, a person could survive about a week without food if they were careful. But the ocean storm coming in three days would wipe out this raft without even trying. A structural rating of one might as well be a death sentence.

If she wanted to live, upgrading this floating pile of wood wasn’t optional. It was everything.

Gwen had never been the kind of person who wasted energy complaining about fate. When she realized something couldn’t be changed, she made the only sensible choice. She adapted, and she did it fast.

That was how the world worked. Survival of the fittest. The strong stayed standing, and everyone else got swept aside.

She understood that rule instinctively. So while the global chat was still packed with people shouting, whining, and melting down in real time, Gwen was already moving, quietly collecting whatever she could get her hands on.

She wrapped the rope of the throwing hook securely around her wrist and locked onto a wooden plank drifting about fifteen feet straight ahead.

The metal hook sliced through the air with a sharp whistle. It grazed the edge of the plank and missed.

The hook splashed into the water and vanished beneath the surface, swallowed whole by the sea.

Gwen pulled the rope, reeling the hook back in.

She had underestimated how fast the hook traveled, and she hadn’t accounted for the way the current nudged floating debris forward. Lesson learned. On the second throw, she adjusted her timing and released.

The hook landed squarely in the middle of the plank.

Nailed it.

She hauled it in and noticed a strip of bright green seaweed tangled around the bottom.

\[Item acquired: 1 Wood, 1 Seaweed\]

A buy-one-get-one deal. She wasn’t complaining.

Everything she collected was automatically transferred into the raft’s storage. A notification popped up as the capacity updated to 2 out of 500.

No breaks. Gwen’s eyes were already on the next piece of debris.

Three hours later, Gwen barely had to think about it anymore. Her wrist felt sore, sure, but her accuracy was ridiculous. Anything she aimed at might as well have been glued to the hook. Misses were rare.

She checked her inventory. Twenty three pieces of wood. Eleven cloth. Ten seaweed.

That was enough to upgrade the raft. What she still needed was iron ore and that dull-looking pearl. And she had no clue where either of those came from.

Out of curiosity, she glanced back at the global chat. The conversation had moved on. Everyone was now arguing about the newbie loot boxes.

\[Are you kidding me? Five pieces of wood. That’s it?\]

\[I got two bottles of water. Best day of my life. I was about to pass out.\]

\[Five wood gang here.\]

\[Same. Five wood.\]

\[Same here.\]

\[So the devs really went full gacha scam on us, huh?\]

\[This is supposed to be a starter reward, not a slap in the face.\]

\[Cry more. Check out what I pulled.\]

One message stood out immediately. Someone had posted a full item card.

\[Shark Tooth Dagger\]

\[Quality: Common\]

\[A dagger made from shark teeth. Sharp enough. Deals double damage to sharks.\]

‘Wait, weapons are in the loot boxes too?’ Gwen thought, surprised.

Gwen scrolled. Weapon pulls were rare. Most people got basic materials. Some luckier players scored food, fresh water, binoculars, or flint.

One insanely lucky player claimed they had pulled one hundred dull pearls.

Gwen’s eyes narrowed. The raft upgrade required one pearl. She still had no idea how to get one, and it was obvious these were way more valuable than wood or cloth.

The pearl guy wasted no time. \[Selling extra pearls. One pearl for 200 wood, cloth, or seaweed.\]

\[Two hundred wood for one pearl? Just mug us next time.\]

\[I fished up a giant oyster with the starter rod. Cracked it open, pearl inside. If you want pearls, go fishing.\]

\[Same. Didn’t catch a thing and almost fell in.\]

\[Basic fishing tip. You need bait. I tore off a piece of bread from a loot box, tied it to the hook, instant fish.\]

\[So what you’re saying is I need food to get food?\]

\[No bait means no fish. No fish means no food. This game is evil.\]

\[Selling one piece of wheat bread, 150 grams, for 200 wood. First come, first served.\]

\[I would rather starve than trade my pride for bread.\]

\[People are selling blind boxes already?\]

\[My luck sucks anyway. Five wood isn’t doing me any favors.\]

Everyone was brand new, all stuck with the same problems. No food. No water. The moment someone had extras, prices went through the roof.

Gwen felt the faint tug of hunger in her stomach after hours of work, but it was manageable. She wasn’t desperate yet. Trading valuable resources for food now would just mean grinding for someone else’s benefit.

She picked up the blind box resting on the raft. Trading it for bread was probably the smart move. Still, Gwen hesitated. Compared to five pieces of wood, taking a shot at luck didn’t seem like the worst idea in the world.",1,1767696394.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

This method produces a marked, rich, and dense profile with zero bitterness.

**The Recipe:**

* **Coffee:** 15g (freshly ground)
* **Water:** 185ml @ 96°C
* **Method:** Inverted start -> Upright steep

**The Process:**

1. Inverted setup. Add coffee and water.
2. Give it **3 stirs**.
3. Screw the cap on.
4. **The Critical Step:** While still inverted, press the plunger until **all air is removed** and liquid touches the filter.
5. **Flip immediately.** Do not wait.
6. Let it sit on the cup for **1-2 minutes**.
7. Press slowly.

**Why purge air and flip immediately?** If you steep inverted or flip with air inside, wet grounds often get stuck to the rubber piston and stop extracting. By removing the air and flipping right away, the coffee bed settles at the bottom (on the filter) and stays fully submerged in the water. No grounds stuck to the rubber, just full, consistent extraction.",1,1767696247.0,AeroPress,3,0.6,False

The sky above Gwen Swann was a clean, endless blue. No clouds. No contrails. Under her, the ocean went on forever, a dark mouth that did not blink.

She sat on a raft barely 43 square feet in area. No land. No boats. No gulls. Just water and the slap of waves. The spray soaked her jeans and the fabric stuck cold to her legs, like the sea was claiming her piece by piece.

Gwen stared ahead, her mind completely blank. She was pretty sure that five minutes ago, she’d been at the office, half-dead from overtime, staring at a spreadsheet and wondering if coffee counted as dinner.

Gwen thought, ‘Kidnapped? By who, exactly.

‘I am a soft target with nothing to my name. What, someone hauled me out here to inherit my student loans and maxed-out Visa?’

A translucent screen flickered into view at the corner of her vision, like a heads-up display from a game. Lines of text scrolled by.

\[Global Chat\]:

\[Okay, no joke, where the hell are we?\]

\[I was literally about to clutch a pentakill and now I’m in the ocean. This has to be a prank.\]

\[Someone tell me I’m dreaming. Or knock me out. Either works.\]

\[Is anyone else here actually real? I don’t see a single person.\]

\[I’m gonna throw up. I get seasick on this boat. This is not funny.\]

\[Bro, calling this thing a boat is generous. My dog’s crate is bigger.\]

\[Seasick? Try having deep-sea phobia. I swear something huge just swam under my raft.\]

\[Nana, if you’re watching from heaven, please don’t let me die like this!\]

Gwen exhaled quietly. ‘Good. I am not alone. At least this nightmare has company.’

The chat continued to dissolve into chaos, but before she could read more, another voice cut through everything. Cold. Flat. Inhuman. It didn’t come from the screen. It came from inside her head.

\[Congratulations. You have entered the Ocean Survival Game. Player ID: 29,786,510.

\[All five billion players have successfully entered the game. The Grand Sea Route is now officially open. Please remember the following navigation rules.

\[From this point forward, your life will take place at sea. You may collect resources by salvaging floating debris, fishing, and exploring islands in order to upgrade your vessel and survive.

\[Warning: the storm will destroy all vessels with a Sturdiness Value below five. Upgrade your ship to ensure survival.

\[A Beginner Blind Box has been delivered to your vessel. Happy sailing.\]

Right on cue, something dropped from above. A small wooden box hit the raft with a dull thump and slid to a stop near Gwen’s feet.

A large question mark was painted on the lid. So this was the so-called Beginner Blind Box.

Only then did she notice the rest of her starting equipment. A fishing rod lay near the edge of the raft, old enough to look like it had lived several past lives.

Next to it sat an iron grappling hook, spotted with rust and tied to a fraying rope.

The moment she focused on them, translucent stat panels popped up in front of her eyes.

My little nest feels so warm and comfortable. I stop fighting; I stop arguing against my mind and let my body take over. My left arm removes the balmy quilt, my right arm pushes on the soft mattress. My feet hit the floor, quads and glutes straighten me up. My body turns, grabs the quilt, and makes my bed. I watch as it opens blinds and windows, letting the morning coolness freshen my flat, before doing a mandatory toilet stop.  
My body takes a warm shower. The body soap smells like ‘energy’. Why do they name them after abstract concepts? It has a chilling touch on my skin.  
Shave, comb, dress. I look at my reflection in the misted mirror. Dashing as usual. Well done, body. My face experiments with different shades of smile until it finds the right one. Yes, this one will appeal to my colleagues.

Waiting for the tub, I desire coffee. The body goes to the yellow and brown coffee stand. The young waitress wears her best smile since last week. I watch as our vocal apparatus and body language dance together until a paper cup warms my hand and nickel coins temper hers.  
I love the tub part. People are standing, sitting, holding warm beverages, reading books or their phone. Some look up from time to time and exchange social protocols made of smiles and nods. I feel part of a whole.

At work, I observe the body walking through a maze of glass doors and colourful walls adorned with generic company values. It greets coworkers along the way using codified jokes which match levels of familiarity.  
I stare at the face reflecting on the computer screen until an OS logo appears. Another part of the frontal lob takes over. It thinks logically and in patterns. I watch it continue building systems, translating ideas into computer code for hours to come.

I retreat deeper. It’s safe, warm, and comfy here. The shell takes care of everything. I can watch, daydream, imagine a life of travel and adventures with true friendship and love, while the body takes care of real life.

I glance up to see my coworkers blissfully grinding.

She sat on a raft barely 43 square feet in area. No land. No boats. No gulls. Just water and the slap of waves. The spray soaked her jeans and the fabric stuck cold to her legs, like the sea was claiming her piece by piece.

Gwen stared ahead, her mind completely blank. She was pretty sure that five minutes ago, she’d been at the office, half-dead from overtime, staring at a spreadsheet and wondering if coffee counted as dinner.

Gwen thought, ‘Kidnapped? By who, exactly.

‘I am a soft target with nothing to my name. What, someone hauled me out here to inherit my student loans and maxed-out Visa?’

A translucent screen flickered into view at the corner of her vision, like a heads-up display from a game. Lines of text scrolled by.

\[Global Chat\]:

\[Okay, no joke, where the hell are we?\]

\[I was literally about to clutch a pentakill and now I’m in the ocean. This has to be a prank.\]

\[Someone tell me I’m dreaming. Or knock me out. Either works.\]

\[Is anyone else here actually real? I don’t see a single person.\]

\[I’m gonna throw up. I get seasick on this boat. This is not funny.\]

\[Bro, calling this thing a boat is generous. My dog’s crate is bigger.\]

\[Seasick? Try having deep-sea phobia. I swear something huge just swam under my raft.\]

\[Nana, if you’re watching from heaven, please don’t let me die like this!\]

Gwen exhaled quietly. ‘Good. I am not alone. At least this nightmare has company.’

The chat continued to dissolve into chaos, but before she could read more, another voice cut through everything. Cold. Flat. Inhuman. It didn’t come from the screen. It came from inside her head.

\[Congratulations. You have entered the Ocean Survival Game. Player ID: 29,786,510.

\[All five billion players have successfully entered the game. The Grand Sea Route is now officially open. Please remember the following navigation rules.

\[From this point forward, your life will take place at sea. You may collect resources by salvaging floating debris, fishing, and exploring islands in order to upgrade your vessel and survive.

\[During the New Player Protection Period, players are prohibited from attacking one another. Violations will result in system penalties.

\[The New Player Protection Period lasts three days. During this time, overall difficulty is significantly reduced. Use this window wisely and gather supplies as quickly as possible.

\[You have one life. Please do not waste it.

\[After the protection period ends, the global event “Ocean Storm” will begin.

\[Warning: the storm will destroy all vessels with a Sturdiness Value below five. Upgrade your ship to ensure survival.

\[A Beginner Blind Box has been delivered to your vessel. Happy sailing.\]

Right on cue, something dropped from above. A small wooden box hit the raft with a dull thump and slid to a stop near Gwen’s feet.

A large question mark was painted on the lid. So this was the so-called Beginner Blind Box.

Only then did she notice the rest of her starting equipment. A fishing rod lay near the edge of the raft, old enough to look like it had lived several past lives.

Next to it sat an iron grappling hook, spotted with rust and tied to a fraying rope.

The moment she focused on them, translucent stat panels popped up in front of her eyes.

\[Worn Fishing Rod\]

\[Quality: Poor\]

\[Description: Standard beginner item. Everyone gets one. Can be used for fishing.\]

\[Worn Throwing Hook\]

\[Quality: Poor\]

\[Everyone gets one of these starter tools. Use it to snag whatever junk’s floating by on the waves.\]

\[Dilapidated Wooden Raft\]

\[Sturdiness: 1 (May fall apart at any time.)\]

\[Speed: 0 (It’s a busted raft. Manage your expectations.)\]

\[Storage Capacity: 0/10 slots\]

\[Durability: 100/100\]

\[Upgrade requirements: 20 Wood, 10 Cloth, 10 Seaweeds, 1 Iron Ore, 1 Dull Pearl.\]

\[(Upgrade unavailable. Insufficient materials.)\]

After reading through the raft’s stats, Gwen finally understood just how bad things were.

Five billion people around the world had been dumped into this so-called survival game. Everyone started the same way. One useless raft. No food. No fresh water. And a three-day countdown.

Technically, a person could survive about a week without food if they were careful. But the ocean storm coming in three days would wipe out this raft without even trying. A structural rating of one might as well be a death sentence.

If she wanted to live, upgrading this floating pile of wood wasn’t optional. It was everything.

Gwen had never been the kind of person who wasted energy complaining about fate. When she realized something couldn’t be changed, she made the only sensible choice. She adapted, and she did it fast.

That was how the world worked. Survival of the fittest. The strong stayed standing, and everyone else got swept aside.

She understood that rule instinctively. So while the global chat was still packed with people shouting, whining, and melting down in real time, Gwen was already moving, quietly collecting whatever she could get her hands on.

She wrapped the rope of the throwing hook securely around her wrist and locked onto a wooden plank drifting about fifteen feet straight ahead.

The metal hook sliced through the air with a sharp whistle. It grazed the edge of the plank and missed.

The hook splashed into the water and vanished beneath the surface, swallowed whole by the sea.

Gwen pulled the rope, reeling the hook back in.

She had underestimated how fast the hook traveled, and she hadn’t accounted for the way the current nudged floating debris forward. Lesson learned. On the second throw, she adjusted her timing and released.

The hook landed squarely in the middle of the plank.

Nailed it.

She hauled it in and noticed a strip of bright green seaweed tangled around the bottom.

\[Item acquired: 1 Wood, 1 Seaweed\]

A buy-one-get-one deal. She wasn’t complaining.

Everything she collected was automatically transferred into the raft’s storage. A notification popped up as the capacity updated to 2 out of 500.

No breaks. Gwen’s eyes were already on the next piece of debris.

\[Wood+1\]

\[Cloth +1\]

\[Seaweed +1\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Three hours later, Gwen barely had to think about it anymore. Her wrist felt sore, sure, but her accuracy was ridiculous. Anything she aimed at might as well have been glued to the hook. Misses were rare.

She checked her inventory. Twenty three pieces of wood. Eleven cloth. Ten seaweed.

That was enough to upgrade the raft. What she still needed was iron ore and that dull-looking pearl. And she had no clue where either of those came from.

Out of curiosity, she glanced back at the global chat. The conversation had moved on. Everyone was now arguing about the newbie loot boxes.

\[Are you kidding me? Five pieces of wood. That’s it?\]

\[I got two bottles of water. Best day of my life. I was about to pass out.\]

\[Five wood gang here.\]

\[Same. Five wood.\]

\[Same here.\]

\[So the devs really went full gacha scam on us, huh?\]

\[This is supposed to be a starter reward, not a slap in the face.\]

\[Cry more. Check out what I pulled.\]

One message stood out immediately. Someone had posted a full item card.

\[Shark Tooth Dagger\]

\[Quality: Common\]

\[A dagger made from shark teeth. Sharp enough. Deals double damage to sharks.\]

‘Wait, weapons are in the loot boxes too?’ Gwen thought, surprised.

Gwen scrolled. Weapon pulls were rare. Most people got basic materials. Some luckier players scored food, fresh water, binoculars, or flint.

One insanely lucky player claimed they had pulled one hundred dull pearls.

Gwen’s eyes narrowed. The raft upgrade required one pearl. She still had no idea how to get one, and it was obvious these were way more valuable than wood or cloth.

The pearl guy wasted no time. \[Selling extra pearls. One pearl for 200 wood, cloth, or seaweed.\]

\[Two hundred wood for one pearl? Just mug us next time.\]

\[I fished up a giant oyster with the starter rod. Cracked it open, pearl inside. If you want pearls, go fishing.\]

\[Fishing my ass. I’ve been sitting here for an hour and nothing’s biting.\]

\[Same. Didn’t catch a thing and almost fell in.\]

\[Basic fishing tip. You need bait. I tore off a piece of bread from a loot box, tied it to the hook, instant fish.\]

\[So what you’re saying is I need food to get food?\]

\[No bait means no fish. No fish means no food. This game is evil.\]

\[Selling one piece of wheat bread, 150 grams, for 200 wood. First come, first served.\]

\[Dude, that’s even worse than the pearl guy.\]

\[I would rather starve than trade my pride for bread.\]

\[Trading newbie blind box for five pieces of wheat bread.\]

\[People are selling blind boxes already?\]

\[My luck sucks anyway. Five wood isn’t doing me any favors.\]

Everyone was brand new, all stuck with the same problems. No food. No water. The moment someone had extras, prices went through the roof.

Gwen felt the faint tug of hunger in her stomach after hours of work, but it was manageable. She wasn’t desperate yet. Trading valuable resources for food now would just mean grinding for someone else’s benefit.

She picked up the blind box resting on the raft. Trading it for bread was probably the smart move. Still, Gwen hesitated. Compared to five pieces of wood, taking a shot at luck didn’t seem like the worst idea in the world.",1,1767696058.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

By simply putting my everyday purchases — groceries, gas, dining, rideshares — on this card, I’ve already earned over $5,000 in BTC.

What makes it so powerful? Unlike regular cashback cards, every reward goes directly into crypto, and you get to choose which coin you earn. I stick with Bitcoin, but Gemini lets you pick from 50+ cryptos, so you can grow your favorite assets while spending normally.

Here’s how the rewards stack up:
	•	4% back on gas, EV charging, transit, and rideshare (up to $300/month)
	•	3% back on dining
	•	2% back on groceries
	•	1% back on everything else

No annual fee, no foreign transaction fees — just pure crypto rewards with every swipe.

And here’s the exciting part: if BTC or other cryptos go up, the rewards you’ve already earned can grow 3x, 4x, or even more over time. So every coffee, ride, or grocery trip can potentially turn into serious crypto gains.

The best part? You can start earning instantly, and if you’ll get $50 in free crypto just for signing up!

1q5f7at,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q5f7at/they_left_notes/,They left notes,"Every morning, something in my room hits me like a baseball bat to the skull. Not broken. Not missing. Just… adjusted. 

It started with a photograph on the wall. A framed picture of my parents at the beach was reversed. Not flipped upside down—mirrored, like someone had turned it to face the wall and then changed their mind. I assumed I’d done it half-asleep. I turned it back and forgot.

The next morning, my desk drawer was slightly open. Not enough to notice at first—but inside, a single fingerless glove I’d never owned rested atop my pens.

The coffee was wrong too. Same mug. Same brand. But it tasted like burnt memory. Like someone had brewed it from my recollection of yesterday rather than reality.

By the end of the week, I started keeping notes:

Monday: Bathroom mirror smudged high, beyond my reach. A hairpin balanced on the edge of the sink. I hadn’t owned a hairpin in years.
Tuesday: Bedroom lamp moved closer to the bed. A small puddle of black liquid pooled under it—coffee? oil? blood? I couldn’t tell.
Wednesday: Left shoe by the door. Right shoe in the bedroom. Each stuffed with a folded note in my handwriting, but the words were wrong. Twisted. “You forgot again.”

It didn’t feel like a break-in. It felt like edits. Helpful ones. The lamp made reading easier. The shoes were exactly where I’d stepped out of them. But helpful for whom?

I set up a camera in the corner. Eight hours of footage showed nothing but stillness. The room stayed exactly as I’d left it.

Until morning.

I woke up to a note on the dresser, written in my handwriting:
“Use the bat.”

I laughed. Nervous. Real, but hollow. It sounded better than screaming. I grabbed the nearest thing: a baseball bat. The leather handle was sticky. Warm. Like it had been used yesterday.

The next morning, the note was back, folded with surgical precision.

After that, the edits became personal. A jacket I hadn’t worn in years was hanging by the door. My alarm went off five minutes early—just enough to catch the bus I usually miss. A book sat open on my desk, bookmarked at the chapter where I’d given up years ago. My coffee cup was on the floor, smashed. Tiny teeth marks in the rim.

One night, I stayed awake. Sat on the bed until dawn. Lights on. Heart steady. Waiting.

Nothing happened.

At sunrise, I went into the bathroom and froze.

The mirror was spotless. No smudges. No fingerprints. Taped to the corner was a yellowed note. My handwriting again.

Dated three years ago:
“You always forget this part.”

The realization hit like ice water.

The room wasn’t changing. It was the only thing staying the same.

The edits weren’t new. They were permanent fixtures of a life I’d spent years building. The coffee, the lamp, the shoes… the bat… all carefully placed. Intentionally. For me. By me. Or a version of me I no longer remembered.

I wasn’t being haunted by a stranger.

I was being curated.

I wasn’t waking up to a changed room. I was waking up to a changed mind.

Every night, I reset.
The room remembered.

Before bed, I wrote one final note:
“If you’re reading this, don’t panic. It’s always been like this.”

I woke up calm.
The note was gone.
The bat was leaning against the wall, slick with something I didn’t want to name.

The room felt… just right.",1,1767695884.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Then throughout the months she gets really angry throwing stuff at me and the walls, she'd get angry at her daughter and leave me and her daughter at the house and drive off for about 10 minutes and come back.

But the one minute she'd be so amazing taking me places and have great sex, dancing in the kitchen etc, but in December last year we had a huge argument over money. We were both losing money my hours had been cut and she had fallen off a step ladder doing the Christmas lights on the front porch.

I'll never forget that day until I die, so we had argued the night beforehand about money, I went to bed and slept in her daughters bed. I woke up the next day and took a painkiller for my tooth, her daughter went to school etc with a family friend, next minute my ex starts being weird saying I'm too much and I need to go home, so I questioned why I'm too much.

Then she gets all angry and throws her mug of coffee at the wall and it breaks and goes all over my Christmas presents, then she gets the handle as it's broken off and then cuts her palm with it and tells me to ""fuck off!'.


I go into the kitchen to make sure she's okay she pulls out a chefs knife from the block and tells me to back off, so I go back into the living room.


Next minute I see she has her phone on 999 I told her I was going to leave as she is being worse than normal, then she gets in my face and I push her, she falls and hits her face I didn't know how hard I'd pushed her.


She had hit her head on the side of the wooden side table and there was blood, she got up and told me to leave I was so upset that she'd pushed me to my limit.

She drove to her family's home, I got my stuff and left, shw told her family I was abusive I have never done this to her before and have always let her walk all over me.


She had me arrested well her family did for common assault as I pushed her and left bruises, she hasn't made a statement yes and I'm in bail until march 26.

I have a clean record, I'm known by many as a nice guy with a great heart, all my nephews and nieces love me and my dog too. 

She's made me out to be a monster after all the shit I dealt with, her trying to kill herself 2 times a saved her twice, her talking about her ex's all the time and how they all cheated on her.

She dropped my stuff off the other day but she said she was scared of me so it's all fucked my head up, she had childhood trauma being in the care system that's why she's angry all the time apparently.

I feel remorse pushing her, I did love her and she's been hit before from her ex husband he was suicidal because of her too, I think should of left her when I had the chance in march 2025, but I wanted to fix her.

Feel broken and so lonely and sad atm, I went through so much stuff many men would have left her, I tried to fix her she said she'd never been loved like I loved her.


I lost her and her daughter when we split, now her family hate me and so does she, but they don't know the whole story all the shit I put up with for months and did bite.

Be careful who you love, it's harder said then done, but love can make you feel amazing and then it all comes crashing down like Jenga.

I will miss the memories, I honestly hope she gets help as her daughter will see her mum go down hill fast.

I can't comment on my own post for some reason, so here's part 2 of my work thus far:

It seems like the install is broken, but I should have included that I installed TV via snap:

but for shiggles I'll reinstalledl it:



    $ sudo snap install tradingview

I'm still getting the same error.

I don't understand where this thing is being installed:

I decided to look for that x86\_64-linux-gnu directory



    
    looks like a few directories with that name exists:root@fedora:~# find / d -name ""x86_64-linux-gnu"" | grep snap > results.txt



    root@fedora:~# wc -l results.txt  
    20 results.txt



now to look for that dri directory:



    root@fedora:~# for line in $(cat results.txt); do ls -ld ""$line""
    /dri; done 2> /dev/null
    drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 315 Apr 11  2023 /var/lib/snapd/snap/gno

so, maybe I can just symlink back to one of these directories?  I'm not sure.  Need coffee.  I'll come back to this in a bit.",1,1767695539.0,TradingView,0,1.0,False

Then throughout the months she gets really angry throwing stuff at me and the walls, she'd get angry at her daughter and leave me and her daughter at the house and drive off for about 10 minutes and come back.

But the one minute she'd be so amazing taking me places and have great sex, dancing in the kitchen etc, but in December last year we had a huge argument over money. We were both losing money my hours had been cut and she had fallen off a step ladder doing the Christmas lights on the front porch.

I'll never forget that day until I die, so we had argued the night beforehand about money, I went to bed and slept in her daughters bed. I woke up the next day and took a painkiller for my tooth, her daughter went to school etc with a family friend, next minute my ex starts being weird saying I'm too much and I need to go home, so I questioned why I'm too much.

Then she gets all angry and throws her mug of coffee at the wall and it breaks and goes all over my Christmas presents, then she gets the handle as it's broken off and then cuts her palm with it and tells me to ""fuck off!'.


I go into the kitchen to make sure she's okay she pulls out a chefs knife from the block and tells me to back off, so I go back into the living room.


Next minute I see she has her phone on 999 I told her I was going to leave as she is being worse than normal, then she gets in my face and I push her, she falls and hits her face I didn't know how hard I'd pushed her.


She had hit her head on the side of the wooden side table and there was blood, she got up and told me to leave I was so upset that she'd pushed me to my limit.

She drove to her family's home, I got my stuff and left, shw told her family I was abusive I have never done this to her before and have always let her walk all over me.


She had me arrested well her family did for common assault as I pushed her and left bruises, she hasn't made a statement yes and I'm in bail until march 26.

I have a clean record, I'm known by many as a nice guy with a great heart, all my nephews and nieces love me and my dog too. 

She's made me out to be a monster after all the shit I dealt with, her trying to kill herself 2 times a saved her twice, her talking about her ex's all the time and how they all cheated on her.

She dropped my stuff off the other day but she said she was scared of me so it's all fucked my head up, she had childhood trauma being in the care system that's why she's angry all the time apparently.

I feel remorse pushing her, I did love her and she's been hit before from her ex husband he was suicidal because of her too, I think should of left her when I had the chance in march 2025, but I wanted to fix her.

Feel broken and so lonely and sad atm, I went through so much stuff many men would have left her, I tried to fix her she said she'd never been loved like I loved her.


I lost her and her daughter when we split, now her family hate me and so does she, but they don't know the whole story all the shit I put up with for months and did bite.

Be careful who you love, it's harder said then done, but love can make you feel amazing and then it all comes crashing down like Jenga.

I will miss the memories, I honestly hope she gets help as her daughter will see her mum go down hill fast.

Suddenly, using the same grind size I normally use for this type of coffee, the extraction takes much longer.
When I start the extraction, it takes about 20 seconds for the first drops to appear in the cup, and then 30+ seconds to pull the espresso shot.
I’ve cleaned the solenoid valve, descaled the machine, and done backflushing, but nothing has changed.
I’m also using filtered water, so scale buildup shouldn’t be an issue.
The water flow through the steam wand is good.

I attached the video of water flow without the portafilter so you guys can see if it is ok or not. ",1,1767695390.0,gaggiaclassic,8,1.0,False

Newly Single, and I honestly have no clue how to go about meeting a great match for myself.","I'll try not to make this crazy long, but with fairly decent detail. As I stated above, I just broke up with my GF of 16 months the other day, and I'm just feeling like I've fallen completely off the tracks in my love life 😕 I really did like this girl a lot, but I ultimately came to the conclusion that she just wasn't good for me. Not just her age as she was (22) but our personalities, interests, beliefs...nothing seemed right. No sexual chemistry either. It was interesting to say the least, which was crazy because we never had a fight. We had plenty of disagreements, but we never yelled at each other...which was about the only thing we had in common, lol. We were both not the kind of people that got mad and started yelling. Now, I know what some of you might be thinking...why I'd be dating someone that young? Well, because I have zero interest in dating single mom's. I'm sorry, but I went down that road just one time, and I'll never ever do it again. Now, I wasn't looking for women that young, but I was having such a hard time finding any women around my age that didn't have one or multiple children with one or multiple different other Men. I'm a very simple man, and that kind of drama is not for me. I got divorced at 27 and spent about 7 years single. Not intentionally, but it was just that difficult for me. I pretty much just used the dating apps. Tinder, Bumble, FB Dating. I even tried Match, which to my suprise I had the least amount of success on. Not many times, but on a rare occasion I tried making small talk with the cute girl at the local supermarket, or just anywhere really...but it never worked well. As a matter of fact, I have never in my life gotten a date by in person interactions 🫠 Maybe it works for some, but I just get the feeling we live in a time where it's not something that's viewed as appropriate as it once was? I don't know, but there once was a time were social interactions was a must to meet anyone, lol. Anyway, so here I am almost a middle aged guy, with no children of my own yet and I'm sitting here thinking to myself how the world am I gonna find a women that really clicks with me? I've never had that before. My first wife was a horrible match for me. I was 19 at the time when I met her, and I think about the only thing that drew me to her was that she was a goth metalhead, lol. Still to this day, I have a thing for those goth girls 😅 It's the style 😎 Anyway, I was 19 and a drummer in a metal band and that's basically how we met. She sent me a message on MySpace that she saw me playing drums, and thought I was hot. Other than that, she was a terrible person and I was too naive to see that, and I decided it was great idea to get married and waste 8 years of my life. Not good. Boy things are different now. I'm not 19 anymore in my z28 with that 6 Speed Hurst, long tube headers dual exhaust with my long flowing hair 🙂‍↕️ I started thinning pretty bad in my late 20s and decided to shave my head entirely in my early 30s, but thankfully I can grow a great beard, which I keep trimmed short. I'm trying to think what else...hmmm, well I really just like keeping it simple these days. I don't really drink much, and I never did nor do I smoke or do drugs. I was raised Christian and most of my family is, but about 4 years ago I had a Christian mental breakdown and revoked my faith entirely. I'm Agnostic these days, and would rather just stay as neutral as possible. Religion just gives me the spins and I'll get anxiety and pass out. So yeah, I'm basically a pretty simple white guy, who likes NFL football, card shows, good food, concerts, shooting guns at the range, staying home and binge watching tv show or movies. Love the Harry Potter movies! LOTR is also great too 👍 I play Drums still, but not professionally. I also play electric guitar, but also not professionally...at best I'm alright lol. I own my house completely paid off in a middle class white suburban neighborhood. I still have most of the same friends from HS. Some moved away, but I try to stay in touch. What can I say...maybe I'm not that interesting? I use to think I was cool playing drums on stage, and play in paintball tournaments. Now I mow and fertilize my lawn like Hank Hill...""Boy I'll tell you hwat."" I was almost an Eagle Scout, and set a record at Scioto Hills back in 04' where I got 13 merit badges in one weekend! I don't know if they even do Boy Scout stuff there anymore. I feel like I'm rambling on, but I had a couple cups of coffee sitting here just chillin watching Stanger Things with my mind just wondering off lol. So yeah, I'm pretty much just lost into what I can do to find that special someone...cause I didn't exactly work my butt off to financially put myself in a position where I can say I could have a family of my own, and not have to financially suffer. Ohhh yeah...I forgot to mention I don't work a regular job anymore. Well, sometimes I do but it's optional and I haven't done it as much, but I'm a registered Stage Hand with my local Union. I've set up dozens of stages for all kinds of big concerts. Recently I had a company I sold off a while back and now I just DoorDash full time because I enjoy making my own schedule. If I wanna make 2k a week, I can. If I wanna make $500 a week, so be it. I bought 2 cars, so I could do so reliably, which I own both...no loans. That's just where I am right now. I'm a free spirit just living day to day. I know women my age probably think less of me not having a ""real job or career"" but that's not what's important to me. I have time to figure it out, and I can afford too. I just want a real connection with a women. Something I've never had before, but always dreamed of having. I don't know if it matters, probably does because I have my type as well. I'm 5""8 140lb bald, beard, brown eyes, kind of handsome maybe. I'd give myself a 6.7 😏 See what I did there? 67! Lol I sure don't look 36, more like 30 maybe 31, I don't know lol. I love to wear black and white clothes, fitted nicely and my chuck Taylor's 🫡 Gotta love the classics! I haven't got any tattoos or piercings. Never cared for it, but it was probably my Christian Republican upbringing, yikes! Anywho...I'm definitely gonna head off to bed now, and if any cute girls so happen to read this and think...""Man, I like the cut of this guy's jib!"" Maybe we could go out for coffee ☕️ and a movie sometime? I hear they're bringing Lord of Rings back in theaters this month! I'm pretty excited, but that's just me nerding out 🤓 Alrighty then...Goodnight y'all. Sorry that was long, and hope to hear some advice!
