Last night I was up way later than I intended to working on an essay due tonight. I tried to call out of work just for today because I am overwhelmed with assignments and an exam as well, but my manager told me no because there was no one to cover me. My shift today was 10 am to 4 pm so I figured whatever I‚Äôll go. I was super tired and my manager even let me run to the local store to grab a coffee. After doing this he told me its a bad look to be so tired in front if the customers and sent me home. Because i could really use these hours I asked if I could get a second chance and he said sure come back in at 4 because another person called out sick(probably until closing at 9) so I was grateful. I went home drank a ton of caffeine and worked on some school work. When i went in at 4 I felt much more awake, handled customers with ease and got all the other tasks I needed handled, so I started fixing some signs on our display foods. This is when he tapped me on the shoulder at around 6:10 and told me that one of the owners that watches the cameras said I seemed tired and sent me home AGAIN. Basically all day there was no one working the counter besides the few hours I was there. I was not tired and had done plenty of work even getting compliments from customers. This whole day that i tried calling out of I could have been working on school but instead was treated like this and sent home both times. Im not sure what to make of this especially because i know for a fact i was perfectly fine the second time. Any advice or opinions on this situation would be appreciated thank you for reading. (Kinda worried they want me to quit despite the fact that I trained all of the new hires and this job for the most part works perfectly with my school schedule besides today).",1,1759205205.0,JobAdviceforall,0,1.0,False

We know each other pretty well, but he always lies, exaggerates, and makes up stories about insignificant things as if I‚Äôm his friend because he does/knows about those ‚Äúcool‚Äù things.

For example, we‚Äôll be talking about what kind of drink we get at a coffee shop, he‚Äôll say he loves the really sweet ones and he always gets them with extra sugar, even though we always go to these shops, and I know he always gets unsweetened. Then two weeks later he‚Äôll go back to saying the unsweetened is better, etc. 

Another example is when we‚Äôre talking to someone we don‚Äôt know as well, and he‚Äôll make up some over-exaggerated story about a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù, except that I do know that friend, but he just changes the name. 

Our friend group has started to catch on (I caught on a while ago) and it‚Äôs getting kind of awkward whenever we‚Äôre with him, since all the things he says to us contradict one another. I‚Äôm not his friend because I think he is super cool and has great stories and all that, I‚Äôm his friend because I enjoy being around him.

We sat in the motel room. I was nursing my drink and Gus was helping himself to a cup of instant coffee. 
    ‚ÄúSo, what exactly are you going to do?‚Äù I asked. 
   He took a sip from his cup and cleared his throat.
‚ÄúThe killings appear to be spontaneous, that is, until you look a little closer,‚Äù he said before pulling out a notebook from his backpack. He shuffled through the pages of the notebook and showed me a page that was somewhere in the middle. 
A crudely glued on map of the town was covered in pen markings. 
   ‚ÄúAll of the locations have been at places where there‚Äôs nobody around,‚Äù he said. 
   ‚ÄúAt most there‚Äôll be three people, but it‚Äôs never in a heavily populated area,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúWell, as heavily populated a town like Wayfield can be,‚Äù he chuckled. 
   ‚ÄúHow many people have been found dead?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúAbout thirteen,‚Äù he replied. 
   My mouth was open as I stared at him in shock. 
   ‚ÄúThirteen?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs including the three victims from tonight,‚Äù he said. 
    He closed his notebook and put it back into his backpack. 
   ‚ÄúWe need to act fast, the behavior is changing and it‚Äôs not for the better,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù I asked with a raised eyebrow. 
   ‚ÄúTake the killing of the lobby boy. He was maybe a hundred feet away from a diner. The church on the other side of town is not too far away from the town's Walmart,‚Äù Gus said. 
   ‚ÄúWhat does that mean exactly?‚Äù I asked. 
He chugged down his instant coffee and looked like he was about to gag for a moment. 
   ‚ÄúThat means, it‚Äôs getting comfortable with being near more people. I‚Äôd say we have only a matter of time before he starts going after large crowds,‚Äù he explained. 
   ‚ÄúWhat do you plan on doing?‚Äù I asked sheepishly. 
   He threw out the paper coffee cup and looked out the motel window. 
‚ÄúWe have to kill a werewolf tomorrow night,‚Äù he proclaimed. 
   ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you mean we?‚Äù I sneered. 
He turned around and faced me. 
‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôre a journalist? Well, isn‚Äôt this a story that someone like you would kill for?‚Äù He asked. 
   ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, this is kind of out of my comfort zone,‚Äù I said. 
    He nodded his head and rubbed his chin. 
‚ÄúI see,‚Äù he said. 
   ‚ÄúDid you go to school to be a journalist?‚Äù He asked.
‚ÄúI did but I don‚Äôt really see what this has to do with anything,‚Äù I said. 
   ‚ÄúWell, when you were in school. Did you fantasize about being the journalist who went on the cutting edge? The reporter who looked death in its eyes and wrote a story on it? Or did you go to school to talk about shitty diner food in small towns?‚Äù He asked. 
   ‚ÄúI thought the diner's food was rather pleasant,‚Äù I said. 
He glared at me and extended his hand as a handshake. 
‚ÄúThis is a one-time deal. Are you a real journalist or are you a fluff writer?‚Äù He asked. 
I stood up and walked towards him. 
  ‚ÄúYou have a way with words,‚Äù I said before shaking his hand. 
‚ÄúExcellent,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThen tomorrow night, we kill a werewolf,‚Äù he added before leaving and walking into the night. 
‚Äî‚Äî-9
‚ÄúI‚Äôd have to say that this is by far the most‚Ä¶interesting assessment you‚Äôve put me on,‚Äù I said into the phone. 
   There was silence for a moment. 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean by that?‚Äù He asked. 
   I stared out the window and saw the morning sun shining down on the motel parking lot. 
     ‚ÄúThere have been several developments that have occurred and I haven‚Äôt even been here a full day so far,‚Äù I said. 
   ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶hopefully. Send me some of your notes when you get a chance,‚Äù he said.
   I saw outside that a big black van had rolled up into the parking lot of the motel.
   ‚ÄúI certainly will sir,‚Äù I said before hanging up. 
I quickly put on my shoes and grabbed my keys and wallet. 
If something was going down, I didn‚Äôt want to be a part of it. 
   I made sure my door was locked and I started walking towards my car. The black vans engine wasn‚Äôt running and my fight or fight was starting to kick in. 
  I reached my car and started fumbling with the keys until the van door opened. 
I looked over and saw Gus VonHammer getting out. 
  ‚ÄúWhere are you going this fine morning?‚Äù He asked. 
   My heart started to slow down. 
   ‚ÄúI just kind of figured I‚Äôd get something for breakfast,‚Äù I said. 
   ‚ÄúI have protein bars in my van. We don‚Äôt have time for breakfast,‚Äù he said before waving at me to come over. 
   ‚ÄúWhere are we going exactly?‚Äù I asked as I walked over to him. 
  Gus got back into the driver's seat and I opened the passenger side door. 
A slew of empty soda bottles and meat stick wrappers lay in the seat before Gus had quickly swept them to the floor. 
   ‚ÄúWe need to get supplies and then we need to cover our ground,‚Äù he said while starting the van's engine. 
I looked behind me and saw the back of the van, it was surrounded by tote boxes, all of them marked with a small description. 
In the middle of the van's floor was a yellow-stained mattress with a sad blanket and a limp pillow. 
  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also planning on trying to get some information from the locals. We need to find out what places these people tend to congregate at during the evenings,‚Äù he said. 
	‚ÄúTipping cows, I would imagine,‚Äù I said sarcastically. 
	Gus scoffed at me and rolled his eyes. 
‚ÄúThis is a serious matter, Conner,‚Äù he said while pulling out of the motel parking lot.  
	‚ÄúThere is a bloodthirsty killer on the loose, and if we don‚Äôt act fast, more innocent blood will be spilled,‚Äù he proclaimed. 
As we were driving down the road, it dawned on me that a stranger got me into his van with the promise of candy. I bet Mom would be so proud of me right now. 
	As I was finishing up the protein bar the Gus had given me, we pulled into the Walmart parking lot. 
	‚ÄúSo, what supplies are we getting exactly?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúWe need to get bait,‚Äù Gus said as he unbuckled himself. 
	‚ÄúSince this specific American lycanthrope has gotten a taste for human flesh, we can‚Äôt use beef like I would normally use,‚Äù he said while getting out of the driver's side. 
I got out and started following behind him, 
‚ÄúWe need to go with pork. It has a texture that tastes similar to human flesh and that might just be enough to help attract it,‚Äù he explained. 
The parking lot was almost crammed to the brim. A slew of shoppers were entering and leaving, they looked like ants around an ant hill.
‚ÄúIs it usually this busy here?‚Äù I asked. 
  Gus stopped for a second and looked at me. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve only been here for a week, how would I know?‚Äù He asked. 
  I shrugged my shoulders, ‚ÄúIt was really more of a rhetorical question,‚Äù I said.
   We entered the mouth of the Walmart and Gus grabbed a cart.
It was at that moment that I noticed that Gus VonHammer was wearing cargo shorts and a trenchcoat together, the man truly is a fashion icon. 
Families were all around us, they seemed alert and on edge. They seemed itching to start a fight no matter how small it might be. 
   ‚ÄúPork steaks are going to be what we aim for but pork chops can be a decent substitute,‚Äù Gus said. 
  ‚ÄúOkay but, why exactly?‚Äù I asked. 
The wheels on the shopping cart wobbled back and forth like a top that had just been spun. 
‚ÄúPork steaks are bigger in length and fairly thin, that‚Äôll make it easier to attach,‚Äù he explained. 
  ‚ÄúHowever, with pork chops, we can poison them,‚Äù he added. 
 I looked around at the shopping carts going past us. They all seemed filled to the brim with cases of water, canned food, and what one might call home defense gear. 
	‚ÄúAre you going to fill them with silver?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúWhat? No! Silver is way more expensive than people realize,‚Äù he said. 
	It was at that moment that as Gus was facing me, he bumped into another shopping cart. 
Under a normal circumstance, this would be a situation where the two parties apologize and go on with their day. 
	However, we were rather far from normal circumstances. 
‚ÄúHey! What the fuck is your deal dickhead?‚Äù a towering man with a mullet and sideburns asked. 
‚ÄúI do apologize about that,‚Äù Gus said with a heavy dose of sincerity. 
	‚ÄúYou trying to size me up boy?‚Äù the man asked. 
He was wearing bright green crocs and an obnoxiously yellow pair of basketball shorts that paired rather well with his gangster Bugs Bunny smoking weed and holding a desert eagle t-shirt. 
‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm really not, it was just an accident,‚Äù Gus said. 
‚ÄúBaby, is everything okay?‚Äù a blonde woman asked as she ran up behind him. 
‚ÄúThis dickhead is trying to size me up,‚Äù he said. 
The woman was wearing a Cookie Monster shirt and a pair of hot pink booty shorts that had the words ‚ÄúEat it while it‚Äôs hot‚Äù over her crotch. 
It was at that moment that I started to wonder if I was overly dressed. 
‚ÄúI promise you, I am not trying to size you up,‚Äù Gus insisted. 
The man clenched his fist and I could see the vein popping in his forehead. 
	‚ÄúBaby, don‚Äôt do anything dumb,‚Äù the woman said with desperation in her eyes. 
Everyone around us had stopped shopping entirely, all of them glued to us like a child watching an ISIS beheading video. 
Gus raised his hands into the air. 
‚ÄúIf I was trying to size you up, why would I do it in a place this busy?‚Äù Gus asked. 
‚ÄúIf I tried to pick a fight with you, there's a high probability I would be getting my shit rocked by every man here with the exception of Conner,‚Äù Gus explained while pointing at me. 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bring me into this,‚Äù I whispered. 
The man said nothing for a moment while his partner caressed him. 
‚ÄúBaby, please don‚Äôt do this,‚Äù she begged him. 
The man pointed at Gus and I. 
	‚ÄúIf y‚Äôall try that shit again, I‚Äôm beating the fuck out of you,‚Äù he said.
It would be a cold day in Hell before I let a grown man wearing crocs in public beat me up but I stayed quiet. 
‚ÄúSounds like a plan,‚Äù Gus said before grabbing his shopping cart handle. 
The four of us began to walk away slowly while the two men kept their eyes locked.
‚ÄúAnyways, I was going to load the pork chops with rat poison and antifreeze,‚Äù Gus said nonchalantly. 
‚ÄúHowever, we‚Äôll be limited on how we can attach. They don‚Äôt bend that well,‚Äù he said. 
When we made it to the meat section, it had all been picked clean.
I looked over at Gus. 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan now?‚Äù I asked. 
Gus had a surprised look plastered on his face. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a werewolf, not a blizzard. Why is everyone panic buying?‚Äù He asked aloud. 
As a woman was walking past us, Gus raised up his hand as if he was asking a question. 
The woman had on big black over the ear headphones and was wearing jeans and a green ‚ÄúJesus loves you!‚Äù Shirt. 
Her shopping cart was filled with cases of water and canned food. 
‚ÄúHello, sorry to interrupt you ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Gus said. 
The woman stopped and took off her earphones. 
‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù She asked.
‚ÄúHello yes, so my associate and I aren‚Äôt from around this area, is there something going on?‚Äù He asked. 
She looked at Gus like he had grown another head. 
‚ÄúY‚Äôall really must not be from around here,‚Äù she said. 
‚ÄúA bunch of people have been found dead,‚Äù she said.
Gus nodded his head. 
‚ÄúOh I know, that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here,‚Äù he said.
The woman‚Äôs face got even more confused. 
‚ÄúWhy is everyone panic buying?‚Äù Gus asked. 
Still in a state of bewilderment the woman leaned closer to us. 
‚ÄúIf y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt from around here, I reckon y‚Äôall leave,‚Äù she said. 
‚ÄúAnd to answer your question: they are putting us on a curfew. Nobody can leave their house from sundown to sunrise,‚Äù she added. 
‚ÄúThank you ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Gus said before reaching into his pocket and grabbing a business card. 
He handed it to the woman and she looked at it for a solid thirty seconds before smiling and nodding. 
She didn‚Äôt bother putting her earphones back on as she began to quickly walk away. 
‚ÄúSo what do we do now?‚Äù I asked. 
He stood there for a second and pondered the question. 
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to have to pivot,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see,‚Äù he said before leaving his shopping cart and walking away. 


10

I have been complicit with many great ideas in my life, however, this was far from one of them. 
Gus had a boombox on his car's hood as he was shuffling through a binder full of CDs. 
‚ÄúSo what music does a werewolf enjoy?‚Äù I asked sarcastically.
‚ÄúThe music doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is if it‚Äôll be loud enough to draw it towards us,‚Äù he said as he flipped another page. 
‚ÄúWhy not put on wolf howls or something?‚Äù I asked while pulling a cigarette out. 
‚ÄúIf you heard a group of people talking, would you just walk up towards them?‚Äù He asked. 
‚ÄúProbably not,‚Äù I replied. 
‚ÄúWell the same thing applies for werewolves,‚Äù he said. 
He flipped one more page and tapped on a CD. 
‚ÄúThis is our bait,‚Äù he said before pulling the CD out of its sleeve and putting it into the boombox. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a three song EP so it‚Äôs not going to have a lot of variety,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúUh, okay‚Ä¶‚Äù I said unsure what reaction he was expecting. 
We were in a field in the middle of nowhere. Just out of county lines so that we wouldn‚Äôt be hounded by the police over breaking the curfew that was slowly approaching. 
Gus held the boombox in one hand and a cane in the other. 
‚ÄúWhy do you have a cane?‚Äù I asked. 
He scowled at me. 
‚ÄúNever ask someone why they have a cane, that‚Äôs incredibly rude,‚Äù he said. 
He walked towards the middle of the field and placed the boombox on the ground. 
The song started softly and pleasantly before turning into an incoherent mess. 
Gus walked back towards me, cane still in hand. 
‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúLorna Shore,‚Äù he said, making it sound like I was a dumbass for not knowing. 
‚ÄúYou guys really shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù a voice said from behind us.
I turned around expecting to see a cop but I instead was greeted by a malnourished man who was wearing nothing but a pair of black underwear. 
‚ÄúYou guys really need to leave right now,‚Äù he said.
He was shaking violently, his eyes were drowning in fear and a disgusting mop of hair sat atop his hair. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hurt you,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it to hurt you,‚Äù he said with tears forming in his eyes. 
‚ÄúGet in the car,‚Äù Gus said. 
‚ÄúYeah, we can get you to the hospital or something,‚Äù I said. 
Gus pointed at me. 
‚ÄúNo, you get in the car and start the engine,‚Äù he said before handing me his keys. 
I took them and walked to the driver's side. 
Gus began to talk to the man but I couldn‚Äôt hear them. 
The man was crying and Gus gave him a hug. 
They began walking towards the boombox. As the sun began to set on the horizon, the man got down on his knees and Gus put his hand on his shoulder. 
They stood like that in silence. 
Gus reached into his trenchcoat and pulled out a pistol. I pressed down on the horn hoping to warn the man but that was to no avail. 
Gus looked at me and a heaviness rested in his eyes. 
I got out of the van and began charging him. 
How could I have been so fucking stupid? This was clearly a mentally disturbed man and I was falling for his delusional worldview. 
‚ÄúTurn around Conner,‚Äù Gus said. 
I leaped into the air and made contact with him. I held him by the waist and dragged him down to the floor. 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you?‚Äù I yelled at him. 
I pinned his arms down to the ground with my knees. 
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing!‚Äù He yelled at me. 
I made a fist and struck him in the nose. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let you kill an innocent man!‚Äù I yelled before sending another blow to his nose. 
Blood began to gush out of it and Gus was squirming around. If it hadn‚Äôt been for his size, I would have been able to keep him pinned to the ground. 
Yet I now found myself off of him. 
‚ÄúI understand this looks bad, but you have to trust me!‚Äù He yelled.
I scrambled upon my feet and began scanning around for the gun. However, it had gotten too dark to find. 
‚ÄúTrust you? Trust you!‚Äù I yelled. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to execute a random fucking dude!‚Äù I added. 
I looked over at the man that I had saved and saw him with his mouth wide open. 
Black bile began to flood out of his mouth as his eyes rolled to the back of his head. 
‚ÄúOh fuck,‚Äù I said. 
‚ÄúWe need to call an ambulance,‚Äù I said before reaching into my pocket. 
Gus grabbed his cane and began looking for his gun. 
The man began to shake violently back and forth before landing on his back. He flopped around like a fish out of water. 
Yet even though we had little light, I could see his face was wincing. However, it began to grow outwards. His eyes were closed and he sat on his knees again. He held his face with his hands and I saw that his fingernails had somehow grown at least three inches. 
More black bile came out of his face and onto his chest which was now covered in heavy black hair. His skin was growing more and more grey. 
‚ÄúConner,‚Äù Gus said, breaking me from the trance that I had been hypnotized into. 
I looked at him and he said one word: 
‚ÄúRun.‚Äù
The man let down his hands and his eyes were wide open. 
Now they were a deep yellow with his iris confronted. 
His face was no longer human, but now that of a wolfs.

  I had never ran so fast in my life. The mix of adrenaline and genuine terror was overflowing in me. My hands trembled as I flung the van door open. I looked up and saw Gus was in the passenger side. I put my hands on the steering wheel and threw the car in reverse. The newly transformed was in our headlights. It got on four legs and began running towards us. Even though we had a good ten second head start, it managed to jump onto the hood of the van. I heard two thuds under us, we had hit the road. I slammed on the breaks and it went flying into the air. It landed on its legs and let out a snarl. 
I spun the steering wheel and gunned it down the road. 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I yelled out. 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I yelled while looking at Gus. 
‚ÄúI said it was werewolf!‚Äù He yelled at me.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was a real fucking thing!‚Äù I yelled. 
‚ÄúIt ripped a guy's head off! What were you thinking it was?‚Äù He said gruffly. 
‚ÄúDid you think it was a metaphorical werewolf? Did you think it was a slang word for something?‚Äù He asked oozing sarcasm. 
I glanced at the side mirror and my stomach sank.
I saw a figure running behind us and he was gradually getting closer.
‚ÄúDid you expect it to be a serial killer who glues hair to his face?‚Äù He asked.
‚ÄúGus,‚Äù I said. 
‚ÄúThere were claw marks all over the place,‚Äù he said, continuing his tirade. 
‚ÄúGus,‚Äù I said, hoping to get his attention. 
‚ÄúHe was a guy in his underwear telling us he didn‚Äôt want to hurt us,‚Äù he said while ignoring my failed attempt to draw him. 
The werewolf‚Äôs face was illuminated by the taillights of the van. 
‚ÄúGus!‚Äù I yelled. 
‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù He yelled looking at me, a vein popping in his forehead. 
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right fucking behind us!‚Äù I said. 
As the words left my mouth, a thud was heard from the roof of the car.
We fell silent for the first time since we got in the van. 
Gus rolled down his window and looked outside before immediately getting his head back in. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a werewolf on the van,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúNo shit!‚Äù I yelled. 
A crunch came from the top of our heads. 
I looked up and saw that the roof of Gus‚Äôs van had been punctured by the claws of the beast. 
‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I asked. 
Gus was silent.
‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù I asked with more urgency in my voice. 
‚ÄúGive me a second, I‚Äôm trying to think!‚Äù He snapped.
‚ÄúTake a turn up here!‚Äù He said. 
I hooked a right and I could feel the van almost flip. 
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not do that,‚Äù I said. 
‚ÄúWe have to shake him off,‚Äù he said urgently. 
To my surprise, the turn we had made was into the humble Walmart parking lot that we had been to. 
I was getting closer and closer to the door when an idea struck me. 
I slammed my foot on the brakes and the tires squealed like a horde of hogs. 
The werewolf flew off the top of the van and crashed through the front doors of the Walmart. 
The glass doors exploded and sent shards of glass flying everywhere.
As soon as he hit the floor he rolled several times and laid down on the ground.
I took a deep and shaking breath. 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck,‚Äù I weezed out with my hands still glued to the steering wheel.
I looked over at Gus and took another deep breath. 
‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I yelled. 
Gus held up his hand. 
‚ÄúI understand, you have a lot of emotions going on right now. However, I would like you to please take a deep breath,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúDid you just tell me to take a deep breath?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúThat is a literal fucking werewolf over there!‚Äù I yelled. 
I pointed at the werewolf but when I looked over, I saw that it was gone.
I looked over at where Gus was sitting and he was already running into the Walmart. 
I unbuckled my seat and followed right behind him. 

12
I was only a few feet behind Gus as we charged into the Walmart. The bright fluorescent lights were oppressive with their glare. The tile was slick and Gus held his cane up as he ran. 
Gus froze and looked around for a second before booking looking at me. 
‚ÄúI need you to get a message over the intercom, we need to evacuate this place immediately,‚Äù he said. 
He bent down like he was about to tie his shoes but instead he pulled out a small thing that was hiding behind the fabric of his jeans. 
He handed over to me a pistol that I had only known as a stripper pistol.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need this,‚Äù he said. 
I grabbed it from and held it in my hand. 
He held my hand and moved it away from him. 
‚ÄúHave you held a gun before?‚Äù He asked with a scowl. 
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. 
   He looked like he had a lot to say but he sighed and looked me in the eyes.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt point guns at people,‚Äù he said before he began to run away. 
He was facing me as he ran away. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll teach you how to shoot later,‚Äù he said before running off into the store. 
I looked at the pistol for a moment and then looked up and began to jog over to the closest cashier I could. 
I saw a red-haired woman standing behind the counter. She was playing on her phone and she had a dead look in her eyes. 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam!‚Äù I yelled. 
She didn‚Äôt look up and I got closer. 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam!‚Äù I yelled out. 
She glanced up and looked at me for a moment before going back to her phone. 
I stood in front of her and had the pistol clutched in hand. 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam! You need to tell everyone to leave, this place isn‚Äôt safe,‚Äù I said. 
‚ÄúWe are closing soon,‚Äù she said, still scrolling on her phone.
‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with that, there is a werewolf in the store and everyone needs to leave right now,‚Äù I said, stressing every word. 
She turned off her phone and looked at me with her head tilted. 
‚ÄúI have two hours left on my shift, this is only going to keep me here longer,‚Äù she said. 
‚ÄúPeople are going to die!‚Äù I yelled. 
Screams could be heard from the distance as a howl was cried out. 
I looked at her and hoped for any reaction from her. 
She turned on her phone and went back to scrolling. 
I took a deep breath and bit my lip. I didn‚Äôt want to do this, but I had to.
I pointed the pistol at the woman and cleared my throat. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get on that intercom‚Ä¶or else,‚Äù I said. 
She looked at the pistol and looked at me with the dead look not leaving her face. 
She moved her head and placed her forehead right against the barrel of the pistol. 
‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôve been working here for ten years, death is better than night shift,‚Äù she said. 
My hand was trembling and I tried to keep a stoic face. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve also been robbed enough times to know that you don‚Äôt have the balls to pull that trigger,‚Äù she said. 
‚ÄúYou can prove me wrong if you like?‚Äù She said with her dry lifeless voice. 
I pointed the gun away from her. 
She got back onto her phone and went back to arranging brightly colored fruits.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave you alone if you-‚Äú before I could finish what I was saying she had the intercom phone in her hand as she dialed away. 
‚ÄúAttention Walmart shoppers, we are making a request that everyone leaves the store effective immediately. We will not be taking purchases at this moment but we will be happy to help you tomorrow morning,‚Äù she said before going back to her phone. 
I began to run away and tried to listen to where the screaming was coming from. It felt surreal to run around Walmart this late at night. 
If it wasn‚Äôt a life or death situation, I‚Äôd even dare call it fun. 
Gunshots began to ring out from the furthest corners of the store. 
I ran as fast as I could until I slipped and fell on the tile floor. 
I looked to see what I slipped on and I saw my shoes were covered in blood. 
A crimson pool was where I had been running . I got up and saw the blood had made a line that entered into the fitting room. 
I held my pistol in my hand, trying to remember how they would hold it in the movies. 
I slowly walked towards the fitting rooms as I followed the trail of blood. 
The trail ended at a door that was closed. 
I put my ear against it and could hear a heavy breathing coming from within. 
I knocked on the door but got no answer. 
I knocked again and heard a sob come from within. 
‚ÄúAre you okay in there?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúGo away,‚Äù a voice said. 
   ‚ÄúLook, I assume you‚Äôre hurt and I want you to know I‚Äôm not that‚Ä¶thing,‚Äù I said. 
There was a moment of silence before the door opened. 
The same man from earlier who almost fought Gus stood in the doorway. A long laseration went down his arm. 
He took a look at me and a grimace came over his face. 
‚ÄúAre you fuckers why this shits been happening?‚Äù He asked. 
‚ÄúI need you to trust me right now, it is definitely not because of me,‚Äù I said. 
The cut went from his elbow to his shoulder. 
I turned around and grabbed a shirt that had been thrown into a return pile. 
It was a hot pink t-shirt with a unicorn on it that said ‚ÄúLive life magically‚Äù. 
I tore it and made a tourniquet out of it. 
‚ÄúHave you called the police?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúI was about to ask you the same thing,‚Äù he replied. 
I pulled out my phone and dialed 9-1-1 before handing it to him. 
‚ÄúYou know this place better than me, you can explain more of where we are,‚Äù I said. 
He took the phone and began talking, his words left his mouth like a bullet train. 
I went over to the return section to see if I could find another shirt to tear off and make a bandage. 
I figured this would safest place to stay until help arrived. 
That was until I heard a growling coming from behind me. 
The werewolf was smelling the pool of blood that I had slipped in. 
My brain was no longer capable of thinking, a primal instinct began to override my body. 
I shut the door but stayed out front. 
He didn‚Äôt see me. 
I pointed the pistol at him and did what I thought was aiming. 
There was no sights on the pistol and my hand was trembling with a concoction of adrenaline and fear running through me. 
I pulled the trigger and a loud BANG went off. 
There was now a bullet hole in the white tile that was in front of the werewolf. 
It looked at me and blinked for a second before looking at the bullet hole and back to me. I pulled the trigger again but all I heard was clicking. 
I bolted in the opposite direction and ran as fast as my body would allow for me to go. 
Yet I heard it right behind me. I couldn‚Äôt afford to look behind but I knew he was getting closer and closer. 
‚ÄúGUS!‚Äù I yelled out. 
‚ÄúGUS!‚Äù I yelled out again. 
I didn‚Äôt hear anything except the running of the feet and the sound of corporate friendly pop music playing over the PA system. 
I ran passed section after section, trying to find anyway to get the beast off my tail. 
Yet I felt him getting closer.
I swear I could feel its breath on my neck.
My knee buckled and I fell to the ground once more. 
I turned around and tried to get up but it was too late. 
It was now on top of me smelling me. 
There was not an ounce of humanity left in him. His skin was a sickly grey and a long brown fur covered him. 
I cursed Hailey in that moment, if she hadn‚Äôt called out last second, I wouldn‚Äôt be here. 
Granted, what was even the point in trying to fight back? I wasn‚Äôt going to win and it‚Äôs not like life was going to get better for me. 
I was only going to delay the inevitable.
I closed my eyes and braced for the end. 
Until a slew of gun shots rang out like the sound Gabriel‚Äôs trumpet. 
I looked and saw Gus coming at me from the side. 
‚ÄúDid you really think we were done fighting wolf face?‚Äù He yelled before firing off three more shots. 
I watched as the bullets made impact with its flesh. Tearing into one side but not leaving the other. 
It got up and began to charge Gus who in turn let out two more shots and began to run away. 
I got off the ground and began to follow the two. 
I looked for anything I could use to arm myself and the best thing I saw was in the beer section. 
I grabbed a forty and smashed it against the floor. Beer and glass went everywhere and grabbed the neck of the bottle and followed the gunshots. 
My makeshift weapon was in my left hand as I ran into combat. I saw Gus swapping his magazines and firing a few more shots at the werewolf but it only barely slowed him down. I ran up behind the werewolf and crammed the broken bottle into his back. It howled and it dawned on me that much like the pistol, this was a one shot weapon and I had nothing else planned. 
I ran towards Gus and was right behind him with the werewolf on my tail for the fourth time that night. 
‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù I hollered towards him. 
‚ÄúI have only a few shots left and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be effective,‚Äù he yelled at me. 
We ran through more of the Walmart, a kaleidoscope of different colored chips were in the corner of my eye. 
Gus stopped running and I turned my head to see what he was doing. 
Shells went flying into the after each trigger pull, and the werewolf was stunned. 
Gus held his cane in both hands. 
I was about to see a man die tonight and I was going to follow suit. 
I owed it to see his final stand, his final huzzah. 
The werewolf shook its head and began to run towards Gus before jumping into the air. 
As he was in the air Gus pulled the top of his cane and a sword came out. In the same motion he dodged the werewolf mid air and pierced its flesh as it was flying over him. 
The werewolf hit the ground and while it was laying on the floor Gus pulled out the blade and dove it into the chest of the beast. 
A blood curdling howl was let out before it moaned and groaned. 
Slowly the werewolf began to look more like a human again. 
Its fur and claws retracted and its skin returned to a lifeless pale complexion.
Gus held him in his arms.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù the bleeding man said with tears in his eyes. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù Gus said.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to hurt anyone,‚Äù the bleeding man said. 
Gus held the man‚Äôs shoulder. 
‚ÄúI know, but it‚Äôs over. You can sleep now,‚Äù Gus said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù the bleeding man said. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you don‚Äôt have to worry anymore,‚Äù Gus said.
The man said nothing more but he held such sorrow. 
Silence bestowed us as his eyes closed on last time. 


13
It‚Äôs rather impressive what situations you can get out of with a surveillance system and a police force willing to perform a cover up. 
I don‚Äôt really recall much of what happened afterwards. As Gus was holding the bleeding man, a police officer charged me from behind and I hit my head against the tile. 
Everything went black or so I‚Äôve assumed. 
The moment my memory comes together is when I was on my phone with my editor. 
I told everything that happened and he didn‚Äôt believe me. I sent some photos and a rough draft of the story that was going to be run. 
He said it was something that was definitely going to sell. 
I asked if I could stay down south for a little longer, I told him I found a source that could easily get us some top stories. 
We argued for a little bit but he said I could stay as long as I was on my own dime. 
It worked for me since this was definitely a better situation than what I had up north.
I left my motel room and walked to the van. 
‚ÄúWhat do we have next?‚Äù I asked. 
Gus smiled and unlocked the vans doors. 
‚ÄúEver seen a ghost before?‚Äù He asked.

1 I stared out at the city skyline, a can of cheap beer in one band and a cigarette in the other. The sun was starting to set and for the first time in awhile, I felt like I could breathe. I still had no clue what I was going to do, my life at that moment was a train wreck but I felt that the fire had died down. Even if only for a breath. I had no place to stay anymore and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could ever trust anyone again. A stream of smoke blew out of my mouth; the melody of the city was a barrage of angry horn honking that would go on long into the night. My phone rang and I looked down to see who it was. ‚ÄúEditor Murphy,‚Äù the screen read. I answered the phone and took a sip of beer. ‚ÄúHello, boss,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHey, West, I know this is the last second but would you be willing to come to the office?‚Äù He asked. My stomach sank, with the way everything was going, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I got fired at this point. ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOh yeah, it‚Äôs just I have an assignment that Hailey had to drop out of. It‚Äôs a pretty big assignment and I figured it might be more up your alley anyway,‚Äù he said. I took a sip of beer. ‚ÄúWhen do you need me in the office?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúCome by first thing in the morning and we‚Äôll talk,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell that sounds good to me,‚Äù I said before hanging up on the phone.

‚Äî‚Äî-2

‚ÄúVirginia?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy took a sip of his black coffee. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a bit of a way away, but the company is willing to pay for your travel expenses,‚Äù he said. The dying light bulb in his office continued to flicker. Throughout my entire time working here, his lights were always like that. I looked at the smoke-stained wallpaper of his office. ‚ÄúWhat does the assignment entail?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy took another swig of black coffee and moved his seat closer to his desk. ‚ÄúThere is a town called Wayfield and they‚Äôve had a series of grisly murders occur,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some of the leaked photos online, and they are truly grotesque. I about damn near vomited when I first saw them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo like, do you want me to solve it or something?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt would be amazing if you did, but no, I just want you to go down and interview some of the people in the area. It‚Äôs a small town, and everyone seems to know everyone. It‚Äôll be a juicy story,‚Äù he said. I sat in silence for a moment, running through every situation in my head. ‚ÄúWhat time do I leave?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy let out a smile.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî3

I drove for five hours, and everything I still owned was packed in the duffle bag I had been using as a suitcase since high school. I pulled up to the smallest motel I had ever seen. It was painted a gross off-white color and had a giant neon sign in the front. When I say it was small, I don't think this place had more than six rooms on the entire property. I got out of my car and looked at the sludge-filled, man-made swamp that was likely once a pool, and I walked into the lobby. It was small and smelled like a cheap cleaning solution. I walked up to the front desk, where a long-haired guy was reading a magazine. I stood in front of the desk for a second or two, waiting for him to acknowledge me. Yet my attempt at subtlety was in vain. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said. He glared at me and put his magazine to the side. ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to check in. The Midnight Press booked a room for me. It should be under Conner West,‚Äù I said. He tapped away at a computer that was on the desk and clicked his mouse a few times. ‚ÄúYeah, so, like your room isn‚Äôt ready yet,‚Äù he said in the most disinterested voice I had ever heard. I wanted to be sarcastic, I wanted to ask why the hell it wasn‚Äôt ready yet. It wasn‚Äôt like this was a big luxury hotel, my car is the only one in the parking lot for fucks sake. I took a deep breath, I couldn‚Äôt burn any bridges yet. ‚ÄúDo you know when it should be ready?‚Äù I asked. The man shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, maybe like an hour or something?‚Äù he said. I inhaled deeply and tried to hide my frustration. ‚ÄúOkay, I am kind of hungry so I‚Äôll go grab a bite to eat and I‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said before going back to his magazine. I walked out the door of the lobby and sat on a bench they had out front. I pulled out the pack of cigarettes that I had been puffing on since I started driving down this way. I lit the third to last one up and I started smoking. I felt the summer wind blowing on my face, the sun was starting to set and I was starting to understand the appeal of a small town. I didn‚Äôt hear the barrage of horns and yelling; I listened to a welcoming silence. The sound of cicadas hummed in the distance and I heard a wolf let out a howl. I looked over across the street and I saw a place that just called itself ‚ÄúThe Diner‚Äù. I figured I still had time to kill, and eating something that wasn‚Äôt potato chips and energy drinks might do me some good. I put my cigarette butt in the ashtray, and I started walking over.
The smell of bacon and burnt toast greeted me as I walked in. It was around eight o'clock on a Tuesday night and it was about as dead as you expected. I walked up to the counter and took a seat on a barstool. I looked at the sticky laminated menu that was already there. I don‚Äôt think this thing has been updated since the 2000s. A woman walked up to me with a small notebook in hand. ‚ÄúKnow what you want hun?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have a burger and fries with a chocolate shake,‚Äù I answered. She scribbled on her paper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be out in just a moment,‚Äù she said. She left and my eyes began to wander around the diner. Black and white tiles covered the floors and the booths all had a fake red leather. There was a jukebox in the corner of the room that had an ‚ÄúOut of order‚Äù sign on it. I looked next to it and the only other patron in the restaurant was sitting in a booth in the far corner. From where I sat I could already see the trench coat and stained Final Fantasy t-shirt. ‚ÄúI got an hour,‚Äù I said to myself before getting up and walking over to him. He was a man that could be described as husky. He had a beard that was kept way cleaner than his greasy hair that was wild and unkempt. He had a black fedora sitting next to him on the table. ‚ÄúHey I don‚Äôt mean to bother you sir,‚Äù I said. The man looked up from his meal, which was three grilled cheese sandwiches and a plate of bacon. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm a reporter from out of town, would you be willing to participate in an interview?‚Äù I added. The man finished chewing and took a sip of his drink. ‚ÄúSure, I could use the company!‚Äù He said joyfully. I sat down in front of him. ‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôre here for the murders?‚Äù He asked before taking a massive bite out of his grilled cheese. ‚ÄúYes actually,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù I said. He took a moment to respond while taking a sip from his straw. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not really a whole heck of a lot that happens around these parts. The police have tried to keep things quiet but that went out the door almost immediately,‚Äù he said. I pulled out my phone and started taking notes. ‚ÄúSo, did you know any of the victims?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo sir I did not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually from out of town,‚Äù he said before taking a bite of a piece of bacon. My face grew puzzled and I tiled my head. ‚ÄúOh, so what brings you to town then?‚Äù I asked. He ate another bite of bacon. ‚ÄúThe murders,‚Äù he said.

‚Äî‚Äî-4

The waitress brought over my food around the same time the man finished his second grilled cheese. ‚ÄúSo are you an investigator, journalist, or‚Ä¶‚Äù I said very confused. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm here for an alternative reason,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDark tourism?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He said with a face as confused as mine. ‚ÄúDark tourism, it‚Äôs when people go to check out really dark and disturbing things for a vacation,‚Äù I answered. He shook his head before taking a sip. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm here because someone hired me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, you are an investigator?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said before reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a business card and handed it to me. In big white letters on a black card it read: ‚ÄúDiscount Vampire Hunter‚Äù and under that in smaller letters was the name Gus VonHammer and his phone number next to that. I was starting to think I was being fucked with. ‚ÄúWell Mr. VonHammer, do you think it‚Äôs a vampire doing all of this?‚Äù I asked, trying to hold back every ounce of sarcasm in my voice. He let out a chuckle and shook his head. ‚ÄúNo no no, it‚Äôs obviously not a vampire,‚Äù he said. My eyebrow raised as I took a bite of my burger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a werewolf,‚Äù he said. I snorted right in front of him. ‚ÄúIs something funny?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúA werewolf?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYes, a werewolf,‚Äù he said with the seriousness of a doctor telling his patient the tests came back positive. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense, there‚Äôs been a string of murders and it‚Äôs not even a full moon,‚Äù I said, deciding to play along with the delusions this man was clearly encapsulated in. ‚ÄúOnly European werewolves do a monthly transformation,‚Äù he said. I took a bite of my fries. ‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù I asked while wondered if this was how Art Bell felt every time he was on air. ‚ÄúYes, North American werewolves transform nightly and are typically drifters in the day time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWow, I never knew that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe thing is, they mostly go after cattle, deer, and other similar animals. It‚Äôs rather unusual that they go after humans,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúSo, when you find this werewolf, are you going to shoot it with a silver bullet?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúKind of,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKind of?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shoot it with a hollow point forty-five and then while it‚Äôs down I‚Äôm going to cover it with gasoline and burn the body,‚Äù he said. I was happy to see that even small towns had crazy people. However, I was deeply disturbed by the fact that this man might kill a random person and claim he was a werewolf. I finished my milkshake and asked for a check. ‚ÄúKeep my business card,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you see anything out of the ordinary just let me know,‚Äù he said. I smiled and nodded my head as I placed a twenty-dollar bill on the table. ‚ÄúYou bet buddy,‚Äù I said, trying to leave as soon as possible. I left the diner and started walking over to the motel. If my room wasn‚Äôt ready it was going to take a lot to not throw a fit. I marched over and thought about what type of life Mr. VonHammer lived. He couldn‚Äôt have had a lot of family or friends close to him, because who the hell would let someone live in such delusion? As I was walking towards the motel lobby, something felt off. I shrugged it off as being creeped out by the guy I just spent the last hour talking to. When I got to the front door, it was broken off of its hinges. I walked past the broken door and my heart dropped. Blood was splattered all over the lobby. Viscera and bone fragments littered the linoleum floor like daisies in a meadow. What was left of the front desk clerk's head was sitting on the desk, his magazine soaking in blood. Torn limbs were scattered and a broken window led out to the night. A scream erupted out of me and I bolted out.

‚Äî‚Äî5 The blanket sat on my shoulders and a cup of coffee was in my hands. ‚ÄúI really wish you got introduced to our town in a better way,‚Äù Sheriff O‚ÄôNeil said. I said nothing as the shock was still processing itself out of my system. ‚ÄúWe have a peanut festival in March, it‚Äôs a really big thing‚Ä¶well big for us,‚Äù he said. The flashing lights of the ambulance coated us, the sirens had been cut once they got into the parking lot. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame really, he was a good kid,‚Äù the Sheriff said. ‚ÄúDo you need me to give a statement?‚Äù I mustered up. He stood awkwardly for a second and scratched his face. ‚ÄúLook, this ain‚Äôt really a big town, we know you had no involvement in any of this,‚Äù he said. Even in my recovering state of shock, alarm bells began to go off in my head. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked. The sheriff took his glasses off and leaned in towards me. ‚ÄúLook, it was probably a suicide, the guy was miserable and this just looked like a suicide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe was fucking decapitated and dismembered,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWatch your tone boy,‚Äù the sheriff said. ‚ÄúWatch my tone? Watch my fucking tone?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúUnless that guy threw himself in a wood chipper, I don‚Äôt see that being a suicide,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWatch your tone with me boy,‚Äù he said as his hand was slowly moving towards his pistol. I took a deep sigh. ‚ÄúIs there a place I can stay for the night?‚Äù I asked about choosing my life over questions. ‚ÄùWe contacted Gary; he should be here in a few minutes,‚Äù he said. I took a sip of my coffee and nodded my head. The sheriff no longer had his hand on his pistol. ‚ÄúHas this happened before?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI can't disclose that information,‚Äù he said. A deputy came up to the sheriff with a worried look on his face. ‚ÄúSir, I need to talk to you,‚Äù he said. Sheriff O‚ÄôNeil gave a thumbs up and looked at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back in a few minutes,‚Äù the Sheriff said to me. He walked away and I sat in silence as I sipped my coffee. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the business card I had received. ‚ÄúWas he right?‚Äù I thought to myself. The officer's speed walked past me, the sheriff pointed at me. ‚ÄúStay out of trouble,‚Äù he said to me. The two got into a cop car and turned the sirens on immediately. Before I could blink they darted into the night.

Gary was the owner of the town motel. Although he tried to maintain as much of a professional presence as possible, he was clearly disturbed by everything that had transpired. ‚ÄúI can assure you, this isn‚Äôt a normal situation here,‚Äù he said. He was a short fat Italian man who was balding at the top of his head. ‚ÄúI do apologize that your stay this far has been delayed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI understand, things happen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true‚Ä¶that‚Äôs mostly true,‚Äù he said as he pulled out the keys to my room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go ahead and comp this room for you and tell you what, you can have anything you want in the mini fridge,‚Äù he said to me. I held my duffle bag around my shoulder and walked inside the room. It was a rather unremarkable place, a tv that looked straight out of the 90s sat on a dresser that looked straight out of the 70s. The walls were covered with a wallpaper that had a variety of flowers on it and a painting of the ocean rested above the single bed. ‚ÄúAm I allowed to ask you a question?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOf course sir!‚Äù Gary said with a slight head nod. ‚ÄúThe kid who worked at the front desk, were you close to him?‚Äù I asked. He stood stiffly and rubbed his head. ‚ÄúI mean, we were about as close as a front desk worker and his manager could be. I didn‚Äôt really know him personally,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs fair,‚Äù I said before putting my bag on the bed. ‚ÄúDo you know if he was dealing with any mental health issues?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre a rather interesting character,‚Äù Gary said with a confused face. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard,‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm allowed to give out information like that,‚Äù he said. I raised my hands up and shook my head. ‚ÄúAnd I fully respect that,‚Äù I said. I bit my lip for a moment and lowered my hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the police are saying that, he passed because of a suicide,‚Äù I said. Gary took a deep breath as a look of grimace overwhelmed his face. ‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience that this night has caused you. I will not be answering any questions regarding my employees mental wellbeing. I wish you a good evening and a pleasant stay,‚Äù he said before handing me over the hotel key and walking off into the night.

What they never tell you about seeing a graphic crime scene, is you can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. The T.V was tuned to something stupid as the scene of the lobby played in my head on repeat. I looked at the alarm clock and saw it was after two. I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and looked at the heavy bags that were under my eyes. I walked to the mini fridge and looked at the inside. I grabbed two airplane bottles of Jack and a can of Coke. The night wasn‚Äôt going to go any faster if I was buzzed or sober. The cracks of the airplane bottles made me salivate as I poured my drink. I opened the curtains and sat in the chair that was right next to the window. The horror dawned on me that I very well might have been the last person that kid interacted with. Thoughts began to run through my head, speculations of a person I had only interacted with for less than five minutes. Then I saw a flashlight walking towards the lobby. I closed the curtains and put my shoes on. I looked for anything to arm myself with, the best I could do was a lighter and a can of complimentary hairspray. I peaked out the window and saw that the flashlight was now inside the lobby. Either the purest ambition of journalistic integrity overcame me, or the stupidest impulse override my senses, but either way, I was outside and walking towards the lobby. I was crouching in the parking lot, trying to make myself as small as possible. I got to the window of the lobby and I peered through. A figure was looking at the crime scene, they were hunched over a bloodstain and were taking a photo of the things around them. I slowly began to start walking away and towards my room. The game plan was still developing in my head. I was going to lock myself in my room and call the police. If anyone who wasn‚Äôt a cop came by, I was going to use my crude flamethrower to distract them as I ran to my car. ‚ÄúA bit late for a stroll isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù A voice said from behind me. I turned around and held the lighter and hairspray up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any trouble,‚Äù I said with a quiver of fear in my voice. I could only see the silhouette of the figure standing in front of me. The bright light of the street lamp radiated a dim gross orange. ‚ÄúI never assumed you did,‚Äù he said as he got closer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see you again, I will say I wish it was under better conditions,‚Äù the silhouette said. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWell, you should still have my business card,‚Äù he said before stepping close enough to where I could see his face. ‚ÄúWhy the hell are you here?‚Äù I asked. He let out a chuckle. ‚ÄúSimple, I‚Äôm being paid to investigate and kill the werewolf that‚Äôs in town and this was the second most recent werewolf attack,‚Äù Gus VonHammer said. ‚ÄúAre you still going on about this werewolf shit?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAlso what the fuck do you mean second most recent?‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúWhat do you suppose it was then? A gust of wind?‚Äù Gus said sarcastically. I was baffled by such a statement. ‚ÄúWhat? No this has to be a serial killer or something,‚Äù I said. He nodded his head in silence for a second. ‚ÄúSo, a person broke down the doors of a motel lobby and violently dismembered one of its employees before jumping through the window and then went to the local baptist church where they did the exact same crime to two teenagers who were in a car together?‚Äù He asked with a smug look on his face. ‚ÄúW‚Ä¶what,‚Äù was all I was able to muster up. ‚ÄúListen, I know it‚Äôs hard to believe, I know it sounds batshit insane. However, you have to believe me when I say that a werewolf is on the loose,‚Äù he explained. There was a silence that lingered between us. ‚ÄúI need a fucking cigarette,‚Äú I said.",1,1759205029.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

I am a freshman in college, and I definitely want to experience dating, but I don't want to make any mistakes. 
Anywho, background. Last month, I got dragged to my first party by my friend and it was honestly really fun, but when we first walked in, there was this guy standing alone, and he was just‚Ä¶ beautiful? I don't know, but he took up my mind the whole night, and I was freaking out to my friend about him, who was telling me to talk to him.. Well, we ended up near each other for the majority of the party, and I managed to squeak out a compliment about his outfit and then nothing else for the entire night‚Ä¶. I regret that so much, and I fumbled SO BAD. 	
Now fast forward to last week, I went to a school event with some friends because I actually made some (finally), and I just felt so happy, like I was in a crowded building with people I didn't know, and I just felt happy, like I was supposed to be there, which is a first. I honestly was stupidly hoping the guy from the party would be there, even though I didn't even know if he went to my school or anything, but then there he was, standing alone like the last time I saw him. 	
This time I had the guts to strike up a conversation, and he remembered me!!!! We talked the whole night, even after my friends left, we just hung out and talked the whole time. It was great. He complemented me a lot, and I obviously did the same to him. But sadly, I have been informed that I cannot flirt at all. Apparently, telling him he's super cool, apologizing for talking too much, stuttering, giggling, and fumbling over compliments (example: he told me i looked good in my outfit, i said he looked good all the time. Yes, i hit myself for that later, especially because i STUTTERED) is not good flirting and i dont know what to do. I don't know what im doing.
 I got his Instagram and we talk, but only if I text him first, im starting to think he doesn't like me and was just being nice, but all my friends usually call me stupid when I say that. I really like him, but maybe I came on too strong, and im super embarrassed, so he was just being nice. So I asked him to coffee, he was busy but apologetic about it, and asked if we could go the day after. Our schedules didn't line up, so he asked me if we could just go to dinner. I said yes. But dinner is so much more ‚Äòdate‚Äô than coffee, and im very scared. 
What do I do? How do I flirt? How do I make him like me? How do I know if he likes me? What am I supposed to say and do? Im very scared, this is my first date, im sorry for rambling so much. Thank you for reading.

Not usually one to put myself out there, but I figure something's gotta give, eventually. Please have a read and see if any/all of this resonates with you. I suck at typing in paragraphs, and will probably ramble anyway, so here's me, in dot-points:

* 31 year old male, 5'8"", black hair, brown eyes, happy to exchange a pic of myself ... !
* Working in IT for the last few years, though I have two degrees which I didn't use (one science and engineering)
* I consider myself to be empathetic, caring, down to earth, warm, honest, and emotionally available.
* I drink tea before coffee first thing in the morning. My tea is black with milk and sugar, but my 830am coffee is always a flat white.
* Recently getting back into the gym, I go 3-4x a week, working on cutting my 5km time down, and a two plate bench within the next 12 months.
* I take care of my health, eat right, lots of fruit and veg, get enough sunshine, sleep, and water... I hope you do too =)
* I have a solid relationship with my family, I consider them to be the rock in my life.
* Love my house music, all edm, all music in general tbh, and photography, I shoot film, got into it during COVID. Hit me up with your last.fm ! 
* I guess this isn't so relevant, but never been in a proper relationship ever at all before, but it is what it is. 
* I play guitar (though I don't practice nearly often as I should), and the book I am currently reading is 'Siddhartha' by Herman Hesse.
* I am a pretty damn good cook if I do say so myself. I am an expert at making a meal out of random stuff that's in the fridge, because I haven't gone shopping in the last week.

You are:

* In that 25 - 35 age bracket, please.
* A happy, carefree, authentic, down to earth person. Enjoys living life, rolling with the punches, sees the bright side in all situations, and has an appreciation for art/science/music/technology.
* It'd be nice if you were from the east coast :)
* Doesn't sweat the small stuff.
* Vibes with what I've written so far, willing to wake up to a good morning text each and every day, doesn't mind my incessant talking.

Anyway, that's probably enough rambling. I'd love to meet you if you're out there !

1 I stared out at the city skyline, a can of cheap beer in one band and a cigarette in the other. The sun was starting to set and for the first time in awhile, I felt like I could breathe. I still had no clue what I was going to do, my life at that moment was a train wreck but I felt that the fire had died down. Even if only for a breath. I had no place to stay anymore and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could ever trust anyone again. A stream of smoke blew out of my mouth; the melody of the city was a barrage of angry horn honking that would go on long into the night. My phone rang and I looked down to see who it was. ‚ÄúEditor Murphy,‚Äù the screen read. I answered the phone and took a sip of beer. ‚ÄúHello, boss,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHey, West, I know this is the last second but would you be willing to come to the office?‚Äù He asked. My stomach sank, with the way everything was going, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I got fired at this point. ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOh yeah, it‚Äôs just I have an assignment that Hailey had to drop out of. It‚Äôs a pretty big assignment and I figured it might be more up your alley anyway,‚Äù he said. I took a sip of beer. ‚ÄúWhen do you need me in the office?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúCome by first thing in the morning and we‚Äôll talk,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell that sounds good to me,‚Äù I said before hanging up on the phone.

‚Äî‚Äî-2

‚ÄúVirginia?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy took a sip of his black coffee. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a bit of a way away, but the company is willing to pay for your travel expenses,‚Äù he said. The dying light bulb in his office continued to flicker. Throughout my entire time working here, his lights were always like that. I looked at the smoke-stained wallpaper of his office. ‚ÄúWhat does the assignment entail?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy took another swig of black coffee and moved his seat closer to his desk. ‚ÄúThere is a town called Wayfield and they‚Äôve had a series of grisly murders occur,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some of the leaked photos online, and they are truly grotesque. I about damn near vomited when I first saw them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo like, do you want me to solve it or something?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt would be amazing if you did, but no, I just want you to go down and interview some of the people in the area. It‚Äôs a small town, and everyone seems to know everyone. It‚Äôll be a juicy story,‚Äù he said. I sat in silence for a moment, running through every situation in my head. ‚ÄúWhat time do I leave?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy let out a smile.

I drove for five hours, and everything I still owned was packed in the duffle bag I had been using as a suitcase since high school. I pulled up to the smallest motel I had ever seen. It was painted a gross off-white color and had a giant neon sign in the front. When I say it was small, I don't think this place had more than six rooms on the entire property. I got out of my car and looked at the sludge-filled, man-made swamp that was likely once a pool, and I walked into the lobby. It was small and smelled like a cheap cleaning solution. I walked up to the front desk, where a long-haired guy was reading a magazine. I stood in front of the desk for a second or two, waiting for him to acknowledge me. Yet my attempt at subtlety was in vain. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said. He glared at me and put his magazine to the side. ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to check in. The Midnight Press booked a room for me. It should be under Conner West,‚Äù I said. He tapped away at a computer that was on the desk and clicked his mouse a few times. ‚ÄúYeah, so, like your room isn‚Äôt ready yet,‚Äù he said in the most disinterested voice I had ever heard. I wanted to be sarcastic, I wanted to ask why the hell it wasn‚Äôt ready yet. It wasn‚Äôt like this was a big luxury hotel, my car is the only one in the parking lot for fucks sake. I took a deep breath, I couldn‚Äôt burn any bridges yet. ‚ÄúDo you know when it should be ready?‚Äù I asked. The man shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, maybe like an hour or something?‚Äù he said. I inhaled deeply and tried to hide my frustration. ‚ÄúOkay, I am kind of hungry so I‚Äôll go grab a bite to eat and I‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said before going back to his magazine. I walked out the door of the lobby and sat on a bench they had out front. I pulled out the pack of cigarettes that I had been puffing on since I started driving down this way. I lit the third to last one up and I started smoking. I felt the summer wind blowing on my face, the sun was starting to set and I was starting to understand the appeal of a small town. I didn‚Äôt hear the barrage of horns and yelling; I listened to a welcoming silence. The sound of cicadas hummed in the distance and I heard a wolf let out a howl. I looked over across the street and I saw a place that just called itself ‚ÄúThe Diner‚Äù. I figured I still had time to kill, and eating something that wasn‚Äôt potato chips and energy drinks might do me some good. I put my cigarette butt in the ashtray, and I started walking over.
The smell of bacon and burnt toast greeted me as I walked in. It was around eight o'clock on a Tuesday night and it was about as dead as you expected. I walked up to the counter and took a seat on a barstool. I looked at the sticky laminated menu that was already there. I don‚Äôt think this thing has been updated since the 2000s. A woman walked up to me with a small notebook in hand. ‚ÄúKnow what you want hun?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have a burger and fries with a chocolate shake,‚Äù I answered. She scribbled on her paper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be out in just a moment,‚Äù she said. She left and my eyes began to wander around the diner. Black and white tiles covered the floors and the booths all had a fake red leather. There was a jukebox in the corner of the room that had an ‚ÄúOut of order‚Äù sign on it. I looked next to it and the only other patron in the restaurant was sitting in a booth in the far corner. From where I sat I could already see the trench coat and stained Final Fantasy t-shirt. ‚ÄúI got an hour,‚Äù I said to myself before getting up and walking over to him. He was a man that could be described as husky. He had a beard that was kept way cleaner than his greasy hair that was wild and unkempt. He had a black fedora sitting next to him on the table. ‚ÄúHey I don‚Äôt mean to bother you sir,‚Äù I said. The man looked up from his meal, which was three grilled cheese sandwiches and a plate of bacon. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm a reporter from out of town, would you be willing to participate in an interview?‚Äù I added. The man finished chewing and took a sip of his drink. ‚ÄúSure, I could use the company!‚Äù He said joyfully. I sat down in front of him. ‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôre here for the murders?‚Äù He asked before taking a massive bite out of his grilled cheese. ‚ÄúYes actually,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù I said. He took a moment to respond while taking a sip from his straw. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not really a whole heck of a lot that happens around these parts. The police have tried to keep things quiet but that went out the door almost immediately,‚Äù he said. I pulled out my phone and started taking notes. ‚ÄúSo, did you know any of the victims?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo sir I did not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually from out of town,‚Äù he said before taking a bite of a piece of bacon. My face grew puzzled and I tiled my head. ‚ÄúOh, so what brings you to town then?‚Äù I asked. He ate another bite of bacon. ‚ÄúThe murders,‚Äù he said.

‚Äî‚Äî-4

The waitress brought over my food around the same time the man finished his second grilled cheese. ‚ÄúSo are you an investigator, journalist, or‚Ä¶‚Äù I said very confused. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm here for an alternative reason,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDark tourism?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He said with a face as confused as mine. ‚ÄúDark tourism, it‚Äôs when people go to check out really dark and disturbing things for a vacation,‚Äù I answered. He shook his head before taking a sip. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm here because someone hired me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, you are an investigator?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said before reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a business card and handed it to me. In big white letters on a black card it read: ‚ÄúDiscount Vampire Hunter‚Äù and under that in smaller letters was the name Gus VonHammer and his phone number next to that. I was starting to think I was being fucked with. ‚ÄúWell Mr. VonHammer, do you think it‚Äôs a vampire doing all of this?‚Äù I asked, trying to hold back every ounce of sarcasm in my voice. He let out a chuckle and shook his head. ‚ÄúNo no no, it‚Äôs obviously not a vampire,‚Äù he said. My eyebrow raised as I took a bite of my burger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a werewolf,‚Äù he said. I snorted right in front of him. ‚ÄúIs something funny?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúA werewolf?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYes, a werewolf,‚Äù he said with the seriousness of a doctor telling his patient the tests came back positive. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense, there‚Äôs been a string of murders and it‚Äôs not even a full moon,‚Äù I said, deciding to play along with the delusions this man was clearly encapsulated in. ‚ÄúOnly European werewolves do a monthly transformation,‚Äù he said. I took a bite of my fries. ‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù I asked while wondered if this was how Art Bell felt every time he was on air. ‚ÄúYes, North American werewolves transform nightly and are typically drifters in the day time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWow, I never knew that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe thing is, they mostly go after cattle, deer, and other similar animals. It‚Äôs rather unusual that they go after humans,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúSo, when you find this werewolf, are you going to shoot it with a silver bullet?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúKind of,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKind of?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shoot it with a hollow point forty-five and then while it‚Äôs down I‚Äôm going to cover it with gasoline and burn the body,‚Äù he said. I was happy to see that even small towns had crazy people. However, I was deeply disturbed by the fact that this man might kill a random person and claim he was a werewolf. I finished my milkshake and asked for a check. ‚ÄúKeep my business card,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you see anything out of the ordinary just let me know,‚Äù he said. I smiled and nodded my head as I placed a twenty-dollar bill on the table. ‚ÄúYou bet buddy,‚Äù I said, trying to leave as soon as possible. I left the diner and started walking over to the motel. If my room wasn‚Äôt ready it was going to take a lot to not throw a fit. I marched over and thought about what type of life Mr. VonHammer lived. He couldn‚Äôt have had a lot of family or friends close to him, because who the hell would let someone live in such delusion? As I was walking towards the motel lobby, something felt off. I shrugged it off as being creeped out by the guy I just spent the last hour talking to. When I got to the front door, it was broken off of its hinges. I walked past the broken door and my heart dropped. Blood was splattered all over the lobby. Viscera and bone fragments littered the linoleum floor like daisies in a meadow. What was left of the front desk clerk's head was sitting on the desk, his magazine soaking in blood. Torn limbs were scattered and a broken window led out to the night. A scream erupted out of me and I bolted out.

‚Äî‚Äî5 The blanket sat on my shoulders and a cup of coffee was in my hands. ‚ÄúI really wish you got introduced to our town in a better way,‚Äù Sheriff O‚ÄôNeil said. I said nothing as the shock was still processing itself out of my system. ‚ÄúWe have a peanut festival in March, it‚Äôs a really big thing‚Ä¶well big for us,‚Äù he said. The flashing lights of the ambulance coated us, the sirens had been cut once they got into the parking lot. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame really, he was a good kid,‚Äù the Sheriff said. ‚ÄúDo you need me to give a statement?‚Äù I mustered up. He stood awkwardly for a second and scratched his face. ‚ÄúLook, this ain‚Äôt really a big town, we know you had no involvement in any of this,‚Äù he said. Even in my recovering state of shock, alarm bells began to go off in my head. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked. The sheriff took his glasses off and leaned in towards me. ‚ÄúLook, it was probably a suicide, the guy was miserable and this just looked like a suicide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe was fucking decapitated and dismembered,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWatch your tone boy,‚Äù the sheriff said. ‚ÄúWatch my tone? Watch my fucking tone?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúUnless that guy threw himself in a wood chipper, I don‚Äôt see that being a suicide,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWatch your tone with me boy,‚Äù he said as his hand was slowly moving towards his pistol. I took a deep sigh. ‚ÄúIs there a place I can stay for the night?‚Äù I asked about choosing my life over questions. ‚ÄùWe contacted Gary; he should be here in a few minutes,‚Äù he said. I took a sip of my coffee and nodded my head. The sheriff no longer had his hand on his pistol. ‚ÄúHas this happened before?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI can't disclose that information,‚Äù he said. A deputy came up to the sheriff with a worried look on his face. ‚ÄúSir, I need to talk to you,‚Äù he said. Sheriff O‚ÄôNeil gave a thumbs up and looked at me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back in a few minutes,‚Äù the Sheriff said to me. He walked away and I sat in silence as I sipped my coffee. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the business card I had received. ‚ÄúWas he right?‚Äù I thought to myself. The officer's speed walked past me, the sheriff pointed at me. ‚ÄúStay out of trouble,‚Äù he said to me. The two got into a cop car and turned the sirens on immediately. Before I could blink they darted into the night.

Gary was the owner of the town motel. Although he tried to maintain as much of a professional presence as possible, he was clearly disturbed by everything that had transpired. ‚ÄúI can assure you, this isn‚Äôt a normal situation here,‚Äù he said. He was a short fat Italian man who was balding at the top of his head. ‚ÄúI do apologize that your stay this far has been delayed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI understand, things happen,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true‚Ä¶that‚Äôs mostly true,‚Äù he said as he pulled out the keys to my room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go ahead and comp this room for you and tell you what, you can have anything you want in the mini fridge,‚Äù he said to me. I held my duffle bag around my shoulder and walked inside the room. It was a rather unremarkable place, a tv that looked straight out of the 90s sat on a dresser that looked straight out of the 70s. The walls were covered with a wallpaper that had a variety of flowers on it and a painting of the ocean rested above the single bed. ‚ÄúAm I allowed to ask you a question?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOf course sir!‚Äù Gary said with a slight head nod. ‚ÄúThe kid who worked at the front desk, were you close to him?‚Äù I asked. He stood stiffly and rubbed his head. ‚ÄúI mean, we were about as close as a front desk worker and his manager could be. I didn‚Äôt really know him personally,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs fair,‚Äù I said before putting my bag on the bed. ‚ÄúDo you know if he was dealing with any mental health issues?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre a rather interesting character,‚Äù Gary said with a confused face. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve heard,‚Äù I responded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm allowed to give out information like that,‚Äù he said. I raised my hands up and shook my head. ‚ÄúAnd I fully respect that,‚Äù I said. I bit my lip for a moment and lowered my hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the police are saying that, he passed because of a suicide,‚Äù I said. Gary took a deep breath as a look of grimace overwhelmed his face. ‚ÄúSir, it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm sorry for the inconvenience that this night has caused you. I will not be answering any questions regarding my employees mental wellbeing. I wish you a good evening and a pleasant stay,‚Äù he said before handing me over the hotel key and walking off into the night.

What they never tell you about seeing a graphic crime scene, is you can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. The T.V was tuned to something stupid as the scene of the lobby played in my head on repeat. I looked at the alarm clock and saw it was after two. I got out of bed and walked to the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and looked at the heavy bags that were under my eyes. I walked to the mini fridge and looked at the inside. I grabbed two airplane bottles of Jack and a can of Coke. The night wasn‚Äôt going to go any faster if I was buzzed or sober. The cracks of the airplane bottles made me salivate as I poured my drink. I opened the curtains and sat in the chair that was right next to the window. The horror dawned on me that I very well might have been the last person that kid interacted with. Thoughts began to run through my head, speculations of a person I had only interacted with for less than five minutes. Then I saw a flashlight walking towards the lobby. I closed the curtains and put my shoes on. I looked for anything to arm myself with, the best I could do was a lighter and a can of complimentary hairspray. I peaked out the window and saw that the flashlight was now inside the lobby. Either the purest ambition of journalistic integrity overcame me, or the stupidest impulse override my senses, but either way, I was outside and walking towards the lobby. I was crouching in the parking lot, trying to make myself as small as possible. I got to the window of the lobby and I peered through. A figure was looking at the crime scene, they were hunched over a bloodstain and were taking a photo of the things around them. I slowly began to start walking away and towards my room. The game plan was still developing in my head. I was going to lock myself in my room and call the police. If anyone who wasn‚Äôt a cop came by, I was going to use my crude flamethrower to distract them as I ran to my car. ‚ÄúA bit late for a stroll isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù A voice said from behind me. I turned around and held the lighter and hairspray up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any trouble,‚Äù I said with a quiver of fear in my voice. I could only see the silhouette of the figure standing in front of me. The bright light of the street lamp radiated a dim gross orange. ‚ÄúI never assumed you did,‚Äù he said as he got closer. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see you again, I will say I wish it was under better conditions,‚Äù the silhouette said. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWell, you should still have my business card,‚Äù he said before stepping close enough to where I could see his face. ‚ÄúWhy the hell are you here?‚Äù I asked. He let out a chuckle. ‚ÄúSimple, I‚Äôm being paid to investigate and kill the werewolf that‚Äôs in town and this was the second most recent werewolf attack,‚Äù Gus VonHammer said. ‚ÄúAre you still going on about this werewolf shit?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAlso what the fuck do you mean second most recent?‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúWhat do you suppose it was then? A gust of wind?‚Äù Gus said sarcastically. I was baffled by such a statement. ‚ÄúWhat? No this has to be a serial killer or something,‚Äù I said. He nodded his head in silence for a second. ‚ÄúSo, a person broke down the doors of a motel lobby and violently dismembered one of its employees before jumping through the window and then went to the local baptist church where they did the exact same crime to two teenagers who were in a car together?‚Äù He asked with a smug look on his face. ‚ÄúW‚Ä¶what,‚Äù was all I was able to muster up. ‚ÄúListen, I know it‚Äôs hard to believe, I know it sounds batshit insane. However, you have to believe me when I say that a werewolf is on the loose,‚Äù he explained.

1 I stared out at the city skyline, a can of cheap beer in one band and a cigarette in the other. The sun was starting to set and for the first time in awhile, I felt like I could breathe. I still had no clue what I was going to do, my life at that moment was a train wreck but I felt that the fire had died down. Even if only for a breath. I had no place to stay anymore and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I could ever trust anyone again. A stream of smoke blew out of my mouth; the melody of the city was a barrage of angry horn honking that would go on long into the night. My phone rang and I looked down to see who it was. ‚ÄúEditor Murphy,‚Äù the screen read. I answered the phone and took a sip of beer. ‚ÄúHello, boss,‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúHey, West, I know this is the last second but would you be willing to come to the office?‚Äù He asked. My stomach sank, with the way everything was going, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I got fired at this point. ‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúOh yeah, it‚Äôs just I have an assignment that Hailey had to drop out of. It‚Äôs a pretty big assignment and I figured it might be more up your alley anyway,‚Äù he said. I took a sip of beer. ‚ÄúWhen do you need me in the office?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúCome by first thing in the morning and we‚Äôll talk,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell that sounds good to me,‚Äù I said before hanging up on the phone.

‚Äî‚Äî-2

‚ÄúVirginia?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy took a sip of his black coffee. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a bit of a way away, but the company is willing to pay for your travel expenses,‚Äù he said. The dying light bulb in his office continued to flicker. Throughout my entire time working here, his lights were always like that. I looked at the smoke-stained wallpaper of his office. ‚ÄúWhat does the assignment entail?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy took another swig of black coffee and moved his seat closer to his desk. ‚ÄúThere is a town called Wayfield and they‚Äôve had a series of grisly murders occur,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen some of the leaked photos online, and they are truly grotesque. I about damn near vomited when I first saw them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo like, do you want me to solve it or something?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt would be amazing if you did, but no, I just want you to go down and interview some of the people in the area. It‚Äôs a small town, and everyone seems to know everyone. It‚Äôll be a juicy story,‚Äù he said. I sat in silence for a moment, running through every situation in my head. ‚ÄúWhat time do I leave?‚Äù I asked. Mr. Murphy let out a smile.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî3

I drove for five hours, and everything I still owned was packed in the duffle bag I had been using as a suitcase since high school. I pulled up to the smallest motel I had ever seen. It was painted a gross off-white color and had a giant neon sign in the front. When I say it was small, I don't think this place had more than six rooms on the entire property. I got out of my car and looked at the sludge-filled, man-made swamp that was likely once a pool, and I walked into the lobby. It was small and smelled like a cheap cleaning solution. I walked up to the front desk, where a long-haired guy was reading a magazine. I stood in front of the desk for a second or two, waiting for him to acknowledge me. Yet my attempt at subtlety was in vain. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said. He glared at me and put his magazine to the side. ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to check in. The Midnight Press booked a room for me. It should be under Conner West,‚Äù I said. He tapped away at a computer that was on the desk and clicked his mouse a few times. ‚ÄúYeah, so, like your room isn‚Äôt ready yet,‚Äù he said in the most disinterested voice I had ever heard. I wanted to be sarcastic, I wanted to ask why the hell it wasn‚Äôt ready yet. It wasn‚Äôt like this was a big luxury hotel, my car is the only one in the parking lot for fucks sake. I took a deep breath, I couldn‚Äôt burn any bridges yet. ‚ÄúDo you know when it should be ready?‚Äù I asked. The man shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, maybe like an hour or something?‚Äù he said. I inhaled deeply and tried to hide my frustration. ‚ÄúOkay, I am kind of hungry so I‚Äôll go grab a bite to eat and I‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said before going back to his magazine. I walked out the door of the lobby and sat on a bench they had out front. I pulled out the pack of cigarettes that I had been puffing on since I started driving down this way. I lit the third to last one up and I started smoking. I felt the summer wind blowing on my face, the sun was starting to set and I was starting to understand the appeal of a small town. I didn‚Äôt hear the barrage of horns and yelling; I listened to a welcoming silence. The sound of cicadas hummed in the distance and I heard a wolf let out a howl. I looked over across the street and I saw a place that just called itself ‚ÄúThe Diner‚Äù. I figured I still had time to kill, and eating something that wasn‚Äôt potato chips and energy drinks might do me some good. I put my cigarette butt in the ashtray, and I started walking over.
The smell of bacon and burnt toast greeted me as I walked in. It was around eight o'clock on a Tuesday night and it was about as dead as you expected. I walked up to the counter and took a seat on a barstool. I looked at the sticky laminated menu that was already there. I don‚Äôt think this thing has been updated since the 2000s. A woman walked up to me with a small notebook in hand. ‚ÄúKnow what you want hun?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have a burger and fries with a chocolate shake,‚Äù I answered. She scribbled on her paper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be out in just a moment,‚Äù she said. She left and my eyes began to wander around the diner. Black and white tiles covered the floors and the booths all had a fake red leather. There was a jukebox in the corner of the room that had an ‚ÄúOut of order‚Äù sign on it. I looked next to it and the only other patron in the restaurant was sitting in a booth in the far corner. From where I sat I could already see the trench coat and stained Final Fantasy t-shirt. ‚ÄúI got an hour,‚Äù I said to myself before getting up and walking over to him. He was a man that could be described as husky. He had a beard that was kept way cleaner than his greasy hair that was wild and unkempt. He had a black fedora sitting next to him on the table. ‚ÄúHey I don‚Äôt mean to bother you sir,‚Äù I said. The man looked up from his meal, which was three grilled cheese sandwiches and a plate of bacon. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm a reporter from out of town, would you be willing to participate in an interview?‚Äù I added. The man finished chewing and took a sip of his drink. ‚ÄúSure, I could use the company!‚Äù He said joyfully. I sat down in front of him. ‚ÄúI take it you‚Äôre here for the murders?‚Äù He asked before taking a massive bite out of his grilled cheese. ‚ÄúYes actually,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù I said. He took a moment to respond while taking a sip from his straw. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not really a whole heck of a lot that happens around these parts. The police have tried to keep things quiet but that went out the door almost immediately,‚Äù he said. I pulled out my phone and started taking notes. ‚ÄúSo, did you know any of the victims?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo sir I did not,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually from out of town,‚Äù he said before taking a bite of a piece of bacon. My face grew puzzled and I tiled my head. ‚ÄúOh, so what brings you to town then?‚Äù I asked. He ate another bite of bacon. ‚ÄúThe murders,‚Äù he said.

‚Äî‚Äî-4

The waitress brought over my food around the same time the man finished his second grilled cheese. ‚ÄúSo are you an investigator, journalist, or‚Ä¶‚Äù I said very confused. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm here for an alternative reason,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDark tourism?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He said with a face as confused as mine. ‚ÄúDark tourism, it‚Äôs when people go to check out really dark and disturbing things for a vacation,‚Äù I answered. He shook his head before taking a sip. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm here because someone hired me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, you are an investigator?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said before reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a business card and handed it to me. In big white letters on a black card it read: ‚ÄúDiscount Vampire Hunter‚Äù and under that in smaller letters was the name Gus VonHammer and his phone number next to that. I was starting to think I was being fucked with. ‚ÄúWell Mr. VonHammer, do you think it‚Äôs a vampire doing all of this?‚Äù I asked, trying to hold back every ounce of sarcasm in my voice. He let out a chuckle and shook his head. ‚ÄúNo no no, it‚Äôs obviously not a vampire,‚Äù he said. My eyebrow raised as I took a bite of my burger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a werewolf,‚Äù he said. I snorted right in front of him. ‚ÄúIs something funny?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúA werewolf?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYes, a werewolf,‚Äù he said with the seriousness of a doctor telling his patient the tests came back positive. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense, there‚Äôs been a string of murders and it‚Äôs not even a full moon,‚Äù I said, deciding to play along with the delusions this man was clearly encapsulated in. ‚ÄúOnly European werewolves do a monthly transformation,‚Äù he said. I took a bite of my fries. ‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù I asked while wondered if this was how Art Bell felt every time he was on air. ‚ÄúYes, North American werewolves transform nightly and are typically drifters in the day time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWow, I never knew that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe thing is, they mostly go after cattle, deer, and other similar animals. It‚Äôs rather unusual that they go after humans,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúSo, when you find this werewolf, are you going to shoot it with a silver bullet?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúKind of,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKind of?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shoot it with a hollow point forty-five and then while it‚Äôs down I‚Äôm going to cover it with gasoline and burn the body,‚Äù he said. I was happy to see that even small towns had crazy people. However, I was deeply disturbed by the fact that this man might kill a random person and claim he was a werewolf. I finished my milkshake and asked for a check. ‚ÄúKeep my business card,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you see anything out of the ordinary just let me know,‚Äù he said. I smiled and nodded my head as I placed a twenty-dollar bill on the table. ‚ÄúYou bet buddy,‚Äù I said, trying to leave as soon as possible. I left the diner and started walking over to the motel. If my room wasn‚Äôt ready it was going to take a lot to not throw a fit. I marched over and thought about what type of life Mr. VonHammer lived. He couldn‚Äôt have had a lot of family or friends close to him, because who the hell would let someone live in such delusion? As I was walking towards the motel lobby, something felt off. I shrugged it off as being creeped out by the guy I just spent the last hour talking to. When I got to the front door, it was broken off of its hinges. I walked past the broken door and my heart dropped. Blood was splattered all over the lobby. Viscera and bone fragments littered the linoleum floor like daisies in a meadow. What was left of the front desk clerk's head was sitting on the desk, his magazine soaking in blood. Torn limbs were scattered and a broken window led out to the night. A scream erupted out of me and I bolted out.

‚Äî‚Äî5 The blanket sat on my shoulders and a cup of coffee was in my hands. ‚ÄúI really wish you got introduced to our town in a better way,‚Äù Sheriff O‚ÄôNeil said. I said nothing as the shock was still processing itself out of my system. ‚ÄúWe have a peanut festival in March, it‚Äôs a really big thing‚Ä¶well big for us,‚Äù he said. The flashing lights of the ambulance coated us, the sirens had been cut once they got into the parking lot. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame really, he was a good kid,‚Äù the Sheriff said. ‚ÄúDo you need me to give a statement?‚Äù I mustered up. He stood awkwardly for a second and scratched his face. ‚ÄúLook, this ain‚Äôt really a big town, we know you had no involvement in any of this,‚Äù he said. Even in my recovering state of shock, alarm bells began to go off in my head. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked. The sheriff took his glasses off and leaned in towards me. ‚ÄúLook, it was probably a suicide, the guy was miserable and this just looked like a suicide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe was fucking decapitated and dismembered,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWatch your tone boy,‚Äù the sheriff said. ‚ÄúWatch my tone? Watch my fucking tone?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúUnless that guy threw himself in a wood chipper, I don‚Äôt see that being a suicide,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWatch your tone with me boy,‚Äù he said as his hand was slowly moving towards his pistol. I took a deep sigh. ‚ÄúIs there a place I can stay for the night?‚Äù I asked about choosing my life over questions. ‚ÄùWe contacted Gary; he should be here in a few minutes,‚Äù he said.

We are in the big year of 2025. Three months away from 2026. 

Women all around the world are finally waking up and no longer settling for the bare minimum from men. Women are no longer tolerating BS from men. Women are finally recognizing red flags and leave at the first sign of one. Women have finally had ENOUGH. 

There is a reason a ‚Äòmale loneliness‚Äô epidemic is happening everywhere. BECAUSE WOMEN ARE FINALLY WAKING UP. WOMEN ARE FINALLY REALIZING THAT THEY WILL ONLY LET MEN INTO THEIR LIVES IF THEY ENRICH THEIR LIVES AND BRING THEM PEACE. WOMEN HAVE FINALLY HAD ENOUGH OF SUFFERING AT THE HANDS OF MEN WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THEIR LIFE PARTNERS.

SO WHY IS THIS NOT BEING REFLECTED IN ROMANCE BOOKS? 

Why is it that when I crack open a book‚ÄîPUBLISHED THIS YEAR TOO, MIND YOU‚Äîthat I still find the MMC mistreating/wronging the FMC‚Ä¶ only for her to instantly forgive him after a mere ‚Äúsorry‚Äù from him?? 

THAT SHIT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE. THE OLD ROMANCE BOOK FORMULA NO LONGER WORKS IN THIS DAY AND AGE. 

If an MMC wrongs/mistreats/hurts an FMC in ANY way, LET THE FMC BE NASTY TO HIM BACK IN RETALIATION. LET HER DRAG HIS ASS THROUGH THE MUD. LET HER AIR OUT HIS DIRTY LAUNDRY. LET HER RUIN HIS LIFE!!! LET HER GET HER LICK BACK!! AND NOT IN THE ‚Äúoh he calls her scum one time so she then puts toothpaste in his coffee tee-hee ü§™‚Äù SUPPOSEDLY QUIRKY ENEMIES-TO-LOVERS WAY. I‚Äôm talking ACTUALLY hitting him where it hurts in an angsty way and it gives you COMPLETE satisfaction when you read it as a reader! 

*‚ÄúOh but that wouldn‚Äôt be a great start to a healthy relationship though.‚Äù*

Uh, yeah, it would. It ACTUALLY would. Because it would be his lesson learned moment to not mess with her. That SHE CAN EASILY LEAVE AT THE FIRST SIGN OF NONSENSE. SHE CAN EASILY DISCARD HIM LIKE TRASH AS SOON AS HE FUCKS UP. AND SHE CAN CRUSH HIM IF HE TRIES HEEEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!!!!! 

BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE PUT UP WITH A LOOOOOOOOT MORE FROM MEN THIS PAST MILLENNIA. BUT NOT ANYMORE. WOMEN ARE FINALLY PUTTING THEMSELVES FIRST THESE DAYS. WOMEN ARE CHOOSING PEACE OVER MEN. 

WOMEN DO NOT NEED MEN ANYMORE. IF A MAN WANTS TO BE IN A WOMAN‚ÄôS LIFE, HE NEEDS TO LOCK THE FUCK IN. HE NEEDS TO PUT IN THE WORK. 

IF AN MMC FUCKS UP AND HURTS AN FMC IN ANY FUCKING WAY, **IT IS YOUR FUCKING JOB AS A FUCKING ROMANCE AUTHOR** TO MAKE THE FMC ACTUALLY STAND UP FOR HERSELF!! MAKE HER HOLD GRUDGES FOR AT LEAST 10 CHAPTERS!!! MAKE HER GET NASTY WITH HER WORDS IN RETALIATION!! 

*‚ÄúOkay but not every FMC has the kind of characterization that makes it possible for her to act like that though.‚Äù*

Yeah. And you know what the solution to that is? 

LET THE FMC MENTALLY CHECK OUT. LET HER LOOK AT HIM WITH EMPTY EYES. EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO APOLOGIZE AND REPENT FOR HIS SINS FOR 15 CHAPTERS AT THE VERY FUCKING LEAST, IT JUST BOUNCES OFF HER. If anything, that‚Äôs even scarier because when a woman mentally checks out, it‚Äôs close to impossible to get her to like you again. And that would be A LOT OF WORK for a romance author. BUT THAT IS WHAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE!!! 

BECAUSE THE!! OLD!! FORMULA!! OF MMC-FUCKING-UP-THEN-SAYING-MERE-SORRY-THEN-FMC-FORGIVING-HIM-WITHIN-10-PAGES DOES NOT FUCKING WORK ANYMORE!!!! 

I used to be of the opinion that romance books do not need to be more than 300 pages long. But now? I am of the firm opinion that romance books SHOULD BE MUCH LONGER TO GIVE IT ROOM FOR THE MMC TO EARN FORGIVENESS FROM THE FMC. TO MAKE HIM WORK FOR IT!!! TO LET US SEE HER REAM HIS ASS!!! 

BECAUSE FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT!!!! MEN CANNOT MISTREAT WOMEN ANYMORE IN ANY WAY!!!! 

Phew. Anyways. 

Agree, disagree, your choice. I‚Äôve said my peace. 

(I‚Äôm talking contemporary romance here. Don‚Äôt be bringing up dark romance I‚Äôm begging you because whatever happens in that sub-genre is none of my business and will never be my business because I don‚Äôt read it and will never read it so I can‚Äôt comment on that.)

Or is it too awkward?,"I (30F) have a crush on a man who‚Äôs a bit older than me. He owns the coffee shop I go to regularly. It started off casual, but over time we‚Äôve built up this kind of lowkey flirty, slow-burn vibe. Here‚Äôs the rundown:

	‚Ä¢	He remembered my name and order early on.
	‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs usually very confident and friendly with customers, but he gets noticeably shy and awkward around me. Sometimes forgets my order or seems flustered when I‚Äôm there.
	‚Ä¢	One time we ended up talking for almost an hour about personal stuff. It felt really natural and connected. We tend to talk more when it‚Äôs just the two of us (I usually go during slower hours), but if people come in, we both kind of shut it down quickly. So sometimes we talk a lot, other times barely at all.
	‚Ä¢	He‚Äôs mentioned things like wanting a big family, and brought up a fancy restaurant out of nowhere once‚Äîwhich felt very ‚Äúdate-coded.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	He always says goodbye to his employees when leaving, but if I‚Äôm there, he specifically says goodbye to me by name. Every single time but not to other customers. 
	‚Ä¢	He notices when I change my hair and always comments on it right away.
	‚Ä¢	One of the other baristas (a girl) has looked at us during interactions and made a kind of ‚Äúaww‚Äù or knowing face more than once.
	‚Ä¢	There‚Äôs a lot of unspoken tension, but it‚Äôs been dragging on for a while.

We follow each other on Instagram, and I almost sent him this DM:

‚ÄúHey, I was wondering if you‚Äôd want to go out sometime. Just figured I‚Äôd ask. No pressure at all.‚Äù

But I froze. I don‚Äôt want to make things weird, especially since I go there often. At the same time, I feel stuck in this ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù loop and just want to move on‚Äîeither with him, or from him.

Something funny happened recently too: I ran into someone I know while I was at the coffee shop. She had no idea I had a crush on him, but immediately picked up on the vibe and was literally about to go ask him if he was single‚Äîfor me. She‚Äôs in a relationship herself and just wanted to help, because she knows I‚Äôm single and thought something was clearly going on. So now I‚Äôm thinking, if even she picked up on it without knowing anything, maybe I‚Äôm not imagining it?

Is it weird or unprofessional to ask someone out when I met them at their job (even if he owns the place)? Is a DM like that too forward or just honest?

‚ÄãI'm a Project Manager with 3 years of PM experience and 8 years of technical background in game development/EdTech‚Äîmy whole career has been in those two industries. I was interviewing for a PM role at a big game studio that was specifically looking for a technical/hands-on background. 

‚ÄãThe interviewer (who was a Senior PM) asked me this curveball:
‚Äã""Let's say you're just appointed as a branch manager in a coffee shop. What's the maximum revenue you can achieve? Tell me your process.""

‚ÄãI immediately flagged that I have zero experience in F&B, but the interviewer insisted I should ""act like I know"" and told me managing a coffee shop is ""similar to managing game production."" 

‚ÄãThe whole interview was essentially this type of question‚Äînothing specific about game production, pipelines, or technical management. It was me at the end asking the interviewer about what KPI or metrics they are using, the workflow, the on going project and what they need, etc. 
I ended up having a hard time satisfying the interviewer, although I told them I could give them a detailed breakdown of any software/game production process and planning.

The interviewer also told me the PM there usually doesnt even work with the budget because the role focus on managing production.

‚ÄãMy question is: Is this normal for a Senior PM to ask? I personally feel this was an unfair question that had nothing to do with the role or industry I was interviewing for. 
Am I taking this too personally, or was this a bad interview experience?

I've been on dating apps since I was probably 21. I've always held onto the idea of falling in love. Well, fast-forward, I'm 28 and have never had a boyfriend. Not without interest. I'm fairly good looking, in shape, educated, have a feminine curated vintage style. Just hasn't worked out for me in the rare instances where I do grow feelings. 

Anyways, to the point. I moved to DC two years ago for grad school and I know this place is a nightmare for dating. Especially as a woman, it seems. The apps aren't working and I'm trying to go out in the city more, do more in public, be around people more. I'm extroverted and make friends easily but approaching men feels so mortifying. It's less fear for my safety than the fear of humiliation. 

Each time I've seen a man I find attractive while walking around or in coffee shops, they're usually with someone who looks like a friend (typically another man). I don't want the other person to feel awful or uncomfortable if I make a move on their friend. How do I, assuming I can overcome my fear of approaching a man in a still new-to-me city, approach this situation? Is it impossible with just two friends instead of a group where the interaction is less pointed or stark? 

Follow up question: is it weird to go to a bar by myself as a woman? How does that work as a single person? None of my graduate school friends like going out but I do and Iove meeting new people. I don't want to wait for someone to ask me to go out on the town anymore. C'est la vie.

I think phones have distanced all of us in how we interact socially. I'm tired of it. I want connection and I want intimacy that didn't start by swiping this or that way. I want to be in the world not just interact with the representation of it. ",1,1759203677.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1nu2phn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/1nu2phn/tesla_wishlist_features_they_should_really_have/,Tesla Wishlist: Features They Should Really Have by Now,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I feel like Tesla‚Äôs ahead of the game on performance, range, and OTA updates. But when it comes to the little quality-of-life features, I feel like there are some features in which they‚Äôre lagging behind brands that have been doing this stuff for years. I think the Model S/X were ahead of their time for the longest time, but I feel even with this year's update did very little to keep them relevant.

Here‚Äôs my running wishlist of things I wish they‚Äôd finally add:

- Bird‚Äôs eye / 360¬∞ view, literally every mainstream carmaker has it. Idc about licensing fees, I‚Äôm sure they could do some cool collaboration with SpaceX.

- HUD + AR navigation, imagine directions projected onto the windshield or AR overlays on the road itself. This should be standard on higher-end models.

- More customizable UI (knobs/physical controls), not everything needs to be buried in the touchscreen. I‚Äôd love physical climate knobs. I know there are aftermarket mods for them, but Tesla should just offer it directly.

- ‚ÄúPhone left on charger‚Äù alert, simple but useful. Ping me if I forget my phone.

- Display of altitude / elevation, bonus points if it‚Äôs visualized on the map with the road lines.

- Adjustable / adaptive cup holders, bottles, cans, coffee mugs‚Ä¶ one size doesn‚Äôt fit all.

- Powered frunk, Rn only the Cybertruck has it. No reason every model shouldn‚Äôt. Even the refreshed Model S/X skipped it, which feels like a miss for cars in that price bracket.

- Steer-by-wire, still Cybertruck-only. I'm genuinley really dissapointed the refreshed 2026 S/X didn't get it. It feels like such a missed opportunity. That‚Äôs a bad miss against competitors.

- Retractable spoiler (RS7-style), make it Plaid-only. Better aero plus a way more aggressive look.

- Heated/cooled cup holders, yeah, kinda gimmicky, but luxury cars have had this for over a decade.

- Massaging seats, no excuse at this price point. BMW/Audi/Merc have offered this forever, and it should be standard in the S/X. I'm not crazy about this addition ngl.

- Executive rear seating option, reclining, massaging rear seats like S-Class/7 Series. If Tesla wants to compete in the luxury space, the backseat needs some TLC too. Right now the S/X just aren‚Äôt offering the standard luxury features their rivals do.

- Automatic doors (Model S too, not just X), the flagship sedan should have powered open/close like other luxury cars. Locking this to the X only feels like a way to push people into that model, which makes no sense.

Tesla nails the big stuff, but I feel it‚Äôs these smaller features that make a car feel truly next level. And honestly, I feel like they‚Äôre starting to fall behind other luxury cars on this stuff.

I really wish I could talk to my therapist about this, but I was just laid off from my job yesterday, so I suddenly lost my work benefit that covers my therapy without enough notice to even see her one last time to tie up loose ends. Even with my insurance that doesn't run out until the end of October, I can't afford my therapist without the benefit now that I have absolutely no income. But I need to vent and maybe get some advice before I explode, and I don't want to burden anyone around me right now because we're all going through it (majority of my friends are coworkers who also got laid off).

About a year ago I fucked up by telling a friend I was interested in them. They said they wanted space and that they didn't want to talk to me for a while. After 3 months went by with no contact, I emoji reacted to a post of theirs on social media because they accomplished something big that people don't do every day, and I wanted to show my happiness for them even if we weren't talking. I didn't say anything else and had no intention of continuing to interact because I wanted to remain respectful of their boundary. They began interacting with me and responded to my reaction by saying they would like to hang out again. We've been seeing each other maybe once very 2 months since then for maybe 2-3 hours at a time for coffee and small talk.

Before we went no contact for a while, they mentioned not wanting to talk or spend a lot time with me, but the moment got cut short and we never got back to discussing it before I caused the big relational nosedive. So before our first meetup after no contact, I asked them if they were positive that it's what they wanted and let them know that we definitely didn't have to see each other again if it wasn't something they genuinely wanted. They got upset with me after this and finally broke the news that they had been wanting to avoid me long before no contact because I write too long of messages and expect too much emotional labor from them when we talk. It's true that I had been complaining about my problems a lot, and I'm very wordy. But whenever there was an interruption in our communication before, they would downplay it in some way or another, usually by saying how busy or tired they had been. I had no idea that during that time when I thought things were fine, they were actually going through an incredibly difficult time in one of their intimate relationships because they never told me anything bad had happened, despite me asking them about how their life was going pretty regularly. I felt pretty blindsided by discovering that they had a problem with me. I had thought that they would let me know if they didn't want to hear something from me. Despite their previous feelings, they assured me that they did want to meet again still.

I did my best to apologize for being a burden in the past, and since then I have been doing my best to not be one now. I cut most of my messages down to single sentences and have been trying to keep any talk about what goes on in my life as brief as I can and share most of my feelings with other people. But after finding a better therapist and reflecting on how I was in the past for a long while, I wanted to 1) have a discussion with my friend to apologize for things I realized I had done wrong/ways I had been toxic before and 2) ask them if they had any other grievances they wanted to air out/wanted an apology for anything hurtful I had done without realizing it. I wanted to be precise with what I was asking for, so this message was a bit longer. They said thank you and said that hey would read it and respond better at a future time.

After more than a month went by without me bothering them about it, I asked this person for some reassurance that they were still planning on responding in the future. To sum up their reaction, they got upset with me again, said they were going through something serious right now, told me to stop pressuring them to engage in the conversation, and told me I needed to needed to get over it and move on because the situations I wanted to apologize for happened a while ago and I guess aren't relevant anymore. They also told me that my messages were too long again. I just went back and read what I wrote again, and the first paragraph I sent was 5 sentences. The second paragraph I sent was 8 sentences.

I snapped after this because I never demanded that they engage with the contents of my requests. I literally just wanted a yes or no about whether or not I should continue to wait around for a future message that there were no time limits on.

I ended up telling them I was sorry for misunderstanding their previous response and assuming that it meant that they were interested in communicating, and I told them I didn't realize my messages were sooo long still (again, the request for a serious conversation in the future was the only thing I sent that was more than 1-2 sentences). I told them I wouldn't pry into their business (I assume that they don't want to tell me about it since they stopped telling me anything a long time ago), but that I was here and my door is always open if they do need any reasonable support from me. Then I told them that I was also no longer going to participate in a shared interest at the same location as them anymore so that I could put some distance between us. They read the message and didn't respond.

I feel terrible now. My apologies in the our last communication don't read as serious apologies to me because I was was hurt from feeling misunderstood and being defensive. I also didn't bother to say anything about further changing my behavior or trying harder to interact with them in a way they are comfortable with. And I only want to put distance between us because I feel like a failure for not being able to figure out how to communicate correctly and I feel like I don't currently feel like I deserve more chances to get it right. I feel stupid for offering support when they clearly don't want me to know about their life.

I keep expecting an emotional investment from them that never agreed to give me. I can't figure out how to be friends with people without heavy emotional conversations and I don't seem to be able to understand the point of such limited friendships the way other people seem to. It's embarrassing that I keep running back to them and trying to push for more than what they are offering. This is all why I believe I am in the wrong and am the asshole in this situation.

I really needed to vent because of how stressed I am due to life circumstances. Advice isn't necessary, but I will absolutely take it if anyone has any to give. How would you proceed with this friendship? I want to apologize for causing them to feel stressed and pressured, and I want to admit that my last response perhaps wasn't the most mature, but after being the one to unanimously decide that distance is the way to go, I feel like I have forfeited my right to message them about all of this. On the other hand, I wonder if despite saying it's not the case, maybe this person actually does hate me and I'm too delusional to see it...",3,1759202795.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

I've been obsessing over fleece hoodies lately, and I thought I'd share my experience and knowledge about these cozy pieces of clothing that have basically become my second skin during colder months.

I recently discovered this amazing fleece hoodie (https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) that completely changed my perspective on what comfort means. But before I dive deeper into that, let me break down the different types of fleece hoodies you might encounter.

First up, we've got the classic Polar fleece hoodies. These are probably what most people think of when they hear ""fleece."" They're warm, lightweight, and perfect for layering. The material is synthetic but feels incredibly soft against your skin.

Then there's Micro fleece - think of it as polar fleece's thinner cousin. It's super lightweight and perfect for those chilly autumn mornings when you need something warm but not too heavy. I love wearing these during my morning runs.

Sherpa fleece hoodies are becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason! They're basically like wearing a sheep (in the best way possible). The inside is usually lined with this incredibly soft, fuzzy material that feels like clouds.

Cotton-blend fleece hoodies combine the best of both worlds - the warmth of fleece with the breathability of cotton. They're perfect for everyday wear and tend to be more durable than pure fleece options.

Performance fleece is designed for active people. These hoodies often include moisture-wicking properties and are perfect for outdoor activities. They keep you warm without making you overheat.

Speaking of staying warm, I recently picked up this amazing fleece hoodie (https://athometouch.com/fleece-hoodie) that combines durability with style. It's become my go-to for everything from grocery runs to weekend hikes.

When choosing a fleece hoodie, consider the weight of the material. Lightweight fleece (100-200 gsm) works great for mild weather and layering. Midweight fleece (200-300 gsm) is your everyday option, while heavyweight fleece (300+ gsm) is perfect for those really cold days.

Don't forget to check the care instructions! Most fleece hoodies are machine washable, but some require special care to maintain their softness and shape. I always wash mine in cold water and avoid fabric softeners.

One thing I've learned is that investing in a quality fleece hoodie is totally worth it. They last longer, maintain their shape better, and honestly just feel nicer to wear. Plus, they're versatile enough to wear anywhere - from coffee runs to camping trips.

So there you have it - everything I know about fleece hoodies! Whether you're looking for something to wear while hiking or just want to stay cozy while working from home, there's definitely a perfect fleece hoodie out there for you.",1,1759202595.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

Last night I was up way later than I intended to working on an essay due tonight. I tried to call out of work just for today because I am overwhelmed with assignments and an exam as well, but my manager told me no because there was no one to cover me. My shift today was 10 am to 4 pm so I figured whatever I‚Äôll go. I was super tired and my manager even let me run to the local store to grab a coffee. After doing this he told me its a bad look to be so tired in front if the customers and sent me home. Because i could really use these hours I asked if I could get a second chance and he said sure come back in at 4 because another person called out sick(probably until closing at 9) so I was grateful. I went home drank a ton of caffeine and worked on some school work. When i went in at 4 I felt much more awake, handled customers with ease and got all the other tasks I needed handled, so I started fixing some signs on our display foods. This is when he tapped me on the shoulder at around 6:10 and told me that one of the owners that watches the cameras said I seemed tired and sent me home AGAIN. Basically all day there was no one working the counter besides the few hours I was there. I was not tired and had done plenty of work even getting compliments from customers. This whole day that i tried calling out of I could have been working on school but instead was treated like this and sent home both times. Im not sure what to make of this especially because i know for a fact i was perfectly fine the second time. Any advice or opinions on this situation would be appreciated thank you for reading.

I'm a 24 year old guy and I‚Äôve been in a relationship with a 25 year old woman who I‚Äôll call Jane for a little over two months now. Seeing as we‚Äôve been dating for a little while, Jane invited me to a BBQ with her family at her parents‚Äô house. She figured that it‚Äôd be a good opportunity for me to meet her parents, and I was excited and agreed.¬†

The day of the cookout, when we got there her family seemed a bit weirded out by me. Her aunts were very social with me, but the rest of them kept their distance, giving me odd glances. After a couple minutes of being there, I asked Jane to introduce me to her parents since that was one of the main reasons I had been invited, so she did. We went into the backyard where the food was cooking and she led me to a tall gentleman manning the grill. She introduced me and I reached out my hand to him for a handshake, giving him a polite smile and greeting him, but all I got in return was a glare with an eyebrow raised. Evidently, I was a little confused by the situation.

¬†Now here‚Äôs some information that you‚Äôre probably going to need. Jane and her family are African American. Me? I am PALE. When I say pale I mean a polar bear in a snowstorm kind of pale.

Back to the story, her dad asked somebody to take over the grill and stepped aside with Jane, but I could hear every single word shared between the two. He started talking to her about how he wasn‚Äôt too happy with the fact that she was dating a white man, and that she‚Äôd do better with somebody her own race. He also said something about that since I was white I could separate her family? I don‚Äôt know, that part was less clear to me because of the loud environment. When she came back to me, I acted as if I hadn‚Äôt heard a thing, suggesting that we help get plates from the house.

Around an hour later, when I was eating food at one of the tables, her father and mother approached us and sat down at the table with us. Immediately there was tension, tension that I was trying to ignore. Her mother spoke first, shaking my hand and greeting me, but her dad was much more straightforward and quickly got to the point.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna fit in here.‚Äù he said to me, to which I just let out a confused ‚Äúhuh?‚Äù

He repeated himself, which I then understood what he meant. He then said to me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not right for my daughter. Nothing you can do to change my thoughts. No offense, but you can‚Äôt understand what we go through.‚Äù

At his words I was a little shocked, and Jane started to protest. I stayed polite, but he soon said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop you two, but if you keep this going you‚Äôre not going to be welcome here, boy.‚Äù he said, standing with her mother and leaving the table.

Jane didn‚Äôt seem too surprised at his actions, which made me assume that this was expected. It would have been nice to have had a warning at least.

Moving on to a couple of days later, I had put in more thought to the situation. I liked Jane, but I didn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship where her parents would be so judgemental. Our relationship was only two months long, so I thought it would have been better to not prolong it and to just end it. With that being said, I took her out to a coffee shop and told her I needed to talk to her. There I explained that I was ending the relationship, not because of her but because of her parents. I explained that I just didn‚Äôt want to have a bad relationship with the parents of my girlfriend, and if they were going to base their view of me off of race, I wasn‚Äôt going to keep things going.

Jane was genuinely furious at this, and pulled out an accusation that I didn‚Äôt expect. Suddenly, she said, a little too loudly, ‚ÄúWow. So you‚Äôre breaking up with me because of my black family?‚Äù I was shocked at her words and denied, but she wasn‚Äôt having it and stormed out.

She then texted me an hour later calling me racist, which is completely untrue. She then proceeded to post things on social media about how she interpreted the situation, tagging me and leading friends and family to reach out to me because of her accusation.

So, am I a racist a-hole for breaking off a relationship because of her family‚Äôs disapproval of my race?

I've been struggling with dry air in my home for months, and I finally decided to do something about it. After countless hours of research and testing different humidifiers, I wanted to share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat.

First off, let's be real - finding the right humidifier isn't as simple as grabbing the first one you see online. I learned this the hard way after wasting money on two different models that just didn't cut it for my needs.

Here's what I discovered really matters:

Room Size
This is crucial! I made the mistake of buying a small humidifier for my large living room. It was like trying to fill a swimming pool with a water gun. Make sure to measure your space and check the coverage area of the humidifier you're considering.

Runtime
If you're like me and hate refilling tanks constantly, look for models with larger water tanks. I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/humidifier that can run for 24+ hours without needing a refill.

Noise Level
My first humidifier sounded like a coffee maker having a breakdown. If you're sensitive to noise (especially for bedroom use), ultrasonic humidifiers are your best bet. They're practically silent.

Maintenance
Some humidifiers are a pain to clean. Look for ones with wide openings and removable parts. Trust me, you don't want to spend 30 minutes trying to clean hard-to-reach corners.

Smart Features
While not necessary, features like auto shut-off, humidity sensors, and remote control can make your life easier. I personally love being able to control my humidifier from my phone.

After trying several options, I finally found my perfect match at https://athometouch.com/humidifier. The selection there really helped me understand what features would work best for my lifestyle.

Quick Pro Tips:
- Use distilled water to prevent white dust
- Clean your humidifier weekly (I do it every Sunday)
- Place it at least 6 inches from walls
- Don't put it directly on wooden furniture

Budget-wise, expect to spend between $30-$150 depending on features and size. I'd say it's worth investing in a quality model rather than replacing cheap ones repeatedly.

Remember, the right humidifier can make a huge difference in your comfort level, sleep quality, and even help with those annoying static shocks during winter. Plus, my plants are thriving now!

I find with being happier, I also end up feeling more upset about smaller things. This has always been an issue for me, trying to find a balance between feeling everything and being completely destroyed by the bad bits or being totally numb to all of it, including the good. But with e I don't think it's as much of feeling more down as it is just feeling the sadness deeper. Just like I feel the happiness deeper. 

Anyways the event that got me thinking about this was when my entire iced coffee spilled before I got to even properly drink it and I was really tired already and had to just get back into work. I felt more upset by it for longer, but at the same time I also didn't feel as.... Cynical? About it? It sucked, but it wasn't like all hope is lost and the world hates me and I might as well just go dje in a hole. So while it *is* deeper upsetness, it's also (I think) a lot healthier. So yeah!

Other than that, j had 2 good proper meals today. I was going for 3, but then I fumbled dinner. Perhaps tomorrow (though I prolly won't have a proper breakfast tomorrow) 

Im also pretty sure I can get hurt easier. In the last week I've been hit in the shin/foot so hard I had to just sit down and recoup. And it could be mental health at the time of impact, but it also just hurt a lot more than I've really been hurt by stuff like that in karate before. Speaking of karate, I also got hit/pushed directly on the chest a couple times (mainly by my brother lol) and I'm very glad for the bit of padding the sports bra provides, but it also didn't hurt as much as I would have thought. 

Mkay, you remember you are amazing and awesome and also, drink water heheh

Help us out?","Hey, guys. So my friend (u/perkyclown) recently made a pretty wild declaration: he wants to be the next "" **Pride of PESU.""**

I know, I know. It's a bold move. He's not talking about being a topper or winning some major competition (though that'd be cool too). He wants to be the kind of legend you hear about in the corridors‚Äîthe person everyone knows and respects, for whatever reason.

Anyway, he's roped me in as his **""King's Hand""** to help him on this quest. Basically, I'm the hype man, strategist, and professional coffee-getter.

So, I'm turning to you all. What's the path to becoming a PESU legend?

* What's a truly legendary thing to do here?
* What's a hilarious or crazy challenge he should take on?
* What's the one thing that will solidify his reputation forever?

Any advice, tips, or funny ideas are welcome. I am looking for wisdom from the community. Let's make this happen.

‚ÄîCaleb

p.s. Here‚Äôs the first chapter to pique your interest:

# Chapter 1

Panic surged through me as I sprinted down the narrow, pitch-black stairwell, the cold concrete walls closing in on me. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel its presence‚Äîthe creature was close, just beyond the reach of the shadows. I had been working late, the only one left in the office, when it appeared. One moment, I was alone in blissful silence; the next, it came charging toward me from the darkness, its shape an undulating blur. I didn‚Äôt even have time to grab my phone, wallet, or keys‚Äîthey were left behind in the chaos of my escape. The others had come before, yes, but none of them had felt this dangerous. None had filled me with this level of terror.

As I descended the endless flights of stairs, a hollow, mechanical ticking began to grow louder, its rhythm maddeningly precise.¬†

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick... Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*¬†

It was like an old wind-up alarm clock‚Äîone of those vintage ones you find in dusty antique stores‚Äîonly this one had teeth. Its pulse vibrated through my bones, tied to my heartbeat, growing faster and more insistent with every step I took. I couldn‚Äôt outrun it, but I had to try.

I reached the bottom floor and slammed through the exit doors, gasping for breath. The cold midnight air slapped my face, biting into my skin. For a fleeting moment, I thought the chill might shock me into clarity, but the thought vanished as quickly as it had come. There was no time for relief.

I pushed forward, my legs aching with every step, my lungs screaming for air. My breath billowed in the cold, swirling before me like a mist, only to vanish into the darkness. My house was only a few miles away, but the thought of being so close, yet feeling so far from safety, gnawed at me. Would I make it there in time? Would I even make it there at all?

The streets were eerily quiet‚Äîempty. No cars. No people. Just the faint hum of the city in the distance, barely audible over the sound of my pounding heart. I sprinted past a deserted playground, its swings swaying gently in the wind. A child sat alone on one of the swings, their tiny legs kicking lazily back and forth. The creaking of the chains pierced the silence like a knife. I froze, my pulse spiking.

What was a child doing here, at this hour? Why were they alone, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere?

The child‚Äôs back was turned to me, their small form shrouded in darkness. I couldn‚Äôt make out their face, but I felt their presence‚Äîchill and hollow. They didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. They just stared somberly at the ground, as if waiting for something.

I tried to shake the unsettling familiarity creeping up my spine. I had seen that posture before‚Ä¶ but where? And why did it feel like I knew them?

The wind picked up, carrying a whisper through the air, barely audible over the pounding of my heart.

*""You always run, don‚Äôt you?""*

My breath hitched. The voice was small, yet it carried a weight far beyond its size. It slithered through my ears, sinking into my bones.

Was it just my imagination, or was the child actually speaking to me?

The shadows around them seemed to shift, stretching unnaturally, bending in ways that defied reason. The air grew thick, heavy‚Äîlike I was wading through something unseen. I took a hesitant step back, my foot scraping against the pavement.

The child‚Äôs head tilted ever so slightly. *Tick***.** A jolt ran through me.

The ticking was louder now, almost deafening. My pulse fought to keep up with the relentless beat.

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*

The ticking wasn‚Äôt just sound anymore‚Äîit was inside me, reverberating through my skull, shaking something loose. My vision wavered. The playground blurred, the cold night dissolving into something else‚Äîsomething older, buried beneath layers of time.""

The scent of fresh ink and stale coffee filled my nose. A distant murmur of voices swelled in my ears.

I blinked, and suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt running anymore.

I was back in the office.

The fluorescent lights buzzed above me, the air thick with the sharp scent of freshly printed reports. It all felt strangely distant, like I was seeing it from a place I could no longer reach. I watched myself, just a year ago, walking through those same sterile doors for the first time. I had been so sure, so full of hope, convinced I could carve out a place for myself, that I could fit in.

But that was before I realized how different I really was. My coworkers had their cliques, their routines, their unspoken rules. I was just‚Ä¶ there. An outsider. I tried so hard to belong‚Äîsmall talk by the coffee machine, trying to memorize their names and faces, but each day I felt more invisible. The empty smiles, the awkward silences when I spoke‚Äîevery gesture felt rehearsed, as if they were all just going through motions I couldn‚Äôt quite grasp. And then I started doing things differently. Trying to break out of the mold. Offering help when they didn‚Äôt ask for it. Showing up with donuts, but no one seemed to care.

The more I reached out, the more distant they became. I wasn‚Äôt part of their world. I was an intruder.

Maybe that‚Äôs when it started‚Äîwhen the thing that seemed to be hunting me first sank its claws in. I didn‚Äôt know it then, but everything‚Äîthe isolation, the weight of my own frustration‚Äîwas feeding it. It was growing, feeding on my doubts, my loneliness, turning them into something real, something tangible.

Still, over time, things began to change. Slowly, I found myself connecting with a few people in the office, and the crushing loneliness started to fade. I began to feel like I was fitting in, like I was finally carving out a small place for myself in the chaos. Small talk at the coffee machine didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore; it was real. I laughed, I was heard. It was a fragile thing, this sense of belonging, but for a while, it felt like maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI had earned a spot in their world.

But it was always just that‚Äîfragile. Delicate, like a thread that could snap at any moment. It was in the way they looked past me when I wasn‚Äôt speaking, or the way conversations would fall quiet when I entered the room, as if I was an afterthought. I had my place, yes, but I also knew it could disappear just as quickly.

Just when I thought I was finally easing into the rhythm of things, something‚Äîor rather, someone‚Äîcame along to shatter that delicate balance. The company hired a new guy‚Äîfresh-faced, polished, confident‚Äîa stark reminder of everything I wasn‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt matter that I‚Äôd finally found my way; the moment he walked through that door, my fragile peace unraveled. It was as if the room shifted, the air became heavier, and every interaction was suddenly refracted through the lens of his presence. The office rallied around him instantly‚Äîlike he was the answer to some unsaid question, the missing piece everyone had been waiting for.

And me? I was just a spectator again. The connections I‚Äôd worked so hard to build? Gone. The fragile sense of inclusion I‚Äôd clung to, now slipping through my fingers like sand. The emptiness came back in full force.

When I first saw him, my stomach soured, and I heard the first faint *Tick.*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe they hired *this* guy‚Ä¶‚Äù*Tick‚Ä¶*‚ÄúHe probably had his rich parents pull strings to get him the job‚Ä¶‚Äù*Tick‚Ä¶*

I broke him down in my mind, pinpointing everything I didn‚Äôt like about him. From his personality to his pretty-boy smile, everything irked me about him. The whole office flocked around him like he was some sort of celebrity‚Äîyet on my first day, they treated me like I was invisible. I couldn‚Äôt understand what made this guy better than me, but then I overheard one of my coworkers say that he transferred from another branch and that upper management was grooming him to take over the new project manager position. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîthis guy was not just a threat to my social standing, but to my career as well. The last thing I wanted was for him to give me orders. Simply put, I hated him‚Ä¶

Over the next couple of weeks, I became consumed by thoughts of him. I watched his every move, listened to his every conversation. Forced to attend meetings with him, I couldn‚Äôt help but observe how he charmed the higher-ups‚Äîand it made me sick. He lied through his teeth, spun flimsy excuses for his mistakes, and dumped his workload on me with impossible deadlines. After a month of this, bitterness grew inside me. It felt like nothing I did mattered‚Äîthe spotlight was always on him. From the depths of my heart, I longed for someone‚Äî*anyone!*‚Äîto recognize and appreciate my work. But no‚Ä¶ in the end, ‚ÄúI‚Äù didn‚Äôt matter. I often asked myself, *Why did he get everything while I got nothing?*

Resentment consumed me, and my frustrations began to spill over beyond him. Hatred burned inside me, and I unleashed it on anyone I perceived as weaker. From road rage to getting impatient at the grocery store, it felt like everything inconvenienced my already fragile happiness.

One night, I got so worked up that I couldn‚Äôt sleep. So, I turned on a movie, hoping that exhaustion would take over. But as I mindlessly watched the screen, my ears suddenly began to burn. At first, I thought nothing of it, but soon, they felt as though they were being seared by an oven.

Minutes later, my right ear felt like it was on fire. I reached up to feel it‚Äîand to my horror, my fingers brushed against something soft and furry. Panic surged through me. I scrambled off the couch, knocking the thing off my shoulder. I turned in time to see a small creature bounce off the cushion.

I froze, bewildered, as I took in its strange features. It was about a foot tall, with a round, plump body like a penguin. It had big, floppy ears and a mischievous glint in its eyes. Its sleek silver fur shimmered in the dim light, and a little golden bow adorned its hair.

As I stared at it, my left ear continued to burn. Slowly, I turned my head, only to find an identical creature now perched on my other shoulder. This one had thick golden fur and the same bow, but this one was silver. I reached out to grab it, but the moment my fingers made contact with its soft, pudgy body, it tightened its grip on my ear.

Desperate to dislodge it, I clutched it tighter. After a few moments of struggle, it broke free, landing next to its twin on the couch. The two creatures stood side by side, exchanging a glance before turning their eyes back to me.

They began chanting in unison, their voices so quiet that I could barely make out the words. Cautiously, I knelt down and leaned in, trying not to make any sudden movements in case they went for my ears again. And then, I heard it‚Äîthe faint sound:

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*

A chill crawled up my spine as goosebumps spread across my arms. I couldn‚Äôt process what I was seeing and hearing‚Äîit felt like a dream. I frantically scanned the room for something to contain them and remembered an old birdcage in the basement. I grabbed the creatures, rushed downstairs, and locked them in the cage. Their whispers continued:

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*

The sound was unsettling, and with every tick, my shoulders grew heavier, more tense. ‚ÄúWhat were these creatures? Where did they come from? Why did they make my ears burn?‚Äù No answers came, only more questions.

The encounter left me jittery and on edge. I hated that they‚Äôd been resting on my shoulders without me even knowing it. If it hadn‚Äôt been for the burning in my ears, I would have never known they were there. In a daze, I went to the kitchen and glanced at the clock on the oven: *1:02 a.m.*

Too nervous to sleep, I grabbed a bottle of wine, bypassing the glass, and drank straight from the bottle. Alcohol had always helped calm my restless mind. Before long, I was drunk and passed out on the couch, blissfully unaware of what awaited me next.

1nu1vn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1nu1vn0/i_should_just_let_you_live/,I should just let you live.,"I understand your perspective. Why would you want to be with someone who had another relationship in front of your face after you broke up? Why would you want to be with someone who gets angry and hot-headed in an argument? Why would you want to be with someone who isn‚Äôt ready to settle down just yet? I was sort of hoping that you would want me regardless, just because it was me.

I think when you love someone, the best thing you can give them is grace. I learned that from being with you. There are superficial things about you that I might have called ‚Äúdealbreakers‚Äù or ‚Äúred flags,‚Äù but when you really love somebody, those things are just a part of who they are. You accept them, and you work around them. I hated that I‚Äôd never seen you cook a meal, but I always laughed when I‚Äôd open your fridge and see nothing but sparkling water and a lone yogurt container. Part of me hated how much you worked while another part of me admired how smart, dedicated, and respected you were. I loved these things because they were familiar, and it meant that I knew you. I understood you.¬†

If I could have asked you for anything it would be to give me grace. I‚Äôm not as good at this as you are. I don‚Äôt have as much practice. I can‚Äôt always drown my emotions and turn them into rational thoughts. Sometimes I shut down and need time to process things, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that I‚Äôm avoiding them. I‚Äôm sorry about that.¬†

I‚Äôm also angry. I‚Äôm angry for what I extended to you, and what I never got in return. I have grievances, and I want you to understand things from my perspective.

I made it clear within the first month that I couldn‚Äôt handle less than a relationship. I made it clear in the second month that a relationship wasn‚Äôt ordering takeout, watching movies, and fucking on the couch every single day. I wanted to go places, to live life with another person. I made it clear in the third month that when you were away, I missed you and I wanted to be with you. I was met with icy cynicism and words that felt more like obligations than a true ‚ÄúI miss you, too.‚Äù I waited a month for you to come back, and I called you to find you drunk, incoherent, and more willing to jerk off on FaceTime rather than tell me that you missed me. I have 6 voicemails that you don‚Äôt remember sending saved in my phone, when you told me you loved me and I played them more times than I‚Äôd like to admit because it was the only time you ever said those words.¬†

I never wanted to be your house cat. I felt constrained, stressed, ashamed, and anxious, and I was always waiting for you to come home and give me the attention I was craving. I watched you go on trips by yourself, I heard stories about impulsive 4 hour drives to go surf in North Carolina, and I always wondered why you couldn‚Äôt drive the both of us to Maryland or somewhere else in the city, where no one would know us. I watched you be selfish and I wished I could be as selfish as you. I wish I didn‚Äôt put so much pressure on Christmas gifts you never got me or the Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner we never had. I just wanted you to show me, just once, that you could be my partner without having to be asked to do so.¬†

I understand that none of this matters now. I am excited for the day when I look at you and I feel nothing, and laugh at the fact that I was 24 years old and thought for a second that my life with you could ever work. Or that my life with you was even something I really wanted. I can‚Äôt wait to feel nothing. But today isn‚Äôt that day, and I feel absolutely everything.¬†

I can‚Äôt get a read on you. I can never tell if you truly care, or if you liked having sex with me more than you liked me. Sometimes I convince myself that you are secretly in love with me, but then I remember all of my grievances and I think that a person who was in love with me would have tried harder. I know you care, but I wish you cared more.¬†

My biggest regret with us is that so much of it was preventable. Why didn‚Äôt we drive to Annapolis or Baltimore on a Saturday? Why did we care so much about what people would think? Why couldn‚Äôt we have walked to get bagels and coffee in the morning? Why couldn‚Äôt we have gone somewhere for a weekend? Why wasn‚Äôt I worth any investment?

I was trying to tell you this when I came over. But everything you said killed me and I couldn‚Äôt get the words out. I wanted to be soft and tell you all of the things I loved about you, and tell you that in 5 years I would be willing to get pregnant and be married if you‚Äôd just give me a little time. I wanted to tell you that I loved you more than I‚Äôve loved any other man because when I‚Äôm with you I don‚Äôt feel alone, I feel like I‚Äôm with my friend. I wanted to let you know that I could sit on the couch and watch movies with you for the rest of my life because I love talking to you and I love hearing what you think about things. I wanted to tell you that we could do things differently and I would be better, because I would finally feel safe and secure. I never got to feel that way with you.¬†

I know none of this matters anymore, but I can‚Äôt keep crying in the shower and daydreaming about vengefully breaking your sliding glass doors anymore than I already am. I need you to know my perspective because I never got enough time to get my words together. I had to be alone, first.¬†

As I descended the endless flights of stairs, a hollow, mechanical ticking began to grow louder, its rhythm maddeningly precise.¬†

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick... Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*¬†

It was like an old wind-up alarm clock‚Äîone of those vintage ones you find in dusty antique stores‚Äîonly this one had teeth. Its pulse vibrated through my bones, tied to my heartbeat, growing faster and more insistent with every step I took. I couldn‚Äôt outrun it, but I had to try.

I reached the bottom floor and slammed through the exit doors, gasping for breath. The cold midnight air slapped my face, biting into my skin. For a fleeting moment, I thought the chill might shock me into clarity, but the thought vanished as quickly as it had come. There was no time for relief.

I pushed forward, my legs aching with every step, my lungs screaming for air. My breath billowed in the cold, swirling before me like a mist, only to vanish into the darkness. My house was only a few miles away, but the thought of being so close, yet feeling so far from safety, gnawed at me. Would I make it there in time? Would I even make it there at all?

The streets were eerily quiet‚Äîempty. No cars. No people. Just the faint hum of the city in the distance, barely audible over the sound of my pounding heart. I sprinted past a deserted playground, its swings swaying gently in the wind. A child sat alone on one of the swings, their tiny legs kicking lazily back and forth. The creaking of the chains pierced the silence like a knife. I froze, my pulse spiking.

What was a child doing here, at this hour? Why were they alone, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere?

The child‚Äôs back was turned to me, their small form shrouded in darkness. I couldn‚Äôt make out their face, but I felt their presence‚Äîchill and hollow. They didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. They just stared somberly at the ground, as if waiting for something.

I tried to shake the unsettling familiarity creeping up my spine. I had seen that posture before‚Ä¶ but where? And why did it feel like I knew them?

The wind picked up, carrying a whisper through the air, barely audible over the pounding of my heart.

*""You always run, don‚Äôt you?""*

My breath hitched. The voice was small, yet it carried a weight far beyond its size. It slithered through my ears, sinking into my bones.

Was it just my imagination, or was the child actually speaking to me?

The shadows around them seemed to shift, stretching unnaturally, bending in ways that defied reason. The air grew thick, heavy‚Äîlike I was wading through something unseen. I took a hesitant step back, my foot scraping against the pavement.

The child‚Äôs head tilted ever so slightly. *Tick***.** A jolt ran through me.

The ticking was louder now, almost deafening. My pulse fought to keep up with the relentless beat.

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*

The ticking wasn‚Äôt just sound anymore‚Äîit was inside me, reverberating through my skull, shaking something loose. My vision wavered. The playground blurred, the cold night dissolving into something else‚Äîsomething older, buried beneath layers of time.""

The scent of fresh ink and stale coffee filled my nose. A distant murmur of voices swelled in my ears.

I blinked, and suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt running anymore.

I was back in the office.

The fluorescent lights buzzed above me, the air thick with the sharp scent of freshly printed reports. It all felt strangely distant, like I was seeing it from a place I could no longer reach. I watched myself, just a year ago, walking through those same sterile doors for the first time. I had been so sure, so full of hope, convinced I could carve out a place for myself, that I could fit in.

But that was before I realized how different I really was. My coworkers had their cliques, their routines, their unspoken rules. I was just‚Ä¶ there. An outsider. I tried so hard to belong‚Äîsmall talk by the coffee machine, trying to memorize their names and faces, but each day I felt more invisible. The empty smiles, the awkward silences when I spoke‚Äîevery gesture felt rehearsed, as if they were all just going through motions I couldn‚Äôt quite grasp. And then I started doing things differently. Trying to break out of the mold. Offering help when they didn‚Äôt ask for it. Showing up with donuts, but no one seemed to care.

The more I reached out, the more distant they became. I wasn‚Äôt part of their world. I was an intruder.

Maybe that‚Äôs when it started‚Äîwhen the thing that seemed to be hunting me first sank its claws in. I didn‚Äôt know it then, but everything‚Äîthe isolation, the weight of my own frustration‚Äîwas feeding it. It was growing, feeding on my doubts, my loneliness, turning them into something real, something tangible.

Still, over time, things began to change. Slowly, I found myself connecting with a few people in the office, and the crushing loneliness started to fade. I began to feel like I was fitting in, like I was finally carving out a small place for myself in the chaos. Small talk at the coffee machine didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore; it was real. I laughed, I was heard. It was a fragile thing, this sense of belonging, but for a while, it felt like maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI had earned a spot in their world.

But it was always just that‚Äîfragile. Delicate, like a thread that could snap at any moment. It was in the way they looked past me when I wasn‚Äôt speaking, or the way conversations would fall quiet when I entered the room, as if I was an afterthought. I had my place, yes, but I also knew it could disappear just as quickly.

Just when I thought I was finally easing into the rhythm of things, something‚Äîor rather, someone‚Äîcame along to shatter that delicate balance. The company hired a new guy‚Äîfresh-faced, polished, confident‚Äîa stark reminder of everything I wasn‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt matter that I‚Äôd finally found my way; the moment he walked through that door, my fragile peace unraveled. It was as if the room shifted, the air became heavier, and every interaction was suddenly refracted through the lens of his presence. The office rallied around him instantly‚Äîlike he was the answer to some unsaid question, the missing piece everyone had been waiting for.

And me? I was just a spectator again. The connections I‚Äôd worked so hard to build? Gone. The fragile sense of inclusion I‚Äôd clung to, now slipping through my fingers like sand. The emptiness came back in full force.

When I first saw him, my stomach soured, and I heard the first faint *Tick.*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe they hired *this* guy‚Ä¶‚Äù*Tick‚Ä¶*‚ÄúHe probably had his rich parents pull strings to get him the job‚Ä¶‚Äù*Tick‚Ä¶*

I broke him down in my mind, pinpointing everything I didn‚Äôt like about him. From his personality to his pretty-boy smile, everything irked me about him. The whole office flocked around him like he was some sort of celebrity‚Äîyet on my first day, they treated me like I was invisible. I couldn‚Äôt understand what made this guy better than me, but then I overheard one of my coworkers say that he transferred from another branch and that upper management was grooming him to take over the new project manager position. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîthis guy was not just a threat to my social standing, but to my career as well. The last thing I wanted was for him to give me orders. Simply put, I hated him‚Ä¶

Over the next couple of weeks, I became consumed by thoughts of him. I watched his every move, listened to his every conversation. Forced to attend meetings with him, I couldn‚Äôt help but observe how he charmed the higher-ups‚Äîand it made me sick. He lied through his teeth, spun flimsy excuses for his mistakes, and dumped his workload on me with impossible deadlines. After a month of this, bitterness grew inside me. It felt like nothing I did mattered‚Äîthe spotlight was always on him. From the depths of my heart, I longed for someone‚Äî*anyone!*‚Äîto recognize and appreciate my work. But no‚Ä¶ in the end, ‚ÄúI‚Äù didn‚Äôt matter. I often asked myself, *Why did he get everything while I got nothing?*

Resentment consumed me, and my frustrations began to spill over beyond him. Hatred burned inside me, and I unleashed it on anyone I perceived as weaker. From road rage to getting impatient at the grocery store, it felt like everything inconvenienced my already fragile happiness.

One night, I got so worked up that I couldn‚Äôt sleep. So, I turned on a movie, hoping that exhaustion would take over. But as I mindlessly watched the screen, my ears suddenly began to burn. At first, I thought nothing of it, but soon, they felt as though they were being seared by an oven.

Minutes later, my right ear felt like it was on fire. I reached up to feel it‚Äîand to my horror, my fingers brushed against something soft and furry. Panic surged through me. I scrambled off the couch, knocking the thing off my shoulder. I turned in time to see a small creature bounce off the cushion.

I froze, bewildered, as I took in its strange features. It was about a foot tall, with a round, plump body like a penguin. It had big, floppy ears and a mischievous glint in its eyes. Its sleek silver fur shimmered in the dim light, and a little golden bow adorned its hair.

As I stared at it, my left ear continued to burn. Slowly, I turned my head, only to find an identical creature now perched on my other shoulder. This one had thick golden fur and the same bow, but this one was silver. I reached out to grab it, but the moment my fingers made contact with its soft, pudgy body, it tightened its grip on my ear.

Desperate to dislodge it, I clutched it tighter. After a few moments of struggle, it broke free, landing next to its twin on the couch. The two creatures stood side by side, exchanging a glance before turning their eyes back to me.

They began chanting in unison, their voices so quiet that I could barely make out the words. Cautiously, I knelt down and leaned in, trying not to make any sudden movements in case they went for my ears again. And then, I heard it‚Äîthe faint sound:

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*

A chill crawled up my spine as goosebumps spread across my arms. I couldn‚Äôt process what I was seeing and hearing‚Äîit felt like a dream. I frantically scanned the room for something to contain them and remembered an old birdcage in the basement. I grabbed the creatures, rushed downstairs, and locked them in the cage. Their whispers continued:

*Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶*

The sound was unsettling, and with every tick, my shoulders grew heavier, more tense. ‚ÄúWhat were these creatures? Where did they come from? Why did they make my ears burn?‚Äù No answers came, only more questions.

The encounter left me jittery and on edge. I hated that they‚Äôd been resting on my shoulders without me even knowing it. If it hadn‚Äôt been for the burning in my ears, I would have never known they were there. In a daze, I went to the kitchen and glanced at the clock on the oven: *1:02 a.m.*

Too nervous to sleep, I grabbed a bottle of wine, bypassing the glass, and drank straight from the bottle. Alcohol had always helped calm my restless mind. Before long, I was drunk and passed out on the couch, blissfully unaware of what awaited me next.

Nearly no sober woman wants you to walk up to her and ask to make out immediately, and this confuses men who see videos of guys asking for a kiss from a bunch of women in public and getting a ‚Äúno‚Äù. This is generally how I‚Äôd picture it going for someone I‚Äôve never talked to before:

- be sober in a social area where other people are hanging out talking

- probably be pleasant, chatty, and obviously outgoing with her, and not others (never hit on more than one person lmao, some people mess up badly here)

- don‚Äôt ‚Äúbreak the touch barrier‚Äù. Verbal consent only.

- chat with her for a while to simply build up some familiarity and convince her she‚Äôs not on a TikTok video being recorded lmao. Maybe in the range of 20 minutes to 2 hours. 

- have some amount of tact, buildup, and discretion. Spend time one on one with her. Tell her she looks great, is gorgeous, or something to indicate interest (just one compliment, not a bunch of them). Pay a lot of attention to if she doesn‚Äôt seem eager to spend time alone or 1 on 1 with you, because that usually means ‚Äúno‚Äù. Verbally declining whatever invitation I brought up also means ‚Äúno‚Äù. If she doesn‚Äôt seem like she wants to reschedule something ‚Äúa later time‚Äù, then of course that‚Äôs also a ‚Äúno‚Äù. ‚ÄúI have a boyfriend‚Äù is an instant ‚Äúno‚Äù. I generally don‚Äôt only ask for a number. 

Depending on the situation, I‚Äôd recommend either:

- inviting her to hang out (maybe the right choice for a friend you‚Äôre interested in from a friend group?)

- invite her out to volunteer to give you more time to see if she likes you (also, so you can volunteer more, it‚Äôs good for your dating life anyway)

- ask her if she‚Äôs single, or have a friend ask her if she‚Äôs single

- inviting her out for coffee or whatever date works for you

- inviting her back to your place (this is basically for a hookup)

- telling her you want to kiss her (probably only do this if you‚Äôre alone in a secluded place and she seems to like you)

- if something gets planned and you just met her, then probably just give her your number. Some women will be inclined to give out a fake number, but giving her yours will likely simplify things to make her more comfortable. 

tl;dr: chat -> get her alone or 1:1 with you -> chat -> compliment -> chat -> invite out for what you want -> accept answer. Accept ‚Äúno‚Äù at any of these steps as a likely sign they‚Äôre not interested",1,1759200386.0,PurplePillDebate,37,0.67,False

P.S. Here is a teaser to pique your interest:

# Chapter 1

 Panic surged through me as I sprinted down the narrow, pitch-black stairwell, the cold concrete walls closing in on me. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel its presence‚Äîthe creature was close, just beyond the reach of the shadows. I had been working late, the only one left in the office, when it appeared. One moment, I was alone in blissful silence; the next, it came charging toward me from the darkness, its shape an undulating blur. I didn‚Äôt even have time to grab my phone, wallet, or keys‚Äîthey were left behind in the chaos of my escape. The others had come before, yes, but none of them had felt this dangerous. None had filled me with this level of terror.

The encounter left me jittery and on edge. I hated that they‚Äôd been resting on my shoulders without me even knowing it. If it hadn‚Äôt been for the burning in my ears, I would have never known they were there. In a daze, I went to the kitchen and glanced at the clock on the oven: 1:02 a.m.

Too nervous to sleep, I grabbed a bottle of wine, bypassing the glass, and drank straight from the bottle. Alcohol had always helped calm my restless mind. Before long, I was drunk and passed out on the couch, blissfully unaware of what awaited me next.

P.S. Here is a teaser to pique your interest:

# Chapter 1

 Panic surged through me as I sprinted down the narrow, pitch-black stairwell, the cold concrete walls closing in on me. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel its presence‚Äîthe creature was close, just beyond the reach of the shadows. I had been working late, the only one left in the office, when it appeared. One moment, I was alone in blissful silence; the next, it came charging toward me from the darkness, its shape an undulating blur. I didn‚Äôt even have time to grab my phone, wallet, or keys‚Äîthey were left behind in the chaos of my escape. The others had come before, yes, but none of them had felt this dangerous. None had filled me with this level of terror.

As I descended the endless flights of stairs, a hollow, mechanical ticking began to grow louder, its rhythm maddeningly precise.¬†

Tick‚Ä¶ Tick... Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶¬†

It was like an old wind-up alarm clock‚Äîone of those vintage ones you find in dusty antique stores‚Äîonly this one had teeth. Its pulse vibrated through my bones, tied to my heartbeat, growing faster and more insistent with every step I took. I couldn‚Äôt outrun it, but I had to try.

I reached the bottom floor and slammed through the exit doors, gasping for breath. The cold midnight air slapped my face, biting into my skin. For a fleeting moment, I thought the chill might shock me into clarity, but the thought vanished as quickly as it had come. There was no time for relief.

I pushed forward, my legs aching with every step, my lungs screaming for air. My breath billowed in the cold, swirling before me like a mist, only to vanish into the darkness. My house was only a few miles away, but the thought of being so close, yet feeling so far from safety, gnawed at me. Would I make it there in time? Would I even make it there at all?

The streets were eerily quiet‚Äîempty. No cars. No people. Just the faint hum of the city in the distance, barely audible over the sound of my pounding heart. I sprinted past a deserted playground, its swings swaying gently in the wind. A child sat alone on one of the swings, their tiny legs kicking lazily back and forth. The creaking of the chains pierced the silence like a knife. I froze, my pulse spiking.

What was a child doing here, at this hour? Why were they alone, in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere?

The child‚Äôs back was turned to me, their small form shrouded in darkness. I couldn‚Äôt make out their face, but I felt their presence‚Äîchill and hollow. They didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt acknowledge me. They just stared somberly at the ground, as if waiting for something.

I tried to shake the unsettling familiarity creeping up my spine. I had seen that posture before‚Ä¶ but where? And why did it feel like I knew them?

The wind picked up, carrying a whisper through the air, barely audible over the pounding of my heart.

""You always run, don‚Äôt you?""

My breath hitched. The voice was small, yet it carried a weight far beyond its size. It slithered through my ears, sinking into my bones.

Was it just my imagination, or was the child actually speaking to me?

The shadows around them seemed to shift, stretching unnaturally, bending in ways that defied reason. The air grew thick, heavy‚Äîlike I was wading through something unseen. I took a hesitant step back, my foot scraping against the pavement.

The child‚Äôs head tilted ever so slightly. Tick. A jolt ran through me.

The ticking was louder now, almost deafening. My pulse fought to keep up with the relentless beat.

Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶

The ticking wasn‚Äôt just sound anymore‚Äîit was inside me, reverberating through my skull, shaking something loose. My vision wavered. The playground blurred, the cold night dissolving into something else‚Äîsomething older, buried beneath layers of time.""

The scent of fresh ink and stale coffee filled my nose. A distant murmur of voices swelled in my ears.

I blinked, and suddenly, I wasn‚Äôt running anymore.

I was back in the office.

The fluorescent lights buzzed above me, the air thick with the sharp scent of freshly printed reports. It all felt strangely distant, like I was seeing it from a place I could no longer reach. I watched myself, just a year ago, walking through those same sterile doors for the first time. I had been so sure, so full of hope, convinced I could carve out a place for myself, that I could fit in.

But that was before I realized how different I really was. My coworkers had their cliques, their routines, their unspoken rules. I was just‚Ä¶ there. An outsider. I tried so hard to belong‚Äîsmall talk by the coffee machine, trying to memorize their names and faces, but each day I felt more invisible. The empty smiles, the awkward silences when I spoke‚Äîevery gesture felt rehearsed, as if they were all just going through motions I couldn‚Äôt quite grasp. And then I started doing things differently. Trying to break out of the mold. Offering help when they didn‚Äôt ask for it. Showing up with donuts, but no one seemed to care.

The more I reached out, the more distant they became. I wasn‚Äôt part of their world. I was an intruder.

Maybe that‚Äôs when it started‚Äîwhen the thing that seemed to be hunting me first sank its claws in. I didn‚Äôt know it then, but everything‚Äîthe isolation, the weight of my own frustration‚Äîwas feeding it. It was growing, feeding on my doubts, my loneliness, turning them into something real, something tangible.

Still, over time, things began to change. Slowly, I found myself connecting with a few people in the office, and the crushing loneliness started to fade. I began to feel like I was fitting in, like I was finally carving out a small place for myself in the chaos. Small talk at the coffee machine didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore; it was real. I laughed, I was heard. It was a fragile thing, this sense of belonging, but for a while, it felt like maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI had earned a spot in their world.

But it was always just that‚Äîfragile. Delicate, like a thread that could snap at any moment. It was in the way they looked past me when I wasn‚Äôt speaking, or the way conversations would fall quiet when I entered the room, as if I was an afterthought. I had my place, yes, but I also knew it could disappear just as quickly.

Just when I thought I was finally easing into the rhythm of things, something‚Äîor rather, someone‚Äîcame along to shatter that delicate balance. The company hired a new guy‚Äîfresh-faced, polished, confident‚Äîa stark reminder of everything I wasn‚Äôt. It didn‚Äôt matter that I‚Äôd finally found my way; the moment he walked through that door, my fragile peace unraveled. It was as if the room shifted, the air became heavier, and every interaction was suddenly refracted through the lens of his presence. The office rallied around him instantly‚Äîlike he was the answer to some unsaid question, the missing piece everyone had been waiting for.

And me? I was just a spectator again. The connections I‚Äôd worked so hard to build? Gone. The fragile sense of inclusion I‚Äôd clung to, now slipping through my fingers like sand. The emptiness came back in full force.

When I first saw him, my stomach soured, and I heard the first faint Tick.‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe they hired this guy‚Ä¶‚ÄùTick‚Ä¶‚ÄúHe probably had his rich parents pull strings to get him the job‚Ä¶‚ÄùTick‚Ä¶

I broke him down in my mind, pinpointing everything I didn‚Äôt like about him. From his personality to his pretty-boy smile, everything irked me about him. The whole office flocked around him like he was some sort of celebrity‚Äîyet on my first day, they treated me like I was invisible. I couldn‚Äôt understand what made this guy better than me, but then I overheard one of my coworkers say that he transferred from another branch and that upper management was grooming him to take over the new project manager position. That‚Äôs when it hit me‚Äîthis guy was not just a threat to my social standing, but to my career as well. The last thing I wanted was for him to give me orders. Simply put, I hated him‚Ä¶

Over the next couple of weeks, I became consumed by thoughts of him. I watched his every move, listened to his every conversation. Forced to attend meetings with him, I couldn‚Äôt help but observe how he charmed the higher-ups‚Äîand it made me sick. He lied through his teeth, spun flimsy excuses for his mistakes, and dumped his workload on me with impossible deadlines. After a month of this, bitterness grew inside me. It felt like nothing I did mattered‚Äîthe spotlight was always on him. From the depths of my heart, I longed for someone‚Äîanyone!‚Äîto recognize and appreciate my work. But no‚Ä¶ in the end, ‚ÄúI‚Äù didn‚Äôt matter. I often asked myself, Why did he get everything while I got nothing?

Resentment consumed me, and my frustrations began to spill over beyond him. Hatred burned inside me, and I unleashed it on anyone I perceived as weaker. From road rage to getting impatient at the grocery store, it felt like everything inconvenienced my already fragile happiness.

One night, I got so worked up that I couldn‚Äôt sleep. So, I turned on a movie, hoping that exhaustion would take over. But as I mindlessly watched the screen, my ears suddenly began to burn. At first, I thought nothing of it, but soon, they felt as though they were being seared by an oven.

Minutes later, my right ear felt like it was on fire. I reached up to feel it‚Äîand to my horror, my fingers brushed against something soft and furry. Panic surged through me. I scrambled off the couch, knocking the thing off my shoulder. I turned in time to see a small creature bounce off the cushion.

I froze, bewildered, as I took in its strange features. It was about a foot tall, with a round, plump body like a penguin. It had big, floppy ears and a mischievous glint in its eyes. Its sleek silver fur shimmered in the dim light, and a little golden bow adorned its hair.

As I stared at it, my left ear continued to burn. Slowly, I turned my head, only to find an identical creature now perched on my other shoulder. This one had thick golden fur and the same bow, but this one was silver. I reached out to grab it, but the moment my fingers made contact with its soft, pudgy body, it tightened its grip on my ear.

Desperate to dislodge it, I clutched it tighter. After a few moments of struggle, it broke free, landing next to its twin on the couch. The two creatures stood side by side, exchanging a glance before turning their eyes back to me.

They began chanting in unison, their voices so quiet that I could barely make out the words. Cautiously, I knelt down and leaned in, trying not to make any sudden movements in case they went for my ears again. And then, I heard it‚Äîthe faint sound:

Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶

A chill crawled up my spine as goosebumps spread across my arms. I couldn‚Äôt process what I was seeing and hearing‚Äîit felt like a dream. I frantically scanned the room for something to contain them and remembered an old birdcage in the basement. I grabbed the creatures, rushed downstairs, and locked them in the cage. Their whispers continued:

Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶Tick‚Ä¶ Tick‚Ä¶

The sound was unsettling, and with every tick, my shoulders grew heavier, more tense. ‚ÄúWhat were these creatures? Where did they come from? Why did they make my ears burn?‚Äù No answers came, only more questions.

The encounter left me jittery and on edge. I hated that they‚Äôd been resting on my shoulders without me even knowing it. If it hadn‚Äôt been for the burning in my ears, I would have never known they were there. In a daze, I went to the kitchen and glanced at the clock on the oven: 1:02 a.m.

I told her that wasn‚Äôt true, and that I‚Äôd be contacting UberEats. She started yelling that the stickers peeled off on their own. I just hung up.

I am a veteran and this project is made by veterans for veterans. It‚Äôs grassroots and not for profit.

I‚Äôm working on starting up a veterans community garden in my town, and I‚Äôd love to get some feedback from other vets on what would actually make this worth showing up for and give it the value we need in an outdoor space.

The idea started because I kept running into other vets like myself who wanted to garden but didn‚Äôt have space. I was growing stuff in pots, wanted more room, but couldn‚Äôt afford it. The local community garden is great, but honestly I don‚Äôt have a lot in common with most of the people there and I just feel exposed. Around here the only real option to hang out with vets is the VFW or Legion. Nothing against them, but it wasn‚Äôt the space I was looking for. So I thought, what if we had a simple garden where vets could dig in the dirt, grow some food, and hang out together.

I don‚Äôt own land, so I went down the rabbit hole. I asked myself, ‚Äúhow do I get land to garden for free.‚Äù Eventually I found a veteran forward nonprofit that agreed to give me and my crazy ideas into a fiscal sponsorship, which opens the door to grants. Since then things have snowballed with support. Local veteran owned businesses are helping where they can, I‚Äôve got an agriculture teacher advising (because I‚Äôm no expert), and even local media picked it up (I refused a video intervieww because I‚Äôm a special flavor of paranoid crazy I guess‚Ä¶). We‚Äôve already had donations offered, including deer fencing, wood chips, labor, and a 12x20 timber frame pavilion for classes and vegetable production. On top of that, more partnerships keep rolling in. People really want to help make this happen, which is surprisingly surprising!

I‚Äôve had a few offers of land but need something closer to town. I know I can‚Äôt be picky hahahahahha!

I know there are similar projects out there, but I envision this as kind of an outdoor VFW or Legion except quieter, healthier, and focused on learning and community. I have researched and reached out to those programs.

Here‚Äôs the vision so far:

‚Ä¢ Each vet can have a bed or plot for the season if they want their own space ‚Ä¢ A communal space for vets who don‚Äôt want the responsibility of their own bed but still want the community ‚Ä¢ ADA accessible: raised beds, wide walkways, shaded areas, and vine screens for folks dealing with PTSD or photosensitivity ‚Ä¢ Workshops led by local educators: gardening, canning, bees, you name it ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBro stuff‚Äù like chili cook-offs, making salsa, movie nights, coffee mornings, and an earth oven ‚Ä¢ Anything grown in the communal area will go to elderly vets or be donated to the community ‚Ä¢ Family-friendly days with a small kids‚Äô play space so childcare isn‚Äôt a barrier ‚Ä¢ Community days where the public can join in since it‚Äôll be ADA accessible ‚Ä¢ A therapeutic space that could also support alternative therapies or just quiet time

But here‚Äôs where I need help:

‚Ä¢ What am I not thinking about? I‚Äôve thought about PTSD, bad backs, mobility, TBI and photosensitivity, and making it ADA friendly. But what else could keep someone from wanting to be in a garden like this ‚Ä¢ If you had a unique situation that made gardening tough, what accommodations would help ‚Ä¢ Beyond that, what would make you actually want to show up to something like this

I‚Äôm also tying this into the VA‚Äôs Whole Health program. The idea is that the outpatient clinic here could work together. For example the physical therapists could help vets tailor gardening routines, dietitians could reinforce healthy cooking and eating, and it could serve as a form of movement and passive horticulture therapy for mental health. It‚Äôs under review now, and my hope is if the VA health team sees value, maybe they will sign off on allowing the social workers to suggest it as an option. Why not align it with health and wellness while still doing chili cook-offs and letting the kids play in a sandbox hahahahaha!

As soon as we secure land, the agriculture advisor will start drafting plans for irrigation, pavilion, beds, and infrastructure. I want to make sure it‚Äôs as versatile and accessible a space as possible.

If any of you have skills you‚Äôd be willing to lend advice on like landscaping, design, web, marketing, organizing, or anything else I‚Äôd be super grateful. This isn‚Äôt for profit, I‚Äôm not asking for money, just knowledge, feedback, and guidance. I want to build the best space I can for us.

Thanks for reading, and for any advice you‚Äôre willing to share.

TLDR I‚Äôm a vet trying to start a community garden for veterans, a space with individual plots, a communal area, ADA accessibility, workshops, and family-friendly days. We‚Äôve got partnerships, donations (like fencing and a pavilion), and even the VA Whole Health program reviewing it. I need advice, what am I missing, what would make you actually want to use a space like this, and any skills, ideas, or guidance would mean a lot.",1,1759198899.0,u_VeteransGarden,1,1.0,False

1.Chapter 1 Her Shadow
Alicia Lawrence jolted awake. She glanced at the half-finished sketch on her desk and the familiar room around her. With a smile touching her lips, she realized she had really come back.

Her eyes fell on the calendar. Today marked three months since Tiffany Lawrence had returned to the family. It was also the very day that the whole family gathered to celebrate Tiffany's return. 'The timing couldn't be better,' Alicia thought, just as a knock sounded at the door.

Alicia opened the door to find her second-eldest brother, Andrew Lawrence, standing outside, frowning at her. ""Alicia, what's wrong with you? I knocked three times. I was starting to think you had died in there.""

At his curse-like words, Alicia simply stared back coldly, saying nothing. Her silence only made Andrew more impatient. ""Is that painting finished yet? Mr. West is arriving in Riverdale in a few days. Tiffany needs to bring it with her to ask him to be her mentor. Don't you dare mess this up for her.""

Alicia's perfectly shaped brows furrowed. ""I spent an entire week on that painting, barely sleeping or eating. Why should I just hand it over to Tiffany?""

Hearing this, Andrew stared at Alicia in disbelief. ""Are you running a fever? Is your brain fried? What nonsense are you talking about? Wasn't that painting always meant for Tiffany?""

He moved closer, voice sharp with impatience. ""If it's done, hand it over. Now. And have you finished anything else lately? I'm not criticizing, but your output is too low. Tiffany hasn't posted in a month. She'll be forgotten if this goes on. From now on, eat less, sleep less, and draw more. For her.""

Andrew said it like it was the most natural thing in the world. And Alicia knew it was her fault. She had spoiled them all in her past life, and now his entitlement was the price she had to pay.

In Alicia's past life, Tiffany was a famous online painter. Her works sold for high prices and won her many fans. Later, she even became a student of Edward West, a well-known painter. This helped her move from internet fame to real-world success, and she became a famous artist.

But no one knew the truth. Alicia had actually painted every piece Tiffany posted online as well as every painting Tiffany created as Edward West's student.

Alicia had been kept like a shadow by the Lawrence family, forced to paint endlessly, all to build Tiffany's career and ensure her success.

In her previous life, Alicia had craved the affection from the family and the love from her mother. Hoping for even the smallest bit of warmth from the Lawrences, she agreed to almost everything they asked, doing whatever was demanded of her.

But when Tiffany became famous, the family worried Alicia would cause trouble. So they locked Alicia in a dark room with chains. She could no longer tell day from night. Her life was reduced to eating, sleeping, and painting while chained. With no contact to the outside world, she could only paint from her mind, and her art became more and more abstract.

Tiffany accused Alicia of refusing to paint well on purpose. As punishment, she locked Alicia in the basement with dozens of starved rats and snakes. The hungry animals attacked and killed Alicia. Before she died, Alicia swore that if she ever had another chance, she would make the Lawrence family pay for what they did.

But after she died, she didn't go to the underworld. Instead, she met an old man with a white beard. He told her to finish nine tasks, and if she succeeded, she could go back to life. So she traveled through nine different worlds, helping the main characters and others achieve their deepest wishes. And now, she had finally returned.

This time, Alicia had no intention of putting up with the Lawrence family any longer. She would never let Tiffany become Edward West's student. So she stared coldly at Andrew and said, ""I painted it, and I won't give it to Tiffany.""

Andrew flew into a rage. ""Alicia, you owe everything to Tiffany. All these years, you've been living as her, enjoying the comfort and privilege of our family. That life should have been hers, but she was the one suffering outside. Now we're only asking you to paint a few pieces for her. What's so hard about that? Do you really think you've been wronged?""

That was true. Alicia wasn't the Lawrence family's real daughter. Twelve years ago, when she was just eight years old, the Lawrence family had forced her to come home with them.

At that time, the Lawrences' youngest daughter, Tiffany, had gone missing. Maria Lawrence was almost broken by grief. Then they found Alicia, who was about the same age as Tiffany. Missing her daughter terribly, Maria saw Tiffany in Alicia and insisted on bringing her home.

Alicia had always had a natural gift for painting. Even as a child, she could paint anything she saw. But without any real training, her work was more about feeling than technical skill.

Later, she met an old ragpicker named Richard Shaw. Richard was a skilled painter who noticed Alicia's love for art and took her in as his student. After a year of learning from Richard, Alicia's painting improved dramatically. She even began selling her work to earn money.

Every day, she would paint and sell her work. Some pieces sold for just a few dollars, others for a hundred or more. Together, she and Richard lived off what he made from collecting scraps and what she earned from her art.

They weren't greedy. The money they earned was enough to get by and even enough to help others. She remembered once even helping a boy in need. But then the Lawrence family came and took her away, forcing her to become their daughter.

Alicia had tried to run away many times to look for Richard, but she could never find him. When she was heartbroken, Maria told her, ""Richard doesn't want you anymore. From now on, the Lawrence house is your home, and we are your family.""

Back then, she was deeply touched. Having never had a family, and now left behind by Richard, she felt completely alone and even began to doubt herself. The Lawrences showed up just when she longed for a place to belong.

After becoming a Lawrence, Alicia did everything she was told and tried her best to behave. The Lawrences gave her a room, and she slowly settled into her new life.

But three months ago, the Lawrence family suddenly found their biological daughter, Tiffany. But Maria said, ""Alicia is also a child I raised with my own hands. I can't just send her away. Besides, she has nowhere else to go. She is welcome to stay with us.""

At that time, Alicia felt grateful to the Lawrences. She also felt sorry for Tiffany, who had been lost and suffered so much as a child. Because of this, she always tried to be kind to Tiffany. She thought she was gaining a sister, and that they would get along well. But things did not turn out as she had hoped.

From the day Tiffany returned, she was deeply hostile toward Alicia. When Alicia offered her food, she would secretly put laxatives in it. Then she accused Alicia of trying to poison her, claiming Alicia was afraid that she would take everything.

When Alicia gave her clothes, she hid needles inside, then pretended to cry and beg, ""Alicia, I won't compete with you. I just want to stay with Mom, Dad, and my brothers. Please, let me stay.""

The Lawrences saw Tiffany's pleading. They called Alicia cruel and showed even more sympathy toward Tiffany. They already believed Alicia had stolen Tiffany's identity and made her suffer for years. Now they were more certain than ever that Alicia owed Tiffany everything.

Whatever Tiffany wanted, the Lawrences would do anything to get it for her. And whatever Tiffany wanted was always something that belonged to Alicia. One by one, everything Alicia loved and cherished was robbed from her by Tiffany.

2.Chapter 2 Savior
'How stupid I was in my past life, always trying to make it up to Tiffany. Her getting lost had nothing to do with me. Why did I have to be the one to pay for it?' Alicia thought to herself.

She glared at Andrew and said coldly, ""First, I didn't make you lose Tiffany. Second, it was your mother who forced me to come here. She needed a girl around Tiffany's age to ease her pain. I owe Tiffany nothing. If anyone does, it's all of you.""

""There you go again with your tantrums. You know what we can't stand about you? It's this entitled attitude. Why can't you be sweet like Tiffany?"" Andrew snapped.

""Enough. I don't want to hear any more of your nonsense. Just hand over the painting to Tiffany. Once she's famous, I might even let you be her assistant."" He spoke as though he were granting Alicia some great favor.

'What a perfect plan. Making me Tiffany's assistant just means painting for her forever. It's exactly like my past life.' Alicia laughed coldly.

""If that assistant job is so great, let someone else have it. From now on, I won't do anything for Tiffany."" With that, she slammed the door shut.

Andrew stumbled backward, but not fast enough. The door still struck his nose. Rubbing the sore spot, he stared in disbelief. 'Is Alicia possessed? She has always been obedient. This is the first time she has ever refused.'

Then a strange feeling rose in his chest. 'Why did she say no? How dare she? She owes Tiffany everything.'

He kicked the door angrily. ""Alicia, listen to me. If you ruin this chance for Tiffany, Dad will throw you out of the house. You can go back to being a beggar on the street."" Having said that, he turned and stormed downstairs.

Alicia glanced around her shabby room, smiling sarcastically. Since she had joined the family, they had put her in this room and forgotten all about it. 'It's time to go. I've been given a second chance. I won't stay here and be their doormat anymore.'

The room held little that was truly hers: just the newly finished painting, a few pieces of clothing she secretly bought with her own money, and a debit card with her savings.

Throughout her years with the Lawrences, Alicia had supported herself, without receiving even a cent from the family. She bought her own clothes, made her own meals, and was mostly forgotten by the family.

The only time they noticed her was when Maria missed Tiffany and remembered she had a replacement daughter. Then Maria would dress Alicia in pretty dresses, just like the ones Tiffany used to wear.

Staring at the two elegant dresses in the wardrobe beside her own sparse belongings, Alicia laughed bitterly. 'What kind of wealthy young lady am I? Who has ever seen a daughter of a rich family live like this?'

She stuffed her own clothes into a backpack, wrapped the finished painting in some old packing paper and tucked it inside too. After one last look around the room, she knew there was no coming back. Even if she forgot anything, the Lawrences would never let her return for it.

To ensure she had taken everything she needed, Alicia checked the whole room. In the corner of one drawer, she found a brooch. It was shaped like a golden leaf, dull and lackluster, so plain that no one would bother picking it up if it fell on the ground. But Alicia's eyes widened.

She recognized that brooch. In her past life, Tiffany had proudly shown it off to her. It was this very brooch that had made Tiffany become the savior of the Yates family's heir.

The Yates family was an extremely powerful clan. Every member excelled in their field, standing at the top of their professions. George Yates had held a high-ranking official position. Though largely retired, he still carried significant influence in both military and political circles.

George cherished his grandson, Charles Yates, whom he had chosen to lead the family. It was said that Charles had been sent away for rigorous training and forged a strong but cold character. After returning, he took over the reins of the Yates family.

In her past life, this powerful man was Tiffany's strongest backer. Alicia had tried repeatedly to escape the Lawrence family, but was always caught. She even called the police once, only to have Tiffany mock her. ""Even Charles is on my side. Do you really think the police can help you?""

Alicia didn't believe it and managed to call the police. But when they arrived, the Lawrences told the police she was just throwing a fit. The Yates family's steward also pressured the police to stay out of it.

After that, no one listened to Alicia's cries for help. She finally gave up trying to escape. With the Yates family backing Tiffany, she knew there was no way out.

'But why is this brooch with me now? Does that mean it was always mine? I don't remember saving Charles. But it doesn't matter. As long as Tiffany never gets this brooch, Charles will never support her. And without him, I still have a chance to get my revenge.' Alicia thought.

She picked up the brooch, wiped it clean. Now its surface seemed to brighten slightly, revealing a subtle beauty. She pinned it inside her shirt, then put on her coat to hide it completely.

She didn't know whether Tiffany already knew it could connect her to Charles. But to stay safe, she still had to keep it hidden. She couldn't risk Tiffany's bootlickers spotting it and taking it from her.

But she had to wear the brooch today. From what she remembered, Charles was returning home and would pass by this very area.

She remembered it clearly. In her past life, while resting her eyes from painting by the window, she saw Charles's car. It even paused for a moment right outside the Lawrence house.

She needed to go out before Charles's car arrived and let him catch a glimpse of the brooch by chance. She had to make sure he knew it belonged to her. Even if he wouldn't become her ally, she would never let him become Tiffany's supporter.

With everything ready, Alicia checked the time. It was almost the hour when Charles's car would pass by the Lawrence house. She slung her backpack over her shoulder and headed downstairs.

The entire Lawrence family was gathered in the living room for afternoon tea. Archie Lawrence, the youngest son, held up a photo. ""It's not often we're all together like this. Someone's always missing. Look at this family photo. Everyone must get a copy, and I want each of you to keep it in your wallet.""

Just then, Alicia came down the stairs. Everyone turned to look at her, as if suddenly remembering the adopted daughter who lived upstairs.

Adam Lawrence, the third-eldest son, looked awkward. ""Alicia, you're home? We thought you were still at school, so we didn't call you. Well, since you're here, we can take another family photo later.""

Alicia lowered her eyes with a faint smile. ""That won't be necessary. I was never really part of this family to begin with. I won't be in the photo.""

3.Chapter 3 I Owe Her Nothing
Aaron Lawrence, the family's eldest son, frowned. ""What's with the attitude? You hide in your room all day. We're all busy working and hardly at home. Did you expect us to come upstairs and beg you to join us? Why can't you be more like Tiffany? She's thoughtful and sweet. She always comes to talk with us when we get back.""

Alicia sneered. ""Do you think I want to be locked in my room? I have to paint everything Tiffany posts online, even the piece she needs to become Mr. West's student. I'd love to come down for tea and empty small talk, but when do I have the time?""

""Besides, everything I said is true. I was never really part of this family, and none of you ever treated me like one. There's no reason for me to be in your photo,"" Alicia added.

Maria had never expected the always-obedient Alicia to talk back. When Andrew came down earlier saying Alicia was throwing a tantrum, she hadn't believed him. But now it appeared to be true.

'How dare she? She's just a homeless orphan we took in out of kindness. We give her food and a roof over her head. What's so wrong with asking her to do a few things for Tiffany?' Maria thought with rising anger.

Frowning, she snapped, ""We're only asking you to paint a few pictures. Why are you making such a big deal out of it? For years, you've lived as the Lawrence daughter in Tiffany's place, well-fed, well-dressed, wanting for nothing. Do you have any idea how much she suffered out there? That should have been you. You owe her. Is it really too much to paint for her? How can you be so selfish?""

Archie chimed in, ""Exactly. You owe Tiffany this. What's the big deal with painting a few pieces for her? Why are you making such a fuss about it?""

Andrew scoffed, ""She has worn someone else's identity for so long, and starts to believe she's the real young lady. But she's nothing but a cuckoo in the nest.""

Their words struck Alicia as almost ridiculous. She let out a scornful laugh. ""Did I beg to be here? You were the ones who forced me to come here. You lost Tiffany. That is why she suffered. Stop blaming me. I will not take responsibility for your mistakes. I have nothing to do with Tiffany, and I owe her nothing.""

Maria was furious. She pointed at Alicia, her hand trembling, too angry to speak. Aaron put on his elder brother act. ""Alicia, look what you've done to Mom. Apologize now, finish that painting for Tiffany, and hand it over. Do that, and we'll let this go.""

Alicia curled her lips into a faint smile. ""In that case, don't bother letting it go. I won't apologize, and I will never paint for Tiffany again.""

Aaron could hardly believe what he was hearing. As the eldest brother, he had always received Alicia's respect and obedience. She used to do almost anything he asked. But today, she dared to talk back, which made him feel deeply humiliated.

His hands unconsciously tightened into fists. He was about to speak when Alicia continued, ""Since you all see me as a cuckoo in Tiffany's nest, I'll leave. I'm giving her place back to her.""

""You're leaving?"" Andrew laughed. ""Stop playing games, Alicia. If you really meant it, you would've left when Tiffany returned. You waited until we were all here, just to throw a fit and make us beg you to stay, so you could steal even more of Tiffany's moment. But it won't work. We see right through you.""

Archie nodded in agreement. ""Exactly. We're not playing along. If you want to leave, then go. We'd be happy to see you out. Did you really think we'd beg you to stay? Don't be ridiculous.""

Aaron sighed and shook his head dismissively, a look of faint contempt in his eyes. ""Don't make a fool of yourself. No one here is going to stop you.""

Only Adam stepped forward and took hold of Alicia's arm. ""Alicia, that's enough. Apologize to Mom, and we can put this behind us. Look how hard it's raining outside. Where could you possibly go all alone?""

Alicia stepped back, pulling her arm away. ""You don't have to worry about me."" She turned to leave without looking back.

Adam glanced at the heavy rain, which was now streaked with lightning and rumbling with thunder. He reached out to grab Alicia's backpack, his face full of concern.

Alicia was caught off guard, so Adam managed to pull the backpack off her shoulder. He froze for a moment, 'Is this all she's taking?' He stared at Alicia. ""This is all you have? You don't even have an umbrella.""

Archie snorted, a mocking smirk playing on his lips. ""She barely brought anything. She's not really planning to leave. She just wants us to beg her to stay.""

Andrew added with a scornful laugh, his eyes cold and dismissive as he glanced toward Alicia's backpack. ""Even her act is so fake. Disgusting.""

Alicia snatched her backpack back from Adam. ""Everything in here is what I bought with my own money. I won't take a single thing your family bought."" With that, she walked toward the door.

""Where do you think you're going?"" A cold, authoritative voice rang out from upstairs. Alicia turned and saw her adoptive father, Hugh Lawrence, standing on the staircase, holding a coffee cup and watching her with icy eyes.

""To where I belong,"" Alicia replied, her voice calm and her gaze steady, showing no trace of hesitation. Then, without another word or a backward glance, she turned and walked away.

""Stop."" Hugh's cold voice halted Alicia. He descended the stairs, handed his coffee cup to a maid, and settled onto the sofa, his icy gaze never leaving Alicia. ""Don't push this too far. You can't ruin something this important. Is the painting for Tiffany done?""

Hearing his father's question, Andrew grinned triumphantly. 'Let's see if this stubborn girl still dares to act tough now. I can't wait to watch her beg.'

He cut in before Alicia could speak, ""Dad, Alicia said Tiffany's business doesn't matter. Only her own does. She says she owes Tiffany nothing and won't lift a finger for Tiffany anymore. She even wants to leave our family."" He drew out the last few words, emphasizing each word.

Hugh's eyes grew even colder, edged with disdain. 'A stray we took in years ago actually thinks she's above Tiffany? How delusional. Tiffany is my real daughter, the true Lawrence heiress.'

'Let her go. When she can't make it on her own and comes crawling back, we'll have her exactly where we want her. She'll become Tiffany's shadow for the rest of her life.' With that thought, Hugh said coldly, ""If you want to leave, then go.""

4.Chapter 4 Win Over His Sympathy
Alicia said nothing more. She slung her backpack over her shoulder and pulled open the door. A cold, damp wind blew in, chilling her to the bone.

It was early autumn, and Riverdale was in the middle of its rainy season. No one could say how long the downpour would last, but Alicia knew she had to leave now, no matter what.

From behind, Maria called out, ""Alicia, if you walk out that door today, don't you dare come back! Without the Lawrence name, no one out there will even look your way.""

Alicia acted as though she hadn't heard a thing and walked on without looking back. She had no intention of ever returning.

Adam watched the wind and rain raging outside, his anxiety growing. He hurried over to stop Alicia. ""Alicia, it's pouring out there. Where will you go? Just listen to me. Apologize to Mom and Dad. It's better than being out in this storm.""

Alicia, however, reached out and pried Adam's hand away, finger by finger. ""Your real sister is back now. You should focus your attention on her. Just leave me alone.""

Adam stared at his empty hand, momentarily stunned. ""But you're my sister too,"" he blurted out, the words coming out louder and more bluntly than he intended.

Tiffany saw Adam caring for Alicia and even calling her his sister. She felt a sudden surge of anger. 'That Alicia is just a nobody who doesn't even know her own parents. How can she become my elder sister? My brother should only care about me and only love me.'

Jealousy burned in Tiffany's chest. When she saw Alicia walk toward the outdoor pool, a sly glint flashed in her eyes.

She rushed out, grabbed Alicia's arm, and pleaded, ""Alicia, please don't go. I know you're upset that I'm back. You're afraid I'll take your place. But I have nowhere else to go. Can't I stay? I promise I won't compete with you. Please don't leave.""

Alicia took one look at Tiffany's act and let out a cold laugh. ""Save your performance for someone who'll believe it. It doesn't work on me. Once I'm gone, you can put on a show for your precious family. They'll fall for every bit of it.""

After speaking, Alicia tried to pull her hand free. But Tiffany flashed a provocative smile, tightened her grip, and whispered for only Alicia to hear.

""Today I'll show you who the real Lawrence daughter is and exactly who the family truly care about."" With that, she yanked Alicia hard toward her.

Alicia raised an eyebrow. Quick and agile, she was ready to throw Tiffany into the pool. Suddenly, she heard a car pull up outside. She glanced over and instantly recognized the license plate number. With a full set of eights, it was Charles's car.

Alicia changed her mind. 'If Tiffany drags me into the pool and the whole family gangs up on me right in front of Charles, would he feel even a tiny bit of sympathy for me? I still have that brooch, which means I'm his savior. If his savior is in trouble, shouldn't he help?'

'This time, I won't let him support Tiffany. If I can win him over, that's even better. If not, I'll at least show him Tiffany's true colors.'

So she shifted her position, making sure anyone outside could see Tiffany pulling her. Then she let herself fall into the water with Tiffany.

The moment she hit the water, Alicia swallowed a mouthful. She choked so hard that it felt like half her life had drained away.

Alicia had forgotten she couldn't swim. Even though it was only a pool, she felt utterly alone and helpless, as if she had fallen into the open sea.

She complained silently to herself. 'I've lived through nine lives. How come I've never learned how to swim?' Now all she could do was thrashing helplessly in the water.

At that moment, Alicia heard the noise around her, her mother shouting, her father calling out, her brothers yelling, all of them frantic as they cried out for Tiffany. And through the family's panic, she made out a voice she knew all too well. It was her boyfriend, Henry Yates.

Alicia suddenly realized she had almost forgotten she even had a boyfriend. So much time had passed that he had nearly faded from her memory. 'Why is he here? I didn't see him when I came downstairs.'

She struggled in the water, forced her eyes open, and looked toward Henry, only to see him swimming directly toward Tiffany.

By then, Tiffany's brothers were also rushing through the water to reach Tiffany. And if she remembered correctly, Tiffany knew how to swim.

'Typical. My boyfriend would rather save Tiffany than me, and I'm the one who can't even swim. What a joke. But why am I surprised? I've known all along he's trash. I need to see how the man outside in the car reacts.' Alicia thought.

She tried to turn toward the door, but in the water she had no control. Before she could even see it, she started to sink. 'Did I go too far? I never should have jumped in with Tiffany,' Alicia already regretted it.

'Now that no one's coming to save me. I have to save myself.' Just as she was working out how to get out, a large hand grabbed her wrist and pulled her from the water.

The understated modified car was parked outside as usual. Every time it returned this way, it would stop for a while in front of the Lawrence house.

Kevin Quinn pulled over and stole a glance toward the back seat through the rearview mirror. He had been driving for Charles for over three years. Every time Charles came home and passed the Lawrence house, he would stop here for more than ten minutes.

During those ten minutes, Charles never left the car. He just sat quietly, watching the Lawrence house. Sometimes Kevin wondered if Charles had taken a liking to this house.

Every time Charles gazed at the house from the back seat, Kevin would also glance at it from the front. But after looking so many times, he still couldn't figure out what was special about the house. It was nothing compared to Yates Manor.

But today, as soon as he glanced back, he saw a flash of panic in Charles's eyes. Charles's hand went to the door handle, looking ready to step out. Kevin reached quickly for an umbrella, but before he could take it, Charles let go of the handle. He stayed in the car.

'The wind is howling and the rain is pouring. I'm not even sure this umbrella would help. I was worried Mr. Yates would get soaked, so it's a good thing he stayed in the car,' Kevin thought, feeling a sense of relief.

Both Alicia and Tiffany were brought under the poolside sunshade. Maria wrapped her own shawl around Tiffany, her eyes red with worry. ""My precious Tiffany, are you all right?""

Hugh rushed inside and called out to the kitchen staff, ""Prepare some ginger tea, now. Make sure it's hot and strong. We need it right away.""

Andrew gently patted Tiffany's back. ""Tiffany, sweetheart, did you swallow water? Try to cough and get it all out. Just take your time and breathe.""

Archie watched anxiously, rubbing Tiffany's hands to warm them. Even Henry looked on with concern, gently brushing the wet hair away from Tiffany's forehead and tucking it behind her ear.

As for Alicia, only Adam remained by her side. ""Are you okay?"" he asked with concern. ""My clothes are soaked too. Can you walk? If not, wait here. I'll get you a blanket to keep warm."" With that, he hurried toward the house.

5.Chapter 5 Your Stupid Brain
Alicia instinctively glanced toward the door. The car was still there, but she couldn't see inside the car or tell if Charles had seen what happened. 'Why hasn't he gotten out? How else can I show him the brooch? Should I go over there myself?'

Thinking this, she struggled to her feet. She also saw Adam had thoughtfully brought her backpack and placed it beside her. So she picked it up and turned to leave.

Noticing Alicia was about to leave, Henry frowned, stepped forward, and blocked her way. ""Where do you think you're going?""

""Leaving,"" Alicia replied, her voice cold and distant, her gaze fixed somewhere beyond Henry. She showed no intention to explain or stay.

""Leaving? You pushed Tiffany into the water. She's freezing, and you won't even stay to take care of her? Is that how a sister should act?"" Henry's voice was sharp with anger.

Hearing his accusation, Archie, Andrew, and Aaron all turned to glare at Alicia, their faces full of agreement.

Alicia was stunned. 'Did I hear that right? Has Henry lost his mind? Tiffany pushed me in, but no one cares about me. And now I'm supposed to stay and take care of her?'

Then she realized she should not be surprised at all. In her past life, her so-called boyfriend had always taken Tiffany's side without question. She had argued with him about it, but he said Tiffany once saved his life. He even asked Alicia to help Tiffany more, so she could repay that debt for him.

Every time she and Tiffany had a conflict, all Tiffany had to do was cry and act like the victim in front of Henry. Then he would immediately blame Alicia for being ungrateful.

He even used to say, ""If Tiffany hadn't saved me back then, you wouldn't have such a good boyfriend like me now."" So Alicia ended up having to repay the debt he owed Tiffany.

Alicia could never forget the most painful memory. In her past life, after the Lawrence family had locked her up, she managed to escape once. With nowhere else to turn, she ran to Henry, sure that he would help her. Instead, he called her vicious and handed her straight back to them.

To this day, Alicia still remembered his words clearly. ""Alicia, how can I have such a cruel girlfriend? Are you trying to ruin Tiffany? She's an internet famous artist now. If you stop painting for her, what is she supposed to do? She'll be torn apart online and face terrible cyberbullying. She's your sister. How could you do that to her?""

Hearing those words at the time, her heart felt as if it had been torn apart. She broke up with him and tried to leave, but he had his people stop her. In the end, he dragged her back to the Lawrence family himself.

As the memories rushed back, Alicia lost all patience for being polite to Henry. She said coldly, ""Tiffany and I both fell in the water, but all that water must have flooded your stupid brain, Henry.""

It was the first time anyone had ever called Henry stupid. His face darkened. ""You were jealous of Tiffany, so pushed her into the water. And now she might catch a cold. Don't you think you should stay and look after her?""

""Did you actually see me push her? And what is there to be jealous of? Her ugly face? Her lack of talent?"" Alicia shot back mockingly.

Tiffany's face twisted in anger at Alicia's words. 'Fine. The more angrily Alicia acts, the more Mom, Dad, my brothers, and even Henry will take my side. People always pity the weak one. And Alicia is too stupid to play the victim.'

She gently wiped the water from her face with a pitiful expression, her voice soft. ""Alicia, I know you're upset with me, but please don't take it out on Henry. He just feels sorry for me."" Wrapped in Maria's shawl and leaning into Aaron, she looked fragile and heartbreakingly vulnerable.

Hearing Tiffany defend him even now, Henry looked at her with tenderness, and then turned sharply to Alicia. ""You could learn a thing or two from Tiffany.""

Alicia had had enough. She raised her hand and slapped Henry across the face. ""Learn from her? You want me to learn how to be a two-faced hypocrite? Get out of my way. Go be with your little faker. We're done."" Henry never saw it coming. The slap left him stunned.

Tiffany was startled by Alicia's outburst, but secretly pleased. 'This will only make Henry hate her even more. She probably doesn't even realize who he is. Henry is from the Yates family, and he is Charles's nephew.'

A sly gleam flickered in Tiffany's eyes as she rushed to defend Henry. ""Alicia, how could you hit him? If you're mad at me, hit me instead. Don't take it out on Henry."" Alicia ignored Tiffany and walked straight toward the door.

Henry finally snapped out of it. He touched his stinging cheek, his jaw tight with anger. ""Alicia, have you lost your mind? How dare you hit me? Listen. If you don't stay and take care of Tiffany today, I will never forgive you.""

Alicia sneered inwardly. 'What a self-centered jerk.' Without looking back, she reached the main gate and pushed open the wrought iron door.

Adam came out with a blanket just in time to see Alicia leaving. He grabbed an umbrella, rushed after her, and wrapped the blanket around her shoulders.

""What are you doing out here? You're still soaked. Come back inside with me. You need to change and have some ginger tea, or you'll catch a cold,"" Adam said.

Alicia looked quietly at Adam, digging through her memories of him from her past life. Back then, he rarely came home, but whenever he did, he always brought her a gift. Later, after Tiffany started pretending to be bullied every time he visited, the gifts slowly stopped.

Alicia thought to herself, 'Today is Adam's first time back since Tiffany returned. She probably didn't have time to put on her act before I left. That's why he doesn't hate me like the rest. We did grow up together. But so what? In the end, he still hurt me in my past life.'

""Go take care of your real sister,"" Alicia said coldly. ""I don't need your concern. Keep your blanket and your umbrella. I don't want anything from the Lawrence family.""

When Adam saw her push the umbrella and blanket away, he said, ""Alicia, I know you're upset that Mom and Dad made you paint for Tiffany. They were wrong to do that. I'll talk to them.""

""There's no need,"" Alicia said, looking at him. ""And you won't change their minds anyway."" If it were that easy to persuade them, she wouldn't have suffered so much in her past life. Besides, she was sure Adam would soon be swayed by his parents, his brothers, and Tiffany.

At her words, Adam glanced back. He saw his parents and brothers all crowded around Tiffany, fussing over her with worry.

Then he looked at Alicia, who was also soaking wet but alone. A pang of guilt hit him. He knew convincing his parents to stop making Alicia paint for Tiffany would not be easy.

""If you're set on leaving, I won't stop you. But take these and this card."" He pressed the umbrella and blanket into Alicia's arms, then took a bank card from his pocket and held it out to her.

""There's some money on it. Use this for now. I'll send more each month. Don't worry. I won't let you suffer."" As he spoke, he reached up to brush the wet hair from Alicia's face.

6.Chapter 6 A Terrible Sin?
But Alicia stepped back, avoiding Adam's hand. Her voice stayed cold. ""Thank you, but I don't need it. Keep your money and your concern for someone who does.""

Just as she was about to push everything back to Adam, Archie's angry voice carried over. ""Adam, what are you doing? Tiffany fell in the water. Why aren't you over here looking after her? What's so important out there?""

Adam glanced back inside and met Tiffany's tearful, pleading eyes. She looked truly hurt. After all, she was his real sister. He couldn't help but feel sorry for her.

He turned quickly to Alicia. ""Just take these, Alicia. Rent yourself a decent place, and let me know where you end up. I have to go.""

With that, Adam turned and hurried back inside. Following Hugh's order, a servant soon came and closed the gate.

Adam walked over to Tiffany and asked with concern, ""Tiffany, are you all right?"" She clutched her chest, coughing violently without a word.

Andrew grew angry and raised his voice. ""Adam, Tiffany fell into the water and you know she has a weak constitution. You are a doctor, but you wasted time chasing after that ungrateful girl instead of checking on your real sister. Do you even care about Tiffany?""

Adam frowned. ""Why haven't you taken Tiffany inside yet? You know she fell into the water. Why keep her out here in the cold wind? She could catch a chill.""

Andrew grew even angrier. ""We tried to carry her inside, but every time we touched her, she gasped for air like she couldn't breathe. We didn't dare move her again.""

Adam turned to look at Tiffany. As a doctor, her condition did not seem serious to him. ""Tiffany,"" he asked, ""are you really unable to move?""

Hearing Adam's skeptical tone, Tiffany burned with anger. 'What's wrong with Adam? When I fell in, he didn't come to save me. Instead, he went to help Alicia. And now he's questioning me? Is this really my brother? I'll make sure he learns the lesson.'

She looked up weakly, her eyes shining with tears. ""Adam, do you not like me? Do you think I've been stealing from Alicia since I came back?""

Tears started to fall as she spoke. ""I never wanted to take anything from her, or make her leave. I'm sorry. I never should have come back. I should have just died out there long ago. It's all my fault. I made Alicia unhappy, and now I've upset you too.""

She spoke between sobs, looking fragile enough to collapse at any moment. Seeing Tiffany so upset, Hugh, Maria, and the other Lawrence brothers all turned their angry stares toward Adam.

Aaron snapped, ""Adam, what is wrong with you? Have you forgotten Tiffany is our real sister? Why are you taking that Alicia's side instead of caring for your own family?""

Andrew added, ""Adam, you've been away too long. You have no idea how kind and timid Tiffany really is. All she has ever done is try to fit in, while Alicia has done nothing but bully her since day one.""

Archie chimed in, ""Exactly. Adam, you don't even know what really happened, and yet you're making Tiffany feel guilty? That's not right. She deserves better from her own brother.""

Adam was dumbfounded. ""What? I didn't even do anything."" He stood there completely bewildered. 'I haven't done anything wrong. I just asked her, as a doctor, if she really couldn't move. Since when is that such a terrible sin?'

Maria couldn't stand to see Tiffany so upset any longer. She raised her hand and slapped Adam across the face. ""You ungrateful child! The first thing you do when you come home is make your sister cry? Get out of my sight, and don't you dare come back.""

Adam opened his mouth to explain, but Hugh cut him off impatiently. ""What else is there to say? Hurry up and find a way to carry your sister inside. It's windy and raining out here. She'll only get worse if we delay."" Adam felt completely wronged, but he could not say another word.

Seeing Adam's frustration, Tiffany smirked inwardly. 'Serves you right for helping Alicia.' Still not satisfied, she held out her hand to him.

1nu15vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maharashtra/comments/1nu15vb/today_i_learned_how_maharashtrians_are_being/,Today I learned how Maharashtrians are being pushed out of their own state by outsiders,"Few days back, there were too many posts - I mean just too many posts on Ganpati Celebrations being an inconvenience and havoc on many subs where outsiders are in overwhelming numbers.

Right from how it causes noise pollution to how they were stuck in traffic due to the Aagaman Miravnuk describing it as the ""worst day of their life""

Or posts about how idols being immersed in water bodies pose a threat to marine biology. Showing quite a concern to the ecology.

They even posted photos of littered streets pointing out the civic sense during the celebration.

All in all, I thought they were being good citizens pointing out the flaws in our celebrations that can cause potential disturbance and harm.

But little did I know it was rooted in insecurity and hatred towards the natives. Insecurity because how dare they take up the streets meant for us?  How dare they get to blast music and have fun at the cost of my peace ? 

Funnily enough, posts like above soon dropped once ""Navratri festivals"" came in. No complaints on blasting Garba music, no complaints about littering or how the immersion of idols are gonna cause a disturbance to marine biology which few days back was ""quite a concern""

The hypocrisy is mind numbing - Do you think the societies hosting Ganpati Celebrations won't have a Navaratri celebration? Yet those voices that were ""quite opinionated"" on the Ganpati Celebrations stay mute on later. 

Our language is already under an attack, our culture is too. We are the last people they want here. The sooner you understand this and vote their masters out - the better.

BJP is their golden ticket to the Power seat in MH and I have noticed them get quite restless when BJP is criticized anywhere. They come in great numbers to defend BJP and convince ""Marathi manus"" BJP is its only option. Ask yourself didn't Uddhav handle Covid quite well? Better than Fadnavis would have?
But they have convinced you Uddhav is an idiot. And BJP our sole savior.

I'm in no way endorsing Uddhav but I do know why they want BJP in power. 

One of them openly told me their agenda - Wait till BJP gets into BMC and see how we rule over you. There will no Marathi or Marathi manus left. 

Wake up and smell the coffee - you have been reduced from majority to minority in Mumbai.
And they're ready to completely push you out, all the while playing the Hindutva card while hating you more than any of the Muslims.
