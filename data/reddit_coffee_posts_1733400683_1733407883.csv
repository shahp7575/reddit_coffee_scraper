She’s Meeting an ‘Old Friend’ at a Local Expresso Shop, But Something Feels Off","Am I Overreacting? She’s Meeting an ‘Old Friend’ at a Local Expresso Shop, But Something Feels Off

I(28M) don't know what to think of my Gf(25F) . We started dating at the beginning of last year and were together for most of it. The second half of our relationship was exclusive, but there were issues and she often seemed distant and not very affectionate.
There were a few times when she admitted to flirting and talking to other people. Whenever I brought it up, she’d either change the subject or brush it off, saying it was just harmless fun. She also had hangouts with male friends alone, had at odd hours of the night and would delete the chats from her“friends.” She even admitted to emotionally cheating, both in person and through messages, saying she liked the attention and validation from other men and stringing them along 
We had many conversations about it, and she promised it would stop, but eventually, she pulled away and broke up with me. She gave a different reason for the breakup, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the other issues played a role.

Within the year she reached out, apologized for everything, and admitted that the “friends” weren’t as innocent as she made them out to be. We talked about getting back together and agreed on a committed, communicative relationship with just the two of us. Things seemed great, almost perfect and really grew as people together , and we discussed how we’d handle things better this time.
She had to leave town for a few months for working and the commute was too hard to keep up with so we continued while she was gone via text and call, and when she came back , things were good for a few weeks. she received a message from an old male friend out of nowhere from a person she claimed she didn't have any real communicating with and he randomly messaged her and asked her, and she planned to go with him for some tea and coffee . When I asked about who he was, she shut it down immediately and defensively told me she won't be argueing and said this is what is happening and refused to let me speak my feels because she didn't care about my feelings and it's a me problem,  She said she wasn’t asking for permission, got frustrated, and told me I was overreacting and controlling. She also made comments about how I should just trust her and shouldn’t question her actions. Mentioned she doesn't care what I do, It felt like things flipped back to the way they were before, where I didn’t matter and not actually loved
I really don’t want to be controlling, but after everything we’ve been through, I can’t help but feel uneasy. She insists it’s just a harmless meetup, but I’m worried that history is repeating itself. I don’t want to overthink or ruin what we’ve rebuilt, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off.

Am I being unreasonable?

TL;DR:
Girlfriend is meeting an ""old friend"" at a local espresso shop, but something feels off. I can't shake the feeling something more might be going on. Am I overreacting, or should I trust my gut?

time and time again someone will say they need friends, we’ll make a connection, there will be good energy, we express mutual interest of becoming friends, i continue to msg them, invite them to things, only for them to never come or message me until months later when they send me a paragraph or comment about how amazing they think i am and how they want to hangout with me. anytime i talk to them it’s nothing but sweet things and enthusiasm. when i say enthusiasm i mean enthusiasm, sending large paragraph or using caps if over text, talking continuously, talking about specific plans they want to do. this isn’t just a “oh we should grab a coffee sometime” situation either. they’ll say they want to do xyz with me. again and again. but they simply never hangout with me or invite me anywhere. 

i don’t expect anyone to do anything they don’t want to do. i don’t chase people. i don’t expect any of my friends to come out often. i know a lot of people struggle with anxiety or depression or illness or they have children or demanding jobs. but it just feels deceiving. i’ve talked to some of the same people for 2+ years. and it’s always the same story. why can’t people just be honest 

i am neurodivergent. i can have a hard time understanding others especially those who are shy or reserved. i’ve made so many amazing friends. socializing isn’t necessarily difficult for me but it’s different. any perspectives will be appreciated ",1,1733407630.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1h79xdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h79xdi/which_vitamix_blender_is_the_best/,Which Vitamix blender is the best?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with Vitamix blenders since I've been using them for over 5 years now. I know choosing the right blender can be overwhelming, especially with all the different models out there.

After trying several models and reading countless reviews, I can confidently say that the Vitamix Professional Series 750 is the absolute best for most people. I initially bought mine through this link: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender and it's been a game-changer in my kitchen.

What makes it stand out? First, the 2.2 HP motor is incredibly powerful. I've thrown everything at it - frozen fruits, ice, nuts, you name it. It pulverizes them into perfectly smooth smoothies every single time. No chunks, no hassle.

The pre-programmed settings are super convenient. I just hit the smoothie button and walk away - it automatically stops when done. Same goes for hot soups (yes, it actually heats them up through friction!), frozen desserts, and purees.

But here's the thing - if you're on a tighter budget, the Vitamix E310 Explorian is also fantastic. It's more basic but has the same motor power and blade design as the pricier models. The main differences are a smaller container (48 oz vs 64 oz) and no preset programs.

What I love about all Vitamix blenders:
- They're built like tanks (my parents have had theirs for 15 years!)
- The blades stay sharp forever
- 5-7 year warranties
- Super easy to clean (just blend warm water and soap)
- Can handle hot ingredients (unlike cheaper blenders)

One thing to note - they're loud. But honestly, all powerful blenders are. It's a fair trade-off for the performance you get.

If you're serious about making smoothies, soups, or any blended foods, check out the current prices here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender . They're not cheap, but they're worth every penny. I use mine daily and it's probably the most-used appliance in my kitchen after my coffee maker.

Let me know if you have any questions! I'm happy to help you choose the right model for your needs.",1,1733407564.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

These are not new employees, they have been working at this store for years. After being accused of trying to scam the system, I had to show the ASM the price stickers on the brew stations and show her that there is actually an iced coffee button. Snap allows cold coffee to be purchased, just not any hot food or drinks. Is there not a training manual for the products that Casey's sells?

1h79vaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1h79vaa/i_am_having_doubts_in_my_relationship_due_to_how/,I am having doubts in my relationship due to how it started,"Hi guys, I'm in a very complicated situation so I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Basically I (22M) have been seeing a girl (22F) for 5 months now. It had a very messy start because I knew her for a few months before we started dating and we would always go for coffees and meet each other when going out since we had overlapping friend groups, all whilst she was in another relationship.

Although I initally had pure intentions, I started developing feelings for her and thought that she maybe felt something back despite being in another relationship. 

Although I felt bad about it I had to express how I felt. In one evening I ended up telling her how I felt, we were both tipsy and we talked for a long time, she told me she was in a relationship where she loved her bf and would never overstep that boundary, nevertheless we still stayed up until 5am talking, she also sent me messages the next day saying she was feeling a bit confused now.

Then, 2 days later, her boyfriend broke up with her for unrelated reasons. She seemed extremely broken over it so I thought it would be best not to get involved for a month, but 1 month after the breakup I asked her out on a date and since then things have been going well. Now after 5 months we're in a relationship and we love each other. 

However, I can't help feeling like I was just the second choice, and I talked to her about it a month ago and inquired on how the breakup happened. During the breakup he said some bad things and acted like a POS. Turns out he broke up because he started resenting her for the way he felt she treated him, which apparently he never communicated before, after which she tried everything to salvage the relationship. 2 weeks after he broke up with her he felt better again and asked her on out on a date to be on good terms again after which they hooked up, then the next day he said he changed up and broke things off again.

After hearing this, I started feeling bad. I was there as an option and she chose a guy that broke up with her and was an asshole 2 weeks ago over me. I can't help think if he wouldn't have been an asshole the second time around they would have just gotten back together. I understand that it's my fault in the first place for getting involved but I'm now in a relationship with her and don't know what to do. She barely mentions him and also constantly shows how much she loves me. I communicated to her how I felt and she's very understanding and trying to help.

Thoughts of potentially being a second choice or her having spent 1 year of her life with this guy have been eating me alive. It's affecting my ability to sleep, concetrate and even my appetite. Due to this I haven't been able to enjoy our relationship the last 3 weeks which my girlfriend is aware of and it's also affecting her very negatively. 

She has been handling this situation very well and has tried everything to help me. I find her amazing and still love her, she doesn't care abt him anymore, but can't help thinking about the past. I have tried to fight through and even started therapy but I'm currently just considering breaking up to relieve the pain for me. I don't know if this is reasonable but I'm not sure if I could stay with someone longterm if this is how it started. Rn I'm looking for second opinions on what I should do.

To kinda dive into that last part, all those “typical” things you see women getting that they love, my wife’s not into most of it. Like I just bought her flowers randomly a week or so ago, she doesn’t like sweets or snacking, she doesn’t drink, she isn’t a huge reader or super into TV, movies, or music… she doesn’t do any particular hobbies that I can surprise her with something connected to it. She enjoys coffee, but we go out for a cup of coffee together everyday. She’s not into makeup or beauty products… she doesn’t like certain clothing brands but bc we moved to a new city her favorite stores are nowhere near by and everything would have to be ordered online and with the holidays would take awhile to get here. We go out on dates frequently too, so a date night doesn’t seem “extra” enough for her. As for like acts of service, there’s no like chores she does consistently that I can take off her plate, we both clean and do laundry; and I generally cook more often for us. 

So overall I’m just having a hard time finding something to get for her, or do for her that will show I’m here for her and that she’s special and important to me.",2,1733407381.0,AskMenAdvice,6,1.0,False

**Summary**

Down-and-out Crowley is a mess. And that would be fine if not for his mounting pile of bills.
When he gets a call from a lawyer saying he has inherited a large sum of money and an old property in the sleepy village of Whickber, his luck seems to change.

However, there’s a catch. If the cottage is destroyed, he can’t get the inheritance.

Enter reluctant Parish Councillor Aziraphale Fell, who has been put in charge of the new Eden development set to crash through Apple Tree Cottage. 

The only way Crowley can save it: move there. 

**Excerpt from Chap 5 (I’m not going to spoil the ending here!)** 

“Have you ever performed anything?” Aziraphale asked, waving his arm around the stage. Crowley shot an eyebrow up at Aziraphale.

“No, I suppose not,” Aziraphale said. “You’d make an excellent stagehand though in those clothes.”
“Love being behind the scenes.”

“Hiding in dark corners.”

“You really are a creature of the night, aren’t you?”
“Practically vampiric.”

Aziraphale let a small grin go over his lips as Crowley’s shoulders began to loosen.

“Show us a trick then,” Crowley said.

“Oh, ah - well most of my props are of course in the bookshop. But -” he said, his eyes lighting up. “This one I could do anywhere.” He ruffled around in his coat pocket, and pulled out a ten pence and a two pence coin. He waved his hands in the air, and opened it again, to show one of the coins had gone.

Then without thinking, he pushed his hand up to Crowley’s ear, and felt his fingers ever so slightly brush past a few loose wisps of his red hair. This brief contact sent a jolt flying through Aziraphale. 
“Ah,” he yelped as the coin dropped from his hand, rolling off the stage.

“Hmm, and you performed that on here did you? To an audience?” Crowley’s face had contorted into barely hidden laughter.

“I have some bigger tricks at home,” Aziraphale muttered, still thinking about the brush of the man’s hair against his hands. What would it be like to run his hands through Crowley’s hair?

Aziraphale coughed, scanning the room for anything else to look at or think about. 

“Well, I’d better. You know,” Crowley said, finishing the last of his coffee.

“I come here every Wednesday and Friday,” Aziraphale blurted out.

“Okay,” Crowley said, nodding. 

“And I’m always in the bookshop. If you wanted to see those magic books.”

“Sure,” Crowley responded.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

# 1. Go Green or Go Home: Sustainability is King 🌍

# 4. Lights, Camera, Action: The Short-Form Video Revolution 🎥

","[Part1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1h35gw1/the_cursed_medallions_part1/)

A strong sense of déjà vu washed over me as I followed the raven’s lead. The places I drove past felt eerily familiar, as if plucked straight from my dream, though the journey in reality felt far more longer. 

I drove for nearly two days straight, taking only brief naps along the way. 

Strangely, the raven seemed to sense when my exhaustion became unbearable and it would perch quietly on a nearby tree, waiting, as I rested. Then, when it was time to resume the journey, it would swoop near my car and let out a sudden, sharp caw, jolting me awake and back into motion.

After covering thousands of miles, I finally arrived at a small town that matched the vivid image from my dream. The raven guided me all the way to the house with the purple door, circling twice above it before flying off. 

The house was almost identical to what I had seen in my dream—the purple door, the neatly decorated foyer, and the tidy garden beside it. But one key detail was different - within the same compound stood another smaller building at the far end, like a guest house or quarters, with a ""For Rent"" sign hanging from its gate.

My heart raced as I sat in the car, staring at the purple door. 

None of this made any sense, yet here I was, in a strange little town, with no clue what to expect. 

*Who would open that door if I rang the bell? I silently thought to myself.*

 My mind spiraled with possibilities—half hoping, against all reason, that Ben would be the one to greet me, or fearing something far more sinister waiting behind it.

The more I thought, the more my nerves unraveled. 

Shaking off the chaos in my head, I grabbed the bag, stepped out of the car, and walked toward the entrance. 

With a deep breath, I rang the bell.

When the door opened, an older woman, likely in her late sixties, stood at the entrance with a curious expression on her face. 

She was of medium build and wore a floral gown that gave her an air of simple elegance. Her hair was neatly pinned back into a tidy bun, and large horn-rimmed glasses framed her inquisitive eyes.

""Yes?"" she asked, her tone polite yet measured, as she peered at me through the thick lenses.

""Good evening, ma'am,"" I greeted her, with a small nod. ""I'm Emily Moore. I happened to be passing through this town and noticed the 'For Rent' sign on your property."" 

 ""I'm traveling and was hoping you might consider renting the space to me for a short stay.""

“Hello Emily, glad to meet you and please call me Martha,” she responded, breaking into a warm smile as I shook her hand. 

“ The guest house is certainly available for rent. How long are you planning to stay?” 

“I’m looking to stay for a month, maybe longer,” I replied, quickly fabricating a story about how I was conducting research on the local history and folklore of the town and its surrounding areas. 

She nodded thoughtfully, listening with genuine interest, before outlining the terms and conditions. After I paid a small advance, she disappeared inside to retrieve the keys and returned a few moments later, then led me to the guest house.

As we walked through the garden, I couldn’t help but admire the neat rows of vegetables that had been carefully planted, resembling a tiny market in its own right. 

Martha next inserted the key into the door and opened it, gesturing for me to enter.

The guest house, though small, was cozy and well maintained, offering all the essentials— a cot, kitchenette, attached bath, TV, and refrigerator. She placed the key in a bowl and wished me goodnight as she quietly closed the door behind me.

I set the Chanel bag on a nearby chair and sat down on the bed, just to momentarily rest my sore back. But the exhaustion immediately hit me like a tidal wave, and all I could think of was sleep. 

I removed the medallion from my pocket and set it on the bedside table, then lay down, drifting off into a deep, immediate slumber.

When I opened my eyes, I could sense that dawn had broken, but I remained motionless, unwilling to leave the warmth of the bed. 

Yet, something had jolted me from my sleep, and then I heard it again. 

A siren, distant at first, but growing louder and more urgent with every passing second. Panic surged through me, and I sat up, eyes darting around the room. Everything appeared normal, untouched, but the siren’s wail only intensified.

I rushed to the front door, trying to open it, but it was wedged tight, as though something was holding it shut from the outside. Desperate, I pushed through hard, managing just enough space to peek through. 

My heart stopped when I saw Martha lying on the ground, a pool of blood surrounding her.

I pushed the door with all my strength, and it finally gave way, causing Martha’s body to roll over the doorstep and into the garden. Stumbling out of the house, I watched in horror as her blood soaked into the soil. 

The sirens pierced the air as I stood motionless, waiting for fate to take its course, watching the compound fill with police cars, as officers spilled out of the vehicles, guns drawn.

My eyes snapped open again as I lay in bed, realizing I had just been jolted awake from yet another unsettling dream. 

 Before I could shake off the lingering shivers, I heard a knock on the front door.

I sat up straight, immediately pinching myself to ensure I wasn’t trapped in a dream within a dream. 

When the sting shot through me, I jumped out of bed and hurried to the door, my mind already racing with worry about what would happen next.

To my surprise and relief, I found Martha standing at the doorstep, smiling with a breakfast tray in hand.

“Good morning, Emily,” she greeted me warmly. “Sorry if I spooked you,” she added, noticing the look on my face. “I saw your car parked in the same spot since yesterday, and I wondered if you’d had anything decent to eat. So I thought I’d bring you something. Nothing fancy—just some stew made with our home grown produce and some hot coffee for you,” she said, extending the tray.

I accepted it gratefully, but my gaze drifted to a young man working in the garden—a boy about 16 or 17. The basket he held in hand was filled with tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, and  bell peppers. Martha noticed my look and immediately explained.

“This is Alex, one of my neighbors. He’s a strong young man with a good head on his shoulders. He likes to help an old lady like me out,” she said with a fond smile. The young boy raised his hat at me before getting back to work.

“Thank you so much for this, Martha. I’m famished, I won’t lie,” I said finally to Martha as I held the tray.

She gave me a knowing smile and turned to head back to her house, but paused before looking back at me. 

“Tell you what, why don’t you join me for lunch later today? I know you haven’t had time to set up yet. Please, come by my place. Anytime after 1 is fine. And I am not taking no for an answer. Great, that’s settled then” She gave me a final smile before continuing her walk, leaving me stranded at the doorway before I even had the time to respond. 

I closed the door and set the tray on the bed, my gaze immediately drawn to the medallion on the table. So much had happened in the last five minutes, and it was all making my head spin.

After what happened at the bank, I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt, especially not ending up dead—much less bringing the police into my life again. 

Just the thought of it made my stomach twist, and I considered packing up and moving immediately.  

But something inside me kept me rooted. 

Maybe I was where I was supposed to be. After all, the raven led me here, to this town, and perhaps even to this house. Maybe, just maybe, I could pick up something on Ben. 

Then the image of the abandoned lighthouse flashed in my mind, and I wondered why I hadn’t passed it during my drive. 

It was the first thing that flashed in my mind when I came to this town in my dream. So I had to check it out, see if anything stood out, and then slip away quietly before anything went wrong.

Meanwhile the first spoonful of stew was heavenly. I couldn’t tell if it was Martha’s cooking or simply the fact that I hadn’t eaten properly in days, but it was pure bliss nevertheless. It just seemed to melt in my mouth and was easily the best thing I’d tasted in ages. I devoured the rest quickly, and washed it down with the hot coffee.

Afterward, I showered and dressed, then searched online for any nearby lighthouses. I found one just a few miles away. Before leaving, I hid my bag full of money in the lowest rack of the bedroom closet. I got into my car and followed the coordinates. It didn’t take long before I found it—and it was exactly as I had seen it in my vision.

An old, derelict building in ruins stood ahead, surrounded by a dense thicket of shrubs and overgrown plants. If Ben were here, this would undoubtedly be the kind of place he’d choose to hide.

Stepping out of my vehicle, my eyes caught a tarp partially visible through the foliage. I pushed through the underbrush and uncovered a Honda Civic, its surface thick with dust and grime, clearly untouched for weeks. The location felt odd—an unusual and deliberate place to park a car.

I turned my attention to the lighthouse next, pushing open the door and climbing the rickety stairs to the top.

There was a small, rundown cabin up there, and as I entered, I immediately noticed Ben’s watch and the boots he’d worn the day we parted ways. 

Around them were also empty cans of food, milk cartons, and a bowl that still smelled faintly of sour milk.

 But what truly made my skin crawl was the pile of snake skin in the corner, dried and crumpled, possibly remnants of a shedding.

Across the room, a small wooden cupboard stood with its door slightly ajar. I opened it fully and noticed a loose floorboard underneath. 

When I pried it open, I found Ben’s cell phone beneath, its display cracked, and his Colt Python revolver resting beside it—the gun he always carried. A chill ran through me as the weight of the discovery sank in.

On one hand, I was relieved to finally be getting answers about his disappearance, which had been bothering me for weeks. On the other, a growing sense of worry began to settle in, as it only raised more questions about his safety.

*Where is he now? Why did he leave his stuff here? Why did he come to this town like me in the first place? Is he still continuing to hang around this town? Or is the medallion in its own way trying to unite the two of us back together?* 

*But is he still even alive in the first place?*

My heart ached when I considered the last possibility.

 Looking around the cabin, it was clear he hadn't returned here in a while. 

 The cellphone was dead and gone. So I picked the revolver, stuffed it into the small of my back and made my way back to the car. 

As I started my drive back to the guest house, my mind quickly flashed back to the event at the pawn shop a few months back. 

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!” Ben’s voice had echoed through the store, startling me. I turned to see him standing frozen, his face a mix of horror and subtle amusement. 

His eyes darted between my face and my hands, and when I followed his gaze, I froze.

I was holding both medallions—one ruby-encrusted, the other emerald-encrusted. 

I didn’t even remember picking them up. Mesmerized, I simply stood there, oblivious to the store assistant’s warnings, clutching the auric seals of Teotihuacan. 

The emerald medallion, in particular, burned itself into my memory. It featured a serpent coiled around an hourglass—a detail that now struck me as disturbingly significant.

Then the memory blurred again.  One moment I was inside the store, and the next, I was sprinting outside with both medallions clutched tightly in my hands. 

In no time, the cops were in hot pursuit, with Ben desperately trying to outrace them.

“I’ll draw them away,” he finally said, as he pulled over near an underground tunnel, urging me to escape on foot. 

I hesitated, but as he kissed me goodbye, I shoved the emerald medallion into his hand, silently praying he’d make it. I watched as he sped off, the sirens growing louder in the distance.

Now, back in the present, as I made my way to Martha’s home, a hundred things were going on in my head. The revolver in the small of my back, the snake skin in the lighthouse cabin, and the medallions—all of it felt like pieces of a puzzle I wasn’t sure I wanted to solve.

Upon reaching the guest house, I quickly opened the bedroom closet and placed the revolver in the bag, but kept the zip open so that I could reach for it at a moment's notice. But I kept the ruby medallion in my pocket. After freshening up, I left to meet Martha for lunch.

When I rang the doorbell, Alex greeted me at the door, dressed in an apron and ushered me inside. 

“Martha’s still in the kitchen,” he said, leading me to the living room.

From somewhere in the house, Martha’s cheerful voice called out, “I’m almost done, dear! Just a minute—make yourself at home.”

I sank into a cozy couch and glanced around the room. The house was modest yet inviting, and decorated with care.

A large TV dominated the center wall, with a single armchair angled toward it. The setup suggested quiet evenings spent alone.

 On one of the other walls were framed photographs, some featuring Martha alongside a man of similar age, their smiles frozen in happier times.

“That’s Henry, my husband,” Martha said from behind me, her voice soft but steady. I turned to see her pointing at one of the photos. “He passed away five years ago,” she added, as she served me a glass of iced tea.

Martha then took the seat across from me and we chatted about small, mundane stuff. When the moment felt right, I showed her Ben's photo and casually asked if she'd seen him, keeping my tone light to avoid suspicion.

She shook her head, frowning slightly. “No, dear. No one’s stayed at my guest house for quite some time. We don’t get many visitors around here,” she replied.

We spoke a bit more before she suggested we start lunch. 

By then, Alex had already set the table, arranging an inviting spread: roasted chicken, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, and a freshly baked apple pie. The aroma filled the room, making my stomach growl in anticipation.

“What will I do when you leave, kiddo?” Martha said, looking at Alex with a fond, wistful expression. “Our boy here will be heading off to Harvard this summer on a full scholarship to study law,” she added, turning to me, her voice filled with pride.

As we sat down, Martha served the food, moving deftly across the platters. The meal was as delicious as it looked, and the conversation flowed easily.

Then, as Martha reached across the table for more potatoes, something glinted at her neck.

I froze. The emerald medallion swung from a gold chain around her throat - its distinctive serpent coiling around an hourglass—impossible to miss.

My stomach clenched as my mind began to race.

Martha, even as she noticed the color draining from my face, calmly spooned more mashed potatoes onto her plate, her expression serene and almost nonchalant. Alex remained engrossed in his meal, while I shifted nervously in my seat. 

The food in my mouth no longer tasted as good, and was stuck at the back of my throat as I struggled to swallow, causing me to suddenly erupt into a coughing fit. As I tried to reach for my glass of water,my hand knocked it over sending it crashing to the floor. 

“Alex, why don’t you bring Emily another glass?” Martha intervened, gesturing toward the kitchen.

Before Alex could react, I stood up quickly, raising a hand to stop him. “I’ll get it,” I said, my voice abrupt.

I needed a moment away from them, away from the room.

In the kitchen, I gripped the counter, steadying myself as I reached for a glass. That’s when I heard it—clear and unmistakable.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!”

The voice sent a jolt through me. It was Ben. It was Ben’s voice. My heart raced as I turned toward the hall.

The television, which had been off moments ago, was now turned on. A grainy video played on the screen, displaying security footage from the pawn shop.

My legs moved on their own, carrying me back into the living room where I collapsed into a chair, my knees almost giving away.

On the screen, the footage played like a nightmare brought to life.

There I was, standing in the shop, holding the medallions in both hands, my eyes locked in a daze, wild with desire as Ben started to speak louder and louder trying to get my attention. 

The shop assistant, Pete, looked alarmed, gesturing for me with his hands to put the medallions down.

But I ignored them both, my grip tightening as I stared at the medallions, mesmerized.

It wasn’t until Ben placed a firm hand on my shoulder and gave me a hard shake that I finally broke free from the spell.

Reluctantly, I set the medallions back on the tray, my fingers hesitating as if they didn’t want to let go.

When I turned to look at Ben, his expression was a curious mix of amusement and quiet resolve. 

But I knew him too well—behind that facade was the man I had fallen in love with, someone would do anything to give me what I wanted.

Even before he spoke, I could see it in his eyes. I knew exactly what he was about to do as he turned to face Pete.

“Okay. I think I’d like to buy these. What’s it going to cost?” he asked, looking at Pete.

Pete, already visibly annoyed, scoffed. “Oh, come on, Ben. I’m not in the mood for this. Just last month, you came here to sell your ring because you were short on cash.”

“I mean it,” Ben pressed, his voice unwavering. “I want to buy them. I don’t care if they’re cursed. Tell me what it’s going to cost.”

Pete glared at him, exasperated, before finally spitting out, “Three hundred thousand dollars.” His tone dripped with disdain as he eyed the two of us, clearly expecting Ben to back down.

I nudged Ben urgently, whispering that it was time to leave, but the air between the two men crackled with tension. As Pete moved to return the tray to its place, Ben and I turned eventually to leave the store—then he stopped abruptly.

What happened next was something I could never fully understand or admit to myself even after all these months. 

Ben’s face went cold, his expression vacant, like he’d fallen into a trance of his own. Without a word, he drew his revolver and fired.

The deafening shot echoed through the shop as Pete crumpled to the floor, lifeless. I gasped, my hands instinctively covering my mouth in shock.

Ben had always carried a firearm, but he wasn’t the kind of man to shoot first. He was not the trigger happy sort. In fact he had never aimed that weapon at another person before until that point. But now he stood motionless, his face unreadable.

“Pick up the medallions,” he said finally, his voice sharp and commanding.

Still in shock, I did as told, and together, we fled the shop, the medallions clutched tightly in my grasp.

The video suddenly came to a stop as the TV screen went blank. 

Except for the sound of my own breathing, the room fell silent and the silence became suffocating as I felt two pairs of eyes looking straight at me,waiting patiently for me to react. 

Summoning what little courage I had left, I forced myself to meet Martha's gaze. Her eyes were unwavering, cold and accusing, while her fingers absently fidgeted with the chain around her neck.

""My son, my only child is dead because of you,"" she said, her voice steady but quivering with restrained emotion. ""My flesh and blood. He was all I had left in this world, and you took him from me.""

""And all for what? For this?""

She lifted the medallion from her neck, its emerald surface faintly gleaming in the dim light. Her face twisted with grief and contempt as I sat frozen, guilt tightening around my chest, making me unable to respond.

""You came all this way looking for your boyfriend, didn’t you? So take it. Find out for yourself.""

Her words chilled me, but I slowly extended my  hand, picking up the medallion. The moment my fingers closed around it, a sharp, searing pain shot through my head, blurring my vision. My head snapped back as a vivid, horrifying vision unfolded before me.

Ben appeared, his face breaking into a smile as he looked down where a serpent lay coiled on the floor with its hood up. He poured milk into a shallow bowl, and the snake drank from it. The scene quickly shifted—Ben was now driving his car, the serpent wrapped around his arm. Each time the snake raised its hood, pointing left or right, Ben followed its silent command, turning the steering wheel accordingly.

The vision morphed again, this time to Martha's home. She sat on her couch, tears streaming down her face as she watched the security footage of her son’s murder on an endless loop. The sound of a doorbell broke her from her misery, and she opened the door to find Ben standing there, smiling as he introduced himself.

I gasped as the vision ended, my body jerking back so suddenly that my head throbbed painfully. My temples pulsed as though they might split open.

Then, the scene shifted again—Ben was lying on the floor, clutching his throat, foaming at the mouth, while Martha stood over him, holding a half-consumed glass of iced tea.

At the same time, I felt something physically wrong with me as well. My body burned, like a violent fever was overtaking me. Blood trickled from my nostrils and mouth, and it dawned on me—I had been poisoned, too. My mind flashed to the drink Martha had given me before the meal.

Dazed, I tried to rise from my seat, but my legs gave way, sending me crashing to the floor.

Alex rushed forward, steadying me with his hands as I struggled to stay conscious.

The moment his hands touched me, another vision surged through my mind with brutal force. 

Alex stood in Martha’s living room, a cleaver glinting in his grasp. The blade arced through the air and came down with horrifying precision, striking Ben several times, who already lay lifeless on the floor. 

The scene shifted again—Alex, burying Ben’s remains in shallow graves dug in the barren patch beside the house. Days flickered by as Alex and Martha worked side by side, planting seeds in the freshly turned soil. Weeks blurred together, and the once-empty patch became a lush garden. The plants thrived, nourished by the horror buried beneath.

The realization hit me like a truck: they had used those very vegetables from that garden to feed me. My stomach churned violently as the nausea overwhelmed me. Staggering to my feet, I bolted for the door, desperate for air.

I stumbled into the garden, gulping in deep breaths, but the moment I took in my surroundings, the nausea returned with full force. 

Doubling over, I retched, vomiting up the food I had just eaten, my body rejecting the horrifying truth.

When I turned back toward the house, Martha was standing there, watching me with a cold stare. Behind her, Alex loomed, clutching a large knife in his hand.

“Finish it,” she said, her voice steady and without remorse, as though this were a task no different from any other chore.

Panic surged through me as I fought my failing body from losing consiousness. I threw both my medallions to the floor, staggered to my feet, and rushed toward the guesthouse, instinct pulling me toward the closet where I’d hidden Ben’s revolver. 

As I reached the closet , my hands trembled as I fumbled with the handle, throwing the door open. 

A wave of relief washed over me when I saw the gun still lying there.

But my relief was short-lived. 

Coiled inside the cupboard, hidden among the shadows, was the serpent. Its eyes glinted in the dim light before it lunged, sinking its fangs deep into my throat.

Pain erupted like fire, spreading rapidly through my veins. My body seized as the venom took hold, the strength draining from my limbs. The gun slipped from my grasp and clattered to the floor.

 Darkness crept in at the edges of my vision, and I collapsed, the world fading as my consciousness slipped away.

When I woke, I had no sense of how much time had passed. My body felt light, as if it had been restored to full health, as though I'd been reborn. 

Ben's revolver lay beside me, cold and waiting. I picked it up and stepped out cautiously, only to freeze at the sight before me.

Martha was lying face down in the grass, her throat slit, a crimson pool spreading beneath her. Nearby, Alex stood motionless, his expression distant, as though caught in a trance. In his hand, he gripped a bloodied knife.

As I emerged, his eyes flickered to me, and he dropped to one knee. “Your Highness,” he murmured, holding the knife aloft like an offering to royalty.

 My eyes however darted between the raven and the serpent lying still in the grass, their unblinking eyes locked on me, and the two medallions glinting on the ground between them. 

Then, piercing through the suffocating silence, came the sound of sirens in the distance.

“What is happening?” I demanded, my voice trembling.

Alex’s gaze remained fixed on the ground. “It is the police,” he replied evenly. “I called them.”

“But why?” I asked, unable to hide my exasperation. 

“You must make a choice, Your Highness,” he said, his voice calm yet unyielding. “The medallions represent the future and the past. When you touched them for the first time, you became the natural custodian of the Auric Seals of Teotihuacan.”

His words sent a chill down my spine. “What does that mean?” I slowly asked.

“The medallions cannot be apart for long. They will always find a way back to one another, no matter the cost—through whatever means necessary. ”

“ You hold the power now to decide how this story unfolds”

The sirens grew louder, closer, like a ticking clock urging me toward a decision.

“Pick up the medallions, Your Highness,” Alex said, his tone commanding yet reverent.

I hesitated before reaching down. My fingers brushed the emerald-studded medallion, and a sharp pain shot through my forehead. A vision erupted in my mind—a harrowing glimpse of what was to come. I saw myself sitting on the grass, having abandoned the medallions and waiting for the police to arrive. Alex’s face, once composed, twisted into something unrecognizable. Without warning, he lunged at me, plunging the knife into my chest. The pain was visceral, and even within the vision, it left me gasping. I shuddered as the image dissolved.

My trembling hand moved to the ruby medallion. As I grasped it, another vision surged forward. This time, I saw myself running—driving away from the chaos as Alex charged toward the police, putting himself in harm's way in a desperate bid to buy me time. The visions faded, leaving me breathless and shaking. 

“Have you made your choice, Your Highness?” Alex asked a moment later, his voice steady but his gaze firmly fixed on the ground.

I swallowed hard, nodding.

“Then give me the gun,” he said softly, extending his hand.

Reluctantly, I placed the revolver in his palm. Alex bowed once, solemn and final, before turning and sprinting toward the approaching sirens. 

Shots rang out almost immediately as he fired at the sky before aiming his gun at the vehicles arriving in front of him. 

I stumbled toward my car, the medallions clutched tightly in my hands. The serpent slithered onto the passenger seat, coiling itself with an eerie calm. 

Overhead, the raven soared, charting a path forward as if guiding my escape. 

I started the engine, the tires screeching as the car surged forward,  speeding away just as a firefight ignited in the backdrop. 

The road stretched ahead, an uncertain future waiting to unfold.

","[Part1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h31ybz/the_mystery_of_the_auric_seals_of_teotihuacan/)

A strong sense of déjà vu washed over me as I followed the raven’s lead. The places I drove past felt eerily familiar, as if plucked straight from my dream, though the journey in reality felt far more longer. 

I drove for nearly two days straight, taking only brief naps along the way. 

Strangely, the raven seemed to sense when my exhaustion became unbearable and it would perch quietly on a nearby tree, waiting, as I rested. Then, when it was time to resume the journey, it would swoop near my car and let out a sudden, sharp caw, jolting me awake and back into motion.

After covering thousands of miles, I finally arrived at a small town that matched the vivid image from my dream. The raven guided me all the way to the house with the purple door, circling twice above it before flying off. 

The house was almost identical to what I had seen in my dream—the purple door, the neatly decorated foyer, and the tidy garden beside it. But one key detail was different - within the same compound stood another smaller building at the far end, like a guest house or quarters, with a ""For Rent"" sign hanging from its gate.

My heart raced as I sat in the car, staring at the purple door. 

None of this made any sense, yet here I was, in a strange little town, with no clue what to expect. 

*Who would open that door if I rang the bell? I silently thought to myself.*

 My mind spiraled with possibilities—half hoping, against all reason, that Ben would be the one to greet me, or fearing something far more sinister waiting behind it.

The more I thought, the more my nerves unraveled. 

Shaking off the chaos in my head, I grabbed the bag, stepped out of the car, and walked toward the entrance. 

With a deep breath, I rang the bell.

When the door opened, an older woman, likely in her late sixties, stood at the entrance with a curious expression on her face. 

She was of medium build and wore a floral gown that gave her an air of simple elegance. Her hair was neatly pinned back into a tidy bun, and large horn-rimmed glasses framed her inquisitive eyes.

""Yes?"" she asked, her tone polite yet measured, as she peered at me through the thick lenses.

""Good evening, ma'am,"" I greeted her, with a small nod. ""I'm Emily Moore. I happened to be passing through this town and noticed the 'For Rent' sign on your property."" 

 ""I'm traveling and was hoping you might consider renting the space to me for a short stay.""

“Hello Emily, glad to meet you and please call me Martha,” she responded, breaking into a warm smile as I shook her hand. 

“ The guest house is certainly available for rent. How long are you planning to stay?” 

“I’m looking to stay for a month, maybe longer,” I replied, quickly fabricating a story about how I was conducting research on the local history and folklore of the town and its surrounding areas. 

She nodded thoughtfully, listening with genuine interest, before outlining the terms and conditions. After I paid a small advance, she disappeared inside to retrieve the keys and returned a few moments later, then led me to the guest house.

As we walked through the garden, I couldn’t help but admire the neat rows of vegetables that had been carefully planted, resembling a tiny market in its own right. 

Martha next inserted the key into the door and opened it, gesturing for me to enter.

The guest house, though small, was cozy and well maintained, offering all the essentials— a cot, kitchenette, attached bath, TV, and refrigerator. She placed the key in a bowl and wished me goodnight as she quietly closed the door behind me.

I set the Chanel bag on a nearby chair and sat down on the bed, just to momentarily rest my sore back. But the exhaustion immediately hit me like a tidal wave, and all I could think of was sleep. 

I removed the medallion from my pocket and set it on the bedside table, then lay down, drifting off into a deep, immediate slumber.

When I opened my eyes, I could sense that dawn had broken, but I remained motionless, unwilling to leave the warmth of the bed. 

Yet, something had jolted me from my sleep, and then I heard it again. 

A siren, distant at first, but growing louder and more urgent with every passing second. Panic surged through me, and I sat up, eyes darting around the room. Everything appeared normal, untouched, but the siren’s wail only intensified.

I rushed to the front door, trying to open it, but it was wedged tight, as though something was holding it shut from the outside. Desperate, I pushed through hard, managing just enough space to peek through. 

My heart stopped when I saw Martha lying on the ground, a pool of blood surrounding her.

I pushed the door with all my strength, and it finally gave way, causing Martha’s body to roll over the doorstep and into the garden. Stumbling out of the house, I watched in horror as her blood soaked into the soil. 

The sirens pierced the air as I stood motionless, waiting for fate to take its course, watching the compound fill with police cars, as officers spilled out of the vehicles, guns drawn.

My eyes snapped open again as I lay in bed, realizing I had just been jolted awake from yet another unsettling dream. 

 Before I could shake off the lingering shivers, I heard a knock on the front door.

I sat up straight, immediately pinching myself to ensure I wasn’t trapped in a dream within a dream. 

When the sting shot through me, I jumped out of bed and hurried to the door, my mind already racing with worry about what would happen next.

To my surprise and relief, I found Martha standing at the doorstep, smiling with a breakfast tray in hand.

“Good morning, Emily,” she greeted me warmly. “Sorry if I spooked you,” she added, noticing the look on my face. “I saw your car parked in the same spot since yesterday, and I wondered if you’d had anything decent to eat. So I thought I’d bring you something. Nothing fancy—just some stew made with our home grown produce and some hot coffee for you,” she said, extending the tray.

I accepted it gratefully, but my gaze drifted to a young man working in the garden—a boy about 16 or 17. The basket he held in hand was filled with tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, zucchini, and  bell peppers. Martha noticed my look and immediately explained.

“This is Alex, one of my neighbors. He’s a strong young man with a good head on his shoulders. He likes to help an old lady like me out,” she said with a fond smile. The young boy raised his hat at me before getting back to work.

“Thank you so much for this, Martha. I’m famished, I won’t lie,” I said finally to Martha as I held the tray.

She gave me a knowing smile and turned to head back to her house, but paused before looking back at me. 

“Tell you what, why don’t you join me for lunch later today? I know you haven’t had time to set up yet. Please, come by my place. Anytime after 1 is fine. And I am not taking no for an answer. Great, that’s settled then” She gave me a final smile before continuing her walk, leaving me stranded at the doorway before I even had the time to respond. 

I closed the door and set the tray on the bed, my gaze immediately drawn to the medallion on the table. So much had happened in the last five minutes, and it was all making my head spin.

After what happened at the bank, I didn’t want anyone else getting hurt, especially not ending up dead—much less bringing the police into my life again. 

Just the thought of it made my stomach twist, and I considered packing up and moving immediately.  

But something inside me kept me rooted. 

Maybe I was where I was supposed to be. After all, the raven led me here, to this town, and perhaps even to this house. Maybe, just maybe, I could pick up something on Ben. 

Then the image of the abandoned lighthouse flashed in my mind, and I wondered why I hadn’t passed it during my drive. 

It was the first thing that flashed in my mind when I came to this town in my dream. So I had to check it out, see if anything stood out, and then slip away quietly before anything went wrong.

Meanwhile the first spoonful of stew was heavenly. I couldn’t tell if it was Martha’s cooking or simply the fact that I hadn’t eaten properly in days, but it was pure bliss nevertheless. It just seemed to melt in my mouth and was easily the best thing I’d tasted in ages. I devoured the rest quickly, and washed it down with the hot coffee.

Afterward, I showered and dressed, then searched online for any nearby lighthouses. I found one just a few miles away. Before leaving, I hid my bag full of money in the lowest rack of the bedroom closet. I got into my car and followed the coordinates. It didn’t take long before I found it—and it was exactly as I had seen it in my vision.

An old, derelict building in ruins stood ahead, surrounded by a dense thicket of shrubs and overgrown plants. If Ben were here, this would undoubtedly be the kind of place he’d choose to hide.

Stepping out of my vehicle, my eyes caught a tarp partially visible through the foliage. I pushed through the underbrush and uncovered a Honda Civic, its surface thick with dust and grime, clearly untouched for weeks. The location felt odd—an unusual and deliberate place to park a car.

I turned my attention to the lighthouse next, pushing open the door and climbing the rickety stairs to the top.

There was a small, rundown cabin up there, and as I entered, I immediately noticed Ben’s watch and the boots he’d worn the day we parted ways. 

Around them were also empty cans of food, milk cartons, and a bowl that still smelled faintly of sour milk.

 But what truly made my skin crawl was the pile of snake skin in the corner, dried and crumpled, possibly remnants of a shedding.

Across the room, a small wooden cupboard stood with its door slightly ajar. I opened it fully and noticed a loose floorboard underneath. 

When I pried it open, I found Ben’s cell phone beneath, its display cracked, and his Colt Python revolver resting beside it—the gun he always carried. A chill ran through me as the weight of the discovery sank in.

On one hand, I was relieved to finally be getting answers about his disappearance, which had been bothering me for weeks. On the other, a growing sense of worry began to settle in, as it only raised more questions about his safety.

*Where is he now? Why did he leave his stuff here? Why did he come to this town like me in the first place? Is he still continuing to hang around this town? Or is the medallion in its own way trying to unite the two of us back together?* 

*But is he still even alive in the first place?*

My heart ached when I considered the last possibility.

 Looking around the cabin, it was clear he hadn't returned here in a while. 

 The cellphone was dead and gone. So I picked the revolver, stuffed it into the small of my back and made my way back to the car. 

As I started my drive back to the guest house, my mind quickly flashed back to the event at the pawn shop a few months back. 

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!” Ben’s voice had echoed through the store, startling me. I turned to see him standing frozen, his face a mix of horror and subtle amusement. 

His eyes darted between my face and my hands, and when I followed his gaze, I froze.

I was holding both medallions—one ruby-encrusted, the other emerald-encrusted. 

I didn’t even remember picking them up. Mesmerized, I simply stood there, oblivious to the store assistant’s warnings, clutching the auric seals of Teotihuacan. 

The emerald medallion, in particular, burned itself into my memory. It featured a serpent coiled around an hourglass—a detail that now struck me as disturbingly significant.

Then the memory blurred again.  One moment I was inside the store, and the next, I was sprinting outside with both medallions clutched tightly in my hands. 

In no time, the cops were in hot pursuit, with Ben desperately trying to outrace them.

“I’ll draw them away,” he finally said, as he pulled over near an underground tunnel, urging me to escape on foot. 

I hesitated, but as he kissed me goodbye, I shoved the emerald medallion into his hand, silently praying he’d make it. I watched as he sped off, the sirens growing louder in the distance.

Now, back in the present, as I made my way to Martha’s home, a hundred things were going on in my head. The revolver in the small of my back, the snake skin in the lighthouse cabin, and the medallions—all of it felt like pieces of a puzzle I wasn’t sure I wanted to solve.

Upon reaching the guest house, I quickly opened the bedroom closet and placed the revolver in the bag, but kept the zip open so that I could reach for it at a moment's notice. But I kept the ruby medallion in my pocket. After freshening up, I left to meet Martha for lunch.

When I rang the doorbell, Alex greeted me at the door, dressed in an apron and ushered me inside. 

“Martha’s still in the kitchen,” he said, leading me to the living room.

From somewhere in the house, Martha’s cheerful voice called out, “I’m almost done, dear! Just a minute—make yourself at home.”

I sank into a cozy couch and glanced around the room. The house was modest yet inviting, and decorated with care.

A large TV dominated the center wall, with a single armchair angled toward it. The setup suggested quiet evenings spent alone.

 On one of the other walls were framed photographs, some featuring Martha alongside a man of similar age, their smiles frozen in happier times.

“That’s Henry, my husband,” Martha said from behind me, her voice soft but steady. I turned to see her pointing at one of the photos. “He passed away five years ago,” she added, as she served me a glass of iced tea.

Martha then took the seat across from me and we chatted about small, mundane stuff. When the moment felt right, I showed her Ben's photo and casually asked if she'd seen him, keeping my tone light to avoid suspicion.

She shook her head, frowning slightly. “No, dear. No one’s stayed at my guest house for quite some time. We don’t get many visitors around here,” she replied.

We spoke a bit more before she suggested we start lunch. 

By then, Alex had already set the table, arranging an inviting spread: roasted chicken, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, and a freshly baked apple pie. The aroma filled the room, making my stomach growl in anticipation.

“What will I do when you leave, kiddo?” Martha said, looking at Alex with a fond, wistful expression. “Our boy here will be heading off to Harvard this summer on a full scholarship to study law,” she added, turning to me, her voice filled with pride.

As we sat down, Martha served the food, moving deftly across the platters. The meal was as delicious as it looked, and the conversation flowed easily.

Then, as Martha reached across the table for more potatoes, something glinted at her neck.

I froze. The emerald medallion swung from a gold chain around her throat - its distinctive serpent coiling around an hourglass—impossible to miss.

My stomach clenched as my mind began to race.

Martha, even as she noticed the color draining from my face, calmly spooned more mashed potatoes onto her plate, her expression serene and almost nonchalant. Alex remained engrossed in his meal, while I shifted nervously in my seat. 

The food in my mouth no longer tasted as good, and was stuck at the back of my throat as I struggled to swallow, causing me to suddenly erupt into a coughing fit. As I tried to reach for my glass of water,my hand knocked it over sending it crashing to the floor. 

“Alex, why don’t you bring Emily another glass?” Martha intervened, gesturing toward the kitchen.

Before Alex could react, I stood up quickly, raising a hand to stop him. “I’ll get it,” I said, my voice abrupt.

I needed a moment away from them, away from the room.

In the kitchen, I gripped the counter, steadying myself as I reached for a glass. That’s when I heard it—clear and unmistakable.

“Elise… Elise… ELISE!”

The voice sent a jolt through me. It was Ben. It was Ben’s voice. My heart raced as I turned toward the hall.

The television, which had been off moments ago, was now turned on. A grainy video played on the screen, displaying security footage from the pawn shop.

My legs moved on their own, carrying me back into the living room where I collapsed into a chair, my knees almost giving away.

On the screen, the footage played like a nightmare brought to life.

There I was, standing in the shop, holding the medallions in both hands, my eyes locked in a daze, wild with desire as Ben started to speak louder and louder trying to get my attention. 

The shop assistant, Pete, looked alarmed, gesturing for me with his hands to put the medallions down.

But I ignored them both, my grip tightening as I stared at the medallions, mesmerized.

It wasn’t until Ben placed a firm hand on my shoulder and gave me a hard shake that I finally broke free from the spell.

Reluctantly, I set the medallions back on the tray, my fingers hesitating as if they didn’t want to let go.

When I turned to look at Ben, his expression was a curious mix of amusement and quiet resolve. 

But I knew him too well—behind that facade was the man I had fallen in love with, someone would do anything to give me what I wanted.

Even before he spoke, I could see it in his eyes. I knew exactly what he was about to do as he turned to face Pete.

“Okay. I think I’d like to buy these. What’s it going to cost?” he asked, looking at Pete.

Pete, already visibly annoyed, scoffed. “Oh, come on, Ben. I’m not in the mood for this. Just last month, you came here to sell your ring because you were short on cash.”

“I mean it,” Ben pressed, his voice unwavering. “I want to buy them. I don’t care if they’re cursed. Tell me what it’s going to cost.”

Pete glared at him, exasperated, before finally spitting out, “Three hundred thousand dollars.” His tone dripped with disdain as he eyed the two of us, clearly expecting Ben to back down.

I nudged Ben urgently, whispering that it was time to leave, but the air between the two men crackled with tension. As Pete moved to return the tray to its place, Ben and I turned eventually to leave the store—then he stopped abruptly.

What happened next was something I could never fully understand or admit to myself even after all these months. 

Ben’s face went cold, his expression vacant, like he’d fallen into a trance of his own. Without a word, he drew his revolver and fired.

The deafening shot echoed through the shop as Pete crumpled to the floor, lifeless. I gasped, my hands instinctively covering my mouth in shock.

Ben had always carried a firearm, but he wasn’t the kind of man to shoot first. He was not the trigger happy sort. In fact he had never aimed that weapon at another person before until that point. But now he stood motionless, his face unreadable.

“Pick up the medallions,” he said finally, his voice sharp and commanding.

Still in shock, I did as told, and together, we fled the shop, the medallions clutched tightly in my grasp.

The video suddenly came to a stop as the TV screen went blank. 

Except for the sound of my own breathing, the room fell silent and the silence became suffocating as I felt two pairs of eyes looking straight at me,waiting patiently for me to react. 

Summoning what little courage I had left, I forced myself to meet Martha's gaze. Her eyes were unwavering, cold and accusing, while her fingers absently fidgeted with the chain around her neck.

""My son, my only child is dead because of you,"" she said, her voice steady but quivering with restrained emotion. ""My flesh and blood. He was all I had left in this world, and you took him from me.""

""And all for what? For this?""

She lifted the medallion from her neck, its emerald surface faintly gleaming in the dim light. Her face twisted with grief and contempt as I sat frozen, guilt tightening around my chest, making me unable to respond.

""You came all this way looking for your boyfriend, didn’t you? So take it. Find out for yourself.""

Her words chilled me, but I slowly extended my  hand, picking up the medallion. The moment my fingers closed around it, a sharp, searing pain shot through my head, blurring my vision. My head snapped back as a vivid, horrifying vision unfolded before me.

Ben appeared, his face breaking into a smile as he looked down where a serpent lay coiled on the floor with its hood up. He poured milk into a shallow bowl, and the snake drank from it. The scene quickly shifted—Ben was now driving his car, the serpent wrapped around his arm. Each time the snake raised its hood, pointing left or right, Ben followed its silent command, turning the steering wheel accordingly.

The vision morphed again, this time to Martha's home. She sat on her couch, tears streaming down her face as she watched the security footage of her son’s murder on an endless loop. The sound of a doorbell broke her from her misery, and she opened the door to find Ben standing there, smiling as he introduced himself.

I gasped as the vision ended, my body jerking back so suddenly that my head throbbed painfully. My temples pulsed as though they might split open.

Then, the scene shifted again—Ben was lying on the floor, clutching his throat, foaming at the mouth, while Martha stood over him, holding a half-consumed glass of iced tea.

At the same time, I felt something physically wrong with me as well. My body burned, like a violent fever was overtaking me. Blood trickled from my nostrils and mouth, and it dawned on me—I had been poisoned, too. My mind flashed to the drink Martha had given me before the meal.

Dazed, I tried to rise from my seat, but my legs gave way, sending me crashing to the floor.

Alex rushed forward, steadying me with his hands as I struggled to stay conscious.

The moment his hands touched me, another vision surged through my mind with brutal force. 

Alex stood in Martha’s living room, a cleaver glinting in his grasp. The blade arced through the air and came down with horrifying precision, striking Ben several times, who already lay lifeless on the floor. 

The scene shifted again—Alex, burying Ben’s remains in shallow graves dug in the barren patch beside the house. Days flickered by as Alex and Martha worked side by side, planting seeds in the freshly turned soil. Weeks blurred together, and the once-empty patch became a lush garden. The plants thrived, nourished by the horror buried beneath.

The realization hit me like a truck: they had used those very vegetables from that garden to feed me. My stomach churned violently as the nausea overwhelmed me. Staggering to my feet, I bolted for the door, desperate for air.

I stumbled into the garden, gulping in deep breaths, but the moment I took in my surroundings, the nausea returned with full force. 

Doubling over, I retched, vomiting up the food I had just eaten, my body rejecting the horrifying truth.

When I turned back toward the house, Martha was standing there, watching me with a cold stare. Behind her, Alex loomed, clutching a large knife in his hand.

“Finish it,” she said, her voice steady and without remorse, as though this were a task no different from any other chore.

Panic surged through me as I fought my failing body from losing consiousness. I threw both my medallions to the floor, staggered to my feet, and rushed toward the guesthouse, instinct pulling me toward the closet where I’d hidden Ben’s revolver. 

As I reached the closet , my hands trembled as I fumbled with the handle, throwing the door open. 

A wave of relief washed over me when I saw the gun still lying there.

But my relief was short-lived. 

Coiled inside the cupboard, hidden among the shadows, was the serpent. Its eyes glinted in the dim light before it lunged, sinking its fangs deep into my throat.

Pain erupted like fire, spreading rapidly through my veins. My body seized as the venom took hold, the strength draining from my limbs. The gun slipped from my grasp and clattered to the floor.

 Darkness crept in at the edges of my vision, and I collapsed, the world fading as my consciousness slipped away.

When I woke, I had no sense of how much time had passed. My body felt light, as if it had been restored to full health, as though I'd been reborn. 

Ben's revolver lay beside me, cold and waiting. I picked it up and stepped out cautiously, only to freeze at the sight before me.

Martha was lying face down in the grass, her throat slit, a crimson pool spreading beneath her. Nearby, Alex stood motionless, his expression distant, as though caught in a trance. In his hand, he gripped a bloodied knife.

As I emerged, his eyes flickered to me, and he dropped to one knee. “Your Highness,” he murmured, holding the knife aloft like an offering to royalty.

 My eyes however darted between the raven and the serpent lying still in the grass, their unblinking eyes locked on me, and the two medallions glinting on the ground between them. 

Then, piercing through the suffocating silence, came the sound of sirens in the distance.

“What is happening?” I demanded, my voice trembling.

Alex’s gaze remained fixed on the ground. “It is the police,” he replied evenly. “I called them.”

“But why?” I asked, unable to hide my exasperation. 

“You must make a choice, Your Highness,” he said, his voice calm yet unyielding. “The medallions represent the future and the past. When you touched them for the first time, you became the natural custodian of the Auric Seals of Teotihuacan.”

His words sent a chill down my spine. “What does that mean?” I slowly asked.

“The medallions cannot be apart for long. They will always find a way back to one another, no matter the cost—through whatever means necessary. ”

“ You hold the power now to decide how this story unfolds”

The sirens grew louder, closer, like a ticking clock urging me toward a decision.

“Pick up the medallions, Your Highness,” Alex said, his tone commanding yet reverent.

I hesitated before reaching down. My fingers brushed the emerald-studded medallion, and a sharp pain shot through my forehead. A vision erupted in my mind—a harrowing glimpse of what was to come. I saw myself sitting on the grass, having abandoned the medallions and waiting for the police to arrive. Alex’s face, once composed, twisted into something unrecognizable. Without warning, he lunged at me, plunging the knife into my chest. The pain was visceral, and even within the vision, it left me gasping. I shuddered as the image dissolved.

My trembling hand moved to the ruby medallion. As I grasped it, another vision surged forward. This time, I saw myself running—driving away from the chaos as Alex charged toward the police, putting himself in harm's way in a desperate bid to buy me time. The visions faded, leaving me breathless and shaking. 

“Have you made your choice, Your Highness?” Alex asked a moment later, his voice steady but his gaze firmly fixed on the ground.

I swallowed hard, nodding.

“Then give me the gun,” he said softly, extending his hand.

Reluctantly, I placed the revolver in his palm. Alex bowed once, solemn and final, before turning and sprinting toward the approaching sirens. 

Shots rang out almost immediately as he fired at the sky before aiming his gun at the vehicles arriving in front of him. 

I stumbled toward my car, the medallions clutched tightly in my hands. The serpent slithered onto the passenger seat, coiling itself with an eerie calm. 

Overhead, the raven soared, charting a path forward as if guiding my escape. 

I started the engine, the tires screeching as the car surged forward,  speeding away just as a firefight ignited in the backdrop. 

The road stretched ahead, an uncertain future waiting to unfold.

What I did:

— I stopped doing IF, which I was doing for more than 3 years to no avail. I started eating breakfast (mainly sour dough+ eggs+cream cheese+ avocados).
— no bread or carbs after lunch.
— I started doing zone 2 running at a rate of twice a week , 3 to 4 miles per run .
— cross training 2 to 3 times a week. 
— I haven’t used sugar in my coffee for more than 6 years. So, no change to added sugar but I cut down on sugary snacks.

I’m pleased with this progress but I’m not stopping now. Actually , I feel much better after these changes and I intend to continue with this lifestyle.

Today's newsletter is once again brought to you by user '**drifthabimmer**.' Make sure to say 'thank you' in the comments!

[DOGElysses speaks!](https://preview.redd.it/t31dnrama15e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=248c7122ca781b13f6cdbef747cf05e65d2b32db)

Despite our otherwise unexciting, flat trading to the naked eye, institutions are duking it out right now for control over the shape of our principal trading paradigms. So today let's ask the following questions:

1. What is going on this week with our price action?
2. Do we moon?
3. Do we dip and \*then\* moon?

First: yes.

Now, yes - but with more words and some colors.

Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME Trading 12\/4 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/7a7x10y7j05e1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=35fc6072f3754d9d32ea6a16221be4dd40616d56)

Our support at $27 indeed held yesterday despite an attempt early to 'fake-out' dump the stock through the $27 gamma position and the technical support atop the 100-4hr SMA. This was bought back quickly once again and launched through the options market on an upside reversal into volatility suppression from our large Call Gamma position at $28. The stock then traded off of VWAP (around $27.50) before around 100,000 shares were shorted to shatter support at VWAP and bring the stock price back down to the Call-Gamma supported price at $27 where the price was pinned and ground sideways into a close just above $27.

[Here's that 100k short trade at around 1:10-1:15pm EST being closed and settled from 1:45pm-2pm. ](https://preview.redd.it/e46y4ikik05e1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9340c49a87ab4c46eabe8f697576b579b0c99abb)

We can also see the effects of order routing decisions by MMs taking their toll on the price. As I pointed out, this 100,000 share short trade hit the tape amid our low volume environment and caused a $0.50 move downward in the price. However, at 3:02pm a BULLISH trade of 144,000 shares came in. It's that huge volume bar on the chart toward EOD - our largest on the day. 

But, wait - why didn't this affect the price at all?

Oh, simple - it's because the Market Maker decided to route the order to a dark pool so that it would do anything to the price:

https://preview.redd.it/0gv1j8bil05e1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=0090d4db2aa8219486aea0a99c29a0ed6635bf74

Neat, huh? Big short orders come in, they hit the lit exchange so MM algorithms dump share hedges with it and the price drops. Equivalent or larger long orders come in and they get re-routed to a dark pool so it doesn't affect the price. Selective order flow routing!

So now we have a clearer picture of what we are up against going into earnings, namely ""price doesn't go up until we say it can, but it will go down whenever we want it to do so."" This is par for the course - nothing new - but it is also crucial to keep in mind right now as we head into earnings.

**Technicals**

[11\/15-12\/4 4hr-Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/22o7pttun05e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f7e73facf2d412d7e449bcbf88e31772dba9b3)

https://preview.redd.it/pxhl4n5kt05e1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea68731302f49baefce597410083ab4cba538ea

The first chart is my sketch from yesterday and the second is where we stand currently. Based on yesterday's more nuanced, but nonetheless manipulative interventions from institutional players, it appears to me like we have two 'camps' jockeying for position to get us to embrace one of these two scenario pathways. 

There sideways, neutral case which wants to keep us trading in the $27-$29 area for a longer period of time. This is something like the 'bull' camp. 

The second is a 'bear' camp that wants to see the move toward the 200-4hr SMA happen sooner so that the move can go deeper and make that unusual accumulation of $24 Puts we are seeing print.

We can visualize the clash of these two scenarios using conflicting statistical regression channels on our 4-hour chart:

[10\/25-12\/5 4-hr Aggregation; Green = Bull Trend Regression Channel; Red = Bear Trend Regression Channel](https://preview.redd.it/rizvva5mz05e1.png?width=1492&format=png&auto=webp&s=7033e4f5395f2b7a1874a81e9bb51ed808b3a375)

As you can see, the regression channel on our bull-trend (marked from the 10/28 upswing just prior to Cat Day) has had almost flawless overlay with a few of our moving averages, while our upper bound has lined up with our weekly highs over that period (I've been illustrating these same properties using just the most pertinent moving averages and RSI). 

However, we can see how Bears first walked us down within this broader, bullish regression channel and imposed a small bearish trend with its own regression channel of about 50% the standard deviation of the larger channel. Right now, Bears threaten to eject us from this Bull channel and the stock is at a crossroads. Bulls are fighting to keep us trading above the lower bound of our Bull trend's channel, while bears want to assert the dominance of their trend and drive us today into the lower half of their own regression channel, the lower bound of which, if it stays intact, will intersect with the 200-4hr SMA essentially today.

 There is also a rare, very narrow window of structural weakness in our options chain and MM GEX around $25 which stands as evidence to this intention on the part of the Bears:

https://preview.redd.it/u40724kiv05e1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=f52493903e16a93865aaf67ed1ba4b0a67a41c01

For 12/13 expiry, every strike from $27 to $22 is Put-Gamma dominant. As we shall see, this is not true of these strikes as a composite total across \*every\* expiry currently. However, whoever is holding these contracts for next week currently will profit more the sooner and faster the stock price moves into this area.

While this bearish scenario is not a foregone conclusion at this point, we do stand at a 'knife's edge' so to speak. If Bears could have this move today, they'd have it today. Only institutional Bulls have the ability to stop this scenario from unfolding. The crucial battleground will be the $27.25-$27.50 area during the first half of the trading day. This is where the 20-4hr SMA in alignment with the top of the Bearish regression channel intersects with the 100-4hr SMA and the bottom of our Bullish regression channel. 

In fact, the battle is already raging in the Pre-Market today:

[The question: is this an attempt at a bullish recovery or a bearish feint to set up an opening assault to the downside?](https://preview.redd.it/d53r8ecc315e1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=91eb1f2a5bd7c27d4b63d30ae96d50e75ea541a5)

In the short term, I lack the necessary information to say who will win this clash, though yesterday's trickery from the Bearish camp - shorting and rerouting the bullish counterattack to a dark pool - took the upper hand. 

However, even if this bearish camp gets their way before earnings, this does not challenge any of the fundamental or longer-term outlook points with reflect to the stock and would likely set-up a sizable upside reversal.

Let's take a look at our options data further now to investigate and illustrate this point.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Although our total share volume stayed elevated yesterday, the total value of options premiums traded halved versus Tuesday:

https://preview.redd.it/dpyrspx6515e1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f242e5e9a22048a981991cf290a2744a1a75575

We can see that accordingly new OI for this week was basically neutral:

[12\/6 OI Changes 12\/4-12\/5](https://preview.redd.it/nkq5favs415e1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=b716cd896ab97486bc5c04819915b2c6c67f03be)

We got a mix of new long and short Calls in the lower end of our Bullish channel - so the $27.50 to $30 range - while a trickle of new Puts built up across our bearish channel - $27 down to $24. Most of our new OI was spread across strikes for 12/13 expiry instead:

[12\/13 OI Changes 12\/4-12\/5](https://preview.redd.it/cx4x47a1615e1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=193ac0aab75fbb51c33594332482c550bfde33d9)

We can see especially how traders opened new Puts in modest numbers down around the $24-$25 area to anticipate the unfolding of the bearish scenario and capture value off of the quick prospective thrust downward.

With that being said, our Max Pain data still shows more elevated marks for our near term expiries:

https://preview.redd.it/60gp7dyds05e1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c1626c649f5ca88a6f7b7cfcfa7677c74c76b8

While Max Pain does not have anything to tell us about sentiment, Market Makers don't appear to have much incentive to push the price much farther below or above our current mark, but rather to keep things ultimately closing the week out in the $26-$27 range to optimally profit from their dealership strategies.   


**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/k731thnvp05e1.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d381c8a587ad50980d2a8714316f2658b9b2019

Slowly, but surely we can see in our Put-to-Call GEX ratio that we have negative gamma exposure building in the market. While Call GEX is increasing it is increasing at a slower rate than Put GEX, thus bringing about this elevated ratio approach 1:2. 

https://preview.redd.it/iuh4ypjsp05e1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=804afc4f2d1c9779252e0ea1c9e203c59c363c6f

We can see the effects of this here in our daily MM hedging structure. The $25.50-$26.50 range beneath us has negatized and projects some modest downside volatility should we not quickly reclaim $27 as an intraday support upon Market Open. 

For many of you who might have only joined us after the dog days of Summer (the end of our Bear Trend and move into a range-bound trading structure) Put Gamma-dominant Options positions are something quite foreign. A Put-dominant position behaves differently than a Call-dominant position insofar as all of the MM hedging pressures are reversed in relation to options flow. 

As a Call-dominant positions offers intraday offers volatility suppression as it is approached, thereby increasing the amount of premium required to move the price through high-Call Gamma zones, Put-dominant positions cause MMs to hedge in SYMPATHY with the direction of options flow. Thus, an area of high Put-Gamma causes the price to slip and slide as it is approached. This is to say that \*less\* premium is required on the part of the options market to move the price through a Put-Gamma dominant area.

While the $25.50-$26.50 is not a \*crazy\* Put dominant area, our premarket price position below $27 - to say nothing of the obvious institutional efforts to control the price into this position yesterday - does encourage the options market to run us down all the way to the $25 high Call-Gamma position on a slippery path of least resistance. 

With that being said, if Bulls are determined enough, they could keep on the pressure to keep us up, as they may be trying to orchestrate presently in premarket trading where their dollars go farther. If they can sustain the price above $27.50 and challenge $28, then the stability of the that range might be enough to keep us trading around our present price into the end of the week. However, the uncertainty of the present conflict between bulls and bears may be too much to disincentivize the broader options market from charging in behind bulls even in the event they are successful. If bulls are to win, they will need to be substantially successful at clearly reasserting the integrity of their trend and channel.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/qbp9lp7ci05e1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=99bf30ee94a5d12ae3fabf6316aaa39a9e002b8f

https://preview.redd.it/i02cub1ji05e1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f670985590b002584954c1312011e88add34b47a

As we can see, despite our flat, downward price action, our general IV trend has stayed appreciative overall. This pushes me further toward the conclusion that we do have a latent earnings IV effect churning in the background of our price action and obscured by our recent bullish volatility. This suggests that we can expect some manner of IV crush after earnings next week independent of our price action.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

The Bull-Bear battle is on and Bears pulled a few sneakies to snag the upper hand yesterday and finally eject us from the Bull trend we've been inhabiting for the last month. If Bulls can scrape together a rally and place us in a stable trading range above $27.25, the current position of our 100-4hr SMA at the time of publication, there is a chance we will still be able to cling to our trend into 12/6 expiry. If Bulls are unsuccessful, or if this bullish movement in the premarket is actually a Bearish feint, then the path is pretty clear to slip down toward our deepest technical and hedging support at $25 in short order.

Things might seem a little gloomy in this respect in the short term. However, in times like these, we can always widen our purview and remember the core aspects of the investment thesis - the Cat, the Dog, and the Transformation - as well as the tremendous strides the Stonk has taken YTD and on longer timeframes.

A lot of you have been very generous to treat me to coffee for these posts either by finding my link or by directly sending me coffee in the mail (thank you, Keith & Tabitha!). I am extremely grateful to all of you. I want to make sure everyone is recognized for their generosity. However, from now on the running list of donors will be posted only on my user profile such as not to suggest advertisement.

As a separate note, at times my posts have been inexplicably taken down and blocked from repost due to anonymous complaints independent of moderator activity. If there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter everyday in the Articles tab of my profile on X @ MichaelTLoPiano. If on some day in the future my post is taken down, I will then repost that day's issue to my Reddit user profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, these back-up crosspostings will in no way affect my attention here or ever be put behind a paywall.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and $GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

Here are 6 key trends that are shaping the future of influencer marketing—backed by data, of course. 📊

# 1. Micro-Influencers Are Taking Over

You don’t need millions of followers to make an impact anymore. **Micro-influencers (10k-100k followers)** are dominating campaigns thanks to their engaged, niche audiences.

📌 **Facts:**

* Micro-influencers see an **engagement rate of 3.86%**, compared to 1.21% for mega-influencers (Source: Influencer Marketing Hub, 2024).
* Brands partnering with multiple micro-influencers report **30% higher ROI** than using a single celebrity.

**Why It Matters:** Authenticity wins. Smaller influencers connect better with their followers, making their recommendations more trustworthy.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Collaborate with micro-influencers in niche categories for laser-focused targeting.

# 2. AI is Transforming Campaigns

Artificial Intelligence is no longer a buzzword—it’s a game-changer in influencer marketing. From finding the perfect influencer to analyzing campaign results, AI tools are doing it all.

📌 **Facts:**

* AI reduces influencer vetting time by **70%** by analyzing engagement, audience demographics, and fake followers.
* Brands using AI tools see a **20% boost in campaign performance** (Source: HypeAuditor, 2024).

**What’s Cool:** Tools like Upfluence and AspireIQ use AI to match brands with influencers who genuinely align with their values and goals.

# 3. The Short-Form Video Boom

If you’re not doing short-form video, you’re missing out. Platforms like **TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts** are where the action is. TikTok’s explosive growth isn’t slowing down, and YouTube is aggressively pushing Shorts.

📌 **Facts:**

* **88% of consumers** prefer short-form video for discovering new products (Source: Wyzowl, 2024).
* TikTok is expected to surpass **2 billion monthly active users** by late 2025.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Don’t just repurpose content—create platform-specific campaigns. TikTok thrives on trends, while Instagram Reels values aesthetics.

# 4. Creator Commerce is the New Norm

Influencers are no longer just promoting products—they’re becoming entrepreneurs themselves. Think exclusive product drops, live shopping events, and affiliate marketing on steroids.

📌 **Facts:**

* Live shopping will account for **$70 billion** in U.S. sales by the end of 2025 (Source: eMarketer).
* Influencers co-creating products with brands see **2x higher sales conversions** than traditional partnerships.

**Example:** Emma Chamberlain’s coffee brand or D’Amelio family collabs are the blueprint for this new era of creator-led commerce.

# 5. Long-Term Partnerships > One-Off Campaigns

Quick shoutouts are dead. Consumers are tired of seeing influencers jump from one brand to the next. Long-term collaborations feel more authentic and build trust.

📌 **Facts:**

* **63% of consumers** trust influencers more when they promote the same brand repeatedly over time (Source: Nielsen, 2024).
* Brands with multi-year influencer contracts report a **40% increase in customer loyalty.**

💡 **Pro Tip:** Focus on building lasting relationships with influencers who genuinely align with your brand’s values.

# 6. Metrics That Actually Matter

Likes and shares are cute, but in 2025, brands care about deeper metrics like **sales, audience sentiment, and retention.**

📌 **Facts:**

* **80% of brands** now measure ROI by direct conversions (affiliate links, promo codes, etc.) instead of vanity metrics.
* Tools like Sprout Social and Socialbakers help brands analyze sentiment and calculate customer acquisition cost from influencer campaigns.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Track everything. Use unique promo codes or UTM links to tie results directly to your campaigns.

# What Does This Mean for You?

📣 **For Brands:** Invest in authenticity, embrace tech, and prioritize platforms where your audience is most active.  
📣 **For Influencers:** Stay adaptable, focus on building trust, and lean into commerce opportunities like affiliate programs and product lines.

My new routine in the weekday mornings is simple. I wake up, feed the cats (I have 2). I make breakfast and fix coffee. I eat. I hop on my elliptical for up to an hour. 

I was a gym rat when I was a teenager, so the elliptical at home is my way of coping with the responsibility and structure of corporate adulthood lol. I have various equipment but the elliptical is the one that I'm sticking to in the mornings in order to get a good workout in and get back into shape.

During this time, my kitty has gotten progressively more and more curious about momma suddenly getting on an elliptical every morning. The elliptical is by the couch in my sunroom, which I've converted into a mini fitness center. One day he started hanging off the couch and meowing to get my attention. Now one thing about this cat to note: he's quiet. So if he is meowing something is wrong. But I knew he was fed and had water and a clean litterbox. 

I decided to humor myself. ""Does the baby want uppies?"" I asked him and scooped him up while I continued to bike. Dude started purring. I had to stop because I started laughing. I let him bike with me for about 5 minutes. I put him down. He started it up again. So I picked him back up and we would do 5-10 minutes at a time of me holding him, putting him down because he gets heavy after so long, and then him kicking up a fuss so I picked him up again.

It has been a week of this now and I'm starting to think it's a routine.

Why does he do this?? I noticed he tries to bury his head into my sweaty armpits so I don't know if it's just him trying to get as much of my scent as possible? But like dude.. we live together.. how much more do I need to smell like you and you like me?

Anyone else can relate?? Or am I doomed to be the crazy gym rat cat mom now?",1,1733406541.0,cats,0,1.0,False
1h79k40,https://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/1h79k40/im_watching_lost_circle_its_really_interesting_to/,"I'm watching LOST: Circle, it's really interesting to watch it this way","It's a fan-made chronological edit of LOST someone on Reddit hooked me up with. It's really cool. 

I've noticed that I actually respond differently, feel differently about certain characters. A prime example is I actually greatly empathise with John Locke watching his story in chronological order, and it really helps to understand him better. As a young lad this strange man with mega eyelashes visits him and implies he might be special, might be suitable for a special school so it's maybe laying the groundwork to give him this sense of self-importance, to make him believe he has a great purpose from a young age. But more to the point in his adult life you see how downhill it is from when his mum comes back into his life. She sets him on that path, and you see him become more pathetic and broken until the point he then becomes literally broken. It's so sad to watch, and without it being inter-cut with some of his atrocious behaviour and actions on the island it makes me empathise with him much more.

It's edited really well as well. I'm just now in Season 1 episode 10 Periodicity, where Hugo is posing for a photo with Dave, but then it really surprised me when it cut to an over shoulder shot of a woman watching Hugo pose with no one and then the slow pan to reveal it's Libby. I'd never seen these two moments edited together like that, so it's kind of an ""Ohhhhh yeahhhhh"" moment. And last I saw Libby she was chatting with Desmond in the coffee shop... who's now on the island with Kelvin Inman. While also Juliet's on the island.

It's great watching it like this. Interesting how much the tables turn in a manner of speaking as well, like Titus Welliver is only in the first season of LOST: Circle instead of 5 and 6. Alpert is significantly in season 1, Ben, Roger, Horace, Juliet, Desmond. 

Definitely recommend it if you haven't watched it.",3,1733406511.0,lost,2,1.0,False

1h79jim,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1h79jim/update_my_workmate_left_pretty_bad_instructions/,UPDATE: My workmate left pretty bad instructions and my boss finally caught on,"I'd like to preface this by saying that we work remotely from our manager (he's in Europe and we're in Asia), so whatever he hears from us he considers to be *true*. Furthermore, my manager has been the most reasonable and understanding boss I've had in my career, almost everyone who's been under his supervision had only good things to say even after they left the company. And lastly, I do know that part of this was also my fault.

Which leads me to the meeting earlier — I admitted that all of this could've been avoided if I raised the flag the second I didn't agree with what John said. My manager being a reasonable guy, didn't really get mad but gave a stern reminder that I should always be transparent every time there's a problem. During the conversation, my manager was really focused on asking the ""why"" question. Why John didn't leave proper documentation on the reports, why the reports were connected to local files on his laptop, why was there little time spent on the knowledge transfer. As much as I don't want to jeopardize John's career, bossman really wanted to get to the bottom of this, having me eventually just tell the full truth with full confidentiality, at least that's what he said.

John isn't really interested in learning the product of the client, making it very hard for him to understand the process and sharing that knowledge to anyone. He also has a habit of frequently going out to go to a coffee shop and just kill time, you'd seldom see him glued to his seat, even if most of us just stay at the office during downtime in case something urgent happens that need our immediate attention. He doesn't enjoy learning new tools, hence why his reports would seem archaic and has visibily no improvement in efficiency (both in file size and run time). 

And these are the things I shared to my manager. I could've told other things as well just to build my case — like how he sleeps at work because he has two other part-time jobs keeping him up at night, how he'd regularly leave office earlier during weekends to catch a flight to go to his girlfriend, and how some reports he had were inaccurate but other teammates fixed it before the client and our manager could notice it. He's a redflag for employers, which is why what happened is the one and only time I'll be covering for him.

After hearing all of these, my manager just reminded me to just be transparent and to not ley something like this happen again. He'll be onboarding me moving forward, and have instructed the rest of the team to have documentation on all reports by next Q1 2025. He then told a story avout a previous workmate of ours that he fired because of the same things that John was doing. He'll be conducting investigations on John's in-and-out of the office and will push on him to optimize reports so he can have a more *permanent* solution for him.",35,1733406461.0,MaliciousCompliance,5,0.77,False

Regular work in my industry has been difficult to obtain with my limited contacts here, so this week I began applying to food and beverage jobs to make some more money in the meantime. I got an interview at a coffee shop which is within my realm of past experience. 

It’s the day of the interview, I’m on my way there and I hit some traffic, it’s a 4pm interview and I’m driving across town. Let me be clear, I understand that I should have left enough time for this unforeseen traffic but I didn’t in this situation, I like to think that I’m capable of learning from this mistake. 

I show up at the coffee shop, and I’m standing at the from door at 4:02. It’s locked, lights are off, no one is around. I knock on the door and send the interviewer a message on indeed since they haven’t given me their phone number, I also call the business phone, no answer. 

In my head I’m literally like, this person forgot that we have an appointment. 

So after waiting in my car for 10min or so, I go into the adjoining business, it’s a an espresso machine repair shop so I figured they probably know each other. 

Someone answers the door, I explain that I’m supposed to meet the owner but they haven’t shown up. The machine repair person says they know the owner and then checks the backdoor camera on her phone to see if his car is parked in his usual spot and it is. So they bring me to through the back and into the coffee shop because the business were connected, they’re calling his name looking around but no one is there. They check their phone again, his car is gone. It’s now 4:20 or so, he has clearly just left the premises. 

The person helping me gives him a call and explains that I am there and had arrived at 4:02. The coffee shop owner goes on a rant to the person who I have now unknowingly involved in all this drama about how he expects his employees to be on time and how it’s a bad look to show up late to an interview etc. I leave, thank her and go on bewildered at the lack of communication. 

As a person who has taken thousands of appointments in my career I personally know that I would never do this to someone without attempting to contact them and at least waiting 5-10min to at least have a conversation. 

So who is in the wrong? It has been half of a day but I’m having a hard time getting over this, I do feel like I dodged a bullet and I can only imagine how irritating this person could be to deal with as a supervisor so I really just want to stop thinking about it. Alternatively I’m embarrassment for not arriving early but I’m also feeling a sense of injustice maybe? I just want to hear the redditor’s opinions on this one.

The story is very good, and I liked how the manuscripts had little backstories+information about what was going to happen in that episode. It was a very unique way of storytelling. I saw people complaining about the gameplay online, but I had no problems. Its pretty obvious that the game doesn't want you to kill everything and sometimes just want you to run towards the light. The radio was the perfect way to add character to the town of bright falls.

Now, I have one complaint. As you can probably guess from my pfp, I am a huge twin peaks fan. I love almost everything david lynch makes and understand almost none of them. And alan wake used a lot of twin peaks stuff, a LOT. It got to a point where it was a little too much on the nose. I didn't have a problem with bright falls being inspired by the town of twin peaks. But the way oh deer diner looks, the type of character rose is, the sheriff loving black coffee were all copied from the show. The lamp lady is almost an exact copy of a character from twin peaks. The trailer park looked too similar to the trailer park in twin peaks fire walk with me. I went from,""hey! thats a twin peaks reference!"" to ""this game has a LOT of stuff similar to twin peaks.""

Being inspired is one thing but copying something is another. That's the main issue I had with the game. Overall, I'd rate it 4/5. It has a very good story, an unique way of storytelling and has very compelling characters",4,1733406075.0,AlanWake,4,1.0,False

I'm retired, so I rarely need to get up at a certain time (though it's usually stupid early anyway), so a regular programmable maker doesn't fit the bill.

When I do wake up, I say ""Good morning, Alexa"" and that triggers a routine with a number of simple actions. I would very much like to add starting the coffee maker to that list. I'd really like the coffee to be ready by the time I've brushed my teeth, etc., rather than go downstairs, start it, go back up, do what I have to do, go back down to get my coffee, go back up to my office, where I normally start my day. Yes, I'm lazy.

My current coffee maker is a Keurig Elite. I bought it second hand and it works fine. It makes a single large cup, which is all I drink in a day. I'm open to other brands and makers that offer both single cup and carafe options. I'm not a huge fan of glass carafes or heating elements; if has a carafe, I'd prefer an insulated stainless steel one, with no heater. And of course I'd prefer not to break the bank.

It's not the best coffee but it's good enough for my and the mrs.

You can get one for about £40 used but I would happily pay up to £100 (preferably more like £60-80 but I'd spend the extra if it was worth it) for a better machine.

I've looked around and found the Gaggia Brera for £80 but I quite like having the little handle that you put the coffee in (sorry I don't know all the lingo) but this machine is one of those super automatic ones. I would love something that grinds the beans for you though.

Ideally I'd get the Breville/Sage barista express but this is more like £200 used so it's a bit out of my price range.

Are there any common machines that are a bit of a middle ground?

Amateur coffee brewer here. Ive just got my breville express impress and have been playing around with beans and settings for a while. I think i found my ideal beans but when brewing im still getting a 1:2 shot volume in 20-22 seconds
Even though i am literally the finest setting in the

Note please that due to size of portafilter im brewing only 15-16g instead of 18. Whenever o dose 18 it overflows even with a dosing ring and when I use light beans.",1,1733405791.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I do practically all the cooking at home. She has a smaller appetite than me, and is a more picky eater, so we've had conversations in the past about how we should tackle it, but no matter what we come up there's always problems. A couple examples:

* I make her breakfast and coffee in bed pretty much every morning. She can't eat anything complicated, so its usually cereal or oatmeal. If there's too much milk, not enough sugar, etc, it ruins her appetite and she usually doesn't eat any of it, even after correcting the dish. 
* I don't eat meat, and she's not a huge meat eater, but I've often bought and cook meat for her per her request. I'll make the same base meal for us both and just add meat to hers. She often doesn't eat more than a few bites of it, and almost never eats it all.
* Sometimes when she's hungry she'll ask me to make a snack for her, and I'll give her a couple options, one of which will usually make her excited. But when I serve it to her, there's a 50/50 chance she either doesn't touch it, or takes one bite and loses her appetite. 
* Relatively often she'll get a beer, open it, and not take a single sip, just leaving it out all night. 
* When I serve dinner, she'll often let it sit until its cold before eating it. She says its because its usually too hot, and she is hungry, but when she gets around to it its too cold and she doesn't eat or reheat it.
* Sometimes we'll find a dish she really likes, but if we eat it more than a few times in a month she'll get turned off it for a long time.

You can see why I'm looking for help. I understand it's not because she's lazy or doing it on purpose, but I'm at a loss. We've had a lot of conversations about it, where I'm always careful not to sound judgmental or guilt trip her, ""I feel"" statements and all that. She's always very apologetic, and can't really describe what the issue is. She'll describe foods she doesn't eat as ""weird"", or say she's just not hungry, or that she cant multitask (watch tv and eat) but I dont think she actually understands it herself. She'll say she's not hungry, then ask for food a half hour later. Call one food ""weird"" and eat it, and not eat another she describes the same way - and I've seen her eat and watch tv all the time. 

She's not lying, I think she just doesn't understand it and is trying to be helpful. We've talked about it so much and tried so many different solutions; her plating her own portions, helping cooking, sticking to ""safe"" dishes, but none of it helps for long. I'm worried because she's quite thin and it's gotten to the point where she'll wake up at night crying in pain because of hunger. It's gotten worse since she's begun on her finals, but the issue has always been there, so I'm just hoping someone out there has experienced something similar and, I don't know, give advice? Reassurance? I love her so much, and really want to help.

Comments:
“More werpa sa ulam mo lods!”
“Rapsa naman niyan solid”
“Napakapetmalu naman ng ulam mo lods penge naman”

 It was so fun and nakakagaan ng loob kasi people are just supporting each other with the food they’re currently eating kahit hindi aesthetic, kahit hindi “authentic” basta mukang masarap. Para talagang community siya where people are just appreciating people’s current ulam. Umabot sa point na people are sharing their very own recipes and their “new ulam creations.” Eto din yung era na sumikat si Ninong Ry kasi share lang siya ng share ng recipes niya.

Ngayon na nag gain na ng traction group, medyo naiirita na ko sa mga tao doon. Ang snob and kupal na ng mga tao doon. Instead of lutong ulam ang pinopost, puro restaurant recommendations, coffee/tea shops, etc. Ang rami ding kuda na puro criticism and sometimes insulting.

“Ay di naman authentic adobo mo eh”
“Di naman masarap diyan eh”
“Ang mahal naman niyan, dito ka na lang sa x”
“Kadiri naman yan. Mas okay pa kung…”
“Wag ka diyan kumain, dito ka na lang sa resto na to”

Parang nawala na yung true essence ng group; yung sense of community na nabuo through sharing ng kani-kanilang ulam. Naging avenue na lang siya ng resto/coffee/tea recommendations and promotions. 

Although may mga nag sshare pa rin ng mga recipes nila, natatabunan na lang sila ng recommendations and promotions of restos/coffee/food business.

Dati I randomly post my ulam either twice or thrice a week. Ngayon parang lurker na lang ako kasi ayoko mainsulto just because yung ulam ko is “not up to their standands.”

2 days ago our son (6 weeks) had a small amount of blood in his poopy diaper. I immediately called the pediatrician, they had me bring in his next diaper for labs. Now OBVIOUSLY we saw the blood so there would be traces of it on the labs. This didn't occur to me until way after we brought it in because I was just worried. At the time, the nurse mentioned a possible CMPI, but she'd call back with results and we'd go from there.

Well naturally I immediately jumped on Google as you do, and started researching CMPI. He doesn't really have any other clearcut symptoms. He was pretty fussy, but the nurse suspected he was going through a growth spurt, and over the last couple of days his fussiness has gotten better. He hasn't had any blood since that first day. 

So the nurse calls back this morning and says the doctor reviewed, wasn't surprised with the blood in the labs since we SAW blood earlier that day, and that we should wait and see if it resolves itself. If it happens again we'll talk about CMPI but for now wait and see.

I'm a bi guy but haven't been in a long term relationship with anyone in a long time, which seems to confuse my friends. I'm not unattractive, I have a decent job, hobbies, and a close social circle that keeps me happy and fulfilled. But all of this doesn't seem to be enough for my friends.

In the past few years I've asked a few men and women out and it just didn't work for one reason or another. I'm still friends with most of them and happy that they're still in my life. However, the most recent date I went on caused a bit of a stir with my friends.

I asked this nice woman that I know out for coffee about 2 months ago and it went well. We run in the same social circles and had lots to talk about, but at the end of the date she said she wasn't interested in me romantically. No big deal, she was very sweet about it and I was happy that we could stay friends and be comfortable seeing each other around. About a week later she started dating a good friend of mine and I thought they were a great match! My other friends acted like it was some drama but I honestly didn't care. I was happy that my friends were happy and didn't want any childish nonsense. After about 2 weeks they broke it off and 2 weeks later she approached me and asked if I wanted to go out again. I turned her down. She was understanding and I thought everything was fine.

I don't know how to explain it but once I know that someone isn't attracted to me romantically all the feelings of romantic attraction that I have just disappear. They're still my friend but I can't ever get that romantic feeling back, idk, maybe I'm on the aro/ace spectrum or something.

My friends found out about this and then started a full inquisition about why I said no. I told them that I wasn't attracted to her, which confused them because I had asked her out 2 months ago. When I explained that those feelings disappeared when she said she wasn't into me they got even more confused. It's like they thought I was in denial or something just because I'd been rejected. After an hour long conversation about this, one of my friends said, ""well I guess this why you're always single"", which confused me. I asked what she meant and she explained that if I wasn't willing to hold onto feelings of attraction after rejection then I'd never actually find someone because that's just how dating is, you have to hold on and fight for the attention of the person you're attracted to. My other friends mostly agreed, though a few were on my side.

At the end of the night I just felt super judged and ""weird"" and when I asked if my feelings were accurate, the friend who made the comment just said ""yeah, I guess"".

I just don't get it! Why would I hold onto feelings that will make me miserable instead of just being an adult and moving on? Why am I expected to ""fight"" for the affection of someone else? And why is not doing so deemed ""weird"" or ""childish"". I'm just so confused and pissed that this is the standard.

I(28M) think my Gf(25F) is not being honest. We started dating at the beginning of last year and were together for most of it. The second half of our relationship was exclusive, but there were issues and she often seemed distant and not very affectionate.
There were a few times when she admitted to flirting and talking to other people. Whenever I brought it up, she’d either change the subject or brush it off, saying it was just harmless fun. She also had hangouts with male friends alone, had at odd hours of the night and would delete the chats from her“friends.” She even admitted to emotionally cheating, both in person and through messages, saying she liked the attention and validation from other men and stringing them along 
We had many conversations about it, and she promised it would stop, but eventually, she pulled away and broke up with me. She gave a different reason for the breakup, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the other issues played a role.

Within the year she reached out, apologized for everything, and admitted that the “friends” weren’t as innocent as she made them out to be. We talked about getting back together and agreed on a committed, communicative relationship with just the two of us. Things seemed great, almost perfect and really grew as people together , and we discussed how we’d handle things better this time.
She had to leave town for a few months for work and the commute was too hard to keep up with so we continued while she was gone via text and call, and when she came back , things were good for a few weeks. she received a message from an old male friend out of nowhere from a person she claimed she didn't have any real communicating with and he randomly messaged her and asked her, and she planned to go with him for some tea and coffee . When I asked about who he was, she shut it down immediately and defensively told me she won't be argueing and said this is what is happening and refused to let me speak my feels because she didn't care about my feelings and it's a me problem,  She said she wasn’t asking for permission, got frustrated, and told me I was overreacting and controlling. She also made comments about how I should just trust her and shouldn’t question her actions. Mentioned she doesn't care what I do, It felt like things flipped back to the way they were before, where I didn’t matter and not actually loved
I really don’t want to be controlling, but after everything we’ve been through, I can’t help but feel uneasy. She insists it’s just a harmless meetup, but I’m worried that history is repeating itself. I don’t want to overthink or ruin what we’ve rebuilt, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off.

Am I being unreasonable?

Maybe some people will just find this funny, but I'm really hurting. So please be kind, there is a real person on the other end.

This year, I’ve had the incredible luck of having something real with several women who responded to my R4Rs. It took a lot of reading replies, conversations that led nowhere, or where the we weren't quite right for each other. But every so often, a true diamond jumped out from the first interation. Each one was remarkable - intelligent, charming, accomplished, and *""my kind""* of beautiful. There was instant, electric chemistry that felt almost unreal. The conversations would flow without pause, and the hours would fly by without notice. Every time, I thought, “This could be something special.” And every time, just as I started to let my guard down, just as they are declaring how much they are falling for me (sometimes even the next day), I got the same message: they’re feeling too much, falling too hard; they're intimidated by me, or overwhelmed by how amazing they think I am. They weren’t prepared for those feelings, and ran for the hills (thankfully with a parting message, at least).

A female friend of mine told me, “You can be a little intimidating. It’s like, why is the seemingly almost perfect guy on Reddit?” And maybe that’s part of the problem. I turned to Reddit to meet someone special, and I found the place for me, like-minded people, the place I always should have been on. Because the usual dating apps never seemed to work for me. I get matches by the dozen, but it's poignantly superficial. All the filters in the world can't narrow down the pool to  the kind of deep, authentic connections with curious, interesting, maybe slightly nerdy or goofy but downright adorable people I’m looking for. Apps, with their focus on physical looks first, then light chitchat before a quick coffee date - it doesn't do it for me, and the kind of person who wants that isn't right for me. I adore getting to know someone slowly, through meaningful conversations, beyond surface-level small-talk. That's the way I feel I can truly connect. Like anyone else on Reddit, I’m just trying to navigate life and dating, albeit with my own quirks, experiences, and maybe different looks. Often on here, when I share photos people think I'm catfish, but once that trust is established the connection is like nothing else. The last one even tested me, by giving me a fake unappealing description of herself to see how I'd react, only giving me her photo and number once I responded to that gallantly and respectfully.

I find myself back in the dating pool in my 30s, with serious relationships behind me, so there’s a lot to juggle: responsibilities, a mortgage tying me down for the medium term, a diminishing circle of friends who are available regularly to head out and meet people. And maybe that's also intimidating to some women, paradoxically something they feel they want in a man but don't deserve. Yet it’s a new phase of life where I’m still figuring things out, just like anyone else. And all I really want is to find that click with someone who unlocks my charm, someone who makes everything else fade into the background for a moment.

I get it. If someone struggles with self-worth, attention from a guy who seems “almost perfect” on paper might set off alarm bells. Why is he interested in me? What’s he really after? How long until he’s bored? And those are fair questions. We all need caution with strangers until trust is built, and online makes that more crucial. But that presumption reduces me to an idealised, one-dimensional image, not a person with my own flaws, feelings, and uncertainties. Like them, I’m just trying to figure out life, and share that journey with someone who completes me.

 I know I’m worth more than just flirty messages or surface-level charm. I have so much affection, support, growth to share. But when a Reddit connection deepens and real feelings start to form, it seems that’s exactly when the walls go up. And at some point it makes me feel like for some women I'm great for ogling and fantasising about, enjoying flirting and passion, but too intimidating for something real.

I understand these sudden cut-offs say more about their insecurities - need for validation, abandonment issues, fear of commitment - than it does about me. Rationally, I know that. But each time, it inevitably chips away at me a little more. One person’s lack of self-worth can grind down another’s over time. I can’t help but wonder: after spending years caring for myself - my mind, my physical and mental health, my style, cmy career,my self-worth - maybe it would it be easier I weren’t so much of a “temptation”? Would women connect with me better if I ticked fewer boxes? If I presented myself as  less... put together? What even is the rationale for that? I can only be true to myself, and be me; anything else seems manipulation.

I’m not looking for perfection. I’m looking for someone real, someone who wants to build something meaningful together. Someone whose flaws aren't flaws to me, but adorable markers of her uniqueness,and reminders of everything I find amazing about her.

So how do you keep going when ticking all the right boxes, or being “too perfect”, makes seemingly amazing connections flame out, makes wonderful people feel insecure and run? How do you approach working on that together and overcoming it as a team, when they will listen to their flight instinct on an impulse? How d o you stay hopeful that the next connection will be different?

since then (7 months) i lost 60 pounds sleep well eat well exercise, my BP is down to slightly elevated levels.

the only thing i didn't change was my coffee drinking, but i decreased it a while back before the bp problem, and i only drink twice a day, morning and noon.

Today i started halving my caffeine intake and i was wondering how long will i see a difference?

Interesting, i have a machine at home that is like the old one we had at work so in Friday and Saturday i had the ""normal"" caffeine levels.

Its funny because usually on this sub people ask about stopping or starting anti-hypertensive drugs. while I'm now asking about a Pro-hypertensive drug (aka coffee).",1,1733404622.0,hypertension,4,1.0,False

Maybe some people will just find this funny, but I'm really hurting. So please be kind, there is a real person on the other end.

This year, I’ve had the incredible luck of having something real with several women who responded to my R4Rs. It took a lot of reading replies, conversations that led nowhere, or where the we weren't quite right for each other. But every so often, a true diamond jumped out from the first interation. Each one was remarkable - intelligent, charming, accomplished, and *""my kind""* of beautiful. There was instant, electric chemistry that felt almost unreal. The conversations would flow without pause, and the hours would fly by without notice. Every time, I thought, “This could be something special.” And every time, just as I started to let my guard down, just as they are declaring how much they are falling for me (sometimes even the next day), I got the same message: they’re feeling too much, falling too hard; they're intimidated by me, or overwhelmed by how amazing they think I am. They weren’t prepared for those feelings, and ran for the hills (thankfully with a parting message, at least).

A female friend of mine told me, “You can be a little intimidating. It’s like, why is the seemingly almost perfect guy on Reddit?” And maybe that’s part of the problem. I turned to Reddit to meet someone special, and I found the place for me, like-minded people, the place I always should have been on. Because the usual dating apps never seemed to work for me. I get matches by the dozen, but it's poignantly superficial. All the filters in the world can't narrow down the pool to  the kind of deep, authentic connections with curious, interesting, maybe slightly nerdy or goofy but downright adorable people I’m looking for. Apps, with their focus on physical looks first, then light chitchat before a quick coffee date - it doesn't do it for me, and the kind of person who wants that isn't right for me. I adore getting to know someone slowly, through meaningful conversations, beyond surface-level small-talk. That's the way I feel I can truly connect. Like anyone else on Reddit, I’m just trying to navigate life and dating, albeit with my own quirks, experiences, and maybe different looks. Often on here, when I share photos people think I'm catfish, but once that trust is established the connection is like nothing else. The last one even tested me, by giving me a fake unappealing description of herself to see how I'd react, only giving me her photo and number once I responded to that gallantly and respectfully.

I find myself back in the dating pool in my 30s, with serious relationships behind me, so there’s a lot to juggle: responsibilities, a mortgage tying me down for the medium term, a diminishing circle of friends who are available regularly to head out and meet people. And maybe that's also intimidating to some women, paradoxically something they feel they want in a man but don't deserve. Yet it’s a new phase of life where I’m still figuring things out, just like anyone else. And all I really want is to find that click with someone who unlocks my charm, someone who makes everything else fade into the background for a moment.

I get it. If someone struggles with self-worth, attention from a guy who seems “almost perfect” on paper might set off alarm bells. Why is he interested in me? What’s he really after? How long until he’s bored? And those are fair questions. We all need caution with strangers until trust is built, and online makes that more crucial. But that presumption reduces me to an idealised, one-dimensional image, not a person with my own flaws, feelings, and uncertainties. Like them, I’m just trying to figure out life, and share that journey with someone who completes me.

 I know I’m worth more than just flirty messages or surface-level charm. I have so much affection, support, growth to share. But when a Reddit connection deepens and real feelings start to form, it seems that’s exactly when the walls go up. And at some point it makes me feel like for some women I'm great for ogling and fantasising about, enjoying flirting and passion, but too intimidating for something real.

I understand these sudden cut-offs say more about their insecurities - need for validation, abandonment issues, fear of commitment - than it does about me. Rationally, I know that. But each time, it inevitably chips away at me a little more. One person’s lack of self-worth can grind down another’s over time. I can’t help but wonder: after spending years caring for myself - my mind, my physical and mental health, my style, cmy career,my self-worth - maybe it would it be easier I weren’t so much of a “temptation”? Would women connect with me better if I ticked fewer boxes? If I presented myself as  less... put together? What even is the rationale for that? I can only be true to myself, and be me; anything else seems manipulation.

I’m not looking for perfection. I’m looking for someone real, someone who wants to build something meaningful together. Someone whose flaws aren't flaws to me, but adorable markers of her uniqueness,and reminders of everything I find amazing about her.

So how do you keep going when ticking all the right boxes, or being “too perfect”, makes seemingly amazing connections flame out, makes wonderful people feel insecure and run? How do you approach working on that together and overcoming it as a team, when they will listen to their flight instinct on an impulse? How d o you stay hopeful that the next connection will be different? How do you keep your morale up and your heart open, without naively repeating the pattern; while keeping enough guard on your heart that you stay true to yourself; yet open enough that you dont lock out the right person when they come along?

I've been in Vegas for almost a decade, and my friend count is still stuck at a big fat zero (unless you count my dog, who's a great listener but terrible at holding a conversation).  I'm a 48/m, work in education, and my hobbies include hiking, camping, and I still learning to cling desperately to the side of a rock while attempting to climb it.  Oh, and I'm a single dad who spends most of his free time being a stage parent/personal Uber driver for my kid's theater, singing, and swimming endeavors.

I've tried everything to meet people – apps, meetups, even joined a church for a while (turns out, even the Almighty can't help me with my friend-making skills).  I'm starting to think it's my face. I've been told I resemble a strip club bouncer who moonlights as a professional wrestler.  Apparently, ""approachable"" isn't exactly the first impression many get when they first meet me.

Vegas is a weird place. Everyone seems to be passing through, which makes it challenging to form lasting bonds (kind of like my recent romantic relationships or my love/hate relationship with houseplants).  Plus, let's be real, this city is built on partying and gambling.  Not exactly ideal for someone who prefers a good book and a hike at Red Rock. 

And don't even get me started on the lack of ""third places"" here.  I miss those cozy coffee shops and bookstores where you can actually strike up a conversation without someone trying to recruit you into the MLM scheme. At least my local Starbucks makes me feel welcome, but only because my son worked there while he was in college. 

So, fellow Vegas residents, am I alone in this desert of loneliness?  Anyone else struggling to find their tribe?

**Patriarchal Blessing for a Strong, Independent Woman Who Has Left the Mormon Church**

**Beloved daughter of a very confused Heavenly Father,**

I stand in awe as I lay my hands upon your independent head, a head that surely has known much wisdom, and not just from the Word of Wisdom. You are a woman of strength, fierce with the power of Netflix subscriptions, multiple cups of coffee, and the occasional spicy meme. 

You have courageously stepped away from the rigid rules, the starched shirts, and the endless casseroles. And in doing so, you have become a beacon of *sassy* righteousness in a world too often overwhelmed by small-town gossip and endlessly repetitive talks about ""faithful tithing."" My daughter, you are destined to rise above it all. I see you. You’re the person who knows when the casserole is dry, when the Sunday School lesson is *way* too long, and when the Relief Society President is low-key gossiping during the potluck. And I say, *thank you*, because the world needs more women like you. 

You are not just a woman of virtue; you are a woman of mystery, like a puzzling Instagram caption with 18 hashtags that no one fully understands but they all try to decipher. Know that your spiritual power lies not in your ability to bake a pie or wear a modest skirt (although I commend you for being able to rock *both* effortlessly)—but in your ability to say ""No, I will not participate in this ridiculousness"" and go on with your life. 

I bless you to find true joy in whatever you choose—whether it be yoga, dating someone who’s *actually* emotionally available, or creating a TikTok video that goes viral for reasons no one can explain. You are meant for greatness, and that greatness does *not* involve sitting through another interminable 3-hour church meeting where no one acknowledges your true genius as an entrepreneur of your own life.

You will be known for your sharp wit and your unparalleled skill in making the perfect guacamole (without any help from the Elders). The Spirit will whisper to you in the form of your own intuition, guiding you toward those necessary purchases on Amazon Prime, helping you to avoid toxic friendships, and even showing you where to find the best brunch spots that have mimosas. Remember, daughter, that your spirit is too big to be contained by any set of rules, even if they come with a “Modesty is Sexy” poster and a free copy of *The Family: A Proclamation to the World.*

Your strength, courage, and unyielding wit will serve as a beacon to other women who, like you, have begun to question why they’ve been spiritually *supervised* for far too long. I see you laughing at the absurdity of it all, knowing that your journey is *yours*—and no one else’s. So go ahead, build that empire, travel the world, flirt with the tech geek who’s way too cute for his own good, and above all, wear that bright red lipstick that’s got just the right amount of sass.

I bless you to never lose sight of your worth, which is not determined by whether or not you are married, or if you’ve ever sat through a sacrament meeting without wanting to start a riot. You are worthy of every single good thing that comes your way—except for people who tell you that you should come back to church. You don’t need that energy in your life. No, thank you.

So, go forth, my beloved daughter. Continue to shine, laugh, and unapologetically take up space. You are not only a child of God, you are a fabulous *force of nature* who will always remember that the only true “Eternal Family” is one that includes your favorite people, your own damn rules, and an endless supply of really good coffee. 

With much love, sarcasm, and a hearty fist-bump from the Universe,

* **Potential Dispensary Acquisition**: CBDL has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) for a strategic partnership involving a cannabis dispensary, opening doors to a new revenue stream and positioning the company as a frontrunner in the retail cannabis market. This move demonstrates CBDL's commitment to seizing high-value opportunities and expanding its influence in the cannabis sector.
* **Strategic Product Launches**: CBDL's product development pipeline has been a critical driver of growth. Flagship products like the Delta-8 Gummies, Pain Relief Cream, *Mellow Mornings* Nano CBD Coffee Creamer and the veterinarian-designed CBD Horse Paste have captured the attention of consumers and retailers alike, setting new benchmarks for product efficacy and quality.
* **Retail Expansion**: The company's bold move into Walmart Marketplace has significantly expanded its domestic footprint, while plans to launch on Alibaba pave the way for international growth. These initiatives align with CBDL's mission to make its top-tier products accessible to a global audience.
* **Innovative Science and Technology**: CBDL's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology, such as nanotechnology, ensures that its products deliver maximum bioavailability and effectiveness. The development of mushroom-based supplements targeting stress reduction and cognitive health showcases the company's ability to diversify its portfolio in response to emerging consumer trends.
* **Operational Excellence**: By streamlining its supply chain and optimizing production processes, CBDL has not only scaled operations but also improved profit margins, ensuring sustainable growth.

**Leadership Perspective**

Lisa Nelson, President and CEO of CBD Life Sciences, Inc., remarked, ""Our 622% revenue growth from June to November is not just a number; it's a reflection of the trust our customers and partners place in us. This achievement is a direct result of our team's unwavering commitment to excellence.

The market's rapid expansion offers a unique opportunity for investors to capitalize on what is poised to become one of the most lucrative industries in the health and wellness space.

1h78sm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoneyOnlinefree/comments/1h78sm3/prime_opinion_opinions/,"""Prime opinion"" opinions...","Prime Opinion offers an easy and enjoyable way to make money online. The main goal of the app is to **collect points by taking surveys and then convert those points into cash.** Plus, you can increase your earnings with some extra features and bonuses. Let’s dive into how Prime Opinion works and explore its advantages together! PS. Today, I am close to complete 50 dollars check. I worked for it nearly for one month, but it may be different for you. I don’t have too much time to fill surveys.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Earn Money by Taking Surveys

All you need to do on Prime Opinion is fill out the surveys provided. **You earn a certain number of points for each survey, and as your points accumulate, you can reach your rewards faster.** The surveys are usually short and simple, meaning you can earn money while sipping your coffee! ☕💸

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Earn by Playing Games: Sometimes Easy, Sometimes Challenging 🤨

Prime Opinion isn’t just limited to surveys. You can **earn points by playing some games as well.** However, the rewards here can be a bit inconsistent. For example, while the reward system in some games is reasonable, others make it extremely difficult to win big prizes. But if you’re a fan of those games, who am I to judge? If you manage to find games that truly pay off, you can definitely **kill two birds with one stone!** 🎮🕹️

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Complete Surveys for 7 Days and Enter a 1,000-Point Raffle! 🎁

Prime Opinion rewards your active participation. **If you fill out at least one survey every day for seven consecutive days, you get a chance to win up to 1,000 points in a raffle.** You pick one of the 24 boxes to try your luck. So far, I’ve managed to win a maximum of 500 points ($5) from these raffles. **500 points isn’t bad—it’s enough to cover my coffee expenses!** ☕💸 I try to keep up with the weekly streak to participate in the raffle every seven days.

 \-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Level System: Extra Benefits as You Level Up 📈

The app features a **level system,** where you earn extra points and unlock new features every time you level up. **It’s possible to earn more with new features,** so leveling up really does help. In a way, this adds a bit of an RPG (role-playing game) vibe to the whole experience. Who knows, maybe one day I’ll reach level 99 and earn the title of ""Survey King."" 👑😂

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use My Link and Get a +10% Bonus for the First 24 Hours! 🎉

If you **sign up for Prime Opinion using my referral link,** you’ll get a +10% point bonus for surveys completed within the first 24 hours. **This means you can rack up points faster without missing out on opportunities.** Both you and I benefit—welcome to the winners' club! 🎉

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Leaderboard System: ""More Surveys, More Points,"" But Not Easy 😅

There’s also a **leaderboard system** on Prime Opinion, but earning points from it requires serious effort. **I haven’t earned anything from the leaderboard so far,** since it demands filling out a massive number of surveys. I guess becoming a ""survey warrior"" will take a bit more time. But who knows, maybe one day I’ll conquer the entire leaderboard! 🏆😂

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Earned Points 💳

With the points you earn from Prime Opinion, you can create virtual credit cards. The best part is that **you can customize these cards with any name you want.** Use it for yourself or create a card as a gift for a friend. I was disappointed to find that it didn’t work on a local shopping site, but it worked flawlessly on Amazon. **So basically, you can say ""I'm earning my own money"" while shopping on Amazon.** It’s not exactly being a modern-day Robin Hood, but hey, close enough! 📦🎁

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prime Opinion is a great option for those who want to make some extra money by making the most of small time slots. **Whether you're waiting somewhere or traveling by public transport, you have the chance to earn a little extra cash.** As the saying goes, ""Little drops make the mighty ocean."" I invite you all to start earning. This app can make a big difference with small efforts. **Come on, let’s earn together!**",1,1733404145.0,MakeMoneyOnlinefree,1,1.0,False

She is currently a part time barista and spends all her free time smoking weed. 

10 years ago, when we first started dating, she worked two service jobs to support us while I was in college. Once I graduated, I immediately found a full time job and have stayed in that career ever since. 

Eventually she became tired of full time service work so she decided to go to back to school and I agreed to financially support us in that time. The plan was for her to finish her degree in 2 years, get a full time job in her field, and then we could save enough money to move. But that didn’t happen. 

She kept dropping classes, started smoking more and more weed, couldn’t manage her time. 4 years passed, and she was only 1 semester away from graduating but she couldn’t finish because of her inability to stay organized and focused. The schoolwork overwhelmed her and her main coping mechanisms are to avoid and get high. 

Since it is clear that she is not going to finish school, I have asked her repeatedly over the last year to get a full time job. It’s been 4 years and I am tired of having no money for myself, and constantly having to go into debt to afford our expenses. For example, she had a root canal last year that cost $1,500. I had to put it on a credit card and I still havent paid it off.

She has a part time job as a barista at a local coffee shop making $16 /hr plus tips. It’s 25 hours a week. In my opinion, it’s not nearly enough to adequately help support us but she LOVES the job. It’s fun and laid back. All her coworkers are super chill 22 year olds and they listen to music all day and have fun making drinks. Of course she loves it. Who wouldn’t? But I keep telling her that it’s not enough money and that I want her to find a full time job with a better salary. She refuses and says that she wants to become a manager at the coffee shop instead. But the thing is that the manager position is only a $1 raise and 30 hrs a week. It’s really not much more money. And who knows when a manager position will be open? And if they’ll wanna give it to her? 
But she refuses to budge. Meanwhile, all of the financial burden falls on me and she is totally okay with that. So long as she gets to have fun at work and then come home and smoke a bunch of weed, nothing else really matters to her I guess. 

I’m so angry with this situation, it wasn’t the plan when we got married. It was supposed to be 50/50. Now I feel like I’m condemned to forever struggling financially to support us or divorcing and then I’d have to pay her alimony probably because she refuses to find better work. I feel like I am the only adult in the marriage and that I’m married to a selfish person.

Am I the asshole for wanting her to quit the job that she loves and find a better one so that we can be more financially secure? ",5,1733403893.0,AmItheAsshole,29,0.73,False

1h78ler,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1h78ler/grind_adjustment/,Grind adjustment ,"Just got my machine and so far I’m liking it. However, when doing a double shot, my machine has been recommending grind size 10. This morning my shot seemed fast and the shot volume was only half of what it should have been. It sounded like the machine dumped the other half into the drip tray. It recommended grind 7. Pulled another on grind 7 and it was a longer pull and seemed to give the normal shot amount. But the recommendation went back up to 10. 

For reference I do use WDT to even out the grind and hopefully get more consistency. Using lavazza beans until my freshly roasted beans come in. My wife also used the drip coffee function the day before and it was on grind setting 25, so I am wondering if making that big of a jump in grind settings may have made a difference. 

Can anyone help me narrow down what may have happened? Also, does anyone know how to make the beeping sound quieter? The alert is great but gosh that volume is abrasive first thing in the morning. ",1,1733403520.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False

I (28M) think my(25F) girlfriend is cheating on me. We started dating at the beginning of last year and were together for most of it. The second half of our relationship was exclusive, but there were issues and she often seemed distant and not very affectionate.
There were a few times when she admitted to flirting and talking to other people. Whenever I brought it up, she’d either change the subject or brush it off, saying it was just harmless fun. She also had hangouts with male friends alone, sometimes at odd hours of the night and would delete the chats from her“friends.” She even admitted to emotionally cheating, both in person and through messages, saying she liked the attention and validation from other men.
We had many conversations about it, and she promised it would stop, but eventually, she pulled away and broke up with me. She gave a different reason for the breakup, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that the other issues played a role.

Almost a year later she reached out, apologized for everything, and admitted that the “friends” weren’t as innocent as she made them out to be. We talked about getting back together and agreed on a committed, communicative relationship with just the two of us. Things seemed great, and we discussed how we’d handle things better this time.
She had to leave town for a few months for work and the commute was too hard to keep up with so we continued while she was gone via text and call, and when she came back , things were good for a few weeks. she received a message from an old male friend out of nowhere from a person she claimed she didn't have any real communicating with and he randomly messaged her and asked her, and she planned to go with him for some tea and coffee . When I asked about who he was, she shut it down immediately and defensively told me she won't be argueing and said this is what is happening and didn't refused to let me speak my feels because she didn't care and it's a me problem . . She said she wasn’t asking for permission, got frustrated, and told me I was overreacting and controlling. She also made comments about how I should just trust her and shouldn’t question her actions. Mentioned she doesn't care what I do, It felt like things flipped back to the way they were before, where I didn’t matter and not actually loved
I really don’t want to be controlling, but after everything we’ve been through, I can’t help but feel uneasy. She insists it’s just a harmless meetup, but I’m worried that history is repeating itself. I don’t want to overthink or ruin what we’ve rebuilt, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is off.

Advice wanted ,"My best friend Kayla passed away in March of 2022, and this was our favorite book series to read together and talk about. We read every book together on release, theorized, and had a blast. It was an amazing way to experience the series. I even read her all of Rhythm of War over the course of almost a year over 15 minute phone calls when she was in jail. 

I was gearing up for a reread when she died, and I haven’t been able to read anything, not even a single Cosmere book, since. 

With Wind and Truth coming out, I desperately want to reread the series and read the new book. I’ve been trying to reread it all year. But… when I pick up Way of Kings and go to open to the first page, my grief comes flooding back. It’s not the same without her. I can’t share it with her again, and no one else in my life cares about these books. And even if they did, it wouldn’t be the same. As of this morning I have pulled the books out of storage and set them on my coffee table out in the open, and that is the most progress I have been able to make towards reading them since January. 

This morning I also finally, finally, was able to preorder Wind and Truth. But reading it? Reading any of them? It feels like an impossible task. 

I am in therapy, and I can talk about this there. But I was wondering if there was anyone else in a similar situation? Who lost a loved one between books and struggled too? 

If so, what helped you read the books again? Did it make you really really sad? Did it get easier?

1h78e11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1h78e11/went_overseas_to_date_women_kind_of_stunned_really/,Went overseas to date women... kind of stunned really.,"Typical story long term marriage divorce with kids, shared custody. And dating... in the western world egads is it bad right?

Been divorced a few years. Right after the divorce was final I went to a country where I spoke the language and had a fun few days. It seemed easy to date women in that location but I was not looking for a relationship so I didn't keep in touch.

And I have had some success dating here in the west. I have dated like 30+ women, had 3, two month+ relationships and 1 year plus relationship.

It's not the lack of dating that makes dating in the first world west so insufferable. It's really the EFFORT it takes to date here in the west. I mean plenty of dates were predicated on me doing ALL the work to make a date or outing happen. All the little princesses had to do is show up.

So after my 1 year relationship ended, I decided to go farther overseas and see what it was like. planned for a multi-week visit to a country I have visited for business but not for vacation. I would live in a major city, hang out and see if dating elsewhere would be better.

The first thing that stunned me was the matches on dating apps - I mean in my area in the US I would be lucky to get a match 1 in 100 swipes. But overseas? it was like 1 in 5 or better. And these women responded actively none of the half heart-ed ""hbu"" ""what u do"" replies oh no these ladies wanted to actively communicate. 

The second thing was the aggressive proactive attempts at meeting. This happened multiple times but I would casually say ""Yeah I'm going to Mall X and having a coffee"", Lady reply - ""oh I love that mall and coffee place Y want to meet there?"", not only were the ladies showing high interest, but they were also actively going out of their way to come to me!

The third thing that was drastically different was the dates themselves. I can't remember the last time I had a date when the woman would not explicitly tell me what she wanted in a potential relationship. It could be a ""how much you make? what car you drive?"", ""my love language is Paper Benjamin's"" or ""I think that it's important for you to be a Communist like me"" or whatever... but the number of hoops and trick questions I dealt with in western dating was a pain. Overseas? no political questions. no subtle questions about wealth. (odd right?) Granted I'm very sus of motives in dating but when a woman actually asks questions to find out personality and common interests... It is very compelling. 

There are other things I noticed, and other things I loved about this particular area overseas. I had heard from people who visited claiming ""if you go you won't want to come home""... I laughed at the time. But wouldn't you know it I am planning on going back very very soon.

And yes I have a new infatuation. I have no idea if this will go on long term but after a very attractive woman asks YOU out 3 times, and pays 2 of those times... you tend to think she's very interested. 

Probably not going to bother with western dating in the future. I have experienced better.",16,1733402835.0,Divorce_Men,10,0.87,False
1h78dsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/YetiCoolers/comments/1h78dsu/hotshot_cap_and_car_cupholder_compatible/,Hotshot cap and car cupholder compatible. ,"Hi. Apologies, I suspect this is quite a common question... we have got loads of Yeti products. We are fans of them because of their great quality, industial looks,and their ability to keep stuff warm for so long. One of my favourite things from yeti is their hotshot lid, which I think is probably the best solution on the market for hot drinks on the go. 

Unfortunately, our new car has relatively small cupholders. None of our yeti bottles and tumblers fit. I'm thinking of getting the 10 ounce tumbler as it will fit, and that's more than enough black coffee in one go (how the hell people drink half a litre or more of coffee in one go I will never know...). However it has a magnetic lid which I'm not massively keen on, I think probably one of the worst lids on the market. They look like how even just a bump in the car can make splash up through them, and I find them strangely unpleasant to drink from. I just don't think the hole is quite right. 

Do yeti have anything with the same profile at the bottom, that will go in cupholders, and is compatible with a hotshot lid that isn't more than about 12 ounces?

If not, any plans for Yeti to make one, as it seems to be quite common request?

I would like to stay with Yeti, but as last report, are there any other brands worth looking at that might suit my needs?

**Chapter 1**

**Dominos**

The incident was meant to be the perfect ending to his night but became the ultimate beginning of his new story.

In truth, the beginning of his story is rarely told.

The event itself marked the close of one chapter and the unmistakable start of another. For Don, it felt like an analogy for his entire existence—everything leading inexorably to this moment.

The wreckage of Don’s past stuck to him like swamp rot, the stink of something long buried but never dead. There was talk—always talk—about those years on the plantations, the days of bare-knuckle sermons and half-mad patrols through fields lit by nothing but a vulture moon. Whatever happened back then stayed stitched into the fabric of his stride, a low-frequency tremor that made the animals shy and the smarter folks cross the street.

A week earlier, Don Nickson, the man that would soon be known in the neighbourhood as the Preacher, ordered a coffin, handmade for three.  Model, “Belly in the Breast”, a pleasant turn of speak. A compartment for a child, the parents to cradle their little-one into their trip under the earth.

It took 8 days to complete the construction.

""Enough room,"" the carpenter explained, ""for two adults and a toddler to pass through together,” I was given to understand. The design was somber yet practical—a mother and father cradling their child for eternity. A final family tableau to sink into the mud.

After tucking his dead wife in for what he told himself was an eternal, peaceful sleep, Don set out. He drove aimlessly toward the city. A town like this, he fretted, wasn’t supposed to succumb to lawlessness. But that night felt like hell unleashed.   Earlier, he'd made a clumsy pass at his wife.  When she refused him, he bit her cheek—not for the first time.  The bite would remain with her for the rest of her short time on the surface.

The young wife brushed it off, as always, murmuring for him to go to bed.  

By midnight, Don was driving past the cornershop, flames licking its eaves, the fire spilling toward the houses beyond. The air was thick, suffocating—muggy with the heat of a summer night where even shadows seemed alive and burning. Smelting like ore, sticky, The Paso was a city on fire, people were losing their minds. It was a heat wave, hell on earth. Bodies piled up like fallen stumps - the underbelly of The Paso's tree-lined avenues.

Don sneered at the memory of his newly-wed wife. Marianne, that was her name. Mari. *It had been hard to maintain a relationship on such little trust.* Don would often say Mari had been a dead-beat long before he ever laid eyes on her.

“Damn fruitcake”.

He kept driving, trying to calm his nerves. Dominoes in the district. That’s what people did on nights like this—Irish coffee, dominoes, and the comfortable rituals of a bygone era. After all, hadn’t the evening already taken enough from him? This should be, Don imagined the click of tiles on table, a beautiful mechanism that would calm the nervous system after such a bloody evening.

That afternoon, Mari sat as still as a corpse, but her presence bled into every corner of the kitchen. She wasn’t *there*—not in the way people were supposed to be there. The silence between them was thick, sticky, the kind that made the skin crawl. 

""Who the hell gets married in these parts anymore?"" Don muttered, his voice a low growl. The old-timers and the neighborhood gossips had always gathered in threes and fours, whispering when he was still a bachelor, and later, when they said he ""shouldn't have married her, not his type."" They’d spit out their words and shoo away the flies.

He clamped his hand on his neck as night-time flashed, exploded and burnt across his face through the windows of his cabriolet. The heat of the city crashed against him like a volatile storm settling down—still burning. *The heat’s turning,* Don thought. *Nightfall will settle it.* He nodded, but the nod was more for himself.

Children shot off into the night of the blacked-out streets, into alleys. Their hands scraped raw against the damp brick walls, leaving trails of slick black marks as they pressed forward.  They scattered into the lanes like *goddamn nuclear cockroaches*, fading into the shadows. Crawling toward some unseen doom that waited in the dark.Soon after his marriage to Marianne, Don started to fall into a mood of detachment, Mari had called it an “absence”, but it was more than that. It was as if his presence had begun to leak out.  When the incident occurred, it started out innocently enough but snowballed into a dark secret even by Don's standards.  

""Dominoes, clear the mind,"" Don thought as he drove into the district. Its streets twisted, hungry, pulling everything toward their shadowed core. Watching. Judging.

Electric fences cut through the alleys, walls built to keep the unworthy out and the undesirables locked in. This was where Don belonged—where there was no judgment. The forgotten backstreets, barely lit, hidden beyond those, the depths of La Fiesta Sórdida. The deeper he drove, the more the night bubbled to life. His mind climbed the rooftops, but the wind blew him off. It was a treacherous town where even the buildings seemed to lean in, listening. The alleys pulsed, neon flickered. He’d heard the stories - ‘La Fiesta Sordida'.  A carnival of an endless evening. 

*Dominoes. Clear the mind,* Don mused again, his single-track mind covering his earlier missteps that evening as he turned off the main boulevard into the chaos of the Mudneck burrough sprawled out like canvas, each thread pulling tighter with every mile. *Let he be judged,* Pat mulled.

On the building above, a man was screaming in volts. His fist smacking the walls. He danced a dark agony. Warning, pleading. ""Please, my daughter, she's lost in those streets. My baby, she is lost in that street somewhere. Please. She's not herself, she's lost control""

A rock hit metal, dull thud. A crash. The balconies were crowded, bodies flashing in and out of view, dancing. The man slumped, sliding down the metal railing to the ground, a crumpled figure. “Stay away from La Carnivale,” someone muttered.

Bodies littered the streets—tossed by the wind, crushed under car tires. Casualties of La Sórdida.

Don glanced around. The real work of the dead was being done here.

The district was in full swing. Death was in the air.

""You shouldn’t have married her,"" murmured voices echoed around him. *Goddamn Mutterers*.

The streets buzzed with noise—music, sex, the smell of rotting flesh. The smell of sin. The smell of dying souls. A smell that would last for the years to come. 

In the dark, Don saw the blur of domino tables lining the cul-de-sac. Faces lit by red coals: grey, ash-white. He liked the burn of the coal smoke, thick and oily, it cindered rich and heavy. He parked his car and stepped out. The engine gurgled, lurched angular, hicupped then fell silent. The breeze tugged at his clothes.

He moved between the tables, amongst street-players, tiles clicking, like teeth on marble. The men at the tables, big-headed, laughing, talking over their hands.

“To the meat grinder!” they cursed.

“To the meat grinder!” They laughed again, louder this time.He paused a moment, studying the scene. A man, cigarillo dangling from the corner of his mouth, clinked his teeth against his cup as he stared blankly at the tiles laid out before him. Deliberating. Faux. Each player was tethered to the game, eyes fixed, hands steady, a black-soaked cloth wrapped around their fingers, tobacco cubes scattered like dark, dried remnants of something forgotten. Smoke curled from their lips, the air thick with the smell of burnt leaves, as if each exhale was part of some ancient ritual.

Back when Pat was a child, they’d gathered in dimly lit rooms across from the church, the walls soaked in incense and shadow. But now, in these times of sin, the tables sprawled out on the streets.

His gaze lifted to the townhouse looming above the street—The Pachyderm. A game was unfolding on the shingled roof, a strange little world of its own.

Don’s usual spot was at a table on the veranda of the Pachyderm, above the laneway but below the higher stakes games playing out on the roofline above.

""A man needs a pastime, even if it is a sin,"" one of the men said as Don squatted into his regular seat, his voice rough, like it had been carved out of stone, and phlegm.

""Amen to that,"" Don replied, his smile thin, shadowed.

""Your interest, sir?"" came the question, eyes narrowing in quiet expectation.

""A drink!"" Don barked. ""A tot and a smoke will do.""

Some faces around the table were familiar, remnants of old battles, mostly none of them recognized him. Then again, they never had. *New faces tonight, bloated ugly faces* Don thought.“This game is an answer to a man who don’t wanna be alone,"" Don had once confessed, voice low, almost conspiratorial.

**Mescaline Tea.**

The man beside him had been a soldier—joined the military straight out of high school, just to pay off his student loans. A year in, and he'd limped out with bad knees, shaky feet, and a pair of leather shoes that didn’t quite fit anymore.

He looked down at his shoes, the steel legs jutting out beneath him. The street he lived on now was just one long bone-breaking walkway. ""Dirty business!"" he’d yell at a shopkeeper on occasion, trying to mimic the wisdom of his father. But it came out wrong, a crooked smile flashing as he waved his hand, signaling nothing.

Don’s mind wandered, the streetlights blurring as he settled back into the haze of the moment. No one asked about the blood on his clothes—not here, not in this town. Hell, it wasn’t any of their damn business.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Merchant**

Through-out the night La Sordida beckoned, pulling at Don’s gut like a mix of terror and hunger.

Tonight, he would enter the heart of it—La Fiesta Sórdida, the carnival of the damned. They said once you stepped into the laneways behind the townhouses, you were swallowed by it. The vibrance, the chaos—the lights bouncing off rooftops, the music twisting into screams, blending with the pulse of the night. It was madness, a living thing that devoured those who dared to wander.

Don coaxed his tile and looked over to The Final Fence, a name the locals gave to the tall, rowdy townhouses that formed the last barrier between him and the madness of La Sordida. It formed a crooked ring but a perfect border around the medina of La Sordida. Not that it needed any protection—civilians didn’t enter this place. And if they did, it was to vanish.

The first sign of life came as the music slithered out from a crack in the brick, scraping at the air like fingernails clawing at a scab on the arm.

“Hello, Donny boy,” the man oozed, his voice as slick as the sheen on his too-tight shirt. His smile was a crescent of bad teeth, too wide, too eager. Nobody trusted him—not the domino players, not the ghosts hanging in the corners. Especially not the whores.

“Mary had a boy, Donny... sing out: The boys of the parish,” he erupted, sliding a chipped glass of liquor and tea across the table.

The tea smelled sharp, medicinal, like it had been cooked up in a backroom by hands just as oily as his. Something about him crawled under Don’s skin, a wrongness that lingered long after he left.

Goddamn Thumbsuckers.

**Mari and the Flamenco Greaser**

""You know you're to be careful, 'La Belle Sauvage',"" her lover had warned her that afternoon.

""Oh yes... we all have to be careful,"" she replied, her voice smooth as silk, but brittle under the weight of something unspoken. She set the bed-tray down with a soft clink, pushing the wine glass to one side, her fingers tracing the curve of the glass before drawing away to rest at her side.

A coffee-stained glass by the bed, a thin film of soot clung to the rim, marking the passage of time—burnt edges of conversations that never quite finished, still lingering in the room's stale air. The air itself felt thick, almost pregnant with the weight of what had been, and what was coming

Now, as she sat on the curb outside the Diner—her prison, his refuge—waitimg, as did the streets, slick with secrets, carrying whispers of the things they had both tried to bury. Her eyes never leaving the car slowly creeping toward the restaurant.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Coffee and Cabs**

""I'll have to go get a coffee before the film,"" Don told his wife earlier that evening. It wasn't until they were both in the car that Marianne first noticed the change in her husband.

""It's too hot for coffee"" Marianne said. 

""Just the same"" Don replied, lowering the glass window and the cool air of the night brushed the skin on the back of his neck. It felt like the first breath of life in hours, but it did nothing to ease the restlessness gnawing at him.

He guided the cabriolet into the curb a few spaces from The Diner. The usual routine.

Marriane hung back.

""Coffee please, long black with a dash of cold milk, takeaway"" Don said to the server, his voice clipped. The waiter nodded, but the acrid scent of burning plastic crept in from somewhere distant, adding a layer of discomfort to the air.

""Are you alright?"" A passerby asked him. 

""I'm alright"" Don said. his words distant, eyes narrowing as they scanned the crowd. The city, always bustling, seemed empty now, drained, as if it had been hollowed out overnight. Don felt over-cooked. He looked down at his hand, the blood was starting to trickle again, almost dancing. Why was the blood doing this? He thought to himself. Flamenco blood.

""Ain't that your girl by that car out there, Don?"" the waiter asked casually, as he handed Don his coffee. His finger pointed to the cab Mari stood beside.

""Don't wanna stir no trouble, but that sure ain't lookin’ like your ride she sittin' by,"" he added, his voice laced with too much curiosity.

He let the silence stretch between them like a taut wire, and Marianne, watching from beside the cab, suddenly felt the chill of something unspoken between them. The stain on his shirt, now darkened with time, seemed almost to pulse with new life as Mari’s face drained of color. She stared at him, truly seeing him for the first time in years.

And then it hit her—the shift in his eyes, the implication of what was behind that strange, empty gaze. She closed her eyes in answer, as though she could shut it out with a blink, but it didn't work.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The bartender called the police around 8pm that evening.**

""She's about 5'7, wearing this baby blue babydoll dress,"" he said, his voice hoarse but also whiny. ""Real bouncy, and dancin’, yellin’an’hola-an’ like her life depended on it,""  

He paused, leaning closer to the phone, the hiss of static filling the space between his words.

“She looked ""like somebody had whipped her with a hose.  Started getting undressed right there in the middle of the place before that fella done-yankin’ ‘er outta hee.” a regular added.

""Damn Hal,” another interjected “She looked like she'd been dragged through the bubbling mud’o hell. The voice on the other end asked for clarification, and he exhaled, smoke curling around his head like a halo of regret.

""Knocked an old lady clean down the street in her tantrum,"" he muttered. ""Never seen nothing like it.""

When the officers arriver, the bartender’s account was vivid, though riddled with the embellishments of a man who’d seen one too many wild nights. “She was like a firecracker, all over the place,” he told the officers as they scrawled notes under the dim fluorescent bar light. “Then she started yellin’ about somebody takin’ her shoes. Next thing I know, she’s tryin’ to strip right there at the bar. That guy—tall, dark hair—he pulled her out quick. Didn’t want no trouble.” The bartender paused, his voice lowering. “But then she just lost it. Like, completely. Screaming, throwing things—she knocked down poor Mrs. Cutter like she was a rag doll.”

**The Ride Before the Panic**

The car was a furnace of bad vibrations, heat trapped in the cracked upholstery, vinyl creaking with every turn of the wheels as if groaning in agony. The eldest boy sat in the back, silent, eyes locked on the shifting shadows outside the window. Mari slid into the passenger seat and froze. There was only one child. The absence of the youngest hit her like a butcher’s cleaver.

Her voice cracked like dry earth. “Where is he? Where’s—”

Don’s hands were gripped the wheel like talons. His knuckles bulged, pale against the leather. His jaw worked a piece of gum that wasn’t there, teeth grinding in mechanical silence. He said nothing, his face a mask of dull, unmoving fury, like some terrible automaton animated by pure spite.

He was a man unraveling, and he wanted company for the ride.

“Don.” Her voice sharpened, a scalpel slicing through the tension. “Where *is* he? What have you done?”

He didn’t answer, not at first. Instead, the car lunged forward, tires skittering over gravel, the engine a low growl as the headlights carved out slices of the dark road ahead. The silence between them was thick as tar, pooling in the cramped cabin.

“Don!” she screamed, a feral crack in her voice now, her fists slamming against the dashboard.

Finally, he spoke, each word slow, measured, dripping venom. “Do you know what happens to people who don’t listen, Mari? People who think they can leave when they like, take what they want, and walk away?”

She froze, her breath caught somewhere between her lungs and her throat. The stories flooded back, whispered tales of Don's time out on the lands, the unspeakable rumors that clung to him like bloodstains he never could wash away. She thought of the floating atolls, their grotesque beauty, the places where men disappeared and didn’t return. She thought of the **Meat Factory**, the stories that came out in shuddering fragments. It wasn’t a slaughterhouse; it was a machine of ruin, a place where bodies and minds were ground into nothing.

Her voice cracked. “You didn’t—”

He turned to her, and for a moment, his eyes caught the dim green glow of the dashboard, turning them into lifeless orbs. “You know what they take down there, don’t you? Fresh meat. I hear they pay well, though. Real well.”

Her hands flew to her mouth, a gasp escaping her that wasn’t entirely human. “You bastard,” she hissed, her voice shaking with rage and fear. “You’re lying. You wouldn’t—”

“Shut up,” he croaked. His voice was thin, paper-thin, like it might crumble into dust if he let it go any longer. ""Just shut up.""

But she didn’t. She didn’t shut up. Her voice rose like the scraping of metal on glass, an agonizing screech that felt as though it might tear through the fabric of the car itself. “Tell me you didn’t take him there. Tell me you didn’t—”

But she wasn’t sure. She couldn’t be sure. The silence was too complete, the threat hanging in the air like a sickly-sweet perfume. She whipped around to the boy in the back seat. “Where is your brother? Tell me!”

The boy didn’t move, didn’t speak. He stared at his knees, his small frame curled tight, as though bracing against some invisible storm.

“Answer her,” Don said flatly, his voice devoid of anything resembling warmth. “Go on. Tell your mother where your little brother is. Or don’t. Maybe you’d rather let her figure it out herself.”

Mari lunged for the steering wheel, but Don’s arm shot out, shoving her back against the seat with a force that knocked the wind from her lungs. “Sit down,” he barked.

“You’re a monster,” she spat, tears streaming down her face now, her fists pounding uselessly against his arm.

“No, Mari,” he said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “I’m *the monster* you made. And now, you’ll learn what that means.”

The car sped on into the dark, a vessel of fear and fury, careening away from their bungalow that promised no solace, only silence and the slow unraveling of whatever threads still held their lives together.His mind was crawling over itself, each thought sticky and wet, pulling him under.

He couldn’t remember when the road had turned into this, but it had. This was the end of the line, the end of everything—his life, her life, their son’s life—all caught in the tangled webs of twisted bargains and forgotten promises. He was driving them straight into the maw of the beast, into a place where even the air was wrong, thick with the odor of bodies crammed together, rotting from the inside out.

And as they pulled into the diner’s parking lot, the sirens started in the distance, an fore-warning of things to come in the morning.

**An Asylum in The Paso**

It was an asylum of sorts, this new life in the District.  He’d heard there were still mobs out-in towards the Plantations, hounding towards him.  The only roads still safe for him out there all pointed towards the meat factories. 

He’d often think back to that time, he knew what he did was wrong, but during the Conflict different rules apply to men-and-thieves alike.   By the time Don rolled into the new town, his two sons in tow—seven and twelve—they were strangers in a borrowed life. His wife had traded their quiet chaos for the glittering emptiness of a cabaret stage, leaving Don to reinvent himself. Enter the Goddamn Flamenco Flirt.

Don called himself *Jesus of the Podu in those days, during the Conflict,* promising salvation to anyone desperate enough to believe. Everyone was desperate in those times.“One day,” he’d say, eyes gleaming with fire and fatigue, “all men will wake up to the truth. And they won’t ask, ‘What should we do?’ but ‘What must we do?’” and pledging that one day, all men would wake up to the revolutionary promise.

Marianne had become a caricature in his memories—a plump, hollowed-out parody of the woman she once was. She existed now only in the glances of strangers who thought they saw something in Don’s eyes. Something fractured.  “The pitted face of a whore” he’d murmur like a tick during his Diner-tile sermons.  In the greasy kitchen of that rundown diner, his sermons laced with the fervor of a man teetering on the edge of revelation.  *If she’d lived, Don thought to himself,* she’d probably become a plump and impossibly perfect poster girl for God-mongerers.

**The Domino Effect**

The night had already stretched itself thin by the time Don finished his last round of dominoes. The familiar click of the tiles against the table, the dull murmur of voices, the smoke curling lazily in the air—it all felt distant now. He could hear it, though, even over the noise of the game. The low hum, the pulse of something *other*, something just beyond the rows of townhouses where the dominoes scattered. La Sordida. The name hung in his mind like a dirty secret, like a whispered invitation. He felt it pull him, a tug at the back of his skull, like the irresistible draw of a storm just before the rain.There was something waiting for him there. And maybe—just maybe—something he could take with him when he left.

He laid his dominoes down with a soft clack, his hand trembling slightly as he finished his turn. The game had lost its hold on him, the shapes and patterns of the pieces meaningless now. They were just objects, just things that clattered and fell. The night outside was far more important.The domino hit the table like a tooth cracking in a jaw. Don leaned back, fingers jittering over the rim of his chipped espresso cup. The others glared: old men with sticky hands, teeth like splintered piano keys, leaning forward as though the table itself might suddenly reveal his tell. Shady, they called him. Always too calm. Always winning like he’d seen the ending a hundred times over.

“Gotta piss,” Don muttered, chair scraping back.Don stood up slowly, his chair scraping across the floor. His legs felt strange as he moved, as if the patio had tilted slightly, or perhaps he had. He walked toward the steps, the voices trailing behind him but fading as the weight of La Sordida pressed harder against his chest. The laneway between the townhouses was dark, swallowed by shadows that reached out like fingers from the streetlights above. The pull was stronger now. It thrummed in his bones.

One of the players, a man with a scruffy beard and a heavy sigh, nudged another and whispered, “He’s going in, isn’t he?”

“Did, y’all see the blood on ee’s shirt?  Ee’s got himself intuh some troublin’ methinks.”

The other nodded, eyes wide, but Don didn’t bother to look up. They were all waiting for something. They always were. The air had shifted. It wasn’t just dominoes anymore.

The others at the table had stopped their game and were watching him now. Their eyes, heavy with the weight of their own boredom, flicked toward him, some with a knowing look, others with suspicion. A few murmured quietly, but Don didn’t care. The sound—the call—was too clear to ignore. It felt like the world was breathing in time with it, and he was the only one who could hear the beat.

Outside, the air peeled at his skin. He stumbled into the alley, past the vomit-streaked walls leading into **La Sordida**, the cantinas squatting in the dark on each side like a wolf about to leap. Something was off. A sour film on his tongue, stomach flipping like a fish on asphalt. His tea? No, it was deeper than that, a bad frequency humming just beneath the skin of the night.

Bottles smashed down the block, cascading in shrapnel glints. Overhead, a row of lights stuttered to life, harsh and surgical. Figures began pouring into the street, their movements jerky, skin pale as wax paper stretched over bone. Zombies—no, something worse, something organized, deliberate. Porch lights flickered on every second house, a domino line of false hope. The figures, like moths in bad suits, flocked to the glow. Then darkness. A mechanical click.

The swarm pivoted as one, silent as sharks. Don backed into the shadow of a derelict doorway, watching their heads bob as they scaled the sloping lawns. Then blackness swallowed the street. No light, no sound but the thin whine in Don’s ears.  He stumbled, pawed at a light-pole to keep himself upright.  His head thrummed.

He blinked, and the halogen streetlights snapped shut in a cold cascade. The air was dead, thick as wet velvet. A cab skidded to the curb, brake lights painting the scene arterial red. A whore, legs folding like origami cranes, slipped into the backseat. The cab pulled away, leaving Don alone.

An arm slipped into his, first his left, then his right.  Holding him up, spewing him forward.  Into the night, new camaraderie maybe, as he was consumed by the swarm, like football hooligans with a purpose.  The cache of the mob

He staggered past an ATM, blinking green and hungry. His fingers moved without command, card sliding in and out, cash bleeding into his hands, his pockets. Another street, another machine. Was it a game? A ritual? His wallet grew lighter, and the world heavier, an obscene carnival draped in neon guts and ash.Don’s breath was a shallow wheeze by the time they hit the third ATM. He couldn’t remember whose hand shoved the card in or whose fingers pressed the buttons, but the machine coughed up bills like a sick animal. The green glow burned his eyes. He tried to focus, to count, but the numbers wriggled like worms across the screen.

“That’s it, mate,” one of them said, a wiry man with a smile like broken glass. His accent shifted with every word, a carnival barker turning into a priest, then a judge. “Give it all up. You’re free now. Ain’t freedom grand?”

Don tried to pull away, but the other one—a squat figure with arms too long for his body—tightened his grip. “Where you off to, pal? Night’s young. Friends stick together, yeah?”

Friends. That word snagged in Don’s mind like a rusted nail. How had this started? He remembered the tea, bitter and strange, handed to him with a grin in the domino parlor. Then the handshakes, the pats on the back, the laughter that cracked like cheap porcelain. “New mates,” they’d said, “let’s show you around.”

But now their laughter was wrong. It wasn’t laughter at all; it was the sound of gears grinding in an engine about to blow.

The street twisted ahead, folding into itself like a drunk forgetting which way was home. The neon signs sputtered and died, leaving only the sickly sodium glow of a distant lamppost. The mob dragged him forward, their chatter a hive of overlapping voices.

“Next stop,” one of them said, his voice syrupy, too sweet. “Got a spot that’ll change your life, mate.”

They pulled him through the haze, past shuttered shops and alleyways that yawned like open graves. A woman in a sequined dress stumbled out of a bar, her face painted with streaks of mascara and sweat. She locked eyes with Don, her lips parting as if to speak, but one of his new “friends” barked out a laugh, and she disappeared into the shadows.

“Who are you?” Don slurred, his tongue thick and useless. His legs felt like they’d been switched with someone else’s, unsteady and foreign.

“We’re the only ones who’ll remember you tomorrow,” said the wiry man, his grin widening. “Isn’t that worth a little generosity?”

The fourth ATM blinked into view, a grotesque altar of steel and glass. Don tried to stop, but his body wasn’t his anymore. The squat man slid the card into the slot and turned to Don with a wink. “One more for the road, eh?”

Something in Don snapped. His arm jerked free, and he swung blindly. His fist connected with something solid—bone, cartilage, maybe both—and the wiry man staggered back, clutching his nose.

“Oi!” The squat man growled, his long arms snaking out to grab Don, but Don was moving now, adrenaline burning through the fog. He shoved the man away and stumbled into the street.

“Run, mate!” someone shouted. It wasn’t one of them. A voice from nowhere, or everywhere. He didn’t care. He ran.

Behind him, the mob swarmed, their footsteps a wave crashing closer. His heart pounded, his breath ragged, but the street stretched endlessly ahead. The lights flickered again, a cruel strobe that painted the world in slices. In one flash, he saw the squat man grinning. In another, the wiry man lunged. Then darkness swallowed them all.

Don didn’t feel the first blow, or the second. He only knew the ground was suddenly too close, and the world was tilting, spinning. The last thing he saw was the cracked face of the fifth ATM, its screen flashing **INSUFFICIENT FUNDS** before everything went black.

The Science Behind Hydration and Weight Loss
--------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated is crucial for your health, and it plays a significant role in weight loss. Water makes up about 60% of your body, and it is essential for many functions, including digestion, circulation, and regulating body temperature. When considering weight loss strategies, the role of hydration often gets overlooked, but understanding its science can boost your efforts.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Why Hydration Matters

Water is vital for multiple bodily functions. Here are some key reasons hydration is so important:

- **Supports Metabolism:** Drinking enough water can enhance your metabolic rate. Some studies suggest that drinking about 500 ml of water can increase metabolism by approximately 30% for about 30-40 minutes.
- **Aids Digestion:** Proper hydration helps your digestive system to function more smoothly. It can prevent constipation by softening stools and is essential for nutrient absorption.
- **Regulates Appetite:** Sometimes, your body confuses thirst with hunger. Drinking water before meals can help you feel fuller and reduce the number of calories you consume.
- **Improves Exercise Performance:** Staying hydrated can enhance physical performance. When you're dehydrated, your strength, endurance, and overall performance can suffer, making your workouts less effective for weight loss.

### How Water Affects Weight Loss

Understanding how water contributes to weight loss can motivate you to drink more throughout the day. Here are some insights:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Burns Calories:** As noted earlier, drinking water can temporarily boost your metabolism. The more calories you burn, the easier it can be to lose weight.
- **Reduces Liquid Calorie Intake:** Substituting sugary drinks like soda or juice with water significantly lowers your caloric intake. This simple switch can lead to weight loss over time.
- **Promotes Healthy Choices:** Hydration often goes hand-in-hand with making healthier dietary choices. When you’re well-hydrated, cravings can diminish, leading you to make better food selections.
- **Impacts Hormones:** Proper hydration helps regulate hormones that play a role in hunger and satiety, such as ghrelin and leptin. Keeping these in check can naturally reduce your appetite.

### Hydration into Your Diet

Integrating more water into your lifestyle doesn't have to be boring or bland. Here are some practical tips:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you. It serves as a constant reminder to drink more.
- **Set Timers:** Use alarms or reminders on your phone to encourage regular sipping throughout the day.
- **Flavor Your Water:** If plain water is unappealing, try adding slices of fruit, like lemon, lime, or cucumber. This adds flavor without adding calories.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Make it a habit to drink a glass of water before each meal. It can reduce calorie intake and help you feel satisfied faster.

### How Much Water Do You Need?

The amount of water you need can vary depending on factors like age, weight, climate, and activity level. A general guideline is to aim for about:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Approximately 8-10 cups (64-80 ounces) of water daily for healthy adults.
- More when you exercise, especially in hot weather. Aim to drink 16-20 ounces of water for every hour of vigorous exercise.

Listening to your body is key. Pay attention to signs of thirst and drink accordingly. Remember that food also contributes to your hydration, with fruits and vegetables containing a significant percentage of water.

### The Bottom Line

Staying hydrated is not only essential for your overall health but also fundamentally linked to effective weight loss. By prioritizing your hydration, you can enhance your metabolism, control your appetite, and make healthier food choices. Water is a simple yet powerful tool in your weight loss journey. Make it an integral part of your daily routine, and you may just notice the difference!

Daily Routine: Incorporating the H2O Diet into Your Life
--------------------------------------------------------

### Start Your Day Right

Your morning sets the tone for the day. Begin with a glass of water as soon as you wake up. This simple act helps kickstart your metabolism and rehydrates your body after a night of sleep. Aim for at least 8 ounces of water to get things going. You can also add a slice of lemon to flavor your drink and boost your vitamin C intake.

### Hydration Throughout the Day

Set reminders on your phone or use a water tracking app to ensure you stay hydrated throughout the day. Here’s a plan you can follow:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Mid-Morning:** Drink another glass of water with your morning snack.
- **Lunch:** Pair your meal with a glass of water, and consider a salad filled with water-rich vegetables.
- **Afternoon:** Before reaching for that cup of coffee, drink a glass of water instead.
- **Dinner:** Enjoy a glass of water during your meal and opt for steamed vegetables.
- **Evening:** Wind down with a soothing herbal tea (caffeine-free) to increase your hydration a little more.

By spreading water intake throughout the day, you'll not only stay hydrated but also help curb unnecessary snacking.

### Mindful Eating

With the H2O diet, it’s crucial to become more aware of your eating habits. Focus on water-rich foods that also provide essential nutrients. Some great options include:

### Track Your Progress

Keeping a journal of your daily water intake and meals can give you insights into your habits. Write down how you feel as you adjust to this new routine. It’s essential to recognize the benefits you experience, such as improved energy levels and better digestion, since these can motivate you to stick with the H2O diet.

### Exercise

Adding regular physical activity into your routine is a vital part of any healthy lifestyle, including the H2O diet. Hydration plays a critical role in performance and recovery. Here’s how to integrate exercise:

- Drink water before you start your workout.

The key to successfully adopting the H2O diet is consistency. Aim to make these practices part of your daily life. Over time, drinking water will become a natural habit. You may even start to notice how good it feels to stay hydrated and how it positively impacts your health.

By integrating the H2O diet into your daily routine, you can enjoy clearer skin, more energy, and better overall well-being. Remember, the journey to health is a marathon, not a sprint. Keep your focus on gradual changes, and soon enough, you’ll find yourself thriving on the H2O diet.

Potential Benefits and Challenges of the H2O Diet
-------------------------------------------------

The H2O diet has gained popularity as a hydration-based approach to weight management and overall wellness. By prioritizing water intake, this diet encourages individuals to consume more fluids, which can lead to a range of potential benefits. However, like any diet, it comes with its own challenges that individuals should consider before diving in.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Potential Benefits

One of the significant advantages of the H2O diet is its emphasis on hydration. Water is crucial for numerous bodily functions, and adequate intake can lead to:

- **Improved Metabolism:** Drinking water can boost your metabolism, as the body requires energy to process it. Some studies suggest that drinking cold water can increase calorie burning.
- **Appetite Control:** Sometimes, thirst can be mistaken for hunger. Staying well-hydrated may help control your appetite, leading to less overeating.
- **Enhanced Energy Levels:** Dehydration can lead to fatigue and decreased energy. Proper hydration can make you feel more energetic throughout the day.
- **Better Skin Health:** Drinking enough water can improve skin elasticity and appearance. Many people notice a glow in their complexion when they are properly hydrated.
- **Kidney Function:** Adequate fluid intake supports kidney health by helping them filter waste more effectively.

### Scientific Studies Supporting Hydration

Research indicates that hydration plays a vital role in numerous physiological processes. In one study, participants who increased their water intake reported feeling fuller, which helped them consume fewer calories during meals. Additionally, another study highlighted a connection between optimal hydration and improved athletic performance.

### Challenges of the H2O Diet

While the H2O diet presents several attractive benefits, potential challenges arise that need careful consideration:

- **Potential Overhydration:** Some individuals might overestimate their water needs, leading to a rare but dangerous condition known as hyponatremia, which is an electrolyte imbalance caused by drinking excessive amounts of water.
- **Balanced Nutrition:** Focusing too much on water can lead some to neglect the consumption of essential nutrients. It’s crucial to accompany water intake with a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals.
- **Frequent Bathroom Visits:** Increased water consumption often leads to more frequent urination, which may be inconvenient, especially for those with busy schedules.
- **Individual Variation:** Hydration needs can vary significantly from one person to another based on factors like daily activity, climate, and body size. What works for one individual may not yield the same results for another.

- **Set Hydration Goals:** Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, but adjust based on your individual needs and activity level.
- **Infuse Your Water:** Make hydration enjoyable by adding slices of fruits, herbs, or vegetables for flavor. This can make it easier to reach your daily intake goals.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to your thirst cues. Drink when you are thirsty and adjust your intake based on how you feel.
- **Combine With Nutrient-Rich Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as cucumbers and watermelon, to boost hydration and nutrients.

### Final Thoughts

The H2O diet can serve as an effective strategy for enhancing hydration and potentially aiding weight management. However, as with any dietary approach, it’s important to listen to your body and ensure you balance water intake with other nutritional needs. By being mindful of both the benefits and challenges, you can create a sustainable and health-promoting lifestyle.

Success Stories: Transformations Through the H2O Diet
-----------------------------------------------------

The H2O diet has gained attention for its unique approach to weight loss and health improvement. This intriguing diet emphasizes the importance of hydration, using water as a central element to enhance overall well-being. Many people across different backgrounds have turned to this diet, leading to remarkable transformations. Let’s explore some of the success stories and see how the H2O diet has positively influenced lives.

### Hydration as a Game-Changer

Staying hydrated is key to any successful diet. Many individuals who adopted the H2O diet reported a newfound energy level and clearer minds. For example, John, a 35-year-old office worker, struggled with fatigue and weight gain. After switching to the H2O diet, he started consuming at least eight glasses of water daily. Within three months, John lost 25 pounds. He credited his success to improved hydration, which helped him maintain his energy levels throughout busy workdays.

### Support from Community and Accountability

Another inspiring transformation comes from Maria, a dedicated mother of two. She often found it hard to focus on her health amidst family obligations. When Maria joined a local H2O diet group, she found support and motivation from others on their journey. Sharing her daily water intake and meal ideas kept her accountable. In six months, Maria dropped 30 pounds and noticed her clothes fitting better than ever. She exclaimed, ""The power of community made all the difference for me!""

### Making Water Interesting

Many people struggle with drinking plain water, but the H2O diet encourages flavoring it with fruits and herbs. Sarah, a fitness enthusiast, began infusing her water with slices of lemon, strawberries, and fresh mint. This simple change not only made her hydration routine exciting but kept her away from sugary drinks. Sarah lost 15 pounds in two months, proving that small modifications can lead to significant results. She advises, ""Experiment with flavors to keep it fun!""

### Easy Integration into Daily Life

One of the appealing aspects of the H2O diet is its simplicity. It doesn’t require strict meal planning or expensive supplements. Consider Mark, a busy college student who balanced work and studies. He felt overwhelmed by traditional diets, leading to unhealthy eating choices. After learning about the H2O diet, Mark made a commitment to drink water before meals. This simple habit helped him control his portions and ultimately led to a loss of 20 pounds over four months.

### Boosting Metabolism

Some people have reported additional benefits of the H2O diet, including better digestion and increased metabolism. Lucas, a health-conscious individual, incorporated this diet into his wellness routine. He noticed after a couple of weeks that his metabolism had picked up, and he felt less bloated after meals. Lucas was thrilled to share that he lost 18 pounds in just six weeks, attributing his quick progress primarily to increased hydration and the removal of carbonated drinks from his diet.

### Emotional Well-being

It’s not just the physical changes that matter; many people experience emotional benefits when following the H2O diet. Rachel, a mental health advocate, found that drinking water throughout the day helped her stay focused and positive. She often battles anxiety, and hydrating properly became part of her self-care routine. Rachel reports, ""Every time I sip water, I feel like I’m taking a step toward a healthier me, both inside and out."" During her journey, Rachel lost 10 pounds and noticed an increased sense of well-being.

1h77u53,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1h77u53/9th_day_of_no_money_spent_on_gambling/,9th day of no money spent on gambling,"I think this may be the longest time in the last decade that I've not gambled without external limitations ( traveling/being off the grid with no internet etc ). I don't think I've ever had the mental space to understand truly just how detrimental gambling has been in my life. 

I worked really hard for years to build up an investment portfolio that I then blew over the last two years. I recently reviewed all the trades I had to make to cover my gambling losses and aside from having to liquidate close to six figures in assets, I missed out on a 100% return on the portfolio in the last 2 years. I could have been on my way to a solid foundation for financial stability, but now I’m back at the very start having to rebuild from scratch. 

Aside from the explicit monetary loss there is also the incredibly painful realization of just how much time I’ve lost to this disease. Tens of thousands of hours over the past decade. There were times where every waking moment of the day I was gambling on my phone. While I’m working, while I’m at the gym, driving, walking to a coffee shop, I always had one of the apps running. There were days where I was on my phone in bed till 5:30 am chasing losses. This has taken a tremendous toll on me physically and mentally. My vision has gotten worse, my attention span is nonexistent, the chronic stress snowballed into severe anxiety, not to mention the obvious fact that investing ten thousand hours into anything productive would’ve yielded tremendous results. I could’ve built multiple companies by now, or thrived in my career. Instead I’m a shell of who I once was, struggling to get through the day. 

Most importantly this sickness destroyed relationships. How can you trust someone who promises to change, be more present, caring, but next thing you know they’re back in their own world. Fueled by anger and self loathing from another losing gambling session. 

I wish you all a stable recovery. ",2,1733400944.0,problemgambling,0,1.0,False

1h77tsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1h77tsj/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1733400909.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
1h77sa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/coqinu/comments/1h77sa2/the_future_the_flippening/,"The Future, The Flippening","It was Monday 1st of March, 2025. My giant golden rooster alarm went off at 5am. I laughed. Old habits. 

Just a few months ago, 5am meant I had to go to my 12-hour shift as a professional shit-eater at my wife's boyfriend Jamal's manure testing facility. But ever since the flippening, my days have been quiet. Peaceful, even. I watched the sun come up while I had coffee. My 14 wives jerked me off while I read the news. Elon Musk came round and begged me to punch him in the face again, just so he could feel my skin against his. I did a runny poo and forced Jamal to wipe my gooch with $100 bills that he wasn't allowed to keep afterwards. I drove all 18 of my Lamborghinis to the beach and ran over some folk I didn't like the look of. It was bliss. 

In the news that day, the people of El Salvador had revolted. It was a bloodbath. Nayib Bukele had been publicly bukkaked due to his foolish investments in Bitcoin, which was now third on the list of cryptocurrencies by market cap. Some hard-working El Salvadorian coq enthusiasts had fought and jerked their way past limp army barracks and into the National Palace to reinvigorate the country's flaccid economy with their heaving coqbags. Avax was also involved somehow.

Gary Gensler, former head of the SEC and now Supreme Leader of the Taliban, had released another hostage video on his OnlyFans. This time he demanded 5 whole coq coins for the lives of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, whom the Taliban had recently captured. A total of 10 coq coins were eventually paid by the US government: 5 for Meghan and the other 5 to keep Harry. The world once again admired the US for their negotiation with terrorists. Harry was consensually bukkaked live on Al Jazeera shortly after.

Vitalik Buterin had finally been locked up for massive fraud, ironically in the same minimum-security cell as Do Kwan, SBF and Donald Trump Jr. The article rumoured that the 4 of them were issuing a new stablecoin. Avax was not involved at all. 

A moose was hit by a car in Canada. The government formally apologised to the moose's family. The driver was given $40 and sent to rehab in the Bahamas. 

In the lifestyle section there was a follow up article on that guy from Tiger King and Zendaya, who had recently been exposed as the creators of Bitcoin, AKA Satoshi Nakamoto. Turns out they had a great interior decorator. It also turned out that 'Satoshi Nakamoto' was a spelling error - they had originally tried to write 'GrossBalls69'. The whole thing was meant to be a rug pull but they lost the seed phrase. Then some nerds took it over. No one cared anymore because Bitcoin only had a market cap of $66k, and $COQINU was well over 500 trillion. All other cryptos (except for Avax) had crashed and disappeared. 

I looked out at the beach from my cars. It's amazing how life can change so quickly. 

Then my phone rang. It was Elon Gensler. CUCK! No wait, it was my rooster alarm! I wasn't at the beach, I was naked at Jamal's house! CUCKDOODLE! No. NO! NOOOOOO -

I don't know what all would be possible based on game limitations and the vision for the park, but figured it wouldn't hurt to provide some food for thought. I'd love to see some other ideas.

1. For all those who want a milkshake ride....Is it possible to build a drop tower ride where the building for the queue looks like a milkshake and the ride is the ""straw"" for it? 

2. A name for the water park could be Tim Apple Tides.  Instead of burgers everything gets apple themed.

3. For all those who are asking for fries....Theme the queue for a ride like a french fry forest maze.

4. There can be a land called Extras Extravaganza.  There can be the Caffeine Crashers bumper cars which could be coffee themed. The milkshake ride mentioned before. The carousel of desserts (How many free desserts were handed out for better reviews?) It could be a place for all those things that don't fit the other areas.  The mascots for the area could be Ratuu and Ratrina.

5. For the water park the boys might want to look at some places like Indiana Beach where it is located on a river with a lot of trees since their park is also not an oceanfront area, but inland waters.",3,1733400686.0,JamesTurnerYT,0,1.0,False
