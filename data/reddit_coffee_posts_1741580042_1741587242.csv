Random objects will go missing or be in places they obviously should not be (such as my GF's birth control medication, which was found underneath the oven after tearing the house apart). Sounds of people distantly talking or walking around will come from the basement or attic, mostly at night.  A few times there has been a horrible, rapid banging coming from the floor that sounded like someone was trying to break through the floorboards. These things almost exclusively happen when I am by myself or the only one awake.

The most frequent and frustrating happening is that my phone has been ""falling"" off of flat, level surfaces when no one is touching it or the surface it's on. It doesn't just fall onto the floor below, it will usually arc across the room a solid 6-12 inches away from the surface, as if it has been forcibly pushed off. This only happens when I am sitting near my phone but not directly looking at it or touching it. For several months this has happened several times a week, but only when I'm the only person in the room.

I have been keeping this to myself, as my girlfriend is a very anxious, spiritual person and I don't want to scare her. I don't typically buy-in to supernatural stuff, so me even mentioning my concerns would probably put her on high alert. 

I have been trying to convince myself that I've just been going stir-crazy from working from home, but today multiple people besides me saw my phone fly off the living room coffee table. I left my phone in the room with my GF and her friend to get a drink, and came back several minutes later to them looking unsettled. My girlfriend, without prior knowledge of this happening, explained that they had both witnessed my phone fly off the middle of the coffee table onto the floor. Her friend was clearly uncomfortable with what she had just seen and just said she didn't want to talk about it. I shrugged it off to avoid making a big deal out of it, but I'm now feeling equal parts alarmed and validated.

Frankly I'm still not convinced that there isn't a logical explanation for this, but I have run out of explanations. As a longtime lurker of Reddit, I have checked the house for CO2, natural gas leaks, and radon. I don't know what advice you can reasonably give for something like this, but I'm open to suggestions at this point. ",1,1741587109.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False

1j7rm4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j7rm4x/is_my_sister_narcissistic/,Is my sister narcissistic?,"We are both adults and lately I have been extremely emotionally unstable and she is one of the reasons. She's very unpredictable, moody, unbothered.

* She often speaks in a defensive/accusatory tone
* She says things like ""do you hate me?"" ""you don't like talking to me?"" (Even though I told her multiple times that that is never the case and that I feel uncomfortable when she says that)
* She never smiles, always speaks monotone and never puts any effort into appearing 'nice' which I tried to tolerate but it makes it hard for me to tell her how I feel like I'm not wanted, because she will instantly justify it with ""I just don't like smiling"" or ""that's just how my voice is""
* Not a single time did I ever tell her that something she did was hurtful without her defending, justifying or straight up spinning the whole thing around and directing it at me. Not even once.
* When she is tired/hungry/sleepy, she is more rude and uses said reasons as justification for her behaviour but when I overreact (for example getting emotionally triggered due to a medical condition), I am shamed for my behaviour and told to do better.

Even though I'm the oldest, I feel like a doormat. I always do nice things for her, make her coffee, grab her food, help her with chores but she never does anything for me unless I ask her and then she gets upset at me when I distance myself and focus on myself, she paints it like I hate spending time with her, when in reality, I just hate being made to feel like shit.

1j7rlrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1j7rlrh/have_you_tried_empirical_water/,Have you tried empirical water?,"I’ve been experimenting with different water minerals for some time now. My go to is usually Apax or Lotus, which I mix with zero TDS water.

Among most coffee professionals I’ve spoken to, they tend to recommend Lotus for its ease of use and customization.

However, I’ve recently been experimenting with Empirical Water and can’t seem to form a solid opinion on it. I did a side-by-side taste test with Empirical and Lotus and had a hard time distinguishing between them. It was a bit easier with Apax, since Empirical seemed to prolong the lingering aftertaste, while Apax brought out more nuance and enhanced the notes that were already present, like florals.

They all seem to work well with different coffees. I can see Empirical working great with some coffees, while Apax is better suited for more delicate, high-end beans that require fine tuning. Then again more testing is probably needed. 

I’m curious to hear if anyone else has used Empirical Water and what your opinion is. Have you done a side-by-side test with other water products? What differences and similarities did you encounter?

Astral woke up the next day, thankfully not on the ceiling. Lucifer was sitting on the couch watching TV and squinting at the screen. His coat was hanging on the back of the door next to Astral’s. He clicked a pen a few times and noticed Astral sitting up. 

“Morning sunshine.” Astral snarked as he rolled out of the bed and jumped at the cold floor. 

“Yes. Wood floors, remember.” Lucifer nodded and pointed the pen at the screen. “You’ve met Alan Quain, yes?” 

“In passing.” Astral nodded, “Why? He punch a senator, finally? Did he deck Kincaid?” Astral grinned.

“There was a mysterious fire at his home during a time when his children are changing schools.” Lucifer nodded, “I’ll need some Watchers on them.” 

“What?” Astral asked.

“I have been tasked with setting up monitors, of a sort, by Metty.” Lucifer sighed, “And to continue teaching you what it is to be a mal'akh.” 

“Don’t spy on kids, Lucifer.” Astral sighed, “It’s creepy and you can’t beat that kind of accusation, not the way you dress and act.” 

Lucifer looked up for a moment and then recoiled in horror. “I wouldn’t be watching! But you have a point, it is unsettling and one of the children can see the dead and the dead can see us.” 

Astral nodded, “I think I met the red-head too.” Astral chuckled, “Professionally short thing that hid behind her sister a lot.” 

“What’s the context?” Lucifer asked.

“Punched out a daemon with an Egyptian name. It was going after some rich guy. Quain bailed me out while the rich guy straightened it all out. Guy wasn’t completely gone so he had me charged with assault at first.” Astral sighed, “Got asked to help with another problem, but I got told to stay away and...” He paused, “Like a good lap dog...” 

“You aren’t to blame, you were corrupted, brainwashed.” Lucifer stood up, “Likely why they wanted you away from them. The Quains would be the Church’s worst enemies if they knew what was going on. Even with the wife being a Catholic.”

“So why stay the night?” Astral asked as he walked to grab his coat.

“Because you needed someone to watch your back, and theirs.” Lucifer nodded, “And Metatron asked me to.” 

Astral arched an eyebrow.

“He is a sibling. We may enjoy poking each other, but we will help. Even if I cannot reap a reward, I will help keep my Father’s house in order.” Lucifer sighed, “And find him if I can.” He grabbed his coat.

“Yeah.” Astral sighed, “That’s still got me slightly off balance.” 

“Try being me.” Lucifer smiled, “I feel like life is a freefall right now.” 

“Maybe get some air, perspective or something.” Astral clapped Lucifer on the shoulder, “Can’t have my teacher shook like me.” 

Lucifer paused and nodded, then smiled. “As you wish, my prince.” 

“Oh fuck you.” Astral opened the door and went down the hall as Lucifer burst into laughter.

Astral quickly knocked on the door to Ukiko’s room and it opened not long after that. Ukiko was dressed and Ariane was holding her hand. They were both packed and ready to go.

“You two sleep okay?” Astral asked.

“The beds here aren’t fluffy.” Ariane grumbled.

“No.” Ukiko agreed. “I need coffee.” 

“My treat, and a juice of choice for Ari.” Astral smiled down.

“Apple! No, Orange!” Ariane smiled. “Can I get Kiwi?” 

Astral nodded, “Some breakfast, then we face down the landlord.” 

Ukiko nodded. “Got your police report and mine.” Ukiko sighed, “I hope he’ll listen.” 

“I hope he doesn’t decide to kick us out on some technicality.” Astral joined her sigh.

“Thankfully the law keeps us protected and he’d have to prove we aren’t paying or that we endangered other tenants.” Ukiko said, “But I’ve seen less slimy weasels pull nasty tricks.” 

Lucifer silently joined them and the group went down to check out. Astral took all of a few seconds, but Ukiko found that her room still had several days reserved on it. Once the large frame of Kenzō Kaneda walked in, she just shook her head and stared at him.

“I have made an error.” Her father said flatly, “What have I done?” 

“I was set to pay.” Ukiko said, “I was fine day to day.” 

Kenzō then noticed Astral and nodded to him. “Apologies, daughter.” He then nodded to the clerk who quickly checked Ukiko out of the hotel. He then turned to the group, “Please allow me to treat you all to breakfast.” 

“Even him?” Astral pointed to Lucifer.

“He fought well.” Kenzō nodded.

“Oh joy, I can eat with the big boys!” Lucifer grinned, “Weren’t too bad yourself. How’s the finger?”

Kenzō held up his left hand which was missing its ring finger. “I failed my men and they paid for it again.” 

“Time to bury the past, I assume?” Astral asked.

“Time to start it, yes.” Kenzō nodded, “Tokyo has a new protector after all. One who can see all the threats.” He nodded to Astral.

Astral chuckled, then realized the man was serious. “Oh come on. I don’t need more of this.” He began to hyperventilate, but Ukiko was at his side.

“Slow, focus on each breath.” She said as she rubbed his back.

“I seem to keep making errors.” Kenzō sighed.

“You couldn’t have known.” Lucifer sighed, “We’ll explain on the way.” 

“No.” Astral said, “I don’t want to talk just yet.” He was still catching his breath while Ariane held onto his hand.

Kenzō nodded, “Then perhaps, at the meal. I can get us a private table at a good restaurant.” 

“Do they have Kiwi juice?” Ariane asked.

“They will if I ask.” Kenzō then noticed Ukiko staring at him. 

“He means they’ll try if he asks.” Ukiko said, slightly gritting her teeth. 

“Yes, we will ask nicely.” Kenzō smiled.

“We going with him?” Astral asked as he looked at Ukiko.

Ukiko nodded, “I need to.” 

Astral nodded and took a deep breath and straightened up. 

The group followed the Yakuza patriarch to his car where Otto opened the door for them and let them get in individually. Astral and Ukiko took the seats facing towards the man. Lucifer sat on the same side as the patriarch and Ariane took the opportunity to bounce back and forth between the seats at moments they were stopped. Finally they pulled up to a large restaurant near the docks. When the group got out, Astral immediately stepped back as his senses lit up in reaction to all the yokai he could detect. Most were simply working or dining but the sheer number of them was almost enough to overload his senses.

“Temper yourself.” Lucifer nodded, “I know it’s odd, but they are technically not-human and will trigger our senses in large numbers.” 

“Wait until you have to face a Night Parade.” Kenzō said, “Then you will know true revulsion.” He sneered at the last part

“Like the movies and stuff?” Astral asked.

“Worse.” Lucifer sighed, “It happens once a year, usually at the start of summer. All the Yokai who hunt humans descend on the cities. Any human caught outside is fair game. Good yokai and exorcist class heroes can fight to give them a chance, but it will always happen.” 

“It was the cost of asking for their help when the Purge threatened us all.” Kenzō shook his head, “A decision made in desperation.” 

Astral nodded, “I’ll break their jaws.” 

Kenzō roared with a deep laugh. “Good.” 

The group walked in and were seated in a private dining area. Kenzō whispered something to their server who smiled at Ariane and quickly darted off, only to return with a pitcher of kiwi juice. They all sat down and Ken was with them, the oni looked a little displeased at Lucifer’s presence but acknowledged his bosses’ choice to invite him. 

“So, I have invited you all here, one so you may eat a good breakfast.” Kenzō smiled, “And two to exchange information, it seems.” 

Astral nodded and went to speak but shook his head, “Lucifer, please?” 

Lucifer nodded, “Astral has recently had his ancestry revealed and with it, the simple yet terrifying reality that he will sit upon The Metatron’s throne when his life comes to an end. If he so chooses.” 

“Not much of a choice for me.” Astral sighed, “And then you dropped ‘Protector of the City’ on me.” 

Kenzō blinked. “Oh.” 

“Boss.” Ken stared in shock, “I think he wins the drama prize.” 

Astral shrugged, “There’s more, but it’s a play close to the chest sort of deal.” 

Ukiko looked at Astral quizzically.

“Trust me, you don’t want to know right now.” Astral sighed. “I don’t want to know right now, but I do so I’m stuck with it.” 

“And the Church came after me in coming after him.” Ukiko nodded.

“Doubt it.” Ken sighed, “Took a look into this priest, he’s not a licensed hero, at least not with any public registry.” 

Astral looked up, “Powers?” 

“He’s your typical blockhead type according to my contacts. Strength and endurance.” He pushed a picture to Astral.

Father Roan Farren had a bandage on his left cheek as he was speaking with a shorter man with a bowl cut. The shorter man had a wide smile and thin lips with eyes that had a strange darkness in them, like pits of despair. Astral just barely recognized the man.

“That second one is more my concern, they wouldn’t send a strong man after me.” Astral explained. “The second man is Alexy Yuri, a known hero that works with the church, specifically to lock Nephilim down. He cancels all powers in about three hundred feet or so.”

“Babel is not a power and cannot be stopped.” Lucifer advised, “But he can stop the Light.” 

“Honestly, it makes us almost even.” Astral grinned, “This might be fun.” 

Kenzō blinked in confusion, “What?” 

“Most nephilim are taught to use ranged fighting styles. I’m a melee expert, just like him. He might expect it, he might not, but either way won’t see Babel coming until it’s too late.” Astral tapped Farren’s face on the photo. “They sent this guy for Ukiko, not me.” 

“What?” Kenzō growled.

“She defied them.” Lucifer said, “This is not the Church of Fifty Years ago Mr. Kaneda, they seek power, likely to what they see as a noble end. But everyone who isn't with them is against them.” 

“And Mammon’s decided Japan is his backyard now, so I can’t just up and leave to help the others or break them of the brainwashing.” Astral sighed.

“Brainwashing?” Ken asked

“You really think two thousand Nephilim just decided to willingly work with the Church?” Astral laughed, “No, we got put through the ringer as kids...” Astral closed his eyes and for a moment he was back in a training room with his worst combat trainer snarling at him. He shot up in his seat and realized he was safe.

“Memories do not fade.” Kenzō said, “Digging them up, even if you don’t mean to, can be rough.” 

Ariane moved her chair closer to Astral and offered him a glass of kiwi juice. Astral smiled and hugged her and took the offer. 

“Yeah, I know.” Astral said, “Been happening since I found some old videos of my parents.” 

Kenzō nodded in understanding.

Ukiko finally shook herself from the shock of Astral’s statement. “They came for me?” 

Astral nodded, “I suspected as much, but I needed to be sure. Powers are what sold me on it. Send a typical strong guy after me and they’re toast unless they’re suitably invulnerable and we don’t have a Superman, so not happening.” 

“Superman?” Lucifer laughed, “I miss those comics.” 

“Digital archives.” Ken said, “Unless you mean new stories. Can’t help you there.” 

“So what, will they try again?” Ukiko asked.

“Ariane drove him off, right? With this Heresy spirit?” Astral clarified.

Ukiko nodded.

Astral looked at the young girl carefully drinking her kiwi juice. “No. You’re irrelevant now.” 

“I will rip them apart.” Lucifer said flatly.

“Not if I do it first.” Ukiko growled and straightened up in shock at her own aggression. 

“Daughter, you have some training, but not enough to face these men.” Kenzō said, “The girl has a better chance.” 

Ukiko glared at her father. “Then someone better teach me.” 

Kenzō cleared his throat.

“I can.” Astral suggested. “Self defense comes in many forms and Babel is supposed to be used by humans too.” 

“Babel?” Ken asked, “You’ve said that several times.” 

“Divine language of Yaweh.” Lucifer said, “Astral has an innate connection to it by being Metatron’s heir.” 

“You really did come back to a lot of changes.” Kenzō shook his head. 

“With some as well.” Astral nodded, “What’s your news?” 

“I will be retiring.” Kenzō said, “In three months I will be handing the control of the Families to Ken.” 

“I fully expect some rebellion and split offs.” Ken sighed, “The boss was the glue. But I understand. A man has to rest sometime, and he’s fueled by angry souls.” 

Kenzō just nodded.

“Not all of them are.” Ariane smiled. “Juice?” She offered a glass to the patriarch.

Kenzō froze and nodded as he took a glass from the child.

“She’s good at that.” Lucifer smiled, “May I have some?” 

“Sure!” Ariane poured the pitcher into the glass with oddly little struggle.

Astral watched and squinted only to see a happy smiling man appear before him. His skin was brown and he wore a simple robe and he was helping Ariane lift and hold the pitcher. The man gave a playful wink and Astral toppled out of his chair.

Kenzō looked at the Nephilim in concern.

“Finally saw him?” Lucifer laughed, “I imagine he had that shit eating grin as usual.” 

Astral stood up and dusted himself off. “Not shit eating, but man that was a shock.” Astral looked again but could not see the Son anymore.

“Who?” Ken asked.

“The big J.C. is Ariane’s invisible friend.” Astral sighed. 

“He’s a good friend.” Ariane said simply as she walked the glass to Lucifer.

“He is.” Lucifer smiled, “When not being a pain in my rear.” 

“Be nice Luci.” Ariane pouted.

“I’ll try.” Lucifer sighed.

“Try hard.” Astral grinned.

“Don’t.” Lucifer said as he saw Astral’s grin.

“Don’t know what you mean. Luci.” Astral sat back down.

Ken exchanged a worried glance with his boss but neither of the men voiced any specific concerns. 

“Right.” Ukiko said as she shook her head and tried to process everything that had happened. “Father, can we order now?” 

Kenzō nodded, “Probably for the best.” 

“Pancakes!” Ariane smiled, “Bueberry ones!” 

“I can actually get behind that.” Astral smiled.

“You know...” Ukiko nodded. “I agree.” 

“I will have strawberry waffles.” Lucifer glared at Astral.

“Contrarian.” Astral snorted.

“I think I’ll have my usual.” Kenzō nodded, “Ken?” 

“My usual.” Ken sighed and leaned in to whisper to his boss. “When do we tell them about the thing?” 

Kenzō shook his head, “Later.” 

The meal proceeded after that. Small talk didn’t happen and most parties remained silent, except for Ariane playing a guessing game with Lucifer who cheerfully entertained the innocent child. Within a few hours the meal and meeting was concluded with both parties having shared valuable information and progress. Once it was over Otto and Akira drove Astral and his group back to their apartments. Lucifer remained behind to talk with Kenzō and Ken, about his own missions. 

The three of them took the elevator up and were not surprised to find an eviction notice on Ukiko’s door. Or rather a filed notification of the intent to evict, the reason being cited as she had caused massive damage to the pipes in the building when she was attacked. Ukiko’s face turned red with anger the more she read, until Astral took it from her and read it himself.

“So the language he’s using is pretty strict, but he may have a case.” Astral sighed.

“What? How, I was attacked, Ariane saved us!” Ukiko snapped. “Plus, I’m the lawyer here!” 

“I know, and trust me I’d side with you but it all comes down to language, something I’ve learned is a gift from God for me.” He gave an annoyed sigh, “But it boils down to this, Ariane isn’t registered.” 

Ukiko went to argue but stopped, “Fuck!” 

“Bad word!” Ariane frowned as she looked up from her cartoons.

“I know, sweety, I know.” Ukiko sighed. “So I can’t use her powers to say, ‘hey I was saved’, because there’s no record and they won’t stay.” 

“Bingo.” Astral nodded, “Good news, as you said, is that it's going to take him months to get to court.” 

“So I can potentially fight it.” Ukiko frowned.

“Is it worth it?” Astral asked. “Really worth it to fight to keep this place?” 

Ukiko squinted in confusion.

“You’re a target now.” Astral said, “Means you have to think about security, because they’ll take advantage of your lack of it.”

Ukiko sighed, “I don’t know, I always felt safe.”

“Until a strong man came in and made your door useless.” Astral nodded. “This place is safe from thugs and criminals, not hitmen, not super powered assholes. You want something that safe you have to look. Really look.” 

Ukiko nodded and furrowed her brow.

Astral waited while Ariane continued to watch her shows.

“I thought I knew enough about the paranormal.” Ukiko sighed, “Guess I was wrong.” She wrung her hands in worry.

“To be fair, so did I, but I was lied to, it turns out.” Astral chuckled, “But what I do know is at your disposal.” 

Ukiko nodded, “Can you find us a place? You said the edge of the city last night.” 

Astral nodded, “May not be as good as I thought, I figured yokai would trend to the edges and yokai aren’t half bad and like communities.” 

“Yokai?” Ukiko nodded and went to her office and came back with a sheet of paper. “These were locations I was told to keep your apartment away from, it’s why this was the best option.” 

Astral took the list. “Well damn...” He caught the common denominator easily. “Yokai neighborhoods, can’t have me getting friendly with what they want me to kill.” 

Ukiko gasped.

“Yeah, if this had been last year...” Astral shuddered, “I didn’t always listen to them but I thought they had the right idea then.” He sighed, “Let me take a look first, I can sense aggression in paranormal non-humans.” 

Ukiko blinked in confusion, “So not Rana.” 

Astral nodded, “Correct, or the jerkass from the Galactic Patrol Corps.”

“What about the, you know.” Ukiko was hesitant to use the name of the Purge.

“I mean that’s their default, but if you mean the descendents, no I can’t.” He paused, “Marked either, now that I think about it.” 

“Because they’re mostly human or something else?” Ukiko asked for clarification.

“No idea.” Astral smiled as he stood up. “I’ll go check some of these out.” He paused, “Could you do me a favor? I have some video files I need moved off a site, could you do that?’ 

Ukiko nodded, “If you give me the password.” 

Astral walked over and pulled a piece of paper off his notepad after putting the login information on it. He smiled and put it in her hand. 

“What are the videos of, if I can ask?” Ukiko asked.

“My parents, feel free to watch a few.” Astral chuckled. “Don’t worry my mom doesn’t seem to bite through the screen.” 

Ukiko was clearly confused and Astral just left with a laugh.

She's kind of been pushed to the side for a bit, but she's very nice. Stuffed animals don't really do that much for me because they're inanimate, but they are cute. Also, I never really felt like having much of a girlhood phase. I'm gonna be transitioning at 22, and kid stuff usually doesn't appeal to me much. As weird as it is to say, I'm probably older than most of this sub because y'all are like 15. Nevertheless, I'm thinking about getting more stuffed animals now because I think that they're cute. I'm thinking about getting a Pochita from Chainsaw Man, because I've been enjoying that manga. I might also look at Moomin plushies. Yes, I said that I moved past kid stuff, but I'm talking about plushies here!!! Also, I fell in love with Finland when I visited the country in August. I just opened some Moomin-branded coffee that I bought on a ferry there, and it's some really good stuff.

On a different note, I kind of like blogging here more than writing in a diary. I think that it's me looking for attention or validation. I'm not an attention seeker, but I seek attention, especially from people who may understand my situation. I think that with my current situation, transitioning would make it easier to connect with people, but I'm too scared to do it. I also feel like I'm going to be mostly alone transitioning, which makes it harder. I do expect a little bit of polarization among people I know, but I am kind of ready for that. My appointment for hormones is in a week, and it's something that I look forward to.

I would love it if a lover swooped into my life and saved me, but I can't really expect that to happen. I just can't get the urge for a connection with someone else out of my head. I also can't really do much about my dysphoria right now. Nevertheless, I'm growing out my hair, and I'm going to tie it in the back to hide the hair loss on my head (it works with my hair loss pattern).

I think that I might open a blog somewhere after I'm publicly out as a woman. I might try to make it quite a bit less intimate because I'd probably put my real life name there, but I like blogging. My photography professor at my university told me that I always have a story to tell when I show a photo to the class. Blogging also would give me something other than doomscrolling while I'm waiting for this damn rice cooker to heat up because I put the wrong plug into the socket hours ago :|

I’ve applied for 348 jobs in total so far. 

I ensured they had “Analyst or Consultant” in the job title and were entry level. I don’t have a passion for IT or an idea of what job I want. I hoped to land some entry-level job in a growing industry when picking my major. 

My resume is ok it’s more focused towards real estate because I decided to get my real estate license and I had a real estate internship where I was a transaction analyst. 

I’m having no luck and am unsure what to do. I’ve connected with people on LinkedIn, attended coffee and informational chats to learn more about individual roles, and applied during business hours. I reach out to and am ghosted by recruiters. 

My dad works as a manager at Toyota and said his team received 670 applications for an instructional designer job he posted a week ago in the tech industry. 

I guess I am feeling discouraged.

Does anyone know of a company or job title/career path recommendation for an entry-level position I can get with an information technology degree paying at least 50,000?

*  Living in downtown Pittsburgh 
* Grad student (aka professional procrastinator)
* Always down for food adventures 
* Enjoys gaming, movies, and the occasional deep-dive into random topics 
* My only mode of transport is the bus, so all meetups must align with the power of public transit

* Someone who enjoys exploring the city (because I still have no idea where anything is) 
* Coffee shop hangouts, board game nights, or casual walks in cool spots 
* Chill conversations about anything and everything 
* Soccer buddy, played back in undergrad
* Hiking partner to check out local trails
* Bonus points if you also get lost in Wikipedia rabbit holes

Of all the places I’ve lived in, this will forever remain my favourite and I wanted to take a moment to recount all the wonderful things I got to experience here.

From the early morning greetings when you’re on a walk, the board room game cafe with the amazing staff and fun selection of games, the all time fav bus #1 ferrying me all around the city, the museums and the art gallery, the friends the city gave me, the little army of Sobeys staff who helped me find my lost debit card when I’d dropped it, the amazing farmers markets down at the Alexander Keith Brewery and the Seaport Market, the food, the love, the light, the snow, the breweries and trivia nights, pay what you can shows at the Neptune Theatre, all the fun little coffee shops, the ferry on a sunny day, the little snow ploughs that shovel the sidewalks during the night - I WILL MISS YOU ALL, and every little thing.

I got to experience so many different cultures and festivals and food while my time here, and throughout have been just blessed to meet the kindest people and the sweetest doggos. Halifax is where I found myself, expressed myself and accepted myself. I hope that I get to return someday. I know there are flaws, and stuff the government needs to fix, but my heart beats for the Maritimes and the resilience it carries and the warmth and love it shows.

Does he not want to be together anymore? He must not like living together? And doesnt see me long term Hed be fine by himself? Im not very important to him? So what am i doing here? I dont bring anything into this for him? He wouldnt have a hard time without me.Thats basically what he said hed be okay if anything happens and we split up. In the moment..i was in shock processing. I didnt know what to say, i looked up at him holding back my tears because initially i was hurt now im just pissed off. he immediately tried to retract it ""i didn't mean it like that"" i couldnt look at him because then id definitely cry. I locked eyes with the elevator door praying for it to open as he goes, ""i just meant id be okay if I had to be on my own again"" so ??yeah just reaffirming what he already said. The Exact the same thing just phrased differently? honestly theres no other way to mean what  he said? He tried to hug on me an in the moment i decided to hug back but started tickling him an clowning on him about it to hide how i really felt i was like ""oh yeah ud be fine without me"" tickling his armpits and neck ""good to know ud be just fine if anything happened"" like playfully i made it into a joke kind of but I was so hurt, as soon as the doors opened i flew down the hallway and the tears just started coming out. I wiped them before he could see, he just met me with a hug once we layed in bed we didnt say anything else about it and that's where it was left. we moved on with the day like nothing happened, but i haven't been able to stop thinking about what he said. I don't understand why he would say that. If we broke up i think if anything he'd be worse off ? Hed have to fly back to his state and live with family. i dont think he meant it financially he has no job hasnt been able to keep a steady one since hes been here, he lives in mine an my moms apartment so rn pays no rent, he would have to pay rent with family. he pays cheap payments on my truck, So we have transportation. In his state has no car. He basically has no finances just Pays a cheap internet bill/ phone bill for himself and a storage payment for his shit in his home state. Plus any credit he owes. If he was on his own he'd be struggling. And I would be too. I don't understand why he said that he'd be okay, but honestly if he feels he'd be okay I'm willing to let him go. im wasting my life with someone who doesn't care nearly as much as I thought, and is more than okay with the thought of being without me that he had to tell me in the elevator.

I had a massive crush on one guy from this circle, and we used to flirt a lot as well. Like, constant teasing (neither of us did it to anyone else in the circle). He was 25 that time.

I lost contact with him as he moved to a different neighborhood, but used to keep thinking about him. In the end of the year, I asked him out for coffee but he didnt reply at all. I thought he was busy (he was not employed at the time). I was too dumb and didnt understand that it meant no.

I embarrassed myself when a couple months later, I joined a hangout where he was also going to be there. It was sort of like a treat which my 2 male friends (who are like elder brothers, both around 30M) made me give because of salary hike at work (it was an ad-hoc plan and I wasnt even sure who all were coming). I was very happy that day... until he (my crush) came up.

He was completely changed towards me. OBVIOUSLY, it's because I had asked him for coffee (which is a very obvious way of showing interest) and that changed the friendship dynamics. Like, he was rude and put me down (in a joking way) in many things. This guy did a complete 180 degrees behavior-wise. If I had known I wouldnt have gone. I didnt say anything out of respect for the 2 bhaiyas. 

Moreover, i think I further offended him by paying for all of us (may be he didnt know that it was my treat beforehand. Like, he was weirded out that she's showing off her salary/ job which I wasnt). He always makes salary jokes

I am so embarassed and in emotional pain thinking about this. I messed up so badly. I was 23 and a kid, I didnt know many things which I do now. Wish I had handled it better.

I had just left cram school and was heading home. Before going back, I thought I'd stop by this small bookstore near my place—maybe the new volume of Berserk had arrived. I figured I could read it with some coffee and shake off this exhaustion.

While browsing the manga section, I noticed volume 6 of Chainsaw Man. I picked it up and started flipping through the pages without even checking the cover. Suddenly, I realized two girls from my cram school were standing next to me, staring at me like I had just committed a crime. One of them gasped, ""Omg, what are you reading?!"" Before I could say anything, the other one straight-up went, ""Are you a perv?"" and they walked away.

I was completely confused, just standing there like, what the hell just happened? I kept looking at the manga, and that’s when I saw it—the cover had a naked picture of Reze. My brain shut down for a second. I immediately put the volume back. Berserk’s new volume wasn’t there either, so I just went home feeling like absolute crap.

I had no idea how bad this was about to get. I went to bed early, hoping to forget about it. But when I woke up, my phone was blowing up with notifications. I checked, and apparently, the whole cram school group chat was talking about me. People were like, ""OMG, he does that kind of stuff?!"" and making fun of me. My DMs were full of people asking if it was true.

At that moment, I just sat there thinking, Welp, I’m screwed. I spammed the chat telling everyone it wasn’t what they thought, but it was already too late. I used the classic ""I'm sick"" excuse and skipped class today.

What do I even do now? Someone please help.

On it, a good thousand men and women await for the train. And when the smoke arrives, all of their legs and arms move closer, to the coming train. The crowd of sweat, coffee and ragged clothes rush inside compartments, filling it quite all overboard. And train, when there is almost no place inside for anyone, closes doors: effectively cutting someone's head, finger, leg or anything of human body that wasn't inside the train. But those who were removed of limbs by the doors wouldn't scream: blood quietly poured off from them. And when the doors were locked, train would emit another gust of this yellow smoke: and with the speed of a bullet, train filled up with blood before being dropped off the rails into an abyss in the tunnels of the metro. Pale yellow lights covered the station...

""The train station anomaly is stable, nothing unusual. Over."" A man in the nicely done yellow hazard office suit, sits at the bench with a big apparatus beside him. Which is a mix of a radio and something that bleeps every five seconds or so.

""Confirmed, the E-wing of the train station is clear too, janitor was killed, killer's look still the same. Over."" A woman in the yellow trench sits at the bench too, but now far away from the station itself. A road of blood trailed over right to the maintenance door, where a large, hulky man in the blue suit would carry a dead, old woman of asian look. The man who carried her, was a man with a swastika etched on his forehead. Between his arm and torso, a simple worker hat was held.

""Tattoo is still there?"" Man asks, looking over all those who were left at the station.

""Yep. Big guy still has it on the same spot. Anyway, the Climax is... Uh... Yeah, five minutes from now, we should leave. Over.""

""Understood, ma'am."" Man presses on the button of his machine and it snatches all together into one compressed piece of metal. It fits good in his pants pocket, and he rubs his hands before yawning. ""Who's that newbie, again?"" He looked at the walking to him woman.

""CIA hard nutshell. One of the best, they told me."" Woman sighed, before she collected her bearings and a while of silence passed with them both. Death was in the air.

""I bet newbie dies tonight.""

""I too...""

""So, mister or missis, I am glad you volunteered for a place here. It's not like in the Agency, Agent. There are no more human targets or beings you could understand. It's a place we control by loose noodles and by a well over million other employees. We need to hold it for whatever it may cost, or it will kill the world. I know you are one of the best out there, or at least one of the brave to sign up for this."" A burned, charred man's voice comes out of the intercom. He smoke a lot. ""Agent. You're in the deep water now. From this point onward, you are no one. Your codename at every operation is going to be Tango, you can use your name only in the Headquarters, but now, your codename will be Tango. Wait for the Instructor Agent here, newbie. And yes, relax."" Intercom ruffles up one last time, before voice and connection are off.

**II.** There's a tale of a King who feared Death... He was the mightiest, bringing down any foe to the ground... From the young age, he was bewildered with his power, his sheer power... He crowned himself, calling oneself a true King of all Lands... And he did conquer all of them. Yet. In the end of his life, where he lied in his bed: one thing he feared the most. Death. It smiled through all the ages, in the form of blades and arrows, in the form of all those foes he brought down. But now it grins with an ultimate avatar: time. All men die, and it is reality. Yet the King was in the terror to think, that all he did, that all he done, was going to be a legacy, a heirloom for his heirs. He did not wanted Death. And in the old age, he started to seek. Everything, from the poisoned brews to the sickening rituals, nothing helped. And when he was in his deathbed, he almost gave in. But the Devil offered him, a chance to live more.

""You shall make your wife a vessel for my Lord."" And King agreed.

That is why, little Cursed One, you wander. That is why we all suffer. For King made whole world immortal, and made men unkillable. Yet the blade could still bring them pain, yet a sickness could kill them. They were immortal in the way worst possible, doomed to live and to die, and to live and to die. It is a duty of every Cursed One to try kill the King. And his Love. His Love is the holder of the curse... And we shall make everything in our way, to reach the King's Throne and make his head fall from his shoulders. So go, Cursed One, make him pay for all the suffering...

HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLOOO. This is my many attempt at trying to find a partner for an adventure of sort. In the first prompt, it's going to be like agent-themed exploration of the Backworld, and like you can guess, its backrooms. Well, its the core of what I want to do, I don't want limit myself on only these both themes.

And in the second prompt, it's the soulsborne in which you need to reach the King and His Wife, to free the world from the curse. We'll have dices, coin flips n all. Not going to use much of DnD mechanics.

I acted like I wanted something more than friendship, yet I was indecisive. Eventually, we lost contact.

Months later, we ran into each other at the gym, exchanged greetings, and he acted friendly toward me. I later texted him, we chatted, and I told him I wanted to grab a coffee. I admitted that I enjoyed spending time with him and wanted to meet again. He said he also had a great time with me back then, but he thought I didn’t want him. We talked for a bit and eventually agreed to meet. But as soon as I started talking, he told me he was in a relationship. This was completely unexpected because he knew why I was there. I had to shift the conversation away from what I initially wanted to discuss, and at that point, opening up about my feelings felt meaningless.

I didn’t understand why he agreed to meet me in the first place, but after that day, I completely cut off contact. After that, I actively avoided him at the gym—I ignored him and avoided any interaction.

However, two months ago, while I was working out on a machine ,he approached me at the gym and started a long conversation. Then, yesterday, he texted me out of nowhere, asking how I was doing.

**Some context:**  I fully acknowledge that I was inconsistent in the past—I didn’t know what I wanted. But that doesn’t justify giving mixed signals. I reflected a lot on my actions, which is why I wanted to meet him. I’ve never acted this confusing toward someone before. I guess when you become self-aware and realize you may have treated someone unfairly, **you experience deep regret.** We never even had a relationship, but I still wonder how things would have been if we had.

I’m open to criticism, but please be constructive—I already know where I went wrong. **Now that he’s texting me again, do you think he’s just being friendly, or could there be something more behind it?** 

Have you ever been in a situation where you realized what you wanted too late? How did you handle it?",2,1741582724.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1j7r0bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1j7r0bb/this_tiny_italian_island_bans_tourists_and_its/,"🗺️❌ ""This Tiny Italian Island Bans Tourists (And It's AMAZING)""","Hey, fellow wanderlusters! So, I recently stumbled upon something truly unexpected during my travels, and I just had to share it with you all. Picture this: a tiny, picturesque Italian island that decided to do something pretty radical—ban tourists. Crazy, right? But let me tell you, this place is a slice of paradise that you’ll definitely want to hear about.

### 🌊 No Tourists, No Problem

First off, you might be wondering why an island would want to turn away tourists. With overtourism impacting many global hotspots, this little gem opted for a different route—protection over profit. By limiting foot traffic, the island’s natural beauty and charming culture have been preserved, creating an authentic Italian experience that's increasingly rare to find.

### 🎨 Authentic Beauty & Culture

When I reached the island, the first thing that struck me was its untouched charm. Think cobblestone streets, ancient ruins, and vibrant local markets where you’re more likely to share a coffee with the shop owner than battle crowds. Everything about it screams authentic Italy, from the traditional Trattorias to the breathtaking coastlines.

### 🌿 Connecting with the Locals

One of the most rewarding aspects of visiting was the genuine connections I made with the locals. Because tourism isn’t their mainstay, islanders are incredibly welcoming. They’re eager to share stories, teach you how to cook their grandmother’s secret pasta recipe, or invite you to join in local festivals. It's travel experiences like this that truly feed the soul.

### 🔍 Navigation Tips

If you’re keen on seeing places like this, here's a few tips:

- **Research Ahead**: Dig into local forums or niche travel blogs that focus on authentic experiences.
- **Go Off-Peak**: You’ll find it easier to blend in with locals and enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere.
- **Respect the Culture**: Be mindful of the customs and traditions. Remember, we are visitors, not intruders.

### ✈️ Think Smaller, Travel Better

This island experience truly changed the way I perceive travel. It’s not always about ticking off the top attractions; sometimes, the smaller, less-explored paths offer the richest stories.

It was a fantastic story, most of the characters were really likeable, and even though I had a few close calls, I had a pretty good time getting through all the fights.

But there's just one major shortcoming that I gotta get off my chest.  One flaw that stands out even more sharply in contrast with the rest of the game. *Where's the rest of Kuneko's story?!*  Let me tell ya, Barkley isn't staying in the doghouse, *Felix is*, because he scared off the poor adorable little cinnamon roll.  Not only can you not recruit her as a party member, you can't:

* Have conversations over coffee
* Give them a great big hug and tell them that everything will be alright.
* Have any other interaction other than fighting them and one-sidedly destroying them like the overpowered cassette goblin that you are.
* Even give them build advice to help them grow as a warrior.

It's so endlessly tragic every time I see the poor kitty ninja out in the world.  I just want to give her a big box of Random Starter or AP Refund stickers or something.  So I had to take it upon myself to add something more to this tale.

Ive had anxiety and depression since I was in middle school, Ive had a few panic attacks through the years but managed and learned to ""act normal"" whenever I have these attacks. Tbh with all the shxt Ive experienced so far, Ive learned how to suck it up and live with it. Like, yes I want to k!ll my self but we're chill. We dont want our neighbors to smell our dec0mposing body so were chilling. I've forced myself to find a purpose but I have to admit most of the time my other self often comes out--the other me who thinks Im worthless and will not be able to get through the shxt. Im the typical, ""he looks depressed and miserable but thats just his personality. He's chill af, he can k!ll you and himself but he wont"" type of thing ( someone told me this ) Specially this past few days, bc my boss is shxtty as fvck, he whines and blames you for the shxt that he do but I cant resign because I hear people around me saying Im just impatient and ""always"" unsatisfied. So even if Im just working at home, I always feel like Im dragging myself to work and I physically feel the anxiety in my body now. I cant sleep, even when I do I feel like Im always tired. My stomach is killing me and my knees and fingers jerks like theres a fckng parasite moving them. I make a lot of mistakes because I cant focus. I also decided to go back to school this year as part of me finding a purpose, but shxt is just not working at all. Ive tried looking for a different job but I couldnt find something that I know would work for me. And I honestly also dont want to resign because of the anxiety because I dont want to get used to running away and making myself think I can just quit if things gets rough but this is just hurting so much and I dont know what to do anymore. Ive never actually break down in front of anyone just silently dealing with the voices in my head while sipping a cup of coffee somewhere but I gradually find myself just losing it these past few days. Sometimes I just stop working and wouldnt even notice Ive stopped moving for hours and it would affect my work then affect me more since I have to catch up my deadlines. I know for a fact that if I dont do anything, one of these days Id just dunk somewhere and people wouldnt even know and I really dont want that to happen.",2,1741582196.0,depression_help,3,1.0,False

 It was 9 in the morning when they left. I bid them bye, did some chores and then took a look at my phone. I haven't texted her since yesterday. So, I started texting her. A simple ""Heyyyy!"".  
  
 Luckily, she was online at that moment. She responds with a ""heyyyyyyy!!!!"".  
  
 I tell her that I'm all alone today (probably 200th time in this month).  
  
 She replies, ""I know dumbass, you've been telling me about this the whole month"".  
  
 I was bored, so I texted her to come over to my house though I meant it in a sarcastic way.  
  
 She replies, ""In 10 minutes"".  
  
 We were ""friends"" for 2 years by that point. Very close to say the least. As you might've guessed, I have a serious crush on her but was never able to confess it due to my past bad experiences. We used to flirt , but it was never serious and seemed common just like other close ""friends"" do. Though I really liked her, I feared losing her in case she decides to leave me if I confess..  
  
 I come back to my senses and look at my phone. ""In 10 minutes"", I saw that message again.  
  
 I was damn sure she was joking. I replied with a laughing emoji. There were only double ticks though. No blue ticks.  
  
 I keep my phone aside and start cleaning my room. And then, ""Tring Tring!!"" rang the doorbell. I had no package deliveries scheduled nor the watchman was in the apartment .  
  
 I went to the gate and stood in shock for a minute. It was her. She was wearing a clean white top with contrasting loose black jeans. She was drop dead gorgeous. No no, she is ALWAYS drop dead gorgeous.  
  
 She asks, ""Are you gonna stand there forever?"". Asking me to open the gate. I come back to my senses. I opened the gate and let her in..   
  
I was short of words to be honest. But I manage to mumble a few words, ""I.. I was just... joking around.. Didn't expect you.... to really come over"".  
  
 She replies, ""So, am I not welcome? Shall I leave?"" she sounded witty, her voice cute as ever.. I stumble again, ""No.. No.. I didn't mean that.. It is so nice of you... to come over"".  
  
 ""Stop this and bring me something to eat. I had a little breakfast"" she says, sitting on the sofa.  
  
 I run to the kitchen and in a span of 15 minutes, prepare PB&J sandwiches with a side of hot coffee.  
  
 I bring them to her and she starts eating the sandwiches. The way she cleans herself when a tiny bit of bread falls on her black jeans was too cute. And by this point, I found her cute in everything she did. I could sit with her and watch her for hours, if not days without even uttering a word.  
  
 She finishes eating her sandwiches and starts drinking her coffee slowly. She offered me some but I already had my breakfast so I refused.  
  
 I thank her again for coming over at such a short notice.  
  
 She then glares at me and says , ""Oh! Stop thanking me asshole! Who the fuck thanks their girlfriend these many times for coming over? Are you mad?"" in a loud voice.  
  
 I froze. I froze for a minute. I couldn't exactly focus. I recollect what she said and realize, this girl proposed to me and is calling herself my ""girlfriend"". Millions of thoughts rush my mind.  
  
 I ask her, stumbling at every word, ""Did.. you.. j-just.. propose to me?"".  
  
""Yes you dumbass. I can't be more straightforward than this"".   
  
I come into my senses, think for a bit and reply, ""see, i do accept i have a crush on you but entering into a relationship...."" I pause.   
  
""What?""   
  
""You see, I'm scared. You know my past and how I was abandoned. I fear if that happens again....."".   
  
Before I complete the sentence, she leans over and kisses me. Her soft, tender lips touch mine, not making me talk anymore. I don't refuse it. In fact, I wanted it.  
  
 Her kiss wasn't ""let's have some fun now"" type. It was a sign of assurance. She was assuring me that she wouldn't leave me in this lifetime, so I got my answer. I am deeply in love with this girl and I will never let her go, come what may..

5'10"" 135 pounds. I have a standing desk and use a treadmill at a lowish speed for about 6 hours per day, 5 days a week. I do admit, I eat a lot of sugar (chocolate), no sugared sodas, and sometimes I am so busy I forget to drink water and about 3 days of the week I do feel dehydrated. I consume very low salt (Na level was 136). I drink 1 glass of wine about 5-7 nights per week. I do have cloudy urine (no odor) about 5 times a week (but usually only 1-2 times per day on those 5 days a week).

My PCP recommended I drink less caffeine to see if it helps (previously drinking 1 cup of drip coffee in AM and 1 teaspoon of matcha powder in my daily AM shake, that's it).  If the symptoms did not improve then go in for labs. After reducing matcha powder down to 1 teaspoon and waiting about 1 month I do think it helped some but not enough. So I went in for labs.  
  
She ordered CMP, PSA and UA.  
CMP WNL. A1C 5.1.   
PSA 0.62. UA: no bacteria, pH 8, cloudy, WBC 0-2,  RBC/HPF 6-10, and UA Hgb 0-6.

On the day of my test my urine did not appear cloudy to me. 

My follow up appointment is a bit out, so I would rather send her a message to get medication prescribed.  She originally mentioned she would refer me to urology but I am not sure if that is still her plan. I believe I might have a kidney stone that I am trying to pass but no symptoms or early stage of BPH with combination of dehydration and early stages of BPH.   
  
I am thinking of asking for tamsulosin and/or daily tadalafil.    
  
Thoughts?

To rule out a kidney stone, is some sort imaging required or is it safe to simply start tamsulosin? 

Does a circumcised vs uncircumcised penis have anything to do with this?

Every day I wake up thankful for this beautiful life I live. I love my job (and I make good money which is nice lol) and am in grad school part time on the side. I am married to the love of my life and have adorable cats. The small details like the way the trees sway in the breeze or when my coffee is made well make me smile. When you spend so long wanting to die, it gives you perspective on how beautiful the miracle of life is. I'm so glad that I stuck it out. You can't always see what your path holds for you around the corner.

It was a journey. I failed out of 12 meds, including sleep meds and had all kinds of horrible reactions to meds from getting suicidal, horrible nausea and vomiting to the point where I lost 15 pounds in a month because I couldn't eat, intense brain fog and word recall issues to the point where I couldn't always form sentences, and feeling horribly dazed to the point that people thought I was drunk. Then there was the time I had a potential allergic reaction to a med and my eye swelled up. I've had doctors who told me I had to live with these side effects or that I couldn't expect to work, have a good life, and that I'd have to adjust to that. I'm glad that I never stopped fighting for the life I wanted to live even when people told we that wasn't possible.

Since many of you will wonder, here is my med routine:

With first meal: 200mg lamotrigine, 12.5mg lithium orotate (Weyland brand), multivitamin (Olly brand), NAC (to be nice to my kidneys due to the lithium and for hormonal issues) and fish oil if I remember

About 3-4 hours before bed: 200mg magnesium glycinate (sleep), 3mg melatonin, 200mg DIM (sleep, acne, and estrogen hormonal imbalance). I also like to drink some sleep tea or relaxing tea starting about now.

If I'm not sleepy yet, 0.2mg clonidine about a half hour before bed. I take this for sleep because traditional sleep meds give me problems.

Uless specified I use the NOW brand for supplements. They are a bit pricey, but worth it. I find that I'm able to take lower doses of their brands compared to others and it works better. Also, ladies if you have a hard time sleeping, especially close to your period you should explore where you have an estrogen imbalance. Anyways, don't give up people.

When told him I felt the same, he said he couldn’t give me what I need and tried to set me up with other guys. What gives?","Last year he told our friends he was interested in me. As in, end of 2023 last year. For months he was flirting, very jealous, overprotective, nervous, chivalrous and kind. He brought me my morning coffee and held doors open for me. Last month I told him I was attracted to him, and he started acting weird. Anxious and attracted but also…mad? He started avoiding me. He would give me these longing stares, then would pretend to be busy. He would check me out, but turn away when we made eye contact. He also was acting suspicious of me. A week after being flirty and giving me little gifts, he told me that he can’t be the guy I need and that I deserve to be happy. 

I didn’t say I needed or even wanted anything.

He started looking relieved when other men flirted with me, but then would immediately scrutinize my reaction. He still stared longingly at me, but refused to speak to me at all. It was like he pushed me away as soon as I reciprocated. He seemed conflicted, idk how to explain it other than he was suspicious of me and attracted to me and pushing away at the same time. Like he was relieved I wasn’t pursuing him but was still interested. That was very much his vibe. He would give me big dopey smiles, get anxious, and run away.

This went on for a month- all of February. Then I found out today that he’s been hooking up with a friend of mine for a week. He had never even spoken to my friend in the year I’ve known him. He always ignored them to flirt with me. But now, all of a sudden, they’re hooking up. He doesn’t know that I know.

I’m devastated. I thought maybe he just needed space. I had been been trying not to flirt or even talk to him since he told me I deserve better- I wanted to respect his boundaries. But instead he did the one thing that would hurt me the most. Out of all the people in the city, all of a sudden he just has to hook up with my friend?? It’s like he’s pouring gasoline on our relationship and lighting it on fire. He’s not burning the bridge, he’s bombing it. 

The worst part is, I suspected his female best friend had had feelings for him when he and I started talking last year. They were attached at the hip, everyone thought they had at least hooked up, but he had a girlfriend. The best friend and I became close, and he started talking with me right after he broke up with his girlfriend. (His girlfriend was his FWB for awhile after, they had an on and off relationship for five years.) He told his best friend he had feelings for me- she told me this, and that’s how I know he really was interested- then she cut us both off shortly after that. I was the random friend. And now he’s friendzoning me for my friend. After telling people he was into me for a full year. In one week, his feelings supposedly changed. And the shitty thing is, I know they didn’t. I know he’s running. I know he’s sabotaging. I know he will blame me if I can’t be around him after this- it will be proof that 1. I don’t care about him, just what I want from him, 2. I was always going to leave anyway.

My mind is spinning. I’m an avoidant myself, but this is on another level. I care for him deeply, and I know he cares for me too, he just…he’s destroying every chance he has. I can’t be his friend, not really. I have feelings for him. I don’t know what to do.",0,1741581292.0,attachment_theory,12,0.5,False

Story is years old.

Had three reservations come in for QQ. We’ve been sold out of that room type for a couple of days. I’m about to hand off the desk to my co-worker when she notices that we’re oversold and starts making the call to the third party.

> ""We’ve been sold out of these room types for a few days and cannot accommodate these reservations. Please call your guests and make other arrangements for them. We have K’s with pull-out sofas, or they need to choose a different property.""



The agent agrees to contact ""our mutual guest"" and take care of them.

A few hours later, the guests all arrive (apparently, they were part of a family), and they already know about the King/Double Queen issue. And they agree to check in.

Today, I get a call from the third-party site, and they want me to compensate the guests in some way for not having the room types they booked.

Bitch, please. You are the ones who oversold us. We informed you ahead of time. You even told the guests about the issue, they chose to stay here anyway, and now you want us to comp them?

GTFO with that noise and get off my damn phone.

Maybe I should have, ""...Well I have some complimentary shampoo bottles I could give them for the inconvenience of having to accept the room that they agreed to accept."" Hell I've got tons of freebies! Shower caps, razors, even coffee packets!

## Potential Drawbacks and Concerns

Despite its numerous advantages, the Hydro Flask standard Flex Straw Cap (Goji, 24oz) isn't without its drawbacks:

*   **Price:** Hydro Flasks are relatively expensive compared to other water bottles. This can be a barrier to entry for some consumers. Keep an eye out for hydro flask discounts and hydro flask sale events.
*   **Maintenance:** while generally easy to clean, the straw and cap can be prone to mold or bacteria buildup if not cleaned regularly and properly. This requires consistent effort and attention.
*   **Weight:** Stainless steel bottles like the Hydro Flask can be heavier than plastic alternatives, especially when filled.

*   **Noise:** The straw can sometimes make a slight sucking noise when drinking, which might be distracting to some users or those around them.
*   **Not Ideal for Hot liquids (with Straw Cap):** While the bottle itself can handle hot liquids, the straw cap isn't always the best choice for hot beverages, as the straw material might not be as heat-resistant and can potentially warp or degrade over time. For hot liquids, a solid cap is generally recommended.
*   **Counterfeit Products:** Due to its popularity, the Hydro Flask is frequently enough targeted by counterfeiters. Consumers need to be vigilant when buying online, especially on platforms with less stringent seller verification, to ensure they are purchasing an authentic product. Always buy hydro flask online from reputable sources, or from the hydro flask official website when possible.[[Explore Top Rated hydro flask standard flex straw cap goji 24 oz on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/hidratespark/?kw=hydro flask standard flex straw cap goji 24 oz)

If price is not a major concern, and you value the Hydro Flask's reputation and aesthetic, then it is likely worth the investment. It is indeed also one of the best water bottle with straw options available.

However, if you are on a budget, or if you are primarily concerned with having the lightest possible water bottle, then there are certainly compelling alternatives that offer similar functionality at a lower price or with a lighter weight.

All our local creeks are up so we’re flooded in and running low on coffee and patience. Need some help to settle a dispute and distract us please. 

This morning during a particularly heavy downpour I remarked to my husband that it was absolutely bucketing down. To which he replied - nope, it’s more than bucketing, it’s bloody pissing down. And a debate ensued.

So I’m pretty certain that bucketing is heavier than pissing. I mean there’s an unofficial but generally accepted scale and bucketing is the heaviest. Right??
Plus I’m a nurse so I do know a thing or two about pissing (re volume and velocity etc). But my husband is a pilot so he thinks he knows ~~everything~~ stuff about weather.  Yeah so that’s where we’re at.

I’m arguing the scale goes like this:

1. Smells like/feels like rain
2. Drop or two/few drops here and there
3. Spitting
4. Drizzling
5. Shower
6. Rain
7. Pouring rain 
8. Pissing down
9. Bucketing 
10. Biblical (torrential and relentless)

He says that ‘spitting’ is unnecessary because it’s not different enough from a few drops to warrant a separate entry. 
And also that pissing is heaps heavier than bucketing so those two need to be swapped. 

Thoughts?

I’ve been looking for a job since January 2023 and I have not found anything yet. I was working in IT support but my last contract ended and I had only interviewed for a few jobs throughout 2023 with no luck… 
But for the past year I have just been applying to any type of job to do something and get a paycheck… I just keep striking out even if it’s a coffee barista or host at a restaurant… this is ridiculous. I finished college almost 20 years ago. I have a bachelors degree. I have over five years of management experience in a retail environment, and I can’t even get an entry-level job. It takes a large toll on you mentally to go this long without work… I just need anything to stop the drowning. I can look for better jobs once I find anything for the time being",2,1741580305.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

Hey all! I’m thinking about starting a coffee club, not sure if there’s something like this already but Id need at least four more people to help make it official! This club is not just about coffee, it’s about building a fun little community where people can hang out, make friends, and bond over a common hobby. Think of it as grabbing a drink with friends and catching up on life.

Whether you’re a barista, a homebrew pro, or just someone who loves grabbing an iced latte, matcha or redbull and chatting, this is for you! We’ll do things like:
✨ Taste-testing new drinks
🫧 Studying with friends
✨ Recreating some espresso stand favorites
🫧 Baking and sweet treats
✨ Just hanging out & making friends

I’m still in the process of setting everything up, so if this sounds like your vibe, let me know! Once we get four people, we can officially make this a club. Drop a comment, DM me, or email wwucoffeeclub@outlook.com to join! ☕✨",15,1741580266.0,WWU,4,1.0,False

I always have had been a hopeless romantic person who always imagined how he will do this and that for his partner but i sadly never had any partner and now cuz of my social anxiety I don't talk much with people as well.

I just wanted to say this to that someone i never met cuz I just had my heart filled with all these things so wanted to say it loud. I would have made you feel heard in true sense, i would have been there for u whenever u would want, pampered u in whatever way I could. I would have tried to understand you and how u feel cuz i know in today's world the thing that is missing is someone understanding us. 

 I would love to spend time with you, make good food for you and suggest you on how u could improve in life. I would make sure your every moment with spend with me is special and heartwarming. Since I can cook I would bake heart shaped cake for you. Make nice coffee as well so that we can talk while having it. And ik it can be hard on somedays for women, I promise to care and be with u when in that zone where u are very vulnerable especially during periods.

I never was able to say these things but since im a hopeless romantic person I used to journal these things but thought of sharing this thing as i never had anyone to share my thoughts with. Thanks for reading!.",8,1741580245.0,OffMyChestIndia,5,0.83,False

However, with that, I find myself solo at home with my daughter A LOT. Again, SUPER grateful for that. But, I’m ready to “get my pink back!” I feel like I’m beginning to get the hang of this mom thing.. (well just accepting the fact that literally everyday is going to look different and to roll with the punches at this point 🤪) so I’m ready to slowly start incorporating some “me” back into our day. 

While I appreciate my husband tagging in while I shower and the occasional 30 minute break, so I can go pick up food for us somewhere that’s just not cutting it anymore.

What are you doing to “Get your pink back” with a LO at home that loves to contact nap during the day? 

Edited to add: I don’t feel like I have any “hobbies”, but pre baby, I read a lot, worked out at least 3 days a week, and had coffee dates with coworkers a few times a month and that filled my cup 🤍",1,1741580053.0,NewParents,2,1.0,False
