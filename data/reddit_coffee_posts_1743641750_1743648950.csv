I am miffed.  I spent 2.5 miserable years putting lpr into remission. I thought I was “cured”. Did it all.  Threw the kitchen sink at it.  Low acid diet, PPI, h2, bed so high it was like a damn slide.  50 different supplements.  Carnivore diet.  Cymbalta etc etc.  I praised my work on the vagus nerve to move forward to normalcy.  Even wrote a success story here.  Jokes on me. 

It’s back in rage as of Feb of this year.  Why?   Why?  Why?  

I’m 41. Male.  Healthy considering my chronic conditions.  

With all these symptoms that creep back in and are atrocious, does anyone ever feel - like fuck it all.  If I’m going to be in pain, I might as well eat and drink what the fuck I want.  

I worked so hard for a career and now I’m about to be let go because I can barely speak. A career that is lucrative and sits it the top 3 percent income wise.  Have a nice retirement set up.  Divorced because of this shit as x wife thinks I was mad/crazy.  Even tho I showed her so many posts on fb and Reddit.  Does not matter - we are still friends and co parent a 10 year old. 

If it was not for this, I’d cash out, get on disability (I have bi polar and hbv) live in a cheap studio, and just drink booze and eat whatever the fuck I want.  Get fat, who cares as I have no life.  Just trying to find cures that require so much of each day to eat shit food and walk around at night waiting for 5 hours to pass to lay down after eating some baked chicken and peas or whatever else is shit.   

I’m about an inch away from this.  Definitely doing it once daughter turns 18.  

Just ranting.  This disease sucks. 

Anyone want to join me?  More people cheaper the rent.   ESP if we move to like North Dakota or some cheap ass state.  

40s and pizza, wings, coffee, milkshakes.  

Most of us feel like shit each day and not living a life trying to tame this stupid beast.  

Just ranting as can’t believe this shit is back and have no idea when it will creep on and now just full of stress and anxiety that even if I subside the symptoms, the evil henchman will be back.  Thank god I got this shit in an oldish age.  Sorry to young people. I’d take out credit cards and travel the world eating what I want and deal with the pain.  I have yet to meet one person that has successfully tamed this long term and I’ve talked to a lot of ppl off forums.  Flat out asked ents and gis to give my email to patients with lpr. Not one soul. 

Who’s ready. Fuck the sore throats, globus, mucus, burning eyes, nose on fire, breath smells like an infant shat in my mouth, sinus headaches, loss of speech or painful to speak, throat clearing, coughing like the plague, jaw pain, tonsil stones, ear pain, breathing through quicksand, what am I missing. 

This is seriously my next step in life ….

1jq7g9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1jq7g9v/always_leave_on_a_full_battery/,Always. Leave. On A FULL Battery.,"On my way to the gym, I saw two women (one of them carrying some sort of box), then I asked her if she needed help carrying the box; well, she said that she's okay and she's good. I was about to walk to their car and...same thing happened when I told one of the ladies that I was going to open the door for them. Instead of forcing it on them, I remained reserved and took the rejection for granted. (Fun fact: the same thing happened when my therapist was going to pay for both of our lattes; I told her that I got this, I was going to do the buying...she told me it's her treat, but she did pay for both of ours regardless...but she told me next time it will be my treat. Funny thing is that I was the one who initiated the whole Rosebud Coffee thing. Not her.)

I went to the gym, did 10 push-ups, 10 sit-ups, that's it, no other exercises; I left immediately because I realized my phone was going to die. I forgot to charge it while I was asleep before I even woke up and did my therapy thing. I went to shop at Whole Foods, bought as many as 30 items for a whopping $126.70 (on my EBT food stamps ALONE) plus $13.14 on my debit card. THAT'S WHOLE FOODS FOR YA. Haha, and I got three PAPER bags (again, Whole Foods...they are so pretentious and performative about their ""environmental consciousness""...they can't even sell me a PLASTIC bag even though that's the sort of thing that I like). Anyways, so I got rid of one because there was no room for carrying all the rather ""imbalance"" in my two paper bags, and both of them RIPPED. I ended up putting some things in my sweater (luckily I wore one), and I put a WHOLE bunch of other things in the other bag, which ended up being ripped TOO. I waited, walked around back and forth to grab my things, until a man in his bike had carried two bags with him. Full disclosure, I DID NOT ask or beg for a bag... anyways so he emptied one of them for me, even HE couldn't stand that WF had only paper bags to sell. Luckily he gave me one of his bags. It was still quite a struggle for me to carry all that stuff home.

I could have left ALL of my stuff in the grass for some people to take home, only to have a certain gas station or fast food employee call my mom to pick me up. But, I didn't want to. Because I had no bags. Until now. I thought eating the two sandwiches from a Whole Foods container and guzzling a full gallon of iced tea would have saved my day and my space. It didn't really.

I was waiting to see if a police car would come so I could beg an officer to pick me up and carry all my stuff. But I changed my mind and did not want them to worry about me just talking to police for no reason. I wanted to see if a taxi could come by, but outside of Vegas, apparently it is a crime for a taxi cab to stop at random places out of nowhere. I did not trust the bus to have me carry all my 20+ items with me without having at least two bags. I was about to go with Metro Micro, but it was not available. I was trying to have an Uber pick me up, but my phone died immediately after. But, this guy Sean (or Shaun?) ...man, did he save my life!!! I asked how often he bikes around here, he told me not often. I told him, next time I see him, I will return the bag to him. He told me to keep the bag. However, based on how I was raised, I am still heavily in favor of returning things in favor.

TL;DR: I taught my-very-self a lesson... ALWAYS leave the house on a full smartphone battery. NEVER leave, and especially don't shop from far away, on an empty battery.",1,1743648727.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

We have been at CPA over a dozen times since it opened. During the 1st intermission we went looking g to get a hot coffee and to our surprise we couldn’t find any where to get one. Starbucks does have quite the presence as a founding sponsor, including a Starbucks Market. But what is sold there is the same grab and go drinks and snacks you get at any of the other vendors in the concourse. I know that the club sections have free coffee available for the gentry, but on Monday we were just sitting in gen pop with the rest of the animals. I even asked the folks at the information booth in the concourse, and they were flummoxed as well.

1jq7fa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jq7fa4/new_to_bartter_syndrome_and_feeling_lost/,New to Bartter Syndrome and feeling lost,"In late October I (27F) found out I had critically low potassium (2.6 mmol/L). Went to the ER and long story short I’ve been on potassium chloride supplements ever since. After much trial and error, we landed on 80 mEq of potassium chloride and finally got me back up to normal levels of potassium in my blood (3.4 mmol/L as of  January 22nd). A few weeks later I got back RENASIGHT results and found out I have Bartter Syndrome Type 3….

And then I started to feel symptoms of low potassium return (nausea, headaches, fatigue, intense back pain/cramping, little muscle cramps in my legs and arms). I asked my PCP to test and sure enough it was back down at 3.1 mmol/L on March 14th. They increased my potassium chloride dosage to 100 mEq (50 mEq in the morning and 50 at night. Tested again on March 31st and it’s only at 3.2 mmol/L. 

Now my PCP is having me take 120 mEq/day (40 mEq, 3 times a day) and said it’s possible we may need to make it 140 mEq. Yesterday was my first day on 120 and it felt easier on my stomach than taking 50 mEq at a time but TODAY 😵‍💫😵‍💫 I feel like I am perpetually queasy now :/ it’s like a combo of nausea and hollowness that almost feels like depression or anxiety?? I know that’s a wild description but I feel so off.

I have a nephrology appointment on April 16th and then another with a doctor that specializes in genetic kidney conditions in late July. After I was scheduled for the second appointment it occurred to me that the one on the 16th might not make anything clearer or easier. 

ANYWAY, I will list my prescriptions etc below, but MY QUESTIONS ARE: 

- With Bartter Syndrome type 3, am I going to experience periodic crashes in potassium? How quickly can this happen and what can trigger it? 

- Is there a way to make this supplementation process less dreadful? I basically couldn’t tolerate the potassium IV they gave me in the ER. I have a pretty high pain tolerance in general, but it felt like my arm was being amputated with fire. 

- Is something like spironolactone next? And if so, is that something I can anticipate from the April 16th appointment?  

- Will I deplete potassium faster if I engage in rigorous exercise? 


Diagnoses: 

Bartter Syndrome 
Oral Allergy Syndrome 
ADHD 
Depression 
Anxiety


Prescriptions: 

1 Zyrtec nightly 
1 elderberry capsule nightly 
125 mg of lamotrigine nightly 

20 mg Adderall daily 
20 mg citalopram daily (30 mg in the days leading up to my period) 

and then of course 40 mEq potassium chloride, three times per day 


Other habits: 

I frequently have two little scoops of collagen powder in my smoothie. Never more than that in a single day. 

I smoke weed daily. 

I do not drink coffee. I will have tea on occasion (maybe twice a month max) and I probably have a caffeinated soda once a week. 

I’m eating at least 80 g of protein each day and im not tracking potassium but I’m trying my best (bananas, prunes, salmon, kale, brocolli, kefir, sweet potatoes, etc). 

As of right now, im not doing any rigorous exercise. When I first found out about the low potassium and started seeing a nutritionist she said that exercising with such low levels would do damage to my heart (I had stopped going to exercise classes bc of the symptoms I was having from low potassium. I didn’t know the cause, but it didn’t feel safe and she said that was the absolute right choice). Now I just feel scared to exercise at a high level.

Introduction: How we met. How we started. 

---

December 2023

—-


Ella and I met in rehab. I’m an alcoholic; she was a heavy drug user. Total opposites on paper. I’m a clean-cut, easygoing IT sales guy—charming, polished. She was a tattooed, spunky ex-raver. Loud. Electric. A proper session head back in the day. If we hadn’t met in that room, our worlds never would’ve crossed. But somehow, we did—and I’ve never been more grateful for that one-in-a-million chance.

She spotted me first in the home room. She still remembers what I was wearing: black hoodie, shorts, cap, and (in her words) my “big aul Hollywood smile.” I noticed her too. She had two tissues jammed up her nose from her last coke-fueled binge, and still, I was drawn to her. She was loud. Laughed a lot. But beneath it all, I saw the sadness in her eyes. Something real.

I was hooked from the very first conversation.

Part 1: The Breakup. Her redemption. My deception. 

-

This is several months later. May 2024.


We broke up because both of us had a foot out the door. I was closing off. Ella was becoming more erratic. She never brings up anything from before the breakup because she recognises we were both newly sober, traumatised people who had no idea what we wanted. She knows what she did was wrong—talking to a guy in America she’d known for a long time. She hid it. She knew it was emotional cheating and fully accepts that it pushed us toward our first big fallout. She went back to old habits—seeking validation, wanting to feel wanted. Dating sites. I found out through a friend and broke up with her.

She spiralled. Nearly relapsed. Made choices that would’ve led her there. She ended up at her ex’s house—someone who used to be a heavy dealer and generally a shitty person. Ironically, he was sober and was the one who urged her to make things right. That didn’t excuse what she did, but she realised that the pain of hurting me was worse than the comfort of old habits.

She went to A&E and asked for every bit of help she could get. Told her friends, her family, her adopted family. She never once asked me not to tell anyone—she let herself be held accountable. Her own mum told her, straight up, that what she did was horrible and it was on her to change. And even then, she asked everyone around her to look out for me. She told her mum directly, “Be the mum you couldn’t be to me, to him.”

I went to A&E with her—but that was it. I thought being there was enough. I thought I’d done my job.

Throughout the whole breakup, she was honest. No matter how she was feeling, she told me. She was determined to be better—for herself, and for me. She went to therapy. Did an outpatient program for two weeks, then kept going to weekly sessions, both online and in person. After the outpatient part ended, she started looking into aftercare because she knew how close she had come to relapsing. She asked only one thing: if we were going to see other people, to be honest about it. Out of respect. She told me if I wanted to date someone else or sleep with someone else, she’d back off. She repeated that over and over. Gave me so many chances to be honest.

And I lied. 

Part 2: First Relapse. Grief and Relapse. 

I was sober too, at the time. But I hid everything. We were still sleeping with each other when I started seeing Lauren. I lied to two people at once. Manipulated both. Out of fear. Fear of being alone. I prioritised my temporary comfort over how Mel would feel, even after we had promised “no more lies.” Did I work on myself? No. I tried to shag my way out of my feelings. I wasn’t honest with my therapist. Or my friends. Or Mel. Not even with myself.

We saw each other twice at her adoptive dad’s house before things really started to unravel again. She slipped into old, shitty habits. Downloaded a dating app after I told her I wasn’t romantically interested anymore. But she deleted it almost immediately and told me, because we had agreed to be honest. And still, I was annoyed. To the point where she was apologising to me—for downloading a dating app—while I was literally dating and sleeping with someone else.

Then her great-grandmother died. The one who raised her when she was young. She was heartbroken. She could have visited a few weeks before, but she skipped the chance to start therapy. She chose to work on herself instead. I read the messages I sent her during that time and I couldn’t have been less supportive, even when I was trying to be. I was on holiday with Lindsey.

When Ella landed in Romania, it was late. The funeral was the next day. She could tell just from how I was texting that I had been drinking. I was with Lindsey in a bar. I turned off my phone and kept drinking. When I woke up the next day, I didn’t even apologise.

She had stayed awake all night—grieving, anxious, worried about me—just in case I replied. She took time out of the funeral to call me and check on me. Her mum even called me, asking if I was okay, offering to bring me to Romania. They put aside their grief and prioritised me and my relapse.

Looking back at the messages, I didn’t ask her once how she was feeling. I didn’t tell her about Lindsey.

Around then, she started having hormone issues that were getting worse. Doctors didn’t have answers. Test after test. She was constantly tired, freezing cold, foggy. Each blood test came back worse. The appointment with the endocrinologist felt like it was never going to come.

Still, she went to her aftercare. She actually went to two—one full-time, one part-time. And she was honest in all of them. She told people how she hurt me. How she wanted to change. To stay sober. I couldn’t see that.

I broke things off with Lindsey on the last day  of my holiday to try again with Ella. We had a long talk about what we wanted for the future and with each other. We promised openness, honesty, transparency. We said we were going to take this relationship seriously. And for a while, it felt like we meant it.

Then she found out about Lindsey. Three weeks later. I’d deleted an entire chat with a friend. Lied about it—said I was just badmouthing Mel to her which is why I deleted it but she knew something was off. Restored the chat. Found out.

She had every right to be upset. I was defensive. Minimized everything. Blamed her. Brought up what she’d done in the past, ignoring the fact that she was actively working on herself now. That we had turned a new leaf. That we promised to be honest. I hurt her in the exact way she had begged me not to—by lying, by being with another woman. Even though we were broken up, we were still emotionally involved. Still sleeping together. All I had to do was say, “Hey, I want to date other people for a while.” But I didn’t.

The trust broke again. Even though Ella’s spirals had gotten better, the insecurity came flooding back. She lashed out. Got distant. Didn’t know if she could be with me. For 2–3 weeks, she couldn’t decide.

I buried my feelings. Thought, “I forgot about Lindsey easily, why can’t Ella?”

Then she hurt her back. An old injury turned serious. Bulged disc pressing on a nerve. She used to be very active. The gym gave her purpose. Suddenly, that was gone too.


Part 3: Bali. The holiday that broke her. 

Then came Bali. She asked me not to go—for my sobriety. For her doubts about my loyalty, especially in a holiday destination. Because of the wound I left when she found out about Lauren while I was off on another holiday. Her mum was worried too. Tried to talk to me.

I put my foot down. She tried to compromise. “What if you just go for two weeks instead of four?” Again, I said no. I casually suggested she come with me, even though I knew she couldn’t. She had just started her aftercare program and was getting drug tested twice a week.

But I thought, “I deserve this holiday after everything, don’t I?” Instead of staying, instead of prioritising her, or our relationship, or how she felt—I chose myself and “friends,” who weren’t really friends. I ignored that she was in pain. That she was exhausted. That she was still trying.

She still went to therapy. Still doing the work, even in pain. We had to go to A&E again because she could barely walk. She refused stronger meds to protect her sobriety. She was doing everything she could to get stronger.

But I went to A&E with her. Surely that was enough, right?

As soon as I got on the plane to Bali, she blocked me. She was furious and hurt. In her mind, I was choosing a situation that could easily lead to relapse—or worse, cheating—and I’d get away with it. She knew my history. I’d cheated on almost every girlfriend I’d had. I’d always tried to justify it. “It wasn’t really cheating,” or “we weren’t technically together.” But none of that mattered to her. It wasn’t about dating someone else. It was the lying. It was the fact I slept with both her and Lindsey on back-to-back days. That I could’ve exposed her to STIs. That she gave me endless chances to be honest and I still didn’t take them.

She’d been in that position—lying, spiralling—and she felt so sick about it that she went out of her way to change. Why couldn’t I?

Her progress wasn’t perfect, but it was steady. Always moving forward. Blocking me wasn’t just anger—it was fear. Fear of being hurt again. I never stayed blocked for long, usually a few hours. But she felt like extremes were the only way I’d hear her. Talking calmly didn’t work. She was trying to protect herself before I had the chance to hurt her again. But she always came back.  She fully and readily admits it wasn’t healthy but she loved me too much not to.

The whole Bali trip was a mess. Constant arguments. My friend booked a villa, and he told me another girl would be staying there for a while. Mel asked if there were any girls. I lied. Straight to her face. Made her feel paranoid, crazy. She found out eventually. She always does.

And again, she didn’t care about the girl. It was the lie. After Lindsey. After breaking her trust. After saying we’d start fresh. After seeing her sick, grieving, exhausted—I still lied.

She was alone, stuck in bed with a bulging disc, grieving her great-grandmother, dealing with a bunch of scary health issues, and I left. Again.

She started posting more revealing photos with captions like “a wasted summer.” All she wanted was to feel like I gave a shit. And all I did was prove I didn’t.

She looked for validation somewhere else. I saw messages from guys popping up, and she was entertaining them. I’m in Bali, staying true to my word that I wouldn’t be with another girl, “I couldn’t help that my friend arranged to rent out his room”. Not seeing that my lie was the problem. That’s all it took for my head to go to the worst. “She’s at someone else’s house.” I broke up with her and blocked her. Turned off my location. Went out.

What I didn’t tell her was I was taking diazepam. I drank. I hired a prostitute. I was going to sleep with her, but between the Adderall and the drink, I couldn’t get it up. She tried giving me head. Nothing worked. I sent her home.

Then I unblocked Ella.

She was upset. Rightly so. She was scared, confused, trying to figure out what was going on. And I lied. Said I was sober. Said I hadn’t cheated. I twisted it. Made it about her. Got her to apologise to me—knowing full well what I’d done.

All I saw was her reaction, not my actions that caused it. I was still taking lorazepam. Still lying.

Five days later, I relapsed again. Day drinking. I was in a haze. None of my friends stepped in or said anything. Mel posted a picture with her guy friend and I snapped. Felt disrespected. She apologised—even though she didn’t need to. She always did.

I got blackout drunk—mixed alcohol, mirtazapine, lorazepam. Ella could tell immediately just from how I texted. Later she told me she’d been throwing up from the stress of worrying about me.

She called me, got me to send my flight info so she could see when I was coming home. I woke up the next day, realised I couldn’t stay sober out there, and booked the first flight back.

When I got home, I acted like everything was fine. I lied about what happened. Asked Mel not to tell anyone because I was ashamed, but Elle convinced me to own up to my mistakes. And partially I did. But I left out too much. I didn’t think once about how that might make her feel—being asked to keep quiet about my mess.

By that point, she couldn’t even go to her aftercare programs. Her back was so bad. She was later diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. She kept going to therapy. Kept showing up. I wasn’t even honest with my therapist. Couldn’t change, even if I wanted to—and I didn’t want to. I thought showing up was enough.

Part 4. Deceiving her and calling it love.

Her birthday came around. It’s always been a tough day for her—she spent five years deep in addiction, and any birthdays she did remember were tied to abuse or disordered eating. I tried to make a nice day of it. Bought her presents. Took her clothes shopping. But halfway through, she broke down. Thought I was buying her stuff just to shut her up. She didn’t feel worthy of it. She left crying.

We fought. She admits that she went mental and was spiralling but looking back on the messages she was never mean. She was just extremely insecure and self deprecating and hurt. I called her ungrateful. She said she felt like a burden. I didn’t reassure her—I got angry. She got angry too and I used that as an excuse to drink.

She found out. She always does. And even with everything, she came straight over.

That time, I was too ashamed to tell anyone I’d relapsed again. I kept hiding it. From her. From everyone.

Then I got really sick. Had to go to A&E twice. They put me on three different antibiotics and four rounds of steroids. Gave me codeine to help with the coughing and pain. I became incredibly anxious, depressed, and withdrawn. 

Ella stayed with me. Took care of me the whole time. Never once complained.

But it didn’t stop there. Through October and November, I relapsed eight more times. Alcohol. Coke. Codeine. I even went behind everyone’s back to get a benzo prescription. And I drank with it. Said horrible, cruel things to Elle while I was on it.

One night, she just asked me to stay sober long enough for her to rest back at her place. She was exhausted. I said I would. Lied. She ended up sleeping almost two and a half days. While she was out cold, I was drinking. Secretly. She had a feeling. When I admitted it, she came over immediately.

She instantly got in a taxi and called me, begging me to go back inside. When she arrived, I was a mess. Slurring. Trying to get in my car. Didn’t even know what I was doing.

She ended up calling her mum because she couldn’t handle it anymore. Told her everything. And even then, she told me she loved me.

That was the last relapse.

The next morning, she broke down. Slapped me a few times. I had gotten drunk in the morning and taken the last benzo. Still lying to her. Her mum came over and hugged me and basically told me everything was going to be ok and that she loved me. Took us in to theirs. We stayed with her for a few days.

And even then—I still didn’t tell her about Bali. How could I. After everything. Admit to more mistakes. If I just ignore that it happened, it would go away. 

Things stayed rough. Even after promising to change, I was emotionally unavailable. When she told me how she felt—like I didn’t care—I brushed it off. I couldn’t understand what she wanted. I paid the bills, for food, supported her. That’s what love is, right? Gave her empty responses. Half-assed apologies and effort. I’d do things because she’d asked me to, not because I wanted to make things easier for her. She started lashing out again. Getting more and more erratic.

I told her she was reminding me of my dad. The way she spoke. She took it on board instantly. She just wanted to be better. For me. Again.

After Christmas and New Year’s, she crashed.

She couldn’t get out of bed. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t shower. She cried nearly every day. She couldn’t be strong anymore. She was done with carrying everything. I did my best to support her through that. Helped where I could. She agrees—I was there for her. But even then, I was emotionally distant. Closed off.

Part 5: My epiphany. 

And then something in me finally clicked.

I started seeing it all. Everything she’d done for me. Everything she’d carried for me. Everything I took for granted. Things were amazing. It felt like the relationship just worked, we were in sync, I took her into consideration in whatever I was doing. But I still didn’t give her the truth. 

She was the one who pushed me to get my ADHD diagnosis. She was the only person who looked at me and said, “This isn’t just forgetfulness. Something’s off.” She actually cared enough to notice. To push. To help.

She got her spirals under control. What used to last a whole day now only lasted an hour or two—if that. She stayed sober. After everything I put her through, she still hasn’t relapsed. Sixteen months and counting. Not a single one.

She gave up smoking cigarettes—cold turkey—because she knew I hated the smell. She’s been off them for over a year now. Never once picked one back up.

She got herself organised—something I once mentioned in passing—and she remembered. Changed for it. Because I said it mattered to me.

Since we got back together, she hasn’t lied to me. Not once. And every time I’ve double-checked something she’s said—she was telling the truth.

She went deep into trauma work. Stuff she had buried so deep she forgot it was even there. She made herself relive some of the worst moments of her life because she knew that if she didn’t, they’d keep affecting us. She chose to confront it all, just to try and give us a better shot.

Whenever I felt insecure or angry about her past—most of it from five or more years ago—she didn’t get defensive. She didn’t shut me out. She answered every stupid, insecure question I had, over and over, with patience. She minimised and suppressed events from her past, painted it in a different, more positive light, to protect herself. But I wasn’t able to see that without her spelling it out.

When I said that sometimes the way she spoke reminded me of my father, she changed her tone. Just like that. No argument. She just adjusted, because she didn’t want to make me feel the way he did.

She researched everything she could about ADHD—whiteboards, routines, reminders, medication alarms, grocery planning, fridge labels, all of it—just to help me function better.

She gave me space to talk about anything. Never pressured me. Just gently nudged me to keep digging, keep asking why. She helped me figure out what the hell I was even feeling. No one had ever done that for me before.

She taught me how to make decisions for myself. How to stop and ask, “Is this what I want, or is this guilt, or pressure, or fear?” She taught me how to pause.

She always put me first. No matter what she was going through.

And when she made mistakes? She always owned them. Reflected on them. Apologised. Changed.

She always asked me to tell her if she did something that made me feel uncomfortable, because she wanted to grow. To learn how to love me better.

She remembered everything. Every small thing I mentioned. So every present she ever gave me was thoughtful—something I’d actually need or love. Never a throwaway gift. It always meant something.

Everything she did, she did with 100% effort. Even the food she made—she put her all into it. Just so I could have something nice. Something made with care.

She would always try to teach me and show me ways of doing certain menial tasks better. More efficiently. To make my life easier. Things as simple as “hey, shake the damp clean clothes well before hanging them out. Make sure they’re not crumpled either when you hang them on the line and put the heavy stuff on top and lighter stuff on the bottom because heat travels upward.” Small things like that. In that exact example it was because she knew I didn’t like to to iron and was telling me “hey, your way is good, but try it this way. It’s better!” No one ever taught me. Not when I was young. Not growing up. Not even in recent years.

Every time I came back from a trip, I’d come home to a clean apartment. Groceries in the fridge. She didn’t even live there.

She made an effort to remember my mum. We made a little shrine together. Wrote letters and left them there. No one else in my life had ever done that. No one else had even tried.

She organised things for me in a way that made sense for my ADHD. I never appreciated it properly—I’d mess it all up—and she’d still come back and fix it again.

For the first time. I was with somebody who gave the same effort I’d put in during the times we were intimate. She was open. Giving. Enthusiastic. She made sure it felt like connection, not just a thing we did.

She told me how to love her. Told me how to care for her. Told me how to make her feel safe. I ignored it. Or I half-assed it.

She opened up about things no one else knew. Things she’d buried. Things she was ashamed of. She let me in. And I took it badly. Made it about me. Took me six months to understand what she was even trying to tell me—and she was still patient.

She gave me three chances to tell the truth. I still didn’t.

And somehow, she still loved me.

Six weeks ago, I hadn’t fully processed that. I started to get it—but I didn’t feel it all the way through. I didn’t sit with the weight of it.

But then something shifted. I realised how much I bad-mouthed her to my friends. Told them about her spirals. Her reactions. Made her seem like this crazy, erratic woman. Made her look like the problem. Like she was unstable. When in reality? She was hurting. Reacting to everything I was doing behind her back. And even though I hadn’t done so since I got back from Bali, I only realised then how awful I was being to the one person that cared about me. The gravity of my words about the woman I love.

I started to believe she was in this for real. Even though she’d shown that she was through all my relapses. I started actually thinking about her. What she liked. What she needed. What would make her feel seen. And the change was immediate. She noticed straight away. Started thanking me constantly. But not just “thanks.” It was specific.

“Thank you for picking food I can eat (she has allergies)—it makes me feel cared for.”

“Thanks for bringing me painkillers—I didn’t even realise you’d heard me say I had a headache.”

Simple things. Things I should’ve been doing all along. For the first time, I put her needs ahead of mine. And the relationship changed overnight.

She was less anxious. She didn’t spiral. She was finally happy. For once. I saw her smile again. She didn’t look exhausted or drained or on edge. She had that spark back.

Even when she got pregnant and we decided on an abortion, she kept saying, “Thank you, Alex. Thank you for making me feel loved. For doing so much. For finally being thoughtful.”

That was all she wanted. It was so simple. Just effort and honesty. I was doing the bare minimum, and she was blossoming. That’s when I realised just how much extra she’d been doing for me, all this time and how far off I’d been in my way of showing I cared. 

But even then—even while she was going through the abortion—I found a way to ruin it.

Part 6: Fuck me, I’m an asshole.

Right in the middle of it, I decided to pick a fight. About her ex. The drug dealer. The one she went to when she almost relapsed. Even though she was 18, traumatised, addicted, and vulnerable. Even though she didn’t feel like she had a choice. I made it all about me. About how it made me feel. I couldn’t comprehend how she could like and dislike something and someone at the same time. I thought I was doing something wrong. I was, but not what I thought. While she was cramping, nauseous, bleeding out pieces of placenta—I decided that was the right time to start a fight.

And that night, she found out about the prostitute.

She had a gut feeling. Checked a place she hadn’t checked before. Found proof. And that was it. That was the final straw.

I destroyed everything. Again.

She was done. This was a new level of pain. I’d been given every opportunity to come clean. Every moment to start fresh. She had been begging me—begging me—to just be honest. And I couldn’t do it. I’d told her the worst of my actions. Yet still couldn’t admit to her I’d been drinking and using benzos.

I panicked. Got angry. Defensive. Ashamed. Guilty.  I lost it and stabbed myself in the leg four times trying to hit the artery.

She put all of her pain aside and helped me.

Even though she’d just been up all night talking me through my actions, trying to get through to me—she still cleaned me up. Stopped the bleeding. Went to the pharmacy. Disinfected everything. Stitched me back together with butterfly strips so the scars wouldn’t be too big.

And then she said something I’ll never forget.

She said, “You don’t have any empathy.”

And she was right.

She told me how she sees me. Every version of me. The teenager who lost his mum. The scared boy terrified of his father. The child that had to grow up by himself. The young adult doing anything to fit in, afraid of being alone. The grown man now. I’m still anxious, still lost regarding what I want to do, especially after my dad died. She saw me. Through everything. And she still loved me.

She cried while telling me how she’s always put herself in my shoes. Even after I hurt her. Even after all the betrayal, all the lies, all the pain—I was the one she stayed for. She kept repeating “I’m not taking into account what happened before June. We were both fucked up.” She kept apologising for when she emotionally cheated. For the times she was wrong. For the times she lashed out. But I couldn’t see it, and I couldn’t show her that I cared so fucking much about her too. I was the one she backed. I was the one she tried to build a life with. She reminded me: it wasn’t my friends who showed up. Not my grandparents. Not my family. It was her.

After we broke up. After Lindsey. After Bali. After every relapse. When I was sick and couldn’t move. When I was raw and newly sober. When I kept lying. Even then, she was there.She gave me every chance to be honest. “Please just tell me now. Cheating, relapses—anything. Just say it now.” I swore there was nothing else. For eleven days, I still held onto the lie.

And by then, it was just too late.

I fucked it up. Massively.

I hurt the only person in my 31 years of life who ever loved all of me. Not just the good bits. Not just the parts that were easy. She loved the broken pieces, too. The dark stuff. The bits even I couldn’t face. And I hurt her so badly that now—she’s just numb.

And the worst part is, even now, I still catch myself twisting things. Making her seem manipulative. Telling myself she broke up with me when I told the truth. Painting her as unstable, controlling, abusive. Anything to avoid facing what I’ve actually done.

But this isn’t about her. This is about me. Though it should be about her. It should have always been about her. 

Part 7: Who am I?

I’m a coward.
I’m a liar.
I’m a manipulator.
And I’ve been an all-round shitty person. Especially to the one person who only ever showed me love.

Honestly: I don’t think I was ready to be in a relationship. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. I didn’t want to change. I didn’t want to be vulnerable. I didn’t want to take responsibility. I didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. So I lied. I hid. I numbed myself.

And she just kept giving. She gave me her time. Her energy. Her body. Her patience. Her care. Her loyalty. Her whole self. She gave me effort. Consistency. Forgiveness. Again and again. And she fucking admits when she was and has been wrong. She talked to me about it after. She listened to me and took on board everything I said. Even now she admits with no “ifs” or “buts” or shitty explanations to shit she’s done and said in the past that have hurt me. She takes accountability and she tries to be consistently better afterwards. 

When she found out about the prostitute I literally watched the light drain from her eyes. That was a new level of betrayal. One she couldn’t come back from but she still was OPEN TO TRY PROVIDED I TOLD HER THE TRUTH. And she still helped me. Still patched me up. Still cleaned my wounds. Still told me, somehow, that she loved me.

I didn’t just hurt her feelings. I changed how she saw the world. How she saw love. I made her question whether effort and kindness and growth were even worth it.

And that’s on me.

I made her feel like nothing she did mattered. Like none of her progress counted. Like she was still “crazy” or “too much” or “paranoid” even when she was right. Even when her gut was spot on, I told her she was imagining things.

I gaslit her.

I lied, over and over, and every time I got caught, I shifted the blame. Brought up her past. Made her feel like she had no right to be upset.

Even though she’d changed. She’d healed. She had done everything she said she would. She showed up for me over and over again, even when I didn’t deserve it.

And I couldn’t even tell her the truth.

The most painful part is how easy it would’ve been to just be honest. All she ever wanted from me was the truth and some fucking effort. That’s it. Not money. Not perfection. Just honesty and a real shot at being a team.

But I kept making the same choices. Choices that hurt her. And now, she stopped hoping I’d change. There’s nothing I can say to undo that. No apology big enough. No grand gesture that’ll fix it. I’ve said sorry so many times it doesn’t mean anything anymore.

An apology without change is just manipulation and kindness without honesty is deceit. 

She gave me everything she could. And I threw it away. Over and over again. I couldn’t stop lying, even when the truth would’ve set both of us free. She told me—begged me—to be honest. To just say it. To rip the plaster off. And I still waited and let it fester for 11 fucking days. Let her sit there thinking maybe, maybe this time he’s telling the truth.

And every time I chose silence, I chipped away at the last bit of trust she had in me. I get to sit with the fact that I had something most people never find, and I fucking destroyed it.

She was everything I ever wanted. She pushed me. Made me uncomfortable in ways I needed to be. Called me out. Called me in. She fucked up and she owned up to it. When she made mistakes she’d admit them. She fucking thanked me for making her feel okay in the way she looked, in the way she dressed. That I didn’t once shame her or make her feel less than for her scars. For how she was. I realise now that this was the bare minimum. She gave me more chances than I deserved. And yet I still made her feel small. Like none of that mattered. Like her love didn’t count. But it did. She loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. And all she asked for in return was the truth. Real effort. For me to care in the way she cared. To meet her halfway.

And I couldn’t do it.

Part 7: The last lie.

I still struggle with the truth—even now. Even after telling her everything I’ve done, I can’t fully accept that it is the truth. That I really did those things. Slowly, one by one, all my lies have unravelled. When she found out about the prostitute in Bali, she started combing through every detail from the past year and a half. Things surfaced I didn’t even remember doing—things I did while sober. I’d shoved it so deep, even seeing it in black and white barely convinced me it happened.
She told me to come clean to her parents. And I did—about the things she already knew. When they asked if there was anything else, if I could just tell them the rest, they said, “We can work through it.” I promised I’d told them everything.
That was a lie.
I left out that I’d slept with my ex one more time after we’d broken up. Something I denied for a year and three months—every time she asked. I’d convinced myself it didn’t happen. That it wasn’t a big deal. That because it didn’t mean anything to me, I didn’t need to admit it.

I was wrong.

I also went on dating apps way more than I remembered. Nothing came of it, and it never went further than the apps—but it was still cheating. I was still looking elsewhere. There’s no excuse for it. And still, I tried to hold back the truth. Even after her parents showed they could forgive me for the worst things I’d done to their daughter, I still couldn’t be honest. Because I didn’t think they’d find out.
And maybe they wouldn’t have. But eventually, I told Ella. I told her about the dates I went on while in Cyprus—dates with a girl whose name I don’t even remember. We kissed twice. Nothing more. But that’s not the point. I wasn’t loyal. I wasn’t honest. I was scared of being alone, and I used that fear as a license to hurt people.
I made her think she was the disloyal one. I made her feel guilty for messaging exes or downloading an app after I found her texting someone. When I had already done worse. One rule for her. A completely different rulebook for me.
And all the while, I thought I was treating her well. That I was giving her what she needed in a relationship. I don’t know how I got so deluded.
When I finally came clean about my ex and the date, it was after a year and three months of gaslighting her. Something she first suspected when she saw messages I had deleted. Something she’d asked me about over and over, and every time, I made her feel insane for even thinking it.

And still—it took me 11 days to admit it. After she’d gone through an abortion. After she’d found out about the prostitute. After everything. And even then, when she gave me yet another chance to tell the truth, to finally stop running, I couldn’t fucking do it.

So I self-destructed. Like I always do.

I stole alcohol from her apartment. I drank. I drove. I stole wine from a shop at 7:30 in the morning. I drank again. I drove until I ran out of petrol—an hour and a half from home. I was blackout drunk. No plan. No phone. Nobody to turn to. I ditched my phone in a coffee shop so no one could track me, then wandered the streets, drinking as much as I could, hoping I’d die.

That’s how little regard I had for her. For what she might be feeling. For the people looking for me. She thought I was dead. She was beside herself. I didn’t care. I just wanted to disappear.
I somehow ended up at my ex-roommate’s apartment. No idea how I got there. He called Ella. She was frantic. He got me a taxi. She opened her door and took me in. I don’t remember any of it.
That was yesterday.
Today, I owned up to everything. The lies. The manipulation. The cheating. The betrayal. It felt awful—because it wasawful. But seeing what I’d done to the only person who ever truly loved me, who stuck by me—that finally broke through the denial.
And now I’m looking into rehab. An inpatient stay. Because I finally realised: I’m a shitty fucking person. I’ve become the kind of man I promised myself I’d never be. And I hate it. I hate that this is who I’ve been. I want to change.
But it’s come at the cost of destroying someone who didn’t deserve it. A person who only ever gave—who loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. A woman who bent over backwards trying to help me, love me, guide me, support me. She carried me.
And I crushed her in return.
I don’t know if she’ll ever come back from what I’ve done. I don’t know if she’ll ever be the same. But I do know this: I’ll never forgive myself for being the reason she stopped believing that love could be safe.

And she was incredible. Still is.

I just wasn’t man enough to deserve her.

Names have been changed for privacy of my ex and myself. 

I’m (31m) writing this down as objectively as I can. If I start talking, it never comes out right. I’d appreciate it if you could read all of it, because I need it to be heard. I need to be accountable and get help I need to grow as a person. Ella, my ex girlfriend,  (24F) is helping me write it because if you, the reader, will know everything I’ll finally be able to reflect on my past behaviour and work on being a better person. I’m writing it from my point of view to make it easier, but these are Ella’s words too.

Introduction: How we met. How we started. 

---

December 2023

—-


Ella and I met in rehab. I’m an alcoholic; she was a heavy drug user. Total opposites on paper. I’m a clean-cut, easygoing IT sales guy—charming, polished. She was a tattooed, spunky ex-raver. Loud. Electric. A proper session head back in the day. If we hadn’t met in that room, our worlds never would’ve crossed. But somehow, we did—and I’ve never been more grateful for that one-in-a-million chance.

She spotted me first in the home room. She still remembers what I was wearing: black hoodie, shorts, cap, and (in her words) my “big aul Hollywood smile.” I noticed her too. She had two tissues jammed up her nose from her last coke-fueled binge, and still, I was drawn to her. She was loud. Laughed a lot. But beneath it all, I saw the sadness in her eyes. Something real.

I was hooked from the very first conversation.

Part 1: The Breakup. Her redemption. My deception. 

-

This is several months later. May 2024.


We broke up because both of us had a foot out the door. I was closing off. Ella was becoming more erratic. She never brings up anything from before the breakup because she recognises we were both newly sober, traumatised people who had no idea what we wanted. She knows what she did was wrong—talking to a guy in America she’d known for a long time. She hid it. She knew it was emotional cheating and fully accepts that it pushed us toward our first big fallout. She went back to old habits—seeking validation, wanting to feel wanted. Dating sites. I found out through a friend and broke up with her.

She spiralled. Nearly relapsed. Made choices that would’ve led her there. She ended up at her ex’s house—someone who used to be a heavy dealer and generally a shitty person. Ironically, he was sober and was the one who urged her to make things right. That didn’t excuse what she did, but she realised that the pain of hurting me was worse than the comfort of old habits.

She went to A&E and asked for every bit of help she could get. Told her friends, her family, her adopted family. She never once asked me not to tell anyone—she let herself be held accountable. Her own mum told her, straight up, that what she did was horrible and it was on her to change. And even then, she asked everyone around her to look out for me. She told her mum directly, “Be the mum you couldn’t be to me, to him.”

I went to A&E with her—but that was it. I thought being there was enough. I thought I’d done my job.

Throughout the whole breakup, she was honest. No matter how she was feeling, she told me. She was determined to be better—for herself, and for me. She went to therapy. Did an outpatient program for two weeks, then kept going to weekly sessions, both online and in person. After the outpatient part ended, she started looking into aftercare because she knew how close she had come to relapsing. She asked only one thing: if we were going to see other people, to be honest about it. Out of respect. She told me if I wanted to date someone else or sleep with someone else, she’d back off. She repeated that over and over. Gave me so many chances to be honest.

And I lied. 

Part 2: First Relapse. Grief and Relapse. 

I was sober too, at the time. But I hid everything. We were still sleeping with each other when I started seeing Lauren. I lied to two people at once. Manipulated both. Out of fear. Fear of being alone. I prioritised my temporary comfort over how Mel would feel, even after we had promised “no more lies.” Did I work on myself? No. I tried to shag my way out of my feelings. I wasn’t honest with my therapist. Or my friends. Or Mel. Not even with myself.

We saw each other twice at her adoptive dad’s house before things really started to unravel again. She slipped into old, shitty habits. Downloaded a dating app after I told her I wasn’t romantically interested anymore. But she deleted it almost immediately and told me, because we had agreed to be honest. And still, I was annoyed. To the point where she was apologising to me—for downloading a dating app—while I was literally dating and sleeping with someone else.

Then her great-grandmother died. The one who raised her when she was young. She was heartbroken. She could have visited a few weeks before, but she skipped the chance to start therapy. She chose to work on herself instead. I read the messages I sent her during that time and I couldn’t have been less supportive, even when I was trying to be. I was on holiday with Lindsey.

When Ella landed in Romania, it was late. The funeral was the next day. She could tell just from how I was texting that I had been drinking. I was with Lindsey in a bar. I turned off my phone and kept drinking. When I woke up the next day, I didn’t even apologise.

She had stayed awake all night—grieving, anxious, worried about me—just in case I replied. She took time out of the funeral to call me and check on me. Her mum even called me, asking if I was okay, offering to bring me to Romania. They put aside their grief and prioritised me and my relapse.

Looking back at the messages, I didn’t ask her once how she was feeling. I didn’t tell her about Lindsey.

Around then, she started having hormone issues that were getting worse. Doctors didn’t have answers. Test after test. She was constantly tired, freezing cold, foggy. Each blood test came back worse. The appointment with the endocrinologist felt like it was never going to come.

Still, she went to her aftercare. She actually went to two—one full-time, one part-time. And she was honest in all of them. She told people how she hurt me. How she wanted to change. To stay sober. I couldn’t see that.

I broke things off with Lindsey on the last day  of my holiday to try again with Ella. We had a long talk about what we wanted for the future and with each other. We promised openness, honesty, transparency. We said we were going to take this relationship seriously. And for a while, it felt like we meant it.

Then she found out about Lindsey. Three weeks later. I’d deleted an entire chat with a friend. Lied about it—said I was just badmouthing Mel to her which is why I deleted it but she knew something was off. Restored the chat. Found out.

She had every right to be upset. I was defensive. Minimized everything. Blamed her. Brought up what she’d done in the past, ignoring the fact that she was actively working on herself now. That we had turned a new leaf. That we promised to be honest. I hurt her in the exact way she had begged me not to—by lying, by being with another woman. Even though we were broken up, we were still emotionally involved. Still sleeping together. All I had to do was say, “Hey, I want to date other people for a while.” But I didn’t.

The trust broke again. Even though Ella’s spirals had gotten better, the insecurity came flooding back. She lashed out. Got distant. Didn’t know if she could be with me. For 2–3 weeks, she couldn’t decide.

I buried my feelings. Thought, “I forgot about Lindsey easily, why can’t Ella?”

Then she hurt her back. An old injury turned serious. Bulged disc pressing on a nerve. She used to be very active. The gym gave her purpose. Suddenly, that was gone too.


Part 3: Bali. The holiday that broke her. 

Then came Bali. She asked me not to go—for my sobriety. For her doubts about my loyalty, especially in a holiday destination. Because of the wound I left when she found out about Lauren while I was off on another holiday. Her mum was worried too. Tried to talk to me.

I put my foot down. She tried to compromise. “What if you just go for two weeks instead of four?” Again, I said no. I casually suggested she come with me, even though I knew she couldn’t. She had just started her aftercare program and was getting drug tested twice a week.

But I thought, “I deserve this holiday after everything, don’t I?” Instead of staying, instead of prioritising her, or our relationship, or how she felt—I chose myself and “friends,” who weren’t really friends. I ignored that she was in pain. That she was exhausted. That she was still trying.

She still went to therapy. Still doing the work, even in pain. We had to go to A&E again because she could barely walk. She refused stronger meds to protect her sobriety. She was doing everything she could to get stronger.

But I went to A&E with her. Surely that was enough, right?

As soon as I got on the plane to Bali, she blocked me. She was furious and hurt. In her mind, I was choosing a situation that could easily lead to relapse—or worse, cheating—and I’d get away with it. She knew my history. I’d cheated on almost every girlfriend I’d had. I’d always tried to justify it. “It wasn’t really cheating,” or “we weren’t technically together.” But none of that mattered to her. It wasn’t about dating someone else. It was the lying. It was the fact I slept with both her and Lindsey on back-to-back days. That I could’ve exposed her to STIs. That she gave me endless chances to be honest and I still didn’t take them.

She’d been in that position—lying, spiralling—and she felt so sick about it that she went out of her way to change. Why couldn’t I?

Her progress wasn’t perfect, but it was steady. Always moving forward. Blocking me wasn’t just anger—it was fear. Fear of being hurt again. I never stayed blocked for long, usually a few hours. But she felt like extremes were the only way I’d hear her. Talking calmly didn’t work. She was trying to protect herself before I had the chance to hurt her again. But she always came back.  She fully and readily admits it wasn’t healthy but she loved me too much not to.

The whole Bali trip was a mess. Constant arguments. My friend booked a villa, and he told me another girl would be staying there for a while. Mel asked if there were any girls. I lied. Straight to her face. Made her feel paranoid, crazy. She found out eventually. She always does.

And again, she didn’t care about the girl. It was the lie. After Lindsey. After breaking her trust. After saying we’d start fresh. After seeing her sick, grieving, exhausted—I still lied.

She was alone, stuck in bed with a bulging disc, grieving her great-grandmother, dealing with a bunch of scary health issues, and I left. Again.

She started posting more revealing photos with captions like “a wasted summer.” All she wanted was to feel like I gave a shit. And all I did was prove I didn’t.

She looked for validation somewhere else. I saw messages from guys popping up, and she was entertaining them. I’m in Bali, staying true to my word that I wouldn’t be with another girl, “I couldn’t help that my friend arranged to rent out his room”. Not seeing that my lie was the problem. That’s all it took for my head to go to the worst. “She’s at someone else’s house.” I broke up with her and blocked her. Turned off my location. Went out.

What I didn’t tell her was I was taking diazepam. I drank. I hired a prostitute. I was going to sleep with her, but between the Adderall and the drink, I couldn’t get it up. She tried giving me head. Nothing worked. I sent her home.

Then I unblocked Ella.

She was upset. Rightly so. She was scared, confused, trying to figure out what was going on. And I lied. Said I was sober. Said I hadn’t cheated. I twisted it. Made it about her. Got her to apologise to me—knowing full well what I’d done.

All I saw was her reaction, not my actions that caused it. I was still taking lorazepam. Still lying.

Five days later, I relapsed again. Day drinking. I was in a haze. None of my friends stepped in or said anything. Mel posted a picture with her guy friend and I snapped. Felt disrespected. She apologised—even though she didn’t need to. She always did.

I got blackout drunk—mixed alcohol, mirtazapine, lorazepam. Ella could tell immediately just from how I texted. Later she told me she’d been throwing up from the stress of worrying about me.

She called me, got me to send my flight info so she could see when I was coming home. I woke up the next day, realised I couldn’t stay sober out there, and booked the first flight back.

When I got home, I acted like everything was fine. I lied about what happened. Asked Mel not to tell anyone because I was ashamed, but Elle convinced me to own up to my mistakes. And partially I did. But I left out too much. I didn’t think once about how that might make her feel—being asked to keep quiet about my mess.

By that point, she couldn’t even go to her aftercare programs. Her back was so bad. She was later diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. She kept going to therapy. Kept showing up. I wasn’t even honest with my therapist. Couldn’t change, even if I wanted to—and I didn’t want to. I thought showing up was enough.

Part 4. Deceiving her and calling it love.

Her birthday came around. It’s always been a tough day for her—she spent five years deep in addiction, and any birthdays she did remember were tied to abuse or disordered eating. I tried to make a nice day of it. Bought her presents. Took her clothes shopping. But halfway through, she broke down. Thought I was buying her stuff just to shut her up. She didn’t feel worthy of it. She left crying.

We fought. She admits that she went mental and was spiralling but looking back on the messages she was never mean. She was just extremely insecure and self deprecating and hurt. I called her ungrateful. She said she felt like a burden. I didn’t reassure her—I got angry. She got angry too and I used that as an excuse to drink.

She found out. She always does. And even with everything, she came straight over.

That time, I was too ashamed to tell anyone I’d relapsed again. I kept hiding it. From her. From everyone.

Then I got really sick. Had to go to A&E twice. They put me on three different antibiotics and four rounds of steroids. Gave me codeine to help with the coughing and pain. I became incredibly anxious, depressed, and withdrawn. 

Ella stayed with me. Took care of me the whole time. Never once complained.

But it didn’t stop there. Through October and November, I relapsed eight more times. Alcohol. Coke. Codeine. I even went behind everyone’s back to get a benzo prescription. And I drank with it. Said horrible, cruel things to Elle while I was on it.

One night, she just asked me to stay sober long enough for her to rest back at her place. She was exhausted. I said I would. Lied. She ended up sleeping almost two and a half days. While she was out cold, I was drinking. Secretly. She had a feeling. When I admitted it, she came over immediately.

She instantly got in a taxi and called me, begging me to go back inside. When she arrived, I was a mess. Slurring. Trying to get in my car. Didn’t even know what I was doing.

She ended up calling her mum because she couldn’t handle it anymore. Told her everything. And even then, she told me she loved me.

That was the last relapse.

The next morning, she broke down. Slapped me a few times. I had gotten drunk in the morning and taken the last benzo. Still lying to her. Her mum came over and hugged me and basically told me everything was going to be ok and that she loved me. Took us in to theirs. We stayed with her for a few days.

And even then—I still didn’t tell her about Bali. How could I. After everything. Admit to more mistakes. If I just ignore that it happened, it would go away. 

Things stayed rough. Even after promising to change, I was emotionally unavailable. When she told me how she felt—like I didn’t care—I brushed it off. I couldn’t understand what she wanted. I paid the bills, for food, supported her. That’s what love is, right? Gave her empty responses. Half-assed apologies and effort. I’d do things because she’d asked me to, not because I wanted to make things easier for her. She started lashing out again. Getting more and more erratic.

I told her she was reminding me of my dad. The way she spoke. She took it on board instantly. She just wanted to be better. For me. Again.

After Christmas and New Year’s, she crashed.

She couldn’t get out of bed. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t shower. She cried nearly every day. She couldn’t be strong anymore. She was done with carrying everything. I did my best to support her through that. Helped where I could. She agrees—I was there for her. But even then, I was emotionally distant. Closed off.

Part 5: My epiphany. 

And then something in me finally clicked.

I started seeing it all. Everything she’d done for me. Everything she’d carried for me. Everything I took for granted. Things were amazing. It felt like the relationship just worked, we were in sync, I took her into consideration in whatever I was doing. But I still didn’t give her the truth. 

She was the one who pushed me to get my ADHD diagnosis. She was the only person who looked at me and said, “This isn’t just forgetfulness. Something’s off.” She actually cared enough to notice. To push. To help.

She got her spirals under control. What used to last a whole day now only lasted an hour or two—if that. She stayed sober. After everything I put her through, she still hasn’t relapsed. Sixteen months and counting. Not a single one.

She gave up smoking cigarettes—cold turkey—because she knew I hated the smell. She’s been off them for over a year now. Never once picked one back up.

She got herself organised—something I once mentioned in passing—and she remembered. Changed for it. Because I said it mattered to me.

Since we got back together, she hasn’t lied to me. Not once. And every time I’ve double-checked something she’s said—she was telling the truth.

She went deep into trauma work. Stuff she had buried so deep she forgot it was even there. She made herself relive some of the worst moments of her life because she knew that if she didn’t, they’d keep affecting us. She chose to confront it all, just to try and give us a better shot.

Whenever I felt insecure or angry about her past—most of it from five or more years ago—she didn’t get defensive. She didn’t shut me out. She answered every stupid, insecure question I had, over and over, with patience. She minimised and suppressed events from her past, painted it in a different, more positive light, to protect herself. But I wasn’t able to see that without her spelling it out.

When I said that sometimes the way she spoke reminded me of my father, she changed her tone. Just like that. No argument. She just adjusted, because she didn’t want to make me feel the way he did.

She researched everything she could about ADHD—whiteboards, routines, reminders, medication alarms, grocery planning, fridge labels, all of it—just to help me function better.

She gave me space to talk about anything. Never pressured me. Just gently nudged me to keep digging, keep asking why. She helped me figure out what the hell I was even feeling. No one had ever done that for me before.

She taught me how to make decisions for myself. How to stop and ask, “Is this what I want, or is this guilt, or pressure, or fear?” She taught me how to pause.

She always put me first. No matter what she was going through.

And when she made mistakes? She always owned them. Reflected on them. Apologised. Changed.

She always asked me to tell her if she did something that made me feel uncomfortable, because she wanted to grow. To learn how to love me better.

She remembered everything. Every small thing I mentioned. So every present she ever gave me was thoughtful—something I’d actually need or love. Never a throwaway gift. It always meant something.

Everything she did, she did with 100% effort. Even the food she made—she put her all into it. Just so I could have something nice. Something made with care.

She would always try to teach me and show me ways of doing certain menial tasks better. More efficiently. To make my life easier. Things as simple as “hey, shake the damp clean clothes well before hanging them out. Make sure they’re not crumpled either when you hang them on the line and put the heavy stuff on top and lighter stuff on the bottom because heat travels upward.” Small things like that. In that exact example it was because she knew I didn’t like to to iron and was telling me “hey, your way is good, but try it this way. It’s better!” No one ever taught me. Not when I was young. Not growing up. Not even in recent years.

Every time I came back from a trip, I’d come home to a clean apartment. Groceries in the fridge. She didn’t even live there.

She made an effort to remember my mum. We made a little shrine together. Wrote letters and left them there. No one else in my life had ever done that. No one else had even tried.

She organised things for me in a way that made sense for my ADHD. I never appreciated it properly—I’d mess it all up—and she’d still come back and fix it again.

For the first time. I was with somebody who gave the same effort I’d put in during the times we were intimate. She was open. Giving. Enthusiastic. She made sure it felt like connection, not just a thing we did.

She told me how to love her. Told me how to care for her. Told me how to make her feel safe. I ignored it. Or I half-assed it.

She opened up about things no one else knew. Things she’d buried. Things she was ashamed of. She let me in. And I took it badly. Made it about me. Took me six months to understand what she was even trying to tell me—and she was still patient.

She gave me three chances to tell the truth. I still didn’t.

And somehow, she still loved me.

Six weeks ago, I hadn’t fully processed that. I started to get it—but I didn’t feel it all the way through. I didn’t sit with the weight of it.

But then something shifted. I realised how much I bad-mouthed her to my friends. Told them about her spirals. Her reactions. Made her seem like this crazy, erratic woman. Made her look like the problem. Like she was unstable. When in reality? She was hurting. Reacting to everything I was doing behind her back. And even though I hadn’t done so since I got back from Bali, I only realised then how awful I was being to the one person that cared about me. The gravity of my words about the woman I love.

I started to believe she was in this for real. Even though she’d shown that she was through all my relapses. I started actually thinking about her. What she liked. What she needed. What would make her feel seen. And the change was immediate. She noticed straight away. Started thanking me constantly. But not just “thanks.” It was specific.

“Thank you for picking food I can eat (she has allergies)—it makes me feel cared for.”

“Thanks for bringing me painkillers—I didn’t even realise you’d heard me say I had a headache.”

Simple things. Things I should’ve been doing all along. For the first time, I put her needs ahead of mine. And the relationship changed overnight.

She was less anxious. She didn’t spiral. She was finally happy. For once. I saw her smile again. She didn’t look exhausted or drained or on edge. She had that spark back.

Even when she got pregnant and we decided on an abortion, she kept saying, “Thank you, Alex. Thank you for making me feel loved. For doing so much. For finally being thoughtful.”

That was all she wanted. It was so simple. Just effort and honesty. I was doing the bare minimum, and she was blossoming. That’s when I realised just how much extra she’d been doing for me, all this time and how far off I’d been in my way of showing I cared. 

But even then—even while she was going through the abortion—I found a way to ruin it.

Part 6: Fuck me, I’m an asshole.

Right in the middle of it, I decided to pick a fight. About her ex. The drug dealer. The one she went to when she almost relapsed. Even though she was 18, traumatised, addicted, and vulnerable. Even though she didn’t feel like she had a choice. I made it all about me. About how it made me feel. I couldn’t comprehend how she could like and dislike something and someone at the same time. I thought I was doing something wrong. I was, but not what I thought. While she was cramping, nauseous, bleeding out pieces of placenta—I decided that was the right time to start a fight.

And that night, she found out about the prostitute.

She had a gut feeling. Checked a place she hadn’t checked before. Found proof. And that was it. That was the final straw.

I destroyed everything. Again.

She was done. This was a new level of pain. I’d been given every opportunity to come clean. Every moment to start fresh. She had been begging me—begging me—to just be honest. And I couldn’t do it. I’d told her the worst of my actions. Yet still couldn’t admit to her I’d been drinking and using benzos.

I panicked. Got angry. Defensive. Ashamed. Guilty.  I lost it and stabbed myself in the leg four times trying to hit the artery.

She put all of her pain aside and helped me.

Even though she’d just been up all night talking me through my actions, trying to get through to me—she still cleaned me up. Stopped the bleeding. Went to the pharmacy. Disinfected everything. Stitched me back together with butterfly strips so the scars wouldn’t be too big.

And then she said something I’ll never forget.

She said, “You don’t have any empathy.”

And she was right.

She told me how she sees me. Every version of me. The teenager who lost his mum. The scared boy terrified of his father. The child that had to grow up by himself. The young adult doing anything to fit in, afraid of being alone. The grown man now. I’m still anxious, still lost regarding what I want to do, especially after my dad died. She saw me. Through everything. And she still loved me.

She cried while telling me how she’s always put herself in my shoes. Even after I hurt her. Even after all the betrayal, all the lies, all the pain—I was the one she stayed for. She kept repeating “I’m not taking into account what happened before June. We were both fucked up.” She kept apologising for when she emotionally cheated. For the times she was wrong. For the times she lashed out. But I couldn’t see it, and I couldn’t show her that I cared so fucking much about her too. I was the one she backed. I was the one she tried to build a life with. She reminded me: it wasn’t my friends who showed up. Not my grandparents. Not my family. It was her.

After we broke up. After Lindsey. After Bali. After every relapse. When I was sick and couldn’t move. When I was raw and newly sober. When I kept lying. Even then, she was there.She gave me every chance to be honest. “Please just tell me now. Cheating, relapses—anything. Just say it now.” I swore there was nothing else. For eleven days, I still held onto the lie.

And by then, it was just too late.

I fucked it up. Massively.

I hurt the only person in my 31 years of life who ever loved all of me. Not just the good bits. Not just the parts that were easy. She loved the broken pieces, too. The dark stuff. The bits even I couldn’t face. And I hurt her so badly that now—she’s just numb.

And the worst part is, even now, I still catch myself twisting things. Making her seem manipulative. Telling myself she broke up with me when I told the truth. Painting her as unstable, controlling, abusive. Anything to avoid facing what I’ve actually done.

But this isn’t about her. This is about me. Though it should be about her. It should have always been about her. 

Part 7: Who am I?

I’m a coward.
I’m a liar.
I’m a manipulator.
And I’ve been an all-round shitty person. Especially to the one person who only ever showed me love.

Honestly: I don’t think I was ready to be in a relationship. I thought I was, but I wasn’t. I didn’t want to change. I didn’t want to be vulnerable. I didn’t want to take responsibility. I didn’t want to feel uncomfortable. So I lied. I hid. I numbed myself.

And she just kept giving. She gave me her time. Her energy. Her body. Her patience. Her care. Her loyalty. Her whole self. She gave me effort. Consistency. Forgiveness. Again and again. And she fucking admits when she was and has been wrong. She talked to me about it after. She listened to me and took on board everything I said. Even now she admits with no “ifs” or “buts” or shitty explanations to shit she’s done and said in the past that have hurt me. She takes accountability and she tries to be consistently better afterwards. 

When she found out about the prostitute I literally watched the light drain from her eyes. That was a new level of betrayal. One she couldn’t come back from but she still was OPEN TO TRY PROVIDED I TOLD HER THE TRUTH. And she still helped me. Still patched me up. Still cleaned my wounds. Still told me, somehow, that she loved me.

I didn’t just hurt her feelings. I changed how she saw the world. How she saw love. I made her question whether effort and kindness and growth were even worth it.

And that’s on me.

I made her feel like nothing she did mattered. Like none of her progress counted. Like she was still “crazy” or “too much” or “paranoid” even when she was right. Even when her gut was spot on, I told her she was imagining things.

I gaslit her.

I lied, over and over, and every time I got caught, I shifted the blame. Brought up her past. Made her feel like she had no right to be upset.

Even though she’d changed. She’d healed. She had done everything she said she would. She showed up for me over and over again, even when I didn’t deserve it.

And I couldn’t even tell her the truth.

The most painful part is how easy it would’ve been to just be honest. All she ever wanted from me was the truth and some fucking effort. That’s it. Not money. Not perfection. Just honesty and a real shot at being a team.

But I kept making the same choices. Choices that hurt her. And now, she stopped hoping I’d change. There’s nothing I can say to undo that. No apology big enough. No grand gesture that’ll fix it. I’ve said sorry so many times it doesn’t mean anything anymore.

An apology without change is just manipulation and kindness without honesty is deceit. 

She gave me everything she could. And I threw it away. Over and over again. I couldn’t stop lying, even when the truth would’ve set both of us free. She told me—begged me—to be honest. To just say it. To rip the plaster off. And I still waited and let it fester for 11 fucking days. Let her sit there thinking maybe, maybe this time he’s telling the truth.

And every time I chose silence, I chipped away at the last bit of trust she had in me. I get to sit with the fact that I had something most people never find, and I fucking destroyed it.

She was everything I ever wanted. She pushed me. Made me uncomfortable in ways I needed to be. Called me out. Called me in. She fucked up and she owned up to it. When she made mistakes she’d admit them. She fucking thanked me for making her feel okay in the way she looked, in the way she dressed. That I didn’t once shame her or make her feel less than for her scars. For how she was. I realise now that this was the bare minimum. She gave me more chances than I deserved. And yet I still made her feel small. Like none of that mattered. Like her love didn’t count. But it did. She loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. And all she asked for in return was the truth. Real effort. For me to care in the way she cared. To meet her halfway.

And I couldn’t do it.

Part 7: The last lie.

I still struggle with the truth—even now. Even after telling her everything I’ve done, I can’t fully accept that it is the truth. That I really did those things. Slowly, one by one, all my lies have unravelled. When she found out about the prostitute in Bali, she started combing through every detail from the past year and a half. Things surfaced I didn’t even remember doing—things I did while sober. I’d shoved it so deep, even seeing it in black and white barely convinced me it happened.
She told me to come clean to her parents. And I did—about the things she already knew. When they asked if there was anything else, if I could just tell them the rest, they said, “We can work through it.” I promised I’d told them everything.
That was a lie.
I left out that I’d slept with my ex one more time after we’d broken up. Something I denied for a year and three months—every time she asked. I’d convinced myself it didn’t happen. That it wasn’t a big deal. That because it didn’t mean anything to me, I didn’t need to admit it.

I was wrong.

I also went on dating apps way more than I remembered. Nothing came of it, and it never went further than the apps—but it was still cheating. I was still looking elsewhere. There’s no excuse for it. And still, I tried to hold back the truth. Even after her parents showed they could forgive me for the worst things I’d done to their daughter, I still couldn’t be honest. Because I didn’t think they’d find out.
And maybe they wouldn’t have. But eventually, I told Ella. I told her about the dates I went on while in Cyprus—dates with a girl whose name I don’t even remember. We kissed twice. Nothing more. But that’s not the point. I wasn’t loyal. I wasn’t honest. I was scared of being alone, and I used that fear as a license to hurt people.
I made her think she was the disloyal one. I made her feel guilty for messaging exes or downloading an app after I found her texting someone. When I had already done worse. One rule for her. A completely different rulebook for me.
And all the while, I thought I was treating her well. That I was giving her what she needed in a relationship. I don’t know how I got so deluded.
When I finally came clean about my ex and the date, it was after a year and three months of gaslighting her. Something she first suspected when she saw messages I had deleted. Something she’d asked me about over and over, and every time, I made her feel insane for even thinking it.

And still—it took me 11 days to admit it. After she’d gone through an abortion. After she’d found out about the prostitute. After everything. And even then, when she gave me yet another chance to tell the truth, to finally stop running, I couldn’t fucking do it.

So I self-destructed. Like I always do.

I stole alcohol from her apartment. I drank. I drove. I stole wine from a shop at 7:30 in the morning. I drank again. I drove until I ran out of petrol—an hour and a half from home. I was blackout drunk. No plan. No phone. Nobody to turn to. I ditched my phone in a coffee shop so no one could track me, then wandered the streets, drinking as much as I could, hoping I’d die.

That’s how little regard I had for her. For what she might be feeling. For the people looking for me. She thought I was dead. She was beside herself. I didn’t care. I just wanted to disappear.
I somehow ended up at my ex-roommate’s apartment. No idea how I got there. He called Ella. She was frantic. He got me a taxi. She opened her door and took me in. I don’t remember any of it.
That was yesterday.
Today, I owned up to everything. The lies. The manipulation. The cheating. The betrayal. It felt awful—because it wasawful. But seeing what I’d done to the only person who ever truly loved me, who stuck by me—that finally broke through the denial.
And now I’m looking into rehab. An inpatient stay. Because I finally realised: I’m a shitty fucking person. I’ve become the kind of man I promised myself I’d never be. And I hate it. I hate that this is who I’ve been. I want to change.
But it’s come at the cost of destroying someone who didn’t deserve it. A person who only ever gave—who loved me in ways I didn’t even know how to receive. A woman who bent over backwards trying to help me, love me, guide me, support me. She carried me.
And I crushed her in return.
I don’t know if she’ll ever come back from what I’ve done. I don’t know if she’ll ever be the same. But I do know this: I’ll never forgive myself for being the reason she stopped believing that love could be safe.

And she was incredible. Still is.

I just wasn’t man enough to deserve her.

Its been great until I moved into this new appartement, which has carpets almost everywhere. So I decided to get a simple robovac that only has a vacuum feature.After some research, I settled on the X5 Hybrid, I didn't care much about the removeable stick but it turns out I use it a lot more often than I thought.

I found it quite useful for quick cleanups, like yesterday morning I spilled some coffee powder on the floor, I just picked up the stick and moved the robot to where I wanted it to be, pressed the power button on the stick and done. I don't have to open the app - select the cleaning area - and wait for the robovac to take its time. Honestly, it'a lot easier than I thought, just give it a gentle push and the robovac moves smoothly. The suction is also good, no problem picking up long hairs and does not tangle at all. 

I know a lot of people are going with the stick vacuum plus steam mop combination to do the house cleaning, I am just glad to find another possibility, but if you have a better way to do carpet cleaning, please let me know in the comment! Thanks!!",1,1743648214.0,ecovacs,0,1.0,False

1jq79p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1jq79p8/really_bizarre_dream_about_my_childhood_abuse_and/,Really bizarre dream about my childhood abuse and Batman Forever,"This was a really weird dream, so stick with me here.

  
The first half was really troubling. My mom had gotten back with a guy that she was dating when I was in middle school who was really emotionally abusive towards me. Except in this dream, he was even more physical and malicious than he ever was. I was in my mom's bedroom asking her about something and he proceeds to throw a coffee mug at me and then he went somewhere (I don't remember where). I told my mom that his track record had been really bad lately and that I had to leave home because I was actually afraid he would kill me. I then went into a night table drawer on his side of the bed and found a Swiss army knife and three guns, which solidified my decision. I gathered everyone around and told them I was leaving and his kids (who weren't actually his real kids, they were my mom's current boyfriend's daughters) were really torn up about me leaving for some reason and were crying. My mom was crying too, but my brother was more optimistic and knew that we would hang out again in the very near future so he wasn't as sad. I then went on my way.

  
The second half of the dream is where it becomes more fun, but also more weird. I drove to a town about 15 minutes away from mine, but it looked different, looking more like a desertous version of the Hollywood Hills. And in the center of everything was a large scale replica of Wayne Manor from the film ""Batman Forever"". I went inside to find the interiors were accurate to the movie as well and that it was some sort of museum. I looked around, but deliberately chose to not enter the Batcave yet because I wanted to save it for the end. Most of the first floor was screen accurate, but the upstairs was a Dave and Busters style arcade themed after the movie. I distinctly remember one room had a game called ""Hunt the Riddler"", a sort of laser tag/shooting gallery thing where you shot Riddler goons and then the Riddler himself with laser guns. I then ran into an old buddy of mine from middle school I hadn't seen in a long time and we looked around a bit more before finally going down into the Batcave and then leaving out the backdoor. I then asked if I could live with him for a little bit and he agreed before the dream ended.

  
The only part of the dream I understand was why it was themed after ""Batman Forever"". I took melatonin last night to help me sleep and just before I finally fell asleep, my brother texted me that Val Kilmer had died. But everything else is a mystery. Why was my mom's ex being so mean to me? Why did the nearby town look like LA? Why was part of the museum an arcade? Why did I run into my middle school friend? I'm legitimately confused lol

  
TL;DR: I dreamed about running away from home to avoid my mom's abusive boyfriend, ending up in a ""Batman Forever"" themed museum, and reuniting with a friend from my youth.",1,1743648179.0,DreamInterpretation,0,0.99,False

1jq790n,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1jq790n/will_this_version_of_omad_work/,Will this version of OMAD work?,"Hi - I'll put my exact question upfront, then elaborate a bit after. I would very much welcome your thoughts, as I have been struggling alone for some time. 

I am a 5'5"" 205 lb 38 year old Female. 
I wake at 4:30 am
Then I go to the gym at 5:30 and do cardio for 20 minutes, then either weights, yoga, or swinming for 40 minutes 

If I drink coffee all day with light half n half, (probably ~100 calories total), and then break my ""fast"" around 3-6pm, to consume 2 glasses of wine (250 calories) and then eat a reasonably well balanced 1500 calorie meal [1850 calories total] will this -

A) sustain me during my workout and following workday?

B) cause me to lose weight?

Background:

After being healthy and fit my entire young life, I started gaining weight in my late 20s, and I've been *this* overweight for the last 5 years.

I originally gained the weight through excessive drinking, depression eating, stress eating, and quitting working out 

I have always been a big/frequent eater, even when I was 125 lbs of muscle 

I have tracked my calories at many points during the last few years, but I find it exhausting to enter calories for several meals each day

Recently I quit drinking for 6 months thinking I would at least lose *some* weight - but no, I lost nothing, which is crazy to me because I'm certain I was consuming around 3000 calories daily back them and now it's like 2400 calories daily

But quitting drinking taught me something - finding sources of ""dopamine"" throught the day is critical to a sense of well being... food is one of those sources

I know, I know, ""find healthier sources of dopamine"", but I'm poor as shit, single, don't own a car, and have a ton of responsibilities on my back at the moment... I go to the gym and play guitar daily. I practice mindful mediation and go to therapy twice a week. I am on Metformin. It's still not enough to curb the *strong* desire to over eat.

So I am drinking again (normal amounts this time)    

And I am wondering if OMAD would be a good idea for a ""volume eater"" like me

I also figure it'll be alot easier to track calories with OMAD

The only thing is, I don't think I could do without the little bit of half and half in my coffee during the day - black coffee on an empty stomach makes me hurl, and I have severe ADHD that can't be treated with meds due to side effect intolerance (I've tried them *all*), so strong coffee is all I've got

What do you guys think? Anyone here like me? Could this work or will I possibly over eat at night due to fasting all day?

So I was semi-recovered when my friend began to develop an ED as well (which indirectly led me to relapse, oops). Now, because I know how shitty this disorder is, I’ve always made it a point to hide it from other people and avoid weight loss talk around others. ESPECIALLY girls my age because I know we’re the ones who get hit the worst with body image issues, unrealistic beauty standards etc etc 

Anyways the point is, if I got invited out to eat or if someone was having a party and gave me cake, I participated. I fasted or restricted a day before the event and after, but not during. I did not talk about the calories or the sodium’s or sugars or anything negative about the food. 

Unfortunately my friend is the complete opposite and broadcasts her ED, even to new people we’ve barely met. She is gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free and will make it a point to only order Diet Coke or black coffee to any outing. She criticizes the menu and calories of places we’re invited to as well.  

I see where she’s coming from 100% and have tried to be inclusive in our outings but I just don’t understand how she can be so blatant about not eating without worrying about others catching on. And yes, she has a therapist and psychiatrist for this and her parents are aware and I check in with her weekly, but that still does not make it any easier that her struggles just seem to make me fall harder into my own ED. 

The worst part is that our other friends have began to feel self conscious while eating in front of her and asked me not to include her on certain invitations bc we know she’s going to complain about the food anyways. It makes me feel so guilty bc I know that’s pushing her further into isolation but nothing I say gets through to her. ",5,1743647989.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

Hey MaximizeMe crew! 👋

Let’s have a real talk about the love-hate relationship many of us have with multitasking. Ever tried juggling *breakfast*, *emails*, and that lingering *cat hairball* under the couch all at once? Pretty sure I’m not the only one who’s found my brain trying to be a circus performer without realizing it's dropped all the proverbial balls! 🎪

I used to think multitasking was the secret sauce to productivity. Spoiler alert: it’s actually the recipe for chaos! 😅 Turns out, our brains aren’t great at genuine multitasking. **It splits your focus**, **increases stress**, and let’s be honest, makes you forget whether you shampooed your hair or just conditioned it twice. 🙃

So, here's what worked wonders for me: **10-Minute Habit Stacking**. 💡

**What’s Habit Stacking, you ask?**

Imagine pairing smaller tasks together that naturally fit—like stacking LEGO for your life! 🧩 Here’s how I cut through the noise and saved a whopping 10 hours a week:

- **Morning Freshness**: 
  - Combine stretching with planning your day. While stretching out those sleepy muscles in the morning, mentally walk through your top priorities. 
  - Pro-tip: Add a dash of gratitude—saying out loud three things you’re thankful for while you reach for the sky. 🧘‍♂️

- **Coffee + Reading**: 
  - Instead of scrolling (you know we all do it), dive into a 10-minute podcast or audiobook while sipping your coffee. Boom! Skills upgraded with your caffeine boost. ☕📚

- **Lunch Hustle**: 
  - Turn lunchtime into learning time. Listen to educational videos that don’t require you to stare at a screen—perfect for when your mouth and brain are both working. 😉🍽️

- **Commute Focus**:
  - If you're driving, line up podcasts or motivational playlists that pump you up for the day ahead or help you unwind. For public transport riders? Fabulous moment to mind map any ideas that float around. 🚗🚌🎧

**Why It Works:**
- It's all about **enhancing focus**—because when you layer habits, you're reducing the brain's need to switch gears constantly. 
- You’re not trying to do *everything all the time*, but rather a few things that complement each other well.
- The hidden bonus? Seriously lowers stress levels and makes the day feel *more like a smooth sail*, less like a hectic race. 🌊

I (26F) have been experiencing intense period-like cramps around the same time every night. It’s always after I’ve eaten dinner and time for bed is coming close. I know it’s not my period because I take birth control pills and only get my period when I take the iron pills once every 3 months. I don’t miss doses and I’ve never had bleeding outside of when I’m scheduled to. Period comes and goes like clockwork. 

A few months ago I had a Pap smear come back abnormal. I had a colposcopy and ended up having 3 biopsy samples taken. Two were benign and one was “mild cervical dysplasia” I was told this was no big deal and I just have to get a pap every year now. Totally dreading this because Pap smears are so painful. It’s more the speculum that’s painful than anything else but I’ve been made to feel dramatic. The biopsies being taken in my colposcopy were so painful I was bawling my eyes out and having a panic attack. The doctor could not get the bleeding to stop for quite some time and I ended up having that weird coffee-ground stuff coming out for way longer than they said it would. I also had a metallic smell for weeks. 

Before the abnormal pap, I had a day last summer where I had this weird clump of something come out of me and some really intense on and off cramps for days. I saw the doctor and all STI tests were negative. However, my cervix was painful to the touch and there was a discharge so they sent me to the ER for fear that I was having PID. They found nothing wrong and sent me home with advil. No surprise there. 

I went to the doctor again because the cramps did not stop. The doctor considered I may have endometriosis but wasn’t willing to do a laparoscopy AND I QUOTE “until the pain was unbearable” so he prescribed me medicine for it - called Orilissa. I took it for 6 months and noticed it helped a bit, mostly just dulled the cramps. Didn’t get rid of them. Had to stop taking it because the night sweats it was giving me actually were unbearable. 

Now we are current. The only other symptoms I’ve been having is that my bowel movements are really not great. Not super regular and when they do happen it’s now or never. I get this intense stomach pain and onset of nausea if I wait even 5 minutes before going to the bathroom. I am also VERY gassy - both burping and farting unfortunately. And the gas is horrible smelling. I swear my boyfriend doesn’t even want to be near me when it happens. 

Has anyone experience anything like this? What is the problem? Is it my stomach? Do I have endometriosis? Am I just disgusting and screwed? 

TLDR; experiencing stomach and reproductive pain and other symptoms. Looking for others who have had similar issues and what they’ve done. I have a doctor’s appointment coming up where I’ll try to explore the stomach part of it since it’s fairly new.

She said that should be good and I thanked her for helping me and I thought that was the end of everything. 

I saw her this morning and everything seemed fine, I even offered to make her breakfast and coffee and cleaned up my FIL dishes. Nothing seemed to be wrong until I heard them arguing while I was in the bathroom how I messed up the oven and how my MIL told me to clean it but I didn’t, which wasn’t true at all. I’ve always cleaned for my in laws no matter what, even doing their spring cleaning for them immediately when asked! I wanted to talk to them about it but I went to my husband and he said if they don’t bring it up to my face then it’s not that big of a deal. He went out to talk to them and they lied again, saying that she told me to do it but I didn’t, and asked if I told him about it. He said he didn’t hear about it but we’ll clean it tonight.

My problem is I don’t know what I’m gonna do when I see them, I have to see them in the morning for work because they’re always in the living room and I know my FIL is going to say something about it to me. My FIL is a VERY hotheaded person and will go 0-100 over the smallest of things, if I say his wife lied he’s going to immediately start a screaming match with me and my husband too. I don’t want to cause any problems but it hurts me so much emotionally to have to lie about this. I wouldn’t something like that, I pride myself in being responsible and this just feels like a slap in the face. My husband says I should say the truth but the fear of getting yelled is too much. We move out next month so I was thinking I should just lie and say it slipped my mind and apologize. What’s the smartest way to go about this?",2,1743646817.0,makemychoice,6,1.0,False

* 100 regular-sized donuts
* 80 pieces of ham and cheese Bunwiches (for a savoury option)
* 250 Munchkins

2. We’ll also have an **Ice Cream and Coffee/Juice Cart**.

What do you think of this setup? There won’t be any additional food aside from Dunkin’ since the corkage fee for each food cart is ₱10,000.

P.S. I know the number of donuts seems more than enough for the guests, but Dunkin' has a minimum order requirement of ₱12,000.

I also had image exams of my kidneys, uterus, bladder and urethra, all of which were absolutely normal according to my gynecologist  ≈ 1 year ago or so.

However, I feel discomfort peeing, my urethra burns, it is followed by the feeling of not having fully emptied my bladder (this feeling doesn't go away unless I drink A LOT of water, but it doesn't ever FULLY go away). Sometimes it also burns randomly through the day even when I don't have a full bladder. It gets especially bad if I don't drink a lot of water, it feels as if there's something blocking my urethra, and if I try really hard to make the remaining urine come out (which hurts quite a lot) it comes out absolutely burning.
I also have really bad back pain around my lower back, however I am a student who carries a considerably heavy backpack for most of the day, and I spend around 3 hours standing up so I can commute to university.
My urine smells normal, it also has it's usual color (despite being really transparent because of the amount of water I drink in order to feel less uncomfortable).
I've tried changing my diet, stopped drinking soda, coffee and alcohol, but nothing really happened despite it feeling slightly less uncomfortable.

I don't have any history of illness besides being anemic a bit too often, but I have since then had iron infusions and I haven't been anemic anymore for a year or so. My grandmother is diabetic, my insulin levels are normal however.
I went to the doctor for this specific issue once, but they only gave me an antibiotic which made the problem go away for 2 weeks, and then it came back. Because of this I have taken other antibiotics, but they didn't have any results at all.
I have sex every month or so with my boyfriend, we use protection and I properly wash myself after. I however have not had any problems like this prior to meeting him.
I have been sedentary for most of my life.
I can provide my blood work results if needed.
I really need help, this has been driving me nuts.",1,1743646731.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
1jq6s2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jq6s2o/should_i_lie_or_tell_the_truth/,Should I lie or tell the truth?,"To give backstory, the other day I (25F) was baking potatoes in the oven after my MIL finished baking in it and it started smoking really bad so I turned it off before it can start a fire and asked my MIL, whom was in the living room, what I should do and she came in and instructed me to take it out and turn on the self cleaning function on the oven. She said that should be good and I thanked her for helping me and I thought that was the end of everything. 

I saw her this morning and everything seemed fine, I even offered to make her breakfast and coffee and cleaned up my FIL dishes. Nothing seemed to be wrong until I heard them arguing while I was in the bathroom how I messed up the oven and how my MIL told me to clean it but I didn’t, which wasn’t true at all. I’ve always cleaned for my in laws no matter what, even doing their spring cleaning for them immediately when asked! I wanted to talk to them about it but I went to my husband and he said if they don’t bring it up to my face then it’s not that big of a deal. He went out to talk to them and they lied again, saying that she told me to do it but I didn’t, and asked if I told him about it. He said he didn’t hear about it but we’ll clean it tonight.

My problem is I don’t know what I’m gonna do when I see them, I have to see them in the morning for work because they’re always in the living room and I know my FIL is going to say something about it to me. My FIL is a VERY hotheaded person and will go 0-100 over the smallest of things, if I say his wife lied he’s going to immediately start a screaming match with me and my husband too. I don’t want to cause any problems but it hurts me so much emotionally to have to lie about this. I wouldn’t something like that, I pride myself in being responsible and this just feels like a slap in the face. My husband says I should say the truth but the fear of getting yelled is too much. We move out next month so I was thinking I should just lie and say it slipped my mind and apologize. What’s the smartest way to go about this?",1,1743646722.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Friday will (hopefully) be the last time I sit for the MCAT, as I have taken it twice before (503/508). I am, in SDN terms, a “reinventor.” I barely graduated college and pulled my gpa up to a 3.1 with a DIY postbacc. My goal is DO, and I knew I needed a good MCAT score to somewhat compensate for my gpa. So I absolutely immersed myself in studying for this test. 

It was extremely difficult (as you can see in my first score) because my foundational knowledge was so poor. I had to re-teach myself everything before I could even begin to approach the actual MCAT format. 

This test has been my life since 2023 (although I have taken breaks). Every morning I’d just wake up, go to a coffee shop, and study for this. I am pretty lonely at this point in my life and not happy with my progress career-wise, so this kept me distracted and gave me purpose. To be honest, I am going to miss this routine. 

So what do I do after Friday? I have no idea. I guess I’ll start working on those essays, which feels like an impossible tast, but so too did the MCAT. I guess I never actually thought I’d make it this far.

Smaller excercises ill have a warm up set then usually a few sets at my higher weight/rep range. Once I hit above 8 solid reps at a weight I look at upping the weight, depending on the excercise.

I will do most of these excercises. Some days i might drop some or change them to mix it up, or focus on a lacking muscle area.

> Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!
> 
> A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.
> 
> A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.
> 
> SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.
> 
> THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.
> 
> UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.
> 
> UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.
> 
> ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.
> 
> CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.
> 
> AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.
> 
> PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.
> 
> These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

It was in a skinny tall 12 oz can and had a plain old design and a dark red color. While down there I drank another Coke from a coffee shop. This coke was in a modern-looking can like we buy in the US and it tasted different from the grocery store Coke - much less sweet and flavorful. I went back to the grocery store to get the good stuff and again it was much bolder and more flavorful - even the can had a darker red color like how I remember it years ago.

I checked the ingredient labels and they were the exact same. They were both sweetened with HFCS.

What I'm trying to say is I think the Coke formula changed at some point. Nowadays I drink Coke every day and it's just bland - like eating food without enough salt. I can't pinpoint when they made this change but it is a different product than what it was 1-2+ years ago. I buy Mexican cokes sometimes and those have also developed a bland flavor. Before having the old Coke in Grand Cayman I thought my taste buds might be changing, but that experience was nostalgic and reminded me of what Coke used to taste like. I still drink it often but I feel the overall quality of flavor has declined.

Let me know if you have more info on this or if you have experienced a similar thing.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I need your help and experiences, but first—some context. I’ll try to keep it concise.  

I’m a 32-year-old man who’s struggled with anxiety since childhood (though I wasn’t fully aware of it at the time). Around August last year, I was diagnosed with ADHD—first by my psychologist, then confirmed by a psychiatrist.  

I started seeing my current therapist two years ago after a *brilliant* idea backfired: I dove into specialty coffee, bought beans from different brands, and began drinking one cup daily. Within weeks, it triggered **horrible** anxiety—insomnia, constant dread, overthinking spirals, and even suicidal thoughts from how miserable I felt.  

I quit coffee and sought therapy (I’d had therapy before and improved significantly, but wanted to try a new approach). Over time, my psychologist noticed ADHD symptoms, and after a bad experience with another psychiatrist, I found my current one.  

Fast-forward: I started sertraline in December and feel **amazing** anxiety-wise. But now, without anxiety keeping me ""alert,"" my ADHD symptoms are glaring—distraction, forgetfulness, procrastination, and even a minor car accident (just a dent, thankfully).  

My psychiatrist thinks it’s time to treat the ADHD. She suggested **methylphenidate** but warned it might spike my anxiety (given my coffee sensitivity). Alternatively, **atomoxetine**, though she mentioned GI side effects (I have a history of nervous colitis) and lower efficacy in adults.  

**My questions for you:**  
- Anyone with ADHD + anxiety had similar reactions to coffee?  
- Which ADHD meds worked for you?  
- Did methylphenidate worsen your anxiety?  
- Experiences with atomoxetine?  
- Any recommendations?  

I’d **really** appreciate any advice or shared experiences. Thanks!  ",1,1743645403.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

1jq6ac3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestBuyBotanicals/comments/1jq6ac3/does_kratom_have_stimulant_or_sedative_effects/,Does kratom have stimulant or sedative effects?,"Kratom can have **both stimulant and sedative effects**, depending on **dosage, strain, and individual response**. Here's a detailed breakdown:

# 1. Stimulant Effects (Low Doses: 1-5g)

At **low doses**, kratom primarily acts as a **stimulant**, similar to coffee but with a unique twist. This is due to its interaction with **adrenergic and dopaminergic systems** in addition to mild opioid receptor activation.

# Effects at Low Doses

* **Increased Energy & Alertness** – Similar to caffeine, kratom enhances focus and reduces fatigue.
* **Improved Mood & Sociability** – Many users report feelings of **well-being, motivation, and mild euphoria**.
* **Enhanced Physical Endurance** – Traditionally, laborers in Southeast Asia have used kratom to **combat exhaustion and improve stamina**.
* **Mild Analgesia** – Some pain relief is still present, but it’s secondary to the stimulant effects.

# Mechanism

* Mitragynine, the dominant alkaloid, interacts with **adrenergic receptors**, increasing **norepinephrine and dopamine** activity.
* This leads to increased wakefulness and mental clarity, much like a mild amphetamine or caffeine boost.
* **Opioid receptors are activated only partially**, keeping sedative effects minimal at this stage.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ui2f26pj0jse1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=052e6529beb884a84b99f0b0659c9d7c227691d7)

# 2. Sedative Effects (Higher Doses: 6-12g)

At **moderate to high doses**, kratom shifts from a stimulant to a **sedative and analgesic**, resembling traditional opioids but with a milder profile.

# Effects at High Doses

* **Relaxation & Calmness** – Users report a deep sense of relaxation, sometimes likened to mild opiate-like effects.
* **Pain Relief** – Kratom becomes **significantly more effective for pain management**, making it popular for chronic pain sufferers.
* **Sedation & Drowsiness** – In higher amounts, it promotes **sleepiness and muscle relaxation**, often used for **anxiety relief or insomnia**.
* **Euphoria** – While not as intense as synthetic opioids, kratom can induce a **mild to moderate euphoric state**.

# Mechanism

* Mitragynine and **7-hydroxymitragynine (7-HMG)** increasingly activate **mu-opioid receptors**, creating opioid-like sedative effects.
* These alkaloids also interact with **GABA and serotonin systems**, promoting relaxation.
* Unlike traditional opioids, kratom does not cause severe **respiratory depression**, making it safer at high doses.

# 3. Factors Influencing Stimulant vs. Sedative Effects

Several factors determine whether kratom will have stimulating or sedating effects:

# Dosage (Most Important Factor)

* **1-5g:** Primarily stimulant effects
* **6-12g:** Sedative, pain relief, and relaxation effects
* **12g+ (Very High Doses):** Heavy sedation, nausea, dizziness (not recommended)

# Strain Type

* **White Vein Strains** – More stimulating, best for energy and focus.
* **Green Vein Strains** – Balanced effects, offering both stimulation and mild pain relief.
* **Red Vein Strains** – More sedating, better for relaxation and pain relief.

# Individual Tolerance & Body Chemistry

* Some people experience stimulant effects at higher doses than others.
* Frequent users may develop **tolerance**, requiring higher doses for sedative effects.

# Empty vs. Full Stomach

* **Empty stomach:** Stimulant effects hit harder and faster.
* **Full stomach:** Effects are more gradual, with stronger sedation at high doses.

# 4. Comparison to Other Substances

|Feature|Kratom (Low Dose)|Kratom (High Dose)|Coffee|Opioids|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Energy Boost**|High|Low|Very High|None|
|**Mental Clarity**|High|Low|High|Low|
|**Pain Relief**|Mild|Strong|None|Very Strong|
|**Euphoria**|Mild|Moderate|Minimal|High|
|**Sedation**|None|Strong|None|Very Strong|
|**Addiction Potential**|Low-Moderate|Moderate|Low|High|

# 5. Conclusion

Kratom is unique in that it can act **both as a stimulant and a sedative**, depending largely on **dose and strain**.

* If taken in **low doses (1-5g)**, kratom **increases energy, focus, and motivation**, making it a natural alternative to coffee or mild stimulants.
* If taken in **moderate to high doses (6-12g)**, it provides **pain relief, relaxation, and sedation**, making it useful for anxiety, stress relief, and opioid withdrawal.

Coffee just makes me incredibly tired and doesn’t give me any energy. I feel like I’m constantly running on empty and I have no energy to do anything. sometimes I’m so tired while driving in the mornings I might accidentally close my eyes and ik that’s not safe but for a moment there’s this overwhelming tiredness and I just want to close my eyes. I always wake up and never feel awake at all or rested I don’t honestly know what that feels like. Sometimes on weekends I sleep for such a long time but then I get sick because I slept way too much but even then my eyes just want to close so badly. I have constant dry eyes I have drops that sometimes help but most of the time it’s only some slight relief before they get dry again. The only time I have ever felt like I had a lot of energy was once when I ate a sugar cube and it felt so amazing I’ve never felt so awake.

I know dry processed coffees are not typically recommended for beginners due to their lack of bean consistency, but I'm a light roast natural process Ethiopian fiend normally, so figured I might as well start with what I'm most familiar with. All roasts were done with a 2oz batch size.  
  
First roast was done in a pan because I figured might as well see why the pan isn't great first hand. Should've been done with cast iron for sure, but I hoped an overabundance of agitation and small batch size would be okay. Honestly tasted surprisingly decent despite its gnarly appearance, but I lost a lot of origin characteristics.

Second roast was done in a flour sifter with manual agitation and heatgun application. Working on building out a better flour sifter roaster system with an arduino controlled heat system and thermocouple to get something close to roast profiling, but decided I want that to feel like an upgrade on the alternative. I set the heat gun far too low and blew a fuse when my wife used the microwave, so it was dramatically underroasted and baked (roasted 19 minutes from start of roast), but upon cupping it honestly was more than tolerable, extremely tea like and with still some more interesting non generic flavors. Espresso was not great, but with milk it was still quite enjoyable if a little too light.

Third roast, still trying to figure out heatgun settings, so kept it on close to the highest heat setting for the duration of the roast. Roasted for 9 minutes and overall much more happy with the amount of development and what seemed like a more noticeable FC despite the noise of the heat gun and small batch size. Upon cupping it was immediately much more flavorful and with stronger, more noticeable flavors. Will try to push the roast level up further I think, but not sure if I should do that with just a longer roast time or whether I should start to tweak heat.",0,1743645161.0,roasting,0,0.5,False

2. Use biogel and use this amazing massager I bought (one of the best purchases as I had lots of very hard and lumpy and painful hard spots and this has helped signficantly)

3. Coffee (or usually 2), then I started the 30-3-12 workout on the tredmill, then shower (use bioderma gel on my boobs)

We’re married now.

The thought brought a small smile to my face as I turned to see you still asleep beside me, your breathing steady and peaceful. It was a simple moment, but it felt significant. The start of something new.

Not wanting to wake you just yet, I carefully slipped out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. Maybe I could surprise you with breakfast—though whether it would turn out edible was another story.

Still, as I stood there, staring at the coffee maker like it held the secrets to marriage itself, I couldn’t help but feel a quiet kind of happiness.


Hi everyone, I am looking to rp as two newlyweds. I would like to include a set of dice or random number generator with random events to make the plot more fun. This would create a set of fun plotlines that really invigorate the story. 

First grocery trip together – They realize they have very different shopping habits and debate over which brand of peanut butter is superior.

Cooking disaster – One of them tries to cook a romantic meal but forgets a key ingredient or burns something.

Lazy rainy day – They stay in pajamas all day, build a blanket fort, and watch old movies.

First big purchase – They go furniture shopping and struggle to agree on a couch or dining table.

Surprise date night – One plans a surprise date, but it doesn't go exactly as intended (maybe they get lost or the restaurant loses their reservation).

Lost wedding ring scare – One panics after misplacing their wedding ring, only to find it in a silly place.

Pet adoption – They consider adopting a pet and visit a shelter, debating over a dog, cat, or something else.

DIY home project gone wrong – They try to assemble furniture or paint a room together, but it turns into chaos.

Meeting the in-laws – A family member makes an unexpected visit, leading to some awkward or funny moments. Here are some ideas for that to add to it.

Game night rivalry – They have a friendly but competitive board game or video game night, and things get hilariously intense.

Morning routine differences – One is an early riser, the other loves to sleep in, leading to amusing compromises.

Holiday decorating – They have different opinions on how to decorate for the holidays, leading to a fun mini-feud.

Surprise gift exchange – They both try to find the perfect small gift for each other and end up with funny or touching results.

Midnight snack runs – They sneak out late at night in pajamas to grab ice cream or fast food.

Anniversary plans gone awry – Their first-month or first-year celebration doesn't go as expected but turns into a great memory anyway.",1,1743645019.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

As much as we hate to admit it, we do good things here. We have the highest standard of living, the lowest rate of gun deaths, the best K – 12 schools, the best institutions of higher learning, the lowest incarceration rate, the lowest auto fatality rate, the best hospitals… we were the first state to legalize trade unions, to legalize same-sex marriage, to abolish slavery, to rule that Black Americans have the same rights as do White Americans…

Did you know the US Constitution was modeled on the Massachusetts Constitution? And it worked really well, and would still work really well if we didn’t have 30 years SCOTUS that fabricated ludicrous and corrupt interpretations of it. (That’s one thing we definitely have to fix.)

And we Massholes will keep on doing what we do, and we will lead our nation forward, to a better place, because that’s just what we do. We can do that at the same time we fight over whether or not a broken lawn chair reserves a parking spot in a snowstorm. (We are uniquely capable of the most bizarre multitasking that is humanly imaginable.)

And it will be powered by delicious donuts and mediocre coffee.

I am furious and frustrated at my spouse a little background we've been married for 12 years, 3 kids (9,7,16 month) I run my own company, handle all duties in the home including cooking cleaning and childcare while still helping him with his business he is also an entrepreneur

So, Thursday I had an accident we're I had a concussion and hairline ankle fracture. So obviously I feel gross and achy. He handles the baby while I was at the hospital and the older kids were at the neighbors

While I was frustrated he didn't think to even offer to have a family member watch the baby while I was waiting in the ER with a neck brace on without being able to move. I kept looking around and it hit me I am literally the only person here without someone, my mom offered however she's 82 with health conditions so obviously I didn't want her there. But the fact my spouse didn't even think to figure out childcare I was upset, he just took out daughter along on his regular day. Whereas if it were him I would have dropped everything found a sitter and been there. That aside which I can chalk up to being a little clueless, since I didn't specifically say I wanted him there.

Friday I woke up obviously groggy and gross keep in mind our baby still gets up multiple times a night so I did that Thursday feeling awful since she's breastfeed and won't take a bottle.

Friday I woke up and it was business as usual he left at 7:30 leaving me to clean up get the kids ready, make lunchs, carry the baby etc. it didn't even occur to him to help me until we had a sitter come from 10-3 just to help. So I frustrated, then he proceeded to let me handle dinner, clean up and bedtime x3 all alone he came in at 7 saying he has a long day and went to the gym. While I can barely move with a massive headache. Again frustrated I told him it would have been nice for him to skip the gym and come home maybe move some of his appointments since he is self employed to help me. He basically said it was not possible since it was short notice, annoying but ok I let it go since I did have help most of the day.

Now here comes the issue, SATURDAY he left the house at 8:00 am saying he has the gym class at 9:30 (which is an hour) I was assuming he would be home around 11:00. He showed up at 3:00 (he did call and say he had to finish some work things) his family all brought over dinners to help me for the next few days which was lovely. When we were sitting here was making such rude comments basically indicating that my injury isn't ""so bad"" I explained that they didn't give me an air cast because it was a hairline fracture and sprain and because I am young and not overweight putting some weight on it would help it help faster when inl said that he was laughing making an ""I'm not sure sure about that face "" m basically slyly saying I am old and overweight ( 36 & 155 lbs) now the real kicker I warmed up dinner then he decided he was going to go to the coffee shop to work on emails 1) he has an office at home 2) he's been gone ALL day I was yup whatever he said he'd be back at 7:00 conveniently missing our youngest bath and bed time then left me to clean up the kitchen and put the kids to bed. He came home at 8:30 PM just said he finished his work, I was already set up in the guest room saying I have a headache truth is yes I have a headache but I am hurt, I feel unsupported, neglected even.

1jq5rol,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1jq5rol/overthinking_and_need_advice/,Overthinking and need advice,"I will try to keep this short and to the point. LO (M37) and I (F35) have been in an infatuation / obsession / cat-and-mouse affair for the past 10 years. We have hooked up in the past, but he rejected me and went with someone else. Broke my heart. I eventually moved on but he would always creep back into my life. LO eventually moved across the country but occasionally comes back home. 

Here are the big differences in how we perceive each other:

- I want him romantically, I want him to want me as a person and accept me for who I am.

- He desires me sexually and has ever since we met (when we were teenagers).


There has been some tug-and-war between these two sides; romance and sexuality. He has been more openly “romantic” and conversational with me, which has made me feel more sexually interested in him.

He occasionally comes home to visit his family and always asks to see me. For the past 10 years I have set up an arrangement to see him (nothing sexual, just coffee or a hang out) and then I cancel last minute out of fear of rejection.

Somethings different this time around where I am
Now comfortable with seeing him when he comes home for a short visit in May. I even took a day off from work to show that I’m committed to seeing him.

Ever since we put the “plan” in place, he has been extremely short with me, barely talking. Only reaching out if it means the conversation will turn sexual. I want to TALK to him like we were talking before…texting for hours, phone calls for an hour every now and then. But now he’s behaving differently and I’m feeling insecure.

Why is he behaving differently? Is it in my head? Am I overthinking it?

Will it only ever be sexual for him…?",1,1743643808.0,limerence,6,1.0,False

I recently tried switching my style up and doing a different approach. 

This is a rough draft I did today. Based off a poem I wrote a while ago. 

In the languid twilight, the taxi's headlights cast an anemic glow, visible through the rain-slickened window. The peeling billboards, the cramped alleyways, and the endless river of strangers hurrying to nowhere. The young man, ensconced in the backseat. His eyes, red-rimmed from fatigue, felt like two empty wells, drained of all passion and purpose.

As the taxi stopped every few meters in traffic. The driver's silence seemed to take on a palpable form, a living smog that smoked through the interior around the passenger. He felt like a ghost haunting his own life, invisible and insignificant.

Yet, in this desolate landscape, The young man’s gaze began to discern a strange beauty. The rain-soaked streets glistened, like a dirty mirror, reflecting the city’s secrets and sorrows. The neon lights of the convenience stores and fast-food joints flickered like fireflies, casting a gaudy glow over the sidewalks. 

As the taxi halted at a red light, the young man's eyes met those of a stranger on the sidewalk. For an instant, their eyes locked in a flash of mutual recognition, a fleeting sense of solidarity in their shared alienation. Then, the light turned green, and the taxi lurched forward, leaving the stranger behind, lost in the sea of faces.

The young man's heart, a heavy, sodden thing, felt like it was sinking slowly into his chest. He closed his eyes, letting the taxi's motion rock him into a state of numbness, a calm suffering that was both his shield and his prison.

The taxi's wipers swished back and forth, casting a rhythmic spell that seemed to lull the very city itself into a state of somnolence. 

The driver, a gruff but kind-hearted man with a wild shock of white hair, navigated the streets with the ease of a seasoned guide. His eyes, a deep, piercing blue, seemed to hold a world of wisdom, a deep understanding of the human condition. As the taxi glided through the city's streets, the young man felt a sense of comfort wash over him, a feeling of being enveloped in a warm, protective cloak.

The taxi's radio played a soft, lilting melody, a gentle harmony that seemed to match the beat of the young man's heart.

The music was a balm to his soul, a soothing salve that calmed the rough edges of his existence. As the taxi continued on its journey, the young man's eyelids began to droop, his breathing slowing as he surrendered to the calm suffering that had become his life.
In this peaceful, rain-soaked world, the young man found a sense of solace, a feeling of being cradled in the arms of the city itself. The taxi, a humble vessel, had become a sanctuary, a mobile haven that shielded him from the trials and tribulations of the world. As the rain continued to fall, drumming a soothing melody on the taxi's roof, the young man's heart began to heal, his spirit slowly unfolding like a flower in the warm sunlight.

The rain was picking up, a relentless, drumming presence, that seeped into his very marrow, the worn upholstery, seemed to shrink and expand in tandem with the young man's breathing. The driver glanced occasionally in the rearview mirror, his gaze intersecting with the young man's with fleeting, wordless respect.

In this back seat, he found a strange comfort, a sense of being buoyed by the very currents that threatened to engulf him.

The taxi arrived at the young man’s apartment. He payed the driver and tipped well as he could. Up the stone steps. Onto his floor. And into the door, he finally was home. These walls he could recognize. He could look out the window from the couch. 

Here he found solace. The way the raindrops clung to the windowpanes of his apartment, like tiny, transparent tears.

As the hours passed. He saw a beauty that seemed to exist in defiance of the darkness that lurked within him, a beacon of hope in a world that seemed determined to extinguish it.

His joints creaked with a familiar pain. He walked to the window, his eyes drifting out to the sidewalks. Instead he imagined crops swaying gently in the breeze, and in that moment he felt a sense of peace, a sense of belonging to this land, and to the quiet, unassuming valleys that lay just beneath the surface of the everyday.

He decided to go for a walk. Along the gray sidewalks. He passed an occasional tree. Its branches stretching out into the air. Cars pierced through the rising smog. He eventually found a cafe. Despite the condensation, he could see wood and metal furniture. He entered the cafe. The clicking and clattering of cups and utensils skipped across the room. Bounced off the walls. After a couple paces he decided to leave. As he turned he collided with someone. Their coffee mug fell onto the wooden floor. Shattering into pieces. In a trance of momentary guilt, he offered to buy this girl another coffee. To which she refused politely. But on second thought, obliged. 

A waitress seated them both at a table. With a view of the window. 

In the twilight hush of the city, where the dusk poured down the black skyscrapers, which pierced the mist like shards of unseen moonlight, these two strangers found themselves bound by an unspoken camaraderie. Their paths had crossed in a small, secluded café, where the scent of old wood and freshly brewed coffee hung in the air like a promise.

Ava, with her wild tangle of curly hair and eyes that shone like stars in the dim light, sat across from Elijah, his features chiseled from the granite of a thousand midnights. They spoke in hushed tones, their words weaving a basket of shared solitude, as the city outside receded into the fog.

As the evening wore on, they found themselves drawn to the stillness of the meadows, far from the steel and concrete canyons of the city. The breeze walked through the valleys, as they sat amidst the prairie grasses, surrounded by the gentle hum of wings and the soft, lilting songs of birds.

In this tranquil oasis, they found a sense of peace, a sense of belonging to something greater than themselves. The world, with all its cares and sorrows, seemed to fade into the horizon, or reach beyond the sky, leaving only the gentle rustle of the wind, and the soft, golden light of the setting sun.

Ava turned to Elijah, her eyes shining with a deep, unspoken understanding. ""We could stay here,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the rustling of the grasses. ""We could stay here, and let the world just... fade away.""

Elijah's gaze met hers, his eyes burning with a deep, inner fire. ""We could,"" he replied, his voice low and husky. ""We could stay here, and let the stillness of the meadows heal our souls.""

And so they sat, surrounded by the peacefulness of the natural world, their hearts slowly healing from the wounds of the past. The city, with all its noise and chaos, seemed to recede into the distance, leaving only the gentle rustle of the wind, and the soft, golden light of the setting sun.

Only, outside the moisture stricken windows, was the veiled expanse. A small portion of the smog that filled the city sky was nudged over by a brief current. A single star, with its remote twinkle, hung above the city.

Elijah's eyes gazed out at the world, a world that seemed to be moving without him. He felt like a ghost, a spectral presence haunting the edges of his own life. The pain and fatigue had taken their toll.

As a result, he was forced to hide his struggles, to mask his pain and exhaustion behind a veneer of normalcy. It was a heavy burden to bear, one that left him feeling like he was drowning in a sea of uncertainty. Elijah's face, once a reflection of his bright, shining spirit, now seemed to whisper a single, haunting question: ""When will someone see me, and help me find my way?""

Ava's eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief as she sipped her coffee, her gaze drifting out the window to the rain-soaked streets.
Her dark hair was pulled back into a loose ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose. Her skin was sun-kisser.

Ava's past Born in Poland, she had spent many years studying in Eastern European countries, immersing herself in the rich history and literature of the region.
She spent a few years in North Africa for academics, which added a new layer of to her perspective. 

As they spent more time together, Ava found herself opening up to Elijah in ways she never had with anyone before. She shared with him her love of jazz, her fascination with the poetry of Jim Morrison, and her dreams of one day living in a secluded cabin surrounded by mountains and trees.
But despite the deepening connection between them, Ava's past continued to haunt her. She was hiding secrets, painful memories that she had kept locked away for years. Her silence was a shield, a protective barrier that she had forged around herself to keep the world at bay.

Elijah sensed the depth of Ava's pain, and it drew him to her even more. He saw in her a kindred spirit, a fellow traveler on the journey of life. And as they sat together in the quiet café, surrounded by the soft strains of jazz and the gentle patter of cutleries, the consistent yet shifting rhythms of the rain, Elijah knew that he had found a true connection in Ava.",1,1743643672.0,writingcritiques,1,1.0,False

School A is probably the perfect research fit for me, but the location is very far from ideal based on my taste. It is a rural, small town. I am not a partier, but I would like to live somewhere with things to do and where there is some life (or even just a variety of coffee shops, types of food, and some diversity). On top of this, the town is very expensive to live in and the stipend they are offering is not great for the COL. 

School B is not perfect, but still very good for my research. The city it is in is much better for my tastes and, when looking for apartments, I will be able to more easily afford living there (the stipend and benefits are also better). 

I am struggling with this because School A is literally perfect for my research, but I don't know if I would be happy there. I am hoping to keep connections with a professor at A who I have been speaking to, but I guess I worry she might judge me for picking a less perfect school since she was telling me how money is not the only factor for deciding a school and I should think about what kind of researcher I want to be  (maybe b/c she knows that the stipend is a bit low for the COL).

# [2025] Best Keyboard Covers: Top Picks & Reviews

Keyboard covers are essential accessories for protecting your valuable keyboards from spills, dust, and everyday wear and tear. With a wide variety of options available in 2025, selecting the right keyboard cover can be a daunting task. This article provides a complete review of the best keyboard covers on the market, highlighting their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles to help you make an informed decision. We’ll explore various materials, compatibility, and protective qualities to ensure your keyboard remains in pristine condition for years to come.

## Key Features Analysis

The best keyboard covers offer a blend of protection, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. Understanding the key features is crucial for choosing the right one for your specific needs.

**Material Quality:** The material used in a keyboard cover substantially impacts its durability, feel, and effectiveness. High-quality keyboard covers are typically made from either Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) or silicone. TPU offers excellent clarity and resistance to wear and tear, providing a rigid yet flexible protective layer. Silicone, conversely, is softer and more pliable, providing a comfortable typing experience and enhanced protection against spills.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with your specific keyboard model is paramount.Keyboard covers are often designed to precisely fit specific laptop or desktop keyboard layouts. Universal keyboard covers may offer broader compatibility but might not provide the same level of snug fit and protection. Before purchasing, double-check the product specifications to confirm compatibility with your keyboard's make and model number.

**Thickness and Openness:** The thickness of a keyboard cover affects both its protective capabilities and the typing experience. A thicker cover offers better protection against spills and dust but may slightly reduce the keyboard's tactile feedback. Transparency determines how clearly the keyboard's original keys are visible. High-transparency covers ensure that key legends are easily readable, while tinted or opaque covers may obscure the original keyboard markings.

**Anti-Slip Properties:** A good keyboard cover should stay firmly in place during use. Anti-slip properties, such as textured surfaces or adhesive strips, prevent the cover from sliding around on the keyboard. This is particularly critically important for frequent typists or users with angled keyboards. Secure placement ensures uninterrupted typing and consistent protection.

**Washability and Maintenance:** Keyboard covers inevitably accumulate dirt, dust, and fingerprints over time. Washable materials, such as silicone or TPU, allow for easy cleaning with soap and water. Some covers are even dishwasher-safe for convenient maintenance. Regular cleaning helps maintain hygiene and prolongs the lifespan of the keyboard cover.

**Tactile Feedback:** The best keyboard covers retain as much of the original keyboard's tactile feedback as possible. Thinner,form-fitting covers made from high-quality materials offer a more natural typing experience. Covers that are too thick or made from rigid materials can make typing feel mushy or unresponsive. Reviews from other users can offer insight into the how a cover impacts tactile feedback.

## Core Benefits

investing in a high-quality keyboard cover offers several practical benefits, safeguarding your keyboard and enhancing your overall user experience.**Protection Against Spills and Dust:** Keyboard covers provide a barrier against accidental spills of liquids like coffee, tea, or water, preventing potentially damaging fluids from reaching the keyboard's sensitive internal components. Similarly, they shield the keyboard from dust, crumbs, and other debris that can accumulate between the keys and impair functionality. This protection prolongs the lifespan of the keyboard and reduces the need for costly repairs or replacements.

**Prevention of Wear and Tear:** Regular typing can gradually wear down the keycaps, causing the letters and symbols to fade over time. Keyboard covers act as a protective layer, minimizing direct contact between your fingers and the keys. This helps preserve the original appearance of the keyboard and prevents the key legends from wearing off, maintaining its aesthetic appeal and usability.

**Improved Hygiene:** Keyboards can harbor a meaningful amount of bacteria and germs due to frequent contact with hands. Keyboard covers provide a smooth, non-porous surface that is easy to clean and sanitize.Regular cleaning of the cover helps maintain a hygienic typing environment and reduces the risk of spreading germs.

**Enhanced Typing Comfort:** Some keyboard covers, particularly those made from silicone, can enhance typing comfort by providing a soft, cushioned surface for your fingertips. This can be especially beneficial for users who spend long hours typing, as it reduces strain and fatigue on the fingers and wrists. The added tactile feedback can also improve typing accuracy and speed.

**Noise Reduction:** Keyboard covers can dampen the sound of typing, reducing noise levels in quiet environments such as offices, libraries, or shared workspaces. This can be particularly helpful for users who prefer a quieter typing experience or who work in close proximity to others. The noise reduction effect can also minimize distractions and improve focus.

## FAQs section

Here are some commonly asked questions about keyboard covers.

**Will a keyboard cover affect the typing experience?**
The effect on the typing experience depends on the material and thickness of the keyboard cover. Thinner, high-quality covers made from TPU or silicone generally have a minimal impact, preserving most of the original tactile feedback. Thicker or more rigid covers may make typing feel slightly diffrent, potentially requiring a bit of adjustment.

**Are keyboard covers washable?**
Most silicone and TPU keyboard covers are washable with mild soap and water.Some covers may even be dishwasher-safe,but it's essential to check the manufacturer's instructions before putting them in the dishwasher. Regular cleaning helps keep the cover hygienic and prolongs its lifespan.Always ensure the cover is completely dry before placing it back on the keyboard.

**How do I ensure the keyboard cover fits properly?**
The best way to ensure a proper fit is to check the product specifications carefully and confirm that the keyboard cover is designed for your specific keyboard model and layout. Look for covers that are advertised as being custom-fit or precisely molded for your keyboard. Universal covers may offer broader compatibility but might not provide the same level of snug fit and protection.

**Will a keyboard cover trap heat and damage my laptop?**
While some keyboard covers may slightly reduce airflow around the keyboard, they are generally designed to allow sufficient ventilation to prevent overheating. If you notice your laptop becoming excessively hot during use with a keyboard cover, it's advisable to remove the cover and monitor the temperature. Ensure that the laptop's vents are not obstructed.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

**Chapter 4**

Just a little bit of experimenting had made me pass out, so I should probably hold off. It could be dangerous.

*Psh. You’re going to let that stop you? Danger’s our middle name. What fun is life without danger?*

*Fiiiine, you make a good point. You win.*

*Wait, aren’t we the same person? So didn’t we both win?*

*Fine. We- I mean, I win?*

*Exactly.*

I convinced myself to experiment some more, but before I do, I text the only expert I know on spirituality and chakras.

 

**Hey Mom? What do the different chakras do?**

 

A few seconds later my screen lights up with a message.

**OMG! Are you interested? I can sign you up for my meditation class tomorrow!**

 

*Abort! Abort! Disaster approaching! Abort mission!* I hurriedly type out a response, but hesitate to send it. What if there are actually useful things to learn in a class like that?

Then I remember how boring those classes are, and send the text.

 

**No thanks. I’m good.**

 

I sit in my bed for a few seconds before my phone dings with a response.

 

**Aww. Too bad :(**

 

The three dots dance across the screen for a minute as my mom types. The phone vibrates as a large text comes in.

 

**First we have the root chakra that has to do with survival, life, death and our connection with the earth. Then there’s the sexual chakra (your dad’s favorite!). Third is our solar plexus, the power chakra. Fourth is your heart chakra (my favorite!) It stands for your connection with the earth, love, family and green growing things! Fifth is your throat chakra, which is for communication. Sixth is the third eye, which is perception or the sixth sense. Finally, there’s the crown chakra, our connection to god.**

**I hope that helped! I love you Elle.**

 

I send a quick message back saying that I love her too, then spend some time re-reading her message, trying to memorize it. My eyes automatically skip over her comments. If I don’t see them, they’re not real.

Thinking about all this reminds me of that book that Sheyla gave me before I left. Maybe I should open i-

*Wait. The gods that are supposedly “watching me” have been seeing nothing for the last half hour as I lay in bed and experiment with my psi. It’s positively uninteresting.*

*Oooh, good point! Maybe I can scare them off with more boring meditation and reading!*

I gleefully pull out the book that Sheyla gave me from my inventory. I open it to the first page.

**This is Sheyla’s Personal Book Of Spells! This book is currently analyzing your different magical energies to give you a large selection of personally curated spells, please wait a few moments before turning the page!**

The text disappears and is replaced with

**You may turn the page now.**

I shrug and follow the instructions.

**You can only use Psi (very sad)! Please state which of the energies you can use (only one sadly) that you would like to learn more about.**

“Hello strange book.” I say, my tone honey sweet. My smile is sharper than usual as I continue. “If you would be so kind as to show me psi. I’d appreciate it, and I definitely won’t cut you to ribbons for any snide comments. That would be cruel… and unusual. Very unladylike, you know?”

**You may turn the page now.**

I turn the page, and see a diagram of a female body with psi chakras clearly drawn. A flow chart of psi is shown, showing a strange circulation pattern, then it has brief descriptions of what simply increasing the speed of circulation in a certain area would do.

I study the page, then close my eyes, storing the book in my inventory. A meditative state comes to me quickly. I mentally trace the psi through my body.

Starting with my crown chakra, I grab my psi and guide it along the path the book recommended, connecting each chakra to the next.

I do this for a good while, keeping the flow to a regular speed. Once I feel comfortable with that, I focus on my third eye chakra.

I pull the psi there, guiding it and increasing the speed until it's a small whirlpool.

A strange sensation on my forehead draws me out of my meditation. I open my eyes and my vision shifts as the world takes on another hue of color.

I run over to the purse sitting on my nightstand. I don’t like mirrors, but it’s hard to do makeup without them, which is why I… there it is.

I pull out a small handheld mirror and stare at my reflection. A third eye actually looks back at me. The eye is blue with specks of green and the pupil is shaped like a cat’s pupil.

My door opens and I spin around. My mother looks at me with a smile. “Sorry Elle, I know you wanted some time to yourself, but Miss Elkins has been trying to get a hold of you.”

I tilt my head questioningly, but when my mom looks confused, I shrug. “Thanks.”

I expected her to comment on the whole Third Eye thing, but she acts as if she can’t even see it.

She gives me one last curious look before leaving the room.

So only I can see the Eye.

A blue screen pops up and I look down at it.

 

**You have learned the spell \[Eye Of Truth\]**

 

“What does \[Eye Of Truth\] do?” I ask.

Another blue screen pops up.

 

**\[Eye Of Truth\] allows you to see all that is being hidden from you. It is a passive skill that requires your Third Eye to be open in order for it to work.**

 

So it’s invisible, but I can see it in the mirror because it lets me see the invisible. Makes sense.

My mind finally catches up with what my mom had been telling me, and I sigh.

I pull out my phone, and see that Miss Elkins had, in fact, been trying to get ahold of me. School seems so… unimportant when I have a literal third eye.

I sigh as I unlock my phone and start her voicemail.

“Hi Elena! This is Miss Elkins, I was hoping you could show a new girl around school tomorrow. Her name is Rose, and she just transferred over from California. I’m sure she could use a friend. Do you think you could show her the proverbial ‘ropes’? I know this is last minute, but I know I can count on you. Please text me.”

I smile at her wording, then text her that I can meet the other girl. She responds immediately with a thumbs up, then texts me to meet the girl in the school office.

I close my phone. A sound from outside my window draws my attention, My father closes the door to his car, and walks towards the door. I can’t help the smile that spreads across my face.

With a skip in my step, I leave my room. I practically run down the stairs, reaching the front door just as my dad opens it.

His tired expression shifts as he catches sight of me, breaking into a wide smile. “Hey Elle. Is your mom here? Today was a… long one.”

My father’s shoulders sag slightly, but they still hold the wiry strength of a healthy lifestyle. He might be 52 years old now, but he has the strong brown eyes and curly brown hair that made my mom fall in love with him.

“She’s home.” I give him a hug, and feel as he relaxes. “Another gang shooting?” I ask as I let go.

“Two in a row.” He kicks off his shoes and walks to the couch. He collapses with a loud sigh. “Something’s going on, but no one knows what.”

“I’ll go get mom.”

He nods slightly, his eyes already closed.

I walk into the kitchen where mom is stirring some pasta sauce. “Hey mom? Dad’s home. He looks like he could use you.”

She pauses as she looks at me, “Is it bad?”

I nod.

She lets go of the ladle and walks towards the living room. “Could you start the noodles while I check up on him?”

“Sure thing.” I say to her back, but she’s already gone.

 

\*\*\*

 

A loud noise wiggles its way through my half asleep mind.

I slam the alarm clock with the back of my hand, then turn to grumble into my pillow. With a groan, I push myself up and blow my hair out of my eyes. I stretch and yawn, working out all the kinks in my back.

There’s less aching than usual. Ever since I leveled up, I’ve been feeling better physically, and my mind has been clearer. The voices are still there though.

I glance at my gloves, where they sit on the nightstand. I’ll grab them later, when I’m not half-asleep.

I force myself through my morning ritual. I shower, brush my teeth and apply some basic makeup. By the end of it, I feel human again.

I walk down the stairs to find my dad reading the newspaper in the kitchen.

“Anything interesting happen?” I cover a yawn as I pull out some eggs and get to cracking.

“Ha! They’re at it again! Every day, it’s another exaggeration or half-assed story. And when it turns out that they’re wrong, they barely even apologize. Look at this!” He shows me a clipping that I look at from the corner of my eye.

I start some toast, flip the eggs, then give him a knowing smile. “News is a business, whatcha gonna do?”

“Knowing is doing something.” He grumbles.

I finish the eggs and toast, then grab two plates. I set one in front of both my dad and me.

“Thanks Elle.”

“No problem dad.” I sit down across from him. “I’m going to be running to school today. I promised to meet someone early.”

“I was wondering what you were doing up so early.” He says around a bite of toast. “Want a ride? Elizabeth is still at her sleepover.”

I shake my head as I eat.

I do my best to not rush my meal. Once I’m finished, I grab my backpack and head towards the door.

“Have fun at school Elle!”

“When is school not fun?” I yell back at him as I open the door.

My dad’s laughter is cut off as I close the door. I put my earbuds in, select a rock song, and start running.

My steps match the beat of the song, as I fall into a rhythm.

I’d had a little time before bed last night, and I’d played around with one other spell listed in Sheyla’s book. Using the psi in the power chakra in my stomach, I’d learned to cast \[Unmatchable Speed\].

It does what it sounds like, making my body move at a speed I can barely follow with my eyes. It used up a good chunk of my psi, but I’d gotten it back fairly quickly. It seems useful, but it’s a little much for my morning run, so instead I just lightly rotate the psi of my power chakra, noticing how my steps seem to have slightly more power to them.

I follow the sidewalk to the parking lot of my highschool and slow down as I get to the main office.

I stop outside of the building to catch my breath. My water bottle comes in clutch and I drink greedily. My running had managed to keep the chill air away, but now that I’d stopped, I can see the mist coming from my breath.

I put my water bottle away and enter the office.

“Do you need something Elena?” The lady at the front desk calls out.

I put on my best smile as I walk over to her. “Yeah, I’m looking for a girl named Rose?”

“That’s me.” A voice says from behind me.

I turn around to look at the transfer student.

She’s a pretty girl, with shoulder length pink hair, and blue eyes. My eyes are immediately drawn to the small piercing in the corner of her mouth as she gives me a small smile.

I return her smile, “I’m Elena. It’s good to meet you.” I hold out my hand.

She looks surprised by the gesture, but shakes my hand all the same. “Rose, but you knew that. I hear you’re my tour guide?”

“That’s me.”

“Great! I was worried I’d be left waiting here.” She turns around, walking towards her backpack.

The little short-skirt sways back and forth, attracting my attention.

She looks back at me, “Are you coming?”

“Yep! So what do you want to see first?” I walk over to her.

“Well, it would be nice to see my homeroom first…”

“Of course!” I knock on my head. “Sorry, must’ve lost my mind there for a second. Follow me.” I head towards the elevators. “As Juniors, we’re lucky enough to get the second floor mostly to ourselves…” I start as I lead her.

Rose is an interesting girl. That’s for sure. The entire time I’m with her, she keeps a polite, but “I don’t want you to get too close to me” face on. She dodges any personal questions like an olympic athlete would dodge rocks.

What I find most odd though, is the fact that she intrigues me so much. I mean, I just discovered how to read someone’s mind and look into the secrets of the universe, yet I can’t seem to get the girl out of my mind.

Maybe there’s something I’m missing? Maybe she has something to do with The System™ and I’m subconsciously realizing it?

No, that doesn’t seem right either.

How odd.

I roll through the rest of my classes in a haze of thought. It’s only when the bell rings that I realize why I’d been so distracted. Mrs. Everheart, the exchange student in middle school, and now this new girl…

I’m gay.

Oh nice, now that that’s over with, I can continue my life in a normal manner.

I say goodbye to the couple of people I usually hang out with as the bell rings. With a little bit of time left in the day, I decide to head towards a cute little coffee shop close to the school.

As I leave the school, I notice Rose walking in the same direction as me. She gazes at the sky, her steps meandering.

“Where are you heading?” I ask, matching pace with her.

She jumps, her hand moving to her purse before she recognizes me. “Jesus. You scared me.” She gives me a genuine smile.

“Sorry. Are you okay?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Just deep in thought.”

“What’s on your mind?” I ask,

“Just about life. It has the strangest twists sometimes, y’know?” She sighs in an exaggerated manner and looks up at me.

“I get the feeling.” A car passes us by and we grow quiet.

The silence is surprisingly comfortable, and I see a small smile on her face as we walk.

“You never did answer my question.”

“What question?” Rose gives me a confused look as we stop at a traffic light.

The pedestrian sign shows the little green man, allowing us to go. We walk across, entering a fancy district with lots of empty office buildings.

“Where are we going?” I ask.

“We? When did I invite you?” The small smile on her face takes the sting out of her words.

“You didn’t. I invited myself.” I say, then pause. A harsh feeling of being watched makes me shiver and I turn my gaze to the large industrial building

“I don’t think that’s the way that works. But-”

I grab her arm, stopping her mid sentence.

She watches me curiously, but I ignore her as I close my eyes and accelerate my throat chakra’s psi. My thoughts push out of my body, moving through the buildings. They’re mostly empty, and I brush across only a few minds. One quickly stands out to me.

*Come on, just a little further. I promise it’ll be over quick.* The thoughts come from the building just a little down the street. I look through eyes that watch us through a scope.

I open my eyes, my hand tightening on Rose's arm. My psi accelerates as I activate \[Unmatchable Speed\]. I jump at Rose, wrap my arms around her and push both of us behind an office building.

Gunshots fire, and I feel an impact on my back.

We land on the dirt behind the building.

Rose shoves me off of her, and I yelp from pain.

She curses, looking me over. “Elena?! Are you okay?”

I move my hand over to my shoulder, and pull it back to see it covered in blood. I smile up at her. “It’s just a flesh wound?”

“Shit.” Rose says.

An apt expletive.

A shock of pain makes its way through my shoulder and arm as I move, distracting me from my thoughts.

My gloves have healing abilities, I’ll just put them on- I left them on my nightstand, didn’t I?

I’m a 215lbs M, I went from 260 to 215 from fasting and now i kind forgot how it goes but i started again & remembered ADF was the best by FAR for me. This is what I did;

1. Fast 48 hours. 
2. Have an eating window (however long I want tbh, typically 3-6 hours, spread out.) 
3. Eat ANYTHING below my maintenance. (I pigged out so hard today but I’m so ready to reset for the next two day, always below maintenance though.)
4. Window closes. Back to zero cal drinks, a coffee in the morning and a poop-load of water. 
5. Repeat as the weight goes down. (Able to keep it off too)

Only downside that I’m starting to remember is energy levels. I don’t take supplements, I probably will start though… eventually. 

Last thing; someone once said, if you’re overweight, just eat less. lol. 

If you can’t do two days, build the willpower to do 24 hours, and have a 1 hour eating window below 1000 calories. I’m no doctor, but it works wonders!
