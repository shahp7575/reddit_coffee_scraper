Wrong Place, Wrong Time

\~Joan\~

“This place is... wow,” I muttered as we entered the house, it had floor to ceiling windows, a fireplace and....well, it was perfect.

But something felt slightly off.

“So... how did you know about this place?” I asked Rhoda, who sat on the couch while I walked towards the window and stared down at the view of Spain.

“Well, this is one of Aaron's properties,” she chuckled. I nodded, then paused.

My stomach dropped. What?

“He doesn’t know we're here. I have the spare keys to the building. I mean, why ask when I can just walk in?” Rhoda said, glancing at me with a small smile on her face.

“This is Aaron's house?” I asked slowly. She turned around fully, raising a brow at me.

“Yeah, it’s his.” Her voice was quiet. ""What is it?""

I pinched the bridge of my nose, disbelief washing over me. The fuck?

“I can't believe you brought me to Aaron's house of all places,” I muttered. For God's sake, she knows what her brother was like and still she went ahead and brought me to his house?

Rhoda sat up straighter, her smile falling.

“Exactly why I said he has no idea we’re here. Jo, your feud with my brother is seriously getting ridiculous.”

“Oh, really? You think this is ridiculous?” I snapped, crossing my arms. “Have you forgotten the time we both landed in jail and he bailed you out, leaving me there to rot?”

Rhoda opened her mouth to speak, but I cut her off. “Or the time we crashed his party, and guess who got blamed for that? Me! He called me a bad influence, told me to stop dragging you into ‘bad things.’ He acts like I’m the villain in your life.” I gritted my teeth.

“Jo...” Rhoda trailed off.

“And now you bring me to his house? You really think I won’t get blamed for this too?” I asked. If I had known, I wouldn't have followed her.

Okay maybe, I still would have. I mean who would turn down a trip to Spain? But we would have booked a hotel room.

Not here. Not this.

Rhoda stood up and turned around the couch, walking towards me.

I’m wrong and I'm really sorry. I didn’t think. I just wanted us to enjoy our girls' trip, and this house is... well, it’s perfect.” She gestured around the house, but I barely glanced at it. “I should have talked to you about it. You’re right.”

I let out a sigh.

""What next?"" I asked and her shoulders sagged.

""Well, we could still stay here. He doesn’t know we're here. So...."" she wringled her fingers together.

""We could still leave if you want,"" she added.

""If he doesn't know we're here we could stay,"" I muttered. Well, he wouldn't just pop up in Spain now, would he?

Rhoda grinned, and I could see the relief on her face.

“We're not gonna stay inside all day now or are we?"" She asked, a glint in her eyes. I pursed my lips.

“Please tell me we’re going to see Barcelona,” She added as she grabbed my hand, and she nodded a little too fast.

“Of course! We would,"" I muttered as we dragged our luggage to the room were we would be staying.

Despite all that Rhoda had said, I still felt slightly uncomfortable. Knowing the house belonged to Aaron just didn't sit right with me.

And hell, I knew something was bound to go wrong. Wherever the man was concerned, something always went wrong.

After freshening up, we decided to explore the neighborhood. At least, we should familiarize ourselves with the vicinity since we'd be staying for a month.

“Tomorrow, we'll go see the Tower, yeah?,” Rhoda asked as we walked back after wandering through a few blocks.

I gave a small nod.

Rhoda sighed and tipped her head back, feeling the cool evening breeze wash over her face, she closed her eyes, a small smile playing on her face.

“It’s nice to breathe fresh air outside of New York,” she sighed. I glanced over at her and followed her lead, raising my head and staring at the dark sky.

Rhoda suddenly opened her eyes, and stared at me. I could see the mischievous glint in them.

“The first one back to the house gets a paid manicure at the fanciest salon in the city!” she said, and before I could process what she said, she darted off.

A laugh escaped me as I ran after her. But oh boy, the girl was goddamn fast.

Who knows? Maybe I would enjoy this trip after all.

We stumbled into the compound and Rhoda pushed the door open stepping in.

I followed after her but she stopped abruptly that I crashed into her back.

""What's it?"" I whispered as the color drained from her face.

She remained silent and I peeked at the inside from over her shoulder.

And there he was, in the living room, swirling a glass of something dark. Whiskey maybe.

His eyes were cold and his expression closed off as he finished the last of his drink, slamming the glass on the table.

I was surprised it didn't shatter. Rhoda shuddered lightly while a small frown crept up my face.

Aaron.

The devil had arrived.

# Caught In The Middle

\~Joan\~

Everywhere was silent. No one said a word, we just stared at each other. For a minute, or two?

But that did nothing to ease the hard expression on Aaron's face. His eyes just darted between us.

How is he here? How did he even know we were here? Rhoda had insisted he didn’t have a clue—she hadn’t even told him.

“Rhoda...” His voice was low and cold, just as it had always been. He wasn't one to talk much, but once he did, it carried a certain confidence. “Care to explain what you're doing in 'my' house, without my permission?”

Rhoda was silent. If I didn’t know her so well, I might’ve believed the man across from us wasn’t her brother. Seven years wasn’t much of a gap, but Aaron made it seem like a big deal.

He made everything seem like a big deal.

His gaze moved to me, and I mentally braced myself for what I knew was coming next.

“And you,” he muttered, his tone grew a little bit colder. I could practically sense his annoyance. “Still following my sister around, I see.”

“Okay. Before you get this all wrong, I had no idea this was your house,” I said quietly, elbowing Rhoda.

This was not the time for her to stay fucking silent.

“No idea?” He interrupted, standing up. And oh boy, the man was on the taller side.

His height could be imposing at times too.

""You want me to believe this wasn't your idea?"" He asked and I pressed my lips together.

There we go.

I drew in a deep breath, ignoring the annoyance already building inside of me.

“Like I said, I had no idea this house belonged to you until we were here,"" I muttered.

And Rhoda still remained silent.

""And whose idea was it?"" He asked, his eyes not leaving me.

""Maybe if you weren't such a controlling bastard, your sister would have told you we were going to use your house,” I bit out.

Okay. If Rhoda wasn't going to speak, I wasn’t going to keep silent and take the blame for something I knew nothing about.

Rhoda’s eyes darted from me to her brother. She dreaded him.

Aaron took a step toward me, his eyes grew darker. Rhoda raised her hand, stepping in front of me.

“Aaron, stop—please,” she said quietly. “She's right. This was my idea. Don’t take it out on her.”

She took a step closer to him while I took one step backward.

“You’ve always been trouble, Joan. From the very first moment I saw you, I knew you'd be trouble,” his voice had a chill to it.

I clenched my fists, resisting the urge to go all out on him. I was in his house after all.

“You know what?” I said after a while, taking a step forward and meeting his glare head-on.

“Fuck. You.” I raised my middle finger, thrusting it in his face before storming off toward the room where we’d kept our bags.

There was no way I was letting Aaron ruin the one vacation I’d had in a year. I was going to enjoy my trip—without his godforsaken, insufferably handsome face hovering around.

I yanked my clothes out of the closet, shoving them into my bag in quick movements.

I didn’t care that it was late; I would find a hotel and spend the night somewhere else, anywhere but here.

From the hallway, I heard Rhoda’s muffled yells—she’d finally shaken off the shock, but I didn’t care anymore.

“Aaron, don’t you dare! You can’t keep being a jackass to her every time she’s around!”

Her voice grew closer, footsteps approached as I zipped my bag shut, ready to leave.

The door swung open, and there they were—Aaron just standing there and Rhoda behind him, looking exasperated.

Their gazes flicked to my packed bag, and Rhoda’s eyes turned glassy as she took a step forward.

“Jo...” she whispered, her voice breaking.

I looked at her, ignoring Aaron completely.

“Just so you know,” I said calmly, “your brother is an asshole. And yeah, I’ll text you my address in the morning.”

I stepped forward, waiting for them to move out of my way.

Aaron’s voice stopped me.

“You’re not leaving at this time of night,” he said, not a statement, but an order.

I stared at him, hoping the daggers in my eyes could pierce him to death.

It would hurt Rhoda... But it was worth the try.

“No,” I said annoyed. “You don’t get to dictate what I do.”

His jaw tightened, and a flicker of something dark crossed his face.

“Try me, Joan. See if I won’t drag you back here myself. And trust me, it isn't something you'd enjoy,” he muttered, and somehow the threat sent warmth curling in my lower belly.

Damn him.

“You’re going to leave in the morning,” he continued. “I’m not letting you storm off in anger and end up getting murdered somewhere, not like it would affect me. And besides...” He glanced at Rhoda. “We still need to talk.”

With that, he turned and left the room. I blinked at Rhoda, stunned.

“Did he just threaten me?” I asked.

Rhoda stepped forward, throwing her arms around me.

“I’m sorry, Jo,” she whispered, her voice breaking slightly. “I never meant for this to happen. I shouldn’t have dragged you into this.”

I sighed, wrapping my arms around her.

“It’s not entirely your fault,” I murmured.

As much as I hated her brother, I couldn’t deny that he was disgustingly handsome.

“Just stay for the night,” Rhoda pleaded. “Please.”

I sighed again.

“Fine. I’ll stay,” I muttered. I wasn’t staying because of Aaron’s thinly veiled warning or the strange warmth his threat had sparked in me.

I was staying because Rhoda asked me to.

Not because of Aaron. Definitely not because of him.

# Before The Weekend

\~Aaron\~

I was an early riser... Or maybe that was the wrong word to use. I had insomnia, so sleeping was a problem.

Which explained why I was in the kitchen by 4 a.m., fully dressed in my usual outfit—a suit—brewing coffee. I walked into the sitting room, glancing at the windows. It was already dawn. The sky was glowing red, a warning of the day ahead.

Soon enough, the girls would be awake. Speaking of ""girls""... I took a sip of my coffee before walking toward the window, staring down at the quiet city, save for a few cars and early risers moving like ghosts through the streets.

I’d had a business meeting in Barcelona, which explained why I was in Spain. I was supposed to be finishing up by the weekend and returning to New York on Monday. I should’ve been thinking about work, logistics, my schedule. But I wasn’t.

No, I was thinking about what I’d come back to—my house invaded by my sister and her best friend.

Rhoda always had a streak of stubbornness in her, but it never flared into anything unmanageable. Until she met Joan. I had to give Joan credit for pulling Rhoda out of her grief after our parents died. But Joan didn’t stop there. She had a way of encouraging the wild, reckless side of my sister, feeding it like gasoline to a flame.

And the fact that Joan hated me? Well, that was just a bonus. I overheard her once telling Rhoda that I always looked like I had a stick up my ass. She’d go out of her way to ignore me or start an argument—anything to get under my skin.

And damn if it didn’t work.

I didn’t even realize how long I’d been standing there, staring out at nothing, my coffee growing cold. A movement in the house snapped me back. My body tensed, instinctively alert.

The house was big enough for all of us to avoid each other, but I could sense her. Joan. I wasn’t even looking, but I could feel her presence, the heat of her gaze boring into my back.

Closer, closer, until the room fell into that particular kind of silence that only she could create. I didn’t turn around.

She didn’t speak. She just moved past me, toward the fireplace, her movements slow and deliberate, like she had all the time in the world. I eventually turned and pinned her with a cool, assessing look.

Her ginger-red hair was piled into a messy bun on top of her head, strands escaping to frame her face. She closed her eyes, soaking in the warmth of the fire, her lashes dark against her pale skin. Those eyes, when they opened, were sharp and cunning—like a fox’s.

I moved to the island that separated the kitchen from the dining area, annoyed at myself for noticing things about her I had no business noticing. The quiet between us was thick, tense.

She stood, her movements unhurried, and walked toward me. Our eyes met—green on black—before she quickly glanced away. My gaze followed her, against my better judgment, lingering on the way her sleep shirt clung to her body, the curve of her legs in those damn shorts that barely reached mid-thigh.

She looked good in the morning, like she always did. Too good.

“If you’re done ogling me, move out of my way,” she said, her voice flat, eyes narrowed in a scowl.

I raised the mug to my mouth, taking a sip of bitter, cold coffee, eyes still on her. “This is my house,” I replied, matching her tone. “I can’t be in your way.”

Her scowl deepened, her eyes flashing with something sharper than anger. For anyone else, the look she gave me would have been enough to send them running. But not me.

She squared her shoulders, lifting her chin as if daring me to back down. I didn’t. She wasn’t tall enough to reach my height, not even on her best day, but she didn’t need height to hold her ground.

Fists clenched, lips flattened into a hard line, her whole body practically vibrating with the effort it took not to lash out. It didn’t take much to rile her up, especially if it was coming from me.

She let out a sharp huff, her gaze slicing away from mine as she moved around the island, heading for the kitchen. I didn’t turn to follow, but I knew exactly what she was doing.

Joan Madison wasn’t a morning person without her coffee. In that way, at least, we were alike.

My sister, Rhoda, appeared a moment later, her chestnut hair a wild mess, her eyes heavy with sleep.

I knew both girls slept in the same room and on the same bed. Leaving me wondering why Joan looked like that and Rhoda —like this.

She mumbled a groggy, “Morning,” as she brushed past me and stood next to Joan, who wordlessly handed her a mug.

Rhoda smiled, leaning into Joan’s shoulder as she took a sip. The sight nearly made me roll my eyes.

Rhoda turned to me, noticing that I hadn’t responded to her greeting. Her brow furrowed in confusion, and she just stared at me for a beat too long.

“We’re leaving today,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. My stomach twisted into a knot at her words. Joan didn’t even spare me a glance.

I checked my watch, taking a long stride toward the couch, my mind already racing. “Stay,” I said, my tone flat, almost indifferent.

Rhoda’s eyes widened in surprise, her sleepy expression disappearing as she processed what I’d said. “I’ll be leaving by the weekend,” I added, grabbing my suitcase.

I glanced at Joan, just long enough to catch her tense posture, before I turned back to Rhoda. She looked like she was caught between confusion and mild guilt, but Joan? Joan’s expression didn’t waver. If anything, she seemed more irritated.",1,1747397892.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

(29F),"**Oh boy**, todays the day, I remember 7 months ago thinking 'will I ever make one of those recovery posts?'. Know how important it is for people suffering to hear of success stories, I've been there and reading that it gets better was one of the only motivations to get through each day of hell. Hope this helps someone, at the very least to give hope or feel seen, and hopefully some tips for recovery and what not to waste time with.

Will use bullet points as this post is LONG, but feel free to stalk my history for the past 7 months if you want to see all the attempted routes of diagnosis (Guillain Barre syndrome, hemiplegic migraines, POTS etc). 

**Timeline and symptoms:**

\- whiplash/concussion injury in **October 2024**: still unsure if this was the trigger or not, but symptoms of dizziness, nausea and vertigo began shortly after, then numbness starting in my feet then moving up my body and eventually whole body dysregulation. *The injury was not extreme, I didn't pass out, and didn't realise I had concussion*

\- symptoms: vertigo, blackout vision, vibrating eyes, numb legs and arms, drop foot (where my left leg would slam on the floor and drag), slurred speech, numb left side of face, numb tongue, firm grip at back of neck, swaying sensation, saddle paralysis for 5 days (couldn't use sphincter muscles), moving neck down caused intense nausea and shooting pains down my spine, moving head left and right gave nausea too, finger and toes muscle spasms/jolts, nerve shooting pains, dizziness (to point of vomiting), vibrating legs and arms, one pupil would be bigger than the other, palpitations, pallor, serious brain fog (acting 'drugged'), muscle cramps, tingley/pins and needles, tension headaches, sensitivity to light, general weakness, couldn't look at screens or even make sense of TV shows, sleep apnea, general nervous system dysregulation, zombie-like fatigue, heartrate would go from 60 to 140 climbing a few stairs. Then the longer symptoms went on I started to get derealisation, panic attacks, sudden depression (it felt like someone had injected me with suicidal thoughts, most bizarre sudden shift I've ever experienced, it felt chemical and out of my control, realising now this was likely due to concussion)

\- would get what I called 'episodes' which were kind of like... stroke-like soft seizures? Anything from minutes to hours of the above symptoms but *intensified*. I would feel myself slipping into one and nod goodbye to reality for however long. I find it hard to even type up the feeling as they were so horribly scary. Would happen between 1 and 5 times a day, often lasting all night. After the first 20 or so, I knew they wouldn't kill me, but the first few were the most frightened I've ever been. I remember laying on the floor at 2am one night unable to feel my face and legs, getting nerve pains all over my body thinking, *well, this is how I die!*

\- couldn't even brush my hair without dizziness, was showering in a chair for a portion of this, couldn't go for a walk round the block without holding onto someones arm, couldn't sit in a cafe or restaurant because the pressure on my spine from being in a chair would trigger symptoms, couldn't move my eyes without feeling I'd fall over, my legs were so numb and weak that my ankles would swing into each other, couldn't watch TV (I remember having such bad brain fog I couldn't make sense of what I was seeing, seeing images didn't convert into anything), couldn't sit on a sofa, couldn't rest my head on a pillow for 4 months, had to sleep with my fist under my temple, or sleep upright, or not sleep at all. would wake up every morning with numb legs, unable to roll my ankles / move my feet with ease, felt like gravity was tripled. **Important note: most of these symptoms would resolve if I got into a cobra position on my stomach, with my neck held up. This is the only way I kept my job, working on the floor in that position!  This was also a vital piece of information that proved my symptoms were likely mechanical and to do with the neck injury.** If I put a pillow under my neck, symptoms would intensify. Moving my head/neck was very clearly the issue. It would feel like a fluttering at the back of my head, as if the blood flow stopped, and I'd go super pale and then start zoning out.

\- focus for Oct/Nov/Dec when symptoms were at their worst tbh was just getting through each day and trying to get medical help in brief moments of lucidity, to rule out nasty things. My experience at hospitals throughout that period has lowkey traumatised me for life lol, I spent countless days trying to advocate for myself (whilst in a *terrible* state - and my partner at the time was not very proactive in helping effectively/being supportive - to have someone really advocate for you makes a world of difference I think) and got no closer to understanding what was wrong, largely dismissed. I then deteriorated pretty rapidly in December, which is when I started showering in a chair and was unable to even sit at a table. Most of my time was spent groaning laying down, being out of it, couldn't use a phone or laptop for more than 10 mins. Bit of a blur now. Mentioning this because those weeks I would (when able to read) search desperately for recovery stories on here and want to say to anyone in that position now, I've been there, **it DOES get better.** I was firing DM's off to anyone I could find with similar symptoms, comparing notes, researching, buying every bloody supplement under the sun, commenting on posts from 10 years ago asking for updates. Jan/Feb were bad but I had given up on medical help, and was self treating at home as best as I could. March in hindsight I hit breaking point and couldn't cope anymore, so then Mar/Apr/May I devoted to seeing as many doctors as possible again.

**Tests and appointments (NHS and private):**

Saw multiple neurologists, a cardiologist, physiotherapists, osteopaths, a chiropractor, even contacted a hypnotherapist at a desperate point, a rheumatologist, multiple physical therapists (massage), acupuncturist, and around 10 GPs. Had full spine MRI, brain MRI, positional MRIs (with rotation, flexion, extension), ECG, X-ray, nerve conduction studies, all the bloods, positional MRA, doppler ultrasound -- **every single test came back normal** (bar a benign brain tumour which is unrelated to all of this apparently, and bar having hypermobility confirmed with the rotational MRIs). I sought care in France, Spain, Argentina and the UK - was calling doctors abroad ready to travel to anyone who could help.

I dread to think what all of the above totalled financially and refuse to do that maths!!! But I remember thinking I would give my life savings to feel better so it's fine...

**Avenues explored and misdiagnosis:**

Ruled out MS and cauda equina syndrome with the first batch of scans. TIAs were considered but the 'seizures'/episodes happened so often that TIAs were unlikely. Won't list all the failed paths but will mention a few that perhaps others here might have considered. First misdiagnosis was **BPPV** (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), did the Epley manouver for a week with no improvement. I then was diagnosed with 'mild **Guillain Barre syndrome**' in January, several months after symptom onset, due to the timeline matching GBS and the paralysis/numbness that began in my feet and moved up my body, as well as symptoms starting after a bad tummy bug. \[I'm still unsure if it was GBS, there was no way to test after missing the boat for IVIg treatment, maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but the way I've cured symptoms suggests it was a biomechanical cause from my neck rather than an autoimmune problem!\] They also tried suggesting it was FND, which I aggressively contested, as I felt this was a fob off diagnosis, especially as my symptoms were so positionally triggered, I was convinced there was a mechanical/structural cause in my neck. POTS was a candidate but couldn't account for symptoms persisting even when I lay down. The overwhelming takeaway from every specialist visit was that dizziness coupled with strange neuropathic symptoms is INCREDIBLY COMMON, often correlates with a neck issue, but docs DO NOT KNOW how to help most people and have little understanding of cervical instability. I don't regret seeking help, but I do wish I hadn't had such hope each time I turned up to an appointment. Largely the same advice from all of them: ""we don't know how to help you, the body is complicated, focus on what works at home"", and if I tried to steer towards cervical instability (or indeed any other theory), they were patronising and annoyed that I had looked into this. I obviously understand they are the expert, but honestly, most of the neurologists were *so* inept and would say contradictory things to each other, so I lost a lot of faith on that front.

**What I tried:**

Trialled more than I can remember but off the top of my head: Propranolol for palpitations/black-outs, valium/diazepam (was careful with this), high dose ibuprofen + paracetamol, various other NSAIDs (was living in countries where I could get some pretty heavy stuff easily), anti inflammatory gels, hemp, physiotherapy, daily yoga, massage guns, TENS machine, went gluten free, gave up coffee, wore compression stockings day and night, daily B12, B6, B9, high iron, vitamin C, vitamin D, tumeric, curcumin, black pepper, lions mane, high dose magnesium, omega 3, co q10, high salt high water diet, gave up alcohol, ate VERY healthy, acupuncture, daily meditation, heat/cold therapy, massage therapy, rest (eg keeping my neck still for a day), exercise/keeping moving constantly, wore a neck brace, neck strengthening exercises.

\[Wanted to rule out pre-existing conditions as the cause too, as I have autoimmune thyroid issues, anaemia, POTS and some other stuff, so started high iron, got my thyroid in to an optimal range, but symptoms persisted\]

**My symptoms today:**

Haven't had a full blown 'seizure'/episode in weeks, I do still get 'flare ups' of a fuzzy grip at the back of my head, as well as brief hours of low level numbness down my right arm and legs and face, but I'm no longer permanently dizzy, no longer nauseous, no longer having vertigo, no longer unable to walk/cycle/drive. I cycled a bike for an hour last month, I did a 2h drive by myself, I am sleeping with A PILLOW AGAIN (this is the biggest thing oh my GOD), able to shower and dry my hair without symptoms. Able to sit on the sofa, work on my laptop, watch a movie, play piano, cook dinner, make a cup of tea --- all things I absolutely *could not do* a couple of months ago. Nothing is wasted on me, I catch myself with my neck down chopping vegetables and start grinning!! Still maybe 30-60 minutes a day total of very very mild symptoms, as I type this I'm feeling a little fuzzy, and don't think I'm well enough yet to start running or moving my neck around fast, but my quality of life is almost back to what it was.

**So, what helped?**

It's hard to say what of what I attempted has helped, as I did a lot of them in tandem. The biggest piece of advice and guidance I can give is that, even if you follow this list perfectly, it may simply be a matter of patience. I lived like a f\*\*\*ing monk for months, with zero improvements. It seems my body needed 5-6 months to recover, and perhaps I could have shaved a month off that, but really do think **TIME is part of this equation. You have to trust that it will end.**

Some of these may be red herrings but my view is I'll continue with it all if it's low risk with high potential gain, so this is what I've stuck with:

\- **Weekly release work from a physio/massage therapist** for my traps and deep neck muscles. ***MUSCLE RELEASE WORK HAS HAD THE SINGLE BIGGEST IMPACT.*** They pull my skull up and reduce compression in the neck, and then prod around massaging the tender muscles. I've learnt how to do this on myself too, and get my dad to do it for me, which really really helps during a flare up. Basically just pulling up from the base of the skull and massaging the back/sides of my neck and shoulders. Often deep massaging triggers symptoms afterwards for a day but overall is VERY beneficial. Also realising I'm carrying tension there has helped, just noticing throughout the day my shoulders are tight and taking a breath, releasing and relaxing. Muscle guarding happens around injuries, so the theory is my neck has been guarding the soft tissue damage I got from the neck injury, which actually compresses everything and the inflammation/crowding can trigger nerves, causing numbness or autonomic dysregulation. \[I know there's a lot of bullshit online around calming the vagus nerve etc, but honestly, this explanation is the one that fits best\]. I think if I had started massage therapy (either at home on myself or from a professional) early on, maybe I could have skipped a month or two of suffering.

\- Daily gentle yoga and stretching, when my body allows

\- **GENTLE** neck strengthening exercises. I saw **no improvements** from the violent ones that would trigger symptoms (like face down into armpit), but did see improvement once I focused on exercises that required little movement, such as placing my palm against my cheek and pushing with resistence. Think I was doing too much at first, and needed to build strength.

\- Magnesium before bed

\- Co Q10

\- High dose B vitamins (B12, B9 etc)

\- Lions mane tablets

\- Propranolol 10-40mg daily (helps with dizziness, blackout vision and palpitations)

\- Vit C

\- Lots and lots of water

\- Compression stockings helps with lightheadedness and blackouts

\- Valium for emergency days: do NOT take more than one in a 72h period or you'll get addicted. I took 10 pills in total over the span of 7 months, for days where I *had* to be functioning. It almost eradicated my symptoms, I presume due to the muscles relaxing in my neck, reducing compression/inflammation. Also hugely helped with the inevitable health anxiety alongside all this!

\- ""Nervous system calming"". This ones hard, because it requires reflecting on lifestyle and the people you have around you. I was in a relationship with someone who, at their best, was helping with every-day tasks like cooking and listening, but unfortunately at their worst was an absent supporter and not at all proactive or forthcoming with advocacy, and admitted they resented the physical state I was in. This, I realise in hindsight, hindered my recovery *massively*. To feel safe, believed and supported is **REALLY** important. \[No shade on them, they were doing what they could with what they had, but worth mentioning... As soon as I was physically away from them, I improved much much much faster\]. I also was completely isolated from friends and family due to being largely unable to use my phone or laptop for prolonged periods, and had no capacity for anything remotely social, because I was so symptomatic. I found myself stopping talking to anyone because I didn't know how to put into words how badly I was suffering ('dizzy' sounds so benign) and became very, very lonely. If I could go back, I'd have asked for help from family a lot sooner!!

\- High dose iron (through my obsessive researching and investigating my medical history, I realised I had untreated severe anaemia for the past decade), I think this won't apply to other people tho

\- A risky one to mention: reducing my time on here helped, and learning to 'ignore' symptoms. This was only possible once I had ruled out serious causes for peace of mind, because when I knew I didn't need to keep researching and could stop obsessively booking appointments and stop seeking a magical explanation, I stopped thinking as much about my symptoms, which admittedly did help A LITTLE... This is very tricky though as it contradicts my point above about loneliness and community, since Reddit did comfort me at times, but overall, I think I was focusing on how I physically felt *every minute of the day* which MIGHT have hindered recovery a little.  Ignoring my symptoms and pushing through made the loneliness 10x worse, because I wasn't allowing myself to even acknowledge it to *me*, let alone anyone else. But do think it was an important step in recovery!

TLDR: Have faith in your body to heal in time, give it what it needs to heal (max out on vitamins), be *gentle* and consistent, be around people who care, and - when you've ruled out scary causes - allow yourself to 'ignore' the dizziness, see what happens. Hopefully I'll make a 100% recovery post at some point!!",1,1747397287.0,cervical_vertigo,0,1.0,False

1knz3qq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knz3qq,[Brew] Metric Mechanical,"As promised more photos and full review of the Brew Metric Mechanical. Got the bracelet sized and wore it out this morning.

Obviously a cool look. I’m getting 1970’s vibes, TV dial type stuff. The dial is the star of the show. Lots of light play and reflective surfaces. Retains a lot of what made the Metric Auto cool, and dispenses with some elements that didn’t do much, like the concave rehaut. The flat minute track pops on this one. It also retains the mirror reflective margins. It doesn’t have a “circle in a square” problem I feel some of the other cushion case watches have. Sellita looks great through the exhibition caseback. The engraved plate looks great. It has a screw down crown, which is annoying on a hand wound because it has to disengage the clutch before screwing in, which feels dangerous. Probably better to leave a little slack in the mainspring. The size is good especially on the bracelet but smaller watches tend to roll on my wrist.

Bracelet is… ok. Nothing to write home about. Definitely the weak link here. As with all of these flat panel bracelets a la Group B, it pulls hairs a little bit. What this one does better than Group B is the clasp and the quick release. The clasp is milled and finished nicely, with the 3-d coffee bean. Lots of micro adjust options so leave the extra link in and dial it in on the clasp. The split pins are easier to use than PRX pins and collars, but possibly less secure. The CW bracelet is obviously the best, but I find it still pretty mediocre, especially if you are spending money on titanium models or one of the limited editions. 

At ~$900 it’s a couple hundred more than the PRX, roughly same price as Group B, and a couple hundred American dollars cheaper than a base The Twelve. I think that’s what it’s up against. It’s an upgrade from the Metric Auto with the Swiss movement, although the screw down crown is annoying. Overall, unless you want the Swiss movement, I think people might be happy enough with the Auto, although the manual wind dial really sings.

I work as FIFO(fly in fly out in the mining) where the company has to book and pay for tickets for me to get to work.. and I feel super bad for telling them off on the last minute, and the tickets are not cheap!

# “Roseanne, let's get a divorce!”



# Standing before Roseanne Sylvester was Brandon Graham, her husband of two years from a whirlwind marriage.



# He was clad in a sleek black trench coat, his handsome face void of any unnecessary expressions. His gaze toward her held a hint of apology. “I'm now with Yvonne.”



# Roseanne stood dumbfounded at the door, her large pajamas draped over her body, highlighting her slender figure. It took her a couple of seconds to comprehend his words. “She doesn't know you're married?”



# Two years ago, Egrea had experienced a sudden outbreak of a highly contagious disease, which had caused countless deaths and injuries.



# At that time, Brandon had just graduated from his postgraduate studies and joined a top-notch hospital in the country. Upon learning about the situation, he resolutely decided to go abroad as a volunteer to provide support.



# Back then, they had just gotten their marriage certificate.



# Two years had passed and the first thing he did upon returning to his homeland was, astonishingly, to propose a divorce. Even more shocking was that his affair was with the darling daughter of the Scott family.



# Brandon explained, “Our marriage registration was rushed. She was among the first volunteers, and she didn't know.”



# Sarcasm played at the corners of Roseanne's lips. “So, you concealed the fact that you were already married when you pursued her?”



# “I didn't,” Brandon hurriedly denied, a hint of regret flickering in his eyes. “The epidemic was fraught with danger. Yvonne repeatedly risked her life to save me. As we fought the disease together, time made our hearts grow fonder of each other. Roseanne, our marriage was rushed and there's no love between us. If it weren't for your father saving my grandfather, this union wouldn't have taken place. Yvie and I, on the other hand, share a deep understanding and mutual affection. Our love is genuine.”



# Roseanne scoffed. She could barely suppress the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “It was you who made the promise to me. Don't make it sound as if I forced you into getting married.”



# Having missed out on twenty years of familial affection, she felt like an outsider in the Sylvester family. Brandon's promise was like a warm embrace in the coldest winter, offering her a status that allowed her to remain.



# Driven by a sense of gratitude, when Graham Group was in a financial crisis, she stepped in to take charge. She invested in the business, taught herself business studies, economics, and management, and worked tirelessly day and night to help the company weather the storm.



# When Brandon's grandpa ,Kayden Graham, fell ill, she was constantly on the move, tirelessly seeking renowned doctors to treat him.



# Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law had a fondness for jewelry, handbags, and formal dresses. Whenever they expressed a desire for something, she would purchase it without hesitation.



# She was in charge of overseeing all the expenses for the Graham family, both for the business and the household.



# She had given so much, only to be told that there was no love between them.



# Brandon's face flushed red. “I'm sorry. Grandpa thinks highly of you, and I believed you would make an ideal wife. I followed his plans, made promises to you, and asked you to wait for me. If I hadn't met Yvonne, I would have been content to be a respectful and courteous husband to you.”



# The conversation had reached its conclusion, and there was no reason for Roseanne to remain. “Fine, I consent to the divorce.”



# While taken aback, Brandon also breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn't expected her to agree so readily.



# After some thought, he asked, “After the divorce, will you still stay with Graham Group?”



# “We'll be divorced then. Why should I stay?”



# “Yvie contributed significantly to the development of a provirus inhibitor. She's successfully joined Kiefyose Medical Research Institute. I'm still in my observation period, so I'll be returning to Egrea.”



# Roseanne was astonished. “A provirus inhibitor? Yvonne was involved in its development?”



# Why didn't that bunch of old folks tell me?



# When the topic of joining Kiefyose Medical Research Institute came up, pride filled Brandon's eyes. “Yvie is a genius in the medical field and can be considered an expert in drug research. The corporate world prioritizes self-interest, full of deception and internal strife. She's too innocent and not suited to join Graham Group. You, on the other hand, are perfectly suited for this line of work, thriving in the professional world like a fish in water. This is why Grandpa values you so much, and he might not agree to our divorce.”



# Brandon's words conveyed his deep dissatisfaction with the workplace culture.



# He reveled in the blissful life that wealth had afforded him, standing at the pinnacle of society. Yet, he looked down upon those who contributed to his family's fortune.



# A smirk of mockery crossed Roseanne's face.



# She couldn't believe she had actually once thought him to be dependable.



# Brandon didn't notice the change in Roseanne's expression as he continued, “As long as you stay with Graham Group, Grandpa won't make things difficult for us. If you choose to stay, I'll give you a one percent share, which would allow you to receive dividends of several million every month.”



# At this point, Roseanne couldn't help but laugh. “One percent? Do you think I care about that? You want me to divorce and make room for her, yet still expect me to clean up the mess in Graham Group and earn money for you. Where on earth would you find such a sweet deal?”



# Brandon thought his offered compensation was already generous. However, Roseanne's deliberate disparagement of his company felt to him like creating unnecessary turmoil.



# His face flushed with a hint of anger. “What do you mean by 'mess'? Graham Group can thrive just fine without you. Kiefyose Medical Research Institute is a world-renowned establishment. Yvie and I chose to contribute to our nation by working here. You're living a life of luxury. What more could you possibly be dissatisfied with?”

**Chapter 2 Sooner Rather Than Later**

Roseanne looked at him coldly. “I won't stay with Graham Group, nor do I want your shares. I own a four percent share in Graham Group, which is currently valued at about one point five billion. I'll only take what's rightfully mine.”  
  
Brandon was stunned. “Four percent? How did you manage to own so many shares in Graham Group?”  
  
“Two years ago, when Graham Group was facing a financial crisis, I invested five hundred million.”  
  
Brandon frowned, utterly unconvinced. “Five hundred million for a four percent share? Since when did the Graham Group shares become so cheap?”  
  
Brandon was aware of the crisis in Graham Group and her involvement in the company. However, nobody informed him about Roseanne's five-hundred-million investment.  
  
Acquiring four percent of shares for five hundred million was practically a giveaway.  
  
Thinking that she must have infiltrated the corporation and deliberately bought at a low price, he couldn't help but feel irritated.  
  
Roseanne found it ironic and didn't want to say anything more.  
  
Just as Brandon was about to speak again, she abruptly shut the door on him.  
  
His expression was terribly grim as he headed to Yvonne Scott's condominium overnight.  
  
Upon hearing Brandon's relay of Roseanne's words, Yvonne furrowed her brows. “Graham Group is enormous. A minor crisis two years ago wouldn't have shaken it to its core. The shares couldn't have possibly dropped that much. How could an investment of five hundred million secure her four percent of the shares? Most importantly, where did she get five hundred million from? I thought she was a woman of clear intentions, someone who dared to love and hate. Seems like I misjudged her. I didn't expect her to be so greedy.”  
  
Yvonne possessed a strikingly intense appearance, marked by deeply set features. Her cold, piercing eyes gave the impression that she had everything under control, as though nothing could evade her scrutiny.  
  
Brandon's eyes revealed his irritation. Two years ago, Roseanne had a gentle and dignified presence that seemed to complement him perfectly. However, in just two years, her luxurious lifestyle had altered her tastes. She even demanded an astounding sum of one point five billion.  
  
“Forget about one point five billion. She'll never even get five hundred million.” Yvonne cocked an eyebrow. “She was raised in the countryside and has lived a life of luxury for two years. It's normal for her to be a bit greedy. You two don't share any emotional bond, so if she agrees to divorce without making a fuss, I can give her ten million.”  
  
Brandon's heart softened. He pulled her into his embrace and said, “Yvie, you are truly kind-hearted. Meeting you has been my greatest fortune.”  
  
Yvonne let out a soft humph. “She lacks education and skills. As a fellow woman, I won't make things difficult for her.”  
  
Their eyes locked briefly before Yvonne looked away. Intrigued, Brandon scooped her up and headed toward the bed. “Yvie, it's been a while since we've been intimate.”  
  
Without any hesitation, Yvonne shed her clothes and offered a passionate kiss.  
  
Roseanne owned a house in the city. After deciding to divorce, she quickly packed her things and left.  
  
She took a bath and lay in bed. The thought of not having to wake up early for Graham Group the next morning brought her immense relief and comfort.  
  
She thought it wasn't so bad that the marriage ended.  
  
At that moment, a new message popped up. Roseanne tapped on it. It was a message from Arthur Xanthos.  
  
It read: *Roseanne, I've reviewed the proposal. It's quite impressive. I agree to collaborate with Graham Group.*  
  
Roseanne lightly tapped the screen, typing: *Old Mr. Xanthos, I'm leaving Graham Group. Please consider whether or not you wish to continue our collaboration. I can't guarantee the smooth progress of the project after my departure.*  
  
There were plenty of scoundrels in Graham Group, yet Kayden trusted them and wouldn't allow any action against them. All she could do was forcefully suppress their restless hearts.  
  
In her absence, those lying in wait would undoubtedly lose their patience.  
  
On the other end of the phone, an elderly man with snow-white hair rose from the couch. His once-cloudy eyes began to clear, and a smile slowly crept onto his lips.  
  
Seeing that, the butler rushed over in a state of panic. “Old Mr. Xanthos, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?”  
  
With a firm grip on the butler's hand and eyes gleaming, Arthur excitedly exclaimed, “Quick, find out if Roseanne is considering a divorce!”  
  
The fact that Brandon had returned to the country was not a secret. He had known about it not too long ago.  
  
Something major must have occurred for Roseanne to consider leaving Graham Group.  
  
“Old Mr. Xanthos, Brandon just returned to the country. It's unlikely he could have divorced Ms. Roseanne, right?”  
  
Arthur waved his hand dismissively. “What do you know? I've met that young man from the Graham family. He's a fool. Once Roseanne gets divorced, Calvin will have his chance. There's no time to waste. Go and find out more.”  
  
The next day, at the crack of dawn, Roseanne received a call from Kayden and drove to the Graham residence.  
  
She encountered Brandon and Yvonne at the main entrance.  
  
They walked hand in hand and looked just like a newlywed couple, deeply in love and inseparable.  
  
Their eyes met, and it was as if sparks were flashing in the air.  
  
With a beaming smile, Eileen Ziegler emerged, cheerfully taking Yvonne's hand into hers. She gently patted it and said affectionately, “Yvie, you're here. I've missed you dearly.”  
  
“Hello, Mrs. Graham.”  
  
Eileen praised Yvonne before turning her attention to Roseanne. “Rosie, you've made substantial money working for Graham Group these past two years. Think of it as compensation from us. It would be best for everyone if you got your divorce papers sooner rather than later.”  
  
Ever since Roseanne became part of the Graham family, Eileen had never made things difficult for her. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but rather, she didn't dare to.  
  
She had thought that the girl who grew up in the countryside would be gentle and obedient, easy to handle.  
  
Yet, as soon as Roseanne joined the family, she held the reins of power and even became the vice president of Graham Group. Eileen, despite her myriad thoughts and concerns, had to suppress them all and, ironically, ended up trying to please Roseanne instead.  
  
To say she wasn't frustrated would be a lie. Every day, she yearned to regain the authority she once had as a mother-in-law.  
  
Now that her son had returned to the country and was planning to divorce Roseanne, she was wholeheartedly in favor.  
  
Eileen lifted her chin as she commanded, “You won't need to buy the anti-aging cream for me anymore. Just give me their contact information.”  
  
A sarcastic smile curled at the corners of Roseanne's lips as she ignored Eileen. She strode through the door and headed straight for Kayden's study.  
  
Eileen's pride was wounded, and her expression darkened instantly. “Just as expected from a country girl. She lacks manners.”  
  
Soothingly, Yvonne said, “Mrs. Graham, don't stoop to her level. What's the brand of the anti-aging cream you mentioned? I can find it for you.”  
  
Eileen's expression softened at the mention of the anti-aging cream. “You're always so considerate. I'll send you the picture later.”  
  
Eileen came from a small family. Even after being married to the Graham family for over twenty years, she still couldn't fit in with the high-society ladies.  
  
Roseanne had somehow acquired a no-brand anti-aging cream with a distinct scent of herbs. At first, Eileen dismissed it. However, after developing a pimple one day, she decided to give it a try on a whim. To her surprise, the results were remarkably good.  
  
Eileen, always eager to build good relationships with everyone, regularly recommended the cream to the high-society ladies.  
  
Initially, the high-society ladies turned their noses up at anything without a brand name. But when they noticed Eileen's increasingly smooth and delicate skin, with her wrinkles diminishing over time, their curiosity got the best of them. They began to seek her out, eager to uncover her secret.  
  
This exclusive anti-aging cream was unavailable on the market, which helped Eileen build a solid reputation within her social circle. Each month, she requested about twenty boxes from Roseanne.  
  
Eileen feared that if Roseanne didn't disclose the source of the anti-aging cream, she would be reproached by the high-society ladies.  
  
With Yvonne's assurance, Eileen's spirits were lifted. Without further ado, she bid them farewell and headed off to join a gathering.  
  
Brandon took Yvonne's hand, leading her upstairs.  
  
Kayden was already in his twilight years, having spent most of his life navigating the business world. Despite his age, his prestige remained intact.  
  
Seeing them enter the study hand in hand, he couldn't contain his anger any longer. He grabbed a cup and hurled it with all his might.  
  
With a swift, deft motion, Brandon pulled Yvonne away just as the cup whizzed past their faces.  
  
The cup shattered with a loud crash, sending fragments flying everywhere and nearly injuring Yvonne's foot.  
  
Brandon's expression turned stern as he directed his anger toward Roseanne. “Roseanne, what did you tell Grandpa?”  
  
Roseanne's lips twitched, but before she could speak, Kayden slammed his hand down on the table in fury. “You good-for-nothing! Rosie waited for you for two years. How dare you bring back some random woman and even talk about divorce?”  
  
*Random woman?* Yvonne's brow furrowed, and a flicker of anger crossed her face.  
  
Brandon immediately retorted, “Grandpa! Yvie is the eldest daughter of the Scott family. She's always been a model for the women of Yolham. You used to adore her. How could you misunderstand her just based on Roseanne's one-sided story?”

**Chapter 3 Seize Her Shares**

Kayden trembled with rage as he leaned on his cane and stood up. “Really? You call being the other woman knowingly a misunderstanding?”  
  
Yvonne's face hardened. “Old Mr. Graham, I wasn't aware of your grandson's marriage at first. Had I known, I, a girl of good character, would have definitely stayed away from him.” She shot a fierce look at Brandon. “You told me there was no love between you and Roseanne, and that a divorce was inevitable. That's why I agreed to your advances. Now, I'm being labeled as the other woman and ridiculed. Handle your own family issues. We're done!”  
  
Just as Yvonne was about to leave, Brandon quickly grabbed her arm and whispered urgently, “Yvie, please don't go. My Grandpa is deceived by her, so he misunderstand you. If you leave me and Roseanne refuses to divorce, Graham Group will inevitably fall under her control, and my home will be destroyed.”  
  
His earnest plea caused Yvonne to stop in her tracks. She turned to him and demanded, “You must resolve this matter today.”  
  
“I will.” Brandon exhaled, then turned his gaze toward Kayden. “Grandpa, you didn't let me go abroad, so in my haste to get married, I misled you into thinking I liked Roseanne. It wasn't until I met Yvie that I understood what true love really is.”  
  
Kayden's face remained stern, while Roseanne watched the two perform with a sarcastic gaze.  
  
Brandon continued, “Yvie is currently the team leader at Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, and she has been invited to give lectures at several prestigious institutions. Her status is noble and she commands respect. Only someone like her is fitting to be the lady of the Graham family.”  
  
Kiefyose Medical Research Institute, a top-tier international research institute, had stringent and tricky assessments. Even professors in the medical field couldn't necessarily pass these tests.  
  
Surprisingly, Yvonne was the team leader.  
  
Kayden's tone softened slightly as he said, “Since this was a misunderstanding, I apologize, Ms. Scott. However, the only woman who can be my grandson's wife is Roseanne.”  
  
Brandon held Yvonne's hand tightly, his expression unwavering. “Grandpa, my mind is made up. If you try to stop us, Yvie and I will leave for Egrea, and we won't come back in this lifetime.”  
  
The more one tries to prevent it, the more likely it is to backfire. If Brandon really ran off to Egrea with Yvonne, their home would be utterly ruined.  
  
Kayden remained silent, his brows deeply furrowed.  
  
The Graham family had few members left, and he had tragically lost his only son.  
  
His grandson had no interest in business and was fully committed to studying medicine. His granddaughter was even worse—a total slacker. All play and no work.  
  
They had let him down, so he had no choice but to place his hopes on his granddaughter-in-law. However, he never expected that Brandon would cheat on her.  
  
He thought for a long time, guilt written all over his face. Turning to Roseanne, he sighed and said, “Rosie, the Graham family has wronged you. If you don't agree, I would rather die than let you two divorce.”  
  
Brandon nervously held Yvonne's hand, fearing that Roseanne might refuse to grant the divorce.  
  
Roseanne replied indifferently, “Since Brandon has someone he likes, there's no need for me to stay with the Graham family anymore.”  
  
Kayden looked sorrowful. “The Sylvester family already has a daughter, so your return would be redundant. It's better for you to stay with the Graham family. I don't have many days left. After I'm gone, Graham Group will be yours.”  
  
His grandson didn't want children, but there was still the option of in vitro fertilization. The child Roseanne would bear would still carry the Graham surname.  
  
Graham Group would remain within the family.  
  
Brandon's face was filled with displeasure. “Grandpa, how could Graham Group possibly be handed over to an outsider?”  
  
Roseanne glanced at him casually and replied, “Grandpa, I managed just fine without the Sylvester family until I turned twenty, and I'll continue to do so. As for this marriage, if Brandon won't file for divorce, I will. I am not so forgiving as to tolerate his infidelity and still stay to manage the household.”  
  
Kayden rubbed his temples, finally letting out a sigh. “You two leave. I need to have a chat with Rosie.”  
  
Brandon had more to say, but Yvonne pulled him away.  
  
Kayden gazed at Roseanne, his eyes filled with a mix of emotions. “Rosie, I can agree to your divorce.”  
  
Just as Roseanne breathed a sigh of relief, Kayden continued, “But you initially invested five hundred million, so you can only take back that amount. You can't take the shares. I'll have the finance department arrange for your dividends from the past two years to be given to you as well.”  
  
A touch of disbelief surfaced in Roseanne's eyes. “Why can I only take away five hundred million?”  
  
Kayden explained, “Since you're divorced, you're no longer a part of the Graham family. It's inappropriate for you to hold four percent of Graham Group's shares.”  
  
“Grandpa, I never intended to claim any part of the Graham family fortune; otherwise, I wouldn't have signed the prenuptial agreement. When Graham Group faced a financial crisis, with plummeting stock prices, I invested five hundred million and acquired four percent of the shares. I'm not just a part of your family. I'm also one of the shareholders of Graham Group.”  
  
Roseanne's eyes grew colder as she grasped his intention. “I've poured my heart and soul into Graham Group, and now the shares have significantly appreciated, consistently trending upward. My contribution has been immense. You don't have to give me the shares, but I want 1.5 billion based on the current market valuation!”  
  
Kayden's expression changed dramatically. He suppressed his shock and said, “That's simply out of the question. Including dividends and compensation, I'll offer you seven hundred million!”  
  
Roseanne let out a cold, bitter laugh, her trust in Kayden completely shattered. “I see it now. The kindness you've shown me these past few years was only because I was useful, and I could bring benefits to Graham Group. I guess I misjudged you. You made me sign a prenuptial agreement. You're no better.”  
  
Brandon was unaware of her sacrifices, and she could accept that.  
  
But Kayden had seen everything she had done for the family. Now, he was treating her like an enemy, even trying to seize her shares.  
  
With a steady gaze, Roseanne added, “Brandon cheated, and I can leave with nothing. I don't care about the Graham family's wealth, but what's mine is mine, and no one can take it away.”  
  
Her mood shifted rapidly. Kayden coughed a few times, took a sip of coffee, and said in a resonant voice, “Rosie, I'm really grateful for your initial investment of five hundred million, which helped Graham Group. But I know your parents only gave you fifty million as a dowry.”  
  
His words were diplomatic, yet Roseanne discerned their true meaning. She laughed mockingly. “It doesn't matter where the money came from; the fact is, I invested it.”  
  
“You became a shareholder in Graham Group only after the marriage. Even before that, you signed a prenuptial agreement stating that you wouldn't take anything from the corporation. Seven hundred million is already a generous offer. I haven't even signed the share transfer document yet.”  
  
A frosty glint appeared in Roseanne's eyes. “So, you had it all planned from the very start.”  
  
Signing a prenuptial agreement was exactly what she wanted. After all, her assets were all over the place, and if she were to split them with Brandon, she would surely be at a loss.  
  
She didn't care about this small share, but giving it to the Graham family for free was out of the question.  
  
It was a bit of a hassle, but if she handed it over to the lawyer, she wouldn't have to spend much time on it.  
  
Kayden stroked his beard, his deep-set eyes gleaming with wisdom. “One must know their place in life. Stirring up a big fuss won't do you any good. The Sylvester family won't help you, and opposing the Graham family is like throwing straws against the wind.”  
  
When gentleness didn't work, he resorted to a more forceful approach.  
  
A smirk played on Roseanne's lips. “If you're so eager to take my money, I'll just file a lawsuit.”  
  
Continuing this conversation wouldn't lead to any resolution, and staying here was merely a waste of time.  
  
Kayden scoffed. “I'd like to see which lawyer would dare to represent you and go against the Graham family.”  
  
“Old Mr. Graham, you won't be around for much longer, so there's no need for you to worry.”  
  
With that, Roseanne turned and walked away.  
  
Kayden's face turned pale. Suddenly struggling to breathe, he shattered the cup in his hand.  
  
Upon hearing the commotion, the butler hastily pushed open the door, only to be met with Roseanne's cold visage. Instinctively, he greeted her, “Mrs. Graham.”  
  
“The Graham family is ruthless and greedy. I'm afraid I can't bear that title.”  
  
Her tone was light and airy, carrying a hint of mockery.  
  
The butler paused for a moment. After Roseanne left, he hastily rushed into the study.  
  
Inside the car, Brandon furrowed his brows. “I really can't understand why Grandpa places such high importance on Roseanne, even considering giving her Graham Group.”  
  
Yvonne had already done her on Roseanne. She said softly, “From what I know, Roseanne didn't make it to university. She barely scraped through middle school, skipping classes and getting into fights, bullying her peers. She simply doesn't have the capability to be a vice president.”  
  
Brandon was taken aback. It was his first time hearing about Roseanne's affairs in the countryside, and he never imagined her to be a troublemaker.  
  
Yvonne continued, “I knew about the crisis at Graham Group two years ago. When your grandfather fell ill, three directors took advantage of the situation, embezzled company funds, and fled abroad. Eventually, the police brought them back, and the credit should go to them. Somehow, rumors started circulating that Roseanne deserved the praise. People also said she secured several collaborations, stabilizing Graham Group. As for the five hundred million... The Sylvester family clearly doesn't care about Roseanne. Otherwise, they wouldn't have married her off as soon as they found her. There's no way they would have given a dowry of five hundred million; at most, a few tens of million. I suspect she's done something illegal. If it ever comes to light, it could potentially implicate Graham Group.

**Chapter 16: The Spirit Jacqueline Hernandez And The Pet**

She looked at the wall while one of the trainees had his palm pointed towards it.

""Ugh, Come on, Bertil! Squeeze in your asscheeks, and fire."" She told him in an annoying teenage voice.

""I am trying, Jacqueline. Why are you so demanding? Your organization contacted me and explained that I had powers. It is not my fault I can not get anything out of me."" Bertil tried explaining.

""Ugh! Why am I stuck with new Trainees as punishment? It is unfair that Greta was re-assigned after the last failed assignment."" Jacqueline uttered to herself.

Bertil kept making weird movements like he was trying to shoot toward the wall, and for a moment, a little bit of ash in a light blue colour came out from his palm, which was the size of a drop of water. Jacqueline followed it as it slowly swayed to the ground and disappeared in smoke. She looked at Bertil, surprised he couldn't get any energy on his first day. Weirdly, he was sweating a lot and must have used up a lot of energy to make that puny shot. A little bit worried about his intense sweating and shaky moves he was doing she needed to check if everything was alright with him.

""Uh, you are sweating a lot, Bertil. Are you alright?"" She asked.

He turned his head to the left towards her with a distraught look and responded:

""I think I popped in my pants; something big is covering my cheeks.""

She bent to the right to check behind him and noticed his cheeks were not balanced. Luckily, she couldn't feel the smell at all.

When she quickly glared to the right, she saw her pet behind a container, gesturing with both claws in the air, signalling her to come to it.

""Maybe you should rest today, go home, and fix your…problem in your pants, Bertil!"" She tried explaining that the training was over.

He walked away from the road, looking down at the ground, a little bit depressed about pooping his pants.

When the coast was clear, her pet came running to her and jumped up in her arms, looking satisfied to be reunited with her again. Both were smiling like they had been away from each other for a long time, but in reality, it had only been a couple of hours.

“Sjev Sjev!, Se, Sjev Sjeeeeev sjev!” It uttered Jacqueline, who was surprised.

""Are you sure, Kutt?""

""Sjev,"" Kutt answered in a nodding matter.

""So, if we try to get on the mission, we can maybe find the Hunting Spear Of Destruction. Are you sure the spear is in Hell?"" She asked.

Kutt nodded, smiling with her sharp teeth.

“Sjev sjev sjev?” Kutt Asked.

""We must try to sneak in on the assignment and go there with the investigator. He is a human, so he is weak. We are strong enough to protect humans and then try to find the spears. It can not be that hard, right Kutt?""

""Sjuuuuuuv!"" Kutt roared out in the air in happiness.

 

""We are here now, Mr Zark!"" The woman in the front seat said, noticing that Zark had fallen asleep during the one-hour drive back to the office.

He scratched his head and, yawning, gave the Witch a cold look before opening the door and stepping out. He noticed several Witches lined up in one line opposite each other, their heads bowing down to the ground. He opened the door and saw an older lady passing by him in a hurry. Zark slowly went in and noticed the Witches still having their heads bowed to the floor without any sound. When the door behind him closed, a wind blew through him from behind, and he quickly turned around, wondering how the closing of the door could cause that kind of wind when it was good weather outside. He walked between the lines of the still, quiet Witches, and one green-haired one was crying. He scratched his head as he slowly moved toward the elevator, and the Witches started commenting.

""Good luck, Mr. Zark! Please save the organization!"" A black-haired Witched commented.

""So many Witches have died for the cause. Please be careful!"" Another one with blue hair commented.

""Please save the baby, Mr Zark!"" A yellow-haired one commented.

Zark thought the whole situation was weird because it is usually just a Hi or Hello when coming to the office.

When the doors to the elevator opened up, the green-haired one yelled out:

""YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE!""

He stared at them with a surprised look when the strong wind he had felt earlier swooshed right through him. He pressed the button that said ten, and exactly when the door shut, he quickly turned around and hit with a right hook behind him. As he hit the mirror, he noticed a head temporarily showing itself before disappearing, and in the tight space, he tried to do a high kick with his left leg when a yellow light stopped the kick midair, and the invincible figure screamed out in the air:

""JACQ…YUK…IT!""

He noticed another yellow light coming towards him from beneath, and he tried to bend his head backwards quickly, but he had no chance with the lightning speed. It hit the jaw as he flew up with full force on the ceiling and fell on the figure as it showed itself looking like a teenage girl. He quickly tried elbowing her head with several blows as she protected herself with her hands, and he managed to get one clean hit on her right cheek when she made a mistake and turned her head a little bit. A light shone behind him as she taped both her feet together, and both of them flew up into the ceiling, with Zark taking the hit while his body protected her, and both fell on the ground. She quickly got up and circled him to keep her distance as he slowly got up near the door with blood-soaked hair. He spit blood on the floor and tried catching his breath as he asked her:

""Who are you?""

The elevator sounded as the doors slowly opened, and the girl's right leg switched to a darker yellow light. He tried attacking her but to no avail. As time and space had stopped for Zark, he saw her jump in the air and tried to follow the movement, but he was going in slow-motion as she kicked him right on the chest as he flew out from the elevator and slid onto the floor with Veronica and Abella in chock on what was going on.

""My name is Jacqueline Hernandez!"" She answered Zark's question earlier as he was not moving on the ground.

Suddenly, a long red whip got pushed out from Zark's right hand, which was long and burning in red fire.

""GET DOWN!"" Veronica yelled out in the air as a red aura gushed from Zarks body. He slowly got up from the ground when Jacqueline entered the hallway.

""Have you not had enough old man?"" She told him.

Zark swung his right arm backwards as the whip burned through the wall, crashing the outer windows and going through Victoria's office with the blue shield deactivating as the whip, after 180 degrees, hit the ceiling, making a deep line and going through the Window. Zark then pushed his arm with a quick move forward, with Abella quickly kicking her assistant toward Victoria so they hit the coffee table. She quickly rolled to the right as the whip burned through the floor before it went up when Abella chanted quickly:

""Sa na fa pru tan"" hit her palm with full force on the floor, and everyone froze.

Abella got up from the ground, as did Victoria, but the assistant froze as she was too weak to handle the immense power of the spell. Jacqueline was in midair with a dropkick coming towards Zarks head as she had grabbed the whip midair, which surprised Abella. Victoria moved closer to Jacqueline as she noticed she was still moving slowly on the frozen spell, which would typically not be possible. She saw something grey sticking out, and she quickly yelled to Abella:

""IT'S A SPENX DRAGON! TAKE COVER!"" Victoria yelled to Abella, who tried distancing herself.

An enormous explosion was heard from the 10^(Th) floor as smoke covered the air, and the Witches down on the ground outside of the building stared up at the building in shock.

Several Witches moved quickly up to the 10^(Th) floor as the smoke covered the whole floor.

""Look for survivors."" The Pink-haired Witch ordered the others, who were driving Zark, to the office.

They scattered into the smoke as one of them returned quickly, with Victoria supporting herself on her shoulders. Abella came right after as the smoke started to clear the area because of the broken Windows.

""I FOUND ZARK! HE STILL HAS A PULSE BUT IS UNCONSCIOUS."" Someone yelled out.

Veronica chose to stay to see if Jacqueline appeared when the smoke slowly vanished in the area, but she was gone. Besides Zark, the Spenx was in a foster position and was not moving. A Witch quickly hurried, picked it up, and ran towards the nursery in the building.

""GIVE IT A BREATHING TUBE AND PUT SOME LETTUCE BESIDE IT. UPDATE ME EVERY FIVE MINUTES OF THE STATUS!"" Veronica screamed to the Witch in the corridor, who had Kutt in her arms.

""Where is the girl?"" Abella asked out in the air, shocked by everything that had happened.

""This was the first time I had seen a Spenx. I had only read about them because there was little information about them in Valiant. A scarce breed, the explosion that happened was not the girl. It was the dragon who did the explosion in self-defence. The reason why Jacqueline is gone, from what I found, is that the girl is the shell only. The Spenx holds a part of the girl's soul in protection. There is no information about these creatures because they often walk around invisible to everyone. They walk by the side of their host. The books say that if the Spenx dies, the soul it carries gets destroyed, even if it only holds a part of it. That is why there is barely much information about it. If a Spenx would sacrifice itself with a soul inside it and would do an explosion to die, it would have killed all of us in the one-kilometre distance, turning everyone to ash. A Spenx is the weakest dragon ever, but it can walk in dark areas, only areas Death itself walks."" Veronica said as everyone went quiet.

Abella and Veronica looked at each other, knowing they were in a complicated situation.

1knywi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1knywi7/rf_three_problems_one_solution/,"[RF] ""Three Problems, One Solution""","One day, Tom, Alex, and Joseph—three close friends—gathered at a small café to spend some time sipping tea and smoking cigarettes when a heated discussion erupted among them.

Alex: ""Come on, Tom, it’s not the end of the world. It didn’t happen this time, so what? You can try again next year. And if not then, the year after. That’s no reason to be this gloomy. The look on your face is dragging us down too. In my opinion, you've already done a fantastic job. Now's the time to give yourself a break and enjoy the things you've achieved.""

(Tom took a deep breath...)

Joseph: ""Don’t be so hard on him. Give him some time—his frown will lift. I’m sure he didn’t mean to bring down the vibe. The poor guy’s been working hard lately, preparing for that exam. It’ll take some time for the fatigue to fade. Tom, how about I order you one of those strong doubles to get your blood pumping?""

(Alex’s eyes sparkled and Tom smiled…)

Tom: ""Joseph, it’s true I spent a lot of energy, but you know me well—I’m not the kind of guy to fall apart that easily. Alex is right too; there’s no way I’ll miss that opportunity next year. In fact, I was thinking about finishing a few other projects. Now that I have some free time, I can make the most of it and complete them. And now that you mentioned it, I wouldn’t mind a coffee. Go ahead and order one.""

Joseph: ""You got it! And Alex, didn’t you say you don’t like coffee?""

(Joseph winked at Tom)

Alex: ""Me? No way, man—I chew coffee beans even in my downtime. Get a double for me too, quick. Tom’s words have fired me up. Dude, relax a bit. I brought up next year just so you’d unwind and maybe join me in some fun plans—not to have you pull out a stack of unfinished projects from your pocket. Now that we’re on this topic, I’ve got a serious question for you, and you need to answer it. Don’t you ever get tired of burdening yourself with all this planning and piling on the work? Life is short. If you keep pushing yourself like this all the time, you’ll miss the whole point of living. Life is these joyful moments we’re sharing. It’s about enjoying and letting time slip by unnoticed. If we’re always working, we’ll miss our fair share of happiness. Don’t you see? Even scientists say our health depends on being happy and carefree.""

Tom: ""Honestly, yeah. But those kinds of things are easy for you to say, since you're not worried about the future. You know your dad’s work and wealth will be more than enough for you.""

(Alex gave a short smirk.)

Joseph: ""If you ask me, I think what Tom’s doing is admirable. Someday he’ll get married, have kids, and the more he earns, the better he can make life for those around him.""

(Tom furrowed his brows...)

Tom: ""Can you stop, Joseph? I’ve told you this before—especially you—I’m not doing all this just to make a little more money or to improve someone else's situation. I want to reach a position in this world that’s truly worthy of me. Everyone should know how much potential I have. I want a name that rings familiar in people’s ears all over the world. I want my legacy to be my memory, still alive in people’s minds even years after my death. So please, next time you speak about my motivations, be careful.""

(Joseph was a bit taken aback by his words.)

Tom: ""Why do both of you keep trying to change my outlook? It’s not like I’m interfering in your lives. I don’t need your advice—I know exactly what I’m doing. And as for you, Alex, let me just say your words are childish. These entertainments and pleasures you talk about—everyone these days knows they’re pointless. They lead nowhere. They’re just a waste of time. When your dying moment comes, will you really be okay with asking yourself, ‘What did I even accomplish?’""

(Alex laughed…)

Alex: ""Oh man, you’re not even hearing me. No problem. Let each of us build the life we envision: I’ll take every moment and you can have that one glorious final second you’re chasing.""

(A silence settled in, and each began sipping their drinks.)

Joseph: ""Guys, seriously now, this whole debate’s been on my mind. Let’s try to continue without clashing like fighting cocks. I truly believe both of you are kind people. When I listen to what you say, and realize your motives are selfish at all, I wonder how you manage to be so selfless without any inner pressure. Like, remember those days we’d go to the game net café? Only two people could play at a time, and even though I’d try to step back so you guys could play longer, we all know I’d turn into a spoiled kid and even force my way in when it wasn’t my turn. But it’s not just that—I’ve often seen you two forgive others easily. Back then, I thought maybe you just had better discipline over the same values I held. But now I wonder—did I forget something fundamental? Please, let’s drop the bitterness and reflect a bit on this and on what each of us carries inside.""

(Tom placed his hand on Joseph’s shoulder…)

Tom: ""Look who’s become our philosopher! Sure, man—of course. You know I love you. When you ask this nicely, how could I possibly refuse? I’ve got some thoughts, but let’s see what our handsome Alex has to say first.""

(Alex’s grin widened a little…)

Alex: ""Well, in those few seconds just now, I was thinking. What I see in all three of us is some kind of emptiness or void we’re all trying to escape from—each in our own way. I chase pleasure, Tom seeks triumph, and Joseph seems to believe he must be a virtuous man. I don’t know—it just suddenly struck me. Honestly, I can’t help much more with the big picture—my brain’s already steaming. Take it if it’s useful. But about myself, I can say no one ever told me as a kid that I had to ‘be someone’ or that I was meant to be a famous name. My parents never made me act a certain way to show love or earn praise. Honestly, it was just the usual stuff…""

(Joseph cut Alex off…)

Joseph: ""The start of your speech made a lot of sense to me—yeah, it really clicked. Bravo. But I’m sure even you didn’t realize what you just blurted out.""

(The two of them looked at Alex, and all three burst into laughter.)

Joseph: ""Tom, if you’re not going to comment on this and finish Alex’s thoughts, then I’ll take over.""

(Tom raised his palm…)

Tom: ""Hold on, let me speak so you’ll see I’m about to say exactly what’s in your mind—maybe even better. Despite all his madness, Alex unwittingly said what needed to be said. I saw, right in the middle of all this, a clear process of hollowing out of values. When we were kids and were taught to become something in the future to be valuable, our minds logically concluded: ‘If I can gain value in the future, that means I lack value in the present.’ And so, we started to feel an emptiness within ourselves.""

(A gentle, lasting smile spread across their faces…)

Joseph: ""Bravo, Tom—that couldn’t have been said better. Now that Alex planted the seed, and you brought forth the grapes, let me finish the job and make the wine. First, what Alex’s story shows is that in the absence of external value imposition, the joyful childhood games eventually evolved into adult pleasures that he now imposes on himself as if they were values. And now I see how these values work. I’d even call them ‘valueless values’—because that’s what they deserve to be called. Even if we reach them, they multiply in new forms: ‘better’ if they’re goals, or ‘more’ if they’re experiences. So not only do they fail to heal the wound, they keep it fresh. That’s why I found it hard to uphold my values—I felt a lack within. But you didn’t feel that lack, because your worth wasn’t projected into some future state. You could be selfless more easily.""

""There’s only one true remedy. My teacher used to say: Man, forged of gold, deludes himself that the touch of copper might raise his value.""

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Also, there's a photo on my profile, would be great to see yours too",1,1747396154.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Alan waited until 3:17 a.m. to call her.

It wasn’t out of caution—it was because the console told him to.

Or rather, because he’d noticed a subtle pattern in the output logs. A sequence of numerical identifiers—timestamps, maybe—spelled out in base-37, pointing to that exact moment, as the optimal intersection of timelines for the least reality drift.

He didn’t trust it.

He called anyway.

The phone rang once.

Then twice.

Then—

“Alan?” Yusra’s voice was hoarse, groggy. “Is something wrong?”

“I need to show you something.”



They met in his lab an hour later, her coat still damp from the rain.

Alan hadn’t turned on the overhead lights. The glow from the monitors was enough. It cast the room in shifting cold hues, like moonlight filtered through data.

“I swear to you, I haven’t slept in 36 hours, and I don’t think I’m tired,” he said by way of greeting.

Yusra gave him a look she used to reserve for students talking about the Mandela Effect like it proved anything. “Alan. What’s this about?”

Instead of answering, he turned the monitor toward her.

QUERY?

Then, slowly, methodically, he walked her through everything.

The anomaly in the code.
The recursive structure.
The strange, non-existent creation timestamp.
The messages.
The console.
The edit.

He showed her the voicemail from his mother.

Showed her the hospital records that had rewritten themselves. The fact that two timelines now occupied the same memory space inside his head.

He even typed in a demonstration:

EDIT EVENT: CUP OF COFFEE ON DESK — COLOR: RED

And right before her eyes, the chipped white mug beside the terminal blinked, once, like a frame skip in a low-res video.

Then it was red.

Ceramic. Warm. Steaming.

Yusra didn’t speak for a full minute.

Then: “No. No, Alan. That’s not—this isn’t—”

“It is.”

Her knees buckled slightly and she sat, hard, in the chair across from him.

“You’re saying this thing isn’t just simulating reality,” she said, voice thin. “It’s… it’s the root layer.”

Alan nodded. “It’s the command line interface for existence itself. Reality is mutable, stored. A construct of readable, writable states. I’ve seen the futures—some undefined, some already trailing behind me like shadows.”

Yusra turned away from the screen.

“And you’ve used it?”

He hesitated. “Yes.”

“You edited time.”

“I edited a moment. A death. I brought her back.”

“And you still exist in the same continuity?”

“I remember both. As if my consciousness got grandfathered in.”

She leaned back, eyes unfocused. “That… that breaks everything. Causality. Thermodynamics. The arrow of time. It doesn’t make sense. If this is true, Alan—”

She looked at him now, fully. “If this is true, then we’re not discovering the structure of the universe. We’re interfacing with something that wrote it.”

Alan whispered, “The code didn’t just emerge from the void. It is the void’s response to being perceived.”

She blinked. “What?”

He leaned forward, like a man confessing to a fire.

“The console told me… the system was built through emergent feedback between probability space and self-awareness. The code didn’t simulate physics. It encoded the conditions for physics to exist.”

Her hands trembled now. “That’s… That’s creation.”

“No. Worse.”

“Worse?”

“It means there was no creation. No intelligent design. No divine spark. Just a loop. Observation gave rise to data. Data became structure. Structure formed a system. The system made beings. The beings observed. And looped it all back.”

Yusra said nothing. Her eyes were glassy.

Then softly: “We are echoes in an echo.”

He nodded.

She wiped a tear she hadn’t realized was falling. “If this is true, Alan… it means we can rewrite everything. War. Disease. Extinction.”

“I know.”

“But… how do you know it’s safe?”

Alan looked at the monitor.

At the blinking cursor.

Then at her.

“I don’t.”



Then Yusra did something strange.

She stood, walked to the terminal, and typed a single word into the query prompt:

WHY?

There was a long pause.

Then:

TO SEE IF YOU WOULD.

But sitting there, I felt this unexpected wave of peace wash over me. I realized that I don't have to chase big moments to find happiness or rest.

# Chapter 1

Rachel

I’m running from my ex-husband. Yes, he's my ex-husband but he still finds ways to get to me. I’m done with the physical and emotional abuse.

I lost a baby because of his abuse, which was the final straw, I don't even know if I could have children anymore. I didn't wait for a test in the hospital. I just wanted to get out, out of the hospital and out of the marriage. Just out.

I filed for divorce a week after the miscarriage and to my surprise, he didn't contest the divorce. I didn't think about that too much. I was just happy to get away from him after the divorce and from the fact that he didn't stop harassing me. I had to swallow my pride and ask for help. I never told my family what happened in my marriage. I didn't even tell them about the miscarriage. They always warned me about him, but I never listened.

My brother was the only one who didn’t say I told you so. He helped me get a plan together and get away. He contacted a friend who stayed in New York City and asked him if I could stay with them till I was on my feet. He bought me a one-way ticket to New York City. Luckily my passport and visa were still valid for another few years. My brother and I decided that the further I could go, the better it would be. If I stayed in South Africa, he could always get to me. Moving to a new continent would make it a bit more difficult.

So here I am on my way to New York. I sold all my “I’m sorry” jewellery from him and that gave me a good sum of money to survive a few months if I didn’t get a job. He spoiled getting jewellery as a gift for me, it will always leave a sour taste in my mouth. Just another thing he took away from me.

I’m on the plane en route to New York via Dubai when suddenly I’m startled by the sound of the air hostess.

“Miss are you okay”

“Yes thank you, why do you ask?

“You are crying, miss”

When I touched my face I felt the wetness on my skin. I’m not sure why I was crying, was it because I’m on my way to freedom, or was it because I’m leaving everything and everyone I know behind?

“I’m really okay thank you for asking,” I told her

""Can I bring you anything miss?""

I decided a glass of wine would help me through this flight. ""A glass of wine please,"" I asked her.

She immediately brought me a glass of wine and some pretzels. ""Thank you"" I smiled at her ""My pleasure.""

I sat back and enjoyed my wine and pretzels afterwards I put my head down and I was fast asleep.

I slept most of the flight. I don't know if it was the wine because I was emotionally drained and physically tired or just a combination of everything.

When we landed I felt a bit better, a bit stiff from the long flight but better. I had a new perspective, new dreams for my life and a determination that I would make this work and I would get a job. “That’s it Rachel be positive you will make it and you can do this and if you struggle remember these words fake it till you make it,"" I told myself over and over. 'Fake it till you make it.' Mind over matter.

Massimo

My name is Massimo Marchetti, I'm the son of Salvadore and Rossa Marchetti, who are legal restaurant owners. I emphasise the legal because,

my work on the other hand is not as legal. I have a criminal empire, and my main goal is to be the head of all the Mafia families in New York City. My father was never in the Mafia or worked for the mafia but that was always what I wanted to be, a Mafia boss, my father never understood where this came from for me but it's just who I was. With all the money and power I have in New York City I would say it's only a matter of time, I've worked hard to get where I am. And I will be the head of the Mafia family. My best friend Damon is head of the organized crime gangs in New York City. How can we be friends, when we do the same thing, you will ask. Damon and I have a good understanding we don't step on each other's toes we help each other. He wants me to be head of the Mafia family for his own reasons.

In my private life the bit I have, I'm dominant and I practice BDSM it's difficult to get women that are in the lifestyle and not just pretend, to get their hands on your money, Or tell people you assaulted them. It's a very difficult situation. There is a club I go to when I want to play, but I just don't go there often. There is just not enough time in my days.

When it comes to love, I'm not so sure love is in my cards, and love at first sight is not something I believe in. Women are just a distraction and get in the way of business. I sound cynical but that is what I think. If I ever ""fall"" for someone that person would have to be some kind of amazing. Women always say if a man comes riding up on a white horse he will be for them. Maybe if a woman comes riding up a white horse to me I might think about it. I'll think hard about it.

I have my men that work for me so there are always people around me I'm never alone. I never feel the need to go and look for women or other friends. I'm content.

I got off the plane at JFK and took a deep breath. Is this what freedom smells like? I really hope so.

First I had to get rid of some of the clothes I was wearing. It was winter in Cape Town so I wore a winter short dress, jacket, leggings and long boots, at least I had sandals in my carry-on, how I remembered to pack sandals in my carry-on I would not know, I'm just glad I did. Imagine walking around, in this heat with winter clothes. No, thank you. I went to the ladies' bathroom, got rid of my winter clothes and put my sandals on, the dress was still a bit heavy but at least I felt cooler. That felt so much better when I left the lady's bathroom. New York is hot, I'm definitely not used to this heat.

I went to baggage claim and got all my bags. I was feeling very excited about this new chapter in my life.

First things first get an Uber and go to my brother's friend’s. I got inside an Uber and gave the Uber driver the address of Herman, my brother's friend. He stays on the Lower East Side. I've never met my brother's friend but he sounded very nice when my brother spoke of him, and it's very nice of him to let me stay with them.

As the Uber driver pulled from the parking area I was so overwhelmed by everything I saw, it was so big, busy, and beautiful. I pressed my face against the window and looked at all the buildings and cars going past us and all I could hear in my head was the song of Alicia Keys, Empire State of Mind, the words.

“Baby I’m from New York

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

There’s nothin’ you can’t do

Now you’re in New York

These streets will make you feel brand-new

Lights will inspire you

Let's hear it for New York

New York, New York""

Those words kept on playing in my head over and over, when we reached the building I saw another yellow cab and was very disappointed in not taking one of them at the airport, where even in New York if you didn't ride in one of the yellow cabs? I made a mental note to use one of them soon. We reached Grand Street, on the Lower East Side where Herman's apartment where. The apartment building looked like a brownstone apartment building. It looked like New York or should I say what you see in the movies.

I got out of the Uber, got my luggage, thanked the driver, and found the apartment.

A well build guy with brown hair and brown eyes opened the door, he was an attractive guy. Is everyone in New York attractive? I thought to myself.

“Hello Rachel I’m Herman come in please”

“Hi Herman Thank you”

“Can I help you with your bags?”

“Thank you Herman I’ll appreciate it”

Herman took my bags to my room ""You are just in here Rachel, I'll leave you to unpack so long, I'll be in the lounge"" Herman told me and left me to unpack. It was a small room but it was good enough for now. When I was done I went to the lounge to find Herman.

“There you are,” he said as I walked into the lounge

“How was your flight?”

“Long but I’m here now and can’t wait to start over”

""Come have a seat and we can talk. Can I offer you wine?""

""Yes please""

""Red or white?""

""you choose I said"" I went to take a seat on an L-shaped brown couch next to the window and got comfortable.

“What’s your plans?”

“well first things first, I want to look for a job, I know I have an admin background but I’ll do anything until I get settled and be able to look for something in admin.”

“My girlfriend saw an advert for a barista at a coffee shop on the Upper East Side if you are interested.

It can keep you busy while you're looking for something else”

“That sounds great, then I can look for an apartment so long with the savings I have”

“No rush Rachel, really no rush, I told your brother you can stay here as long as you need.""

“Thank you Herman but it’s fine it will be good for me to be on my own and start living again and be independent.""

“As you wish, I’ll give you the address of the coffee shop then you can go and see them tomorrow”

“Thank you, Herman”

We sat and talked about what he does for a living where his girlfriend Sally works and how he knows my brother.

We drank a whole bottle of wine while we were chatting away. Two hours went by without us noticing. When I checked my watch I told Herman I was going to have a shower and get into bed, the jetlag was getting to me and I wanted to be at the coffee shop early the next morning.

“No problem Rachel if it’s possible can we have dinner tomorrow night? Then you can meet Sally as well and we can talk about everything”

“I'll make sure I’m here tomorrow evening, Thank you, Heman, Have a good night""

""Good night Rachel""

I went to my room and got my toiletries. Then I went for a much-needed shower. The flight took 36 hours with all the connection flights and I felt sticky and dirty from the flight. I got in the shower and washed away all the dirt and while I washed my hair, I thought about my ex-husband and how I'm actually washing him and the pass away. I'm in a new Country, New City, and far away from him. I'm going to make this work. I'll go into that coffee shop tomorrow with more confidence than I feel and get the job, that will be a beginning a good beginning. When I got in bed I felt lighter and ready for tomorrow.",1,1747395587.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1**

After seven years of being Dante’s Luna, we finally had our first child.

When I brought him the prenatal report, beaming with joy, he frowned and asked me: “Whose child is this?”

I was stunned. “It’s yours.”

“We’ve been married for seven years and never had a child. I go on business trip for two months, and suddenly you’re expecting a child? Do you think I am a fool?”

His words chilled me to the core.

The child was already two months old, so the timing should make sense to him.

Off to the side, his mother Aveline sneered coldly. “No wonder why you’re always out late at night. So that’s where you’ve been—seeing another man.”

The truth was, I had been working overtime most nights. Their accusations pushed me to tears.

In the end, I told him, “If you don’t believe me, then let’s go to the pack doctor and do a paternity test.”

To my surprise, Dante agreed without hesitation.

I was deeply disappointed. The moment we finished the test that day, I packed up and went back to my parents’ old pack.

The results would take three days. Dante and I agreed to meet at the pack doctor’s office when they were ready.

If the child turned out to be his, he would give me a public apology.

If not, he’d sever our mate bond, and I’d leave with nothing. No money, no title.

During those three days, Dante didn’t contact me even once.

Furious and shattered, I told my mom that once we got the results, I’d terminate the pregnancy, reject him, serve the mate bond, and leave him for good.

My mom tried to calm me down. She told me to give him another chance.

“Dante loves you like his life. You’ve been together so long, but couldn’t get a kid, and he never complained about it. Now you’re suddenly carrying a child—it’s normal for him to be suspicious.”

“Just wait. When the results come out, he’s going to hit himself for ever doubting you.”

She wasn’t wrong. Dante did have a temper, but he truly loved me.

So I decided to listen to her and give him another chance.

But on the day we were supposed to meet, I overslept.

Just as I was about to head out, the doorbell rang.

I opened the door and saw Dante standing there.

I thought he had come to pick me up after realizing his mistake.

“Dante, you saw the results, right? I never—”

Before I could finish, he hit me in the face.

He hit me so hard that the blow made my vision go black. Blood filled my mouth, and a ringing buzzed in my ears.

I looked up at him, disbelief written all over my face.

“Dante, are you out of your mind?!”

—Smack.

Another slap.

I stumbled back a few steps and fell to the floor, hitting the table behind me.

With a clatter, everything on the table scattered to the ground.

The noise brought my mom rushing out from the bedroom. She screamed and hurried to help me up.

“Dante, how dare you hit her?!”

“She deserves it.” Dante’s eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed a tissue box from the coffee table and hurled it at me. “Renna, you cheated on me. I’m going to beat you to death, you filthy woman.”

I grabbed my mom and ducked out of the way just as the tissue box flew past us.

What was he saying?

Did that mean the results said the child wasn’t his?

I cried out, “I’ve never been with anyone else. There must be a mistake!”

“Mistake?” Dante growled through gritted teeth as he pulled out his phone and threw it at me. “The evidence is clear. There’s no mistake.”



**Chapter 2**

I picked up Dante’s phone and looked at the screen.

It showed a chat between him and Alpha Xander’s Luna, Sienna.

Xander was Dante’s friend and the Alpha of the neighboring pack.

I’d met Sienna a few times at the Alpha Ball, so we could be considered acquaintances.

In the messages, Sienna told Dante that I was having an affair with Xander.

At first, Dante didn’t believe her until she sent a photo.

It was a photo of a pair of lacy panties.

They looked familiar. I’d worn them the night before Dante left on his last trip.

Thinking it might be a misunderstanding, I quickly explained, “Dante, those aren’t mine.”

But hearing that only made him angrier.

He stormed over, snatched the phone from my hand, tapped the screen a couple of times, then grabbed my hair and shoved the phone right in front of my eyes.

“Take a good look. If they’re not yours, then whose are they?”

On the screen was another photo. This time, one side of the panties had the words “Dante only” embroidered on them.

My mind went blank, and my face turned pale.

“T-That’s impossible. I threw them away after showing them to you. How could they possibly...”

Then I remembered—Dante’s mother, Aveline, had a strange habit of wearing my clothes without permission.

Once, I came home early and found her standing topless in front of my closet, picking through my wardrobe.

When I asked her about it, she claimed she’d walked into the wrong room.

After she left, I noticed one of my lace panties on the floor.

Could it have been Aveline who wore them?

I looked up at Dante and said, “I know who wore them—it was your mother.”

“How dare you!” Dante exploded and hit me hard in the leg. “Of all people, you choose to slander my mom? Why would she wear your underwear at her age?”

“And she’s the former Luna! Show some respect!”

My legs gave out and I dropped to the floor.

He raised his hand and hit me—again and again.

My mother panicked and rushed over, grabbing his arm. “Dante, please stop! This has to be a misunderstanding. Let’s sit down and talk it through, please!”

“Get out of my face!” Dante shoved her aside without hesitation.

She fell to the floor.

“Mom!” I cried out, glaring at him. “Dante, you crazy man! My mom has a back injury. If you hurt her, my dad won’t let you off.”

My father was a werewolf police. Even though Alphas were powerful, they were still subject to werewolf law.

Dante knew this—but he had already lost all control.

“Your mom gave birth to a filthy woman like you. She must be a filthy woman herself. Maybe your dad should be thanking me for teaching her a lesson!”

By now, a crowd had gathered outside our door.

“What’s going on?”

“Sounds like Dominic’s daughter cheated on her mate.”

“That can’t be. Dominic’s such an upright guy, how could he have raised a daughter like this?”

As the gossip grew louder, one man finally couldn’t take it anymore and stepped forward.

“Alpha, calm down. Luna’s carrying a child. Hitting a woman, especially one carrying a child, is beyond cruel.”

Dante turned and glared at him. “This isn’t your business. Let’s see how calm you are when your wife cheats on you.”

After yelling at him, Dante faced the crowd and shouted, “This is my private business. Even if the werewolf police come, at worst it’s domestic violence. But if anyone dares to meddle or call the cops—once I’m done here, I’ll pay you a visit.”

He let out a low growl, his Alpha aura radiating from his entire body.

At those words, the crowd melted away. Nobody wanted to get involved in this mess.

“Renna, you cheat on me and you even expect me to raise that guy’s child? Do you think I’m a fool?”

His eyes burned into my body.

I’d never seen Dante like this—a feral beast, raw murder in his gaze.

Instinctively, I covered my stomach and softened my voice.

“Honey, I swear I didn’t cheat. If you don’t believe me, call Xander. Ask him who really brought those panties into his bed.”

He sneered. “Xander? You call him that so sweet, not even ‘Alpha Xander.’ You think he’s coming to save you? Dream about it. Luna Sienna’s already got a dozen men waiting for him. He’s got bigger fish to fry.”

Dante’s eyes shifted to the wall, where my father had hung his treasured baseball bat. He took it down and gripped in his hand.

“When exactly did you start doing it with Xander?” he asked coldly.

“I didn’t,” I replied, shaking my head.

“Still lying, huh?”

He raised the baseball bat.

I screamed and shut my eyes.

The baseball bat cracked against something—but I didn’t feel any pain.

I opened my eyes.

Despite what is now almost 2 months of at least 6 hours, *I* can't sleep that long in some cruel twist of fate. I wake up about every sleep cycle- so every 90-120 minutes. Last night I fell asleep at about 8:30 and woke up at 10, 11:30, 1:30, 3, and then 4 when baby was up. 

The baby is usually quiet when I wake up, so it's not them.

I sleep with ear plugs, white noise/a fan, and melatonin. During pregnancy I also had this sort of waking up issue and took unisom for it, by I stopped that when the baby was born because it made me too sleepy if I didn't sleep for a full night. Before pregnancy I never had an issue like this.

I sleep in the nursery with the baby, my husband sleeps in our bedroom across the hall. I've been thinking of trying to go back to my bed now, but 6 months of room sharing is recommended for SIDS. 

I might try switching out the melatonin for unisom again just to see if it helps now without making me too tired. But I don't want to get back on unisom then hit a sleep regression where I need to be alert.

1knyfog,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1knyfog/kendu_the_first_brandcoin/,Kendu - The First Brandcoin,"Kendu, a coin backed by  an insane community, who relentlessly pushes the coin forwards and strives for a better future for each other, has recently broken a year long down trend. Redistributing a massive amount of tokens from early whales to the average holder, I personally have lowered my average purchase from well of 100 million to a market cap of just 20 million!

I am not selling anytime soon and I know there’s thousands of other people like me.

**Why choose Kendu**

Ask yourself this? What did Shiba Inu, Pepe and other billion dollar memecoins have in common? Was it a funny meme? Was it favoured by KOLs? Was there bots? What was it?

It was because they were backed by a solid community, who dominated and took over social media. Kendu is very similar but we are changing the game, we have expanded past social media and are now creating real life products.

But anyways, is Kendu taking over social media?

Yes, we are. I am 100% sure you have at least heard of us on social media over the past year, if you’re reading this you probably haven’t bought Kendu, but here is your chance.

With our catalogue of IRL products and events, retail will run to us. For newcomers, something physical will make a world of difference since it shows that Kendu is more than just a few numbers on a screen, it is a real-life movement that will spread across the planet!



**IRL Initiatives**

* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. The other 2 festivals, was Miami Music Week and Miami Art Basel. At these festivals, murals were created, Kendu energy cocktails were given out and Kendu merch was given out!
* We have also will be having a Kendu Hot Dog stand in Florida soon
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport. There has recently been a media drop from these events. There is also talks of parties coming soon!
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peeks. I think it will be available on Steam.
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art

Since we have worked so hard, on our social media efforts, a lot of people are watching Kendu and at the first sign of green, there will be so much FOMO and the pump will be insane.

A particular achievement that I am most proud of, is the fact that Kendu reached 50k Certik votes, the 2^(nd) coin to ever do so….The first coin was Pepe(that reached 10 billion outside of a bull run), Certik also rates Kendu’s community as 98/100, I haven’t seen a coin with a higher score, especially not at 22 million market cap. Kendu has so much room to grow and we will do it with, or without you. But I’d rather do it with you!

You can find me in the telegram as Luke Skywalker and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have(but there is hundreds of other people who will also be happy to do so!)

So what are you waiting for? Join the Pack!

We Don't Gamble, We Work

1knyfg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1knyfg4/advice_on_upgrading10002000/,advice on upgrading[£1000-£2000],"Hi everyone! Hope you’re all having a great day :) I’d like some advice on upgrading my coffee station!

I’m currently using the Sage (or Breville) Barista Express, I’ve had it for a few years and honestly, I’ve never been able to get on well with it. I’m a barista professionally, not just at home, so I’m used to professional level machines for the large majority of my coffee crafting time, which is perhaps why I find using my home machine frustrating and slow.

I’d like to start off with buying a separate grinder as the one on the machine isn’t fantastic in my opinion, and I also brew filter and moka often which it isnt really designed for. I’ve been looking at the Mahlkönig x54 grinder as I’ve heard it’s good for both espresso and filter, and the fact that it’s a stepless grinder is a pro for me :)

I’m just struggling to find the right coffee machine for me! I’m not looking to buy a new one immediately, I was just going to focus on getting the grinder first and then saving up for a fancier machine later on in the year. I’ve been looking at the Bezzera machines ( specifically the BZ10 and the Magica S PID), does anyone have any experience with these machines and would they recommend either one? My absolute dream machine is the La Marzocco Linea Mini but it’s crazy expensive and I am not quite in the financial position to buy such a machine at this point in my life :(

Just looking for a discussion and advice really, if anyone has any other recommendations please let me know! I love brewing a range of coffees depending on my mood of the day, so I’d say something with a really decent steam wand is a definite must for me :)

Also, I’m in the UK if that changes anything advice wise.

Thanks and happy brewing!!",1,1747394753.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1knyf6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_radiant_pillar_55/comments/1knyf6i/the_collapse_point/,The Collapse Point,"Chapter One: The Equation That Shouldn’t Work

It began with a glitch in the math.

Dr. Alan Kesler sat at his desk in the small physics lab tucked beneath the main campus of Westridge University. The room smelled of ozone and stale coffee. Scattered notebooks, pages half-filled with scrawled equations, littered the space around his monitor. He hadn’t slept in 19 hours, and his fingertips were stained with black ink and graphite.

He was trying to solve a problem that, by all accounts, had already been solved.

The quantum measurement problem—why observation caused wavefunction collapse. The foundation of how the quantum world snapped into classical form when measured.

Only his model wasn’t collapsing.

It was predicting collapse.

With certainty.

Which shouldn’t be possible.

“Come on,” he muttered, eyes locked on the simulation running on his terminal. “Where are you breaking?”

He entered the last few variables. The system blinked, then returned the same result as the last seven times:

Observation initiated. Collapse determined. Path selected.

The system wasn’t calculating probability. It was treating quantum behavior like a codebase—with input and output logic. Deterministic. Programmatic.

Alan leaned back slowly.

He didn’t believe in pseudoscience. He believed in equations, in experiments. But this? This simulation didn’t behave like it was modeling quantum uncertainty.

It behaved like it was reading from a script.



Over the next week, Alan repeated the test 3,700 times using randomly-generated conditions.
Each time, the system collapsed the wavefunction before the observation event.
Before the “observer” component was introduced.

It was as if the system already knew what he was going to do.
And more than that—
As if the system needed him to do it in order to validate its logic.

As if his choices weren’t choices at all.



Chapter Two: The Pattern

Alan started noticing… rhythms.

Not just in his data. In everything.

The timing of car horns outside his apartment.
The patterns of birds in the sky.
How conversations with strangers always seemed to end in the same three ways.

He recorded these things obsessively, trying not to fall into paranoia. But the data didn’t lie. Every variable he studied—from random number generators to Geiger counters—began displaying what he could only describe as precognitive symmetry.

It was like the universe was predicting itself.

Or worse:

Running a script with built-in compression.

And observation—the act of perceiving reality—was just the trigger that decompressed the next necessary frame.



That was when he re-examined the source of his simulation’s anomaly: a small routine in the code labeled Ψ-Collapse.

He hadn’t written it.

It wasn’t in the original library files.
But it executed flawlessly, spitting out answers that conformed to reality perfectly—too perfectly.

He opened the routine.

There was no code.

Just a single line:

Reality only exists when you look.",1,1747394728.0,u_radiant_pillar_55,0,1.0,False

We matched, and immediately he was all smiles and charming as heck. But then, just as I'm getting comfortable with his decent banter, he unleashes what I can only describe as the weirdest message barrage ever. It was like suddenly being in the hot seat on a talk show where the only guest is me and the host is a guy I just virtually met.

First question: ""What's the most defining moment of your childhood?"" I was like... excuse me? 😅 Then he moved on to, ""What are your deepest fears in life?"" Are these rapid-fire questions or some weird personality test? By the time he asked about my thoughts on the existential meaning of life, I was convinced he was moonlighting as an unlicensed therapist.

Don't get me wrong, I love a deep convo as much as the next person, but maybe after the first coffee or, idk, 3-to-5 legitimate dates? At least lead with a ""Hey, how's your day been?"" before deep-diving into my psyche!

But alas, curiosity got the better of me (also a lil' boredom, let's be real), so I threw back a playful ""What's your spirit animal or vegetables, if you're into that?"" and unsurprisingly... never heard from him again. 😂 Classic case of match-made ghost~",2,1747394530.0,OnlineDatingStory,0,1.0,False

1kny9js,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1kny9js/sanctuary_of_the_dry_bones/,Sanctuary of the Dry Bones,"The sanctuary lights hummed like a tired hymn that Sunday evening. Pastor Voss gripped the pulpit, his sermon on Ezekiel's dry bones landing heavy on shoulders already bent beneath the weight of harvest season and hospital bills. The ""Amens"" came slow these days, more sigh than shout.



Grace Cargill moved through the church like she was still learning how to walk on solid ground. Her brother's dog tags hung from her rearview mirror, catching the light when she parked her rusted Silverado in the same spot every Sunday. She started arriving early to wipe coffee rings from the fellowship hall tables, the ones left by men who'd argued too long about the budget last Wednesday night.



When she suggested repairing the steps at the Henderson place, Carl Mueller set his jaw. ""Jim never darkened our door much.""



Grace kept counting nails into a coffee can. ""His wife sat with my mama reading Psalms every afternoon that last month."" The metallic rattle filled the silence until Miss Talbot reached for her checkbook.



The work crews moved at first like strangers at a funeral - all stiff shoulders and swallowed words. Men who'd once raised barns before lunch now measured twice and still sawed crooked. Women who knew each other's pound cake recipes by heart passed tools without meeting eyes.



Then the Mercer boys started showing up - skinny kids in Walmart jeans, their mama working nights at the feed store. Grace put them to work sorting donated clothes, paying them in gas money and jars of her grandmother's pickled okra.



Deacon Greer watched them shooting hoops with a sagging net. ""We're not running a youth program here.""



Grace didn't look up from untangling extension cords. ""No,"" she said. ""We're supposed to be the hands and feet of Jesus.""



By revival season, something had eased. Not fixed - just settled, like flour after sifting.



Brother Hank threw out his back helping old Henderson onto the new steps. Jim handed him a paper bag of early tomatoes after, and neither mentioned Hank's boy who'd been in and out of jail.



The night the ice storm knocked out power, half the congregation wound up in the basement with the emergency generator. Grace found Pastor Voss staring at the bulletin board where someone had pinned last quarter's giving report.



""They're weary,"" she said.



He didn't turn around. ""Of what?""



""Of fighting alone.""



Outside, the ice snapped pine branches like rifle shots. Inside, the Mercer boys slept under choir robes, their palms still dirty from digging Miss Talbot's car out of the ditch that afternoon.



Come morning, the sun would rise on the same cracked parking lot. The old divisions would creep back with the coffee brewing. But when Pastor Voss unlocked his office at dawn, he found a rough wooden cross on his desk - the kind only beginners would leave unsanded, the nails slightly crooked where young hands had driven them.



He ran his thumb along the grain as the first light hit the baptistry waters, turning them gold.

The very existence of paid GMs proves that they offer a necessary and valuable service.

What's actually bugging me is that in the last few years new and even returning players have started occasionally offering to pay me for games. Dude, you may interest me with a game but you can't *hire* me.

My opinion on paid GMing per se is devoid of value because I'm not part of it. But this expectation that *I* am for hire as well? *This* is what's actually been bugging me about paid GMing for the last 25+ years of playing TTRPGs.

Does anyone share this sentiment or is it just me? It feels like it's time to make this a part of the gaming subculture: don't offer to pay unless you know the GM is for hire.

*****

**Responses to responses**

>People value your work and express it with money, what's wrong with that?

I am not for hire. Interesting players who put in the effort don't owe me anything, and if you aren't one, our table space is not for rent. You may interest me as a player, but you can't just *purchase* my company for the evening. This is the default, and assuming otherwise is impolite.

>Paying is impolite, but treating the GM to pizza or buying a book is fine.

I agree. ""The pizza is on the players"" is a maxim I've supported for over two decades. Even when we were 17 year olds, the pizza was on the players and prep was on me. They didn't *owe* me food, but it's customary to treat the GM just like it's customary to not charge your friend for coffee when they visit—which is very different from trying to somberly and politely stick a fiddy in my pocket for the trouble.

**Chapter 1**

After Giovanni Jennings’ cold demeanor during yet another difficult evening, I stumbled upon two theater tickets tucked in his coat pocket.

He said with an air of indifference, ""I was planning a surprise for your birthday, but since you found out, let’s meet this weekend.""

The weekend arrived, and I dressed up, excited for our long-awaited night out. I waited until the end of the performance, but Giovanni never showed up.

Checking my phone, I saw a message from his childhood friend on Instagram: ""Even though you missed the show, seeing someone brave the pouring rain to watch it means I can forgive you.""

In the past, I would have called Giovanni immediately, upset and demanding an explanation. I’d have let my emotions take over, crying and frustrated. But tonight, I was simply exhausted from the constant cycle.

The thunderstorm that hit was unlike anything I had ever seen. The city was paralyzed, and the theater doors were locked. Without an umbrella and unable to hail a taxi, I reluctantly began walking, struggling in my high heels.

As the rain poured down, my phone buzzed. It was Giovanni, calling. His voice was sharp with impatience: ""Where are you? It’s almost midnight, and a married woman like you is still out?""

My silence only made him more frustrated. ""Are you mute, Hailey Rosario?""

""I’m at Massey Theatre,"" I replied.

Giovanni seemed to remember the plans we’d made, and after a brief pause, he finally said, ""Send me your location. I’m on my way.""

I had no intention of waiting for him, but before I could move any further, someone bumped into me, and I lost my balance, falling into a pile of mud. My left ankle swelled, and I could hardly walk.

It took an hour and twenty-three minutes for Giovanni to respond, but by the time he did, I was too exhausted and upset. My phone was about to die, and there was no further message from him.

I finally found a kind driver who took me to a nearby hotel, where I charged my phone. I instinctively checked Macey Rivas’ Instagram, and saw her post from half an hour ago: “Power outage? No problem. There were knights escorting this princess back to the castle.”

The photo showed Macey with her father and Giovanni, sipping coffee together. That was the final straw. I blocked and deleted Macey’s profile. After a brief pause, I also blocked Giovanni’s.

Six years of marriage—no matter how many arguments or silent treatments, I had never deleted Giovanni from my life. But this time, I was truly done.

The next morning, I arrived at work only to be met with an odd look from my boss. ""The HR department mentioned you took a sick day today. Giovanni, the vice chairman, personally requested it.""

I smiled, assuring them I wasn’t sick, but it was clear Giovanni had orchestrated this.

During lunch, as I was making coffee, Giovanni appeared unexpectedly. He had worked at the top level of the company for years, and never once had he come down to visit me during the workday. But today, he did. His face was neutral, but I could sense the underlying tension.

""Was it fun staying out all night?"" he asked, his voice laced with frustration. ""You know how I feel about this, Hailey. If there’s another time like this...""

I interrupted, my voice calm but resolute, ""Don’t worry. There won’t be a next time.""

I had made up my mind. It was time for a change.

Looking at my serene face, Giovanni was taken aback. He hadn’t expected me to speak so calmly.

After brewing his coffee, Giovanni frowned as he tasted it. He disliked it and quickly poured it out. ""Let’s meet after work. Come to the parking lot. I’ll take you out to dinner.""

It was clear this was his attempt at making up for standing me up the night before. I had something to say to him too, so I replied simply, ""Okay.""





**Chapter 2**

Back at my desk, I noticed the milk tea desserts that my colleagues had placed on the table, with a sticky note that read, ""Happy birthday, Hailey.""

I turned slightly and wiped my eyes quietly, trying to keep my composure.

After enjoying the sweet dessert, I focused on my work until the end of the day. As per Giovanni’s instructions, I headed to the parking lot.

When I saw him, he didn’t stop the car. He drove right past me without a glance.

Giovanni called me from the car, saying he had a last-minute meeting and asked me to go ahead to the restaurant and wait for him.

When I arrived at the restaurant, I didn’t waste time. I ordered my favorite red wine steak and made myself comfortable. Over the years, I had grown accustomed to waiting when it came to Giovanni—he was always busy. My stomach, which had started acting up from stress, had only worsened over time.

The steak was delicious, and even though Giovanni stood me up again, I didn’t feel angered, just… tired.

Later that night, Giovanni finally returned home. He noticed the lights in the hallway and living room were off, and for the first time in years, he found that I wasn’t waiting up for him.

In the past, whenever he went out for late nights or business gatherings, I’d always stay up, waiting to help him when he got back, preparing hangover medicine, and resting on the couch.

But that night, I wasn’t there.

Giovanni seemed a little taken aback. “Hailey, are you feeling unwell?” he asked, his hand reaching for my forehead.

I pulled away from his touch, not wanting to engage in the usual routine anymore. “It’s late. You should take a shower.”

The smell of drinking on him made me nauseous. He sat beside me and checked his phone, noting that there were no missed calls.

“It's strange,” he muttered, “I always thought you enjoyed making sure I didn’t drink too much when I was out.""

He cleared his throat and looked at me. ""I really couldn’t refuse that dinner, but I’ll make it up to you tomorrow. Let’s have dinner together then, okay?""

I blinked at him. “No need. You should take care of your own things.”

I meant it from the bottom of my center. But instead of understanding, I was met with Giovanni’s cold sneer.

“Hailey,” he said, his voice filled with mockery, “Give you a little freedom and you’re already trying to do everything on your own. I’ve been busy lately. I don’t have time to cater to every little thing.”

As he spoke, my phone beeped with a new email notification. I couldn't resist, I opened the screen to read the message. Without thinking, I whispered, “It’s impressive how you can manage your time so well—movies and coffee in the middle of your busy schedule.”

Giovanni’s face darkened, and he began to explain in an irritated tone, ""Macey's afraid of the dark. I had to take her home last night. She needed me.""

I didn’t respond. Instead, I silently held my phone, reading a document that had been sent to me earlier—the divorce agreement.

Giovanni’s voice grew louder as he continued, “Hailey, are you even listening? You’ve really disappointed me.""

But I didn’t react the way he expected. I didn’t cry or try to convince him of my feelings.

I had already decided that I deserved better.

Without saying another word, I quickly locked my phone screen as I heard Giovanni move closer.

“What were you looking at?” he demanded.

“Nothing,” I replied, my voice calm. “I’m just tired. I’m going to sleep now.”

With a loud thud, Giovanni stormed into his study and locked the door behind him. This was the beginning of the Cold War, the silence that would soon follow.

If this had been a year ago, I would have begged him to talk, to communicate. I would have knelt at the door, pleading for him to listen.

But tonight, I wasn’t going to do that. Tonight, I was choosing to protect my own peace of mind.





**Chapter 3**

That night, there were no tears. Instead, I printed out the divorce agreement, signed it, and placed it in the bedside drawer. Turning off the lights, I, a long-time insomniac, managed to get a good night’s sleep for the first time in a long while.

The next day, Giovanni called me from the office and asked me to come up to the top floor.

When I arrived, Macey was sitting at the boss’s desk, her innocent smile on full display as she cupped her cheeks. “I always used to ask Giovanni to bring you along, but he never listened,” she said.

Macey, an internet celebrity, was young, beautiful, and always dressed to the nines. Every time I saw her, I’d feel a twinge of insecurity, wishing I could be more like her. But today? There was no trace of self-doubt in my eyes.

I smiled at her warmly. “I’m just a homebody. Don’t worry about me; it’s more important that you two enjoy yourselves.”

Giovanni turned his gaze toward me from the French windows, his tired eyes hinting at a restless night. “Hailey, Macey is hungry. Can you give her my lunch?” he said, as if everything was normal.

For years, I had prepared his lunch with care—always different, always made with love. But just last week, I overheard him complaining to his assistant that the meals I made were so bad even the dog wouldn’t eat them. “This is the consequence of marrying the wrong woman,” he had said.

I took a deep breath and responded, keeping my tone neutral, “I didn’t prepare lunch today.”

Giovanni, shocked, asked, “Why didn’t you prepare lunch? You know I only eat the food you make.”

Macey smirked and added, “Giovanni, you must have done something to upset Hailey. Otherwise, why would she let you go hungry?”

Giovanni’s expression darkened for a moment, but then he asked what I wanted to eat and instructed his assistant to order takeout.

“No need,” I replied. “Just order what Macey likes. I’ll find something nearby.”

I turned to leave, but Giovanni quickly grabbed his jacket and tried to follow me without a word.

This time, I didn’t let him.

During the meal, Giovanni and Macey chatted about their childhood, about people and experiences I didn’t understand. I tried to join in, to make them laugh, but every time I spoke, Giovanni’s impatience was palpable. At first, he looked down on me, thinking I couldn’t keep up with the conversation. Later, he accused me of being aloof and intentionally ignoring his childhood friend.

Realizing I couldn’t win either way, I chose to stay silent and focused only on enjoying the food.

After the meal, I went to the restroom. When I returned, Macey had already left.

Giovanni looked at me with a smile. “Hailey, you had a good appetite today.”

He smiled as he glanced at my stomach. I reached out and removed a false eyelash from his cheek.

I didn’t wear false eyelashes.

Giovanni’s eyes widened, and for the first time, he looked panicked. “Don’t get the wrong idea,” he said quickly, “Macey just had something in her eye, and I had to get close to help her.”

His nervousness was unmistakable, but I didn’t say a word. I nodded, then turned to walk away.

Giovanni stood still for a moment, then hurried to catch up with me.

As we approached the company building, I said without looking back, “I’ll go in first. You can come back to the office in a few minutes.”",1,1747393941.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

**Fran**

Fran sat in the conference room, watching N’ren and Xar. The other Xenni didn’t seem like they were thinking much about the things that *Longview* had just said. She had known the basics, they were a warship built long ago for a war that never happened, but she had no idea that *Longview* still had their weapons. She wondered how often they were tested and if they were maintained. 

Both N’ren and Xar seemed surprised at the revelation. N’ren’s ears were flat, and Xar kept trying to keep his claws from shaking. The fact that *Longview* was two thousand years old didn’t feel like it should be such a surprise to Fran, but she supposed this was just more of the differences that happen in a cultural exchange. 

<It’s probably time for them to retire to their own ships, it’s nearly the end of the day shift> *Longview* sent her. 

Fran stood. “It’s just about the end of our day shift here. People will be changing shifts and eating their meals. Why don’t you two retire to your own ships and rest, and we can reconvene tomorrow and see how well the replacement parts are working. N’ren, your parts should be just about finished by then, and we’ll have worked out how to help Xar.”

“Er, yes, that seems like the best course of action,” Xar rumbled as he and his assistant stood as well. “Francine, please extend our thanks to your captain for the assistance and the invitation to see your ship. It has been… illuminating.”

“Uh, I do have one question,” the other Xenni, - Fran thought his name was Yishem - said. “*Longview*, you still have your relativistic engines. Do you ever use them?”

“Oh! Well, no, not really anymore. With the wormhole generators, they’re not really necessary anymore. I still maintain them, and they’re still up to specifications. That is to say, if needed, they would fire and work fine, but we don’t have much of a need for them anymore.”

“Why not remove them then? You would gain more cargo space, would you not?”

“Ye-es, I would,” *Longview* said. Fran could tell they were choosing their words carefully. “But, they are a part of me. Even if I don’t need them anymore, they’re still *me*.”

“I see.” Yishem’s carapace flexed once. A nod? Something else? “Thank you for your answer.”

Fran led the visitors back to the airlock, and Xar and Yishem walked confidently back to their ship without so much as a look back. N’ren hung back, staring at her ship. Fran noticed her ears were twitching, and her tail swishing. Was she agitated? “N’ren, is something wrong?” She asked.

“No, I suppose not.” N’ren said. “It’s just…” She sighed. Fran was surprised, the gesture sounded so human. “I slept with the captain, and she thinks it’s practically a declaration of a relationship! It’s much more than I do. It was just… some fun, a way to relax. If I go back, I’ll have to deal with it, and I don’t want to.” She sighed again. “I need to deal with it, but it’s going to turn into a fight - if I’m lucky. It will poison the rest of the tour. I’ll probably have to be rotated home immediately, again.”

Fran blinked. <*Longview, was that translation right?*\>

<To the best of my ability, yes it was.>

“I- hmmm.” Fran thought trying to vamp while her mind raced.

N’ren squeaked and her fur stood straight out. “Ancestors! I admitted all that to you! A human! Out loud! Oh nononononono,” N’ren started shaking. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, you don’t have to deal with any of that, please forget I said anything.”

“N’ren, it’s all right.” Fran said. “I don’t mind, I’m happy you felt comfortable enough with us to be so… vulnerable.” Fran reached out towards N’ren and then stopped. She shouldn’t touch her, she had no idea what cultural thing they might or might not have about touch. She just looked like she… needed a hug. “I’ll tell you what,” Fran continued. “What if we… needed you to stay overnight to… help with the inspection of the parts? Then you can stay here. We’ll give you a cabin and you can sleep here if you need to - we don’t know your requirements for rest, but then you won’t have to go back to your ship and you can work out a way to… break the news to your Captain.” Fran smiled weakly.

N’ren looked up at Fran, her large eyes wet. *Was she crying? Do they cry too?* “You would do that for me? Someone you just met? Not even the same species?”

Fran nodded “Of course. You’re our friend. Friends help each other. I’ll get Captain Erlatan to contact your captain and let her know.”

”No!” N’ren said, too loudly, and then stopped. “No, I mean, would *you* do it, Fran? I would prefer that as few people as possible know about my… poor decision making skills when it comes to romantic partners.”

“S-sure N’ren, I’ll call her.” Fran pinged *Longview* <You’re hearing this, do you think it’s fine for me to call their captain, or should you do it through *Menium*?>

*<Fran are you sure this is wise? This is N’ren’s problem, not ours.>*

<*Longview*! Listen to yourself. She needs our help! Sure, she needs it to… avoid someone she slept with that she probably shouldn’t have, but she still needs help, and she’s our friend.>

*<This feels like a BI thing to me, I don’t want to get involved.>*

<BI?>

*<Biological Intelligence. You call us AIs, we call you BIs.>*

<Oh, interesting!… Is it an insult?>

*<Can be.>* Longview admitted. *<It’s all about context.>*

N’ren was staring up at Fran while it looked like she was staring off into space. Fran finally glanced down and saw her. “Oh! I’m sorry N’ren, I was talking with *Longview* subvocal about options. They don’t want to get involved, so I’ll call your captain.”

“They don’t want to get involved?” N’ren said, curious. “What do you mean? You can’t order them?”

“Me? No, I’m just a lieutenant, I can barely order anyone around.”

“No,” N’ren’s ears twitched and she did that half shrug. “I mean, you’re not an AI, but they… are?”

Fran stared at N’ren, trying to parse what she said. *<She’s wondering if I’m subordinate to humans.>* *Longview* added.

“Oh! No, *Longview* is a fully legal, independent person with all rights and responsibilities included. They’re an AI, not a *slave*.”

“No, I didn’t mean-” N’ren started and then stopped. “I apologize. I misunderstood.”

“It’s all right, N’ren. *Menium* and I have spoken about their status compared to mine.” *Longview* did not elaborate further, and Fran was somewhat afraid to ask.

“Er, *Longview*? Can you please connect me with N’ren’s captain?”

“Yes, Fran. Her name is Captain Ko-tas Weniar.”

Fran waited a moment and then she heard to click of an open mic. “This is Captain Weniar, do you need something?”

“Yes! Oh, hello! I am Francine Sharma, Diplomatic Corps, but you can call me Fran. I’m the official liaison between humanity and the K’laxi for now. Normally, I’d be sending N’ren back to your ship as our day shift is ending, but we would like for her to stay longer, so that she can assist with the printing and inspection of your replacement parts.” Fran tried not to babble, and nearly hurt her neck clenching her muscles, trying to speak slowly.

“Well, she’s hardly an expert on starship hardware, I can send one of my engineers to-”

“No no! That’s quite all right.” Fran said quickly, “I think N’ren’s specific skills are exactly what we need right now.”

There was a pause on the line so long that Fran was worried they were disconnected. “If… you think that her expertise is best, then… all right, she can stay through the rest period.” Captain Weniar said. Fran wondered if *Menium* was adding something to the normally flat translation, because the Captain sounded disappointed. 

“Thank you so much Captain Weniar! She really is needed. We’ll send her back as soon as we can.” Fran said, and Longview disconnected the call. 

“I would like the record to state that I do not approve of this action.” *Longview* said aloud, “But I do not approve so much that I feel the need to stop you or get Captain Erlatan involved.”

“Noted *Longview*.” Fran said. “And thanks.” She turned to N’ren. “Okay, you have permission to stay with us tonight, you don’t have to go back.”

N’ren’s ears pointed straight up, and she ran into Fran’s arms. “Oh, thank you thank you thank you! It’s my own mess, but you’re helping me even though you don’t have to!”

*She really is soft.* Fran thought, as she patted N’ren and returned the hug. 

In order to keep up the fiction, Fran brought N’ren back to the printing hall, and she did spend some time inspecting the parts. She looked at them from all angles, and even asked a few questions to the engineers. “These are impressive! They look K’laxi!”

“I mean,” The engineer said, grinning. “We’re using your plans. They effectively *are* K’laxi.”

“Amazing.” N’ren said. She looked over at Fran. “These are - as near as I can tell - perfect. They’ll work as good as new!”

“Wonderful!” Fran said, grinning. She glanced down at the timepiece on her wrist. “And my - our - shift just ended. Come on, N’ren! Do you want to have something to eat?”

“Eat?” N’ren said. “Is it safe?”

“It absolutely is **not** safe.” *Longview* said, interrupting. “We have only the barest idea of K’laxi physiology and nutritional needs. *Menium* and I are working on it, but it was hardly a high priority thing until *someone* decided to take an interest in K’laxi sex life!” *Longview* sounded exasperated. 

“N’ren needed our help and she came to me when she was vulnerable.” Fran countered. “She’s our friend and I for one am happy to help her.”

“Yes, *I can see that*.” *Longview* said testily. 

“Well, she can’t *not* eat. Do we have anything she can safely consume?”

*Longview*’s sigh was long and dramatic. Fran could visualize them running their hands through their hair even though as far as she knew, they never had a body. “Wheat. *Menium* and I think wheat is fine. Nothing yeasted! I don’t know what yeast will do to K’laxi digestion. A flatbread; roti, paratha, something like that.”

“Parvatian cuisine?” Fran said, curiously.

“Cuisine from the country once called India, actually. It’s just that Parvati was settled by many people from that area. Any flatbread would work, I just know we have those aboard.” Longview said. 

“What about something to drink?” Fran said. 

“She can drink distilled water” Longview said, firmly. 

“Just water? Come on, there has to be something.”

“Saints above *and below* Fran! Are you trying to **kill** her? We have *no idea* what our food will to do her digestion. Did you know caffeine is toxic to most Earth animals? It is almost certainly toxic to her. It’s not like we can give her a coffee, some chips and a tomato salsa for dipping; we’d kill her three times over!”

“What about an herbal tea?” Fran said, desperately. “I want to be a good host.”

“**Arrrrgh**. Let me talk with *Menium*.”

Fran led N’ren through the chow line trying to ignore the stares of the crew as she took a tray and passed by all the foods until they got to the tray of breads, and Fran selected her two small roti, and they went to a seat. 

“Staying for dinner?” One of the crew said, as they walked by a table. “Don’t bother with the chocolate cake, that thing probably hasn’t been within thirty lights of chocolate!” The whole table laughed.

N’ren looked at Fran and her ears twitched. 

“Don’t even *think* about it.” *Longview* said.

They sat, and N’ren carefully took a small bite of the bread, chewing it thoughtfully. Her eyes widened and she took a much larger bite. “This is amazing!” She said, around a mouthful of food. “I’ve never had anything that tastes like this before!”

Fran smiled and ate her butter chicken. 

N’ren went through five more roti before *Longview* pinged them again.

“Chamomile.” They said flatly.

“What?” Fran said

“Chamomile. *Menium* and I are in agreement. Chamomile tea is probably fine for her physiology. But that’s it. I’m not looking into anything further.”

“You’re the best, *Longview*! I owe you!”

“You do, yes.”

1kny2i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1kny2i7/caffeine_intake_after_quit_smoking/,Caffeine intake after quit smoking,"Hello fellow quitters from the day 178.

I smoked cigs 20 years and last 2 years one pack a day.

This is my second message on this sub. I want to give another relapse prevention tip which works for me and hoping it will also work for you.

When I was smoking cigs I drank 2 liter (nearly 66 ounces ) caffee and 1 liter (~33 ounces) black tea. And all this contains around 1000mg caffeine. 

No problem. I can handle it easily, my body get over it. I really enjoy it. Even just before sleeping I can drink coffee. 

But after quit smoking this becomes my main problem. I later noticed (around day 70) at least half of my anxiety, extreme anger, panics, mood changes, very little night sleep and bad sleep are caused from extreme caffeine intake.

This makes me crazy because everyone who quitted before told me after one month of quitting it is much more manageable, but my experience is exactly the opposite. The anger, sleepless nights, anxiety, panic attacs, mood changes, jitters... are less from day three of quitting but not much more less than I expected and what I read before. I didn't still have no inner peace. 

Long story short I searched from Google and found that nicotine eliminates caffeine much more faster from the body and my caffeine consumption after quit smoking is too much. My body can't eliminate caffeine faster like before because of quit smoking. I have no idea from this  before searching it and just drinking usual daily dosage for me. So I made myself caffeine overdose unintentionally everyday.

After learning this I limited my caffeine consumption. One cup of coffee and 1 or 2 cups of black tea is enough for me now and my quitting attempt much more manageable; almost no anger, no sleepless nights, less anxiety, less panic. Actually everything is more manageable. 

I just want to share that because it helps me very much. I hope this also works for you if you consume unintentionally more caffeine like me. 

Best wishes and kind regards. Good luck 🍀",5,1747393479.0,quittingsmoking,2,1.0,False

I look back on that now and realize how little I truly knew myself or what I wanted at the time. My words were pregnant with judgement and self depreciation. 

Now I sit here laughing at myself for looking up the same thing I gave advice on and realizing I know nothing. I like it when I get to come to this conclusion, it helps dismantle the ego. 

I’m very thankful for all that you have done, especially over the past few weeks. I won’t mention that thing I’ve been a little upset about this week, I’ll just express my gratitude to the parts that are handling that with such grace and integrity. Thank you for trusting my emotional maturity to handle this well, I see the immense work you are doing and it is astonishingly impressive. 

Thank you for showing me how truly wrong I have been in my assumptions about you, not loudly and going off as I have done, but calmly. Taking my hand and showing me kindly my errors in who I have thought you to be, while also showering me in love and adoration. I am enjoying this process of learning to love you greater and in better ways, as I peel back the layers of projection and see you for who you really are. 

I am in uncharted waters, and I find I like who I am in the face of uncertainty these days. I do not feel needy or attention seeking when ignored, I simply take that as a time for self reflection and to attend to the things in life I am responsible for. 

Speaking of, I need coffee and the quiet of the morning to get some things done before the day really starts. I hope you are enjoying the birdsong as the sun rises. It’s a new dawn today, with a hum of magic in the air like the day might bring more of the unexpected.

Hey everyone,

I'm exploring the idea of launching a decaf coffee brand in India, especially in the RTD (ready-to-drink) space — but before diving in, I’d love to get input from this community.

Here’s the quick context:

The Indian coffee market is growing (~$400M), but decaf is nearly invisible.

Rising health awareness, caffeine sensitivity, and sleep issues are creating space for low-stimulus beverages.

Urban consumers (especially 25–40) are shifting towards wellness — but decaf still lacks availability, awareness, and taste trust.


My question:
Is this a real opportunity, or too early for the Indian market? Even if decaf grabs 1% of the market in 3–5 years, that’s a ~$4M+ segment.

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially if you’re in F&B, D2C, or coffee retail.

1knxxc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1knxxc1/a_more_hopeful_future/,A more hopeful future?,"This may be a controversial opinion but… I am incredibly and intentionally hopeful about Starfields future. I have played every corner of the game, experienced all of its flaws, the immersion breaking lack of intersystem travel, the loading screens, the way outposts sometimes just won’t work…and yes Sarah’s personality. Could Bethesda have done better with its resources? Are there some things that could use a quick fix before they drive me crazy? Yes and yes, but I really think the level of Acceles dung hurled at the title is totally unjustified.

The game is packed full of good stuff, although I accept you have to have a particular mindset and patience to discover it. Despite its short comings I have found more than enough to keep me occupied and plenty of role play potential. As soon as I realised the dynamic of the NG+ I enjoyed treating each playthrough as part of a wider story in which I got to experience a different life, leaning into play styles I would never normally adopt. Some of the side quests have tapped into established sci-fi tropes allowing me a real feel of living a genre I have loved my entire life. Even the frustrating outpost system presented a fun challenge of finding resources, building networks and trying to get the whole damn thing running. I never imagined logistics could be so compelling.

If it remained the same I would still consider it a good buy. It kept me busy for over a year, for more time than the equivalent spend on movie tickets. I am on NG 11, and coming to the end of collecting everything, having done all the quests (tell me about save bloat right). My plan was to put it down until the DLC game out but strangely I find my self tempted to head back into the unity and begin again. Maybe I have a particular personality that is predisposed to filling the gaps games like this provide. I find it easy to throw myself into an imagined life and enjoy obsessive collection and completion, and even with the relatively small modding community I find things to do.

There are some great quest mods and I am really excited to get into farming with TG’s Harvest (finally able to live my xenobiologist zoo keeper fantasy!) We are just a few days away from Kingaths Watchtower which looks like a game changer. I was a huge fan of Sim settlements on Fallout 4 and knowing that they are making for starfield is a big motivation to keep playing. I can hear the grumbles already from the comments section, “why should we have to PAY for more content!?”.  Personally I don’t mind paying the price of a coffee for something that will extend my enjoyment, even if its just for a few more hours.  Do I think its entirely fair for Bethesda to take a cut? no, are there a lot of bad actors out there looking to make a quick buck? absolutely, but I am glad that people putting in work to extend the life of these games, get an opportunity to earn something.

As it stands it is a fantastic ‘base game’ designed with long term growth and collaboration in mind. Its balance between being a platform for such endeavours and a dependence on them is admittedly off.  It shouldn’t be the moders job to ‘complete’ or fix games for developers, but their work has always been an integral part of Bethesda games charm and longevity. Making a good game is not the work of the studio alone, It is achieved in the connection between, makers, modders and players who are willing to invest time, imagination and occasionally a few credits.

Sure the games got issues, but its also got ambition. I have being playing games since the 80’s. I played the original Elite and its sequel frontier (Which ironically did have very basic ‘proper’  Intersystem travel, be it far less complicated). I dreamt of games like Starfield. Even though I think it has further to reach, I find the commentary of the game baffling and destructive. Recurring comparisons to No Mans Sky or Cyberpunk, are chalk and cheese that suffer short memories. Both titles have been massively overhauled since release. No Mans Sky was called dead in space numerous times before its resurrection. Thankfully a dedicated core of fans and a committed team created something unique and loved.  In a similar vein I hope that Bethesda will continue to finesse the game, despite a vitriolic, repetitive and highly vocal section of the gaming community attempting to  to call time of death in every new ‘insightful’ post.

‘Critique’ often speaks far more of the commentators personal expectations, level of patience and way of imaginatively engaging with gaming. More broadly there is an inability to see the value of something that simply may not be for you. Starfield is complicated. It is tempting you to engage with multiple overlapping systems and expects its players to be thrilled by the technicality. It’s made for real nerds. There are tons of games that I don’t enjoy, but I am glad that their fans get to all the same. If you dislike Starfield so much, maybe you should get on with enjoying your day in another way and not continuing to stamp on it till its mush. It’s on game pass so need not be a huge investment to try and leave behond. I suspect the desire to trash the game might be because we actually want it to get better. If thats the case, focusing these forums on what would improve our enjoyment, rather than supposed ‘irredeemable’ failings will be more productive. My fear is that all the negativity may hastening a grav Jump into the blackness, and we may never get to see the game that Starfield has the potential to become.

For me it feels like Starfield is barely getting started. It‘s multiverse is young, its stories relatively undeveloped to the decades old franchises to which it is compared. I am looking forward to seeing what comes next from Bethesda and the creations community. I have a feeling that far from abandoning the title they are gearing up to surprise us. I would love more compelling narrative, writing and overall improved stability in future updates and DLC. I want to see the Major cities expanded, new planets, companions, Lore, factions and ways of playing that give me reason to step into Unity over and over again. Yet I also understand that all of that might not happen, and if it does it might take time. Maybe I will play other things while I wait, maybe I will get bored, thats ok too. I am still up for enjoying the journey and hope that that the road has the chance to grow longer.",6,1747392978.0,Starfield,8,0.69,False

Because he isn’t local to me I never met him irl. I was just bored and greatly upset about personal stuff and I just wanted means to escape. He happened to be there online. He let me share about my very private life I couldn’t share with my own social circle and he helped me emotionally. I was quite touched. So we got intimate on video...not my proudest moments but he healed me from my trauma I was experiencing at the time. He made me feel very beautiful and I loved the way he made me feel. But I said good bye to him a few days later since he wasn’t very friendly outside of bed, and he wasn’t very nice to me after, unavailable mostly and even rude. I felt cheap also. So I asked him not to contact me anymore (which he was greatly upset about sending me long texts..why did he treat me like that if he was remotely serious about me…). 

He reappeared on my contact list again in the chat a few months later because of a texting app upgrade I did on my phone. I just said hi I wasn’t aware he messaged me. I just sent a few messages and we started chatting again. Even though I told him I wasn’t interested in him like before, and because I want to date nicer men local to me, he claimed he wants to be my bf and all. That I’m his. And his only. I told him I just wanted to be friends, and he said he can’t just see me as a friend… 

I can’t see this man becoming like a real bf. When I told him that he was like “I can get a job in your country and can start living together after dating for a while long distance.” He apologized for making me feel cheap or hurt me etc. but again he’s like unavailable… And frankly it bothers me he doesn’t care if I’m satisfied or not. I’ve had phone/video sex with my ex boyfriends and they always care if I am satisfied and I care if he was too. I’ve been loved by men before. I know when they love me. But this guy only cares about himself. Like he hung up phone after he’s done and all. And once is accident, np. But second time third time…I don’t care what was going on around him it’s rude AF really. And he’s always busy with work he works crazy hours…

I’m talking to other men OLD platform. We never talk about sex. Not there yet and never intimate stuff yet (not even a kiss or handholding yet). Just talking as a friend. They’re very nice to me. A few coffee and dinner dates happened. They’re significantly more open about their job, life, family, and everything compared to him. And they’re successful men living here near me. Not thousands of miles away. I want to date nicer men I’m meeting on OLD platform. And I want a Bf who lives here eventually. 

Do you think I’m crazy that I’m talking to the guy who isn’t as nice and only care about sex and how pretty and beautiful I am so far away? He’s very superficial I think. As long as I’m hot and beautiful it suits him I believe. I need much more than that and someone locally I can actually feel in 3D. 

And why did he say he wanted to become my BF though we never met? This is really strange to me. I could may be serious with him if he was a bit more attentive and seriously considering moving here. But he said he doesn’t want to move here the other day while he initially told me he wanted to. He’s just using me for fun right? When I asked him this he said that’s not true. I feel like he’s using me for fun. I am talking to him because he makes me feel very beautiful. But he isn’t it, that much I know… Am I crazy? ",0,1747392886.0,datingoverforty,17,0.17,False
1knxwd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOutdoorsUK/comments/1knxwd8/jetboil_flash_10l_review/,Jetboil Flash 1.0L Review,"For years, the Jetboil Flash has been a ubiquitous sight on trails and campsites, renowned for its blistering speed and convenient all-in-one design. Now, with the release of the updated Jetboil Flash 1.0L, the king of fast boil stoves has received a thoughtful and functional upgrade, further cementing its place as a top choice for outdoor enthusiasts. After putting the new flash 1.0l fast boil system through its paces, it’s clear that Jetboil hasn’t just tweaked a classic; they’ve refined it into an even more intuitive and adventure-ready cooking system. Read on for our full Jetboil Flash 1.0L Review.

  
**Product:** Jetboil Flash 1.0L

**Price:** £149

**Verdict:** 10/10 

**Short Description:** A solid fast boil system for all adventures.

# Pros: A Symphony of Speed and Convenience

* **Unmatched Boil Speed:** Still the undisputed champion when it comes to rapid water boiling.
* **Improved Ignition System:** The new integrated ignition is a game-changer, offering reliable and intuitive operation.
* **Enhanced Stability:** The textured grip and improved locking mechanism provide a more secure cooking experience.
* **Greater Versatility:** The new lid with pour spout and strainer adds practical functionality.
* **Compact and Portable:** The nesting design and lightweight construction make it ideal for backpacking and travel.
* **Easy to Use:** From setup to boiling to packing away, the Flash 1.0L is incredibly user-friendly.
* **Durable and Reliable:** Jetboil’s reputation for quality and longevity continues with this updated model.

# Cons: Minor Considerations

* **Internal Fill Markers:** As with the original, the internal fill markers for safe boiling are significantly lower than the 1-litre capacity to prevent boil-overs. While understandable, this is worth noting if you intend to boil larger quantities at once.
* **Focus on Boiling:** While compatible with accessories, the core design is optimised for boiling water quickly rather than simmering or more complex cooking tasks.

# My Personal Experience: A Decade of Trust, Now Even Better

Having used various Jetboil systems over the years, including the original Flash, I can attest to their enduring quality and convenience. My first experience with the new Flash 1.0L echoed the ease of use I’ve come to expect. Unpacking and setting up took mere seconds – flipping the cap, releasing the gas canister (these are universal but Jetboil sell their own gas brand), burner, and stabilising legs was effortless. The canister screwed in smoothly, and the stabiliser clipped securely to the bottom.

The new integrated ignition system is a genuine improvement. The simple half-turn and immediate spark felt much more natural and reliable than the separate push-button igniter of the previous model. Within what felt like the advertised timeframe, the water was boiling vigorously, ready for my post-walk coffee.

The Nemesis fortress was as busy as a beehive as the personnel hurried to their stations. The divinus's chamber lay shut as the scientists hurriedly exited it around its thick metal doors. Soldiers left the room in droves to join the battle outside, but the lead scientist jumped out of his skin as he saw them.

*""You can't leave us in the middle of an invasion.""* The scientist shouted.

""Be calm, Doctor. The invaders are as good as dead. However, my men and I must handle some weak spots.""

The lead soldier marched off with his men. But as they prepared to leave, the door opened, revealing Daisy, Everton, and Sarah. And Everton was shoving an unconscious Nemesis soldier’s face on the DNA security scanner. Before the soldier could do anything, Everton punched him in the face. As Everton sprinted into the chamber, another soldier drew his Tyloblade, attempting to stab him. However, Everton caught his arm, crushing it. And as the soldier screamed, Everton used him as a living flail, knocking more Nemesis soldiers away. 

As Everton threw the soldier at his comrades, another aimed his plasma gun at him. However, Daisy got in the way with her shield as he fired. The blast bounced off it and struck the soldier’s arm. And Daisy rammed into him with her weapon, knocking him down. Daisy quickly spotted another Nemesis soldier booking towards a big red button, the security alarm, and flung her shield at him. As he was about to press the button, it hit the back of his head, subduing him.

Finally, the remaining Nemesis soldiers in the chamber charged at them. But Sarah grew to her giant size and smashed them into the floor with one punch, dead.

""Good work, girls. Now, we must make haste. We stopped them from calling reinforcements, but they'll learn something is amiss soon.” Everton ran to the metal doors, typing away on the security holophone panel. “Daisy, watch my back. And Gigantes girl, look after the scientists.""

""You got it, and my name is Sarah.""

""Irrelevant.""

Sarah looked at Everton, grinning her teeth, but still carried out his orders. As he worked with the holophone panel, Daisy stood guard over him.

On the battlefield, Gancelot lay on the ground surrounded by his soldiers, clutching his chest in pain as one helped him stand. 

His communicator rang, and he answered it.

""Everton…incredible, but you need five minutes?""

\*\*\*

Four minutes later, the Nemesis scientists cowered in a corner. Daisy, Everton, and Sarah prepared for trouble as they worriedly stared at the barricaded door to the room with their weapons ready, awaiting Nemesis soldiers to burst through.

""God, we're sitting ducks. Everton, can't we pry open the doors to the divinus and have Sarah haul it out of here?""

""I wish. It's bound to its shrine. The two go together or not at all.” Everton took his gaze off the door, looking at Daisy. “All we have to do is stay alive until the security procedure shuts down, and then we can activate the emergency evacuation.""

""Emergency-""

""The entire chamber is prepared for airlift for emergencies like this. When it's time, Fortis and the other pilots will get it and us out of here."" Sarah interrupted.

The doors to the room got blasted open in a flash of light. A sea of Nemesis soldiers flooded in. Among them were ones wearing sinister-looking black armor with numerous jagged edges, cyber troopers. They were cyborg soldiers, Nemesis warriors that had their physical attributes artificially enhanced through technology.

One shot a massive blast at Daisy and the others. They barely dodged it, and Sarah retaliated by swatting him with her giant hand. But he shocked her away with an intense energy field, revealing no damage from her attack. As she got knocked back to regular size.

""E-Everton, what are those metal monsters?"" Daisy asked, trembling.

""Dr. Zola's work.""

A loud alarm went off, and Everton jumped to his feet. *""The security system is down. To the divinus, hurry.""*

Daisy, Everton, and Sarah booked for the divinus. The Nemesis soldiers unloaded a salvo at them. As they ran away, one of the shots hit Sarah in the leg, knocking her down. The soldiers aimed their weapons, preparing to kill her, but Daisy saw this and hurried back. 

Daisy shoved Sarah out of harm's way and readied to die in her place. However, Everton grabbed her, tossing her out of the way. She was helpless to do anything but watch as Everton was shot multiple times to his body before dropping to the ground a limp husk.

*""No,""* Daisy shouted.

The salvo continued unrelenting in the vast number of shots, but with her mind fixated on Everton, Daisy ran over to him with suicidal abandon. However, as Sarah saw Daisy ignoring the plasma bolts flying by her head, she grew to a giant size and ripped out a portion of the floor to block them.

""Oh, gracious Heavenly Father, I beg you, don't take Everton away.""

""D-daisy, you must finish the mission.” Everton pointed his trembling hand to the door. “The emergency evacuation can only work by pressing a large green button on the top of a panel in the chamber.”

""But I can't just-""

Quickly, Daisy saw the Nemesis soldiers break through Sarah’s defense.

""Do as he says, Daisy.” Sarah labored to grasp the soldiers approaching her. “I'll hold them back as long as possible. Just run and don't look back.""

Daisy's face folded intensely as tears flowed from her eyes, but she reluctantly booked for the divinus. She quickly reached the doors, entering its chamber, but one of the armored soldiers flew past Sarah after her. However, brilliant heavenly light burst from it, knocking him away with a powerful shockwave. 

The trooper quickly stood back up. Still, the trooper’s hand was shocked away by an energy field. And even as he shot at it with his guns, they lay without a scratch. Was the Divinus behind this strange development? Could it be that it was never totally a prisoner? Was it waiting for the right time to play its trump card? Still, why now of all times?

\*\*\*

Inside the chamber, Daisy looked at the divinus in amazement. However, she quickly spotted the panel with the green button and ran over, hastily pressing it. 

A minute passed, but nothing happened in the chamber. As Daisy noticed, she frantically pressed the button repeatedly, but nothing happened.

As she looked at the panel, her features hardened. Her heart pounded like a drum, her breathing got heavier, and she punched it in a mad tantrum. But as her knuckles became bloody and bruised, she dropped to the floor crying and curled up in a ball.

""Rise, human child. We have important matters to discuss.""

Daisy jumped to her feet and looked around the room for the source of the voice she heard. However, as she found nobody else in the room, she turned her gaze to the divinus, remembering her conversation with Gancelot.

""D-Divinus, are you talking to me? What do you mean by important matters?""

""I know why you are here. Tell me, human child, why should I give you my power?""

""W-well, because we're here on a quest for justice. We need your power to conquer a monstrous evil.""

""You are not the first to say those words, you know. Countless people before you have demanded my power for weapons and battle strategies to commit murder and called it justice.”

“You have to believe me.”

“Why?”

Daisy got down, bowing to the divinus, touching her forehead on the floor.

""I understand how you feel about violence since I do, too. But I beg you to help the billions suffering under oppression. I will surrender my very life to convince you.""

A deafening silence washed over the chamber for a minute as Daisy made her ply, but the divinus finally answered.

""I have examined your words and heart, human child. And you have spoken no lies. You may have my power with two conditions.""

Daisy jumped to her feet.""Thank you. But what are these conditions?""

""The first is only you will have access to my power. You will become my vessel, an agent of peace and justice. And take on a new name for your rebirth as my proxy. As for the second, you must promise to use my power only for noble ends. Do you agree to these terms?”

Daisy nodded in agreement, and the divinus shot into her body, breaking it apart as she became an amorphous blob of pure light. However, she regained a human form free from all the cuts and bruises her previous self sustained. And armor forged of light surrounded it, a metal dress of blue. As she awakened from her rebirth, Daisy thoroughly scanned her new self at her garments and shield, appearing newly made. 

""I christen you, Damara, Damara the valiant. Now go forth and use my gifts wisely,” Divinus said in a dying whisper.

Daisy looked to the door where Everton and Sarah were tightening her grip on her new shield.

\*\*\*

Outside, Sarah dropped to the ground, bloody and barely clinging to life. Everton was in the same spot, slowly dying. And Nemesis soldiers pointed their guns at them, waiting for the order to kill.

As the armored soldiers tried to enter the divinus's chamber, they were shocked away by an invisible force field.

""Doctor, what is the meaning of this?""

""I-It must be the divinus.""

""Yes, but how? I thought you took measures to ensure this doesn't happen.""

""We did. It seems even after all our research. We don't know the full extent of its power.” The scientist looked towards the soldier in fear. “But don't worry. With the emergency evacuation disabled, there's no escape.""

A Nemesis soldier came to them, pointing to Everton and Sarah. ""Sir, can we please put these animals down now?""

""I will allow them to speak their final words first.""

""We have nothing to say to you people. Get it over with,"" Sarah spat.

The lead soldier gave the signal to kill Everton and Sarah. The Nemesis soldiers prepared to shoot them dead, and Sarah took a deep breath, readying to meet her doom. However, as they were about to pull their triggers, the doors to the divinus burst open with Daisy's giant shield, smashing through them. The soldiers by the doors flew to the other side of the room, crashing down limp. As the remaining soldiers saw Daisy walk out, they turned their guns away from Everton and Sarah, unloading a salvo at her instead. Daisy's shield came in its path, telekinetically directed by her index finger, blocking each strike.

The shots bounced off Daisy's shield, filling the room with dust. However, Daisy shrunk it back to size, guiding it toward its targets. It swiftly hit almost all the Nemesis soldiers, subduing them, and missing the leader. As he saw his comrades defeated, he charged at Daisy, setting up a punch. Still, she effortlessly caught it and punched him in the gut, ending the threat.

Daisy gently placed her adversary on the floor, appearing before the lead scientist in the blink of an eye. ""For the safety of you and your colleagues. Please get back in your corner.""

The scientists in the room followed behind their leader back into the corner. As Daisy saw them, she hurried over to Everton and Sarah.

""Everton, Sarah, thank heaven you're alive.""

""Who are you? How do you know our names?"" Sarah asked.

""You don't recognize me?” 

At that moment, Daisy realized she had a true rebirth. Her face was no longer the same in her current form.

”Listen, I don't have time to explain. But it's me, Daisy.""

""Truthfully?""

Daisy nodded to Sarah's question. 

She tried to pick up Everton, but as she moved him, he screamed in pain.

""I'm such a fool. Everton, I'm so sorry. I should know better than to move you in this state.""

""D-daisy, my time is here. Come close so I may speak my final words.""

""You're delirious from the pain. Sarah, please watch him while I find help.""

Daisy tried to leave them, but Everton grabbed her arm. He refused to let her go, and she stopped trying. She knew Everton wasn’t delirious. Even if she could find a doctor, he likely wouldn’t have time to treat such dire wounds. So, she looked at Everton, crying and a piece of her died inside as she accepted cruel reality.

""Firstly, please tell Orion he was a good friend. It was an honor having him as a commander.”

“Yes, sir,” Daisy said nodding, her voice cracking.

“The next thing is you are like my second daughter, Daisy. I was trying to tell you that on the ship.” 

“Yes, sir. Thank you.” Daisy wiped the tears flowing down her cheeks, now sobbing.

Everton coughed violently and Daisy and Sarah went to help him, but he soon steadied himself.

”Finally, please promise me you will redeem my greatest failure.”

“What?”

“I’ve always regretted Evelyn never getting the chance to grow up. My child, you will pursue your dreams and live a long and happy life, won't you?"" 

Everton initiated a pinky promise, and Daisy accepted it.

*""I was so wrong. You are my Pa.""*

As they finished the pinky promise, Everton's eyes closed, and his breathing stopped. Sarah checked his heartbeat, and her grim face at Daisy confirmed he was dead.

Daisy's screams of agony filled the room as she dropped on his corpse in a crying fit, snot dripping from her nose. But she quickly went silent. Her misery gave way to fiery rage that rivaled the heat of Prometheus, marching out of the room. The young woman experienced an emotion that she thought she would never know. It was an emotion she swore she would never indulge in. Now she couldn’t help but feel it and allow it to guide her. At last, she knew true hate.

Outside, the United Planets soldiers and the Nemesis continued their war. However, all their attention went to the fortress as a massive explosion happened. Daisy stood on top of it, emitting a brilliant light, and it quickly swallowed the battlefield, signaling a victory for the United Planets.

Then I went down the red flag list 1 by 1 creating a supplement plan along the way.

I did this multiple times across multiple GPTS as a stop gap to get the most accurate information.

I then went and spoke to naturopaths at my local health food store confirming my findings and cross referencing the AI's feedback with their personal experience.

So far its been very effective.

These are my red flags -

# 🚩 Red Flags Affecting Energy, Focus, and Productivity

# 1. COMT Met/Met (rs4680 A/A) – Low COMT enzyme activity

* **What it does:** Slower breakdown of dopamine, adrenaline, and norepinephrine.
* **Why it matters:** Can cause **mental fatigue**, overwhelm, **sensitivity to stress**, and difficulty focusing under pressure. Often leads to mental overactivity or racing thoughts, especially in high-stimulus environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Wired-but-tired feeling, overstimulation, anxious procrastination, mental crash after stress.

# 2. MAOA High-Activity (rs6323 G/G) – Faster serotonin & dopamine breakdown

* **What it does:** Reduces levels of calming neurotransmitters like serotonin more quickly.
* **Why it matters:** Can lead to **lower baseline mood**, **less resilience to stress**, and a higher likelihood of fatigue or burnout in high-demand environments.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Flat mood, irritability, low motivation, sensitivity to sleep loss.

# 3. SOD2 Ala/Ala (rs4880 A/A) – Weaker mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme

* **What it does:** Reduces your ability to clear mitochondrial oxidative stress.
* **Why it matters:** Leads to **less efficient cellular energy production**, and **faster mitochondrial fatigue**, especially under stress, high training loads, or poor sleep.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Physical tiredness, sluggishness, headaches, or fatigue that hits earlier in the day than it should.

# 4. GSTM1 Null (gene deleted) – Reduced detox capacity

* **What it does:** Limits your ability to detox free radicals and chemical byproducts.
* **Why it matters:** If exposed to toxins, pollution, poor diet, or stress, you’ll accumulate oxidative stress **faster**, which wears down energy and mental clarity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Brain fog, slower recovery, fatigue after alcohol or junk food, sluggish mornings.

# 5. MTHFR A1298C Homozygous (rs1801131 G/G) – Mild methylation bottleneck

* **What it does:** Slightly reduces conversion of folate to its active form.
* **Why it matters:** May cause **lower neurotransmitter and energy molecule production**, especially if B2, B6, folate, or B12 are suboptimal.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Low mental energy, slow mental start in the morning, difficulty focusing, more tired on low-carb or low-protein diets.

# 6. FMO3 Variants + BHMT Heterozygous – Choline and methylation backup pathway compromise

* **What it does:** Reduces efficiency of homocysteine recycling and choline metabolism.
* **Why it matters:** Choline is needed for acetylcholine (key for focus), methylation (energy + detox), and liver function. Low choline = low productivity.
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Afternoon slumps, foggy thinking, or mental fatigue with low-protein intake or skipping eggs/meat.

# 7. DAO Variants (rs10156191 + rs2052129) – Histamine intolerance

* **What it does:** Slows breakdown of dietary histamine.
* **Why it matters:** **High histamine = brain fog, anxiety, disrupted sleep**, and even energy crashes after eating high-histamine foods (wine, cheese, aged meat, leftovers).
* **Symptoms you might notice:** Energy swings, headaches, irritability after meals, trouble winding down at night.

Supplements I have started taking and will be adding to my existing stack:

# ✅ Suggested Integration Plan (No Overlap, Best Timing)

# 🚀 Morning (Fasting window) — Focus + Dopamine Priming

Take with water or light liquid:

* NAC
* L-Tyrosine
* Alpha-GPC
* TMG
* ALCAR
* Mega Magnesium
* Cordyceps
* B-complex
* Zinc
* Alpha Lipoic
* CoQ10
* Fusion Memory
* Stress Ease
* Theanine

✅ *Optional: add 5–10g sunflower lecithin in liquid (coffee or shake) for early choline support*

# 🍽 12:30 PM (Meal 1 – Break Fast) — Dopamine Receptor Growth

Take with food + fats:

* Uridine Monophosphate (300mg)
* Fish Oil (for DHA synergy)
* Sunflower Lecithin (add remainder to meal/smoothie)
* Primal Multi
* Primal Body
* Liver Care
* Methyl B12 + L-Methylfolate
* DIM + I3C with PQQ

# 🌙 Night (Before Bed) — Recovery + Neurobalance

* Switch Nutrition Sleep
* Body Ripped GABA
* Optional: L-Theanine (if needed)

# 🔄 Optional Cycling Notes

* **L-Tyrosine** – can be skipped 1–2x per week to avoid overstimulation (especially COMT Met/Met)
* **Uridine Monophosphate** – cycle 5 days on / 2 off or 4 weeks on / 1 off
* **Alpha-GPC** – consider cycling opposite uridine if you want to test sensitivity changes
* **DIM** – monitor over time; may not need to take continuously

I am still in the process of ordering and being shipped a few supps.

A major AHA moment came today with this little gem:

DRD2 A1 allele (reduced dopamine receptor density) Your reward system might not feel the “hit” from slow progress — you need stronger stimuli or more novelty to stay engaged. This makes you crave the start of something new, but disengage when the grind starts. So I should take this?

Uridine Monophosphate (150–300mg) → Supports dopamine receptor density (especially helpful with your DRD2 A1) → Great for long-term mood and drive stability

I am getting Uridine next week and combined with choline and fish oil and I cant wait to see what happens.

\------------------------------------------------

This week though ive added in Herbs of gold Stress Ease and Liver Care, COq10 and NAC.

And I've felt the best i have in years. I think a lot of my trouble was clearing away the toxins and also supporting my slow COMT gene with adaptogens like rhodiola and Ashwaghanda (which is in Stress Ease)

I am more focus, clear headed, less time chronically tired and overall feel much lighter already and I have only just started.

**TL;DR** 

Using my DNA, Genetic health reports and LLMS I built a personalized supplement stack and I am already seeing fantastic results within the first week of trying it. This all up cost me about $150 USD to get my testing, reports, and results analysis",2,1747392679.0,NooTopics,0,0.67,False

Normally when you make coffee you don't want it to be bitter and choose the temperature, pressure, particle size accordingly. But if you wouldn't have to worry about bitterness, and want to focus on the other flavor components, how would you go about it? How would a barista make him an espresso? It's only a minor plot point but I'd love to have them go to a coffee shop and let the barista make some nerdy coffee talk that actually makes sense.

Edited to add: I'm really interested in the details. Like what kind of coffee would be chosen, species/country/region, what kind of roast (dark?), and also the settings for the machine.

1knxr7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/warno/comments/1knxr7w/sead_rework_also_west_german_technology_leader/,SEAD REWORK!!!! ALSO West german technology leader - Part 3?! - Tornado ECR - NEW KING OF SEAD,"



https://preview.redd.it/uj16r3fpi41f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=191fbb496b349a203b4b4f15d1f7ae044c4fa808

**TL;DR**

* **Tornado ECR** – only Cold-War jet that can yeet **all four** HARMs in one ripple, instant aim-time, still rocks a 0.1-40 GHz jammer.
* **F-4G Wild Weasel V** – the OG; fires a **pair** of HARMs at once, still a legend.
* **EA-6B Prowler** – twin-shot plus the loudest jammer on the planet, but sloooow to cue.
* **EF-111A Raven** – can’t kill SAMs, but turns the whole map into white noise (60 ECM).
* **Everything else** (MiG-25BM, F-16C HTS, Su-24MP, Su-27, RAF GR.1) = single-shot peasants with bargain-bin pods.

 

 The technological wonder the **Tornado ECR, 1990: the SEAD Apex Predator**

·**Plug-&-kill sensors** – Honeywell ELS auto-spits a GPS fix straight into the HARM rails; no typing, no waiting.

·**50-radar brain + dedicated EWO** – tracks an entire Soviet brigade’s SAM nets at once while the pilot hugs treetops at Mach 0.9.

·**Four-round “mag-dump”** – only jet that can volley **all four** HARMs in the same heartbeat; F-4G/Prowler manage two, everyone else fires singles.

·**True stealth-by-terrain** – built-in terrain-following radar lets it pop up, shoot, disappear before the threat can swivel.

·**0 s draw time** – sub-15 s real kill-chain vs. 60–90 s for pod jockeys.

·**Wide-spectrum jammer** – Cerberus covers **0.1–40 GHz**; Soviet pods stop at 18 GHz and push 1 kW on a good day.

Result: in 1990 the ECR could obliterate a Warsaw-Pact SAM belt faster than the operators could shout *“Raketnyy!”*—while every other aircraft was still scrolling menus or waiting for its pod to triangulate.

But we are a few month ootf.. but if WARNO is happy to field the British Tornado GR with its parachute-ALARM gimmick and the late-arrival F-16C HTS, there’s zero excuse to leave out the Luftwaffe’s Tornado ECR - It hit IOC in May 1990 – inside the game’s timeframe. So If the GR’s polite single-fire and the F-16’s 1.5-second twiddle time are “good enough” for the game, then the Tornado ECR – the actual SEAD apex predator of 1990 – has to march to war alongside them, or the Bundeswehr goes to battle without the best kit it really had.

 **How the new SEAD Ripple volley rule works**

1. **Need an EWO seat** – no back-seater, no multi-shot.
2. **How many missiles?**
   * ECR: 4 (pilot + EWO + 50-radar DRFM)
   * F-4G & Prowler: 2 (pilot + EWO/ECMO, smaller memory)
   * Everyone else: 1

 

https://preview.redd.it/1xvy0u5uh41f1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4a2f5faaa958ecfdd0a8d76341f6848ab86f2ac

 The ECM score — spelled out

**ECM (0 – 60)**

1.     **Index** = 0.50 × (Peak EIRP / 10 kW) + 0.30 × (Bandwidth / 40 GHz) + 0.20 × (Emitters / 50)

2.     **ECM** = Index ÷ 0.746 × 60 (ALQ-99’s index ≈ 0.746 → hard-capped 60)

So.. to shorten it...

·**Tornado ECR** – Push-button death. ELS locks fifty emitters, pipes the grid to all four HARMs *automatically*, while the EWO sips coffee and presses *“Rip all”*. Result: four missiles gone before the ""2K12"" crew can say *“Что?!”*.

·**F-4G** – Same magic trick, but its 1970s sensor memory only holds one “bucket” of 12-ish radars. Still terrifying. the grandfather of SEAD: fires its doctrinal **pair-salvo**, laughs while your Kub battery burns.

·**Prowler** – Has auto-handoff *and* three ECMOs, but its ALQ-99 has to pause jamming to feed the HARM cue, so USN limited it to two-missile ripples. Big boom, bigger lag.

·**Raven** – No missiles, all megawatts. Turns the ether into dial-up static; everyone hides behind it. **60 ECM** and a moving blind spot the size of Bavaria.

·**Everyone else** – No EWO or no auto-handoff means the pilot/WSO is fat-fingering target numbers while getting painted by an SA-11/*MIM-23*. They fire one missile, then start typing again. Soviet “wonder pods” peak at 20 ecm because their pods barely push 1 kW. Cope harder, comrades.

 

  Why this would rock for WARNO and especially GERMAN GUYS...

·**Clear tiers:** 4/2/1 missile ripples are obvious at a glance.

·**Historical & balanced:** honours real crew stations and sensor gear

·**Soviets stop role-playing as ALQ-99 owners:** their ECM finally matches their „1 kW“ analog export-brochure pods. Soviets didnt even have a dedicated SEAD Plane and got right now the best SEAD Planes in the game... absurd! While US was inventor of SEAD and Germany mastered it in 1990!

So yeah—give Germany its Tornado ECR, let the Raven drown the airwaves, keep the Wild Weasel dangerous, and watch every single-seat Soviet “SEAD” bird get sent home crying after its one lonely missile. i will get buckets for the pactoids tears!

The tagline of Kylea G Weight loss Journey is, ""I changed my life with prayer and a playlist of songs.  No surgery, no meds.  Just Jesus.""

DAILY STATS 05/15/24:

0/10 posts discussed prayer 

0/10 discussed music

2/10 discussed extra walking from sightseeing

0/10 shared a recipe

5/10 were about something Kylea ate or drank

1/10 was about 2 bandanas for Birdie

1/10 was about the weather

1/10 ""Joe"" posted about Arby's Kylea had delivered to the apartment

📢 For our friends at Meta, that means 30% of her monetized content had nothing to do with weight loss, which is the tagline and purpose of her page.

⚠️ Disordered Eating- Daily WW Points Used (Data compiled from monetized content):

1-2 WW Points?: Warm latte with almond milk, sugar-free vanilla, and monkfruit. 🚨 No sugar-free options are available at the Parakeet Cafe.  Per their website, only house-made organic vanilla syrup is available.  Kylea did not list the WW points for this beverage.  🤔 

0 WW Points: FOUR scrambled eggs, fresh berries, and water 

0 WW Points: Fresh Pressed Juice 🚨 Kylea does not count points for this, but the WW website counts blended and pressed juices as points.

0 WW Points: Southwest salad with chicken, corn, blackbeans, and salsa

7 WW Points: Poppi Root Beer, fresh pineapple, and a Quest Coconutty Caramel Bar with Almonds

📢 For our friends at Meta, that means Kylea consumed 8-9 out of (up to) 30 daily WW points in maintenance mode= Disordered Eating.  This is dangerous messaging for her 140k+ followers on a weight loss journey.  Please follow your policies on eating disorders and take action.

Recipes Shared: ZERO

🚨 Please speak with a medical professional about any questions or concerns you have about your health.

Comments: Kylea stopped showing the food and beverages her sister consumed today.  Her sister is physically active and appears to practice moderation in eating with a more diverse palate.  I think Kylea did not appreciate the praise her sister was receiving, and it made Kylea's Disordered Eating more apparent to followers.

Most posts were edited 3+ times (a few rapidfire edits then multiple hours later).

1. ""Starting our day with a 30 minute walk to breakfast.👟 We wanted to explore as much as possible with our own two feet and that's exactly what we are doing!!  The girl that showed up on July 5th of 2021 is so proud! 💖""

⏸️ People who have walked daily to a playlist for almost 3 years should not make a BIG deal about walking 30 minutes.  

2. Kylea spent approx. $34 on 2 more bandanas for Birdie at the Farmers Market.  

3. Parakeet Cafe: Kylea was charmed by this cafe and said, ""I sat here enjoying my coffee and thinking of my grams.  All the birds remind me of her 💖 ☕️"" 

⏸️ May Grams RIP. 🙏 To her family and friends, I am sorry that Kylea repeatedly monetizes her death.  

4. Morning Glory for Breakfast: A large bowl of 4 scrambled eggs and berries are shown.  

⏸️ This was not a choice on the online menu.  To fear food in a wonderful culinary destination, like San Diego, is sad.  Kylea needs medical care.  ☮️ 

5. San Diego Zoo: ""I've done a lot of walking here so I'm so thankful for my improved health.  God is so good! 💖"" 

⏸️ Kylea does not look well in the picture.  I feel her body is not used to this level of outside activity.  

6. Fresh Pressed Juice: Kylea posts a green fresh  pressed juice from the Farmers Market.  The Reddit theory is that this stop occurred before breakfast, and she waited to post it since she had just consumed a latte.

7. ""Joe"" posted about Arby's: ""My wife is the best!  She sent me one of my favorite meals for dinner tonight and enough for me to have for lunch tomorrow.  I love the roast beef sandwich from Arby's! ❤️""

⏸️ Please see the link above on power and control in domestic violence. Why was Joe unable to purchase Arby's on his own?  Why was it delivered?  Why the goofy picture of him holding the food bag?  Although I realize ""his"" posts boost ""her"" engagement, fast food is triggering for those on a weight loss journey.  Meta, please take action.

8. Southwest Salad: Kylea dined at an unnamed restaurant.  ""I tend to eat chicken, eggs, veggies, and fruit while on vacay because it is what I like the most! 💖""

⏸️ Kylea needs help for her Disordered Eating.

9. Post-Dinner Snacks: ""Having some snacks after a long day of a lot of walking! 👟 I've never tried the poppi before or the quest candy bar and they are both SO good!!  I got 12 grams of protein in while eating that quest candy bar and it was amazing!!!""

⏸️ That's right...her only WW points from food was a ""candy bar"" today, and it was ""SO good"" and ""amazing!!!""  This is gaslighting.  Food is fuel.  Green beans and brownies are the same... The iced cookie cake was ""fine,"" remember? 🤔 

10. She's cold: This travel blogger must not have checked the weather for her backpack trip. ""I packed a sweatshirt just in case and it turns out I'm probably going to be wearing it the entire time because I'm so cold.""

In the world of premium culinary ingredients, [organic Madagascar vanilla](https://robustmadagascar.com/products/vanilla/) holds an elite status. Known for its rich aroma, creamy texture, and complex flavor profile, it is widely considered the finest vanilla in the world. Unlike synthetic or non-organic alternatives, this type of vanilla is grown in the fertile soils of Madagascar using natural farming methods that protect both the environment and the final product’s purity.

Robust Madagascar, a trusted name in the vanilla trade, has been at the forefront of cultivating, processing, and exporting the highest quality organic Madagascar vanilla. With a commitment to sustainable farming and fair trade practices, the company not only delivers authentic products but also supports local communities and the environment.

In this blog, we explore why organic Madagascar vanilla stands out, its journey from farm to kitchen, the benefits it offers, and how Robust Madagascar is leading this flavorful revolution.

**1. The Origin and Uniqueness of Madagascar Vanilla**

Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, is located off the southeastern coast of Africa. The country’s tropical climate, rich volcanic soil, and distinct weather patterns make it an ideal location for growing vanilla beans. Specifically, the Sava region of Madagascar is globally recognized for producing over 80% of the world’s vanilla.

The vanilla plant itself is a species of orchid. It is pollinated by hand, a process that requires significant skill, patience, and time. After pollination, the pods take about nine months to mature, followed by an elaborate curing process that lasts several more months. It is during this process that the beans develop their characteristic dark brown color and intoxicating fragrance.

Organic Madagascar vanilla differs from conventional vanilla not only in farming techniques but also in quality and sustainability. No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or artificial agents are used at any stage of cultivation or processing. This ensures that the vanilla remains pure, potent, and safe for consumption.

**2. Why Organic Farming Matters in Vanilla Cultivation**

The benefits of organic farming go far beyond just health and safety. When it comes to a delicate crop like vanilla, organic cultivation helps enhance the natural compounds that give the vanilla its world-renowned taste and aroma.

Organic Madagascar vanilla is grown in a natural environment where the soil is enriched with compost and plant-based fertilizers. This not only boosts the nutrient value of the vanilla but also preserves biodiversity and promotes soil fertility.

By avoiding synthetic inputs, organic farming reduces the environmental footprint of vanilla cultivation. Moreover, it helps protect the health of farmers, many of whom work closely with the plants during pollination and harvesting. At Robust Madagascar, organic farming is a core principle. The company collaborates with hundreds of local farmers, providing training, resources, and certification assistance to ensure that each vanilla bean meets global organic standards.

**3. Processing and Quality Control: From Pod to Perfection**

After harvest, the vanilla beans undergo a time-intensive curing process that includes blanching, sweating, sun-drying, and conditioning. This process can last up to six months and is crucial for developing the signature qualities of organic Madagascar vanilla.

Each step must be handled with care to preserve the beans’ integrity. Any deviation in temperature, moisture, or timing can alter the final product’s quality. This is why expertise and experience are so important in vanilla processing.

Robust Madagascar operates modern processing facilities where traditional methods meet advanced quality control systems. The beans are sorted by hand, graded, and packed in hygienic environments to ensure they reach international clients in peak condition.

The result is a product that offers a deep, rich, and creamy flavor with sweet, floral, and earthy notes—ideal for baking, brewing, perfumery, and cosmetics.

**4. Culinary and Commercial Applications of Madagascar Vanilla**

The demand for organic Madagascar vanilla spans across several industries. From gourmet kitchens to multinational food brands, vanilla is a staple ingredient. Here’s how it is commonly used:

**1. Baking and Confectionery:**  
In cakes, cookies, custards, and ice creams, organic Madagascar vanilla enhances sweetness and adds complexity to flavor profiles.

**2. Beverage Industry:**  
Vanilla is widely used in coffee, teas, and alcoholic beverages. Its smooth and creamy taste complements both hot and cold drinks.

**3. Cosmetics and Perfumery:**  
Due to its natural fragrance, vanilla is used in perfumes, lotions, and body care products. Organic options like those from Robust Madagascar are especially valued for their purity.

**4. Health and Wellness:**  
Vanilla contains antioxidants and has mood-boosting properties, making it a favored ingredient in natural wellness products.

Whether it’s a Michelin-starred restaurant or a homemade batch of cookies, organic Madagascar vanilla lends a premium touch to any recipe.

**5. Sustainability, Traceability, and Ethical Sourcing**

One of the biggest challenges in the vanilla industry is sustainability. Price volatility, deforestation, and unethical labor practices have raised concerns in recent years. However, companies like Robust Madagascar are working to change that narrative.

Through direct partnerships with farmers, Robust Madagascar ensures ethical sourcing and fair trade. Farmers receive fair compensation, training, and support, enabling them to reinvest in their land and communities.

The company also maintains complete traceability for every batch of vanilla. This means customers can track the journey of the vanilla beans—from the farm to the final packaging. Such transparency builds trust and allows clients to verify the quality and origin of what they are buying.

In addition to social responsibility, Robust Madagascar adopts eco-friendly practices such as biodegradable packaging, water conservation systems, and organic waste recycling. These efforts contribute to the overall sustainability of the vanilla supply chain.

**6. Choosing the Right Vanilla: Tips for Buyers and Importers**

For buyers, especially importers, chefs, and formulators, choosing the right vanilla product can be challenging. With the growing market for organic products, not all “organic” vanilla is equal.

Here are a few tips to help ensure you’re buying true organic Madagascar vanilla:

**1. Check for Certifications:**  
Ensure the product is certified organic by recognized bodies like USDA Organic, EU Organic, or Ecocert.

**2. Evaluate the Aroma and Appearance:**  
True Madagascar vanilla has a strong, sweet aroma with slightly oily, pliable pods that are deep brown in color.

**3. Look for Traceability:**  
Reputable suppliers like Robust Madagascar provide tracking information, allowing buyers to know exactly where and how the vanilla was produced.

**4. Ask About Farming Practices:**  
Understanding how the vanilla is grown and processed can help verify its organic authenticity.

**5. Review Packaging and Shelf Life:**  
Quality vanilla should be vacuum-packed or stored in airtight containers to retain its moisture and flavor.

Robust Madagascar meets all these standards and more, offering a consistent, high-grade product that is ideal for professional and personal use alike.

**7. The Economic Impact of Organic Vanilla on Madagascar**

The vanilla industry plays a significant role in Madagascar’s economy, employing over 200,000 people. For many rural families, it is their primary source of income. However, the shift to organic farming has brought even greater economic benefits.

Organic vanilla commands higher market prices, which in turn provides better incomes for farmers. It also reduces dependence on expensive chemical inputs and promotes long-term soil fertility, making farming more sustainable.

Robust Madagascar's community-driven model has helped transform entire villages by creating stable jobs, building local infrastructure, and funding education and healthcare initiatives.

This holistic approach ensures that every purchase of organic Madagascar vanilla supports not just a business but a community and a way of life.

**8. Conclusion: The Future of Flavor is Organic**

Organic Madagascar vanilla is more than just an ingredient—it’s a legacy of excellence, purity, and sustainability. Its journey from the hands of dedicated farmers in Madagascar to kitchens and labs around the world is a testament to the power of ethical business and quality craftsmanship.

**10. The Global Rise of Organic Vanilla Products**

Consumer awareness of food origin and quality has seen a dramatic rise over the past decade. From chefs to health-conscious families, there is growing demand for natural and organic ingredients. Vanilla, once considered a luxury item, is now a staple in many homes and food brands—but only when sourced responsibly.

Market studies show a significant increase in the global demand for organic Madagascar vanilla, especially in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. This demand has encouraged producers and exporters to adopt better farming practices, improve post-harvest techniques, and embrace certifications that validate organic status.

Companies like Robust Madagascar are well-positioned to serve this market by offering scalable supply without compromising on quality or ethics. Their ability to manage end-to-end production—from farmer training to international logistics—makes them a reliable partner for businesses across industries.

This shift towards organic is not just a trend; it’s the future of how food, cosmetics, and wellness products will be produced and consumed.

**11. Preserving a Cultural and Environmental Treasure**

The story of organic Madagascar vanilla is as much about people and the environment as it is about flavor. Vanilla cultivation in Madagascar is a centuries-old tradition, deeply woven into the cultural and economic fabric of the nation.

By encouraging organic farming methods and fair trade, companies like Robust Madagascar help preserve this tradition while addressing modern challenges such as deforestation, climate change, and labor exploitation.

Farmers are trained not only in agricultural techniques but also in environmental stewardship. Many are now planting shade trees, using composting systems, and participating in reforestation projects—actions that will benefit the land for generations to come.

The preservation of Madagascar’s delicate ecosystems is critical, not just for vanilla cultivation, but for global biodiversity. Supporting organic vanilla production is one way consumers and businesses can make a meaningful difference.

Lexie

At first glance, you would think I’m just an average nineteen-year-old girl. There is nothing about me that stands out if you aren’t looking. I work in a family-run diner in Gwinn, Michigan. I go to the university here to study Zoology. I live by myself in a small two-story house at the edge of town. See plain and simple and until recently I would have completely agreed with you. My name is Alexandria, Lexie for short. And this is the story of where my life changes into a magical story you only see in movies or books.

It started on the first day of the snow season and the ground was already coated in a foot of fluffy white stuff and was steadily coming down. “ So this is light snow flurries,” I say to myself shaking my head. I pull my coat closer around me and get in my midnight blue nineteen ninety eight Chevy silverado.Don’t laugh, my dad bought it cheap for me when I got my license. We fixed up together to get it running like a dream. I toss my backpack in the passenger seat and start the truck hoping it will heat up quickly.

My work uniform was not designed for warmth. It is a red and white striped dress that goes to my knees. And flares at my waist showing off my hips and ass. A top that unfortunately shows too much cleavage for my taste. Add red pantyhose and white shoes and the outfit is complete. Add to the look my scarlet red hair pulled up in a ponytail and a white scarf. Honestly, I look like a five-foot-seven-inch candy cane and a fifties car hop merged. Yes, I’m tall but I have an abundance of curves that my uniform does nothing to hide. I have an hourglass figure that I’m damn proud of but the outfit shows off a bit much of it.

I think my boss has a thing for the fifties because the diner is the same way but hey it is a job. A job that pays the bills and works around my school schedule. Plus the people I work with are great and the customers are always nice and tip pretty well. I pull into the small parking lot across the street from the diner. Figures just as I started to warm up I have to get back out in the snow again. I grab my backpack, shove my keys in the pocket of my jacket and lock up. I walk as quickly as I can, without slipping and falling on my ass, to the diner.

The diner itself is a cute little L shaped place. Bright red booths line the outside walls and the front windows. Silver two-person tables with red Formica tops and silver chairs with red cushions are set in the middle between the booths and the counter. The counter takes up the rest of the front of the diner. The kitchen is behind the counter with a large rectangular window where we receive orders.Down the hall are bathrooms, locker room, as well as the office. The floor makes it all stand out with black and white checkered tiles. It has a fifties feel to it when you see the vintage records and old posters hanging on the walls.

“Hey, kiddo,” Patsy greets me with a warm smile from where she stands behind the counter. Patsy is a sweet lady in her mid-sixties I think, not that I would ever ask. She is a petite woman about five foot three inches with light brown hair that she always keeps in a tight bun. One of the best things about Patsy is no matter what time of day it is she is always in a good mood. I do enjoy working with her. “ How are you enjoying the first snow?” Patsy asks.

Shaking the snow from my hair and jacket I answer “ I don’t know if I will ever get used to it. I’m freezing. I have never been in snow before. I don’t know how to handle it. I’m from Florida for crying out loud.” Patsy just smiles. “ Don’t worry. I know you will be just fine. Just remember what I told you about layering up. Now get your butt over here and help me.” I put my backpack in the backroom and headed back to help Patsy.

“ Where do you want me to start?” I ask while Patsy puts on a fresh pot of coffee. “ Here, sip this while you get the silverware ready. She says when she hands me a cup of hot tea with honey. “ It should help warm you up.” she continues. I sit at the very end of the counter wrapping spoons, forks and knives together as I sip my tea. Patsy was right, it is warming me up. She grabs the salt shakers to refill them and sits next to me. The diner is empty so now is perfect for what Patsy calls girl time. Which is just her way of checking on me. She has been doing it since I moved here.

“ How’s school going? How do you like your classes?” she asks. “ It is going well. The professors are ok. The homework is a bit more than I expected so I have to study every chance I get to keep my grades up.” I say. “ Lexi, honey you can’t live your life in books. I know this is important to you but what about friends? Have you made any yet? I know you haven’t gone to any parties or on any dates.” I almost spit out the tea I just took a sip of and start coughing. I have to catch my breath to answer “ Patsy, I’m fine. I have been asked to join a few study groups. Parties aren’t my thing. And as for dates, I don’t have time. I am happy spending time with you and my books.” I told her.

For the most part, it is except for the dating part. I don’t date. I never have. I have been asked out a few times over the years and even a few times since I moved here but I always declined. Don’t get me wrong I want to date. But for some reason, my gut told me not to go. I have to wait. For what I don’t know. I have always trusted my instincts so I’m waiting. My mom used to call it my inner voice and I should pay attention. And I always have.

“ Oh, Lexi” Patsy starts as an elderly couple comes in and sits in her section. “ back to work but this conversation isn’t over,” she says and goes to greet her customers. When it comes to me I swear Patsy is like a dog with a bone. So I know she won’t let this go even though I wish she would. A steady stream of customers comes in, keeping us busy for a while. I for one am grateful for it. It makes the shift go by faster and I can avoid Patsy’s questions. I know her heart is in the right place but I don’t feel like discussing my love life especially for something I don’t understand myself. It isn’t as if I don’t want someone but I’m holding on to what my gut says. I feel it will be worth it in the end.

As quickly as everyone came in I swear they all left at the same time. Now it is just Patsy me and our cook. Patsy and I are clearing tables and cleaning up. “ Help me finish up and then you can take the back booth to study for a while,” Patsy says. I’m about to argue with her but before I can get my mouth open she continues “ If we get busy I’ll come to get you. The snow is coming down pretty good so I don’t think that we will get many people in if any at all.” I agree with her “ Ok, but I will lock up and you go home early for a change.” Patsy smiles big “ Kiddo, you have got yourself a deal.”

Patsy was right, we stayed empty while we finished our clean-up. I grabbed my backpack and went to the very last booth in the back so I would be out of the way in case any customers came in. I have my books spread out all over the table with my notebooks in front of me. I was so involved in my work I didn’t notice Patsy had brought me another cup of tea until she tapped me on the shoulder. “ Hey, drink up,” she says. “ How’s the homework going?” she asked. “ Not bad. I think I’m almost finished. And the best part is I think I understand most of it..” Patsy laughs “ I’m sure you understand more than you think. I know how smart you are even if you don’t. I know you graduated high school with honors.” “ High school was easy. This stuff, not so much.” I say. Patsy just squeezes me in support. “ I’ll leave you to it.” and she goes back to the counter to read her book. I envy her sometimes. I can’t remember the last time I read for fun.

# Chapter 2

Lexie

By the time I am finished, it looks like a ghost town outside so I didn’t have to worry about customers. I had just put my backpack away when a group of four came in. Three guys and one girl. They are regulars but always sit in Patsy’s section so I have never interacted with them. Patsy called out to them “ Go ahead and grab a seat anywhere Aden.” She turns to me and says “ Why don’t you take them? My feet are killing me and I want to sit a bit longer.” I look at her puzzled “ They are in your section. They always sit in your section. I can’t take your customers.” Pasty grabs my hand and we go over to the group.

“Hello,” she says “Would it be alright if Lexi here waits on you tonight?” The girl in the group lowers her eyes as if she disapproves but one of the guys spoke up “ Sure Patsy, that is fine with us.” As he looks me up and down with interest in his eyes. Patsy walks away but I didn’t miss the mischievous look in her eyes. I get the feeling I’m being set up. I turn my attention to the group. “ So what can I get you?” I ask as I take my pad and pen out of my apron. I feel all their eyes on me three with interest or at least curiosity. But the girl looked at me in what I think may be disgust. I don’t know what her problem is but I ignore it and do my job. “ Just coffee.” the girl snaps. I’m getting odd vibes from this group and I can’t fully place it. The girl is giving me the creeps and I feel the need to get away from her fast. But one of the guys is giving off a calming vibe but with them so close together I can’t tell who it is. So I am getting confused.

“ Sure. Anything else?” I ask, trying to keep my calm and my voice steady. My body is sending all kinds of signals. I can’t weed them out and I don’t like it. “ No, just coffee. And make it quick.” The girl snaps again. What is her problem? I know I have never done anything to her since this is the first time I have ever talked to them. “ Miss, I’ll have a slice of apple pie as well please.” the guy to the right of me asks. Relieved to be able to get away from them I smile at him.” Sure. I’ll get your order right away.” and quickly walk to the counter trying to shake off this weird feeling.

Aiden

When the waitress walks away I look at Melissa to figure out what her problem is. She never snaps at anyone. “ What the hell, Melissa?” I whisper. I know she can hear me. You see not a lot of people know this but we are wolves. I mean we can turn into wolves. We have a few names werewolves and shapeshifters are the most common but I prefer shifters. But I’ll explain more later. I want to know what Melissa’s problem is. She looks at me with confusion in her eyes. “ I don’t know. I didn’t mean to snap. But there is something off about her.” Melissa shakes her head like she is getting her thoughts together. “ No, not off. Different. I sense something in her but I don’t know what. My wolf Amber feels like she has to protect her but my human says push her away. I didn’t know what to do so I snapped.”

I felt something too but like Melissa said I don’t know what. I looked at Jesse and Jackson to see if they felt anything. “ I felt something too. Remus says to keep her close. So I listen to him.” Jesse says. We all learned in the past to trust his wolf, Remus. It is like he has a super sense about these things. Jackson adds “ I could feel something but like Melissa said I don’t know what. It was almost as if I could feel some wolf in her. Some traits at least. Trip says he feels like she is important but doesn’t know in what way. But he agrees with Remus and Amber that we have to keep her safe.”

I lean back and have a chat with my wolf who has been trying to get my attention ever since Lexie came to the table. “ Razor, what do you think?” I ask. “ There is something about her. I can sense wolf but not much. For now, she is mostly human.” he says. “ What do you mean for now?” “ I’m not sure. But I feel we need to keep her close and safe. She is very important and I feel she probably doesn’t know it. I feel the Goddess at work here. And I feel she is important to you and me.” “ Ok Razor.” I agree. Razor has a good sense when the Goddess is involved even though he hasn’t felt anything in years.

I look at the others “ We need to talk to the elders but we also need to find out more about her. All of our wolves agree she is important. We need to listen to them. Razor says the Goddess is involved but he doesn’t have the answers yet. He says Lexie may not know what it is or what she is. So we can’t say anything until we know more.” When we are all agreed I go to the counter to try and talk to Lexie or get a better feel for her at least.

When I get to the counter Lexie has her back to me. “ Excuse me, miss.” She turns around and smiles. A smile that makes me feel like all is right with the world. Her presence is calming even though I wasn’t stressed. “ Yes. Was there something else I could get for you?” Lexi asked. How did I not notice that her voice sounded like music to my ears? Almost like angels singing with a hint of a southern accent to it. I took a minute to get a good look at her. I looked her over from head to toe. Not one inch of her escaped my eyes. Damn, she had a body on her. Tits I swear are at least 36 double c’s and would love to bury my face between. Nice wide hips that were made for holding and I could see my hands on. You could see she had a bit of a tummy but not huge and not tight either. And her ass well, shit it was perfect globes that were more than a handful just the way I like it. Lexie is without a doubt the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes on with a perfect curvy body.

I looked back at her face and was caught in her eyes. They are bright aquamarine green, an unusual color, yes but that isn’t the only thing that gets your attention. It was the fact I truly believe they were glowing. I realized I was staring too long when Lexie started to twitch like she was uncomfortable. “ Sorry. No, we don’t need anything. I just wanted to apologize for the way my sister acted. She doesn’t mean to be harsh, it just comes across that way sometimes.” Lexi nods “ It is ok. Really. You don’t need to apologize. She is used to Patsy.” “ There is still no excuse to be rude,” I tell her. She is pouring coffee. “ If you want to go sit back down I’ll bring you coffee over to you.” I feel like I’m being dismissed but I don’t want to leave her yet. I feel like I can’t. Even Razor is telling me to keep her talking. To stay close to her. The guy is jumping around in my head like a damn puppy.

“ Razor, what is your problem?” I ask. “ I need to be closer. I need to touch her,” he growls. “ You need to calm down or you will scare her,” I tell him. He huffs and goes to the back of my mind. “ Are you ok?” I hear Lexie ask, pulling my attention. I clear my throat “ Yes, I’m good. Why do you ask?” Lexie shakes her head “ Nothing it is just your eyes changed color for a minute that’s all.” Shit, I didn’t mean for her to see that. “ I’m sorry if I scared you. I was just thinking about something.” Lexie laughs “ You looked pretty deep in thought. But I wasn’t scared. My eyes do that all the time” That’s interesting. The only people I know whose eyes change are wolves.

“ They do?” I asked, needing to know more. Lexie grabs Jesse’s pie and places it on the counter getting ready to take everything to our table. “ Yea, it freaked me out the first time it happened but over the years I got used to it. My grandma called them mood eyes.” Lexi shakes her head “ And you didn’t want to know all that. Sorry.” Actually, I do want to know but I don’t tell her that. “ I’m headed back to your table if you want to go back to your friends.” I nod and turn around. But turn back to her and hold out my hand “ I’m Aiden.” “ Lexie as you know. It is nice to meet you.” When she grabs my hand to shake it I feel like I have been struck by lightning. It runs up my arm and completely through my body. Razor shouts “ Mate. Mate.” over and over again. He won’t stop. That’s when the smell hits me. Oranges and the ocean. It is coming from Lexie. How did I not notice it before? “ Get mate. Need mate.” Razor is all but screaming at me.

No. No. This can’t be happening. I waited two years to find my mate for this. Most wolves find their mate at eighteen. Not me. Now I find her but I don’t need a human mate, I need a wolf. Someone who is strong and can help me lead. There has to be some kind of mistake. I’m going to be the Alpha in a year. I can't have a human Luna. My pack will never accept her. “ Don’t you dare reject my mate. I will make you regret it. I’m warning you.” Razor growls. “ Calm down. You know we can’t have her. But I don’t have to reject her. I will spare you the pain. But I won’t accept her either. She is human. She won’t know. We will find a strong she-wolf for us.” “ I will never accept anyone but our mate. Don’t mess with me on this. She is important. She is special. I need her and only her. You hurt her, I hurt you.” Razor says before he blocks me out. I didn’t know he could do that. I call out to him but I get nothing but a wall. I’ll deal with him later. I know what I’m doing, he is just going to have to trust me on this. I let go of Lexie’s hand and went back to the table ignoring what happened.",2,1747391450.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False

Don’t get me wrong I want to date. But for some reason, my gut told me not to go. I have to wait. For what I don’t know. I have always trusted my instincts so I’m waiting. My mom used to call it my inner voice and I should pay attention. And I always have.

“ Oh, Lexi” Patsy starts as an elderly couple comes in and sits in her section. “ back to work but this conversation isn’t over,” she says and goes to greet her customers. When it comes to me I swear Patsy is like a dog with a bone. So I know she won’t let this go even though I wish she would. A steady stream of customers comes in, keeping us busy for a while. I for one am grateful for it. It makes the shift go by faster and I can avoid Patsy’s questions. I know her heart is in the right place but I don’t feel like discussing my love life especially for something I don’t understand myself. It isn’t as if I don’t want someone but I’m holding on to what my gut says. I feel it will be worth it in the end.

As quickly as everyone came in I swear they all left at the same time. Now it is just Patsy me and our cook. Patsy and I are clearing tables and cleaning up. “ Help me finish up and then you can take the back booth to study for a while,” Patsy says. I’m about to argue with her but before I can get my mouth open she continues “ If we get busy I’ll come to get you. The snow is coming down pretty good so I don’t think that we will get many people in if any at all.” I agree with her “ Ok, but I will lock up and you go home early for a change.” Patsy smiles big “ Kiddo, you have got yourself a deal.”

Patsy was right, we stayed empty while we finished our clean-up. I grabbed my backpack and went to the very last booth in the back so I would be out of the way in case any customers came in. I have my books spread out all over the table with my notebooks in front of me. I was so involved in my work I didn’t notice Patsy had brought me another cup of tea until she tapped me on the shoulder. “ Hey, drink up,” she says. “ How’s the homework going?” she asked. “ Not bad. I think I’m almost finished. And the best part is I think I understand most of it..” Patsy laughs “ I’m sure you understand more than you think. I know how smart you are even if you don’t. I know you graduated high school with honors.” “ High school was easy. This stuff, not so much.” I say. Patsy just squeezes me in support. “ I’ll leave you to it.” and she goes back to the counter to read her book. I envy her sometimes. I can’t remember the last time I read for fun.

# Chapter 2

Lexie

By the time I am finished, it looks like a ghost town outside so I didn’t have to worry about customers. I had just put my backpack away when a group of four came in. Three guys and one girl. They are regulars but always sit in Patsy’s section so I have never interacted with them. Patsy called out to them “ Go ahead and grab a seat anywhere Aden.” She turns to me and says “ Why don’t you take them? My feet are killing me and I want to sit a bit longer.” I look at her puzzled “ They are in your section. They always sit in your section. I can’t take your customers.” Pasty grabs my hand and we go over to the group.

“Hello,” she says “Would it be alright if Lexi here waits on you tonight?” The girl in the group lowers her eyes as if she disapproves but one of the guys spoke up “ Sure Patsy, that is fine with us.” As he looks me up and down with interest in his eyes. Patsy walks away but I didn’t miss the mischievous look in her eyes. I get the feeling I’m being set up. I turn my attention to the group. “ So what can I get you?” I ask as I take my pad and pen out of my apron. I feel all their eyes on me three with interest or at least curiosity. But the girl looked at me in what I think may be disgust. I don’t know what her problem is but I ignore it and do my job. “ Just coffee.” the girl snaps. I’m getting odd vibes from this group and I can’t fully place it. The girl is giving me the creeps and I feel the need to get away from her fast. But one of the guys is giving off a calming vibe but with them so close together I can’t tell who it is. So I am getting confused.

“ Sure. Anything else?” I ask, trying to keep my calm and my voice steady. My body is sending all kinds of signals. I can’t weed them out and I don’t like it. “ No, just coffee. And make it quick.” The girl snaps again. What is her problem? I know I have never done anything to her since this is the first time I have ever talked to them. “ Miss, I’ll have a slice of apple pie as well please.” the guy to the right of me asks. Relieved to be able to get away from them I smile at him.” Sure. I’ll get your order right away.” and quickly walk to the counter trying to shake off this weird feeling.

Aiden

When the waitress walks away I look at Melissa to figure out what her problem is. She never snaps at anyone. “ What the hell, Melissa?” I whisper. I know she can hear me. You see not a lot of people know this but we are wolves. I mean we can turn into wolves. We have a few names werewolves and shapeshifters are the most common but I prefer shifters. But I’ll explain more later. I want to know what Melissa’s problem is. She looks at me with confusion in her eyes. “ I don’t know. I didn’t mean to snap. But there is something off about her.” Melissa shakes her head like she is getting her thoughts together. “ No, not off. Different. I sense something in her but I don’t know what. My wolf Amber feels like she has to protect her but my human says push her away. I didn’t know what to do so I snapped.”

I felt something too but like Melissa said I don’t know what. I looked at Jesse and Jackson to see if they felt anything. “ I felt something too. Remus says to keep her close. So I listen to him.” Jesse says. We all learned in the past to trust his wolf, Remus. It is like he has a super sense about these things. Jackson adds “ I could feel something but like Melissa said I don’t know what. It was almost as if I could feel some wolf in her. Some traits at least. Trip says he feels like she is important but doesn’t know in what way. But he agrees with Remus and Amber that we have to keep her safe.”

I lean back and have a chat with my wolf who has been trying to get my attention ever since Lexie came to the table. “ Razor, what do you think?” I ask. “ There is something about her. I can sense wolf but not much. For now, she is mostly human.” he says. “ What do you mean for now?” “ I’m not sure. But I feel we need to keep her close and safe. She is very important and I feel she probably doesn’t know it. I feel the Goddess at work here. And I feel she is important to you and me.” “ Ok Razor.” I agree. Razor has a good sense when the Goddess is involved even though he hasn’t felt anything in years.

I look at the others “ We need to talk to the elders but we also need to find out more about her. All of our wolves agree she is important. We need to listen to them. Razor says the Goddess is involved but he doesn’t have the answers yet. He says Lexie may not know what it is or what she is. So we can’t say anything until we know more.” When we are all agreed I go to the counter to try and talk to Lexie or get a better feel for her at least.

When I get to the counter Lexie has her back to me. “ Excuse me, miss.” She turns around and smiles. A smile that makes me feel like all is right with the world. Her presence is calming even though I wasn’t stressed. “ Yes. Was there something else I could get for you?” Lexi asked. How did I not notice that her voice sounded like music to my ears? Almost like angels singing with a hint of a southern accent to it. I took a minute to get a good look at her. I looked her over from head to toe. Not one inch of her escaped my eyes. Damn, she had a body on her. Tits I swear are at least 36 double c’s and would love to bury my face between. Nice wide hips that were made for holding and I could see my hands on. You could see she had a bit of a tummy but not huge and not tight either. And her ass well, shit it was perfect globes that were more than a handful just the way I like it. Lexie is without a doubt the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes on with a perfect curvy body.

I looked back at her face and was caught in her eyes. They are bright aquamarine green, an unusual color, yes but that isn’t the only thing that gets your attention. It was the fact I truly believe they were glowing. I realized I was staring too long when Lexie started to twitch like she was uncomfortable. “ Sorry. No, we don’t need anything. I just wanted to apologize for the way my sister acted. She doesn’t mean to be harsh, it just comes across that way sometimes.” Lexi nods “ It is ok. Really. You don’t need to apologize. She is used to Patsy.” “ There is still no excuse to be rude,” I tell her. She is pouring coffee. “ If you want to go sit back down I’ll bring you coffee over to you.” I feel like I’m being dismissed but I don’t want to leave her yet. I feel like I can’t. Even Razor is telling me to keep her talking. To stay close to her. The guy is jumping around in my head like a damn puppy.

“ Razor, what is your problem?” I ask. “ I need to be closer. I need to touch her,” he growls. “ You need to calm down or you will scare her,” I tell him. He huffs and goes to the back of my mind. “ Are you ok?” I hear Lexie ask, pulling my attention. I clear my throat “ Yes, I’m good. Why do you ask?” Lexie shakes her head “ Nothing it is just your eyes changed color for a minute that’s all.” Shit, I didn’t mean for her to see that. “ I’m sorry if I scared you. I was just thinking about something.” Lexie laughs “ You looked pretty deep in thought. But I wasn’t scared. My eyes do that all the time” That’s interesting. The only people I know whose eyes change are wolves.

“ They do?” I asked, needing to know more. Lexie grabs Jesse’s pie and places it on the counter getting ready to take everything to our table. “ Yea, it freaked me out the first time it happened but over the years I got used to it. My grandma called them mood eyes.” Lexi shakes her head “ And you didn’t want to know all that. Sorry.” Actually, I do want to know but I don’t tell her that. “ I’m headed back to your table if you want to go back to your friends.” I nod and turn around. But turn back to her and hold out my hand “ I’m Aiden.” “ Lexie as you know. It is nice to meet you.” When she grabs my hand to shake it I feel like I have been struck by lightning. It runs up my arm and completely through my body. Razor shouts “ Mate. Mate.” over and over again. He won’t stop. That’s when the smell hits me. Oranges and the ocean. It is coming from Lexie. How did I not notice it before? “ Get mate. Need mate.” Razor is all but screaming at me.

No. No. This can’t be happening. I waited two years to find my mate for this. Most wolves find their mate at eighteen. Not me. Now I find her but I don’t need a human mate, I need a wolf. Someone who is strong and can help me lead. There has to be some kind of mistake. I’m going to be the Alpha in a year. I can't have a human Luna. My pack will never accept her. “ Don’t you dare reject my mate. I will make you regret it. I’m warning you.” Razor growls. “ Calm down. You know we can’t have her. But I don’t have to reject her. I will spare you the pain. But I won’t accept her either. She is human. She won’t know. We will find a strong she-wolf for us.” “ I will never accept anyone but our mate. Don’t mess with me on this. She is important. She is special. I need her and only her. You hurt her, I hurt you.” Razor says before he blocks me out. I didn’t know he could do that. I call out to him but I get nothing but a wall. I’ll deal with him later. I know what I’m doing, he is just going to have to trust me on this. I let go of Lexie’s hand and went back to the table ignoring what happened.",1,1747391449.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Lexie

At first glance, you would think I’m just an average nineteen-year-old girl. There is nothing about me that stands out if you aren’t looking. I work in a family-run diner in Gwinn, Michigan. I go to the university here to study Zoology. I live by myself in a small two-story house at the edge of town. See plain and simple and until recently I would have completely agreed with you. My name is Alexandria, Lexie for short. And this is the story of where my life changes into a magical story you only see in movies or books.

It started on the first day of the snow season and the ground was already coated in a foot of fluffy white stuff and was steadily coming down. “ So this is light snow flurries,” I say to myself shaking my head. I pull my coat closer around me and get in my midnight blue nineteen ninety eight Chevy silverado.Don’t laugh, my dad bought it cheap for me when I got my license. We fixed up together to get it running like a dream. I toss my backpack in the passenger seat and start the truck hoping it will heat up quickly.

My work uniform was not designed for warmth. It is a red and white striped dress that goes to my knees. And flares at my waist showing off my hips and ass. A top that unfortunately shows too much cleavage for my taste. Add red pantyhose and white shoes and the outfit is complete. Add to the look my scarlet red hair pulled up in a ponytail and a white scarf. Honestly, I look like a five-foot-seven-inch candy cane and a fifties car hop merged. Yes, I’m tall but I have an abundance of curves that my uniform does nothing to hide. I have an hourglass figure that I’m damn proud of but the outfit shows off a bit much of it.

I think my boss has a thing for the fifties because the diner is the same way but hey it is a job. A job that pays the bills and works around my school schedule. Plus the people I work with are great and the customers are always nice and tip pretty well. I pull into the small parking lot across the street from the diner. Figures just as I started to warm up I have to get back out in the snow again. I grab my backpack, shove my keys in the pocket of my jacket and lock up. I walk as quickly as I can, without slipping and falling on my ass, to the diner.

The diner itself is a cute little L shaped place. Bright red booths line the outside walls and the front windows. Silver two-person tables with red Formica tops and silver chairs with red cushions are set in the middle between the booths and the counter. The counter takes up the rest of the front of the diner. The kitchen is behind the counter with a large rectangular window where we receive orders.Down the hall are bathrooms, locker room, as well as the office. The floor makes it all stand out with black and white checkered tiles. It has a fifties feel to it when you see the vintage records and old posters hanging on the walls.

“Hey, kiddo,” Patsy greets me with a warm smile from where she stands behind the counter. Patsy is a sweet lady in her mid-sixties I think, not that I would ever ask. She is a petite woman about five foot three inches with light brown hair that she always keeps in a tight bun. One of the best things about Patsy is no matter what time of day it is she is always in a good mood. I do enjoy working with her. “ How are you enjoying the first snow?” Patsy asks.

Shaking the snow from my hair and jacket I answer “ I don’t know if I will ever get used to it. I’m freezing. I have never been in snow before. I don’t know how to handle it. I’m from Florida for crying out loud.” Patsy just smiles. “ Don’t worry. I know you will be just fine. Just remember what I told you about layering up. Now get your butt over here and help me.” I put my backpack in the backroom and headed back to help Patsy.

“ Where do you want me to start?” I ask while Patsy puts on a fresh pot of coffee. “ Here, sip this while you get the silverware ready. She says when she hands me a cup of hot tea with honey. “ It should help warm you up.” she continues. I sit at the very end of the counter wrapping spoons, forks and knives together as I sip my tea. Patsy was right, it is warming me up. She grabs the salt shakers to refill them and sits next to me. The diner is empty so now is perfect for what Patsy calls girl time. Which is just her way of checking on me. She has been doing it since I moved here.

“ How’s school going? How do you like your classes?” she asks. “ It is going well. The professors are ok. The homework is a bit more than I expected so I have to study every chance I get to keep my grades up.” I say. “ Lexi, honey you can’t live your life in books. I know this is important to you but what about friends? Have you made any yet? I know you haven’t gone to any parties or on any dates.” I almost spit out the tea I just took a sip of and start coughing. I have to catch my breath to answer “ Patsy, I’m fine. I have been asked to join a few study groups. Parties aren’t my thing. And as for dates, I don’t have time. I am happy spending time with you and my books.” I told her.

For the most part, it is except for the dating part. I don’t date. I never have. I have been asked out a few times over the years and even a few times since I moved here but I always declined. Don’t get me wrong I want to date. But for some reason, my gut told me not to go. I have to wait. For what I don’t know. I have always trusted my instincts so I’m waiting. My mom used to call it my inner voice and I should pay attention. And I always have.

“ Oh, Lexi” Patsy starts as an elderly couple comes in and sits in her section. “ back to work but this conversation isn’t over,” she says and goes to greet her customers. When it comes to me I swear Patsy is like a dog with a bone. So I know she won’t let this go even though I wish she would. A steady stream of customers comes in, keeping us busy for a while. I for one am grateful for it. It makes the shift go by faster and I can avoid Patsy’s questions.

Basically: Tinder for study sessions meets Google Calendar on low budget caffeine.

# Who’s it for?

Uni students, especially Gen Z. They’re distracted, anxious, and lonely - we’re just trying to turn that into productivity instead of another scroll hole.

# Why it’s not (completely) useless:

Most ""productivity apps"" are solo or generic.  
We focus on **campus-based, exam-specific matching**, and accountability through actual humans, not badges (maybe also badges in the future).

# Stage:

* App is live.
* 1500+ users
* Collaborating with 1 university.
* Trying to sell licenses to unis (pray for us).
* Not raising yet, but open to interest

# Why us?

Two co-founders from Italy (ciao belli): one builds, the other suffers, and sells  
No rich parents, just coffee, hard work and trauma.

1knxgla,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1knxgla/closure_letter/,Closure Letter,"This my closure letter as a recovering avoidant. Yes hse could have done a lot of things differently and ""not gave up"", but at the end 80% was my responsibility and I must work on resolving my issues.

Tge odd thing about this breakup is the amount of care that she showed to me.

She was there when I had my first ever panic attack, even when I got suicidal for a day. 

She was encouraging me to work on myself and helped me not fall into depression post breakup. 

She admitted it was hard for her to support me, but she was willing to take it at my pace - to slowly transition to no contact so we can heal. 

We met multiple times after the breakup  she was always so warm and loving, the look in her eyes and her soft hugs. 

The warmth in her voice when I told her about my progress over the phone. 

Before the no contact we saw each other for the last time and couldn't leave each other for 30 minutes. We hugging each other, we were so happy - yet so sad. We knew It has to go this way.

Yes she could've done things better, she kind of blindsided me (just partially, she did try to communicate about issues, but did not communicate about her feelings changing), yes her rebound is probably a mistake.

But I'm not perfect and neither is she. We are just two hurt people who deeply care about each other and couldn't make it work. Some day maybe? But not now. 

I have finally accepted that I can move on as well. I'm going on a date soon and all is looking well.

==============================================

This is the letter that I'm thinking of sending her next week - because I don't want to leave some things unsaid. Currently we are in no contact on my initiative. 


Dear A,

I’m writing to you not as a man asking to return, but as someone who has learned to protect the light that was once ours — and who believes that light can still illuminate the path, even if we no longer walk it together.

I remember those nights when you held me quietly, while I was drowning in my own thoughts. Your embrace was a salvation, but also a turning point. You were the first to see my wounds and not run away. Even when I, unconsciously, made you feel unloved, you stayed. Not out of weakness, but out of faith — that we could be more than two wounded people trying to find each other in the chaos of the world.

I know you were sometimes afraid your needs would be seen as a burden, just as I was afraid I’d lose control if I allowed myself to be fully seen. But in those moments when it was just you and me — without words, without masks, without plans — there was a spark. It wasn’t perfect, but it was real. It was ours.

Today, after many conversations with myself, my therapist, and days of reflection, I can admit how much I hurt you by keeping my vulnerability locked away, and by ignoring yours out of my own fear. I was a man who longed for love but didn’t know how to receive it. And you offered it to me — not out of idealization, but out of courage and belief.

I’m sorry I didn’t know how to be the man you deserved — not perfect, but present and secure enough that your hands didn’t always have to heal him. I’m sorry I left you alone in the moments when you most needed support. But thank you — for teaching me what true closeness means, even when it hurts.

What I want you to know:
Your words still echo within me, like a quiet reminder of how rare and real what we had was.
I’ve learned to love without reservations — first myself, then others.
Your warmth, your struggle with anxiety, your trust in me — all of that changed me. It taught me tenderness.

If you ever feel like sharing a cup of coffee, or walking through the park that meant something to us, know that I’ll always make time. Not to revive the past, but maybe to discover something new — if we’re both ever ready.

True love doesn’t disappear. It changes, it grows quiet, it grows… or it waits. Whether it becomes friendship one day, or something deeper — I don’t know. But I do know I’ll always carry a space in my heart for what we were. And maybe, for what we could be — if life brings us together again when we are fully ourselves.

No pressure. No expectations. Just sincere respect for all that we shared.

Maybe we didn’t succeed back then, but maybe we haven’t said the final word either. And even if we have — I’m grateful I got to say it to you.

I think I’m finally ready to move on. 

Always,
N
