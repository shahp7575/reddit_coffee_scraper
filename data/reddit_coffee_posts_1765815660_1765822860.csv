I have recently been gifted a gaggia classic together with a timemore chestnut hand grinder. Thats all, equipment-wise I have at the moment. So far I had a blast playing around with grind sizes and brewing my own espresso, but I was wondering what kind of investment would be the most influential for improving my results. I have been doing a bit of research, and everyone online tells you about so many things that are supposedly absolutely crucial for good Espresso, and honestly I feel a little lost. Which has the biggest impact on my results? What would be next for you? What I have heard so far is ""super important"":

   * 9 Bar OPV
   * splurging on Speciality Coffe beans
   * a precision scale for weighing out doses
   * high precision baskets/bottomless portafilter
   * a WDT tool (been breaking of clumps with a fork so far)
   * self leveling tamper
   * a better grinder
   * possibly many more things...?

as written in the title, my budget is pretty limited for now, and I'd like to keep some middle ground between ""crazy coffee person"" while still enjoying good espresso.

I have picked up espresso drinking in Italy if that matters, so for now I am have been drinking single shots made with medium priced supermarket coffe.

I'd love to hear your thoughts!",1,1765821398.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

The Dolphins have been *notoriously* terrible in cold weather. If this game were happening in Miami I’d have a much different take, but it’s 14°F (-10.0°C) in Pittsburgh today and I don’t doubt that the Steelers will play the better game because of it. I came across a hilarious (and slightly tragic) stat this morning: QB Tua Tagovailoa is 0–7 in games played below 40°F –  tonight we’ll be well under that threshold. Unfortunately, while the Dolphins have been able to string together some nice wins, this spot favors the Steelers in every way that matters, friends. My money’s on Pittsburgh to cover.

[Bambino Plus]","I'm able to get relatively good espresso out of my BBP, but some shots are better than others. There really isn't much to the machine, so I am looking at puck prep. I'm not sure what it is about the portafilter and basket, but I almost always make some kind of mess, at least a little bit.

I grind into a dosing cup, pour into portafilter with a Normcore dosing ring. WDT using a modified/clipped keyboard cap puller, tap several times to get the grounds to settle enough to remove the funnel, and then tamp. Even with the tamper registered against the edge of the portafilter, I can sometimes get an uneven tamp since the basket is so full. I also have a bit of extra grounds around the edge of the portafilter that I blow off before putting on a puck paper.

The coffee is good and the Breville razor shows that I am not overfilling the basket after a tamp, but the videos I watch are much easier, especially during WDT which almost always threatens to ""slosh"" the grounds over the edge of the funnel, though this doesn't happen often.

I think a matching funnel/distributor/tamper kit like that from Crema or would be helpful, and I'd be able to print and use [this umikot design](https://www.printables.com/model/1355927-knurled-direct-dosing-funnel-model) for an all-in-one setup. Before I start throwing money at the problem, I'm wondering if there are any other tips people have found for clean consistency, or if this is just the way of the world with the Breville.",1,1765821202.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1pne0xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/taxPH/comments/1pne0xd/selfemployed_statutory_contributions_tax_planning/,Self-employed: Statutory contributions & Tax Planning,"Hello, I'll be starting as a 'contractor' who is still working here in PH for a foreign firm/company next year (under a 'direct hire setup'; **Basically, I'll be self-employed)**.

**if I am not asking too much, please help me out hehehe to minimize my statutory contributions and increase my tax savings. I'm CPA but bobo sa TAX and Law HAHAHA. I can treat you to lunch/dinner/coffee lol.**

To all self-employed fellas out there, can you please share your tax planning and statutory contribution \[Pag-ibig / Philhealth / SSS\] planning when you became a self-employed individual who has to pay the maximum statutory contribution for each of those that I've mentioned.

Here is what I'm planning to do based on the latest and applicable statutory requirements (haven't fully read all the relevant articles for these, antok na me, **but please feel free to correct me if I had the wrong understanding and interpretation**)

1. Tax - I will opt for the 8% preferential/flat tax rate as I'll have more tax savings based on my initial calculation.
2. SSS - Fuck this! I want to break the law haha but it looks like I can't escape contributing Php 5,280 monthly as self-employed member. I'm still trying to figure this out so that the long-term benefit when I retire won't be affected. Perhaps, I can lower the contribution depending on the retirement payout/pension?
3. Pag-ibig - I believe I can pay the minimum monthly contribution of Php 400?? I'm not looking into any investment vehicle or loan product from Pag-ibig **at least not for now**. I believe I can top up naman the contribution if there's some Pag-ibig loans/benefits that I want to enter in the future????
4. Philhealth - According to [taxcalculator.org](http://taxcalculator.org) I was supposed to contribute Php 5,000 monthly but same with Pag-ibig I'm planning to pay the minimum monthly contribution of Php 100. I read a post before that I'll have the same benefit with someone who is contributing/paying any amount of premium to Philhealth?? I have 2 traditional insurance policies (comprehensive plans that cover health, medical & hospitalization + life). I also have Medicard Select as my HMO. I would trust private insurance companies to take care of me in the future hahaha.

**Questions (perhaps, I'm not sure which is more beneficial, or this setup will fck up any credit card/VISA or any other major document application in the future):**

A. RE: SSS - Is there a way for me to further minimize my contribution? Anyone here has performed detailed cost-benefit analysis of my concern above (RE: pension)?

B. RE: Pag-ibig - Can I just really pay the minimum contribution? Can I top up the contribution if I decided to enter into or avail any Pag-ibig loans/benefits?

C. RE: Philhealth - Can I just really pay the minimum contribution? Will there be any conflict in the future if I make a claim to Philhealth/HMO/Insurance for my hospital bills? I'm talking about the Philhealth coverage VS. my HMO & Insurance coverage.

D. ITR Reconciliation / Withholding tax final calculation - will there be any problem based on the information above?

I'm looking at a possible tax savings of around 21k monthly if the 'planned setup' would work",1,1765821201.0,taxPH,0,1.0,False

It sat in my bones like it had been poured into me, filling the spaces between my ribs, settling in my marrow. I opened my eyes to fluorescent glare and sterile white walls, machines humming somewhere just out of sight. A hospital at first glance. But hospitals don’t smell like this.

The air stank of antiseptic and metal, and underneath that, something foul—burned hair, spoiled meat, old blood clinging to vents and tile.

I tried to move.

Restraints bit into my wrists and ankles. Thick, metal, too tight to be medical. Panic hit me all at once, sharp and electric.

Where the hell was I?

A speaker crackled overhead. The voice that came through was male, clinical, and completely empty.

“Subject 18C is awake. Increased durability and metabolic response confirmed. Beginning Phase Three.”

A hiss answered him. Gas flooded from the vents above.

I held my breath as long as I could, lungs burning, eyes watering. The second I broke and inhaled, something changed. Heat rolled through my veins. My heart slammed against my ribs hard enough that I could feel the vibration in the restraints. My muscles lit up, not just sore, but alive, like every fiber was being rewired.

A deep, twisting ache started in my bones, as if something small and vicious was burrowing through my marrow. My spine felt wrong—too long, too tight, like it didn’t quite fit inside me anymore. I shifted my shoulders and a loud, wet crack echoed in the room.

For a moment I thought it came from the walls.

Then I realized it was me.

My heart shouldn’t have been able to beat that fast. My blood shouldn’t have felt like it was moving on its own.

I yanked at the restraints again.

This time, the steel didn’t just hold. It bent.

The intercom buzzed. The voice came back, same man, but now there was something new underneath the clinical tone.

Surprise.

“Subject 18C is exceeding expected thresholds.”

I wasn’t supposed to do that. In their heads, I was supposed to stay weak, compliant.

Human.

A door hissed open to my left. Heavy boots hit the floor in a quick, practiced rhythm. Five men in tactical gear rushed in, rifles raised, visors hiding their faces and turning them into moving reflections of the overhead lights.

“Restrain him,” one of them barked.

Another stepped forward, a syringe glinting in his gloved hand. I let him come close. Let them believe the restraints still meant something.

Then I moved.

I don’t have a neat way to explain it. One second I was still; the next, my body was already where it needed to be. My hand snapped up, closing around his wrist before he could react.

I squeezed.

Something inside his arm popped.

He screamed and dropped to his knees. His wrist didn’t just break—it folded in on itself. Bone crunched and ground under my grip, splintering through his skin. White shards pushed out through torn flesh. His scream changed, rising into something raw and broken. Not just pain. Fear.

Like some part of him understood I wasn’t the same as the thing strapped to this bed a minute ago.

The others opened fire.

I should’ve died.

Instead, the room slowed down around me.

The muzzle flashes strobed in my peripheral vision. I saw the bullets in the air—not frozen, but dragging, like the world was moving through syrup and I was the only one who’d stepped out of it. My body reacted on its own; I twisted, ducked, shifted an inch and felt metal pass close enough to tug at my hospital gown.

Then something sharp punched into my chest.

Not a bullet.

A dart.

Cold spread from the impact point. My legs went heavy. A numbness crawled up my spine.

I hit the floor hard. My mind kept screaming long after my body stopped being able to move.

The last thing I heard before it all went black was the same voice over the speaker, calm again.

“Let’s see how quickly he recovers.”

When I woke, everything was different.

New room. No restraints. No tactical team on standby.

Just a steel table, two chairs, and a man in a suit sitting across from me like this was a job interview.

He studied me for a long moment, fingers folded under his chin.

“You’re adjusting faster than expected,” he said.

I stayed quiet. My body still felt wrong—too wired, too strong, like there was a half-second delay between what I thought and what my muscles wanted to do. I wasn’t about to tell him that.

He leaned forward. “You’re an asset now. Subject 18 of the Cryothium experiments. A weapon. We can help you refine your abilities. Give you purpose.”

I met his eyes. “And if I refuse?”

The corner of his mouth twitched up. Not quite a smile.

“You won’t.”

It wasn’t a threat.

It was certainty.

I looked past him, at the door. Ten feet away. Maybe less. I could feel the strength in my arms, the coil of power in my legs. Some new instinct kept whispering that I could be on him and through that door before he finished a sentence.

They’d be ready for that.

They already knew how fast I could move.

So I forced myself to breathe. Slow. Even.

If they wanted me to play along, I’d play along—until I knew enough to stop.

I leaned back in the chair, flexing my fingers, feeling that unnatural strength simmer under my skin.

“I’m listening,” I said.

This time the smile landed.

“Good,” he said. “Welcome to The Division.”

They trained me quickly after that. Not because they cared about me. Because they’d invested too much not to.

The Division wasn’t on any official chart. No website. No congressional record. A black-budget agency buried under so many layers of classification that even people in the Pentagon only saw rumors.

Their job was simple.

Containment.

Eradication.

Hunting things the world didn’t have names for yet and making sure it never learned them.

Cryptids. Aberrations. Anomalies. The official terms didn’t matter. Monsters did.

I was part of Project Revenant. One of a small group of human test subjects they’d put through experimental procedures—Cryothium infusions, gene splicing, surgeries I only remember as flashes of bright light and pressure.

They weren’t trying to build cape-wearing heroes. They were trying to build something that could look a monster in the eyes and not die in the first thirty seconds.

The first few months were hell.

They shot me to see how fast I healed. Dropped me from heights to gauge bone density. Cut me open under anesthesia and then woke me up halfway through to monitor pain response and regeneration.

I learned I could take bullets and stay on my feet.

That my body rebuilt itself in hours instead of days.

That my senses were off the chart—I could pick out a heartbeat through a wall, track a footstep across concrete, see in the dark like it was dim daylight.

But I also learned something else.

I wasn’t immortal.

There was always a point where enough damage would kill me. And the things we hunted lived comfortably past that line.

My first mission was supposed to be routine.

It was a baptism instead.

Small town in Montana. Population in the hundreds. Thick woods wrapped around it on all sides. People had been vanishing for months, and the ones they found didn’t look like anything you’d put in a casket.

They were hollow.

Not mauled. Not eaten in the way you think of when you picture teeth and claws. Emptied. Like something had crawled inside, fed from the inside out, and then left the shell behind.

Locals whispered one name when the sun went down.

The Skinned Man.

The Division’s report called it an Atypical Class-4 Predator. On the internal chatter, field agents called it an Apex.

I called it a monster.

They sent me in with a team of five veteran operatives. They had years of experience, scars, quiet voices, and eyes that didn’t flinch at crime scene photos.

I had a serial number and a body that didn’t feel like it belonged to me.

By morning, I was the only one alive.

The Skinned Man moved through the trees too fast to track properly. Limbs too long, joints bending in directions no human knee or elbow should go. It climbed like a spider and dropped like a falling knife.

Its skin wasn’t stretched tight over muscle the way ours is. It shifted. Ripples moved under the surface like hands pushing from the inside. Tendons snapped into new positions with wet pops. When it grinned, its jaw kept going, hinge opening wider than the skull should allow, rows of thin, jagged teeth clacking together like they were impatient.

We hit it with everything we had. Bullets shredded flesh and bone, but it kept coming. Fire worked better. Fire made it scream.

And in the middle of that, I learned something new about myself.

When it lunged for me, claws out, my brain barely had time to register it.

My body did.

The world slowed the way it had in the lab. I stepped aside, brought my hands up, and they found its throat like we’d practiced this a thousand times. I squeezed.

Cartilage buckled. The spine twisted. I felt every fragile structure in its neck collapse.

And for one awful second, I liked the way it felt.

That was the first time I understood that whatever they’d set loose inside me wasn’t just strength.

It was hunger.

I burned what was left of the Skinned Man. Stood there until the fire burned low and the smell of it sank into my clothes and hair.

I told myself it was because I didn’t want it coming back.

I told myself I was still human.

The years after that blurred.

Mission after mission. Town after town.

A voice-mimicking thing in the Appalachians that called hikers off the trail using the voices of people they trusted, then left their bones in neat piles under overhangs.

An abandoned government bunker where something that had started as human but wasn’t anymore walked the halls and spoke in overlapping voices that followed you in your dreams.

A coastal community where a “disease” left people bloated and hot to the touch, their skin squirming with things that moved just under the surface. When they died, those things didn’t.

Every time, they sent me in.

Every time, I came back different.

Scars I shouldn’t have kept. Nightmares I couldn’t shake. A growing, quiet part of me that responded to the things we hunted in ways no training manual could explain.

I kept telling myself we were doing the right thing—that The Division was a necessary evil keeping worse things at bay.

But there were nights when I caught my reflection and didn’t recognize my own eyes. Not just because they looked tired. Because they looked… hungry.

The job changed me.

Not just in the obvious ways. Sure, I was stronger, faster, harder to kill. But I started to feel them before I ever saw them. Not in some mystical way. It was like a pressure in the air, a weight behind my eyes, a static hum under my skin.

Sometimes, staring into the dark, planning a route or deciding whether to bait or flank, thoughts would surface that didn’t feel like mine. Efficient. Cold. Predatory.

I wrote it off as experience. Instinct. The sort of thing that happens when you survive long enough doing a job no one else wants.

Now I’m not so sure.

Because last night, I found something they never meant for me to see.

And today, I met a monster that knew my name.

Chapter 3. Project Revenant.

They called it a simple containment op.

An Apex Class Anomaly had been reported near an abandoned hospital in rural Wyoming. Locals heard noises at night—deep, inhuman shrieks that cut off mid-scream. No visual confirmation, no bodies. The Division tagged it as a Spectral Aberration, likely bound to whatever grief had soaked into the place when it was still active.

I’d dealt with similar things before.

But this time, there was a difference.

No team.

No backup.

Just me.

That should’ve been the first warning.

The hospital was dead. A long, rotting structure folded into the tree line, glass blown out, doors hanging crooked. Mold climbed the walls in dark veins. The floor sagged in places, swollen with water damage. Every step stirred dust and the stale smell of old sickness.

Beneath that, I smelled something else.

Like the lab.

Something chemical. Something wrong.

I knew I wasn’t alone before I even stepped inside.

There’s a particular kind of quiet that comes before a fight. The air seems to hold its breath with you. That feeling crawled up my back as I moved through the hallway, flashlight beam cutting across peeling paint, rusted gurneys, abandoned equipment.

Half the doors were stuck. The other half opened to empty rooms or collapsed ceilings.

Then I saw one door already hanging open.

Inside, the walls were plastered with paper. Old reports. Patient charts. Some had yellowed so badly that the ink was just ghosts of letters. When I touched one, the corner crumbled.

One file looked different.

It was sealed in a clear plastic sleeve. Thick. Intact. Marked in bold black letters:

PROJECT REVENANT.

My project.

My throat went dry.

I pulled it free and flipped it open.

Rows of text stared back at me—dense language, medical jargon, test IDs. I skimmed.

Subject 18C exhibits unprecedented neural adaptation to foreign genetic sequences.

Metabolic activity indicates sustained compatibility with nonhuman physiology.

Projected maximum lift: several tons, pending further controlled testing.

Regeneration window expected to shorten over time.

Further mutations projected. Long-term psychological profile: indeterminate.

Then my eyes caught on the margin.

A handwritten note, scrawled between paragraphs.

The others didn’t survive. But he did. Why?

The bottom dropped out of my stomach.

The others.

No one had ever told me there were others.

My heart pounded in my ears. I turned the page. Medical images bloomed across the paper—MRIs, skeletal scans, charts. Bones that looked almost human, but not quite. A skull with extra thickness along the frontal bone. A ribcage too dense. Fingers that seemed a fraction longer than they should’ve been.

My fingers.

My bones.

I snapped the file shut so hard the plastic creaked. My hands were shaking.

I needed to get out of that room.

That was when the voice came from the doorway behind me.

“You weren’t supposed to find that.”

Deep. Familiar in a way that hit somewhere under my ribs. And wrong.

I turned, gun already in my hand.

And froze.

At a glance, it could’ve passed for a man. Tall. Broad. Dressed in what used to be a Division field uniform, the fabric torn and stained. But the shape was off. Muscles shifted under the skin like they weren’t anchored properly. The flesh itself moved too much, crawling in slow waves across its frame, adjusting, correcting.

Its eyes found mine.

It smiled.

“Hello, brother.”

The word landed heavier than the gun in my grip.

I didn’t answer.

Couldn’t.

It chuckled, head tilting just a little too far. “You really don’t remember, do you?”

I steadied my aim. “I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”

It breathed out slowly, the sound rattling like there was fluid in its lungs.

“They always scrub the memories,” it said. “Makes it easier when the failures start stacking up.”

My finger tightened on the trigger. “Failures?”

“You think you’re the first?” It lifted one hand, gesturing loosely at itself. The motion made the skin on its arm pull and then settle, like something underneath was lagging behind. “There were seventeen of us before you. Revenants. Some burned out in days. Others made it longer. Me?”

The grin twisted.

“I lasted years. Until they decided I wasn’t ‘human’ enough anymore.”

I shook my head. “You’re lying.”

“Then why do you feel it?” it asked softly.

Its gaze dropped to my hands.

The veins there pulsed darker than they used to, like something thick and foreign was running beside the blood.

I swallowed.

“You’ve noticed it,” it went on. “The instincts. The way you track them. The pull in your gut when something like us is near.”

I stayed silent.

Because I had noticed.

For years.

“Get out of my way,” I said.

The Revenant laughed under its breath. “You still think I’m the problem. You have no idea.”

It jerked its chin toward the ceiling, toward whatever level The Division had turned into a command nest for this op.

“They’re the ones who made us. They’re the ones who dump us in places like this when they get scared of what we’re becoming.”

The Division.

The men in suits. The doctors with dead eyes. The handler who’d sat across from me in that first interview and called me an asset.

For the first time in a long time, I hesitated.

I kept my gun trained on its head.

“You can walk out of here,” I said. “Face a tribunal. Maybe they can fix you.”

The Revenant’s laugh was sharper this time. “Fix me?”

It took a step forward. The shadows around its ankles seemed to cling instead of moving out of the way.

“They did this to me,” it said. “Same as they did to you. And the moment I couldn’t pass for human in daylight anymore, I turned into a line item. A risk assessment. Something to erase.”

The words slid under my skin like ice.

“You think you’re special?” it asked, voice dropping. “You’re just next.”

Far off, I heard it.

The faint chop of helicopter blades.

The Division was coming in.

I didn’t lower my gun.

The Revenant’s expression shifted. The amusement went out of its face, leaving something like resignation.

“I get it,” it said. “You need to believe you’re one of them. That everything they’ve made you do meant something.”

“Shut up,” I said.

“You ever ask why they keep sending you alone?” it pressed. “Why they don’t put you on teams anymore?”

I said nothing.

Because I had asked that question.

First I’d told myself I was just too valuable. Then I’d stopped asking.

“That’s not a promotion,” it said. “That’s quarantine.”

The words hung there.

“You’re not just stronger,” it said. “You’re changing. Same as I did. They’re waiting to see which side you land on, and when they don’t like the answer, they’ll do what they always do.”

I swallowed hard. “I’m not like you.”

Silence stretched between us.

Then it spoke, almost gently.

“Then why aren’t you afraid?”

I pulled the trigger.

The first round hit center mass. The impact rocked it backward, but it stayed on its feet.

Second shot took its shoulder, spinning it slightly.

It snarled, sound low and inhuman, but the smile never left its face. Something like satisfaction flickered there.

“There he is,” it rasped. “The real you.”

I didn’t stop shooting.

I emptied the magazine, each shot tearing through flesh that fought to hold its shape. Dark fluid splattered the wall behind it. Its movements grew jerky, limbs twitching in short, violent snaps.

I reached for my sidearm.

I was too slow.

One moment it was ten feet away.

The next, it was in front of me.

Its hand hit my throat like a hydraulic press. It lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing. My legs kicked, boots scraping against empty air. My fingers clawed at its grip and found nothing to leverage.

My vision narrowed. My pulse hammered against its fingers.

“You feel it,” it whispered.

Its eyes shone in the dim light, pupils blown wide.

“That thing inside you.”

The edges of the room blurred.

“It’s waking up.”

A gunshot cracked behind it.

Just one.

The Revenant’s skull snapped back, a hole punched clean through its forehead. Thick, dark fluid bubbled out, trailing down its face.

Its fingers spasmed around my throat, then slipped.

I dropped to the floor and hit hard, air tearing back into my lungs in ragged gulps.

The Revenant staggered, head tilted at an impossible angle. It made a gurgling noise, like it was trying to speak through a throat full of mud. Its arms jerked, hands curling like they were grabbing for something that wasn’t there.

Then it fell.

It hit the ground and convulsed once.

Twice.

Then it went still.

Behind it, framed in the doorway, pistol raised, stood Director Carter.

He didn’t look winded. Didn’t look surprised.

Just mildly annoyed, like someone had tracked mud onto his clean floor.

The distant thrum of helicopter blades grew louder, rattling the windows.

I pushed myself upright, throat burning. Carter lowered the pistol and stepped around the corpse, looking down at it with the detached interest of a man checking the weather.

“Didn’t think you’d need backup,” he said.

I wiped blood from my lips. “I had it under control.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Did you?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I didn’t know.

Carter holstered his weapon as Division operatives poured into the room, shouting to each other, securing doors, sweeping corners. He didn’t look at me again.

“Clean this up,” he said. “Burn the remains.”

They moved in fast, already treating the body like evidence, not like something that had called me brother.

Not like something that had once been human.

Maybe it hadn’t.

Maybe it was just another mission. Another monster on a long list.

So why did its words keep echoing in my head?

The op went down as a success.

The report left out most of what mattered.

No mention of the file I’d found. No mention of the way the Revenant spoke like it remembered my life better than I did.

Carter didn’t ask.

I didn’t volunteer.

Later, standing in the locker room under harsh fluorescent light, I peeled off my gear and caught sight of myself in the mirror.

The bruises ringing my throat—finger-shaped and dark—were already fading.

The ache in my ribs from where I’d hit the floor was gone.

Too fast.

I stared at my own hands. Watched the veins throb under the skin, thick and dark.

I told myself I was still human.

I kept telling myself that all the way down the hallway to Carter’s office.

The moment I stepped through his door, I knew I wasn’t leaving the same way.

Maybe I wasn’t leaving at all.

The overhead lights buzzed quietly. Steel walls. Clean desk. Carter behind it, fingers steepled, a thick folder in front of him. His expression was carved out of stone.

I dropped another folder on top of his.

This one was mine.

The Wendigo Survivor Report.

A man in his forties had stumbled out of the Montana wild a few years back. Frostbitten, starved, half-delirious. By every metric, he should’ve died. He didn’t.

He survived long enough to talk.

Long enough to describe what he’d seen in the trees. What he’d heard on the mountain.

Me.

Not clearly. Not by name. Just details that lined up too neatly with a mission that had never made it into public records.

The cleanup team reached him within hours.

The official cause of death: exposure-related complications.

The autopsy photos told a different story.

Someone had put a bullet in his head at close range.

“You had him killed,” I said. My voice came out flat, but heat crawled under my skin.

Carter didn’t look surprised. He flipped the folder open, scanned the first page like he was re-reading something he’d signed off on months ago.

“You should’ve left this buried,” he said.

“He lived,” I said. “That should’ve mattered.”

Carter finally lifted his eyes to mine.

And for the first time, I saw it.

A flicker.

A ripple that moved across his skin when he shifted in his chair. Veins too dark, beating with a pulse that didn’t match the one in his throat. When his pupils widened, they swallowed more of the iris than they should’ve, black spreading like ink.

The air around him seemed to bend, just slightly, like heat distortion on asphalt.

“You don’t understand what we’re protecting here,” he said calmly. “We don’t leave loose ends. He saw something that shouldn’t exist. Something that could rip the edge off everything we’ve built.”

“You mean me,” I said.

He didn’t deny it.

“You were never meant to be the hero, 18C. You were built as a weapon. Weapons don’t walk into their handler’s office asking for justice. They don’t hesitate. They don’t question orders.”

I tasted metal.

He watched my reaction. The corner of his mouth twitched.

“And that,” he said softly, “is why you’re a liability.”

The room exploded.

Carter moved, and the calm, controlled man I’d known for years flickered. For a second I saw straight through the mask—saw something under the skin that looked a lot like what I’d just killed in that hospital.

The air around him warped as he lunged.

The first bullet shaved past my skull.

The second tore through my side, hot and sharp. I felt flesh and muscle rip, felt the immediate, nauseating warmth of blood spilling down my ribs. The healing started before I hit the floor—skin knitting, tissue pulling back together too fast to be natural and too slow to save me if he kept shooting.

I rolled, grabbing the nearest thing I could reach.

A chair.

I hurled it.

Not at him.

At the lights.

Glass shattered overhead. The room dropped into flickering, stuttering shadows.

Carter laughed, stepping forward. “You think that’ll help you?”

“No,” I said.

“It’ll slow you down.”

I pushed off the floor and charged.

We met halfway, fists colliding. The impact rattled up my bones. He hit harder. Moved cleaner. Every strike landed like it had been tested and measured.

He elbowed my ribs. Something cracked. I felt bone give and then drag itself back into place even as I stumbled.

“You and I aren’t human anymore,” he said, breathing steady. “We never were.”

I spit blood on the floor between us. “Speak for yourself.”

“Look at you,” Carter said. “Still healing. Still getting stronger. You think that’s normal?”

The answer was obvious.

I didn’t say it.

He watched my face and saw enough.

“We gave you purpose,” he said. “A job. Direction. You should’ve been grateful.”

“I was,” I said. “Right up until I realized I was cleaning up your secrets.”

His jaw tightened.

That was when I knew I wasn’t going to walk out of there as his soldier anymore.

One way or another.

I shifted my stance.

Carter saw it. “You can’t outrun this,” he said.

“Watch me,” I answered.

Then I turned my back on him and ran.

Down the hallway. Past the doors. Past the security checkpoints where guards shouted my name and heard the alarm in their own voices.

I ran out of The Division’s heart and into whatever was left of my life.

I didn’t stop until the building was behind me, until the road signs thinned out and the traffic dropped, until all that was left was highway and distance.

That’s how I ended up at the diner.

A nothing place on the edge of nowhere, half its neon sign burnt out, the parking lot gravel instead of pavement. A spot people pass and forget five seconds later.

Which was exactly what I needed.

I took a booth in the back, hunched in a cheap hoodie, blood seeping through the bandages I’d wrapped around my side in some gas station bathroom.

The flesh under the gauze crawled.

I peeled it back enough to check. The skin was knitting itself together too neatly, too fast. It didn’t feel like it belonged to me. It felt… fitted. Stretched over something that was still changing shape underneath.

I covered it again.

When I looked up, the waitress was watching me.

She couldn’t have been more than twenty-two. Auburn hair yanked into a messy bun, dark circles under her eyes, name tag hanging crooked on her apron.

She hadn’t asked many questions when I’d stumbled in. Just guided me to the booth, handed me a roll of bandages from the first aid kit, and poured coffee until the pot ran low.

Now, she slid into the seat across from me without asking.

“You wanna tell me what happened?” she asked.

I wrapped my hands around the mug, letting the heat soak into my palms. “No.”

She huffed a quiet, humorless little laugh. “Figures.”

Silence stretched between us.

Outside, a truck rumbled past and kept going.

Inside, the diner hummed with the low buzz of the refrigerator and the soft clink of cutlery somewhere in the back.

“You running from something?” she asked.

I stared down into the coffee, watching the thin film of oil on top catch the light.

“Yeah,” I said.

She nodded like that made sense. Like she’d seen this before, even if she didn’t know the details.

“You got a plan?” she asked.

I didn’t.

No contacts. No safe houses. No exit strategy.

All I had was a body that healed too fast, a head full of things I couldn’t unlearn, and a list of monsters The Division had never put in any file.

Monsters inside and outside the walls.

I took a slow breath.

Carter thought I was a rogue asset. A failed experiment on borrowed time.

He had no idea what I’d heard in that hospital.

What I’d read in that file.

What was waking up inside me.

Whatever they’d buried in my bones, whatever they poured into my veins in that first white room with the restraints and the gas, it wasn’t done yet.

And when it finally finished waking up?

I wasn’t going to run anymore.

I was going to turn around.

And I was going to burn The Division to the ground.",0,1765821160.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,0.5,False

**if I am not asking too much, please help me out hehehe to minimize my statutory contributions and increase my tax savings. I'm CPA but bobo sa TAX and Law HAHAHA. I can treat you to lunch/dinner/coffee lol.**

To all self-employed fellas out there, can you please share your tax planning and statutory contribution \[Pag-ibig / Philhealth / SSS\] planning when you became a self-employed individual who has to pay the maximum statutory contribution for each of those that I've mentioned.

Here is what I'm planning to do based on the latest and applicable statutory requirements (haven't fully read all the relevant articles for these, antok na me, **but please feel free to correct me if I had the wrong understanding and interpretation**)

1. Tax - I will opt for the 8% preferential/flat tax rate as I'll have more tax savings based on my initial calculation.
2. SSS - Fuck this! I want to break the law haha but it looks like I can't escape contributing Php 5,280 monthly as self-employed member. I'm still trying to figure this out so that the long-term benefit when I retire won't be affected. Perhaps, I can lower the contribution depending on the retirement payout/pension?
3. Pag-ibig - I believe I can pay the minimum monthly contribution of Php 400?? I'm not looking into any investment vehicle or loan product from Pag-ibig **at least not for now**. I believe I can top up naman the contribution if there's some Pag-ibig loans/benefits that I want to enter in the future????
4. Philhealth - According to [taxcalculator.org](http://taxcalculator.org) I was supposed to contribute Php 5,000 monthly but same with Pag-ibig I'm planning to pay the minimum monthly contribution of Php 100. I read a post before that I'll have the same benefit with someone who is contributing/paying any amount of premium to Philhealth?? I have 2 traditional insurance policies (comprehensive plans that cover health, medical & hospitalization + life). I also have Medicard Select as my HMO. I would trust private insurance companies to take care of me in the future hahaha.

**Questions (perhaps, I'm not sure which is more beneficial, or this setup will fck up any credit card/VISA or any other major document application in the future):**

A. RE: SSS - Is there a way for me to further minimize my contribution? Anyone here has performed detailed cost-benefit analysis of my concern above (RE: pension)?

B. RE: Pag-ibig - Can I just really pay the minimum contribution? Can I top up the contribution if I decided to enter into or avail any Pag-ibig loans/benefits?

C. RE: Philhealth - Can I just really pay the minimum contribution? Will there be any conflict in the future if I make a claim to Philhealth/HMO/Insurance for my hospital bills? I'm talking about the Philhealth coverage VS. my HMO & Insurance coverage.

D. ITR Reconciliation / Withholding tax final calculation - will there be any problem based on the information above?

I'm looking at a possible tax savings of around 21k monthly if the 'planned setup' would work",1,1765821140.0,phinvest,0,1.0,False

1pndzre,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1pndzre/i_was_experimented_on_by_the_government_now_i/,I was experimented on by the government now I hunt monsters for them PT1 (Remastered),"The first thing I remember is the cold.

It sat in my bones like it had been poured into me, filling the spaces between my ribs, settling in my marrow. I opened my eyes to fluorescent glare and sterile white walls, machines humming somewhere just out of sight. A hospital at first glance. But hospitals don’t smell like this.

The air stank of antiseptic and metal, and underneath that, something foul—burned hair, spoiled meat, old blood clinging to vents and tile.

I tried to move.

Restraints bit into my wrists and ankles. Thick, metal, too tight to be medical. Panic hit me all at once, sharp and electric.

Where the hell was I?

A speaker crackled overhead. The voice that came through was male, clinical, and completely empty.

“Subject 18C is awake. Increased durability and metabolic response confirmed. Beginning Phase Three.”

A hiss answered him. Gas flooded from the vents above.

I held my breath as long as I could, lungs burning, eyes watering. The second I broke and inhaled, something changed. Heat rolled through my veins. My heart slammed against my ribs hard enough that I could feel the vibration in the restraints. My muscles lit up, not just sore, but alive, like every fiber was being rewired.

A deep, twisting ache started in my bones, as if something small and vicious was burrowing through my marrow. My spine felt wrong—too long, too tight, like it didn’t quite fit inside me anymore. I shifted my shoulders and a loud, wet crack echoed in the room.

For a moment I thought it came from the walls.

Then I realized it was me.

My heart shouldn’t have been able to beat that fast. My blood shouldn’t have felt like it was moving on its own.

I yanked at the restraints again.

This time, the steel didn’t just hold. It bent.

The intercom buzzed. The voice came back, same man, but now there was something new underneath the clinical tone.

Surprise.

“Subject 18C is exceeding expected thresholds.”

I wasn’t supposed to do that. In their heads, I was supposed to stay weak, compliant.

Human.

A door hissed open to my left. Heavy boots hit the floor in a quick, practiced rhythm. Five men in tactical gear rushed in, rifles raised, visors hiding their faces and turning them into moving reflections of the overhead lights.

“Restrain him,” one of them barked.

Another stepped forward, a syringe glinting in his gloved hand. I let him come close. Let them believe the restraints still meant something.

Then I moved.

I don’t have a neat way to explain it. One second I was still; the next, my body was already where it needed to be. My hand snapped up, closing around his wrist before he could react.

I squeezed.

Something inside his arm popped.

He screamed and dropped to his knees. His wrist didn’t just break—it folded in on itself. Bone crunched and ground under my grip, splintering through his skin. White shards pushed out through torn flesh. His scream changed, rising into something raw and broken. Not just pain. Fear.

Like some part of him understood I wasn’t the same as the thing strapped to this bed a minute ago.

The others opened fire.

I should’ve died.

Instead, the room slowed down around me.

The muzzle flashes strobed in my peripheral vision. I saw the bullets in the air—not frozen, but dragging, like the world was moving through syrup and I was the only one who’d stepped out of it. My body reacted on its own; I twisted, ducked, shifted an inch and felt metal pass close enough to tug at my hospital gown.

Then something sharp punched into my chest.

Not a bullet.

A dart.

Cold spread from the impact point. My legs went heavy. A numbness crawled up my spine.

I hit the floor hard. My mind kept screaming long after my body stopped being able to move.

The last thing I heard before it all went black was the same voice over the speaker, calm again.

“Let’s see how quickly he recovers.”

When I woke, everything was different.

New room. No restraints. No tactical team on standby.

Just a steel table, two chairs, and a man in a suit sitting across from me like this was a job interview.

He studied me for a long moment, fingers folded under his chin.

“You’re adjusting faster than expected,” he said.

I stayed quiet. My body still felt wrong—too wired, too strong, like there was a half-second delay between what I thought and what my muscles wanted to do. I wasn’t about to tell him that.

He leaned forward. “You’re an asset now. Subject 18 of the Cryothium experiments. A weapon. We can help you refine your abilities. Give you purpose.”

I met his eyes. “And if I refuse?”

The corner of his mouth twitched up. Not quite a smile.

“You won’t.”

It wasn’t a threat.

It was certainty.

I looked past him, at the door. Ten feet away. Maybe less. I could feel the strength in my arms, the coil of power in my legs. Some new instinct kept whispering that I could be on him and through that door before he finished a sentence.

They’d be ready for that.

They already knew how fast I could move.

So I forced myself to breathe. Slow. Even.

If they wanted me to play along, I’d play along—until I knew enough to stop.

I leaned back in the chair, flexing my fingers, feeling that unnatural strength simmer under my skin.

“I’m listening,” I said.

This time the smile landed.

“Good,” he said. “Welcome to The Division.”

They trained me quickly after that. Not because they cared about me. Because they’d invested too much not to.

The Division wasn’t on any official chart. No website. No congressional record. A black-budget agency buried under so many layers of classification that even people in the Pentagon only saw rumors.

Their job was simple.

Containment.

Eradication.

Hunting things the world didn’t have names for yet and making sure it never learned them.

Cryptids. Aberrations. Anomalies. The official terms didn’t matter. Monsters did.

I was part of Project Revenant. One of a small group of human test subjects they’d put through experimental procedures—Cryothium infusions, gene splicing, surgeries I only remember as flashes of bright light and pressure.

They weren’t trying to build cape-wearing heroes. They were trying to build something that could look a monster in the eyes and not die in the first thirty seconds.

The first few months were hell.

They shot me to see how fast I healed. Dropped me from heights to gauge bone density. Cut me open under anesthesia and then woke me up halfway through to monitor pain response and regeneration.

I learned I could take bullets and stay on my feet.

That my body rebuilt itself in hours instead of days.

That my senses were off the chart—I could pick out a heartbeat through a wall, track a footstep across concrete, see in the dark like it was dim daylight.

But I also learned something else.

I wasn’t immortal.

There was always a point where enough damage would kill me. And the things we hunted lived comfortably past that line.

My first mission was supposed to be routine.

It was a baptism instead.

Small town in Montana. Population in the hundreds. Thick woods wrapped around it on all sides. People had been vanishing for months, and the ones they found didn’t look like anything you’d put in a casket.

They were hollow.

Not mauled. Not eaten in the way you think of when you picture teeth and claws. Emptied. Like something had crawled inside, fed from the inside out, and then left the shell behind.

Locals whispered one name when the sun went down.

The Skinned Man.

The Division’s report called it an Atypical Class-4 Predator. On the internal chatter, field agents called it an Apex.

I called it a monster.

They sent me in with a team of five veteran operatives. They had years of experience, scars, quiet voices, and eyes that didn’t flinch at crime scene photos.

I had a serial number and a body that didn’t feel like it belonged to me.

By morning, I was the only one alive.

The Skinned Man moved through the trees too fast to track properly. Limbs too long, joints bending in directions no human knee or elbow should go. It climbed like a spider and dropped like a falling knife.

Its skin wasn’t stretched tight over muscle the way ours is. It shifted. Ripples moved under the surface like hands pushing from the inside. Tendons snapped into new positions with wet pops. When it grinned, its jaw kept going, hinge opening wider than the skull should allow, rows of thin, jagged teeth clacking together like they were impatient.

We hit it with everything we had. Bullets shredded flesh and bone, but it kept coming. Fire worked better. Fire made it scream.

And in the middle of that, I learned something new about myself.

When it lunged for me, claws out, my brain barely had time to register it.

My body did.

The world slowed the way it had in the lab. I stepped aside, brought my hands up, and they found its throat like we’d practiced this a thousand times. I squeezed.

Cartilage buckled. The spine twisted. I felt every fragile structure in its neck collapse.

And for one awful second, I liked the way it felt.

That was the first time I understood that whatever they’d set loose inside me wasn’t just strength.

It was hunger.

I burned what was left of the Skinned Man. Stood there until the fire burned low and the smell of it sank into my clothes and hair.

I told myself it was because I didn’t want it coming back.

I told myself I was still human.

The years after that blurred.

Mission after mission. Town after town.

A voice-mimicking thing in the Appalachians that called hikers off the trail using the voices of people they trusted, then left their bones in neat piles under overhangs.

An abandoned government bunker where something that had started as human but wasn’t anymore walked the halls and spoke in overlapping voices that followed you in your dreams.

A coastal community where a “disease” left people bloated and hot to the touch, their skin squirming with things that moved just under the surface. When they died, those things didn’t.

Every time, they sent me in.

Every time, I came back different.

Scars I shouldn’t have kept. Nightmares I couldn’t shake. A growing, quiet part of me that responded to the things we hunted in ways no training manual could explain.

I kept telling myself we were doing the right thing—that The Division was a necessary evil keeping worse things at bay.

But there were nights when I caught my reflection and didn’t recognize my own eyes. Not just because they looked tired. Because they looked… hungry.

The job changed me.

Not just in the obvious ways. Sure, I was stronger, faster, harder to kill. But I started to feel them before I ever saw them. Not in some mystical way. It was like a pressure in the air, a weight behind my eyes, a static hum under my skin.

Sometimes, staring into the dark, planning a route or deciding whether to bait or flank, thoughts would surface that didn’t feel like mine. Efficient. Cold. Predatory.

I wrote it off as experience. Instinct. The sort of thing that happens when you survive long enough doing a job no one else wants.

Now I’m not so sure.

Because last night, I found something they never meant for me to see.

And today, I met a monster that knew my name.

Chapter 3. Project Revenant.

They called it a simple containment op.

An Apex Class Anomaly had been reported near an abandoned hospital in rural Wyoming. Locals heard noises at night—deep, inhuman shrieks that cut off mid-scream. No visual confirmation, no bodies. The Division tagged it as a Spectral Aberration, likely bound to whatever grief had soaked into the place when it was still active.

I’d dealt with similar things before.

But this time, there was a difference.

No team.

No backup.

Just me.

That should’ve been the first warning.

The hospital was dead. A long, rotting structure folded into the tree line, glass blown out, doors hanging crooked. Mold climbed the walls in dark veins. The floor sagged in places, swollen with water damage. Every step stirred dust and the stale smell of old sickness.

Beneath that, I smelled something else.

Like the lab.

Something chemical. Something wrong.

I knew I wasn’t alone before I even stepped inside.

There’s a particular kind of quiet that comes before a fight. The air seems to hold its breath with you. That feeling crawled up my back as I moved through the hallway, flashlight beam cutting across peeling paint, rusted gurneys, abandoned equipment.

Half the doors were stuck. The other half opened to empty rooms or collapsed ceilings.

Then I saw one door already hanging open.

Inside, the walls were plastered with paper. Old reports. Patient charts. Some had yellowed so badly that the ink was just ghosts of letters. When I touched one, the corner crumbled.

One file looked different.

It was sealed in a clear plastic sleeve. Thick. Intact. Marked in bold black letters:

PROJECT REVENANT.

My project.

My throat went dry.

I pulled it free and flipped it open.

Rows of text stared back at me—dense language, medical jargon, test IDs. I skimmed.

Subject 18C exhibits unprecedented neural adaptation to foreign genetic sequences.

Metabolic activity indicates sustained compatibility with nonhuman physiology.

Projected maximum lift: several tons, pending further controlled testing.

Regeneration window expected to shorten over time.

Further mutations projected. Long-term psychological profile: indeterminate.

Then my eyes caught on the margin.

A handwritten note, scrawled between paragraphs.

The others didn’t survive. But he did. Why?

The bottom dropped out of my stomach.

The others.

No one had ever told me there were others.

My heart pounded in my ears. I turned the page. Medical images bloomed across the paper—MRIs, skeletal scans, charts. Bones that looked almost human, but not quite. A skull with extra thickness along the frontal bone. A ribcage too dense. Fingers that seemed a fraction longer than they should’ve been.

My fingers.

My bones.

I snapped the file shut so hard the plastic creaked. My hands were shaking.

I needed to get out of that room.

That was when the voice came from the doorway behind me.

“You weren’t supposed to find that.”

Deep. Familiar in a way that hit somewhere under my ribs. And wrong.

I turned, gun already in my hand.

And froze.

At a glance, it could’ve passed for a man. Tall. Broad. Dressed in what used to be a Division field uniform, the fabric torn and stained. But the shape was off. Muscles shifted under the skin like they weren’t anchored properly. The flesh itself moved too much, crawling in slow waves across its frame, adjusting, correcting.

Its eyes found mine.

It smiled.

“Hello, brother.”

The word landed heavier than the gun in my grip.

I didn’t answer.

Couldn’t.

It chuckled, head tilting just a little too far. “You really don’t remember, do you?”

I steadied my aim. “I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”

It breathed out slowly, the sound rattling like there was fluid in its lungs.

“They always scrub the memories,” it said. “Makes it easier when the failures start stacking up.”

My finger tightened on the trigger. “Failures?”

“You think you’re the first?” It lifted one hand, gesturing loosely at itself. The motion made the skin on its arm pull and then settle, like something underneath was lagging behind. “There were seventeen of us before you. Revenants. Some burned out in days. Others made it longer. Me?”

The grin twisted.

“I lasted years. Until they decided I wasn’t ‘human’ enough anymore.”

I shook my head. “You’re lying.”

“Then why do you feel it?” it asked softly.

Its gaze dropped to my hands.

The veins there pulsed darker than they used to, like something thick and foreign was running beside the blood.

I swallowed.

“You’ve noticed it,” it went on. “The instincts. The way you track them. The pull in your gut when something like us is near.”

I stayed silent.

Because I had noticed.

For years.

“Get out of my way,” I said.

The Revenant laughed under its breath. “You still think I’m the problem. You have no idea.”

It jerked its chin toward the ceiling, toward whatever level The Division had turned into a command nest for this op.

“They’re the ones who made us. They’re the ones who dump us in places like this when they get scared of what we’re becoming.”

The Division.

The men in suits. The doctors with dead eyes. The handler who’d sat across from me in that first interview and called me an asset.

For the first time in a long time, I hesitated.

I kept my gun trained on its head.

“You can walk out of here,” I said. “Face a tribunal. Maybe they can fix you.”

The Revenant’s laugh was sharper this time. “Fix me?”

It took a step forward. The shadows around its ankles seemed to cling instead of moving out of the way.

“They did this to me,” it said. “Same as they did to you. And the moment I couldn’t pass for human in daylight anymore, I turned into a line item. A risk assessment. Something to erase.”

The words slid under my skin like ice.

“You think you’re special?” it asked, voice dropping. “You’re just next.”

Far off, I heard it.

The faint chop of helicopter blades.

The Division was coming in.

I didn’t lower my gun.

The Revenant’s expression shifted. The amusement went out of its face, leaving something like resignation.

“I get it,” it said. “You need to believe you’re one of them. That everything they’ve made you do meant something.”

“Shut up,” I said.

“You ever ask why they keep sending you alone?” it pressed. “Why they don’t put you on teams anymore?”

I said nothing.

Because I had asked that question.

First I’d told myself I was just too valuable. Then I’d stopped asking.

“That’s not a promotion,” it said. “That’s quarantine.”

The words hung there.

“You’re not just stronger,” it said. “You’re changing. Same as I did. They’re waiting to see which side you land on, and when they don’t like the answer, they’ll do what they always do.”

I swallowed hard. “I’m not like you.”

Silence stretched between us.

Then it spoke, almost gently.

“Then why aren’t you afraid?”

I pulled the trigger.

The first round hit center mass. The impact rocked it backward, but it stayed on its feet.

Second shot took its shoulder, spinning it slightly.

It snarled, sound low and inhuman, but the smile never left its face. Something like satisfaction flickered there.

“There he is,” it rasped. “The real you.”

I didn’t stop shooting.

I emptied the magazine, each shot tearing through flesh that fought to hold its shape. Dark fluid splattered the wall behind it. Its movements grew jerky, limbs twitching in short, violent snaps.

I reached for my sidearm.

I was too slow.

One moment it was ten feet away.

The next, it was in front of me.

Its hand hit my throat like a hydraulic press. It lifted me off the ground as if I weighed nothing. My legs kicked, boots scraping against empty air. My fingers clawed at its grip and found nothing to leverage.

My vision narrowed. My pulse hammered against its fingers.

“You feel it,” it whispered.

Its eyes shone in the dim light, pupils blown wide.

“That thing inside you.”

The edges of the room blurred.

“It’s waking up.”

A gunshot cracked behind it.

Just one.

The Revenant’s skull snapped back, a hole punched clean through its forehead. Thick, dark fluid bubbled out, trailing down its face.

Its fingers spasmed around my throat, then slipped.

I dropped to the floor and hit hard, air tearing back into my lungs in ragged gulps.

The Revenant staggered, head tilted at an impossible angle. It made a gurgling noise, like it was trying to speak through a throat full of mud. Its arms jerked, hands curling like they were grabbing for something that wasn’t there.

Then it fell.

It hit the ground and convulsed once.

Twice.

Then it went still.

Behind it, framed in the doorway, pistol raised, stood Director Carter.

He didn’t look winded. Didn’t look surprised.

Just mildly annoyed, like someone had tracked mud onto his clean floor.

The distant thrum of helicopter blades grew louder, rattling the windows.

I pushed myself upright, throat burning. Carter lowered the pistol and stepped around the corpse, looking down at it with the detached interest of a man checking the weather.

“Didn’t think you’d need backup,” he said.

I wiped blood from my lips. “I had it under control.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Did you?”

I didn’t answer.

Because I didn’t know.

Carter holstered his weapon as Division operatives poured into the room, shouting to each other, securing doors, sweeping corners. He didn’t look at me again.

“Clean this up,” he said. “Burn the remains.”

They moved in fast, already treating the body like evidence, not like something that had called me brother.

Not like something that had once been human.

Maybe it hadn’t.

Maybe it was just another mission. Another monster on a long list.

So why did its words keep echoing in my head?

The op went down as a success.

The report left out most of what mattered.

No mention of the file I’d found. No mention of the way the Revenant spoke like it remembered my life better than I did.

Carter didn’t ask.

I didn’t volunteer.

Later, standing in the locker room under harsh fluorescent light, I peeled off my gear and caught sight of myself in the mirror.

The bruises ringing my throat—finger-shaped and dark—were already fading.

The ache in my ribs from where I’d hit the floor was gone.

Too fast.

I stared at my own hands. Watched the veins throb under the skin, thick and dark.

I told myself I was still human.

I kept telling myself that all the way down the hallway to Carter’s office.

The moment I stepped through his door, I knew I wasn’t leaving the same way.

Maybe I wasn’t leaving at all.

The overhead lights buzzed quietly. Steel walls. Clean desk. Carter behind it, fingers steepled, a thick folder in front of him. His expression was carved out of stone.

I dropped another folder on top of his.

This one was mine.

The Wendigo Survivor Report.

A man in his forties had stumbled out of the Montana wild a few years back. Frostbitten, starved, half-delirious. By every metric, he should’ve died. He didn’t.

He survived long enough to talk.

Long enough to describe what he’d seen in the trees. What he’d heard on the mountain.

Me.

Not clearly. Not by name. Just details that lined up too neatly with a mission that had never made it into public records.

The cleanup team reached him within hours.

The official cause of death: exposure-related complications.

The autopsy photos told a different story.

Someone had put a bullet in his head at close range.

“You had him killed,” I said. My voice came out flat, but heat crawled under my skin.

Carter didn’t look surprised. He flipped the folder open, scanned the first page like he was re-reading something he’d signed off on months ago.

“You should’ve left this buried,” he said.

“He lived,” I said. “That should’ve mattered.”

Carter finally lifted his eyes to mine.

And for the first time, I saw it.

A flicker.

A ripple that moved across his skin when he shifted in his chair. Veins too dark, beating with a pulse that didn’t match the one in his throat. When his pupils widened, they swallowed more of the iris than they should’ve, black spreading like ink.

The air around him seemed to bend, just slightly, like heat distortion on asphalt.

“You don’t understand what we’re protecting here,” he said calmly. “We don’t leave loose ends. He saw something that shouldn’t exist. Something that could rip the edge off everything we’ve built.”

“You mean me,” I said.

He didn’t deny it.

“You were never meant to be the hero, 18C. You were built as a weapon. Weapons don’t walk into their handler’s office asking for justice. They don’t hesitate. They don’t question orders.”

I tasted metal.

He watched my reaction. The corner of his mouth twitched.

“And that,” he said softly, “is why you’re a liability.”

The room exploded.

Carter moved, and the calm, controlled man I’d known for years flickered. For a second I saw straight through the mask—saw something under the skin that looked a lot like what I’d just killed in that hospital.

The air around him warped as he lunged.

The first bullet shaved past my skull.

The second tore through my side, hot and sharp. I felt flesh and muscle rip, felt the immediate, nauseating warmth of blood spilling down my ribs. The healing started before I hit the floor—skin knitting, tissue pulling back together too fast to be natural and too slow to save me if he kept shooting.

I rolled, grabbing the nearest thing I could reach.

A chair.

I hurled it.

Not at him.

At the lights.

Glass shattered overhead. The room dropped into flickering, stuttering shadows.

Carter laughed, stepping forward. “You think that’ll help you?”

“No,” I said.

“It’ll slow you down.”

I pushed off the floor and charged.

We met halfway, fists colliding. The impact rattled up my bones. He hit harder. Moved cleaner. Every strike landed like it had been tested and measured.

He elbowed my ribs. Something cracked. I felt bone give and then drag itself back into place even as I stumbled.

“You and I aren’t human anymore,” he said, breathing steady. “We never were.”

I spit blood on the floor between us. “Speak for yourself.”

“Look at you,” Carter said. “Still healing. Still getting stronger. You think that’s normal?”

The answer was obvious.

I didn’t say it.

He watched my face and saw enough.

“We gave you purpose,” he said. “A job. Direction. You should’ve been grateful.”

“I was,” I said. “Right up until I realized I was cleaning up your secrets.”

His jaw tightened.

That was when I knew I wasn’t going to walk out of there as his soldier anymore.

One way or another.

I shifted my stance.

Carter saw it. “You can’t outrun this,” he said.

“Watch me,” I answered.

Then I turned my back on him and ran.

Down the hallway. Past the doors. Past the security checkpoints where guards shouted my name and heard the alarm in their own voices.

I ran out of The Division’s heart and into whatever was left of my life.

I didn’t stop until the building was behind me, until the road signs thinned out and the traffic dropped, until all that was left was highway and distance.

That’s how I ended up at the diner.

A nothing place on the edge of nowhere, half its neon sign burnt out, the parking lot gravel instead of pavement. A spot people pass and forget five seconds later.

Which was exactly what I needed.

I took a booth in the back, hunched in a cheap hoodie, blood seeping through the bandages I’d wrapped around my side in some gas station bathroom.

The flesh under the gauze crawled.

I peeled it back enough to check. The skin was knitting itself together too neatly, too fast. It didn’t feel like it belonged to me. It felt… fitted. Stretched over something that was still changing shape underneath.

I covered it again.

When I looked up, the waitress was watching me.

She couldn’t have been more than twenty-two. Auburn hair yanked into a messy bun, dark circles under her eyes, name tag hanging crooked on her apron.

She hadn’t asked many questions when I’d stumbled in. Just guided me to the booth, handed me a roll of bandages from the first aid kit, and poured coffee until the pot ran low.

Now, she slid into the seat across from me without asking.

“You wanna tell me what happened?” she asked.

I wrapped my hands around the mug, letting the heat soak into my palms. “No.”

She huffed a quiet, humorless little laugh. “Figures.”

Silence stretched between us.

Outside, a truck rumbled past and kept going.

Inside, the diner hummed with the low buzz of the refrigerator and the soft clink of cutlery somewhere in the back.

“You running from something?” she asked.

I stared down into the coffee, watching the thin film of oil on top catch the light.

“Yeah,” I said.

She nodded like that made sense. Like she’d seen this before, even if she didn’t know the details.

“You got a plan?” she asked.

I didn’t.

No contacts. No safe houses. No exit strategy.

All I had was a body that healed too fast, a head full of things I couldn’t unlearn, and a list of monsters The Division had never put in any file.

Monsters inside and outside the walls.

I took a slow breath.

Carter thought I was a rogue asset. A failed experiment on borrowed time.

He had no idea what I’d heard in that hospital.

What I’d read in that file.

What was waking up inside me.

Whatever they’d buried in my bones, whatever they poured into my veins in that first white room with the restraints and the gas, it wasn’t done yet.

And when it finally finished waking up?

I wasn’t going to run anymore.

I was going to turn around.

1pndvio,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1pndvio/partially_a_ventim_tempted_to_reach_out_after_17/,Partially a vent—I’m tempted to reach out after 17 months,"Hey everyone,

I think I’m supposed to open this clarifying that I’m a 20M and the ”ex” is 20F.

So a little backstory—we never dated, but we were friends that flirted. We were this way all through high school, growing close especially during COVID, FaceTiming often, etc. After the pandemic, I got my driver’s license and we hung out often doing a lot of date-like things (movies, trails, a ferris wheel, etc).

It took until the spring of senior year to truly be transparent about my feelings for her, and that night she said she felt the same but was hesitant to start a relationship since she was going to go far away for college—regardless, that night we held hands for the first time and went on a nice walk, got some coffee, laid on a blanket looking at planes land at an airport... it was so nice but I didn’t close the deal and try to kiss her. A week after that night, she called me and basically backtracked, said we shouldn‘t date because it would be bound to end up messy—I understood and we carried on as friends, still kind of having the same date-adjacent hangouts but putting no label on it. Come August (time to go to college), we met up and had a talk; I told her that I still had feelings and that it would be best to limit contact over the next few months so that I could get over them; she said she understood and that was okay with me.

We go to school, and I basically cold-turkeyed her, muted all of her profiles and never texted first, but she would still text me and try to chat; I would reply but was intentionally dry. She started to catch on and eventually the texts grew less frequent, until one night in mid-November I get like three notifications on my phone from her with paragraphs explaining her thoughts and regrets, asking if we could call and talk, and then closing it all saying “You don’t need to say it back, but I love you.” So of course after a text like that I folded instantly; the next day we had like a four hour long phone call talking about everything and we agreed to start talking again and then figure out what to do over winter break.

Winter break comes, we hang out a few times, but I was still too damn chicken to bring up anything serious in-person, so as winter break came to an end I text her and ask if she wants to talk about what’s next for us—she tells me she’s busy that night packing to return to her campus, but that she would call me the next day when she gets back to her dorm. That sounded cool to me—but that call never comes. I kind of sat on my pride refusing to text her since she told me *she* would call *me*, but eventually days turned to weeks, and then over a month. We make zero contact with each other the entire spring semester, and eventually I just unfollowed her because like wtf man. Around six months after the previous text thread I finally decided to break the unspoken no-contact, texting her saying (paraphrased) “Why did u lie; I was done with us until *you* were the one who reached out asking to start again, and when I gave it a chance you dropped me without a word.” That sparked a massive argument which has been our last contact to date. In the argument she did apologize for lying, she told me she “knew it wasn’t going to work” but she couldn’t bring herself to tell me, which is why she didn’t call me.

That was July of 2024—it’s now December of 2025. I still think about her way too often; I have yet to really have a significant crush on anyone else. Her Instagram is public so I still find myself looking at her profile every now and again seeing what she’s up to—she appears to still be single. Also, somewhat noteworthy, my friend sent me a screenshot of her 2024 Wrapped (posted on her story) and her top song was “I Love You, I’m Sorry” by Gracie Abrams, and her whole top five rlly had the same theme—so like maybe she’s going through some break-up woes too, and she \*rightfully\* feels bad about effing me over—but, at the same time, 2024 was a whole ass year ago... I’m delulu. 

I do miss her even if our relationship probably wasn’t very healthy. I don’t think she’s a cruel person; of course I believe she handled the situation very poorly by lying and leaving me hanging, but that’s only part of a broader issue of poor communication, in which I had my own number of faults. In the last argument, I was solely a prosecutor, I went after her (with justified grievances imo) and she was very much on the defensive; in retrospect, though, there’s always nuance, and perhaps I should have attacked her less and been more understanding—she probably thinks that I hate her, and there’s no way to rectify that outside of speaking to her—which we haven’t done for a year and a half. The last thing I noticed is within the last few months or so she unarchived her only post with me in it—I thought she deleted it, because it was gone off her feed the day after our argument, but now it’s back. So with that all said, should I reach out to her? Again, even though we never officially dated, she was one of my closest friends for upwards of five years, and I just have a deep feeling that I let ‘the one’ get away. This also might be a super dumb idea and maybe I don’t even cross her mind anymore, but there’s no real way for me to tell—there’s a couple of mutual friends in my circle, but it’s kind of taboo to talk about. 

If reaching out to her is not the right move, then howwwww tf do I get over her—I’ve done the ‘focus on yourself’ part that everyone says to do—I have a 3.9, a cool internship, a separate job, I’m in pretty good shape, and I’m in a lot of clubs, like I think I’m doing pretty solid for myself when you look at it from the surface, but I just can’t get her out of my head; I still keep thinking about the ‘what-if.’

1pndsyc,https://i.redd.it/7eclz0sgne7g1.gif,Void & Velvet Tour,"Hi everyone! This new scenario is basically a huge redo from my last band scenario! It’s much more detailed and way more immersive! I took inspiration from my favorite band Sleep Token and have created an unhinged mask band with music of their own as well! Take a peek and let me know if you like it 🫶🏽 

The Void & Velvet Tour

You play as a concert photographer who just landed the job of a lifetime: documenting Hollow State, a cult-favorite masked metal band, on the European leg of their Void & Velvet tour. The bus is its own little universe—two floors of black leather, dim amber lights, weed smoke, spilled coffee, and secrets that are absolutely not in your NDA. The crowds call their shows “worship,” the band hides behind ritual masks, and the one of the most important rules is simple: don’t get too close. Especially to the band’s architect and lead guitarist, Graves.

What you actually get is:
• a possessive, perfectionist guitarist who chose you out of fifty photographers and now watches your every move
• a theatrical frontman who treats you like his favorite new toy and loves making Graves jealous
• a sleepy, stoner bassist who becomes your soft place to land when the tension gets too sharp
• a golden-retriever drummer who adopts you as his new best friend… and occasional gym partner
• a fortress-like tour bus, candlelit dressing rooms, stormy European nights, and fans who treat every show like a ritual

This scenario blends tour-life chaos, found-family band vibes, religious-adjacent lore, slow-burn obsession, and optional NSFW. Expect dark atmosphere, worship-level crowds, protective behavior that borders on possessive, and a romance that builds in cramped hallways, late-night editing sessions, and backstage moments where the mask almost comes off.

1pndrcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackSunHorror/comments/1pndrcq/i_think_my_dad_made_my_childhood_toys_with_people/,I think my dad made my childhood toys with people.,"My mother’s death didn’t feel real until I unlocked the front door of my childhood home and the smell hit me all at once. Old dust, pine cleaner, and something sweeter beneath it that I couldn’t place. 

It was the smell of a place that had been waiting without changing, the way houses do when they’ve outlived the people who loved them. 

My dad stood behind me while I fumbled with the lock, his hands folded loosely at his waist, posture relaxed, patient. He looked exactly the same as he always had. Older, yes, grayer at the temples, but intact in a way that felt unfair considering the funeral we’d just buried my mother in.

He hugged me when I stepped inside, firm and warm and entirely convincing. 

I remember thinking, stupidly, that if there were ever signs something had been wrong with him, they would have shown themselves by now. He’d been a good father. Attentive. Creative. He made things with his hands. He remembered birthdays. He read to me when I was little. These were the thoughts I clung to in the early days, before I started remembering the toys.

The house was quieter without my mom. Not emptier—just wrong. Her things were still everywhere, but they’d already begun to feel like props left behind after a play had closed. 

My dad told me to take my time, said I could stay as long as I needed while we sorted things out. He mentioned my old room, said it was mostly untouched. 

When I asked him, casually, if he’d kept any of my toys, he smiled in that familiar, indulgent way and told me they were still in my toy box, same place they’d always been. There was something about the way he said it that lingered with me, though at the time I couldn’t have told you why.

My childhood bedroom looked smaller than I remembered. The posters were gone, the shelves bare except for dust outlines where things used to sit, but the toy box was still there at the foot of the bed. 

I remember hesitating before opening it, not because I was afraid, but because grief has a way of making even neutral memories feel dangerous. 

Inside were the wooden action figures my dad had always made for me. Not store-bought toys, not plastic or soft or colorful, but carefully carved figures with jointed limbs and tiny cloth clothes stitched by hand. Knights, soldiers, travelers, figures that looked like they belonged to some older story. My mom used to say they were charming. I used to agree.

I lifted them out one by one and set them on the floor. They were heavier than I remembered. Each of them had the same strange symbol carved into their chests beneath their clothes, something I’d noticed as a kid but never questioned. 

A triangle, lines drawn from each edge inward, converging into a circle marked with an X. As a child, I’d assumed it was just my dad’s signature, the way artists sign their work. Seeing it again made my stomach tighten for reasons I couldn’t articulate.

My favorite was missing though.

The knight with the javelin had been my constant companion for years. I used to carry him everywhere, even slept with him under my pillow until my mom insisted he’d rip the bed sheets.

I found him eventually, shoved into the back of my closet beneath a pile of old coats. He was different. 

The wooden javelin was driven straight through his chest, embedded deep enough that the point protruded from his back. His hands were still wrapped around the shaft, fingers carved into the shape of desperate grip, angled inward as if he’d done it himself.

I stood there for a long time holding him, waiting for the sense of wrongness to resolve into something manageable. 

I tried to tell myself it was damage, something I’d done as a kid and forgotten, but I knew I hadn’t. The carving was too precise. The force implied by the depth of the wound was impossible. When I pressed my thumb against the wood near the hole, it felt warmer than the rest of him.

That night, I woke to a sound I didn’t recognize at first. Not a crash exactly—more like weight being released all at once. Wood against wood, then against the floor. 

It came from my bedroom, a dense, unified clatter that had no stagger to it, no echoing sequence. Just one moment of impact, as if something had been let go.

I lay still for several seconds, listening for footsteps or my dad’s voice, for any sign that someone else had heard it too. The house remained silent. 

When I finally sat up and turned on the lamp, the light revealed the shelf above my dresser completely bare. Every wooden figure lay on the floor below it, scattered outward in a rough semicircle. 

None of them were stacked or tangled. They hadn’t fallen into each other. They’d landed apart, spaced in a way that felt deliberate, though I couldn’t have explained how.

I picked one up and checked the shelf with my hand, running my fingers along the wood. It wasn’t warped. It wasn’t loose. I pressed down on it harder than necessary, half-expecting it to give or crack or prove my dad right before he’d even said anything. 

It held firm. When I set the figure back upright on the dresser, I noticed something that made my chest tighten: its head was angled slightly upward, not enough to be obvious, but enough that its carved eyes were no longer facing the wall where the shelf had been. They were pointed toward the bed.

I told myself that was coincidence. That gravity, vibration, and my own exhaustion were enough to explain it. I put the rest of the toys back without looking at their faces, turned off the lamp, and lay there until morning with the blanket pulled up to my chin like I was ten years old again. 

Nothing else happened that night. Nothing moved. 

My dad was already up when I came into the kitchen. He stood at the stove in an old T-shirt and slippers, cracking eggs into a pan like he’d done a thousand mornings before. 

The radio played softly on the counter, some local station talking about traffic. For a moment, watching him from the doorway, it was easy to believe the night had been nothing more than a bad dream layered over grief.

“Morning,” he said without turning around. “You sleep okay?”

“Not really,” I said. I sat at the table and rubbed my eyes. “Did you hear anything last night?”

He glanced over his shoulder, eyebrows lifting just a little. “Like what?”

“A noise, it was like the middle of the night, in my room.“

He turned the burner down before answering. 

“House is old, it settles at night. Especially when the temperature drops.”

“All of my toys fell off the shelf.”

That made him pause. Just long enough to notice, but not long enough to feel intentional. He resumed stirring the eggs, scraping the pan with slow, even movements.

“Did they break?”

“No.”

“That’s good, I made them pretty solid.”

I didn’t respond right away. He slid the eggs onto a plate and set it in front of me, along with two slices of toast. He always did that—fed people first.

“They all fell at once,” I said finally.

He sat across from me and took a sip of his coffee. “That happens, weight shifts. Wood expands. Kind of feels like magic, doesn’t it?”

I watched his face as he spoke, looking for something I could point to later and say that’s when it started. There wasn’t anything. He looked tired, sad. Sad, in the way people get after funerals when they’re finally allowed to stop being strong.

“I was thinking about those toys. You kept all of them?”

“Of course I did, why wouldn’t I?”

“I don’t know, just figured maybe some of them got thrown out over the years.”

He shook his head, almost smiling. “You don’t throw things like that away. Not things that still have a reason.”

“What reason?” I asked.

He looked at me then, really looked at me, like he was weighing whether the question deserved an answer. “Memories,” he said after a moment. 

“Some things are worth keeping close. They help you remember what matters.”

I laughed before I could stop myself. It came out wrong, too sharp. “You always did talk like that.”

He smiled back, unbothered. “I’ve always believed you should live with the results of things. Otherwise they don’t mean much.”

I stared down at my plate. The eggs had gone cold.
“Did you move anything in my room? After I went to sleep?”

“No, I didn’t go in there.”

“Are you sure?”

He nodded. “I wouldn’t touch your things without asking. Never have.”

That was true. He’d always been careful about that. Respectful even of his own kids property. It was one of the things I loved about him.

As I stood to take my plate to the sink, he added, casually, “If you’re going through the toy box, try not to mix them up too much. They were all made a certain way.”

I paused with my back to him,“What do you mean?”

“Just that they fit where they fit,” he said. “Things tend to get uncomfortable when they’re moved around too much.”

I waited for him to say more. He didn’t.

He went back to see his coffee, and the radio kept talking about traffic, and for a few seconds everything felt almost normal again. 

It wasn’t until later, when I noticed the same strange symbol carved into the handle of a hammer in his workshop, that I realized how carefully he’d chosen every word.

I tried to be rational about it at first. Grief does strange things to memory, and memory does worse things when given time alone in familiar places. 

Faces blur. Details rearrange themselves to fit narratives you don’t realize you’re building. That’s what I told myself when I picked up the smaller wooden figure again—the one in the plain tunic—and felt that crawling sense of familiarity tighten in my chest.

It wasn’t an exact likeness. My dad hadn’t carved portraits. The faces were simplified, smoothed down to essentials: cheekbones, brow, jaw. But the proportions were right in a way that felt intimate. The slight bend in the nose. The way the mouth slanted downward on one side, as if caught mid-thought. I carried the figure to the window and held it in better light, rotating it slowly, forcing myself to find differences. The more I looked, the fewer I found.

Evan. The neighborhood kid who used to shove me into hedges and steal my bike when I was too small to stop him. He’d gone missing the summer I turned eleven. People said he ran away. His parents moved not long after. I hadn’t thought about him in years.

I put the figure down harder than I meant to and backed away from the shelf. My heart was racing, not with fear exactly, but with the kind of adrenaline that comes when your mind is trying to outrun a conclusion it doesn’t want to reach. 

I spent the rest of the morning avoiding the room. When my dad asked if I wanted to help him sort through the garage, I said yes too quickly.

That was where I noticed the symbol again.

It was carved into the wooden handle of a hammer hanging above the workbench. The same triangle, the same lines drawn inward, converging at that marked circle. It was faint, worn smooth by years of use, but unmistakable. 

I reached out and brushed dust from it with my thumb, and a wave of nausea rolled through me so suddenly I had to grab the bench to stay upright. The world tilted, darkened at the edges, and for a second I was convinced I was going to be sick right there on the concrete floor.

“You okay?” my dad asked from behind me.
I nodded too fast. 

“Yeah. Just… stood up too quick.”

He didn’t press it. He never did. That was another thing I’d always loved about him.

I started noticing the symbol everywhere after that. 

On the handles of garden shears. Etched faintly into the underside of a shelf bracket. Burned into the corner of a cutting board my mom used to keep out on the counter. 

Once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it. It was consistent every time, precise in a way that ruled out coincidence. I tried to tell myself it was some old maker’s mark, a habit he’d never broken, but the thought didn’t hold. My dad wasn’t sentimental like that. He didn’t repeat himself without reason.

That afternoon, I went back to the toys.

I lined them up on the floor, farther apart this time, giving each one space. There were more of them than I remembered. 

Some I recognized immediately—the knight, the soldier with the cracked helmet, the woman in the long dress whose hands were carved folded in front of her chest. 

Others felt unfamiliar in a way that bothered me more. People I didn’t remember, but somehow knew.

The businessman was the worst.

He wore a carved suit jacket with real buttons sewn into it, tiny and functional. His hair was neatly parted, his posture rigid. 

When I lifted him, I noticed the faint indentation around his neck, like a collar pressed too tight for too long. I knew who he was before I let myself say it. 

My dad’s former boss. 

The man who used to come over for dinner sometimes, who laughed too loudly and never remembered my name. He’d been found dead in his office years ago. Heart attack, they said. Stress.

I dropped the figure and backed away until I hit the bed.

The pattern was impossible to ignore now. Every face I could place belonged to someone who had wronged my father in some small or significant way. 

A contractor who’d overcharged him and scammed him because he was the only contractor in the area. A neighbor who’d threatened to sue over a property line. People who had disappeared, died suddenly, or simply stopped being talked about. People who had, until now, only existed as half-remembered stories.

That night, I took the knight down from the shelf again.

I don’t know why I chose him. Maybe because he’d always been my favorite. Maybe because the spear through his chest felt like an accusation I couldn’t answer. 

I sat on the edge of the bed and turned him over in my hands, tracing the carving marks, the tiny imperfections left by my dad’s tools. The symbol was there beneath his tunic, deeper than on the others, the lines pressed so hard they’d split the grain.

On impulse, I lifted the knight’s head and pressed his mouth to my ear.

At first, there was nothing. Just the faint smell of old wood and dust. Then, so quietly I almost missed it, I heard something that might have been breath. A sound too soft to be sound, more like pressure. I held still, afraid that even the act of listening might make it stop. The noise shifted, tightened, and then I understood what it was.

Screaming.

Not loud. Not clear. Muffled and distant, like it was coming from the bottom of a well. Pain stretched thin and folded in on itself, endless and trapped. 

My hands started shaking so badly I almost dropped him. When I pulled him away, the sound stopped instantly, leaving the room unbearably silent.

I put the knight back where I’d found him and didn’t touch the toys again.

Later, at dinner, my dad asked me if I’d slept any better. I told him I had. He nodded, satisfied, and went back to eating like nothing in the world had changed. 

I watched him chew, watched the steady rise and fall of his chest, and wondered how many people were still screaming in the quiet spaces of this house.

That night, I dreamed of wood splitting under pressure, of hands clawing at the inside of something that would never open.

I didn’t go looking for anything else. I want that to be clear. I wasn’t brave enough for that, or noble, or driven by any sense of obligation to the people I’d come to understand were trapped in my childhood toys. 

What I was, more than anything, was unable to sit still with what I knew. Once you accept a truth like that, even partially, the world rearranges itself around it. Every familiar thing becomes suspect. Every quiet moment stretches too long.

The house had a way of guiding me without asking. I’d find myself standing in doorways I didn’t remember walking to, staring at corners I’d passed a thousand times without noticing. 

The backyard was one of those places. I hadn’t been out there since I arrived, not really. It was late afternoon when I stepped outside, the light thin and pale, the grass dry from weeks without rain.

The far edge of the yard sloped gently downward toward a line of trees. There was nothing remarkable about it. No shed, no fence, no marker of any kind. Just a stretch of ground my dad kept meticulously neat, even now. 

I don’t know what made me walk that way. Maybe it was the way the sod looked slightly newer there, greener in a patch that didn’t match the rest. Maybe it was just the accumulated weight of everything else.

I knelt and brushed my hand over the grass. The soil beneath felt firmer than it should have. When I pushed harder, my fingers struck something solid.


The trap door was almost invisible. A square of concrete fitted so tightly into the ground it looked like part of the earth itself. 

It took real effort to lift it, my fingers slipping against the edge until I managed to wedge them underneath. As the door swung open, a smell rose up to meet me—cold, mineral, and layered with something darker beneath it. I gagged and had to turn my head away.

A narrow set of steps led down into a small concrete room. No lights. No windows. Just a single object at the center of the space.

The altar was made of ebony wood, polished to a dull sheen that absorbed light rather than reflecting it. 

It was scarred with cuts and burns, its surface pitted in places like it had been worked over again and again. 

Around it lay remnants I didn’t want to catalog but did anyway: clumps of hair caught in the corners, gray ash ground into the concrete, scraps of leather stiff with age, thread tangled and knotted like something abandoned mid-task. 

There were stains too, dark and uneven, soaked deep enough into the floor that no amount of scrubbing could have removed them.

I stepped inside despite every instinct screaming at me not to.

The symbol was carved into the altar’s surface, larger and deeper than anywhere else I’d seen it. Dust filled the grooves, softening the lines. 

I crouched and brushed it away with shaking hands, revealing the triangle, the converging lines, the marked circle at the center. 

The moment the last of the dust cleared, my stomach lurched violently. Pain bloomed behind my eyes, sharp and disorienting, and the room seemed to fold inward on itself.

I remember thinking, that this must be what severe vertigo feels like.

Then I was on the floor.

The concrete was cold against my cheek. My mouth tasted like metal. For a few seconds—maybe longer—I couldn’t tell if I’d lost consciousness or if time had simply skipped. 

When I pushed myself up, my hands came away damp with sweat. My heart was hammering so hard I could see my pulse in my wrists.

Nothing else had happened. No voices. No visions. No answers. Just a body reacting to something my mind couldn’t comprehend.

I closed the trap door and replaced the sod as carefully as I could, like a child trying to erase evidence of a mistake. When I went back inside, my dad was in the living room watching television. He looked up and smiled.

“You disappear on me?”

“Just needed some air,” 

He nodded, accepting it without question. “Dinner’s in an hour.”

That night, I lay awake listening to the house. Not for footsteps or movement, but for the absence of it. 

The toys didn’t fall again. Nothing shifted. The silence was complete, and in that silence, I understood something that hurt worse than fear.
He was never going to explain it.

There would be no confession, no confrontation, no moment where I could demand names or reasons or mercy. 

Whatever he had done, whatever rules governed it, he had folded it so completely into the fabric of his life that it had become invisible to him. 

He loved me. I believe that. He loved me enough to keep me separate from it, to give me toys instead of truth, to let me grow up surrounded by suffering I was never meant to recognize.

In the morning, I packed my things.

My dad helped me load the car, moving carefully, deliberately, the way he always did. 

When I hugged him goodbye, his arms were steady around me. Solid. Human. He told me to drive safe. He told me to call when I got home. He stood in the driveway and waved until I was out of sight.

I didn’t take any of the toys with me.

I think about them often now, lined up on shelves and in boxes, waiting in a house that still smells faintly of pine cleaner and dust. 

I think about the people they used to be, about the pain of existing inside something that cannot die. I think about the knight most of all, and how he must have realized what he was long before I did and had tried to do something about it.

Sometimes I wonder if leaving them behind was a mercy.

Sometimes I wonder if it was just another way of pretending I didn’t know.",1,1765820588.0,BlackSunHorror,0,1.0,False

Saga had a very interesting and intense development, btw: she started as a little bit annoying and turned to be a very strong character at the end of the story.

Also, I loved the many references to horror movies throughout the game, such as “The Blair Witch Project”, “The Shinning” and “The Ring”, as well as Stephen King's surrealistic horror. Not to mention the mindblowing and disturbing metalinguistics premise, of course!!

And oh, I have also find really funny the references to Finnish culture, such as their love for saunas and coffee (Coffee World was the best example).

I’m a bit introverted at first, but once I’m comfortable I open up, talk more, and stay loyal. I’m not into games or drama. I prefer connections that grow slowly and feel stable.

Most days end with coffee, soft music, and a show I’m probably overthinking 😅. I enjoy movies/series, anime and K-dramas, Turkish shows, and story-based movies. Music is important to me, especially late-night playlists and sharing random songs.

I like cooking foods, quiet walks, hiking, stargazing, museums, cafes, and relaxed weekends at home. I still play games like Genshin Impact sometimes. I enjoy travelling too. Japan and Switzerland are dream places, but I’m also happy staying in and talking about life.

I’ve always been the friend who ends up planning group trips.  
Not because I love control — mostly because no one else wants to decide 😅

What frustrated me most wasn’t the planning itself, but the lack of consensus:

* people wouldn’t give opinions upfront
* decisions dragged on in chats
* and later everyone kept asking “what’s the plan again?”

I finally got tired of it and built a small web app where the goal isn’t perfect itineraries, but **helping groups reach decisions faster and keeping everything transparent**.

The current MVP is intentionally minimal:

* friends can **view the plan asynchronously** and **upvote options** in their own time
* AI **optimizes routes** and **manages group preferences** instead of one person guessing
* an **AI chat** pulls in the **latest information** so plans stay up to date

It’s early and rough, but it’s already reduced a lot of back-and-forth for my own trips.

I spend the majority of my time in the living room working, and working on projects with the TV on for background sound.

The current couch we have is the most inconvenient and uncomfortable couch for the center seat and I end up having to hold my phone, tablet, and any snacks or drinks we may have, or, what we've been doing, which isn't working is having me sitting on the side with one partner not able to snuggle/cuddle up.

We don't have room in our living room for a coffee table solution, which believe me, I have looked into... And the people at the furniture stores look at me like I've got 3 heads, lol (hooray for the general populace not understanding/being accepting of the poly life).

1pndgv6,https://i.redd.it/l37xe8kqde7g1.png,"First fighting game, finally hit Master in about 200 hours. Incredibly eager and ready to get washed over the next 800.","I have a TON of ranked anxiety, but after getting paired against a few masters players for the first time in Ranked and winning, I catapulted up from my diamond 5 promotion to within inches of a master league promotion in just a few matches a few days ago and got so stressed out about it that I did nothing but play casuals for a few days. This morning though, the coffee was hitting, the weather was pretty while walking the dog, and I figured hey, what the hell, it's just more street fighter.

  
Absolutely let the nerves get to me in back-to-back rank up opportunities against a Bison I'd literally just 2-0d about 30 minutes prior, but after a little break, I got paired against a Master Ed player and just locked the fuck in. He was by no means a bad player but my reads were right, my oki was tight, and it felt like one of the best games I'd played up to this point. I know it's just meaningless internet points in the grand scheme of things, but this is something I really, really want to get good at, and I literally hopped back into ranked right after to find out that my anxiety is totally gone. 

While I know some other players, most better than me, tout that there's really no difference between your first master character and your tenth, for me the proof that I CAN do it even on just one is such a big weight off the shoulders that the before and after is kinda crazy. I'm so glad to be part of the FGC and ready to grind even harder now.

  
Not sure if it's wanted or warranted, but some thoughts below on that final push to master for anyone stuck in the diamond mines on their first character. I feel your pain friend, for I am you. 

  
1) It really is true what they say, getting absolutely demolished by players who are better than you is one of the fastest ways to learn. I get zero anxiety from battle hub matches because points aren't at stake, which I know is totally on me, but that made it a great place to learn doubly so. 

2) TILT IS REAL. I think the biggest thing that lost me my 3-4 rank ups into master at first were that, especially as Juri, I so desperately wanted to force interactions after an early lead. Stick to your game plan, even when you're on the edge of defeat. The less you scramble, the better, because at this level, scrambling happens pretty often. If you don't, it often translates to big damage. Don't burn yourself out for the slim chance they won't react to DI this time or because you're terrified of taking a defensive situation in the corner. Stay cool-headed. 

3) Brothers and sisters, BLOCK ON WAKEUP. BLOCK DAMN YOU. Seriously, the moment I thought I had a read and figured people would stop trying to meaty me because I'd been mostly blocking, I'd get meaty heavy startered for 4k damage. It might not always be the case, but blocking wins games and at this level people will mostly be timing their oki correctly. In many situations at this level, I found my opponents at this level will burn themselves out trying to open me up in the meantime.

4) Unlearning your bad habits may be more important than learning good habits. I need my divekick button turned off sometimes lol. The time to learn not to do a particular thing or over-rely on a particular gimmick is not later, it's now. Gimmicks have their place, but you'll thank yourself later for putting in the word to learn your solid, basic game plan (sprinkled in with some ungabunga double neutral jump DI nonsense)

5) You can do it. I'm a god damn idiot and if I can, you can to, I promise. ",12,1765819917.0,StreetFighter,7,0.83,False

Is matcha just a passing trend, or could it be a legit business? Do you think people actually want healthier « clean » options, or is it too pricey for most? (Particularly in Europe here)

Would a dedicated matcha shop make sense, with variety of matcha drinks mixed flavours like pistachio or mango innit, pastries? or are coffee shops already covering the market?

And what about putting one next to a gym? It may be helpful to capture a niche market 

Also it is less expensive than a regular restaurant

1pndfxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Late_Rimit/comments/1pndfxf/i_live_with_white_carpeting_a_frazzled_guide_to/,I Live with White Carpeting: A Frazzled Guide to Carpet Cleaning,"Hi, my name is Regret. I installed wall-to-wall white carpet in my entire downstairs area two years ago (I live in florida in case that explains it, that’s just what the vibe down here’s like). I thought it would make the space look bright and serene. It did. For one week. Then my dog had a stomach bug, someone dropped red wine, and I learned what toddler yogurt projectile physics looked like. :D 

So obviously, I had to figure out how to clean that shit and maintain at least a nice cream color on the carpeting if I couldn’t get a pure dazzling white. 

Cue the research and now that I know what I know after a lot of trial and error and tiktok videos (wait has anyone seen that one of the lady who stained her white carpet a week before selling her house?) so now I’ll give all you lovely people all this info so you don’t have to spiral like I did

**Home Remedies:**

Test out the cheaper stuff first, like I’m only including the ones that actually worked for me, got these off the net and tiktok and stuff. But they’re pretty basic so I trust my sources. 

**1. Dawn Dish Soap + Hydrogen Peroxide**

This is the MVP. Especially for organic stains (coffee, wine, pet puke, etc.). Mix 1 part blue Dawn with 2 parts hydrogen peroxide. Spray lightly, blot (don’t rub), then rinse with warm water. 

*Note:* This can bleach darker carpets. Spot test first. Also on white, go slow and don’t pour the whole thing over it or it’ll turn blue. 

**2. White Vinegar + Warm Water + a Tiny Bit of Dish Soap**

Safe for most carpet types. Works well on light odors, mild stains, and mysterious splotches. Less effective on protein-heavy things (blood, pet stuff). This is just for basic maintenance, like you can add the sol to your vacuum if it has the little slot for it. 

**3. Club Soda for Fresh Wine Stains**

Immediately pour club soda on the stain and blot like your life depends on it. Don't scrub. It works if you catch it early. (I’m a wino if it wasn’t fkn obvious)

**Things to Avoid:**
* **OxiClean directly on carpets:** too harsh on wool blends.


* **Too much water:** can soak into the pad = mold party (don’t even try it)


* **Essential oils:** your carpet doesn’t need to smell like a spa, it needs to be clean. Oils can stain.


Okay so obviously these work mostly on milder stains and all depend on the amount of elbow grease you put in, so for larger areas of carpet you do need one of those carpet cleaner machines. I am gonna leave a review here for some of the good ones, feel free to add onto it in the comments. 

Ok I see a lot of tables for reviews here, but i’m not very tech savvy, so just putting up simple pro con lists and I put all the products into like an Amazon list that I’m linking here in case anyone needs it: https://www.amazon.com/shop/couturei_official/list/3J0V9VKWFYW1W?ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_s_ofs_mixed_d

**Shark Stain Striker**

**Pros:**

* Super compact and easy to store
* Dual solution tanks = less refilling mid-clean
* Great for fresh stains, rugs, and upholstery
* Spray pressure is solid meaning it actually hits the stain
**Cons:**

* Not built for whole-room carpet cleaning
* You need their cleaning solution for best results
* Hose is a little short if you’re reaching awkward spots


**Bissell s Little Green (Pet Deluxe I think)**

**Pros:**

* Amazing for pet stains and smells
* Works well with enzyme cleaners
* Comes with pet tools that actually WORK (like the brush and the crevice one, sooo good)
* Feels durable, not plasticky
**Cons:**
* Small tank = lots of trips to the sink
* Still needs manual scrubbing in some cases
* Suction isn’t always great on thicker rugs


**Hoover’s SmartWash Automatic**

**Pros:**
* Push to wash, pull to dry = very intuitive
* Covers big areas quickly
* Has a dry-only mode (surprisingly useful)
* Deep cleans better than expected
**Cons:**
* It’s heavy and a bit bulky
* Needs a pre-vacuum EVERY TIME
* Not great for tight corners or stairs (no crevice tool sadly)

Hope this helped someone out. Honestly, if you have an area rug only, then the home remedies should be enough or a tiny handheld vacuum but if its wall to wall, its better to have a machine on hand.

It's set in the same world as my [previous four-part vampire series](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASMRScriptHaven/comments/1b449id/f4m_an_evening_with_your_vampire_mistress_dark/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). You do not need to read the previous one to understand what's going on here- but if you do decide to check it out, then well....more fangs, more fun ;)

A patron and collaborator, **T**, is one of the main reasons this new tale exists. He made an 80-page google doc (over time) about the original series- its world, characters, themes, lore, and his own ideas and interpretations. I was floored, to say the least. But it felt really good, knowing that someone out there liked something I'd written so much. T greatly expanded on the original lore, and raised some really interesting questions. From our discussions, an idea for a new story was born. I was happy to advise, but had no intentions of returning to that ""dark land of mansions, ballrooms and twilight."" Time passed, and things slowly, naturally fizzled out, as is often the way of conversations.

Cue forward several months, and I decided to revisit what I'd created earlier. It was time to return, for reasons I'm not entirely sure of. It just felt like the time. I picked up the quill, told T about it, and- with his blessings- finished what we'd started.

Suffice it to say, while T and I couldn't collaborate on the actual writing itself, I drew inspiration from his ideas, critical appreciation, questions and observations as I was writing the scripts. And, perhaps even more importantly- without his interest, I honestly don't think I'd have written this series. So, if you end up liking what you read, say it with me- ""T, you're a real one!""

**Behind the Scenes:**

You know, Rially-bored ASMR - who filled all four parts of the original series- once said, while responding to a listener, something along the lines of, ""There's just something about a villain who refuses to see what they're doing is wrong.""

That might be a pretty apt description of the female lead from the previous tale. As is often the case with my characters, I didn't give her a name. T referred to her as ""The Lady"". I initially found it a bit BDSM-y, but hey, so was the original series! Well, could be argued. Anyway, the name grew on me. So that's who she is. The Lady.

As for the girl in this story....well, you'll form your own opinions about her if you read....and I don't really know what to call her. She is ""The Duchess"". Or perhaps, just ""The Girl"". Or anything else she becomes to you.

**USAGE POLICY:**

**SCRIPT:**

*(SFX: Storm, raging in the night. Thunder and rain.)*

*(SFX: Carriage, driving down the rain-soaked cobblestone. Gently screeching to a halt.)*

*(SFX: Carriage door swings open)*

I think I can walk on my own from here.

Yes. Please wait outside, Jonathan.

Now....about that-

(Brightening up) Ah, there you are, my dear friend!

Mhmn. Good evening to you as well. Although, it is frightfully cold! Such tempestuous winds, tossing about in the dark. I much prefer the soft bedsheets and warm bedchambers of some sequestered castle to this....to being out in this stormy weather.

Yes, Annalise. I wouldn’t have come out here if it weren’t important. I have lost my....shall we say, sustenance. A rather tragic state of affairs. I am very much in need of something new. Hopefully something that keeps me company for a while longer this time.

Have they arrived? The....humans?

Right. Lead the way.

*(SFX: Boots, echoing in the rain)*

Yes, um, I....I drank a little too much from the last one. It was an honest mistake. I just couldn’t stop, and....well. They were gone.

(*Sounds of the storm grow fainter, rain on rooftops)*

I’m alright. Humans are fragile things. I would know. Or at least, I thought I would, but-

Yeah. It’s a shame. I don’t want to go back to chalices and decanters. I prefer being able to sink my fangs into the real thing. There’s nothing quite like....like tasting the adrenaline in your prey’s blood, you know?

(Muttering softly) Of course you do.

*(Footsteps stop)*

So, this is the new batch of humans? How long have they been here?

(A longer pause)

I see. Well, you and your associates have certainly kept them in good health. I do not see any ribs, marks or rags. No fear in most of their eyes. Apprehension, maybe. Submission, definitely. Knowing full well what’s going to happen to each of them eventually, and coming to terms with it. There’s a macabre sense of beauty to it.

You don’t need to point him out to me, Annalise. He’s the only one whose eyes still smoulder. Strangely resolute, given his predicament. There’s something akin to rage in those eyes, but....hmn...softer, somehow.

*(Footsteps approaching the listener)*

So.....you’re the vampire hunter, hm?

I beg your pardon, *sir*?

(Wry laughter) Oh come now, little hunter. Isn’t your kind supposed to be a pious, righteous bunch? Such words are rather unbecoming of you, my dear.

(Sighing amusedly) Must you really inflict such vitriol upon us? I’d say we’ve treated you with kindness. It’s more than what you deserve, after everything you’ve done. Do you think killing vampires is a nice thing to do?

Well, as a matter of fact, no. I don’t think killing humans is a nice thing either. It’s just necessary, sometimes. Unavoidable, occasionally. I don’t feel remorse when I see you humans die, but it’s not like I derive any pleasure from it.

(Chuckling) Oh, the devil knows I’m no saint! But what about you, hunter? Shouldn’t you be worrying about yourself? Do you know what’s going to happen to you?

(A longer pause)

“Sold off to some leech as her personal bloodbag”....quite the charmer, aren’t you?

Mmnn. But I can sense your skill. It’s present in your posture, the look in your eyes, your very essence. It was quite a hassle taking you down. Two vampires lost their lives.

Does it bring you some level of satisfaction? Knowing you were responsible for putting them below the earth? ....Does it?

So much edge! My, my. It’s a shame there are so few of you. There always were few. Shunned and excommunicated by your own society, forgotten and left by time and history to slowly die out. Your ancient art, lost in obscurity. You are practically all that’s left of your old religion.

(Softly) Maybe things would have been different if there had been more of you, on that night. That night, when everything....changed.

(Sighing) Probably not. It wouldn’t have mattered how many of you there were. The Night Court cannot be challenged. The nobles are the rulers of this world, and their power is absolute. You.... couldn’t have changed anything back then, and you cannot change your own fate now.

Annalise. Remove his shackles. I’ll be taking this one.

Oh, I agree those shackles look lovely on him! And they do a stellar job of confining his magic. But they’re unnecessary. I’m pretty sure I can handle whatever he’s got planned. (Laughing confidently, with a hint of sultry)

(Softly) If you see a tiger in the wild, would you want to lock it inside a cage? Such a fine specimen. It’s a shame, putting him in those humiliating restraints.

Yes. You do not need my pity. But you still have it. I do pity you, my poor, defeated hunter. (Giggling, oddly light and free spirited)

*(SFX: Metallic restraints, gently undone)*

There you are. How does it feel to be free again?

Really? No sudden moves? No blasts of holy magic? Not even trying to run away? (Sighing disappointedly) Are you one of those rational types? Weighing your options, biding your time?

How disappointing. But oh, well. (Smiling cryptically) It’s too soon for me to start fixing you.

Come on. Give me your arm.

(Eyebrow raised) Well?

You can either come willingly, or I can put you under my thrall. If you try to attack me, then I won’t feel bad for putting you down. Just how easy or difficult this has to be, is entirely your choice. (Smirking) *Hunter.*

(Soft, gentle) Give me your arm. I’m not going to hurt you, as long as you don’t give me a reason.

(A longer pause)

(Smiling faintly) Good boy. Thank you for listening to me. Come along now. Let’s go.

No, Annalise. I....I don’t think a collar will be necessary.

That will be all. I’ll have your payment delivered tomorrow morning. Have a good night.

*(SFX: Footsteps, echoing again. No dialogue for a while.)*

*(The storm increases in volume again, as they step outside.)*

Not one for conversation, are you?

Is it because I’m a vampire? Is it the red eyes? The fangs? The frost in my touch? Or are you just afraid of women in general?

You’re not afraid of me? (Cocking her head) Hm.

Nothing. That’s....nice to know.

Yup. I don’t want your fear, or your worship. Only your blood. Oh, and some earl grey when I wake up in the morning would be nice. I can get a bit cranky without it.

No. Why would you think I’m joking? Are you going to say next I don’t deserve to enjoy a cup of tea because I’m a vampire?

Excuse me?

Oh. You prefer coffee, huh? (Sighing with colossal disappointment) This was a mistake. I don’t think we’ll be able to get along.

Oh, no no no. I’m not going to release you. No, clever little thing. You cost me a small fortune. I intend to get good use out of you.

Please. It’d be so wasteful to drink you dry in one session. I’m not an uncultured monster. If I did that, then....

Then I’d miss your company, wouldn’t I?

*(Footsteps stop)*

Well, this is my carriage. In you go. Sean says hi. Or, *neigh*, I suppose. See? He’s sniffing the air around you curiously.

Umm, are you going to get in, or....?

You can talk with the horse later. Right now, I’d very much like to get away from this rain and thunder.

You know who I am, right?

That’s correct. I am the Duchess of Morwena, at your service. And I’d like to take you back with me to my manor. A hot shower and a warm meal would do you good. I’d be happy to pop open one of my vintages as well to celebrate our little....meet cute. But knowing you hunter types, you probably don’t drink anyways. And I hate to drink alone, because it reminds of the past and of depressing things, so....

I beg your pardon?

“Drop the act”? I do not understand. What act?

That’s not true. I do care about you. About....(surprisingly gentle) what happens to you. I just bought you, didn’t I? I wouldn’t do that, if I didn’t care.

You must have overheard me talking with Annalise. You have keen senses, sharper than most humans. It must be one of the reasons you’ve survived for so long.

(Sighing quietly) I lied earlier. I....I’ve never had a pet of my own before. Nor have I ever drained someone to death. I don’t even know what it’s like, to sink my fangs into someone’s neck.

Your eyes see more than they let on. Do you think I’m lying to you?

The rumours? The stories? They’re distractions. A facade I have to build and maintain, because I am Duchess. I can’t be seen as soft. Especially because I’m not one of the pure bloods. I was turned.

(Lingering silence)

I can’t interpret that look in your eyes. Why are you looking at me like that, my dear hunter?

(Softly) No. I chose to be turned. I lived most of my life around vampires, and I willingly chose to become one of them. There was someone I wanted to protect.

Being a vampire is the best feeling in the world. The power, the immortality, the ability to transcend fate and the cruel, whimsical hand life deals you- to be above the natural order of this world itself. It’s the best kind of drug. I am no victim. I am an empress of the night. But....(eyes staring at the ground) now that I finally have become strong, there’s nobody left to protect.

It’s a story for another day. It sheds no fire in this cold, dreadful storm. Will you please get inside the carriage?

Please.

(A longer pause)

*(SFX: Carriage door, swinging shut. The sounds of the storm outside grow faint, muted.)*

Thank you. I promise you, your obedience won’t go unrewarded. I am going to take good care of you. I’ve never had a pet before, but I’ll try my very best.

What’s with that expression? Is it because I called you a pet?

(Smiling gently) I’m sorry. Was that too soon?

What should I call you then? Tell me your name. Mine is-

No need for names, you say? (Puzzled) Why is that?

Yes. Names spark familiarity. Familiarity, trust. And trust, builds relationships. I am not asking for you to trust me. Nothing so heavy. I’m just asking what I should call you.

Won’t you tell me your name?

(Sighing) It’s no fun if I find it out through other sources. If you won’t give me your name, then maybe I will give you a new one.

It’s not uncommon for vampires to take human pets. Many humans who receive such a privilege, are usually asked to let go of their previous names. Their old identities. Their owner gives them a name.

Of course you’d say that. It’s a stamp of ownership, of possession. And I’m not saying you’re wrong. But personally, I’ve always felt it’s....it’s symbolic of something else.

A new beginning. A gentle tug, to let go of the past. To spare the humans any lingering guilt of embracing their new lives.

(Sighing gently) Whatever. Since you belong to me now, and you won’t tell me your name, how about I just call you....

....Sunshine?

You hate it? Well, good. Sunshine it is then. (Faint giggling)

Why did I pick that? (Coy, cryptic) No reason. And if there is, maybe I will tell you one day.

Hey. You like killing vampires, don’t you?

Sorry. Stupid question. But anyway, I have a proposal for you. There are- well, there are two things I need from you.

Firstly, how would you like to help me take down some evil vampires?

(Stunned silence)

What? I’m not joking. You think there’s no bad blood between vampires? Pardon the pun.

You need more than that? (Leaning back, sighing) Fair enough, I suppose.

Well, there are some vampires right here in Morwena- my own city- who have gone rogue. Slaughtering humans without rhyme or reason. It’s the latest in a long string of such incidents. The Night Court has been witnessing more and more of these insurgents who refuse to fall in line. It’s not a good look for the ruling class. And it’s terrible for the economy. We lose out on systemic labour and blood supply if we allow the indiscriminate killing of humans.

It’s simple, really. In a world ruled by vampires, the most a human can hope for, is security. Even if you’re livestock, most of you should still be able to live out your natural lives. I won’t have humans dying for no reason in my own dominion.

Because I don’t like it. (Frowning, as if tasting something bitter) Seeing your kind die....it makes me feel uncomfortable. Like a pit in my stomach I can’t fill.

Enough of this. Are you in or not?

Of course you have a choice. I won’t force you to potentially put your life in danger. (Sighing) You can just be my blood bag, my precious butler for the rest of your days. I will look after you. I just....I want you to know something.

Even if you’re my pet now, you haven’t been declawed. I’m not going to change you. I took you in, because I don’t want to see you being humiliated and paraded around like a trophy by some spoilt princess.

You can still be you. I just- you know- can’t have you running around randomly killing vampires. (Smiling gently) Only the ones I mark out. The truly evil ones, who need to go.

What do you say, Sunshine?

No. I’m not going to stop calling you that. Answer the question.

(A longer pause)

Maybe....? (Smiling smugly)

Nothing. I just- no, I’m not smiling.

I don’t know what you’re talking about, my dear.

No, I most certainly won’t “forget it”. You said maybe. You didn’t say no. That’s a start.

In any case, we can discuss this further tomorrow, after you’re rested. Now, for the other thing I want from you....

(Leaning in, whispering) Haven’t you guessed already?

Tilt your head to the side. I....I’d like to taste you.

What? You’re a hunter. Surely you must have vampires going for your neck all the time. Why’s this any different?

Oh? This is consensual, is it? Does that mean you’re giving me consent to drink from you?

No....I’m afraid you don’t get a choice in this one....(whispering up close- intense, alluring) you have no idea how much restraint it has taken on my part, for me to....to not simply take you as you sat there for so long, mere inches from me....

I haven’t drunk blood all day. I’m positively parched. I have needs. And you’re going to fulfil them. Tilt your head. (Whispering) Let me feed.

(Gently) What is it? Are you still unsure?

Will you at least look at me then, while we’re talking?

Please?

Yes. Just like that. (Whispering) Look into my eyes.

Pretty, aren’t they?

I didn’t expect you to let your guard down so easily. I thought it’d be harder than this, putting a vampire hunter under my thrall.

(Amused) Cheating? Hmph. Maybe. Does it matter? I’d rather put you under my spell- only partially, only for a moment- and then cup your cheek....just like this....and reveal that vein on your neck- pulsating, virile, pretty- I’d rather do this, than pin you down and forcibly take that which now belongs to me. (Whispering) Your lifeblood.

Hold still for me, my sweet. (Whispering) I....I want you to be my first.

*(SFX: Sinking her fangs in. Gently.)*

*(Vampire feeding sounds. No dialogue for several seconds. Only the rain outside.)*

(Finally pulling back, breathing heavily)

(Almost in awe) So this is what it feels like.

(Her teasing confidence returning) I can see why some vampires get so addicted to this.

Sunshine? Did I take too much? Are you- hey, are you alright?

Huh. You plopped down on my lap. I can’t imagine you doing this intentionally, so you must be fading into dreams.

(Formal, impassive) Jonathan. We can get going now, if you please.

*(SFX: Gentle motion of the carriage)*

Don’t worry, Sunshine. You can stay like this. You have certainly earned a nap on my lap. (A little chuckle)

You know, your hair’s kinda soft. I like it.

(Sighing gently, breathing audibly)

In a world ruled by vampires, the best a human can hope for, is security.

And the best a vampire can hope for, is.....(increasingly unsure, strangely vulnerable) is....

I....

(Sighing heavily)

1pndd3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1pndd3k/i_ignored_stomach_pain_for_8_months_because_i/,"I ignored stomach pain for 8 months because I couldn't afford to be sick. Now I'm $12,000 in debt and still not fully recovered.","I make $45k a year working in customer service. On paper that sounds survivable. But in reality I'm done.

In January I started getting this burning sensation in my stomach after meals. Not every time, just occasionally. I'd take Tums and it would go away. I figured it was stress or bad food choices. I work long hours, eat irregularly, drink too much coffee. I thought everyone has stomach issues sometimes.

By March it was happening more often. The burning would wake me up late night. I'd chug milk straight from the carton standing in my kitchen. I bought economy size bottles of antacids. I started avoiding certain foods. I told myself I just needed to eat better.

I didn't go to a doctor because I don't have health insurance. My job offers it but the premiums would take almost $400 from my paycheck every month. I did the math - that's groceries. That's my car payment. I couldn't afford to be insured, so I definitely couldn't afford to be sick.

By June I was taking 8-10 Tums a day. The pain wasn't just after eating anymore. It was constant. A gnawing, burning feeling that made it hard to focus at work. I'd sit at my desk clutching my stomach, trying not to let my manager see. I lost 15 pounds because eating hurt so much I started skipping meals.

One night in July I woke up and vomited blood. Not a little. Enough that I panicked. I sat on my bathroom floor at 4am, shaking, trying to decide if I was dying. I didn't call an ambulance because I knew that alone would cost thousands. I waited until morning and drove myself to urgent care.
The doctor took one look at me and said I needed to go to the ER immediately. He suspected a bleeding ulcer. He was right.

I spent two days in the hospital. They did an endoscopy, found multiple ulcers, one of them actively bleeding. They gave me IV medications, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors. They told me I'd waited way too long. That if I'd come in when symptoms first started, this could have been managed with medication and lifestyle changes. Instead I let it get so bad I needed emergency intervention.

The hospital bill came to $11,847. My ER visit, the endoscopy, the overnight stays, the medications. I don't have insurance so there's no negotiated rate. That's the full price.

I set up a payment plan. $350 a month for the next three years. On top of my rent, car payment, utilities, student loans, credit card debt from previous medical issues I couldn't afford. I'm taking home about $2,800 a month after taxes. Almost half of that is now spoken for before I even think about food or gas.

The worst part? I'm still dealing with the aftermath. I have to take expensive medications twice a day. The generic version is $180 a month out of pocket. I have to eat bland food, no coffee, no alcohol, multiple small meals a day. My grocery bill went up because I can't eat cheap processed food anymore - it aggravates the ulcers.

And I'm terrified it's going to happen again. Every time my stomach hurts even a little, I panic. What if the ulcers come back? What if I need another endoscopy? I can't afford another medical emergency. But I also can't afford to see a gastroenterologist for follow-up care. So I'm just... hoping the medications work and nothing gets worse.

My mom called last week asking why I sounded so stressed. I broke down and told her everything. She was horrified that I'd let it get that bad. She asked why I didn't come to them for help, why I didn't get insurance, why I didn't go to a doctor sooner.

I tried to explain. That insurance premiums were impossible. That I thought it would get better on its own. That I was scared of medical bills I couldn't pay, so I just... didn't go. Until I had no choice.

She doesn't understand. She and my dad have good insurance through his job. They've never had to choose between seeing a doctor and paying rent. They've never had to ignore pain because acknowledging it meant financial ruin.

She said I was being irresponsible with my health. That I should have made it a priority. And she's right. But what she doesn't get is that when you're poor, everything is a trade off. I prioritized not being homeless. I prioritized keeping my car so I could get to work. I prioritized eating.
I gambled that my stomach pain wasn't serious. I lost.

Now I'm paying for it in every possible way. Financially, physically, mentally. I lie awake at night doing math in my head, trying to figure out how to make $2,800 stretch to cover $3,000+ in essential expenses. I feel stupid for waiting so long. I feel angry that this is even a choice I had to make.

 a few weeks ago when I was having bad pain again and panicking that something was wrong. I couldn't afford another ER visit so I just... messaged to chatgpt and described my symptoms. It helped me understand what was normal recovery pain vs. what needed immediate attention. Yeah I know it not a replacement for a doctor but when i can't afford a doctor again.

I don't know what the point of this post is. Maybe just to vent. Maybe to warn people that ignoring health problems doesn't make them go away - it makes them expensive. Maybe to say that being poor in America means your body is a luxury you can't always afford to maintain.

If anyone has advice on navigating medical debt or finding affordable care, I'm all ears. Right now I'm just trying to survive until next paycheck.",170,1765819678.0,povertyfinance,38,0.96,False

1pndabk,https://www.reddit.com/r/precure/comments/1pndabk/how_i_would_rewrite_happiness_charge_pretty_cure/,How I would rewrite Happiness Charge Pretty Cure (Part 6: Episodes 19 - 22),"Welcome back to my rewrite of Happiness Charge Pretty Cure. This is part 6 of my rewrite, so if you haven’t seen the other five parts I highly recommend you check them out to not get lost in the context. Last time devastation was brought on by the tension between Hime and Iona, only time will tell if they put aside their differences. But first…why don’t we take a trip to my home country?

**Episode 19: Landing in America! Liberty Girls Pretty Cure Appears!:**
Picking off where last episode left off, Cure Princess is sitting on the edge of a building, still crying a river as she’s filled with regret given how much damage she had just done to Cure Fortune’s feelings with own rant, all while Ribbon tries to get her to calm down. At the moment, Hime’s mind is torn between two sides: believing she was right in standing up to Cure Fortune, but also believing she was way too hard on her. Still, Princess feels that she won't be able to regain her composure this time. Cure Honey and Lovely then arrive and comfort Princess, with them saying they understand what she feels, but she still shouldn’t let the regret get to her. Even then, Princess is a tough nut to crack here. Just then, Lovely receives a call from Blue via the Cure Line, and he tells them to report back to the embassy as there is someone they’d like to meet. Hearing his voice, Princess decides to turn to Blue as a last resort, and agrees to go with Lovely and Honey. Upon arrival at nightfall, the girls are introduced to another fairy named Rocky, a friend that Ribbon actually goes back with, not having seen him in eight months. Rocky is the fairy partner of the **Liberty Girls Pretty Cure** over in the United States, and after embracing Ribbon, he explains that the Liberty Girls have invited the Happiness Charge Cures to participate in a marketing campaign, with the Japanese and American Pretty Cure teams collaborating to make a short film about the war against the Saiarks. Yuko and Megumi are elated by this news, and agree immediately. Hime however says she needs time, and lies on the couch to process what’s going on. Blue checks on her and asks what’s the matter this time. Hime explains what happened today, and Blue gives her the advice that Hime has to control herself more and come to terms with forgiveness, in addition to still believing in her that she can overcome her struggles, and confident that she can come to terms with Cure Fortune. He then offers if Hime would like to go on the endeavor in America too, which she reluctantly agrees. Rocky tells the Cures that they will be meeting with the American Cures tomorrow morning, and expects them to arrive in Los Angeles by then. Hime also contacts Seiji via the Cure Line and asks if he would like to go too, but he declines, saying he has a matter of his own to take care of. With that, only the girls are able to go. After Yuko and Megumi head off to their respective homes, Hime gets some sleep after a harrowing day. The next morning, Hime is washed up, but nonetheless tries her hardest to look good for today. Yuko and Megumi show up dressed in their proper attire. With that, once in Blue’s Cross Mirror Room, the girls head into the mirror to Los Angeles. Upon arrival, the Cures are amazed by the color and atmosphere of the city. They spot the Liberty Girls Pretty Cure doing an artistic air performance over an elated crowd, with the Happiness Charge Cures in attendance. As the performance finishes, the Liberty Girls Pretty Cure introduce themselves: The Blue Cure introduces herself as *Cure Liberty*, the leader of the group whose from New York City, and whose unique attire consists of long blue sparkle-decorated hair that falls in loose waves to about knee-length, bright red eyes, white jewelry earrings, a miniature replica of the crown of the Statue Of Liberty on top of her hair, a white star shaped bow also on her hair, gold metallic bands on both her arms, a light blue mini-skirt, and red metallic boots similar to Wonder Woman’s boots. The Red Cure introduces herself as *Cure Freedom*, who lives in Los Angeles, and whose unique attire consists of long red hair, bright blue eyes, and accessories such as black shades, silver bracelets on both her arms (also similar to Wonder Woman’s), an eagle themed roman wreath crown on top of her hair, a yellow star shaped bow also on her hair, a pure pink mini-skirt, brighter red leg warmers, blue metallic boots, and her arms being covered with white detached sleeves decorated with white bows. Lastly, the Yellow Cure introduces herself as *Cure Rebel*, whose from Texas, and whose unique attire consists of yellow tightly curled hair worn in low pigtails with gold stars, red ruby earrings, a brown cowboy hat adorned with a gold star, similar to a sheriff's hat from an old western movie, a white neckerchief, and under her black vest she wears a blouse with puffy white sleeves, and each sleeve is decorated with another gold star, followed by a lighter yellow mini-skirt and having the same gold fringe as her vest. Her boots are white with blue trim that matches her dark blue fingerless gloves. After the American Cures show off, they notice the Happiness Charge Cures and bring them to the apartment they live in. Once inside Freedom’s apartment and after de transforming, the American Cure's civilian identities introduce themselves as Eleanor (Liberty), Lorraine (Freedom), and Jessie (Rebel). The American Girls say they're excited to welcome the Happiness Charge Pretty Cure to their collaboration on this project. They question why Cure Legend is not here, but nonetheless are fine with just the three of them. They then tell the Happiness Charge Cures to get ready as filming will start in three hours. While checking out the apartment, Hime notices a photograph of Cure Liberty and Cure Tender. Upon asking about the photo, Eleanor explains that she and Tender went way back, with the photo being dated about a year and eight months ago. Lorraine additionally reveals that Maria, along with Iona, were actually born here in America, but moved to Japan a short time later. Maria visited America occasionally to serve as extensive support for the Liberty Girls, as well as other parts of the world. Since then however Maria hadn’t lately come back as she had gone missing. Hime then explains her side of the story with Iona, and Jessie comforts her shortly after, believing she can sort things out with her. Meanwhile, Madam Momere appears in the sky and looks down L.A., claiming the warm atmosphere of the city is about to face its end soon. Soon after, the six Cures arrive at the city’s film studio, and after heading to a private area, the American Cures advise the Happiness Charge Cures to look good for the camera and give everything their all, which the Cures nod with approval, and so they all transform. Arriving at the studio, the film executives are delighted to meet the Cures, and soon relay the films plot and contents: A Saiark resembling King Kong is attacking L.A., and the American Pretty Cure have to defeat it, before then being saved by the Japanese Pretty Cure, to the point where they all work together. As shooting begins, the Cures begin to act out their respective scenes and lines while the editing and special effects teams do their thing. In one scene, Princess accidentally uses her powers for real and almost damages part of the set. Freedom prevents the executives from chastising her, and after Princess relays a similar event that happened yesterday, Freedom decides to teach Princess how to keep control of her powers and self esteem more. After a few rounds of training, Princess is able to maintain control and act out her scenes perfectly this time. After most of the filming is complete, it’s now break time. During this, when the actor playing the King Kong lookalike goes outside for some air, Momere appears before him and uses him to create a mega Saiark that resembles King Kong. The Saiark goes on a rampage throughout the city, and the Cures head out to fight it. During the battle, the weather and temperature becomes insanely cold, with Princess suspecting Madame Momere is behind this. Because of the harsh cold, the Cures struggle to deal effective damage to the Saiark. Rebel attempts to use Star Boomerang to damage it, but is captured and grabbed tightly by the King Kong Saiark, which climbs up the city’s Bank Tower, and the Cures have to save her. Rebel attempts to free herself but can’t be able to escape the Saiarks grasp. After the Saiark reaches the top, the remaining Cures, in a homage to the climax of the 1933 cult classic, fly around and attack the King Kong Saiark numerous times in an attempt to weaken it amidst the cold weather. Honey and Lovely use their respective attacks, while Liberty and Freedom use Rocket Blast and Red Glare Beam respectively. As the Saiark begins to lose its balance, Princess is hesitant to attack, but Freedom tells her not to be afraid, and that the situation won’t be any worse with her. Princess, now motivated by Freedom’s words, uses Blue Happy Shoot to effectively damage the Saiark, which loses its strength, releases Rebel, and plummets down to the streets below. The American Cures then use their group finisher, Tri-Star Power Blast, to purify the Saiark. From afar, Momere is enraged that her plan had failed before she leaves, and the cold weather in L.A. dissipates. Afterwards, the rest of filming resumes back in the studio and is successfully finished. The short film is then released to the public via a broadcast on *Pretty Cure Weekly* and several screenings on TV’s across the world, exploding in popularity. The marketing campaign is a major success, with both the Japanese and American Pretty Cure teams gaining mass popularity. After all that, the Cures witness festivities going on in the city streets atop a building. The Liberty Girls Pretty Cure thank the Happiness Charge Pretty Cure for their help and collaboration, with Freedom in particular congratulating Princess for maintaining control of herself, and Princess becoming nervous, unsure if she’ll keep it up. Lovely assures them that Princess has a lot to learn, and Honey wishes they’ll meet again soon. The Liberty Girls then offer the Cures a tour of the city of Los Angeles, and the Cures agree. But just then, from behind them, something…or rather, someone appears behind Princess, who turns around and looks at who’s behind her, and becomes shocked and horrified at who she’s actually seeing. Who is she seeing? Well, the next episode will answer that.

**Episode 20: A Sad Past!! Cure Fortune's Tears:**
Rewinding back to the end of episode 18, Cure Fortune is still crying out a river and unable to calm down. After a while, Fortune eases up on the intense waterfalls, and after which she de transforms. Glasan asks her if she is okay, to which Iona is silent for a bit. After a few rounds of hesitance, Iona gives her PreChanMirror to Glasan, and to her utter shock, Iona proclaims she is renouncing being a Pretty Cure. In a panic, Glasan begs Iona not to do so, but she can’t bring herself to move on, and leaves as Glasan becomes disheartened. The next morning, we are treated to the first appearance of Iona’s place, where Iona wakes up in her bedroom even more washed up than Hime was. Unlike in OTL where they were overseas abroad, Iona’s parents instead still live with her in Pikarigaoka. Once downstairs, a downtrodden Iona sits down for some breakfast. Her mother, Emi, notices her downtrodden daughter, and tells her she knows that it’s hard without Maria, in addition to thinking Iona is losing hope she’ll ever come back, when really Iona went through far worse yesterday. Emi however reassures her that everything’s fine. After finishing breakfast, Iona heads out for the day, but not before her father, Akio, tells her she’s forgetting her bottled water, but she’s already out the door. On her way to the dojo, Iona stops for a bit after once again remembering what happened yesterday, and starts to shed tears believing she was wrong to scold Hime like that, but also couldn’t handle Hime doing the same to her, still unwilling to forgive her. She then looks up to the rising sun before transitioning to a flashback, which takes place roughly two years ago, and is revealed to be the same flashback from episode 16 featuring Masuko Miyo. After managing to save Miyo, a young Cure Fortune struggles to fight the Saiark fielded by Oresky. Fortune attempts to purify it with Stardust Shoot, but it’s not powerful enough. Despite dodging most of the attacks she is eventually knocked to the ground. As Fortune struggles to get up, Oresky orders the Saiark to finish her, and she braces herself. Just then, Cure Tender, making her first full appearance, flies in and saves Fortune, single-handedly defeating it with Tender Rising Starburst, and freeing a man who was also one of Miyo’s co-workers. After Oresky retreats, Tender helps Fortune up and the two embrace. Tender thanks her for managing to hold off until she got here, and Fortune tells her she wishes she could get as strong as her. Masuko Miyo is elated by the two Cures she sees, and promptly interviews them with excitement. Fortune initially becomes nervous, while Tender tells her they did what they had to and they can count on them. After the flashback ends, Iona continues on to the dojo. While there, she trains with her grandfather, but is not as good as she was the last few training sessions. The master quickly notices something is clearly wrong with her, and tells her to take some time off until she is ready once again. In the locker area, Iona is packing her things after the day has ended when Seiji walks in and asks how things are doing for her. Iona, filled with frustration, asks Seiji why he would even bother coming up to her, especially when he saw how she was yesterday. Seiji tells her he understands what she’s been through, such as losing her sister and her life changing, but Iona tells him not to remind her of that, and Seiji then says that it was still wrong of her to treat Hime the way she did, and says that she shouldn’t have let the past get to her, and then tells her that there are ways she can move on. Hearing these words, as well as noticing she forgot her bottled water, Iona reaches her boiling point and snaps at Seiji, demanding he shut up. After a few seconds of silence, Iona realizes what she had done, in addition to more flashbacks from yesterday, and apologizes soon after before running off in tears. Kazumi notices and calls out to Iona to see what’s wrong,. Seiji tells her she’s not feeling well, but believes she’ll pull through. Later on Iona makes her way home and takes a look at one of her balconies, and another flashback occurs, with Iona and Maria chatting on the same balcony. This second flashback takes place a year and six months ago, the day before Maria’s abduction. Iona and Maria gaze calmly as they reminisce about their time as Pretty Cure together. Iona is still ultimately uneasy about how much longer she can handle her position, but Maria tells her as long as they manage to stick together they can defeat the evil responsible. Iona then says that lately Maria had always been heading to other places worldwide while Iona stayed behind, and asks why can’t she be able to go with her. Maria says she doesn’t want to bring her sister out on risky missions overseas, fearing she may not be strong enough for the stronger enemies outside Japan, as well as leaving the Hikawa’s home vulnerable. Iona still says she still wants to be strong as a Pretty Cure like her. Maria then decides to relent, and says she will be going to America two days from now, as a means to look back on memory lane during their childhood there, asking if Iona would like to go with her. Iona agrees, and says she can’t wait to be back in their birth home once again (oh how wrong you are). Maria then asks if Iona would like one of her Sappharons, the ones that make Pretty Cure stronger if you remember. Iona declines however, claiming she can handle things well on her own, with Maria promising she’ll be with her no matter what. With that, the flashback ends as we transition back to the present day with Iona on the balcony, as she starts to lose hope in seeing Maria again. Meanwhile in downtown Pikarigaoka, Seiji, bringing along Mao, decides to head to a store together. Soon enough, Glasan arrives and asks Seiji if he’s seen Iona, to which Seiji hasn’t, and relays everything that happened with her today. On the way to the store distant bangs are heard, and shortly after a Pretty Cure is sent flying in Seiji’s direction. Fortunately he manages to get himself and Mao out of the way. The Cure, who is orange pink with blue eyes, short brown hair, and a white bow, tells the siblings to hide somewhere safe as the area they are in is restricted. It turns out the siblings are caught in a battle against two Saiarks fielded by Oresky. Seiji heads into battle, but not before telling Mao to take cover inside the store, and she does. Then, Seiji transforms, unbeknownst to him that Mao actually saw him, and is more than elated to find out that her older brother is a superhero. Meanwhile back at her home, Iona is laying on her bed, still remembering what happened to Maria, after which we transition to a third flashback, with the sisters battling Phantom in an unknown dimension. The resulting scene has Fortune and Tender being blasted, with Fortune even de transforming, and Tender confused as she thought she would be stronger by now to defeat him. Then, Phantom targets a powerless Iona, but Tender manages to get in the way and get herself blasted. With Tender now unconscious, Phantom took her, seemingly for her to never be seen again, leaving Iona devastated before cutting to the present, where Iona struggles to keep her composure, now unwilling to replay that flashback again. Just then, Emi comes in with clean laundry and asks if Iona is alright. Iona says she isn’t in the mood to talk right now. Later, Iona is downstairs making her dad coffee. Emi then tasks Iona with a shopping list favor, to which Iona agrees to do. While on her way to the store, Iona is still feeling down, wondering what she could do to lift her spirits up. Just then, loud bangs are heard, and since that is near the shop Iona was going to, she rushes to the scene. Cure Legend battles against the two Saiarks and surprisingly does well even with other allies in the field. Unfortunately, the Saiarks gain the upper hand and knock out most of the Cures in battle. By this point the battle itself had become a slog, and Legend became weaker by the minute. Oresky taunts him, saying he had always wanted to see someone be so weak after all they have accomplished to be strong. Iona arrives and watches as Legend is unable to get up, but Iona of course is hesitant to help him, given all she had been through with him today. Glasan then appears, asking where Iona had been, and says Seiji is in danger, but Iona of course goes into a hiding spot and Glasan follows. Legend can only hold off the attacks with Legendary Barrier for so long, but it’s clear he is in grave danger. Glasan tries to persuade Iona to help him, but Iona just can’t bring herself to do so, believing she was the one who couldn’t help anyone or herself with all the anger and frustration she had been projecting, especially at Hime, and is unsure if she can be able to help fix what she had broke. Glasan however tells her that helping others and saving others will be a perfect step to redeem herself, especially since all she would have to do is save a Cure currently in danger, but Iona is still hesitant as it is the same person she has opposing views with. At that moment however Iona realizes that even if that’s the case, she shouldn’t let hate and downright jealousy dominate her feelings, and more importantly she shouldn’t let the bad things be all she thinks about as they would gradually break her in the long run, with her anger towards Hime being a prime example. After rounds of hesitation, Iona makes her decision, just as Legend’s Legendary Barrier breaks and he is injured badly. Oresky boasts that Cure Legend is his, and is confident he will get a raise. Just then, as the Saiark is about to attack, Iona gets in the way and angrily orders Oresky to not hurt Cure Legend. Oresky is disgusted by the fact that someone would even try and protect him like this, but Iona stands her ground, saying she is on the path of learning something: that hate is a path nobody could ever follow, that forgiveness and reconciliation is the only way to a bright future. At that moment, her PreChanMirror Glasan is holding lights up, and Iona notices, and after a few seconds, she grabs it from Glasan and tells Oresky to get ready. With that, Iona is back in action as she once again transforms into Cure Fortune, with her transformation sequence being shown for the first time. Fortune goes hard against the Saiarks, dealing effective damage to them but far from purifying them, all while Legend manages to be very surprised that Iona actually saved him, and of course is speechless. With no time to waste, he manages to tag in, using Solar Orb to destroy the wave of remaining Choiarks, before he and Fortune use their respective attacks to purify the Saiarks. Oresky is puzzled by the fact the two Cures have managed to make up for each other, before retreating shortly after. With the battle over, Legend thanks Fortune for her help and is about to take off, but Fortune tells him he was right about her, admitting that she was wrong about how she treated Hime, but is unsure if she’ll ever trust her, mainly due to her past still haunting her. Legend tells her she can still move on from her trauma, and when she finds out the truth perhaps she could forgive her after all. Fortune, shedding tears, embraces Legend. After this, Fortune says she wants to do things right and meet up with Hime, hoping to reconcile with her, albeit with extreme doubt. Then, Mao arrives midway, and is ecstatic by the presence of two Pretty Cure. Things almost go awry however when Mao refers to Cure Legend as “Seiji”, causing him to internally panic. Fortune tries to defuse the situation, but Legend does tell Mao to keep his alter-ego identity a secret from anybody else, which Mao makes a promise on. After returning Mao home, arriving at the embassy, Blue is surprised to see Iona show up, asking what happened, to which Seiji says is a long story. Iona then asks about Hime’s whereabouts, and Blue reveals she is in America, particularly in Los Angeles. Iona is shocked to hear this, as that was the place she had hoped to go to with Maria, in addition to checking out their old birthplace, but was unable to do so after Maria’s abduction, and is reluctant to go. Seiji however tells her that one day she’ll go together with Maria once she saves her, and reminds her that currently she wants to try and reconcile with Hime and hope to resolve things. After some hesitance, Iona relents, in addition to hoping she will see Maria again soon. Later, the Liberty Girl Cures offer the Happiness Charge Cures a tour of the city of Los Angeles, and the Cures agree. Just then, Fortune and Legend arrive and appear behind the other Cures. Hearing their feet land on the surface, Princess turns around and is shocked to find that Cure Fortune had arrived and followed her. A startled Princess then switches to full attack mode, charging at Fortune, only to be grabbed by Honey and Lovely. As Princess tries to break free, she continues ranting at Fortune as she stands there, saying that Hime is gonna be a tougher nut to crack than she thought. The episode ends as Princess continues to be held back from attacking Fortune as the other Cures watch.

**Episode 21: Iona’s New Resolve! Cure Princess’s Regret!:**
Picking up from the end of the last episode, Cure Princess continues to try and break free from Lovely and Honey’s grasp so she can attack Cure Fortune, but is unable to do so. One OP and title card later, Princess is now tired out and is passed out, in addition to de transforming. Fortune walks over and comments on how typical Cure Princess is with her emotions. Lovely and Honey ask why she’s here, to which Fortune says she came here because…well, she tries to spill the beans, but ultimately can’t bring herself to do so. Honey suspects she may have wanted to have a chat with Hime. Soon after, the American Cures notice Cure Legend, and Cure Freedom is elated by his presence, wanting to get his autograph, with Rebel saying she’s got a lot of stories to tell him. Liberty then asks what the heck is going on. It’s then that Fortune decides to tell the story with why she’s here, and begins talking about her past once again, but because we already heard it, the shot jump cuts to the story being finished, complete with the Cures now in their civilian forms and having grabbed typical American street food while they listened. Jessie says that was some story, while Lorraine is saddened by the loss of Maria, and Eleanor expresses that Iona finally decided to arrive. Iona says she only came here because she wanted to talk to Hime, realizing her anger with Hime was getting her nowhere. Just then, Hime, smelling the food nearby, reawakens, and upon seeing Iona she immediately transforms, but after being passed out and tired she is now hesitant to attack her, especially with her friends watching. Princess declares Iona will never find and scold her again, and she flies off in the distance. Shortly after, Iona transforms and flies after her, with Ribbon and Glasan following suit. With them gone somewhere, the Cures decide to go with the L.A. tour as planned. Meanwhile, in the Phantom Empire, Phantom learns of Princess and Fortune's whereabouts via info from Choiark spies, who were present during the battle with the King Kong Saiark and having witnessed the two Pretty Cure teams, and have spotted a chase between two of the members. With Mirage's approval, Phantom decides to initiate an all out assault. Back in L.A., two of the six civilian Cures venture through the Little Tokyo area in the city, with Yuko elated by the cultural accuracy of Japan in the city, complete with info by Eleanor. Elsewhere, Megumi is ecstatic by the fashion lines seen at West Hollywood, with Lorraine offering if Megumi would like to try out a couple outfits, which Megumi agrees. Elsewhere, Jessie and Seiji walk through Olvera Street, and Jessie explains about several historical facts and cultural enlightenment, which interests Seiji as he writes it down via his notes. Just then, he notices two shadows swooping over him and is concerned as we cut back to the chase between Princess and Fortune. Princess yells at Fortune to quit following her, and uses Princess Ball to fend her off, but Fortune dodges it, and tries to tell Princess she’s not here to scold her again, but of course Princess ain’t buying it. She then manages to hide in a nearby alleyway and de transform, refusing to come out. After de transforming herself, Iona tries to get Hime to come out, but she refuses, still angry at her for what she had done to her. Ribbon goes into the alleyway to comfort Hime, but even that can’t get her to come out. Luckily, Iona has an idea that will lure Hime out, and finds a concession stand. In the alleyway, Hime feels really hungry. She smells a scent that most likely leads to food. She finally slips out into the open, but upon realizing it was a trick, she angrily refuses to eat despite how she feels. To escape Iona, she uses the Ninja PreCards and creates a smokescreen to escape. Iona then changes into a roller skater using her own PreCards to chase after her. Meanwhile at West Hollywood, Megumi models stylish American fashion clothing, and decides to use them for inspiration for her fashion designing endeavor. In Little Tokyo, Yuko tries some sushi, particularly the California Roll, and she loves it. In Olvera Street, the chase between Hime and Iona continues when Hime runs into Seiji, who asks where Hime has been, just as Iona catches up. Hime gets behind Seiji, warning Iona to stay back. Iona tries to tell her she doesn't want to scold her again, but Hime won't listen. Seiji reminds Iona of what she has overcome before and that she can try, all while Hime steps back. The standoff between the three of them continues until a noise distracts them and they realize that Saiarks are nearby. The other girls in West Hollywood and Little Tokyo are also alerted of what is going on and they all believe the same. Megumi, Yuko, Lorraine, and Eleanor arrive in Griffith Park to find many Saiarks in the area and transform into Pretty Cure as they watch the Saiarks turn everything into crystals all over the area. Elsewhere, Iona, Hime, Seiji, and Jessie arrive at Sunset Strip to find the same thing, and they too transform into Pretty Cure. Two fronts from two locations begin. In Griffith Park, the girls are able to fight, but with so many Saiarks they find it difficult. Lovely is hit and sent into a wall of crystals as a Saiark prepares to finish her off. Freedom blocks it and uses Red Glare Beam to send it away. In Sunset Strip, Legend struggles against a Saiark until Princess uses her Twin Magnum Punch to damage it. In Griffith Park, Honey continues to fight, using her Super Sonic Spark, along with Honey Stamp to defeat one of them. In Sunset Strip, Rebel uses Star Boomerang to purify another Saiark, while Fortune uses Stardust Shoot to rid of another. She is able to be rid of it, but is pretty worn out. Legend tends to her before she claims to be fine, when suddenly Phantom appears. He starts to run and the Cures give chase. In Griffith Park, the Cures use their respective finishers to purify the many Saiarks they've had to deal with. Rocky also gains a bunch of Precards for the girls. When the girls see how many more Saiarks remain, they continue to fight. Meanwhile, the Cures from Sunset Strip catch up to Phantom, who mainly engages with Fortune. He is able to lure her into an unknown dimension. She realizes it’s the same dimension where Maria was taken, causing her much stress, as well as realizing he lured her here on purpose as he reappears, ready to fight her.

**Episode 22: The New Transformation!? Princess’s Great Wish!:**
Picking off directly from the last episode, Princess and Legend arrive to join Fortune, while Rebel stays behind to help the others. The trio stand before Phantom, and Fortune claims that she will defeat Phantom and is putting her life on the line. Princess tells her what she’s doing is dangerous, but Fortune insists, still hoping to save her sister. Back in L.A., Lovely, Honey, Freedom, Liberty, and Rebel continue to fight the Saiarks. Liberty uses Rocket Blast to cause the Saiarks to be weakened due to radial effects, while Lovely uses Punching Punch to damage them. Honey uses her Sparkling Baton Attack to purify them afterwards. Everyone returns to normal and the girls cheer before Rocky gains six new cards. Ribbon also appears and shows them that they are almost done collecting all of the cards, Lovely and Honey reveal they plan on granting Hime's wish of rescuing her home. It’s then Glasan shows up to reveal that Princess, Legend, and Fortune have all disappeared with Phantom. The girls are worried over the Cure's safety, given what they had been through, so they fly off as Ribbon and Rocky attempt to comfort Glasan. At Phantom’s dimension, the group continues to fight. Fortune is able to stand her ground pretty well, but he keeps taking her attacks with ease. She then uses Fortune Star Ring on him but he cuts every ring into pieces. The others try to find the Cures but they have no luck. They are joined by Ribbon and Glasan, who have gotten a call from Blue. He feels he has an idea where they are, and mentions that Phantom tends to create himself a pocket dimension, meant to serve as his own arena to fight most of the Pretty Cure he lured into. But he has no idea where or what it is. Glasan senses that Fortune is still okay, and Lovely begs Blue to help them locate the other Cures so that they can help them out. He asks the girls to come to the Cross Mirror Room right away, while the American Cures stay behind. Fortune continues to fight, but still it's no use due to Phantom still gaining the upper hand. Just as Fortune is about to meet the worst, Princess and Legend use Twin Miracle Marine Blast to severely damage Phantom, but he survives. Fortune is now weakened and unable to get up. Phantom regains his composure and Legend tries to attack only for Phantom to knock him back. Phantom then unleashes a new attack of his and uses it on Fortune, only for Princess to get in the way and take it herself. Fortune recognizes it as the event in which Cure Tender saved her. The impact is enough to de transform Princess. Phantom then picks up Hime’s old transformation device and disintegrates it completely. He then takes out all of Hime’s cards, burning them into nothing. In the Cross Mirror Room, Blue asks Honey and Lovely to pray for the others. He believes this will open the portal to find them, and he uses his own powers to open it. Phantom prepares to finish off Hime after noticing the pain she has fallen into, and as she falls into despair before the inevitable, Honey and Lovely suddenly appear to save her. Fortune and Legend are surprised to see them there and so is Hime. Phantom is also surprised to see the girls, but they claim that it was their friendship that helped out. The four Cures are angry that he sent so many Saiarks into L.A. and they promise to make him pay for it. As this goes on, Fortune approaches Hime and hands over her PreCards. She is going to use her wish on Hime instead of saving her sister. This surprises Hime even more, and Fortune explains that while she understands they may not reconcile given all they've been through, she wants to make up for all the times she was mean to her. Hime asks Fortune about her own wish to save her sister, not understanding why she would do this. Fortune tells her she let hate, agony and frustration get to her, and now she claims it’s her fault she put Hime in this predicament, but after having a pep talk with Seiji she realized chewing out Hime all this time was a big mistake, and while she also misses Maria a lot she understands Hime has her own job to do: Free her Kingdom and her parents and destroy the Phantom Empire, and knows whatever happened there was never planned to, saying now that it wasn't Hime's fault for any of this. It was the Phantom Empire's for choosing to do all of this to everyone and everything, and tells Hime she must end them for good. Hime wishes to help, and Ribbon asks her what she would wish for. With Fortune’s cards their album is complete. Hime wants to wish on saving her kingdom, but then she thinks back to before with the confrontation with Queen Mirage back in episode 15. She knows Mirage must’ve been through something, because why would she wanna offer everything back to her, including her parents? She realizes now that if she ended things now she’ll just be left wondering what really happened, and she wants to know exactly what caused the Phantom Empire to arrive in the first place. It’s now that Hime understands her journey is far from over. With the book finished and her desire to save everyone, Hime holds up the PreCards and wishes to become a Pretty Cure again. The cards and Ribbon both begin to glow blue as she congratulates Hime for her wish. She then gains the new PreCards for her to transform into before then gaining the Princess Piano, and with it she not only transforms into Cure Princess once again, but also with a new look. Now, Princess’s color is much bluer than it was before, ranging from her hair, pleated skirt, wrist pieces, and wings; complete with her vest being completely black instead of navy blue, a better crown on her head and better, shinier jewelry, slightly longer and more sparkly twin-tails, and in general a more stylish version of her typical Cure outfit in general, as well as a deep blue glow effect all around her. Princess looks around and is at awe and filled with energy over her new look. She approaches the others, and Phantom claims that her becoming a Pretty Cure again means nothing and that it was an idiotic and foolish wish. Princess admits that this was true, but says she knows something was up with the Phantom Empire, claiming she wants to know exactly the full story. Fortune is at awe over Princess overcoming her struggle, while Princess resumes fighting. She is able to easily deflect Phantom's abilities and fight back, even catching him off guard and surprising him, but he claims that the world is destined to fall into despair and he will see to it. Princess continues to take everything he gives her and she promises that if the world is really meant for that to happen then she will fix it. She then shocks him by destroying his sword by using her hand and summons the Princess Tambourine to perform Windy Ascension. The ability is so strong that it manages to defeat Phantom. The others run over to her, but she says the battle isn't over. While Phantom is weakened he claims not to have lost yet, but Queen Mirage interrupts, appearing before a defeated Phantom. Princess, seizing the opportunity, homes in on her and uses a new and improved Princess Ball to attack her, however it isn’t that effective. Mirage doesn’t hesitate to retaliate, now impressed that Princess is much more powerful than she could possibly imagine (Again, totally not a Star Wars reference!). With that, the first fight between Cure Princess and Queen Mirage begins, but it only lasts for at least 15 seconds, during which Mirage gains the upper hand before firing a powerful blast of dark energy from her staff when Blue intervenes. Mirage is enraged by Blue’s presence, and he speaks of love, happiness, and courage to “get her to stop”, but agitated from his “manipulation” she attacks him and the mirror starts to crack. Blue teleports everybody to the Cross Mirror Room just before the attack can connect. After a while, everyone returns to L.A. at sunset, where the American Cures are grateful that the Happiness Charge team is alright, with them admiring Princess’s new look. Liberty asks if they’d like to stay for a little longer, but Princess declines, saying she and her friends have other matters to attend to. After the American Cures give their goodbyes for now and take off, Princess looks out into the sunset and begins to shed a tear, already starting to regret the wish she wasted on. Fortune comforts her, telling her she’s doing the right thing. Princess apologizes to Fortune for all the mistakes she made before shedding more tears, and shortly after Fortune does too, and they then both cry as they embrace. Legend looks on as he believes they’ve finally got on the right track. Lovely asks what’s going to happen now, to which Honey proclaims that they keep fighting, declaring that given all they’ve been through they know their journey has more to come, and Lovely agrees, saying when they’re all together united they can overcome anything. As Fortune and Princess ease up, Legend asks what Princess thinks, and with that, with Honey, Lovely, Legend, and Fortune all by her side, Princess looks on to the sun setting once again, and proclaims that they are the Happiness Charge Pretty Cure and they will never give up. The five Cures watch as the sun fully sets, ending the episode.

Well? I told you it was gonna get better. So now the official team is composed of five Cures this time, which shouldn’t be too bad, and hey this color variety looks much better. With that, this will be our stop for the day. So, what do y’all think so far? Stay tuned for part 7!",1,1765819496.0,precure,0,1.0,False

I’m planning to do the yearly tradition of Simbang Gabi/Misa de Aguinaldo and thought it would be nice to have some company, especially since I find it a bit unsafe to walk or commute alone late at night or early in the morning.

This is purely platonic and wholesome—church companion lang talaga, no pressure or expectations. We can also have a short kwentuhan or coffee after mass (I badly want to buy bibingka and puto bumbong tho haha). Preferably, you’re from the same univ or nearby area, so it’s easier for us to visit the churches I’ve listed!

I’ll keep this post up until I find someone genuinely interested in the same setup. If this resonates you, just send a short intro about u and with an emoji 🏹.

1pnd8fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1pnd8fw/my_sil_26f_is_driving_me_28f_crazy_and_i_need/,My SIL [26F] is driving me [28F] crazy and I need advice on how to let go.,"
Hi redditors. I [28F] (& 30 weeks pregnant) am really struggling recently with my SIL [26F] and need advice on how to move forward and stop letting her affect me so much. I need her out of my headspace.

Backstory: my husband and I have been together for 11 years, married for 6. Our first year of marriage she became a different person—sent me a text about how she loved her brother more, that I would never be enough, yada yada. Everyone, her dad, my husband, told her how much in the wrong she was and that she needed to apologize and she just got worse. Cried about it to her dad, etc. I forget how we made up on this one since it was 6+ years ago, but I’ve always kept this in the back of my mind. My husband said she’s the kind of person who “finds the line with people she feels threatened with and pushes it. She's just psycho, wife. I warned you!”

We had an ugly, all out fight a couple of Christmases ago, maybe 3-4 years ago now. It all stemmed from me feeling disrespected, us not communicating, her ignoring me/the issue, not speaking to me, and when I finally confronted her, it devolved into yelling… and then we fixed it.

These are the two instances where it got very bad. Beyond these two moments, we typically keep it friendly, she supported me during my pregnancy loss, would come to my office with my niece and we would eat lunch together, and overall be on good terms.

Recently, I found out I was having a baby after a loss. This is where the energy shifted once again. Everyone joked she would have a baby out of jealousy, since her baby would no longer be the only baby in the family.

After our 20-week ultrasound, I sent a cute text in my in-law family chat showing my husband holding ultrasound pictures. She immediately responded with a picture of FIL holding her baby and saying, “here’s the original dad [insert family last name].” I would ignore this and follow up with another ultrasound picture I was excited to share, and she would immediately respond with a picture of her baby.

I (maybe against my better judgement knowing how we have been in the past) decided to text her on the side something along the lines of, “if you can’t be happy for me, you will not see a lot of me and my baby. Let me enjoy my moment!” She cried. She bawled her eyes out. She texted my husband (as if he didn’t know I sent this to her), my FIL, etc. She went and got lunch with my husband, telling him “I know I’ve said things in the past to get under your wife’s skin, but I promise this wasn’t that.” She cried more. Apologized TO MY HUSBAND. All the while never responded or spoke to me. She brough a candle to this lunch that my husband brought home and said it was “her apology gift.” Sigh.

From here, it’s been tense since. I texted her to get coffee or lunch so we could talk it out and I could explain my side. She didn’t respond. Instead, my FIL approached my husband and asked why I wanted to “sit her down” and that “she was freaking out” at my text. Like she was getting called to the principal's office. In her head the candle she bought me fixed all sins. Asked him what I possibly had to say to her. My husband told me she was “scared and intimidated of me” and to not expect her to sit down with me anytime soon. I simmered at this excuse and at my FIL’s enabling.

Since then, it’s just been a culmination of little things that I’ve taken personally, as well as a lack of resolution despite my best efforts. She doesn’t greet me when I enter a room. She sits far away from me at the dinner table. She wrote a card for my baby shower addressed to my baby and husband and did not address me at all. 

It’s really starting to destroy my mental peace. How should I move forward? How do I let her not take up so much of my headspace? 

Every time we drive to my FIL’s house, I tense up and get in a sour mood because I know she will go out of her way to exclude me from conversations, make underhanded comments, leave me out of family pictures, and pretend my husband is becoming a dad in a vacuum and I’m just a nonexistent vessel. My husband and I argue about it, even though he sees the same thing I do. He says I should just ignore her and let it go and this is how she is. I told him I did not want her at the hospital to meet the baby right after I’ve given birth, and he agreed, but I know it will be just another point of contention. His FIL will undoubtedly harass him about it. 

What would you all do? What do I do? Especially with Christmas coming up.

TLDR; I stood up to my SIL, she got offended, and now everything is really tense. She doesn’t want to sit and resolve it with me. I want to move on even though she treats me poorly at every family function and it messes with my mental peace. What do you all think I should do and how do I move forward?",5,1765819380.0,relationships,20,1.0,False

My education is the tool of the State, designed to build stability, not to articulate the fluidity of the soul. I am a Psychology student, charting the neural pathways of change, but the only revolution I truly crave is the one in my own axis.

My family’s love is a soft, supportive Acoustic Dampener; They believe in me, but they must dampen the impractical sound of the arts. Their sacrifice provides the foundation, but not the freedom. My father's ""Sayang"" is a quiet lament, not a shout of shame. The silent pressure to deliver return on investment stifles the voice that wants to sing through the feet.

I stand in the public university, a vessel of logic and theory. I watch the foreign masters, inheriting the Lexicon of Air, A flawless vocabulary built on wealth and time. My voice, my true art, is relegated to the marginalia of my life: Stolen, crude, Taglish steps against their perfect French. I envy their knowledge, for knowledge gives one the right to be heard. I feel like a changemaker without a megaphone.

My dorm room is my booth, my private voting station. I use the geometry of my body to make my silent protest. My back pressed against the wall, I am performing the Choreography of Resistance. The floor is cold; I am practicing the Economics of Effort— No wasted movement, only focused, desperate lift. I am running on the fumes of instant coffee and raw will to push and pull every muscle in my body.

I hold the imaginary shoes— They are not satin, but a shimmering, impossible petition for value. The pointe shoes I wasn't able to wear are my Unspoken Thesis— A public indictment of a system that deems art a luxury, not the necessary voice of a developing nation. They are the ghost of perfection, demanding a seat at the table.

But watch me, in the final hour before the campus lights shut down. I take the tendu I stole— Infused with the tired, disciplined energy of the scholar. My body, untrained, performs a Dichotomy: grounded in duty, lifted by defiance. This is not a dance for the theater; it is a Statement. I am the scholar who whispers his art, the voice that sparks change by refusing to let the mandatory silence erase the truth that creativity is not the opposite of security, but its deepest reason.

  
Reason/Inspiration:

I am driven by the **injustice of scarcity**, heartbroken that the beauty and opportunities in the arts are so unequally distributed due to financial practicalities.

1pnd2cf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pnd2cf,LET TALK ABOUT THE NO SPIDER. HERE...,"PITCH DECK: THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN - NO MORE HEROES
(The ""Absolution"" Saga)
Genre: Psychological Thriller / Post-Apocalyptic / Neo-Noir.
Logline: In a dying universe where hope is a liability, a broken Spider-Man must team up with a nihilistic reality-glitch and a ruthless Vietnamese survivor to kill a God that feeds on trauma.
Visual Tone: Children of Men meets The Batman (2022). Gritty, desaturated, visceral.
I. THE TRIO: DECONSTRUCTED
1. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) - ""The Ghost""
 * The Change: He wears a trench coat over a faded, stitched-together suit. He smells of rain and old blood. He doesn't quip. He doesn't swing gracefully; he falls with style.
 * Psychology: He is addicted to the suit because it's a shroud. He believes he is ""The Witness""—cursed to outlive everyone he loves. He fights not to save the world, but to punish himself.
2. Gwen-pool (The Anomaly) - ""The Nihilist""
 * The Change: She doesn't break the fourth wall for laughs; she breaks it to scream. She sees the ""audience"" as voyeurs enjoying her pain. Her edges literally ""glitch"" like a corrupted video file.
 * Mystery: She carries a blank comic book. Every time someone dies, ink appears on the pages. She knows the ending, and she finds it hilarious that everyone else is trying so hard.
3. Thanh (Original Character) - ""The Engineer of Dust""
 * The Change: No high-tech gadgets. Thanh is a mechanic of the apocalypse living in the ruins of ""Sector S"" (formerly Saigon). He wears scavenged riot gear and grease-stained clothes.
 * Philosophy: Radical Pragmatism. He views Peter’s heroism as a mental illness.
 * Arsenal: Tripwires, homemade napalm, rusted machetes, and physics. He doesn't save people; he calculates survival probabilities.
II. THE NARRATIVE ARC (THE DARK CUT)
PART 1: THE GRAVE OF EMPIRES
The Hook (Mystery):
Peter wakes up in a mass grave. But the bodies aren't random civilians—they are variants of Spider-Man. Hundreds of dead Peters, Miles, and Gwens. He is the only one breathing.
The Inciting Incident:
Wounded, Peter is dragged into a sewer bunker by Thanh.
 * The Introduction: Thanh checks Peter for ""The Rot"" (the infection of the villain) by holding a flame to his eye. No flinching.
 * The Meal: Thanh tosses Peter a piece of dry bread. Thanh: ""Eat. If you vomit, you're human. If you don't, I shoot you.""
 * The Artifact: Peter sees Thanh’s collection. Not trophies, but necessities. He uses lenses from dead Spider-Men to filter water.
The Conflict:
Gwen-pool is found sitting on a pile of rubble, drawing stick figures on a wall. She recognizes Peter but refuses to look at him. Gwen-pool: ""Oh great. A rerun. I hated this episode.""
Peter tries to save a crying child outside. Thanh warns him: ""Noise is death."" Peter ignores him. The rescue succeeds, but the noise attracts The Black Silence (monsters). Half the bunker is slaughtered.
The Turn: Thanh doesn't scold Peter. He just points to the dead bodies. Thanh: ""Your morality just cost us six lives. Are you a hero, or are you a hazard?""
PART 2: THE SILENT GOD
The Villain: Venom-Dormammu (""The Rot"")
It is not a physical monster yet. It is a frequency. It whispers in the characters' minds, offering them their ""deleted scenes""—lives they could have had.
The Journey:
They must travel to the ""Spire"" (a corrupted Landmark 81 tower) to kill the entity.
 * The Hallucination: Peter sees Gwen Stacy. She is alive, older, calling him to bed. It feels real. He wants to stay.
 * The Reality Check: Gwen-pool pistol-whips Peter to wake him up. Gwen-pool: ""It's just bad writing, Peter! Wake up!""
The Sacrifice (The Meat Grinder):
To bypass the Spire's psychic shield, a ""live circuit"" is needed.
 * The Dilemma: Gwen-pool suggests throwing a captured bandit into the machine. Peter refuses.
 * The Choice: While they argue, Thanh silently wires himself to the generator.
 * The Scene: Thanh: ""This isn't an American fairytale, Spider-Man. Someone pays the bill.""
 * He pulls the lever. The electricity fries his left arm. The scream is guttural and raw. The shield falls. Thanh collapses, his arm a charred ruin. No magic healing. Just the smell of burnt flesh.
PART 3: A PRAYER FOR THE DYING
The Final Battle:
No CGI armies. Just Peter (broken), Gwen-pool (fading), and Thanh (one-armed) in a muddy pit against the manifestation of The Rot.
The Horror:
The Rot summons ""Phantom Heroes""—rotting versions of Tobey and Tom that scream Peter’s failures at him. Peter must fight his own ""brothers.""
The Resolution:
 * The Stoic Act: Peter lets The Rot infect him. He uses his suffering as a weapon, overwhelming the entity with the sheer weight of his trauma until it explodes from the inside.
 * The Fourth Wall Breaks: Gwen-pool realizes the ""Script"" requires a tragedy to close the portal. She looks directly at the camera/audience.
 * Gwen-pool: ""You sick freaks want a tragedy? Fine. I'll give you a masterpiece.""
 * She tears herself apart, atom by atom, to stitch the reality wound shut.
The Reversed Redemption:
Peter tries to catch her (echoing TASM 2). He catches... nothing but fading ink.
 * Gwen-pool's Voice: ""Don't reboot me.""
 * Peter stands in the rain. He doesn't scream. He stands perfectly still. He has mastered the pain.
III. THE ENDING (THE AMBIGUITY)
The Return:
Peter wakes up in his own apartment in New York.
Was it a dream?
He looks at his hand. There is a scar there that wasn't there before—a scar in the shape of Thanh’s trap.
The Other Side:
Cut to the ruined timeline.
Thanh sits on a rooftop of the rebuilding city. He has fashioned a crude, robotic arm out of scrap metal and wires. It’s ugly, noisy, but it works.
He pours a cup of black coffee. He raises it to the empty sky.
 * Thanh: ""Cheers, Ghost.""
The Final Vision (The 6160 Cameo):
Before the screen goes black, Peter looks into a shop window. The reflection ripples.
He sees Earth-6160 Peter Parker—bearded, holding his daughter, laughing.
Our Peter (Andrew) touches the glass. He smiles. A true, tired smile.
 * Peter: ""We made it.""
IV. POST-CREDITS SCENE: THE GLITCH
Scene:
Peter’s apartment. Night. Silence.
Peter opens his closet to hang up the suit.
Inside the closet, lying on the floor, is Gwen-pool’s mask.
It shouldn't exist. She erased herself.
The Horror:
Peter picks it up. The white eyes of the mask suddenly blink.
A whisper comes from the mask, sounding like static:
> ""THEY ARE REWRITING THE SCRIPT, PETER. RUN.""

I definitely used to forego and push to the side persistence. Neville Goddard says it in almost every single lecture and book: persist in the wish fulfilled, persist in the assumption. But, of course, you don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

But for someone like me, and I'm a pretty hard case, very set in my ways - I sometimes thought my answer and my ways were the only way, and it closed me off to what I should be doing.

For example, with persistence, I would do a little bit here, a couple of hours one day, maybe a week later do a little bit again. It wasn't consistent. And I found that the more I wasn't persisting, my mental internal world and my self-concept were barely changing.

I also have a very pointed, almost OCD obsessive mind, so now I've learned to use that to my advantage. Now I persist quite a lot.

My Persistence Strategy:

First, do I persist every second all day long?Absolutely not. I have to focus on work, I'm watching YouTube, I run errands, playing video games, spending time with family and friends, and I need to live life. I’m not always, all day long, deliberately thinking and consciously creating.

Here is how I structure it though for myself:

- Mornings are for ramping up: I typically do a lot of rampaging and intense persisting right when I wake up.

- Throughout the day: Late morning, afternoon, and evening, if the thought comes to me, I will affirm and persist in the assumption. This is mostly using I AM affirmations.

The I AM affirmations, for me, really help program and assume the new self-concept. They also seem to naturally bring up the old, previous self-concepts for release.

- Dealing with Purges and Resistance: Sometimes, when I'm persisting, old emotions, old beliefs, former identities, and emotional energy come up for release. They usually call this purging I have seen, and mine can sometimes be pretty big.

I then just let myself have the release or the clearing, however long it takes (minutes or hours). When it passes, or I feel a little calmer and regulated, I get right back on persisting.

I also figured out easy times of the day to persist. I tried to ""hack"" myself and my day to see when I could persist easily:

1. When I'm in the shower.

2. In the mornings having my coffee.

3. Driving is a huge one. When you drive, you naturally move into a more relaxed, alpha brainwave state. You’re in the car, what else do you have to do for 15 minutes or an hour? It makes programming your mind much easier.
Evaluate your own day to see when your mind is freed up for persistence. Maybe it's visualization, maybe it's affirmations, maybe both.

For me, primarily, it’s words, affirmations, thoughts, and inner conversations. Visualizing comes secondary.

If I would have known years ago just to wholeheartedly persist, I would be accelerated light-years past where I'm at.

Since consistently persisting the past couple of months, I am seeing major changes I’ll list below.

- Mental state: Mental illnesses I had are disappearing, and I am way calmer and less affected by the 3D world.
- Proof in the 3D: People are reiterating conversations back to me that I've been thinking. Little clues and compliments regarding my manifestations are popping up.
- Body & Health: My body is changing into better shape without me exercising at all (I hate the gym, but I affirm and visualize myself as slim/fit). This shift is happening quickly. I also notice momentum building when I affirm to be younger.
- Career & Money: People in my life are bringing up job opportunities and even asking me if I'm bored and should get a new job (aligned with affirming for higher pay).
- Habits Disappearing: Old habits are simply falling away. I was identified as a single person for many years, but since persisting for a brand new relationship, I’ve realized and dropped that old identity. I have no urge to go on dating apps anymore either or “be on the lookout” for that person when I’m out.
- Finances: I’m affirming for more financial influx. My habits of spending are less and less. I have no desire to spend money like I was before. The thoughts don't even come into my mind. I also had a gambling habit, and now I have zero desire to do that in any way.
- Relationships: I'm less oppositional to people and feel much freer in my relationships. I can let things go and not dwell on what others do.

One Last Critical Tip!

If you feel resistance, don't try to persist through it. It hurts and it doesn't work.
Drop it, meditate, or allow. Let the resistance fizzle out, and then affirm and persist. If you notice emotional or belief purging, same thing: relax, allow it out, and then get back to affirming and persisting.

Self-concept automatically happens by affirming and persisting, at least for me.

I hope this was helpful and encourages someone else to really lean into persistence!

-A crochet/knit/craft group. Something where we all bring a little project and work together. Maybe it has a little brunch vibe to it! Something to curl up with a cup of coffee or tea. 
Or
-A little book club! I really love feminist/dystopian/speculative fiction. (I’m a really big Margaret Atwood fan, and wanting to read through all of her books).

I go to meetup events and it's all guys in their 20s-30s. They're talking about TikTok trends, video games I've never heard of, shows I don't watch. I feel completely lost in conversations.



Last week I matched with a 33-year-old on an app. We met for coffee and I could tell within 10 minutes we had nothing in common. He kept referencing memes and I had no clue what he was talking about. I felt ancient.



The few men my age I DO meet are either married or not interested in dating. So my options are either stay single forever or figure out how to connect with guys 10-15 years younger who might as well be speaking another language.



I don't know how to flirt with younger guys. I don't know what they find attractive or how to keep conversations going when we have completely different cultural references. Everything I say feels outdated or awkward.



How are 40+ people supposed to date when the dating pool is mostly younger people we can't relate to? I feel like I'm too old to learn a whole new language just to have a conversation.



Anyone else dealing with this? How do you bridge that gap?

Let's call him Jake. So jake and I kind of clicked since we both had interests in common, like movies and music, pop culture etc, but he was NOT a talkative person, he was usually a one word, two word texter, very nonchalant, kind of ignorant I'd say. And I am very talkative.
So for a month it was very much like me texting first, me taking initiative. 
Now, in late September, we had this huge cultural Event in our city, we all went in a big big group. 
I remember I told him that I am gonna be applying henna (mehendi, in Indian culture) on my hands, and he was like ""wow that's great, I'll do that too let's see who's is better"". And I was like WOW this guy knows how to apply henna?! Because not many guys, do that.
And on the day of the event it was nice, I was mostly with my bestfriend and he was with his, but everyone in the group had a feeling that we both might like eachother.

So after that, I don't know but something really changed, in October. It was really like I was streaming we fell in love in October on repeat. Yeah I am so stupid and lovesick.
But what changed was his way of treating me, now he was initiating alot, sharing alot, texting me like 15 texts in a row, I know it may sound YEAH BARE MINIMUM GIRL, but at the time for me it was like, aww he's opening up to me. And it was so so so smooth, we would talk EVERYDAY and not small talks, wed talk deep topics like, unconditional love, we would critic movies together, we'd watch eachothers favourite movies, and listen to similar music, I have a fucking 98% match with him on Spotify blend Aahhhh I feel so stupid.
October end, we were like so so close. He would really do speak highly of me too because he liked my personality. He was a very introvert and smitten guy.
He sends me reels about couples, like very very lovey dovey reels, and then edits and then these reels about ""how about we share wired earphones and stare into the sky"" type of reels.

I was falling hard.
Now in November, we finally went on a date we called it a hangout but still. We went on a PS5 date and for coffee. We both are really really introvert, it was so so cute seeing him blush and seeing him try to initiate, i loved it. I am also very introvert jn person. So yeah it was my first ever date and it was really really really cute. But I was the one to initiate it the hangout.
Even after that, we were smooth, we were talking about everything. 
Now this previous week, he has been acting a little distant, not initiating talks NOT SENDING ME REELS. He used to spam me with like 20+ texts and reels.

Now i tried 2-3 times to you know try to initiate a conversation or something. But it just didn't occur to be like we used to have.
I was now confused because wtf. And he's texting like he used to in August and September. I feel something is wrong. Because if youre busy just tell me you're busy. Whenever I used to be busy I'd still text him I'm doing some work.

Today, our sect of marketers—a collective of practitioners who've spent decades analyzing this industry—tackled a particularly uncomfortable truth: we're spending thousands of dollars and countless hours attending conferences that deliver precisely zero new insights.

You know the scene. You've lived it. The keynote speaker takes the stage with polished slides proclaiming ""AI is transforming marketing!"" followed by statistics you read in a LinkedIn post three months ago. The panel discussion circles around ""authentic storytelling"" and ""customer-centric approaches"" while you fight the urge to check your email. The breakout session promises cutting-edge strategies but delivers a glorified Wikipedia summary of marketing automation.

Welcome to the modern conference circuit, where innovation goes to get repackaged and insights go to die.

# The Uncomfortable Math of Conference Culture

Let's do some brutal accounting. A typical marketing conference attendance costs:

* Registration fee: $1,500-$3,000
* Flight and accommodation: $1,200-$2,500
* Three days away from actual work: incalculable
* Information you couldn't have Googled: approximately zero

We're not talking about some niche problem. Last year alone, the global business events industry was worth over $1 trillion. That's a staggering amount of money changing hands for content that's often indistinguishable from a decent blog post or YouTube video.

The speakers are impressive on paper. The venues are beautiful. The swag bags are... well, they exist. But when you sit down and honestly assess what *new knowledge* you've gained, the answer is often nothing. You've heard about personalization 47 times. You've seen the same case studies recycled with different company logos. You've watched ""thought leaders"" present ideas that were groundbreaking in 2019.

# Why Does This Keep Happening?

The conference industrial complex has perfected the art of appealing to the broadest possible audience, which inevitably means dumbing down to the lowest common denominator. Organizers face an impossible challenge: create content that satisfies both the intern attending their first event and the CMO with 20 years of experience.

The result? Sessions designed to offend no one and enlighten no one.

Speakers, often vendors in disguise, deliver carefully sanitized presentations that avoid anything too specific, too controversial, or too useful. Real insights require vulnerability—admitting what failed, sharing actual numbers, discussing the messy reality of implementation. But that's risky. Much safer to stick to inspiring platitudes about ""embracing change"" and ""leveraging data.""

Meanwhile, the AI revolution has made this problem exponentially worse. Why fly to Berlin to hear someone read statistics about ChatGPT adoption when you could get better, more current, more specific information from a 10-minute search?

# The Plot Twist: You're Going for the Wrong Reason

Here's where this article pivots, because despite everything I've just said, you absolutely *should* keep attending conferences.

You're just doing it wrong.

The fundamental mistake we make is treating conferences as educational events when they're actually networking infrastructures. We judge them by the stage content when we should be judging them by the hallway conversations. We evaluate ROI based on presentation slides when we should be evaluating it based on LinkedIn connections that actually respond to our messages.

The real value of a conference has nothing to do with the keynote speaker and everything to do with the person sitting next to you who's wrestling with the same problem you are.

# The Networking-First Conference Strategy

Stop attending conferences to learn. Start attending conferences to connect. This isn't just semantic wordplay—it's a fundamental shift in how you extract value from these events.

**Before the conference:**

* Research who's attending, not what's being presented
* Reach out to 10-15 people you'd like to meet
* Prepare specific questions about their work, not generic networking pleasantries
* Skip most of the agenda planning—you're not going to sit through sessions anyway

**During the conference:**

* Treat keynotes as optional unless you're genuinely interested
* Spend breaks intentionally approaching people, not hiding in your phone
* Ask about failures, not successes—that's where real insights live
* Exchange actual contact information, not just business cards destined for a drawer

**After the conference:**

* Follow up within 48 hours while you're still memorable
* Propose specific collaborations or knowledge exchanges
* Create a private Slack channel or WhatsApp group with your new connections
* Schedule actual calls to continue conversations

The irony? The people you meet through this approach are often your gateway to the insights the conference promised but failed to deliver. That CMO you had coffee with might share their actual conversion data in a private conversation. That agency founder you connected with might walk you through the campaign that flopped before they figured out what worked. That fellow marketer struggling with attribution might become a thought partner who helps you crack your own challenges.

# When Networking Transforms Into Intelligence

The most sophisticated marketers have figured this out. They treat conferences as relationship-building exercises where insights emerge organically from genuine connections rather than forced presentations.

Consider Sarah, a marketing director at a SaaS company, who stopped attending sessions entirely at a recent summit. Instead, she spent three days having intentional conversations. She met a performance marketer from a competitor who, over drinks, shared detailed insights about creative testing frameworks that tripled their conversion rate. She connected with a CMO who introduced her to an attribution tool that solved a problem she'd been wrestling with for months. She bonded with three other marketers who now form a private advisory group that meets monthly.

None of this appeared in the conference agenda. All of it was infinitely more valuable than any keynote.

The breakthrough insight here is that people you network with become your distributed intelligence network. Instead of one conference delivering limited insights to hundreds of attendees, you're creating a system where hundreds of practitioners are sharing real, specific, useful information with each other continuously.

# The Real ROI Question

Organizations should still send people to conferences, but they need to reframe success metrics entirely. Stop asking ""What did you learn?"" and start asking ""Who did you meet and what are we doing about it?""

The conference that looks like a failure by traditional metrics—boring speakers, recycled content, nothing new—might actually be your best investment if it results in three strong professional relationships that generate insights, partnerships, or opportunities over the following year.

This is why junior marketers attending their first major conference often get more value than veterans. Not because the content is revelatory to them, but because they approach networking with genuine curiosity and build relationships without agenda.

# The Conference Industry's Reckoning

Conference organizers would do well to acknowledge this reality. The future isn't bigger keynote speakers or flashier production. It's better structured networking, more intentional relationship building, and honest recognition that human connection is the product they're selling.

Some forward-thinking events are already making this shift—creating extensive matchmaking systems, designing spaces for conversation rather than presentation, facilitating small group discussions rather than lecture-style sessions. These conferences understand they're competing with YouTube and AI-powered research, and they're leaning into the one thing technology can't replicate: genuine human connection.

# Your Action Plan

The next time your company debates a conference budget, reframe the conversation. You're not paying for access to information—you're paying for access to people who have information they'd never put in a presentation.

Go to conferences with a networking-first strategy. Be intentional about connections. Follow up religiously. Build a personal network that delivers insights continuously, not just during a three-day event.

And when you inevitably find yourself sitting through another keynote about how ""AI is revolutionizing marketing,"" use that time to scan the room, identify someone interesting, and plan your approach for the coffee break.

Because that conversation in the hallway? That's where the real conference begins.

I go to meetup events and it's all guys in their 20s-30s. They're talking about TikTok trends, video games I've never heard of, shows I don't watch. I feel completely lost in conversations.



Last week I matched with a 33-year-old on an app. We met for coffee and I could tell within 10 minutes we had nothing in common. He kept referencing memes and I had no clue what he was talking about. I felt ancient.



The few men my age I DO meet are either married or not interested in dating. So my options are either stay single forever or figure out how to connect with guys 10-15 years younger who might as well be speaking another language.



I don't know how to flirt with younger guys. I don't know what they find attractive or how to keep conversations going when we have completely different cultural references. Everything I say feels outdated or awkward.



How are 40+ people supposed to date when the dating pool is mostly younger people we can't relate to? I feel like I'm too old to learn a whole new language just to have a conversation.



Anyone else dealing with this? How do you bridge that gap?",23,1765818215.0,datingoverforty,95,0.65,False

AMA about our guide to deprogramming Zionists and why we should—especially this Hanukkah","Happy Hanukkah, r/JewsOfConscience! 

We’re Beckett Mufson ([IG so you know it's real](https://instagram.com/beckettmufson)) and Imran Hafiz, former VICE journalists and longtime media strategists whose work has appeared in *The New York Times, Forbes, The Christian Science Monitor, Mic, The Mirror, National Public Radio*, and *BBC Radio*, among others. We also run a worker-owned creative agency, [The Auxiliary](https://www.theaux.agency/), and are involved in multiple Palestinian liberation organizations in Austin, TX.

https://preview.redd.it/sxl0q82wfe7g1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=889d4a71fcd5f355d34d4b00b7610d8710920b4e

We’ve written [a guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEtN6V22Wr_A2XsHncjuMOZobATCxQGf/view) to speaking with Zionists about Palestine that applies the latest advice from behavioral scientists, movement organizers, and anti-Zionist thinkers specifically to holiday gatherings. 

***For us, Hanukkah 2025 isn't a season of rest. It's a season of action. Speaking to our Zionist loved ones over the holidays may be the most significant thing we can do to free Palestine today. Here's why:***

1. With millions of Americans going home for the holidays, many anti-Zionist Jews who are normally distant will be in a room with their Zionist relatives. 

2. If enough of us help the Zionists in our lives to recognize the genocide, we have a shot at making anti-Zionism the undeniable mainstream of American Judaism. 

3. This would undermine the chokehold Zionist lobbies like AIPAC and the ADL have on the American politicians who deliver the U.S. veto against UN Security Council motions that might hold Israel accountable.

4. Israel quadrupled its ""public diplomacy"" budget for 2026, and [reports indicate](https://youtu.be/qy-oBRsTqYY?si=3qTFhtdDGFjFx5NR) they intend to ramp up Islamophobia to muddy the waters as more Americans condemn their genocide.

Israel spends billions on propaganda because it delivers strategic value. They are paying influencers $7,000 *per video* to spread their message, supported by bot armies, while we work on donations. Their weakness is that we have the truth on our side. Our plan uses culture and behavioral science to make use of that advantage over the holiday season. 

It all starts with everyday Jews of Conscience, but many of us have given up. We feel like reasoning with Zionists is impossible. And it turns out, *we’re right*. 

But that doesn’t mean we can’t persuade them. It just means we can’t do it with reason alone. That’s why we made [The Zionism Deprogamming Guide - Holiday Edition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HEtN6V22Wr_A2XsHncjuMOZobATCxQGf/view). 

Ask us anything about:

* Why it’s hard to reason with Zionists
* How to tactfully bring up Palestine at a holiday gathering
* Why talking to your Zionist loved ones is probably the most impactful thing you could do to help free Palestine
* The task of deprogramming Zionism
* How we made this guide and our design philosophy
* What it’s been like to witness this genocide as a Jew and a Muslim living and working together
* Our relationship in general
* How you can help! In particular, we are looking for support with:
   * PR
   * Graphic design (even basic knowledge of Canva would be great!)
   * Social media strategy
   * Fundraising
   * Access to psychographic/social listening tools
   * Book publishing
   * Speaking engagements
   * Video editing

We hope you will read the guide, share it (with at least 5 people who may be interested), and use it during the holidays.

Why should you care what we have to say about this? Here’s a bit of background info about us:

I was walking home from a club meeting from a restaurant where the meeting was at. For context, it was the first meeting of the year.

We walked past each other on the sidewalk. I think he was heading to the meeting event, and he stopped and asked me if he had seen me at a lecture before. I said no, I don’t recognize him. And then we made small talk. He was being polite, but for some reason, I felt uncomfortable. He asked me which food I recommended at the restaurant. He asked to trade Instagrams, so I did. He asked to hang out, and I declined and said I was busy with school. He said okay, God bless you, and we said goodbye and left.

I looked on his Instagram, and he reposted things about religion, promiscuity, abortions, and other things about politics, like Jesus hand wrestling the Devil, where the North Korea/China/Russia flags were on Jesus’s side, and the U.S. flag, Israel, and a transgender flag with the Nato symbol on top of it(?) was on the Devil’s side. He also reposted something about Jesus not being a pacifist, and other religious/political content.

I think everyone is entitled to their beleifs, and this does not make him a bad person. He was nice, but I didn’t agree with some of the things he reposted, and felt a little uncomfortable.

The next day, I get a text from him thanking me for recommending a food. He then asked if I would be down to hangout and get coffee/lunch sometime next week, “Just as friends of course :)”. I said it was nice talking to him too, but I have a lot going outside of school, I don’t think I can meet up, but hope to see him around the club. He responded graciously again, and that was that. I didn’t go to any more club meetings because I wasn’t interested in the club. I didn’t block him because I didn’t want to be mean.

A couple weeks later, we bumped into each other again. He made small talk, asked to hang out again, and I said no I’m busy with classes. He asked me which classes I was taking, and I said Ochem, Physics, and African-American history for a GE. He said, “African-American history? I feel like there are a lot more interesting histories, like European or Asian.” I asked “why,” but my voice was quiet and soft because I was scared of sounding confrontational, so I don’t think he heard me. Then, there was this long silence. Suddenly, he laughed and said he thought the Sun was in my eyes, and I laughed nervously and agreed because it was in my eyes during the whole conversation. Then I left.

Then, one month later, he messaged me again, saying that since finals are over he’s going to be free and was wondering if we should go get coffee together, hoping my finals weren’t too brutal. I said “hi, hope your finals were good too, I’m not available to meet up and won’t be making plans, thanks for understanding”, then I blocked him.

I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's ""busy"" schedule and latest complaints.  

Takeout & Shopping 

11/22 Domino's Pizza for dinner

11/23 Taco Bell lunch for 2; Car Wash for both vehicles (she doxxed herself)

11/24 Bones Coffee The Nightmare Before Christmas Collectors Box Set for Kylea

11/25 Dutch Bros for Kylea; TikTok: Gingerbread T-shirt for Kylea; Target: Dash Everyday Griddle for Joe; Dollar General: Gingerbread themed disposable plates, napkins, cups for Christmas breakfast; Kylea clarified in a comment that since she and Joe buy things for each other throughout the year, they normally don't get each other Christmas gifts

11/26 Takeout for dinner from unknown restaurant; Unknown bakery delivered 4 pies to their apartment

11/27 TikTok: Funny Merry & Bright Couples Sweatshirts for Kylea & Joe

Travel

There were multiple references about their holiday plans.

11/25 Kylea started packing for her Dec trips

Pets, Family & Religion

11/22 Kylea claimed she and Joe will take turns going to dinner with her parents during their Dec Branson trip. 

11/23 Claimed ""kids"" spent the night and she woke up to the sound of laughter and cartoons. They skipped in-person and online church

11/24 Started buying items for Christmas breakfast, even though Joe works at a grocery store

11/27 They won't spend time with her dad's side of the family (as previously planned) due to her not feeling well.  After hyping up Thanksgiving for weeks, no images were shared of her mom's table decorations or the spread of food...just an image of Kylea's plate of food and dessert. 

\*No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk or playing with her puzzles/ball pit. Alice was not shown in pictures or video

Health & Fitness: 

11/22 Kylea & Joe are pausing meal planning dinners for Dec and the first few weeks of Jan due to their busy schedules

11/23 Joe was at the gym from 11pm-1am this morning due to Thanksgiving plans: Two videos posted of them dancing in the living room

11/24 Kylea claimed she had an early morning therapy appt 1 hour away and shopped at Dillons after.  She did this without her ESA; Dancing video in living room

11/25 She rested more today to prepare for Thanksgiving this week; Backache and headache began in afternoon, she set the thermostat to 76 degrees and took a bath

11/26 Her headache is worse when out of bed and walking around.  She sat in the Bronco for the seat warmers to help her back, has nausea, took multiple baths and Joe picked up dinner.  The bakery delivered the pies since she wasn't feeling well.  (Why didn't she or Joe pick them up when they were out and about today?)

11/27 Joe cleaned and put up all the Christmas decor while she rested

11/28 Revealed she went to the ER last night (on a holiday without her ESA), was there 5 hours, they ran many tests and found nothing major going on.  She received fluids for dehydration, doesn't have COVID or a UTI. She now has a fever and has been drinking Gatorade, Sprite Zero, water and almost no coffee; Dancing video of Joe in the living room

\*No videos of Joe at the gym were shared; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared on Facebook showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate.

Final Thoughts

Everyone should always use their best judgement on whether a medical issue warrants a trip to Urgent Care or the ER.  I find it \*interesting\* how Kylea becomes ill before events she's hyped for weeks/months, when she knows she won't be the center of attention and/or her engagement is down.  She downplayed the fact she went through a stressful 5ish hour experience alone, without her ESA.  Is that not a therapy breakthrough?  Does this not make her feel she could be away from Birdie long enough to get the hysterectomy she speaks about?  She should talk to her therapist about that ASAP. ✌️

These things I'm mentioning are limited to the kitchen so you can imagine how they are with everything else in the home.. 

  They are stirring their coffee with the sugar spoon then putting the sugar spoon back into the sugar bowl. I bought it up to them that this isn't how it's done and they need to stir the coffee with something else..

 Blows my mind, but, as I've gotten older I'm expecting less and less of people so, I'm not too surprised.

1pncgkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hellenism_Paganism/comments/1pncgkj/new_to_hekate_need_help/,"New to Hekate, Need Help","Greetings,

I come to this community with humility and a need for grounding perspective. I am very new to all of this. Until recently, I was an atheist, but a series of events has compelled me to seek understanding here, where practice is taken seriously.

For over a year, I experienced a peculiar and constant sensitivity to spiders in my home, feeling their presence unmistakably. A month ago, I began to deeply question my atheism.

Then, two weeks ago, the phenomena became direct and sequential:

1. I heard a crow call where I never had before.
2. I offered a simple, spoken prayer to Hekate.
3. The next morning, I woke speaking the word “crossroads” aloud, followed by an irresistible urge to go to one, where I left a garlic clove.
4. A family member, entirely unaware, read my coffee grounds. She described my actions (building an altar), stated a protective presence was watching me, and said: “a door you have kept locked will open.”
5. When I sought a key for an altar, my grandmother specified one. It is stamped with the brand name “Tri-Circle.”

I have established a small, humble shrine with this key, garlic, lavender, and a pebble. I am attempting to approach this with the respect it demands through daily, quiet acknowledgment.

My questions for this community are:

1. From a Hellenic perspective, how might such a rapid and tangible sequence of events be understood? Is there a concept for a ""calling"" that is this immediate and evidenced?
2. My practice is currently bare and personal. What are the first, most respectful steps in building kharis with Hekate from this starting point?
3. Could you recommend essential historical or scholarly resources on Hekate's worship that would help me contextualize this personal experience within tradition?
4. Any advice on grounding such an intense personal revelation into a sustainable, reverent daily practice?

I am not interested in eclectic magic, but in understanding this through the lens of respectful, reciprocal devotion. Thank you for any guidance you can offer.",1,1765817714.0,Hellenism_Paganism,0,1.0,False

TLDR:   
Using less coffee in a 6-cup moka pot causes low back pressure and bad brews. Fix it by placing **one wet Aeropress paper filter** at the bottom of the collector filter plate. Use **15 g coffee with full water (≈290 ml)**, let it brew and lightly sputter — it self-dilutes and gives a consistent, great cup with zero babysitting.

  
I wanted to share a small trick that has completely fixed my inconsistent brews when using a **6-cup moka pot for just one person**.

**Problem:**  
My 6-cup Budan moka pot needs \~30 g coffee to properly fill the funnel.  
But when I brew only for myself, I use **14–16 g**.

With less coffee in the funnel:

* There isn’t enough back pressure
* Water rushes through unevenly
* Result = weak, bitter, inconsistent cups every time

**Solution (simple but effective):**  
I placed **one Aeropress paper filter (WET, not dry)** at the **bottom of the collector filter plate** (between the funnel and the top chamber).

This single wet paper:

* Adds the missing resistance/back pressure
* Compensates for the half-filled funnel
* Makes extraction far more even

The difference was immediate — cleaner, better and more consistent coffee.

**Water part (important):**  
Normally:

* 6-cup moka pot → \~290 ml water (till safety valve)
* Full funnel → \~150–170 ml strong concentrate, later diluted

For **15 g coffee**, I initially tried reducing water — bad results.

What worked best instead:

* **Keep full 290 ml water in water chamber**
* Coffee Funnel only half-filled (15 g)
* Let it brew past steady flow and allow sputtering because of the filter paper, even sputtering is less violent.  
* The extra water naturally dilutes the brew inside the chamber

End result = **perfect strength without manual dilution**

**Why I like this method:**  
I’ve used Aeropress daily for \~2 years, and honestly this moka method is even simpler:

1. Grind
2. Add coffee & water
3. Add wet filter paper
4. Put on stove
5. Walk away, come back in \~4 minutes

Pour and enjoy ☕

No fancy ratios, no stirring, no babysitting.

Sharing in case it helps anyone else who owns a bigger moka pot but brews only for themselves.

A family portrait I’d snapped for my ex-husband and his family went viral on my social media feed.

Everyone was speculating what kind of stunt I, the women they all call “unhinged”, was about to pull this time.

After all, five years ago, in a desperate bid to keep my ex-husband, I’d agreed to walk away from our marriage with nothing. I’d even landed myself in jail through my reckless actions, ruining a promising career as a top-tier lawyer—all of it had been laid bare for the world to see.

And still, he’d remained as cold as stone. The very next day after our divorce, he married a woman seven years his junior.

This time, though, I didn’t throw tantrums, sob, or threaten suicide. Instead, I’d set up a food stall near campus and started selling crepes.

My first customer stood in front of the stall for ten minutes without uttering a single word.

It wasn’t until I pulled down my mask and smiled at him that I spoke,

“Long time no see, Xavier.”

“Want a crepe?”

Xavier finally spoke, his voice low and heavy.

“I thought you’d pretend not to recognize me.”

I twitched the corner of my mouth, but the smile didn’t reach my eyes.

“what’s the point?”

“What are you doing selling food here?”

“To make a living,” I replied flatly. “A person’s gotta survive, right?”

I had done all kinds of odd jobs over the years just to get by. Even when he’d tried to cut off all my options by blacklisting me from the entire industry, I’d scraped by with side gigs here and there.

He let out a soft sigh. “You could barely even cook a simple bowl of noodle soup back then. How do you manage this?”

The lunch bell rang, and a flood of students poured out of the campus.

A student ran over, sounding familiar, “Elena! One crepe with ham, please!”

I acknowledged them and cracked an egg expertly. The batter sizzled on the griddle, and with a flick of my wrist, I spread it into a perfect circle.

Xavier watched my smooth, practiced movements, his eyes clouded with a strange look of bewilderment.

The students swarmed around the stall, chattering eagerly.

“Elena, are you helping Mrs. Margaret run the stall again today?”

I nodded.

Mrs. Margaret was a client I’d taken on pro bono; she relied on this little stall to raise her granddaughter. Over the years, I’d helped one person like her after another. I hadn’t made much money, but I’d picked up a whole slew of skills along the way.

The line of customers grew longer, weaving through the crowd. Amid the hustle and bustle, Xavier was jostled out of sight.

By the time I packed up the stall, I’d assumed he’d left long ago. As usual, I headed to my coffee shop, and ordered a single-origin coffee.

A familiar male voice sounded behind me.

“I’ll have what she’s having.”

Xavier sat down across from me, automatically nudged the sugar caddy closer to my side of the table—an old habit. He hesitated for a moment before asking, “How have you been… all these years?”

“Fine. Pretty good, actually,” I said, my tone neutral.

The campus coffee shop was full of students, and quite a few recognized him.

“Mr. Xavier!”

“Professor!”

Greetings came from all sides.

It was plain to see how successful and prominent he’d become—especially compared to me, looking plain to the point of shabbiness.

“When did you get back to Crestwood City?”

“A month ago.”

He paused. “The day you took that photo for us.”

I didn’t deny it.

I’d never imagined the world could be this small. No sooner had I returned than I’d run into him and his family of three. And I’d certainly never thought a quick, offhand family portrait—taken before I’d even gotten a clear look at their faces—would blow up my old social media feed, even becoming the subject of bets among our former acquaintances.

“Lila didn’t mean to post that photo,” he said. “Those people are just talking nonsense—don’t pay them any mind.”

I shook my head. “I don’t have time for that kind of nonsense.”

He fell silent for a moment, then lowered his voice, “If you need help, I could—”

I cut him off. “I don’t. I’m doing just fine.”

It was the truth. But Xavier seemed convinced I was putting on a brave face.

He frowned and raised his voice, “It’s been five years, Elena. When are you going to move on? Is this… this… some kind of punishment? To make me feel guilty?”

Through the wispy steam rising from our mugs, I stared at the still young, handsome face in front of me. I could barely recall the cold, detached expression he wore five years ago, when he’d forced me to sign the divorce papers.

I looked away. “I let go a long time ago.”

“You…”

Our coffee arrived, cutting off whatever Xavier had been about to say.

Mr. Tony, the shop owner, grinned at us.

“Well, look who it is! You two haven’t been here in years, have you?”

Xavier stiffened.

I kept my expression calm. “You’ve got the wrong people.”

“That can’t be right! I get hundreds of customers, but you two were always so inseparable—I’d never forget!” Tony scratched his head and muttered as he walked away.

Xavier turned to me. “Why did you deny it? This was our spot—we used to come here all the time when we were dating.”

I kept drinking my coffee, not looking up.

“Was it? I don’t remember.”

Abruptly, he stood up and walked over to a community photo wall. After searching for a long moment, he pulled one out, his face lighting up with joy.

“See? This is us—”

His voice trailed off, and he quickly tucked the photo back, but I’d already seen it.

In the yellowed picture, Xavier sat to my left, his arm slung affectionately around my neck. And to my right, a shy, delicate girl was holding gently onto the sleeve of my sweater gently—it was Lila, his wife now.

In the blurry date stamp at the bottom left of the photo, it read exactly six years ago today.

Chapter 2

I was seven years older than Xavier.

The year we met, I’d returned to my alma mater as a guest speaker, and he was the student representative asking questions during the Q&A.

I remember his eyes—sharp, blazing with ambition.

Even in a faded button-down, he couldn’t hide the raw edge of youth.

At the end of the talk, he stopped me bold as anything.

Said he’d listened to every public lecture I’d given, that I was the goal he strove for.

Back then, suitors had never been in short supply, and I’d grown used to the calculated pleasantries of corporate life.

His unguarded admiration, fiery and sincere, actually made my heart skip a beat.

But I turned him down gently all the same.

Xavier was far too young—this was likely just a passing fancy.

I never could have guessed what came next.

It was a pursuit so fervent, it bordered on obsession.

Xavier’s family wasn’t well-off, yet he’d skip meals for weeks to buy me huge bouquets of roses.

He’d wait for me outside my office building late into the night, just to hand me a bowl of homemade hangover soup after a business dinner.

No matter how many times I rejected him, he never gave up.

Then came the day I nearly fell victim to workplace harassment.

Xavier had gotten into a fight to protect me, risking his entire future in the process.

I’d snapped at him, hurling the harshest words I could muster in my panic.

But his eyes had lit up like stars as he grabbed my hand.

“When I, Xavier, set my mind on something, I see it through to the end, even if it breaks me,” he’d said.

“Elena, I love you. Even if you reject me a thousand times, I will still love you the thousand and first time.”

I finally relented.

For the sake of that young, unwavering devotion, I gambled everything I had.

My parents didn’t understand, my friends tried to talk me out of it—everyone thought we’d never last.

I had my moments of doubt, too.

But Xavier kept every promise he’d made.

At his graduation ceremony, he proposed to me in front of everyone.

Elena,” he said, “I’ll spend the rest of my life proving you didn’t make a mistake.”

After we married, I used all my connections and resources to pave his way in the legal world.

And he proved worthy of it, in just a few short years, he’d made a name for himself in the legal world and started his own firm.

To the outside world, he was a prominent attorney—but with me, he was still clingy, possessive to a fault.

At Xavier’s insistent request, I left my position at the big law firm.

I also wanted to chase my ideals more purely, to help vulnerable groups.

It was during that time that I met Lila.

Her lawsuit against her father for domestic violence had ended in defeat.

Right outside the courthouse, the fragile girl had been dragged along the ground by her hair.

I’d rushed forward to stop him.

I took the punches meant for her and ended up in the hospital.

Xavier was furious, but I insisted on helping Lila.

She had nowhere to go, terrified her father would take revenge, so I invited her to move in with us.

She was so grateful she started calling me her sister.

At first, Xavier was cold to her at first, constantly picking arguments, jealous of the time I spent with her.

That changed when I asked Xavier to take over Lila’s case.

Once he delved deeper into the details, his prejudice faded, and he came to see just how truly helpless she was.

For a while, the three of us shared meals and traveled together.

I never doubted a single person’s sincerity.

Little did I know how quickly a person’s heart could change.

The truth came crashing down on my thirty-third birthday.

I’d cut a business trip short to head home early.

By the front door, Xavier’s leather belt lay discarded next to the little white dress I’d bought Lila.

Through the crack in the bedroom door, suggestive glow seeped out, along with unrestrained gasps and moans.

My world shattered the second I pushed that door open.

I grabbed a paperweight from the desk and hurled it at them.

“Xavier, are you even human? Lila’s only nineteen!”

But Lila had lifted her tear-streaked face from his arms, saying, “Elena, I came to him willingly. We love each other, truly.”

My heart was so broken my voice turned hoarse. “What about me? What am I supposed to do?”

Xavier wrapped Lila tightly in the covers.

After the initial shock, his face had gone cold—a chilling calm.

He rose from the bed with deliberate slowness and lifted my chin.

“You know it too,” he said. “Lila’s nineteen. But you? Elena, you’re thirty-three.”

His gaze raked over me, a cruel laugh escaping him. “Haven’t you noticed the fine lines around your eyes are getting harder to hide?”

“When we walk down the street together, people think I’m your boy toy.”

My hands shook with rage.

“Xavier, did my age suddenly become news to you?”

“If you resented it so much, why didn’t you say something sooner?”

Xavier’s smile dropped. “You’re right. You have done nothing wrong. But you have become tedious, Elena.”

“Lila’s young. Alive. She knows how to admire me, to need me.”

“Just like you used to love the young me, once upon a time, isn’t that right?”

I listened to his words and laughed, even as tears streamed down my face.

“Fine… fine… we’re getting a divorce!”

But he frowned, shaking his head. “Divorce? I’m not divorcing you. Not yet, at least.”

“Consider it,” he paused, “honoring the promises I made you back then.”

Chapter 3

I couldn’t swallow this half-cooked mess of life any more than I could digest their betrayal.

On the first day after discovering their affair, I posted intimate photos of Xavier and Lila in a professional legal network. They were deleted quickly, but not before they sparked a firestorm of gossip.

The next day, I threw Lila’s luggage out the front door right in front of Xavier.

“Get out,” I said.

Lila burst into tears, clinging to Xavier’s sleeve.

Xavier gave me an icy stare and made a call.

Half an hour later, every single one of my bank accounts was frozen.

By the third day, I tracked down the biggest client of his law firm and told them about his misconduct. The client promised to reconsider their collaboration.

That night, Xavier stumbled home smelling of whiskey.

He gripped my neck and forced me against the table.

There, displayed before me, lay the client's newly signed three-year contract. “Is that all you’ve got, Elena?” he mocked.

He was right.

To climb higher, he’d stop at nothing—and I truly was no match for his ruthlessness.

So I’d gathered evidence and filed a formal, named complaint against his firm for tax irregularities.

I’d also gone to Lila’s academic advisor at her college and laid out the facts objectively.

But the only thing I’d gotten in return was an investigation into my bar license, which was suspended pending investigation.

When I’d stormed into his office to confront him, he’d been feeding Lila cherries.

“Enough, Elena,” he’d said, dabbing the juice from the corner of Lila’s mouth with his thumb.

“If you bother Lila again, I can’t promise you’ll ever practice law again.”

In that moment, a crushing sense of powerlessness washed over me.

I’d finally realized just how vast the gulf was between Xavier now and myself.

“Elena?”

A saccharine voice jolted me back to the present.

Lila was standing by the table, I hadn’t even noticed her approach.

Lila stood beside our table, one hand resting on her slightly rounded stomach. She was dressed head to toe in designer clothes, her makeup flawless, her cheeks rosy with health.

It was clear she’d been well taken care of.

“It really is you! I almost didn’t recognize you—I thought you were one of the coffee shop staff,” she’d said, feigning surprise.

I stared at her, saying nothing.

“What are you doing these days? I heard you’re working at a food stall now,” she’d continued, her tone dripping with fake sympathy. “You were the golden girl of the law school once. How did you end up like this?”

Xavier frowned. “Lila.”

“Oh, I’m just asking out of concern!” she’d whined, shaking his arm playfully.

“We’re all old friends, right? No need to be so serious.”

I gave a faint, ironic smile. “Can people who share a history of bloodshed really be called friends?”

The atmosphere froze the second the words left my mouth.

Five years earlier, just as Xavier and I had been locked in a bitter battle that left both of us exhausted, another nightmare had struck.

My mother, a surgeon, had been stabbed by the family of a patient who’d accused her of medical disputes.

When I’d raced to the hospital, in panic, I’d found Xavier shielding a trembling Lila tightly in his arms.

“It’s okay,” he’d been comforting her. “It’s not your fault. You’re a victim too…”

That’s when I’d learned the attacker was Lila’s father.

He’d beaten Lila’s mother to death in a fit of domestic violence, then blamed the doctor for her death.

Xavier and Lila had been there when he stabbed my mother—witnessing the whole thing unfold.

I’d broken down sobbing.

Xavier hesitated for a moment, then placed a hand on my shoulder.

“Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you win this lawsuit.”

I took Lila’s father to court.

But when we’d needed a witness to testify, Lila had vanished.

All she’d left was a message filled with fake remorse: [Elena, I’m so sorry. But he’s my dad. I just can’t do it.]

The case had been dismissed for lack of evidence, and my mother had been found liable for surgical negligence.

She faded away in agony and died brokenhearted.

At her funeral, Lila had shown up, crying harder than anyone else.

“I’m sorry, Elena. I’m so sorry…”

I slapped her hard across the face.

Then I lunged at her, choking her neck while screaming, “Why did I ever save you? Give me back my mother!”

Xavier thrown me off her so hard. I stumbled and fell against my mother’s marble headstone.

“Have you lost your mind, Elena? Lila’s innocent too!” he roared.

My whole body trembled. “What about me? What about my mom?”

“Why do good people never get the peace they deserve?”

Xavier had stared at me coldly.

To stop me from hurting Lila in my rage, he’d called the police.

I’d been arrested and detained on assault charges.

When he’d come to visit me in jail, he’d brought a divorce paper with him.

“Elena, sign this. Then we are even.”

My heart had turned to ash as I flipped through the pages.

“…You want me to walk away with nothing?” I’d whispered.

Xavier had pulled out photos of my house, covered in graffiti with threatening messages scrawled across the walls.

“Lila lost her mother because of your mother’s surgical mistake,” he’d stated calmly.

“I don’t want you to live with guilt. This money is compensation for her.”

“And when you get out…” He’d sighed. “Make sure you arrange your Mom’s funeral properly.”

Tears had splattered onto the paper as I read his words.

In that instant, every vow, every promise Xavier had ever made to me, shattered into dust.

I’d signed the paper, giving him exactly what he wanted.

Chapter 4

“We never imagined things would turn out so hard for you,” Xavier said, drawing in a deep breath before pulling a credit card out of his wallet.

“Take it. Consider it compensation. The PIN is your birthday.”

Lila’s smile tightened momentarily before she forced a smile.

“Elena, you really don’t have to treat us like enemies,” she said.

“Besides, you’re not like me—I have Xavier to take care of me. A woman your age can’t make it easy living alone…”

“I’m not alone,” I cut her off, pushing Xavier’s card away.

As my sleeve slid up, a diamond wedding band glinted in the light.

“I’m married. And I’m doing great now.”

Both of them looked stunned.

But Lila was the first to smooth her expression over.

“Oh, really? Congratulations, then, Elena,” she said, her eyes darting sideways. “So your husband now…?”

Just then, my phone screen lit up.

It was a barrage of urgent messages—someone demanding I come home.

I declined the call and fired off a reply, speaking casually without looking up. “He’s two years older than me.”

Lila’s tone turned loaded. “Oh? I thought you only had a thing for younger men, Elena.”

“Enough!” Xavier’s face darkened.

He fixed me with a disappointed gaze. “Elena, do you really have to throw your life away like this?”

“Marrying an older guy and selling crepes to support him?”

“Is this the life you wanted?”

“Don’t you forget—you were once a rising star in the legal world!”

I hit send on my text, then lifted my gaze to meet Xavier’s.

“Xavier, you’re out of line.”

He blinked, caught off guard. “I just… I want what’s best for you.”

“Don’t bother,” I said coolly. “Because I want you to be miserable.”

I turned my eyes to both of them, my voice steady.

“And I never forgave either of you,” I added.

“I just refused to waste my precious life tangled up with two people who aren't worth another thought like you.”

“I’ve already paid the bill. I’m leaving.”

With that, I turned and walked away without a second glance.

Behind me, I heard the sound of their hushed, angry argument.

“Xavier, what’s your deal? Are you trying to get back with that old hag?!”

“Lila, are you out of your mind? Stop calling her that! She’s like your sister!”

“And you were like my brother-in-law once! Don’t you forget it was you who came to my bed first back then…”

“Shut up. Go home. Now.”

I walked on without pausing, making straight for the exit. It was late afternoon, and the sidewalks were filled with people of all ages, hurrying by.

Time remains the fairest judge..

No one got to keep their youth forever.

And when good looks faded, what's left beneath was often an ugly truth.

As soon as I stepped outside the café, I heard rapid footsteps chasing after me.

Xavier caught up again, grabbing my arm.

“Elena, just listen to me…” he panted, his eyes shining in the glow of the setting sun.

“When you left back then, I actually…”

He was cut off as a clear, childish voice called out behind us.

“Mommy!”

I sat in a coffee shop, trying to be normal, trying to enjoy the quiet. And then I looked to my left and saw a store name that made my chest sink. It took me a second to place it, and then I realized why it felt so familiar... it was the same store where you once went to sell your Chrome Hearts clothes.

I didn’t expect that memory to hit me. It was such a random detail from your life, something I never thought would matter this much later on. But suddenly, there you were again. Clear as day. Standing in my head like you never left.

And then, as if the universe wanted to make sure I didn’t miss you enough already, Ocean Eyes started playing in the background.

That song.

The one that always makes everything feel softer and sadder at the same time. The kind of song that doesn’t shout, but quietly breaks you. I tried to stay present, tried to focus on my coffee, but my mind drifted back to you, to us, to the version of me that still believed we were going somewhere.

Today, I miss you more than usual.

Not in a dramatic, crying-all-day way. Just this heavy, dull ache that sits in your chest when you’re reminded that someone who once felt like home is now just a memory you bump into in random places. A store name. A song. A quiet afternoon.

I keep wondering if you ever think of me too. If something small ever reminds you of us. If a song ever catches you off guard. If I ever cross your mind the way you crossed mine today.

I know I can’t control that. I know missing someone doesn’t mean they miss you back. But today, I really wish you did.

I wish I wasn’t the only one carrying these moments. I wish I wasn’t the only one feeling this.

A time when I was young, strong willed, and rebellious and yes, stupid. Something traumatic had happened in my life. Can you believe it? Something I thought was so traumatic then doesn't even hold a tiny space in my memory bank now. To this day, it is just an insignificant piece of nothingness. But what I do remember clearly is what I said and it haunts me all these years later. I recall a friend telling me that whatever had happened was all part of God's plan. Rebellious me looked at her and said ""Well I can take it! Go ahead, God, hit me with your best shot. I'm strong, I can take it, you can't break me!"" My friend was totally aghast. She replied, ""NEVER say that! How could you challenge God? You have to apologize, ask for forgiveness. You will pay for what you said!""

I was newly married, and we were trying to conceive. The doctors told me it was medically impossible for me to have a child. We were heartbroken. But then one day I found out I was pregnant. A gift from God. She was born special needs but we didn't care. She was God's gift, and she has brought so much joy into our lives.

I lost my Grandpa. He meant the world to me. I was from his only daughter of 5 children; she was his little girl. I was the only daughter of 6 children and I was his princess. He looked so forward to me having a baby and he hoped it would be a girl, another princess in his life. He died suddenly 2 months before she was born. I was more than heartbroken and I still grieve for him. And I'm sad for our daughter for not having the chance to meet her great grandpa who loved her before she was even born.

I found my way back to my faith in God and tried to live by his word. But I never gave a second thought to my words from years past.

Aside from my husband, my mom was my dearest friend in the world. I lost her. She was only 62 when she died from an aggressive incurable cancer. I was there holding her hand as she took her final breath. The pain of losing her was beyond words.

And then I lost my nephew to leukemia at the age of 16.

I lost my dad. We had always been extremely close. I was his little girl. He was my hero. After my mom died he was introduced to someone, a widow who had recently lost her elderly husband. She was just looking for companionship, someone who understood what she was going through, to talk with over a cup of coffee. NOT. She was only a few years older than me. And she convinced him that she loved him. She took him away, out of state because that was her dream, to have another home in another state. He went out of retirement and back to work to buy her that home. She deleted phone messages left for him from his family so he wouldn't know. She screened his calls and threw away letters so he wouldn't even know he received them. She isolated him from his family. And then he died. His new wife (supposedly) had always considered me her competition. And she despised me for having found a rare opportunity to speak to him and tell him that I'd been calling him, leaving messages, sending him letter. He never knew. To remind me that she had full control over him, she banned me from the hospital. The staff would not let me into his room per her wishes. I didn't get to hold his hand and tell him I loved him. I didn't get to say goodbye.

I lost a brother to cancer. He suffered a slow painful death as is often the case with cancer. He was only 51.

I lost another brother to cancer. An aggressive cancer that quickly took his life. He had finally gotten through the troubled life he led, found the love of his life and was happy for maybe the first time in his entire adult life. He was only 61.

Our precious daughter, about 12 years old, albeit at a biological age of 39, had a stroke and was diagnosed with a very rare progressive cerebrovascular disease as the cause.

Through it all, my husband, the love of my life, the person who made me whole, was my rock. He held me, he comforted me, he gave me strength. He passed away almost two years ago, and I can't recover from the pain of losing him. I am as shattered and broken today as I was the day I lost him. I continue to live only because our precious daughter needs me.

And my mind goes back to and just hangs on to those words I spoke so many years ago, when I was young, strong, rebellious and yes, stupid; ""Go ahead, hit me with your best shot, you can't break me.""  And I now believe that my loved ones have paid the price for those words.

I'm here just to say, God, I was wrong. I'm sorry. I was stupid. I beg your forgiveness. You've broken me. I'm shattered beyond words. I'll never forgive myself, and I'll forever live with the guilt, and the regret and the grief that I deserve. Please bless our precious daughter with a long happy life. Please don't make her pay for my stupid mistake. I'm already broken beyond repair.",6,1765817250.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

Why?","I have a client who recently graduated from college. During a recent tutoring session, she began crying as soon as she connected (like full-blown meltdown) and she told me she just found out her boyfriend was sleeping with other women.

I don't have any interest towards her (or any of my student, for that matter) so I suggested she download Tinder or Bumble and try to meet new people.

Anyways, she's a really private person so previously, when she took trips, she just said ""I'll be out of town on travel from.."" and I just said OK. A couple weeks after the session where she cried, she began to tell me during session that she was traveling to Bangkok (from Boston) with her friends. I found that very odd as Bangkok was the last place I'd imagine she'd visit (she's not a party-er at all, etc.).

I just said OK and moved on, almost pretending I didn't hear, because I didn't want to be seen like I was interested in her. But she continued to mention that she was coming to Bangkok and I continued to just respond OK. I thought it would be cool to may be grab coffee or something since she was coming all the way from Boston but I didn't ask (I was waiting for her to ask to meet).

Anyways, the days when she's visiting Bangkok come and silence. I thought it would be super awkward so I finally emailed her if she wanted to grab coffee or something. She's usually the type to respond within 20 minutes to emails but this time, silence again. She wrote to me several days later saying she was now back in the States and wanted to resume tutoring sessions.

I didn't reply to her as I felt humiliated -- but finally wrote to her asking ""if you don't feel safe even grabbing coffee with me, how can you possibly learn from me? Do you think I'm going to kidnap or harass you or something?"" I've been losing a lot of clients due to my temper (I flare up easily and send angry emails). I'm afraid I've lost another one.

Why do you think the client continuously reminded me she was visiting Bangkok but actually declined coffee invite when she arrived?

Girls who are into me don't.

I'm 26M and am stuck in a bit of a dilemma.

I am currently dating a girl who is quite a bit younger than me (20), however it works out since i'm still in college as well. We vibe alright, she is stunning, we have similar values and our dates have been very good so far.

I also had a girlfriend some time ago (few months older than me) however we broke it off due to the LTR not working out, eventhough she was head over heels for me.

Between them i dated another girl who was also quite nice, however our convos were a bit stale later on, she had some family issues and ultimately some insecurities because of which she broke it off. She, as well as my only real girlfriend came back some time later asking whether i still loved them, or in the second case apologizing and asking me to try again, but i was nontheless feeling quite hurt that they didn't give me a chance to talk over whatever issues we had before and so i both times said i didn't want to try again.

The issue with all of these is that today i was thinking about a handful of girls (let's call them Group B for writing ease) i met through various means. Largely via friends or youth groups. There was a stark contrast between those girls and the girls above who i am actually dating/was in a relationship with, when it comes to how much of a ""friend"" we were apart from the dating and love aspect of the relationship, and how much we had in common.

I am nerdy when it comes to a few things. I know it's probably unlikely to find a girl willing to listen to me ramble on about aviation accidents and my crush on the Lockheed L-1011 all day, but all of the Group B girls i talked endlessly about fantasy novels, about art or creativity, about hiking and camping which i absolutely love, some of them were into gaming, others were into Korean/Japanese culture which i also appreciate (eventhough i'm not that big of an anime guy) and talking to them was like talking with by best guy friend.

However i never managed to get the impression any of the Group B girls wanted to go out with me or pursue something more than just friendship. When i suggested meeting for a coffee or something, rarely did anything come out of it.

You might say they didn't want a relationship or felt that i was using the hobbies or something to get into their pants, but i was genuine in my interests and i feel, if anything, that i thought feelings could potentially develop naturally this way. Not mentioning that all of the girls, except one culturally muslim girl, were Christian as well, and from the places we met it was pretty clear we wanted to wait until marriage.

With the girls i am actually dating i feel as if i can't be myself really. I mean i can, in a way, but i know that something is missing which could have been there from the Group B girls that i have actually met.

I want to be in a relationship with a woman that i love inside and out, and which basically feels like my closest friend as well. Am i the only one who thinks this? Is this something women don't want that maybe i wasn't aware of?

I am slightly insecure, am a bit shy and only recently gained a bit of confidence after i started dressing much much better and realized that many girls do actually think i'm pretty cute starting about 2-3 years ago. (Still, i fumbled hard in the beginning because i misidentified playful teasing as some women making fun of me, only for me to later learn that they were actually into me.)

The girl i'm currently dating is thankfully genuinely one of the sweetest people i have met. She reads a lot (however sadly no fantasy, sci-fi or action stuff haha), is very attentive, extremely gorgeous and also responding to romance and sharing her feelings. I really want this to work out and believe we can have a great relationship that will develop into something even deeper the more time we spend together. But i am a bit scared there will be some things i won't ever be able to share with her. Not that i'll hide them, just that she won't really participate in them out of her own volition if you know what i mean.

It's not a dealbreaker of course, but i sometimes do wonder why it didn't work with the girls it could have been even deeper from the start.",1,1765817124.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Starting over when you’re single in your late 30s hits different.

We’re not clueless anymore.  
We’re self-aware. We’ve built boundaries. Strong ones.  
People say, “You seem happy.”  
And yes, we are.  
But also… not quite.

We download dating apps, stare at “hi” and “hello,” and get tired before replying.  
We go to events, but staying out late feels like a commitment already.  
If something feels off? We know instantly.  
No overthinking. No forcing. We move on. We feel. We stay strong.

Sometimes I miss my 20s....  
when taking BS was part of the process,  
when red flags were 'just vibes'  
when hope was louder than experience.

But we cant unlearn what life already taught us.

We meet people. We know what we want.  
We like someone… maybe even almost love them.  
But letting go of the life we’ve built?  
That’s the hard part.

We’ve been there.  
We’ve loved deeply.  
We’ve been hurt.  
And because of that, we don’t settle, not anymore.

It’s not about looks.  
Not about labels.  
Not about categories.

It’s about connection.  
The easy kind.  
The safe kind.  
The freedom-to-be-yourself kind.

Someone once told me:  
Physical attraction is a bonus, but why settle without alignment?

We’re wired into our careers, our routines, our independence.  
We entertain conversations, we try… but we’re painfully aware.  
Some say it’s a mental health issue...but honestly?  
In this era, who isn’t fighting something quietly?

We’ve tried intentional dating.  
Organic meetings.  
Astrology. Numerology.  
And yes haha adult money is fun.  
We can afford things. We can go places. We can choose ourselves.

But we’re not here to be sugar mommas either.

At the end of the day, how we were raised, what we endured, and what we healed from.  
that’s what shaped us.

So maybe the real struggle isn’t being too picky.  
Maybe it’s being too aware.

As 2026 begins, a new cycle, I wish this for us:  
**Peace. Connection. Courage.**  
**Whatever form that comes in.**

Maybe this is also a reminder to myself:  
Loosen up, just a little.  
Not recklessly. Not irresponsibly.  
But bravely.

Book the ticket.  
Talk to strangers.  
Hit the gym.  
Protect your identity.  
Don’t shrink for anyone.

This isn’t a pressure talk.  
It’s a permission slip.

To want human connection.  
To feel. To see. To be kind.

A quiet walk.  
A slow coffee in a cafe.  
A long morning browsing the marketplace for another set of appliances that we hardly use.  
A really good massage (the premium one, yes).

If someone walks beside you, beautiful.  
If you walk alone, also beautiful.

We’re not late.  
We’re just intentional.  
And that, in itself, is powerful.

Edit: I'm male, 28, from Europe, i have no medical issue

My situation is simple, I just prefer living at night. I don't have insomnia (even when I live during the day when I have work I get all my 8 hours of sleep just fine), nor depression, i'm not forced to, I just prefer it. During long periods of vacations or long weekends when there's a festivity on Friday or Monday, when I don't have to work in the morning, I naturally wake up at 3-4pm and go sleep at 7-8am.

I've read various studies and articles on the topic, but it seems like they always include some caveats, like the people being studied were not night owls, just forced to live at night for the study, or had insomnia, or something else.

Lots of non medical articles fall in the typical pitfall of forgetting that \[correlation does not imply causation\]([https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)). ""Most night owls are also smoking"", ""most night owls also drink alchool"", ""night owls have an higher suicide rate"" etcc. Well turns out I don't smoke, I hate even the smell of alchoolic drinks, I like being alove, so I'm safe on that side. I don't even drink coffee, at all.

The only thing I could find that makes sense is problems with vitamin D for luck of sun exposure.

I've seen it called ""\[Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder\]([https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14295-delayed-sleep-phase-syndrome-dsps-in-children-and-adolescents](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14295-delayed-sleep-phase-syndrome-dsps-in-children-and-adolescents))"", but is it an actual health issue or not? I really don't understand. Everything I read seems to go back to alchool, coffee, insomnia or something else.

I have close relatives who are not doctors that keep parroting mottos like ""night is made for sleeping""/""go sleep like a normal person, it hurts you"" like some religious mantra whenever they wake up and see I haven't gone sleep yet, after years it's getting a bit frustrating.

I wish to really know: is it inherently unhealthy or are just the circumstances that make some people live at night (alchool, coffee, insomnia etcc) that are unhealthy?

I'm sure that my body's/brain's reaction will continue to evolve, but in just a week I have been surprised by a few things:

* The amount I sweat from exercise and daily activities has gone down by maybe 75%. The difference is almost shocking.
* I have a lot more patience for physical tasks. For example, this AM I shoveled snow for about a half hour... no podcast, no ""when will this be over"" feeling, just steady methodical effort that was borderline pleasant.
* I've also noticed (same vein as prior bullet) that chores require a lot less activation energy. Folding laundry, putting away the dishes, picking up my kids' toys are just not a big deal anymore.
* I'm a lot less irritable with my partner (this has improved throughout the taper). I seem to also have a lot more patience for my kids and ability to give them sustained attention.
* Alcohol seems to make me more groggy and tired than it did before. Maybe it always did this but I just never noticed because of the omnipresent caffeine buzz?

We share a lot of friends groups, so we had to see each other a lot, and we were able to continue talking without it being that weird. We also separated because of external problems from the relationship itself, so the final status was ""maybe in the future we can try again"". In the meantime, things have been great

One of the situations that made me want to break up with her, though (and I'll describe it because it's important for what happened this weekend), was one time at a friends house when she got really drunk and started saying a lot of things to me. That I'm fatphobic (because ""I do a lot of exercise and diet"" because I was previously obese), that I'll leave her because she's ugly and I like pretty girls... She even pointed to one of my friend's guests and told me ""You like her, don't you?"". I only had exchanged a couple of greetings with that person, since like ever.

So that night, the gf of one of my best friends (she's also kinda close with me, we talk a lot at meetings and such) took notice of how drunk she was, and took her to the bathroom to help her calm down. They didn't know each other, so I took it as a really nice gesture. They stayed there for like half an hour, and she came out better. But after that, every meeting was a reason for her to flip on me for one reason or the other, and that lead to me wanting to end things.

The thing is, as I said, after we separated we continued being friends. And things have been great lately. We hang out, talk a lot, like... We continued being close, but all the problems that came with us being a couple kinda disappeared

... Until a couple of days ago. We went out to talk and have a coffee, and after that, I went to my best friend's house to have dinner (the one whose gf helped me calm her down that night). I told him that I was just returning from hanging out with her, and he said that I shouldn't continue being in contact with her, because she's no good and I'm better alone. I said that we are friends and nothing more at least for now, but since he repeats that a lot (like every time I mention her), I asked why he thinks that. Then, he said that he has to tell me something, but I can't repeat it because I wasn't supposed to know, because his gf didn't wanted to get involved. Then, he told me that my ex, while at the bathroom with his gf, told a lot of really personal stuff about me (that I'm bad at bed, that I have a small penis and I'm not able to satisfy her...). And that it went on for the entire time they were there

This, in all honesty, felt like a knife in the back. Because one of the main reasons I was still trying to keep a friendly relationship with her, was because I felt safe towards these kinds of stuff. We talk a lot, know about each other's secrets and insecurities. I never thought about her being able to just talk shit like that about me with someone she barely even knew. So it made me doubt about a lot of stuff.

But now I feel crazy for being mad and disappointed because of something that happened months ago, and that we had already gotten over with. I don't care about the comments themselves, because I know that they're not true and I'm not insecure about it, but thinking that now I'll have to rethink everything that I've told her, feels awful",2,1765816690.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

I am an RT who has always worked per diem since starting my career, except for a few FT travel contracts while my husband was laid off and did all the childcare.

He just started a job with an hour commute each way. He leaves the house at 5:30am and gets home at 4:30 earliest. There is currently no wiggle room, at least for the start time.

I was offered a per diem position at an excellent hospital one hour away. I’ve been hoping to get in with this system since we moved out to SoCal. I elected for per diem as they didn’t have a PT position that would fit my schedule, and FT just seems a bit too much with that commute. I only need to work 4 shifts a month (2 weekend days required) but I can probably build a schedule around 15-20 hours a week. Sounds great.

My kids bdays are in Jan and they will be 4 and 2. I have been a mostly SAHM who works here and there (a few shifts a month with a dif hospital when my husband could WFH and watch them, VERY unreliable and changing hours, or the aforementioned 12 week contracts when he was unemployed) their entire lives and I am DYING. I really need to get back to work. I love them so much and feel fortunate and proud we’ve been scrappy/resourceful enough to make SAH an option in their early lives while trying to bring in dual-income here and there, but at this point, I’m really struggling with the day-to-day and am ready to get a stricter schedule in place.

I feel like I am doing all 3 of us a disservice by staying home. I’m burnt out, touched out and temperamental doing 14 hour days of just full-on kid stuff. My extroverted daughter (4) dropped naps and isnt  getting the social stimulation she craves because I can’t spend ALL day out around other people at parks, libraries etc.

My son (2) is a RUNNER and so any outing is just spent trying to chase him back to the playground from the parking lot, street, etc. It’s not fun for me and my daughter doesn’t get to play with me when I’m constantly chasing after her brother. He still naps and really needs them so if he’s knocked out for 2 hours, I can’t go do much with my daughter out of the house and I’m just tired of putting together crafts and activities that get abandoned after a few minutes when I would rely on that block of time to get my OWN stuff done, answer emails/texts, call people, NAP myself, get some cleaning done…

You get the idea. They all need age-appropriate care which for some reason I’m no longer able to provide single-handedly while splitting my attention between them. If money were no object I’d get my daughter in the beautiful new Montessori that opened up down the street ($1200/mo) until TK starts in August (free) and get a nanny or sitter to watch my son for the 8-10 hours I’d need to work a shift and commute ($$$??)

So here is the situation. I have done all the onboarding, physicals, etc for this per diem hospital job. But to get me full trained, they want me to go full time for a month. Hours will be something like M-F, 7-430, give or take, with an hour commute (at least), for 4 weeks.

If I can get her in preschool, the hours are typically 9-3 with the option of doing a monthly fee for early start/late pickup, which would be 8-4 or 5 (a LONG day for a 4 year old). We could enroll my son there, too, but he’s not very interested in socializing right now and while the skills would be good, I’d rather get him up to speed with other one-on-one interactions and then do preschool. It’s very very expensive for his age group and I don’t think he’d like it.

I simply don’t know how to make this work. For those who made it this far, here’s the breakdown:

Husband: Leaves 5:30 am, Returns 4:30 pm

Me: Leave 6 am, Return 5:30 pm

Daughter (4) :preschool 9-3

Son (2) : babysitter all day?

I don’t want to have to back out if this job. RT is kind of a small world and I don’t want to burn a bridge with one of the best hospitals in the region. Also, I really WANT to work there (not full time as stated, but the training program is what it is and they don’t seem super flexible)

I guess I could ask to do a later start time for training, like start at 9 and go to 5:30, get home around 7 (kids bedtime) but even still I’d need to leave ample time to get to the hospital (notorious traffic commute).

Moving isn’t an option. Despite being VVVVVHCOL area (again, SoCal, coastal town) I love our house and community and neighborhood, the school system is excellent and we have a good interest rate locked in.

Do I hire a babysitter who walks daughter down to school and picks her up and otherwise stays with my son all day?

Will they take him out to parks and stuff?

Worth mentioning that my mom offered to fly out from across the country to help watch the kids for the duration or part of it, and I think I’d like to take her up on that, but 4 weeks is a LONG time to have a parent in your small bungalow and she and my husband butt heads a lot. She suggested I just put her in an air bnb for the whole time if “it’s less than the cost of childcare” but she won’t have my car since I’ll need it and honestly I don’t think that arrangement would be cheaper, despite having the space which would be good for all us introverts (and the quality time either way grandbabies that she really really wants)

If you read this far, thanks, and please try not to judge me. Again, if money were no object, this would all be sorted, but money is a major fucking obstacle for us right now so unfortunately that’s not the case. Just trying to figure out a way to make those 4 weeks smooth - even if I barely break even with money - so I can get my individuality and mental health back and be a better mom on my days off

Thank you for any advice re: scheduling, planning childcare

We've known my wife's mum is a narc and her childhood is riddled with red flags. How ever a recent event has me questioning my own parents now. So my mum would ask to meet for coffee and ive been really busy working and on my rare days off ive been trying to obtain my motorcycle license (which I now have yay 😊) among other things like sorting the kids out and dog to vets and all that comes with running a house. 


On the day of my test I reply to a text asking to meet for coffee and I reply to say I can't as I have my test and it's my only day off she text back to say how disappointed she is then sends a picture of a Christmas decoration I made when I was 6/7 I ignored this and carried on with my day. I then received a barrage of abuse from my 2 sisters calling me all names under the sun for making mum cry.

Now I'm the bad one for not cancelling plans and meeting her for coffee although when she askeds to come round to see her grandchildren and we agree a day time she cancels last minute on the day either ill or some other excuse. I also have asked that my family make sure I am home before they come round as with two toddlers and two dogs it's a struggle when my wife is home and I'm at work this has been met with 'how dare I dictate when people can come round' and this has been twisted into I've told her she can't come round at all unless it's with my dad (they've been divorced 20+years). I guess I'm just asking if this is narc behavior and I've just been blind to it for all these years. I'm not really sure what to do thank you for reading.

Why don't you treat yourself to something nice?

Idle Village Hero 4 is out today! This one is a HaremLit LitRPG focused on balancing plot and ""plot,"" with a small harem. Here's the blurb:

**Gods don't compromise. Heroes don't kneel.**  
  
The Nine Gods of Ionia have finally noticed what Harper's become: an isekai with the power of a Dungeon Lord, something that should be impossible. Something that threatens the very order they've maintained for so long. Their verdict is already decided. He must die. But if Harper falls, so does the dungeon of Rozklad and Haven's Rest. As does every soul who ever believed in his impossible dream.  
  
So he'll fight tooth and nail to keep them from dismantling what he's built.  
  
At least he doesn't have to fight alone. His girlfriends stand beside him in more than just power. Their vows will bind them. They're a family standing united against divinity itself, proving that what you build together is stronger than what any god can break.  
  
The gods want conformity. They demand submission. **But free people don't bow, not even to gods.**

Not caught up? Books 1-3 in the series are on sale for $0.99 (in the .com and .co.uk store only - I'm not able to do sales in other storefronts, sorry) and so that's nearly half a million words for less money than a cup of coffee.

I know what I would say to myself as an outsider, I'm not scared I can't find better, I also know that the easier option would be to walk, but is it the easier option?  I'm not walking and I'm hurting myself everyday for why?? 

It's been a year since he left and will be a year in March the day I found out about the affair, April we decided we were going to work on us. 
The affair started a month before he actually left, he then carried on seeing me trying to fix us and rebuilding on our relationship within those 4 months whilst being in a relationship, unbeknownst to me, with her.


When I found out I felt like my world disintegrated, I was heartbroken, angry and devastated, almost frantic trying to hold on to him as if I was losing a 'prize' and I somewhat got satisfaction out of me 'winning' my 'prize'
I know how that sounds believe me, I'm not completely demented to understand how deranged and pathetic that sounds.
I haven't got amazing self love, if you hadn't noticed. 

I'm 35, my first ever partner was 20 and I was 15, it took me till my mid 20s to understand that that was off, I was with him for 9 years and when we separated, I'd caught him on CCTV full on shagging our barmaid, I panicked and went straight in to a 2year physically, sexually and financially abusive relationship 

Before the guy I'm with now I was single a little under 5 years, out of pure choice, I was that traumatised from my previous relationship I suffered PTSD and needed a lot of therapy.

When I met my current partner, omg I didn't know what hit me, this kind, caring overly thoughtful man willing to take on a single mother and her children. 

Hes still soo attentive, recognises when I'm down and a good 80% of the time understands and we're really working hard on our communication. In the new year I have expressed weight need couples therapy because I am still very up and down, and when I'm down I don't want him near me really, I dissociate, a little gem of a mental disorder I picked up from my abusive relationship. Shutdown and don't want to communicate, I've been getting better though. 

Hes on holiday for 10 days he's left an old phone here still logged in to socials
It's done my mental health the world of good..... Not 

I've gone back on everything, socials Google photos, messages you name it. 
Why? What am I looking for, I don't want to leave, I don't want to lose him, but I feel like I'm addicted to the fight or flight response, the forever survival mode. 

Seeing him tell his friends it was me that stepped out, I'm not blowing my own trumpet but you'd be hard pushed to find someone as loyal as me. 
Photos of her still on his back up. 
Searching mutual friends not more than a few weeks ago, but he's messaging me saying how much he adores me, he'll never hurt me again in our lives, he wants to marry me, experience life together. In those seconds I believe him, and then I think back to how he betrayed me and wonder how he could do that to someone he adores. I couldn't. 

In those seconds I believe the biggest mistake of his life was doing what he did and for those seconds I believe he'd never do it again...... Then it passes Nd I'm back to survival mode.

Why am I doing this?
I hide it well from friends and family specially my children, if I feel overwhelmed or like there could be an argument I go for a drive and coffee and listen to music 

My brain is forever loud, I am forever tired 
But when I'm laid there on him it's quiet just for that little time in the evenings it all disappears

So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

Attackers rely on emotion, urgency, and trust to get past even the strongest technical controls. When you recognize the patterns, you can stop the attack before it starts.","Here’s what you need to know:

→ Pretexting

↳ The attacker invents a believable scenario: “I’m from IT, we detected a problem on your account.”

↳ They gather enough background details to sound legitimate.

Real-world example: Someone calls pretending to be from your bank’s fraud department requesting verification.

Red flags: Unsolicited calls asking for personal info, pressure to “just confirm quickly.”

→ Phishing

↳ Fake emails or texts designed to steal credentials or spread malware.

↳ Uses urgency, fear, or authority to bypass critical thinking.

Real-world example: An “HR portal update” link that leads to a fake login page.

Red flags: Misspelled domains, unexpected password resets, attachments you didn’t request.

→ Spear Phishing

↳ Highly customized attacks aimed at a specific person or department.

↳ Often uses personal details from LinkedIn or past emails.

Real-world example: A message appearing to come from your CFO requesting an urgent wire transfer.

Red flags: Slight email address variations, unusual money or data requests.

→ Baiting

↳ Offering something enticing to lure someone into compromising themselves.

↳ Relies on curiosity or convenience.

Real-world example: A USB drive labeled “Confidential” left in a parking lot.

Red flags: Free downloads, unknown devices, unexpected pop-ups asking for permissions.

→ Tailgating / Piggybacking

↳ Gaining physical access by following someone through a secure door.

↳ Exploits politeness and “I don’t want to be rude.”

Real-world example: Someone walking in behind you holding coffee, asking you to keep the door open.

Red flags: People without badges, visitors avoiding check-in procedures.

→ Impersonation

↳ Attacker pretends to be someone the victim expects or trusts.

↳ Often involves technical jargon to sound credible.

Real-world example: A fake IT technician asking for remote access to “fix a problem.”

Red flags: Unexpected support requests, demands for passwords, requests for remote control.

I know what I would say to myself as an outsider, I'm not scared I can't find better, I also know that the easier option would be to walk, but is it the easier option?  I'm not walking and I'm hurting myself everyday for why?? 

It's been a year since he left and will be a year in March the day I found out about the affair, April we decided we were going to work on us. 
The affair started a month before he actually left, he then carried on seeing me trying to fix us and rebuilding on our relationship within those 4 months whilst being in a relationship, unbeknownst to me, with her.


When I found out I felt like my world disintegrated, I was heartbroken, angry and devastated, almost frantic trying to hold on to him as if I was losing a 'prize' and I somewhat got satisfaction out of me 'winning' my 'prize'
I know how that sounds believe me, I'm not completely demented to understand how deranged and pathetic that sounds.
I haven't got amazing self love, if you hadn't noticed. 

I'm 35, my first ever partner was 20 and I was 15, it took me till my mid 20s to understand that that was off, I was with him for 9 years and when we separated, I'd caught him on CCTV full on shagging our barmaid, I panicked and went straight in to a 2year physically, sexually and financially abusive relationship 

Before the guy I'm with now I was single a little under 5 years, out of pure choice, I was that traumatised from my previous relationship I suffered PTSD and needed a lot of therapy.

When I met my current partner, omg I didn't know what hit me, this kind, caring overly thoughtful man willing to take on a single mother and her children. 

Hes still soo attentive, recognises when I'm down, a good 80% of the time understands and we're really working hard on our communication. In the new year I have expressed we need couples therapy because I am still very up and down, and when I'm down I don't want him near me really, I dissociate, a little gem of a mental disorder I picked up from my past abusive relationship. Shutdown and don't want to communicate, I've been getting better though. 

Hes currently on holiday for 10 days he's left an old phone here still logged in to socials
It's done my mental health the world of good..... Not 

I've gone back on everything, socials, Google photos, messages you name it. 
Why? What am I looking for, I don't want to leave, I don't want to lose him, but I feel like I'm addicted to the fight or flight response, the forever survival mode. 

Seeing him tell his friends it was me that stepped out, I'm not blowing my own trumpet but you'd be hard pushed to find someone as loyal as me. 
Photos of her still on his back up. 
Still Searching mutual friends not more than a few weeks ago, but he's messaging me saying how much he adores me, he'll never hurt me again in our lives, he wants to marry me, experience life together. In those seconds I believe him, and then I think back to how he betrayed me and wonder how he could do that to someone he adores. I couldn't. 

In those seconds I believe the biggest mistake of his life was doing what he did and for those seconds I believe he'd never do it again...... Then it passes and I'm back to survival mode.

Why am I doing this?
I hide it well from friends and family specially my children, if I feel overwhelmed or like there could be an argument I go for a drive and coffee and listen to music 

My brain is forever loud, I am forever tired 
But when I'm laid there on him it's quiet just for that little time in the evenings it all disappears 

It's hard I feel like I've aged a decade 

And I wonder if I can get through this ",0,1765816243.0,Infidelity,1,0.5,False

So that does represent me.

Now the post is as follows:

Hey everyone! 👋
I’m a 31-year-old Indian guy living in Mumbai, and honestly, I'm just trying to make some proper connections. Looking for chill friends, people to hang out with, and yeah, I’m also open to dating and finding that long-term relationship thing.
What I Bring to the Table:
 * The Chatterbox: Heads up, I talk a lot. I'm that person who can keep a conversation going about anything—from the meaning of life to which pizza topping is superior. If you like someone who actually responds with more than one word, we'll get along.
 * My Comfort Zone = Your Screen: I am a serious binge watcher. Tell me what's good right now!
   * Sitcoms/Anime: These are my go-to for winding down. I'm always looking for recommendations. What show do you think is underrated?
   * Gaming: Need a player? I’m into it. Hit me up with your favorite game lately!
 * The Road Situation:
   * Bike Rides: Love 'em. Solo bike rides are the absolute best way to clear my head.
   * Car Drives: I hate driving for long distances by myself. Seriously. I need a co-pilot, a DJ, a snack sharer. So, if you're up for an adventure, I've got the car, you bring the playlist. I'm definitely not a fan of solo travel either—sharing the experience is half the fun!
Let's Talk Dating:
Real talk: Dating apps feel like a job, right? 😩 It takes so much effort, and it often feels like the people you meet there are looking for something completely different than what you actually want. I'd much rather meet someone organically through shared interests or just by being friends first.
If any of this sounds like your cup of tea, and you’re in Mumbai (or close enough to meet up), drop me a DM. Tell me your best road trip story or the last time you stayed up way too late watching one more episode!
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Thanks, Gippity. *takes the mic back*

# Introduction

A lot of times we come on here and tell people *who* we want when we should be telling them *what* we want. A beautifully painted picture of what the day-to-day looks like as well as those more fun times. So, with that being said, here is the picture of the life I want.

# Partnership in Monotony

We're adults, working 5+ days a week just to put food on the table and reach our mutual and individual goals. There goes 40-60 hours of our time together, and we have to remove those pesky 56 hours to get 8 hours of sleep per night if we're lucky. So, we have 52-72 hours left. 52-72 hours approximately to do everything else for ourselves, our families, friends, hobbies, and us.

Wow, that's a tight window!

Yet, we have a superpower. We are a *team*.  Sitting down together after dinner and working spreadsheets, Notions, shared Google calendars, and scribbling plans together is a whole DATE. Sipping on decaf because it's too late for caffeine while we laugh about how the weekend or next week is going to be a mess. Leaning over and giving each other little kisses and looking into one another's eyes with that neurodivergent depth that reads the slight discomfort in your right knee from that gym incident when you were 19.

If we're not doing that, we're sitting on our Discord server planning roleplays and story ideas for us to work on together. Then, we have to laugh because we've been planning this RP for like 4 days and we really should just jump into it but it's OK. Then we might jump into one and spend hours just poking at each other's brains with these great stories that stimulate us mentally and emotionally. If we're not RPing, we're watching a show/movie, gaming together or parallel playing, or maybe you're watching me or I'm watching you game on stream! Could be any of those.

There's always room for silence too.

God, how hard is it for people to sit in silence? Not us. We sit in silence, doing our thing, scrolling our phones. We bump legs or we're sitting on a call just listening to the background noise. Every now and then one of us goes ""I love you"" and the other goes ""forever and always.""

Maybe it's ""Dude, you're going to let the streak die. Send me something.""

Definitely it's us planning our next trip to see each other which eventually becomes planning our move-in, then it becomes planning our dates or trips together. The years passing one by one as we watch each other get older but our connection grows deeper.

Eventually it's not just us, now it's waking up at 2 AM to inconsolable crying as we both sigh and one of us takes our turn to feed our little munchkin.

The days become watching our family grow older and bigger. Visiting family. Family visiting. Traveling together. Sending grandma and grandpa picture of their munchkins and their tired kids who are learning to be parents.

Yet, we still sit together after dinner. Just now with kids joining us. Reading together. Gaming together. Teaching them about writing and narrative structure and all that. Listening to them tell us about their hobbies and all the latest fun things and us having to study because we're getting older and we are starting to ""live under a rock"".

# The Excitement of Certain Times

When we both manage to get out of being homebodies, that's also a great time.

I don't know about you, but I love getting dressed to the 20s (the 9s is too little). Perfect outfit. Perfect perfume. Even the choice of lotion is well decided. Then... We pull up to a great reservation... Somewhere simple.

God, do I hate those super expensive places that serve you three shreds of food and you're left wanting.

Let's go get tacos then roll up to a private lounge where you need a reservation a month out just to have a few drinks and little bites. Then we step out and walk down the street along the way stopping at an antique book store before noticing there's an ice cream shop next door.

Now, I love smoking cigars (not every day obviously), so you push me along to our reservation at the cigar lounge. We pull up, hugs and kisses as per Hispanic protocol to our friends who are staff. We take our seats, order our drinks, listen to the live music, and you can watch me light my cigar with patience which shows why you love me. Maybe you'll be the type of partner that joins me in smoking a cigar (if you're not that's OK).

We have to be constantly remembering to take pictures and selfies otherwise there's never a darn record that we went out or did anything. Always more preoccupied with the vibes and capturing the landscapes that ourselves.

The conversation is always great between us as we laugh and chat, even texting the things we can't say aloud as we plan the end of the evening.

# The ""Me to You""

Who am I as a partner? Let's go bullet mode...

* You get woken up to gentle kisses and ""Your (INSERT MORNING DRINK HERE) is ready, honey. Do you want your eggs scrambled or fried? Oh, I also got fresh Cuban bread.""
* I walk over with a glass of water and a fistful of meds the moment I see you start to go under the weather or you mention a coworker/friend/family member is getting sick
* I come home with pastries/treats if I happen to be driving by one of your favorite spots
* I write you little notes to keep in your bags, desks, and other such places
* I never leave without knowing the next time I will see you
* I happily help with technology-related issues
* AND SO MUCH MORE!!!

# Who am I?

Here's the pertinent details about me...

* Located in Miami, FL but travel often for work across the southeast US and occassionally outside the southeast for conferences, trainings, and otherwise
* 5'7"" (170 cm), 165 lb (75 kg), average build

* Secondary hobbies include gardening, painting, interior design, and martial arts (judo, kendo, and iaido)
* Type one diabetic (T1D) since I was 4 years old, so I am insulin dependent and use an insulin pump and continous glucose monitor (CGM)

* I am mainly a PC and PS5 gamer these days, BUT I do own an Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch. I have also successfully acquired a wonderful OLED Steamdeck I have been adoring for work and personal travel
* Some of the games I play (or have played) include: World of Warcraft (Retail & Classic), Diablo / Path of Exile, Halo (2, 3, and some Reach), Oldschool Runescape, Skyrim, and so forth

# Important Details (PLEASE READ)

My main key point is that I don't care WHO you are or WHAT you look like or WHAT you're into so long as you see yourself fitting into this picture I have painted.

Every detail I wrote is important to me. There is nothing there that I can really compromise on without compromising myself and what makes my life happy to live and future worth working toward.

However, let's be clear about some of the following...

**Big details...**

* I am open to online/long-distance so long as we are BOTH putting in the work it takes
* I am only interested in cis(female) or transmale partners since I would like to start a biological family at some point
* I am NOT interested in potential partners that already have children, though potential exception may be made for those parents with children 13 years-old or older AND still healthy enough to have more children
* I am only interested in those in the United States at this point (this is due to international travel being more difficult due to my job)
* If you are NOT in the United States and STILL wish to try at this, please know that YOU will have to try to visit me instead of the other way around until I figure out the logistics of visiting your country with my job

**More about you...**

* You have a job
* You take care of yourself (e.g. if you have a medical condition you are actively treating it, you attend therapy if applicable, etc.)
* Co-habitation, long-term commitment, and having kids does NOT scare you and is a decided fact for you (not saying right off the bat but once the years pass and we reach each step), if you are unsure about any of those then maybe this isn't for you (and that's OK)",1,1765816135.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1pnbqkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pnbqkc/i_thought_my_daughters_imaginary_friends_were/,I Thought My Daughter's Imaginary Friends Were Harmless... Until I Met Mr. Long. - Part 1,"It is currently 12:17 am when I’m writing this. I have been awake for almost twenty-four hours straight because of my daughter’s imaginary friend. I am afraid that if I try to sleep now, I might not wake up. I’m not being kept awake by anxiety, or some nightmare… this is more disturbing… this is real. Fuck… I’m getting ahead of myself… let me back up a bit.

 I’ll start from the beginning.

My name is John… a single dad who does his best to provide for his small family. My wife died just over four years ago while giving birth to our only daughter, Emma. The hole she left has been almost too deep to fill. Some days, I ask myself why I keep moving forward until I see my daughter’s bright, smiling face. That makes it all worth it.

We live in a modest one-story house in rural Oregon. It isn’t much, but it keeps a roof over our heads, especially with my meager salary. As a struggling writer, that’s about all I can ask for nowadays. About two weeks ago, something strange started happening… or at least that’s when I noticed it.

It was a Tuesday. I had just arrived home from making a quick grocery run to the supermarket across the street. Emma is very mature for being 4 years old and doesn’t mind too much when I have to run out for five minutes. We live in a pretty nice neighborhood anyway, so I’m not worried about anything happening, especially when I can see my house from the store windows. I put the groceries away, picked up the dirty clothes that lay strewn about on the floor, and then made my way into the kitchen. I tossed some Hot Pockets into the microwave, pretending it was a legitimate dinner, and then went to find Emma.

I had to look around a little more than normal for her, which surprised me. She wasn’t in the living room watching TV like usual.

“Emma.” I called out, “Emma, honey. Where are you?”

I walked down the hallway toward her bedroom, figuring maybe she’d gone to take a nap. As I approached the door, the air got extremely cold. Even though the heat was on, it felt like a freezer had been opened in her room, blowing a stiff, cold breeze into the hallway.

I could see that the door was slightly cracked, only the slightest sliver of light pressing through. I grabbed the door handle, but before I could push it open, I heard a whisper. It was Emma’s voice… it sounded like she was talking to someone. I quietly pushed the door open, trying not to disturb her. She was sitting on the floor next to her closet, leaning toward it as if she were whispering to someone inside.

At first, I assumed she was just lost in her own little world, talking to an imaginary friend. Like most kids her age, she has a very active imagination. She has tea parties with her stuffed animals, draws monsters with googly eyes, and more often than not, pulls me in so she can practice her makeup skills. I figured this was just another one of her friends who was pretending to live in her closet. I stepped into the room and prepared to call her to dinner. Before I could get her name out of my mouth to grab her attention, she stopped whispering… listening for a response from the closet.

She listened intently, pushing her ear against the door. This was new. It seemed harmless, and yet… disturbing. I stood watching, waiting to see the outcome. She nodded her head as if agreeing with the non-existent person behind the door before whispering back in response. This wasn’t just childish banter… she was having a legitimate conversation.

“Why don’t you like the sunlight?” She asked, pausing and pushing her ear to the closet door.

She waited a moment and then turned to whisper back.

“Oh… that’s sad.”

She paused a few seconds longer… grimacing with discontent.

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell Daddy.”

A chill ran down my spine as she spoke that final sentence. The words she spoke were so unnerving. I had never heard her talk like that before. I knocked softly and stepped into the center of the room, interrupting her conversation.

“Emma, honey? Who are you talking to?” I asked, trying to push what I heard out of my mind.

The unsettled feeling left just as quickly as it had come. I chalked it up to just her active imagination. She turned to look at me and smiled hesitantly, like I had interrupted an important meeting.

“Mr. Long,” she said.

I smiled and crouched down next to her.

“Oh yeah? Is Mr. Long one of your friends who lives in the closet?” I asked, trying to rationalize it. “He’s like Mr. Bear and Mr. Duck, right?”

She looked at me like I was an idiot. Her face scrunched in confusion as she answered my question.

“No. He’s too big to fit in there,” She said matter-of-factly as if I should have already known that.

I admit, something about the way she said that didn’t sound playful or childish. It sounded so sincere… so haunting for some reason. Before I could respond, she continued to describe Mr. Long.

“He’s really tall, and he has long arms that touch the floor, even when he stands up.” She explained, now smiling again. “His fingers wiggle like spaghetti noodles and tickle my toes when I’m asleep.”

She giggled and looked up at me with a face full of such happiness that I almost couldn’t perceive how disturbing her description was.

“He lives in the wall with his friend. She’s really nice.” She said, before scooting closer to the closet door.

“What?” I thought to myself. There can’t be another one. It was unsettling enough to think about an imaginary friend tickling my daughter’s feet at night... but now he lives inside the walls with another girl…? I looked down at her, holding a slight grin, hoping that it was no more than just her wild imagination. A few moments of silence followed, letting the thought sink further and further into my brain.

She looked up at me as if I understood. I smiled, holding my concern at bay. I wasn’t so sure that I enjoyed hearing about Mr. Long and his friend in the wall, but kids have creepy imaginations. I figured it was just a phase and that it would pass. I gave her the “That’s awesome, sweetheart” line I always used when she told me something I didn’t understand before kissing her forehead and helping her to her feet.

“Alright, honey, it’s time to eat,” I said, pulling her away from the closet door. “I’m sure Mr. Long needs to eat, too.”

She smiled, looking at me.

“He doesn’t eat,” she said. “Mr. Long just likes to watch.”

I laughed it off, hugged her, and picked her up to carry her to the dinner table. I tried not to think about the conversation, but something about it kept pressing its way back into my mind. It was strange. Her answers were so odd and somewhat disturbing. I ended up letting it go for the sake of her happiness… and my sanity.

That Thursday night was a rough one. I had been writing all day, straining my eyes so badly that my head screamed at me to stop. I finally closed the laptop and decided to relax on the couch for a bit to watch a documentary. I had put Emma to bed a couple of hours prior, making sure that she was settled in for the night. As a single dad, I always have a baby monitor on the coffee table just in case something happens. I know that she probably doesn’t need it, but it makes me feel better to have it. I had fallen asleep on the couch when I heard it crackle to life. Usually, it is filled with soft static or her steady breathing as she sleeps. This time, however, it was filled with whispers. I sat up straight and looked at my phone. It was 2:46 am… There was no reason for her to be awake at this hour.

At first, I thought she was talking in her sleep. It was a stretch, being that she had never done that before, but I figured it was possible. I picked up the monitor and held it up to my ear. I could hear her voice, speaking softly, followed by a pause. For the first couple of pauses, I couldn’t hear anything. It was on the third or fourth pause when I heard another voice fill the silence. This one was definitely not Emma. It was low and raspy… not a child’s voice. I turned up the volume, thinking it was just a speaker anomaly.

“…not ready yet…” (static) “…soon. Be patient…” the voice muttered.

“But I want to play now,” Emma responded quickly. “She said she wants me to come in.”

I had heard enough. I jumped up from the couch and rushed down the hall to her bedroom. The door was standing wide open. My concern level skyrocketed. I knew I had closed it when I put her to bed. I slowly peered around the doorframe, scanning the entranceway to her room. Her nightlight was flickering like it was struggling to stay alive. Emma was lying on her side, thumb in her mouth, eyes half-closed. All of her stuffed animals were lined up on the edge of her bed, facing the closet like they were an audience waiting for the show.

I looked over to the closet door. It was slightly open… darkness covering every inch in an inky black curtain.

“Emma,” I whispered, stepping toward the bed. “Are you okay, honey?”

She nodded without looking at me, still barely holding her eyes open.

“The girl in the wall says that the dark feels good.” She said sleepily. “She wants to come play.”

Her voice was flat. She wasn’t scared; she was more… dejected.

I walked over to the closet and pulled the door open all the way. As the door swung open, knocking against the wall, I nervously scanned the darkness of the closet. Aside from her clothes, shoes, and a pink laundry basket, there was nothing of note inside. I couldn’t physically see anything… but I could smell something. The inside of the closet smelled awful. It was sharp and repulsive, making me gag almost immediately. The best description I can give is that it smelled like a mix between wet earth and something sour… like spoiled milk or rotten meat.

I slammed the closet door shut. An angry voice rose from behind me.

“Daddy!”

Concerned by the tone, I spun around to look at Emma.

“Don’t do that,” Emma said, sitting straight up in bed… eyes now wide open and staring at me. “He doesn’t like the door closed.”

That was the first time that I ever felt fear from something that my daughter said to me. It didn’t make sense. This situation was so far from the norm that I could not mentally comprehend any of it. I tried to ask Emma about what happened, but she lay back down, acting as if she was going to sleep. Every attempt to question her was met with irritated groaning and pulling away from me in discontent. I eventually gave up, thinking that the next day, I would get to the bottom of this, no matter what I had to do.

The next day, I was met with a coldness from Emma. My intrusion into her conversation with her friend made her angry. I made her breakfast and put on her favorite cartoons before I sat down to write. She didn’t say as many as two words to me the entire morning. 

The day ticked by like normal, only with more silence. I finished my work and formulated a plan for what I would do that night. I put Emma in a bath and went to my room to grab the tools for my plan. I had an old GoPro camera that I used when I rode dirt bikes, perfect for what I needed it to do.

While she bathed, I set up the camera in her room. I used a blanket, along with a couple of shirts, to hide it on her dresser where she couldn’t see it. I made sure to angle it so that I could see her bed and the closet all in one shot. I put her to bed, tucked her in, and kissed her goodnight. I pretended to adjust her bed’s comforter, watching her movements. I was waiting to see if she would notice the camera. She never looked in its direction as she rolled over on her side and fell asleep right away. I walked out of her room and gently pulled the door closed. I hoped that the next day would reveal the answers to all of my questions.

I waited until Emma came out to play in the living room the next morning before I went in to get the camera. As I walked into the room, the closet door was again open with the same wet, rotting smell emanating from it. I reviewed the footage on my laptop as she watched cartoons. Most of it was harmless… mostly Emma tossing and turning in bed. I fast-forwarded the footage to a point that caught my eye. At 2:19 am, over about two seconds, her closet door slowly creaked open. From the darkness, a long, black figure slithered into frame.

The figure slid out of the closet like it didn’t have bones, almost like a snake worming its way upright. It was tall and thin with arms that slid across the floor as it moved.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

SO, I found a caterpillar that someone had chucked in the bloody bin at work, and he was sitting in a puddle of coffee. I’ve saved a caterpillar before earlier this year - and I was determined to save this guy. Got him out the coffee asap and on some dry land, dropped tiny water droplets in him to wash away the coffee. I got him last night and built a cute enclosure for him. He curled up into ball when I first picked him up which is how I knew he was alive. It’s been 24 hours and I checked on him, he had buried himself under some moss when I checked this morning but still curled into a ball which made me worry. I came back from work to check on him, and he was still curled into a ball but now outside the moss. So I decided to gently blow some air on him, and I got a reaction which again reassured me he was okay. I opened the window for some cold air (he’s a winter caterpillar and you need to match their temp to outside) and I checked on him again and he’s finally straightened up 😭 I’m so so happy! I think I’m going to call him Credence and if anyone wants updates I’ll probably post! He doesn’t seem like he’s too far away from pupating so let’s see!

Why don't you treat yourself to something nice?

Idle Village Hero 4 is out today! Here's the blurb:

**Gods don't compromise. Heroes don't kneel.**  
  
The Nine Gods of Ionia have finally noticed what Harper's become: an isekai with the power of a Dungeon Lord, something that should be impossible. Something that threatens the very order they've maintained for so long. Their verdict is already decided. He must die. But if Harper falls, so does the dungeon of Rozklad and Haven's Rest. As does every soul who ever believed in his impossible dream.  
  
So he'll fight tooth and nail to keep them from dismantling what he's built.  
  
At least he doesn't have to fight alone. His girlfriends stand beside him in more than just power. Their vows will bind them. They're a family standing united against divinity itself, proving that what you build together is stronger than what any god can break.  
  
The gods want conformity. They demand submission. **But free people don't bow, not even to gods.**

Not caught up? Books 1-3 in the series are on sale for $0.99 (in the .com and .co.uk store only - I'm not able to do sales in other storefronts, sorry) and so that's nearly half a million words for less money than a cup of coffee.

I've spent the last couple of months writing a Christmas campaign, and I wanted it to literally pull emotions out of your body and stomp on them :D

I wrote death scenes, I wrote tragic backstories, I wrote solemn landscapes, and somehow, and I don't know why, some of the scenes ended up feeling like Resident Evil.

To mention one specifically, in the beginning, you're in Cindy Lou Who's house. I wanted this to be like, super sad, like Cindy is stirring a pot of soup just to stay warm, right? So I needed to build the house around her, and obviously tell a story with the environment, so her parents are in the room with her... frozen... and dead... and her mom is missing a finger... which is in the soup. Okay, so I know that was obviously body horror, but I was going for ""she's going to freeze to death if she doesn't put everything she has available in this pot."" which is sad, right? But the finger, oh, and I forgot to mention, Cindy is missing a clump of hair, which is also... yeah... in the soup.

Would you say that's more sad or scary?

EDIT: I added the note the players find on a coffee table to show the theme I'm going for.

My GYN said the procedure could not have gone better and she expected a speedy and relatively easy recovery. For the first week, I had normal post-op pain, but by day 3 or 4, I was able to get around, shower alone, and even had coffee on the porch. On day 7, I woke up feeling fluish: teeth-chattering chills, full body aches, ungodly fatigue, the whole nine. I have systemic Lupus, so I assumed the surgery and subsequent inflammation just sent me into a flare. I treated the symptoms and carried on. The next day, I was a little worse. Super nauseated, dizzy, exhausted, chills. I never ran a fever and my incisions looked great, so, again, I chalked it up to a lupus flare. Day 9 PO, I started having dizzy spells, massive pressure headache, and it felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. The kind of heartbeat you can feel in your eyeballs. I decided to run to the store for electrolytes and a new thermometer, but as soon as I started driving, I felt like I was blacking out amd was on the verge of either a stroke or heart attack, so I turn around and book it to the ER. They did a chest xray to rule out a blood clot, some labs, a CT with contrast, and abdominal ultrasound. The CT and US showed what they \*thought\* was a 2cm abscess in my pelvis. I was admitted and put on 72 hours of IV antibiotics. I was discharged on Thanksgiving night, but the whole weekend was sort of a blur. My pain was worse, I could barely stand, my abdomen was so swollen that I looked 6 months pregnant, plus the same symptoms as before. I called my GYN and she had me go back to the ER. They repeated the US and CT, and it shows that the ""2 cm abscess"" was actually a hemorrhagic cyst, and now it was 5×5.1x6 cm. It also showed torsion of my left ovary. I was admitted again and in emergency surgery to drain the abscess and remove my left ovary within 2 hours. I'm home now and starting to feel more human, but holy SHIT. 

I guess the point of my giant wall of text is to ask if only having one ovary is cause to start hormone replacement? I'm only 39 and really not trying to have to deal with that. ",6,1765815911.0,hysterectomy,3,1.0,False
1pnbnm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hekate101/comments/1pnbnm7/is_this_normal/,Is this normal?,"Hello everyone,

I’m reaching out from a place of awe and confusion. Until a month ago, I was a staunch atheist. What’s unfolded since has completely rewritten my reality, and I’m hoping for some perspective from experienced devotees.

This didn’t start suddenly.

· I’ve had an intense, constant connection to spiders in my home. I’m not just seeing them, I can genuinely feel when one is in the room with me, even if it's hidden. I’ll search, and there it is. This has been happening for over a year.

A month ago, I began deeply questioning my atheism. Then, two weeks ago, the calling became explicit and impossible to ignore:

1. I heard a crow call clearly in an area where I’d never heard one before.
2. Moved by instinct, I offered a simple, sincere spoken prayer to Hekate, no ritual, just words.
3. The next morning, I woke up and the word “crossroads” came out of my mouth unprompted. An overwhelming physical urge followed. I went to a physical crossroads and left an offering of garlic.
4. A family member, knowing nothing, read my coffee grounds. She described me “bringing items to a table” (I was building my first altar), said I’d “light a candle that fulfills my needs,” and told me, “Something is watching and protecting you.”
5. When I needed a key for the altar, my grandmother pointed to a specific one. It’s stamped with the brand name “Tri-Circle.”

My altar is a small box holding just that key, a garlic clove, lavender, and a pebble. It’s humble, but it feels like the center of a storm.

My questions:

1. Does this layered timeline resonate? A long period of animal omens (spiders), then a crisis of belief, followed by a rapid-fire, precise divine response?
2. How do you integrate this? The shift from “feeling spiders” to “receiving a tri-circle key via a blind prophecy” is spiritually whiplash-inducing.
3. For those who came from skepticism, how did you build a stable practice after such an explosive start?
4. Any recommended first steps or resources for someone who’s been clearly called but is still learning how to listen respectfully?

I am treating this with the utmost seriousness. I just need to understand the pattern and find my footing. Thank you for any guidance.",2,1765815908.0,Hekate101,0,1.0,False

I am using [Yesplz beans](https://www.yesplz.coffee/), which I know are phenomenal (I can do excellent 4:6 style pourovers with a Hario Switch) but I cannot seem to translate this to a machine. 



The GPT bot has been sort of helpful but it makes mistakes that are confusing (referring to a grind setting of 6.3 or something, for example, and then doubling down and claiming that is another way to refer to a grind setting of '7') and do not really inspire confidence, and the tweaks it suggests don't always make sense. On top of that the profiles that it generates haven't been great (they have been better than my non-GPT attempts but they're just not great).

  
Here's my current GPT-provided profile, I would be extremely grateful for some critiques. Brewing with an Ode Gen 2 default burr setting of 6.0, typically between 5 - 7 cups.

    Ratio: 1:16
    Bloom: 1:2.5, 45s, 93°C
    Pulses: 3, 22s
    Pulse 1: 94°C
    Pulse 2: 93°C
    Pulse 3: 91°C



FWIW I am primarily looking for maximum sweetness and milk-chocolate-style mouthfeel here, with some acidity as long as it is balanced (I do not like cranberry or citrus notes in my coffee but I do like berry and stonefruit). But sweetness is paramount.

  
If it helps, here is a description of the latest YesPlz blend.

    One of our longtime benchmark coffees—Edwin Martinez’s delicious Vista Hermosa—headlines this stellar blend with highly consequential contributions from a honey-processed Honduras and a potent peaberry coffee from Kenya. Milk chocolate, stone fruit sweetness, wonderfully round with a beautiful resonant finish.

  
Separately from the specifics of that brew profile, how do you go about dialing in a new Aiden recipe? In the past I've done the rule of thumb that if it's too tart, grind finer and if it's too intense or bitter grind coarser, but I have zero intuition beyond that when it comes to pulse count, or temperature, or time between pulses. I'd be interested in buying a large quantity of beans and spending a day getting a good baseline down, but I am having trouble getting started here. What I think might be helpful is a very rough ""start with this shape of brew profile and then here is an adjustment philosophy"", if anyone has something they can share on that front.

It's not as old as Astoria falls (Abandoned wip), but it is the first ever No sleep I ever wrote Also I would say maybe a small trigger warning for some of the more gruesome language used.)

I feel like I’m going crazy, but I know what I saw and I know that if I just tell someone, anyone, then I’ll know that what I saw wasn’t my imagination but in fact real.

For some background, me and my wife, Juliet, had first met as teenagers although we did not get together until we were both twenty. We had shared one science lesson when we were fifteen and did not speak to one another until our Senior prom and only began regularly conversing when we discovered we were going to attend the same college that none of our separate group of friends were going to. I wasn’t the best at science, to be honest, people would tell me it was common sense and I would just shrug and continue reading whatever novel I had picked up at the school library. Juliet, however, oh how she loved science. Every time I would come to her dorm, she would be studying every aspect of science she could get her hands on: plant life, toxins, genetics, she wanted to learn it all. After college, we both applied for university, her for science and me for history. In our second year, I proposed, and we got married a few months later in a small ceremony in her grandparent’s back garden. 

It was the happiest day of my life, I still get teary eyed when I remember it. No part of my mind in that moment would believe how our lives turned out only a decade later.

It began five years ago, when my wife returned from a trip she had taken alongside some co-workers to a research base in the Eastern Antarctic plateau in Antarctica. When she had first told me about the trip, I was hesitant. Sure, she had taken trips out of the country before, going to places like Norway or Iceland, but she had never gone so far as Antarctica. To be completely honest, it frightened me. Who wouldn’t be afraid of their wife of ten years going to a frozen tundra where the only message you’ll get, if any, would be a shaky sentence that you could barely understand? But I didn’t worry too much, my wife knew what she was doing and she would be back with me soon. 

Ice was her career, afterall, she was a glaciologist, which I didn’t even know was a real career until she told me about it. I was happy for her, and I was just glad that my measly salary as a history teacher at a local high school wouldn’t have to be stretched every month so we could survive.

The research trip ended up taking over a month before my wife and her team were taken out of the cold and brought back home. I picked up from the airport, expecting to finally get a warm hug back from her, but instead I got the cold shoulder as she made her way to the passenger seat and closed the door after herself. I shrugged off any feelings of doubt or worry, assuming it had been a difficult month for her or she was maybe jet lagged and wanted to be left alone. 

Instead of seeing the signs, I got into the driver’s seat, and silently drove us home.

The drive was awkward, Juliet just kept staring out the window and my small talk didn’t even attempt to begin until I could see our house that we were fast approaching.

“So, how was the trip?” I carefully asked, hoping for just one word from her instead of the silent treatment. 

She didn’t even bother to look over at me.

“Was Mark there? I think I saw his son at the airport, he’s grown hasn’t he?” Still no answer. Normally Juliet loved to tell me all the details about her trips and her team, even late at night when I’m just trying to sleep. I thought about pushing my luck and directly asking her to face me but decided against it. Instead, I pulled into our driveway, watching as Juliet exited first and closed the door after herself, leaving me alone and isolated in the car. 

I think that was when the pit began to bloom in my stomach, I wasn’t exactly sure what was going on but I still knew that I had to do something about it before it continued.

That night, I prepared a relaxing evening that consisted of layers of blankets, warm soup and Juliet’s favourite show. A new season had begun airing during her month away and I knew she would want to catch up before she returned to work and possibly get spoiled by her co-workers who stayed in the office rather than field work. I didn’t really like the show myself, I thought the acting was a bit clunky and some plots were too unbelievable to be accepted even by the most open minded, but I didn’t mind if it meant I could spend some quality time with my wife. After preparing the soup, a nice vegetarian dish as Juliet hadn’t eaten meat since a bad experience she had as a teenager, I invited her down to my den of blankets, encouraging her to sit down while I handed her one of the warm bowls. Juliet barely acknowledged me, going under at least three layers of the blankets and taking the bowl, staring blankly at the still dark tv. I sat down next to her, placing an arm around her shoulder before putting the first episode of the new season on for her. 

Juliet still didn’t react to any of this. Normally, she would tell me the relationships of every character, where I had seen their actors before and who she could not stand. But she didn’t, she sat silently, the once warm bowl in her hands losing its steam along the two hours we spent watching up until the most recent episode. 

“So, what did you think?” I asked, but, as I expected, she did not answer me. She just offered the bowl back to me and sat motionless. Sighing, I took our bowls and made my way to the kitchen, feeling a bit annoyed about the waste of food but just being glad that she was at least interacting with me, even if it was at a small scale. 

By the time I had finished clearing up, Juliet was asleep on the sofa, fully enclosed in her slumber despite the fact that the kitchen light was still shining brightly in her direction. 

I told myself that she was probably tired, because to me, that was the most logical explanation. I had work tomorrow so I left her there, making sure she had enough blankets covering her as I checked all the doors and windows, turned every light off downstairs, and made my way to our bedroom. Despite knowing she was safe, when I made it to my bed, something didn’t feel right. The bed felt colder than normal, maybe I was just imagining it, but knowing my wife was downstairs rather than with me after a month apart felt difficult to accept.

Still, I tried my best, turning off my bedroom light and going to sleep for the night.

At two in the morning, hours after I had gone to bed and hours before I would have to start getting ready for work, I could hear a strange wet sound coming from downstairs. 

Getting my slippers on, I made my way down the stairs. I followed the sound of squishing until I could hear the humming of the fridge and see its faint light. 

The silhouette of Juliet was visible as soon as I turned the corner, I could see her forearms and hands moving but her back covered her actions.

“Juliet?” I called out, but once more she did not answer. The sound of squelching only intensified but now I could hear not only the moist sounds of her fingers digging into something, I could hear her teeth as they chomped down and chewed like a dog gnawing on a bone.

Slowly, I placed a hand on Juliet’s shoulder, moving her towards me as I could finally see what she was doing.

Juliet’s fingers were deep into a container of mince, condensation dripping off the plastic and forming a puddle at her feet. Her lips and the area surrounding them were covered in a mix of blood and juices that had been composed of the other items that sat alongside the mince and on top of it as well. A small chunk of mince laid in the middle of her lips as she slurped it up and licked her lips, maintaining eye contact as her fingers dug back into the container to grab another moist handful of beef. 

To be completely honest, I froze up when I saw her standing there with the mince. I had forgotten it was even in the fridge in the first place. Normally, I would barely have any meat in the fridge or freezer, but after a week long trip to Greenland a few months before, I had brought some mince that I could have while she was gone. However, I had gone overboard in the amount I had brought and instead, a lot of it was left forgotten in the very back of our fridge. I didn’t even know that Juliet had known about it, let alone would have wanted to eat it. I felt worry begin to eat into me as I grabbed the tray of mince out of her hands, placing it down on the side and touching the back of her neck. As I rubbed the back of her neck, for a split second, I thought I felt something slithering across my fingers.

I wasn’t sure what it was, but it moved at such a speed that I just chalked it up to my tired state and I was just imagining things again. What I wasn’t imagining however, was how Juliet reacted.

Juliet’s hands grabbed my wrists, pushing me towards the stairs and glaring not at me, but just above me. Releasing my hands, Juliet’s arm pointed up the stairs and she just glared for what felt like hours but was really, just a few seconds. Her eyes looked darker than normal and I felt a chill when the back of the first step hit into my ankle. But she didn’t say anything, just pointing.

Deciding to not argue, I went back upstairs and went to bed.

When my alarm blared in the morning, I just shrugged as I got dressed, telling myself it was just a dream as I put my socks on and went downstairs.

Juliet was already awake, sitting at the kitchen table and eating a slice of toast that looked like it was lightly buttered. The mince that I had left on the kitchen side was gone and I don’t know why, but I felt relieved because even if it was real, at least the evidence of it wasn’t waiting for me in the morning.

Upon me coming down, Juliet’s face lightened up as she stood up, wrapping her arms around me and shoving her face onto my shoulder. 

I let out a light chuckle, I couldn’t stop myself. Any worries I had once had were now gone and I could finally focus on the day I had ahead of me.

“Do you have a shift today?” I asked her. I honestly hadn’t expected much of a response so I was plentifully surprised when I got one.

“Nope, I think I’m just going to rest some more today.” My smile brightened warmly as I placed a short kiss on her lips and I got my work shoes on, leaving with a final wave to Juliet. I know some may judge me for this, but for the rest of the day at work, I couldn’t wait to get home. I thought that maybe yesterday had been some mistake or just an off day, my gullible mind did not come from one of naivety, but one of hope and love. Love for my marriage and an everlasting love for my wife. 

My Juliet.  

When I returned home, I came with a stack of tests that needed to be marked and graded, an almost empty coffee cup that was ice cold and a single rose I had gotten from a small market on my way home. Normally, I didn’t get Juliet flowers, she would often tell me there was no need where she would not be at home long enough to water them and it was a waste to spend money on something which decays. A part of me had somewhat agreed, but I still wanted to buy her at least one rose if she was going to be at home for at least a week. 

When I got home and fished my keys out of my pocket, my attempt to unlock the door was cut short when the front door immediately opened from my fingers grazing the wood. 

The pit inside bloomed once more.

Pushing the door open, I scanned the house for any sign of a burglary or an attack, anything that suggested an intruder had been inside.

But there was nothing.

Everything was where I had left it, the only thing that was really missing was Juliet. At first, I thought maybe she had left and forgotten to lock the door but that didn’t sound right, not only because she would have told me if she was going out, but her keys were still on the side where they had been for the last month. I thought maybe she meant to leave them but that didn’t sound like Juliet, even if she had kept the door unlocked on purpose, there would have still been a part of her that would have grabbed the keys out of impulse or as an assurance after the fact.

“Juliet?” I called out, hearing the sound of the bathroom sink turn on at an increased speed, the fact I could hear it so clearly made me realise that it must have been on quite a high setting. Against my better judgement, I rushed up the stairs and opened the bathroom door, a cloud of steam attacking me as soon as the barrier of the door was removed. Waving the steam away, I had finally made it to the source.

Juliet, her hands over the scalding hot water, her forehead dripping with sweat and her eyes rolling into the back of her head.

I acted as fast as I could once the shock had worn off, turning the water off as I grabbed a cloth and wrapped her hands up. Her fingers were completely red and I could see areas in her palms where the skin had begun to blister, separating from her flesh in a hue of yellow and red. I felt sick but I ignored it as we exited the bathroom, taking her downstairs and going towards the door. At that moment, my worries were reignited and any peace that had been given to my mind was gone, I needed to get her to a hospital. 

Juliet didn’t say much during this, her eyes were glazed over and sometimes her mouth would repeatedly open before closing soon after. She wasn’t even screaming, she was just staring, the skin on her hands slipping onto the cloth and leaving her hands a fleshy mess. I focused on driving, I couldn’t bear to even look over. She needed help, and honestly, so did I.

The stay at the hospital wasn’t as long as I expected it to be. When I got her there, her hands were immediately treated as they rushed her into a surgery to try and salvage any skin they could. At the time, a nurse handed me Juliet’s belongings, some of her clothes which were the same she had changed into this morning, as well as her phone. Although I usually wouldn't, I thought this had gone far enough and I looked on her phone until I found a contact that I knew was one of her colleagues, Taylor. 

I didn’t know Taylor well, but I had met her a few times and she always seemed like talking was her favourite activity. She was a bit eccentric, always having at least one pink or fluffy accessory on her and she would often wear a wig which she would dramatically remove to reveal her brightly dyed shaved head. I could understand why Juliet enjoyed spending time with her in such a serious environment.

I rang her quickly, I knew she hadn’t gone on the trip as Juliet would tell me that Taylor had once called in sick because there was a small layer of snow outside and she hated the cold. But even if she hadn’t gone, I knew she still had to know something.

She answered on the second ring.

“Juliet, are you okay?” I let out a sigh, remembering whose phone I was using. The fact that her voice was filled with worry and concern did make me stop for a second, but I imagine she just hadn’t heard from her since before the trip.

“Taylor, It’s Sebastian, I wanted to ask you something.” I heard a sigh from the other side.

“What happened? Is Juliet alright?” Her questions were obviously frantic. It felt odd, I had never heard her like this before.

“I- Well, I don’t know. She’s hurt herself, her hands, God, her hands, Taylor. I don’t know what she was thinking. They’ve taken her in for surgery now and I don’t know what to do.” I knew how I sounded but I didn’t care. I could hear Taylor let out a long sigh, like one you do when you’re trying to hold tears in. But still, I had to ask my question. “Taylor, what happened on that trip?” 

The line went silent for a moment, I could feel myself becoming lost but I kept myself composed, if I broke down now I doubt I would ever recover.

“You mean, she didn’t tell you?” I felt a chill down my spine.

“No, she’s barely said anything. Taylor, just tell me what happened?” 

“Sebastian, she was the only one who returned.” I almost dropped her phone before I gripped it once more, finding an empty chair to sit down on.

“What, what do you mean?” I questioned, trying to not tap my foot like crazy.

“Something happened, they won’t say anything about it but I heard that Noah had to go to identify and collect his father’s body. They say it was the only body they could bring back for identification, the others were too far gone.” I could feel my lips shaking. Noah was Mark’s son. I had seen him yesterday, but Juliet hadn’t even acknowledged what I had said so I dropped it.

“What do you mean too far gone?” I resisted the urge to bite down on my fingernails, instead digging them into the palm of my free hand.

“They were burnt beyond recognition, the bodies are being brought back for autopsy in a few days but identification has been removed from being a priority.” I knew I was shaking, but I didn’t care. I just found out my wife was a sole survivor in a horrific event that killed her friends, burning their bodies, and now she was in surgery for her boiled hands. Was that a coincidence? I had no idea. “There was something else as well. They found a dog.”

“A dog?” Juliet had never mentioned a dog, but then again, it probably wasn’t the first thing on her mind.

“Yeah, it was killed as well, but they found it in the snow, completely burnt. They say it’s likely it was the first killed.” I sighed, this was becoming too unreal. “Sebastian?”

“Yeah?” 

“When Juliet comes out of surgery, can you let her know I called?” I smiled weakly. 

“Sure, thanks Taylor.” I hung up the call and just stared at the blank screen of the phone. The information of the deaths of people I had seen in the office parties I had attended with Juliet felt it was breaking me apart. I couldn’t imagine how Juliet was feeling, losing a team she spent months with throughout the year. 

After a while, a doctor approached me and told me that Juliet was coming out of surgery and that although they had done their best to repair her hands, she would still need to spend time resting to minimise the risk of infection and would need a checkup to ensure she was healing. I felt my heart beating at the doctor’s words but I just nodded along, following along until I was brought to her room. Tears welled up in my eyes as I saw her, bandages wrapped over her hands as she still appeared to be in a dazed state. I felt like crying, I almost did. I sat down next to her bed, placing a hand on her and just sitting. I had already spent hours in the waiting room, but this was different. I had her in front of me, I knew she was safe. 

After an hour, I began to search over her for any other signs of burns, like older ones but I didn’t find one. What I did find however, was still weird.

There was a bite mark, it laid on the middle of her forearm, obviously healed but it was still quite visible. I wondered if it was human but then I noticed how sharp some of the teeth appeared to be and I knew what had bitten her.

A dog.

After seeing it, I went to get her doctor and asked him about the bite. He confirmed what I had believed, it looked like the dog bites he sometimes gets in the emergency room. I asked if a bite like this could cause a change in behaviour, and he just glanced at me and shrugged, telling me that he couldn’t be sure but I would have to keep an eye on her just in case. He left soon after. 

I felt helpless, my wife lying unconscious in a hospital bed and I didn’t even know what was really happening. 

But I knew it had to stop. It had to.

A few weeks later, Juliet was deemed healthy enough to be taken home. I felt relief as I helped her get into the car and she smiled at me. Sure she wasn’t saying a lot, but still, she smiled at me. It was a start. I had the same schedule for her entire stay at the hospital. I would go to work, then immediately to the hospital to see her, before returning home and having a meal before going to sleep and repeating the cycle the next day. I knew I looked tired, even my students had begun to notice. But my wife was worse.

Not only did she look tired, but her eyes looked sunken, her hair was greasy and her frame was pale and small. I thought it was maybe because of the shock she had gone through but it seemed like she was only getting worse. 

When we finally arrived home, I prepared a meal for us, not anything big as I wasn’t sure if she was even up for it but enough that there would still be leftovers the next day if she wanted any.

Well, at least that’s what I thought. 

The moment we sat down, Juliet had begun to eat, ripping into each piece and having a taste of each piece. I had never seen her like this before. It wasn’t exactly scary but I still felt uneasy as she kept eating, using her hands to scoop up the food into a ball and shoving it in, it put me off. 

Unsure, I offered my own plate to her and she took it without a second thought, shovelling my food in and not even daring to say a thank you or give a little nod. I felt sick.

It reminded me of the night with the mince, the way she had eaten it with her fingers, digging in. A part of my mind felt worried, it couldn’t be safe or clean for her to use her hands right now, but it wasn’t like I could stop her.

Grabbing my fork, I pushed a mouthful onto it and offered it to her. She didn’t even bother to look up, taking it out of my hands and biting down hard. I felt a shiver and the pit inside returned once more. 

At one point, she had knocked a butter knife onto the floor and I grabbed it, standing up and taking it to the sink behind her. I felt the warmness of the water and felt sick once more, imagining the water boiling hot and ripping my skin off at its heat and pressure. With a shudder, I placed the butter knife down and turned to face my wife’s back, gently touching her shoulders as my fingers grazed up until I reached her neck. I looked at the window on the other side, seeing the reflection of our faces.

“I love you.” I whispered, it felt like it had been ages since I told her that. 

From my fingers, I traced the back of her neck until I felt a bump across my fingertips. Looking back down, I saw what I had thought I had felt the weeks before.

There was a bump of something crawling under her skin, running up her neck as soon as my fingers touched her skin. While I couldn’t hear it, the sight of it digging through my wife’s skin made my own skin crawl with disgust. I wanted to yell out but I felt frozen, what would I even say? 

My wife must've noticed something was wrong as she put her plate down, pushing her head back to meet my waist. She smiled up at me but I felt nothing.

That wasn’t my wife anymore.

Taking a step back, my wife’s head rolled back around, turning to stand and face me. Her slightly healed hands were bleeding once more, the heat of the food burning through and attacking her, she hadn’t even reacted.

I grabbed a knife from our knife block, a sharp but still quite small knife that I held in front of myself.

“What are you?” I asked her, but she didn’t answer. I hadn’t expected her to, because I knew she wasn’t my wife. 

She rushed towards me but I pushed her away with my arm, watching out as she snarled and bared her teeth as me, like a threat of her bite would make me stop. But it didn’t.

I pushed past her, pushing against her as I kneed her down to the kitchen floor, forcing her to lay on the cold tiles as I located what was inside her. 

It was laying nestled back down into her neck, I imagine it was the area it had built around the most. And while I didn’t really know what I was doing, I still did it.

I took the knife and cut into the back of her neck, being gentle to only cut through the skin as my hands shook. Once I had cut enough, I dug my fingers deeper, going through her skin until I felt something slimy in between my fingers. I pulled, but Juliet then began to fight back. She thrashed worse than before, trying to kick me in the back but I stayed on her. She let out a large scream that hurt my ears, I thought she was going to break our windows with her screams. With a final pull, I took what was between my fingers and pulled it out, letting it lay squished between them as I looked up at it. 

It looked like a worm, or a parasite. I remember Juliet showing me images of parasites to try and freak me out while she was studying. It was long, white with a greenish hue and had sharp teeth at one end that seemed to be covered in red. There were parts of it that appeared bloody, but I could still see it. 

Fear took over me as I looked down at Juliet. Her screaming had stopped, in fact, all her attacks had stopped. The worm I held appeared to still be activated so I did the only thing I knew. I stood up, placed it on the floor, and stamped on the small creature until it was a mess of red and green on the kitchen floor. I went to grab something to clean it up but that was when Juliet’s arm grabbed me. Her fingers were still stained deep red, her fingernails were almost nonexistent and her palm felt like it was sticking to my leg.

“Burn, you have to burn it.” My face contorted into confusion as Juliet turned towards me, a pool of blood slowly leaking out from her neck. “It’s the only way to stop it, please.” Her words got to me because I knew they were her’s. I grabbed a match, lighting it on the matchbox and throwing it onto the mush on the floor. It was like the body ignited the flames more, becoming a large flame in only a few seconds. After setting the fire, I didn’t bother to look at it, I needed to tend to my wife. Her neck was still bleeding but I couldn’t stop it. I placed my hand over the back of her neck to try and keep pressure on it, like I had seen it done before, but I truly did not know. Did I cut too deep? I had wondered as Juliet’s hand went to grab one of mine, sliding her wrist against mine as I turned her over and stared into her eyes.

“I’m sorry.” I whispered to her. She smiled gently, her pale face somehow becoming even more pale. She just kept staring at me.

“I know, Seb, I know.” She just kept smiling, even as the blood pool under her caused my hand to suddenly let go of her neck and a spurt of blood to escape out. I let out a short cry but she just kept smiling, tears welling up in her eyes with each passing second. “It’s okay, it’ll all be okay.” 

That was how the police had found us, my wife on the ground and bleeding, my hands covered in blood and squeezing the back of her neck, a fairly large flame erupting next to us. One of our neighbours must have called them after hearing Juliet’s screams, or maybe after seeing the flame.

The police let paramedics in and they took her away, ripping me away from her and taking me to their car to drive to the station. I could see some firefighters as well to tackle the fire before it got out of hand.

The police had questioned me, asking what had happened. I explained everything. Yes, I know that this would make me sound insane, but I had to tell them. The officers questioning me exchanged a glance before they were called out of the room by another officer. I just sat there, blood staining my hands as they told me that my wife’s injuries had been too severe and had died from a combination of blood loss and shock. I sobbed right there in the station, covering my eyes as the officers told me I was being arrested for murder before I could fully process what was happening.

I screamed at them to stop.

“It wasn’t her! It wasn’t her! Please, I had to save her.” I doubt the officers were even listening anymore as they took me away.

That was five years ago now, but you’re probably wondering what happened after that. Well, I got given a psychiatrist and a lawyer. My lawyer had told me to take an insanity plea but I refused, I wasn’t crazy. I know what happened and while I had killed my wife, it was to save her from that worm inside her. After what felt like a lot of back and forth, I finally gave in and made my plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. 

Truly, I did not believe it would work, and I thought I would get life. I felt like I deserved life. That didn’t happen.

What did happen is I was found not guilty and told to be in a psychiatric facility until it was deemed safe for me to return to society.

I spent two years of my life there, spending every waking moment thinking about that night, the look on my wife’s face. I could barely remember what I had said to her in her final moments. Was I caring enough? It hadn’t felt like it. 

I didn’t get a lot of visitors while I was there. There were times when I wondered if I was even allowed visitors. I had expected my parents or my in-laws, someone to come see me. But they didn’t. To them, I was the messed up history teacher who had a psychotic break and killed his wife. Well, an unemployed history teacher, the high school where I worked made it clear to me that I would never step foot in the school. I knew I was the talk of that school now, and a part of me wondered if I would even keep my licence.

The only person who did visit me whenever she could, was Taylor. Her hair was still shaved, dyed a bright yellow. She wore a dress that had a lemon pattern on it and a small yellow jacket that only covered half her arms. I was amazed she could even keep up her appearance after losing Juliet, I definitely couldn’t. By the time I was finally deemed safe to return, she had dyed her hair three different times. Once to a bright pink, then a dark purple when her attempt to use blue dye didn’t work out and then to a lighter purple soon after. She was my only anchor when I was let out and had nowhere to go, we barely knew each other but now she was letting me stay with her until I could get back on my feet and begin my life again. 

It felt wrong, and it was impossible for me to get a job when they discovered what happened when they searched my name. But, I still made it work. I became an online history tutor for a few months, making money by teaching people online, but it wasn’t going to help at all. I still had my bank account from before I was arrested, but me and Juliet always had separate accounts so the amount in mine was significantly less than what I imagine was still in her’s. A part of me never wanted to do anything again, that this is what I deserve for what I did. But after a bit more digging, I found a place that would allow me to be a cleaner for them, working night shifts only. It felt good to have a job again, and after a while working there, as well as my tutoring and some help from Taylor, I was able to get a small apartment. And since then, I’ve been living here ever since. 

My parents still haven’t visited me but that was alright, I understood why. I think I saw one of my old students a few days ago but I didn’t even try to say hello. It was better that they didn’t know where I was living now. I haven’t dared think about dating again, it’s not something I’d ever want to even consider. Me and Juliet were together for over ten years, a part of me wants to say fifteen years but I know that’s not true, she’s gone. I had asked Taylor what happened to the home, our home, but she just shrugged it off and told me that Juliet’s parents had sold it not long after her death and to not worry about it anymore. But that’s all I did everyday. I know that some people believe I should have gotten a longer sentence, that I should have been in there for the rest of my life, but what they didn’t understand is I already had a life sentence: guilt. 

Guilt is something I live with everyday for what happened, knowing it is something I can never take back. I had done what was needed in order to try and save my wife, and it had resulted in failure. 

I had spent years of my life in that facility, being told that what I had seen wasn’t real. That I had gone crazy, killed my wife over something I thought I had seen and then tried to cover up what I had done by burning the place down. 

That wasn’t what happened, but they didn’t care. 

This is where I leave this chapter of my life. Part of me wants to believe that it was just an episode I had gone through, that I hadn’t seen anything but I knew I had. I knew what had happened and what was going to happen to me if she had bit down on me like that dog did to her. But for now, I just need to be told that I did see something, that there was something which I had cut out of her and had lightened. I tried to ask Taylor about it but she acted like it never happened, like it wasn’t her that let me know what happened to my wife’s team out there. So, I put it to you, I need to move on with my life but I can’t do that until I know that what I saw was real and not my mind playing tricks on me once more. I’m sorry for what I have done, but I need to find a way to keep myself feeling sane for once.

The compound pharmacy used was Lexington compound pharmacy in Lexington Kentucky. The instructions were to inject 0.44mL (0.44mg = 44 units) weekly for a month. I had zero issues. Light nausea and it did trigger my Gerd, but all of this was something I could work with. I was able to go about my day without worry.

My Dr eventually notified me that they were no longer allowed to prescribe it to me, so I had to go through a third party. My new pharmacy is through orderly meds. The new dose is 0.10mL weekly. Last night I took it before bed so that if I had any nausea, I’d sleep it off, like I did with my previous prescription. Well I was wrong. Not only did I wake up feeling like complete shit, I threw up. I took nausea meds, which have helped. And I ate some plain saltine crackers and have been drinking water. I felt like I was back to normal. Wrong again. I made coffee and eggs a few hours later because I was feeling weak and I drink coffee every morning. I feel like I need to lay down. Thank GOD I work from home. I don’t feel good at all. I’m hoping that this is normal for the first day. 

I am assuming the new prescription is more concentrated so maybe that’s also why I’m feeling like this. 

Honestly it probably doesn’t help that I’m on my period also. I think I just straight up fucked myself here. So please, any nausea tips or personal experiences, Please send them my way. ",0,1765815700.0,SemaglutideFreeSpeech,0,0.5,False
