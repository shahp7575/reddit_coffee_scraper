1iq79z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalroad/comments/1iq79z5/thoughts_after_250000_views_some_numbers_stuff_i/,"Thoughts After 250,000 Views (some numbers, stuff I got wrong, and a thank-you)","This definitely counts as self-promo, so that's the tag.  
  
I'm celebrating here with a bit of coffee and ice cream. After 4.5 months and 225k words / 92 chapters, Flux Core hit a quarter-million views. It's also a bit over 1250 followers and 275 favorites. The story has a 4.36 average over 165 ratings and 24 reviews. One of my favorite stats, honestly, is that we're over 900 comments.

  
The story definitely isn't everyone's favorite - more than a few reviews prove that point. But as a first-time writer, I'm happy with all of the readers enjoying and keeping up with things. I've also realized how poorly I managed the initial release. The story's ability to spend time on RS and its traction happened ***despite*** my efforts, not because of them.

Things I got wrong: would change if I were talking to myself back before I hit publish on CH1- 

* **I didn't prep enough content**. I thought I did. There were 60k words written out in a word doc - except I ended up rewriting most of that as I started to publish, but published anyway because I was excited about the story. I think the changes made benefitted the story, but there was no reason I needed to wait until I started publishing to make those changes. If I had enough solid, reliable content done on day 1, it would've saved me from other issues. *If I do end up writing another story someday, I'll be starting out with at least the first book entirely written.*
* **I expected to have editing time each week.** Yeah. knock-on from the first point, but it immediately hit me in the face. The second week of the story, I was supposed to be visiting family in another state. Then we had a hurricane coming at us and had to evacuate. *Backlog solves this, but I could've also had a 'Sunday deadline' for the coming week's chapters.*
* **Too many review swaps**. As a babe in the woods, I started doing review swaps, and I did too many. I do think I got some good advice from other authors - but if I'd been active in any writing communities, I could've had that same kind of feedback from them. *I assumed review swaps would be this amazing way to get the story discovered, but it really just left me spending time reading and reviewing other stories - time I should've been writing.*
* **Lack of shoutouts.** Shoutouts felt intimidating. It was audacious to jump into another author's PM's on RR and see if I could swap with them. I still criminally underutilize shoutouts - my recent ones have all come from other authors reaching out to me. But supporting other stories is fun, and it's a numbers game. If I say yes to 10 shoutouts, one of them might get on RS. When I did start doing shoutouts, I got really lucky that way. I did an early exchange with Spell Weaver, and that story (deservedly) did really well on RS. So what does that mean now? *That shoutout still sends 50 users to Flux Core each week*. Others are still good for 3-8 views per week, ongoing. *Those stats add up over time, so every shoutout is worth it.*
* **Giving negative feedback too much brain space.** I'm lucky. I have readers who are reliably active in comments, and they give me a tftc or mention things they enjoy, even now. But first starting off, I over-focused on the negative feedback I received, as well as what I viewed as negative. I saw the drive-by 0.5's and 'this sucks' commentary, and had an urge to 'fix' things. The issue was, those people were never ""my readers"" - not really. And I can't prioritize what someone thinks the story should be over what it is. *Everyone has preferences, and it took me a while to find the self-confidence to ignore the people that want a story to fit in their specific box.*
* **Unclear Blurb.** I didn't have any peer review on the story's blurb, and it gave more than one person a false impression of what they were getting into. I had to tailor it based on negative comments and reviews once people realized where the disconnect was, but that would've been avoided if I were smarter. *Next time, I'd seek out advice on blurb content before publishing*. 

  
So, almost everything there boils down to 'write book 1, and be in a community'. It's that simple. Don't get overexcited about the idea of sharing the story like I did. Readers are going to benefit more from a well-planned release.   
  
I also would've loved to get a proper cover (I still need to commission one), but like every other first-timer, I struggled to find the money to pay for something, and instead went with an AI placeholder that got 'close enough' to what I wanted.

I thought about adding the idea of 'no patreon' in that list, but I'm not qualified to give advice there. There are tons of guides and threads on how to do it right, and as someone who *still* hasn't started offering advanced chapters (sorry, y'all) I don't believe I should be giving advice on that topic. The only thing I can say is having book 1 written would've given me the opportunity to give it a try.



Things that went alright-

* **I ticked the right boxes**. Flux core got traction in part because it fell into the 'right' genre on RR. It's a system apocalypse, LitRPG, Progression Fantasy story. I wrote it that way because it was what I wanted to write. If the story had been any different, I don't think it would be where it is today.
* **First Chapter Pull.** I've had more than a few people tell me the first chapter was great, or brought a tear to their eye. There's also mixed comments, but I think the number of people that engaged with the story is good, and so I'm putting this one in the 'went right' bucket. 
* **Landing the plane.** This might be a controversial statement to some of my (former) readers, but I believe I pulled the end of book 1 together properly and in the way I needed to see it done. It's such an important setup for the rest of the story, and I was initially very worried about doing it well.  



Despite all the issues I created for myself, Flux Core still made it onto genre-specific RS somewhere around November 7th. The story peaked at 31st on RS main, 27th on the Fantasy list, 26th for Adventure, and 25th for Action. Nothing noteworthy, but still a hell of an ego boost for a first-time writer.



*So, thanks to everyone active here and on the RR forums. Both communities have helped steer me away from some of these issues as I've continued to write. They've given me advice and a place to commiserate, even if I don't post as much as others. Y'all rock.*  
  
**If any of you are Flux Core readers, thanks for taking the journey with me so far. People enjoying your writing really is a singularly rewarding experience, and I appreciate all of you.**

1iq75v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1iq75v7/what_additional_coverage_do_we_need/,What additional coverage do we need?,"We are 59 & 60 years old, retired and live in Virginia.  PNW around 3.5 mil. We live on 4 rural acres in a quiet community at the end of a dead-end street - no HOA. No teenage kids. No pool, trampoline or dogs. We have 6 beehives (fenced in) and a feral cat colony (9 cats) on the property.  The cats are terrified of humans and will not get close to anyone, but I suppose they would be considered a risk factor. We are safe drivers - no accidents or tickets in decades. I think we’re a pretty low risk couple. 

We have excellent coverage on our USAA auto policy and a top-notch homeowner’s carrier that cannot be beat. But I am concerned that we might be under-insured. I started looking into what additional coverage we might need. Now my head hurts!

Someone suggested an umbrella policy. It appears most “umbrella” policies are actually extended liability policies - simply adding coverage to what home and auto already provide. 

But “true” umbrella policies are a slightly different animal. True umbrella policies offer broader coverage, but I am struggling to determine how much more they cover and if I need one. It appears that true umbrella policies cover you against libel & slander where extended liability policies do not. But I’m not especially worried about that as I’m pretty low-key and know how to keep my trap shut. I’m more interested in protecting our assets from inadvertent accidents.

I understand that most major accident scenarios would be covered by auto or homeowners insurance. Things like a catastrophic auto accident or someone falling on my house. Sidewalk and suing would be covered by those policies.

However, I don’t think homeowners/auto would cover me if I caused an accident of some sort, unrelated to my house or car. For example, if I tripped carrying a cup of hot coffee in a restaurant and caused someone burns/injury, I don’t believe I would be covered by my home or auto policy. Is this incorrect thinking on my part?

If I were to accidentally break an expensive piece of furniture at a bed & breakfast, or someone’s home or a store? If I sold a heater on eBay and someone got hurt using it? If I gave a plant to a friend whose cat ate it and then died? All kinds of accidents can happen in life…

Would a “true” umbrella cover me in these scenarios? 

I’m also looking at UM/UIM policies but don’t know if we need one of those or not. We have health insurance with a very high deductible, but if we had a catastrophic accident, we could pay it. Should we consider this type of coverage?

Simply trying to protect our assets.  Much thanks to any advice you can offer. ",1,1739642516.0,Insurance,0,1.0,False

I was also considering the Oxo 8 cup, mainly due to the bloom brewing feature, but I love the KBT design and simplicity. 

I was torn over whether to get a hot plate model, as I often brew 6-8 cups and drink over a couple of hours. No need though, with the insulated KBT carafe I just insert the travel cap right after brewing and it stays plenty hot.

The Fellows Ode 2 grinder is quite a machine as well. Started with setting at about 7.1 and will experiment from there.  Coming from a cheap blade grinder and a Cuisanart brewer, this gear is quite the step up. As is the coffee, it really is much better.

Just one OCD observation on the KBT, I noticed the brew flow is not hitting the center of the brewing cap, but lands just off to side. Nothing spills, it’s just not a “nothing but net” drip into pot. Tried shifting the carafe and filter basket, and will play around some more, but wondering if anyone else has noticed this. Again, just a small OCD comment.

After rounding the Darién Gap by sailboat to Cartagena was a 500-mile marathon along la Ruta del Sol. Heat indexes pushed +120°F [48°C] through Mompox toward Bucaramanga. Eight liters of water each day still wasn’t enough. The cold couldn’t come sooner. And then it stayed forever.
 
Each passing day brought new personal records for highest mountain passes. First the wintry páramos of Colombia’s Northeastern Cordillera. Purple bricks of bocadillo [guava paste] became my saving grace.
 
Then the Trampoline of Death between two militant valleys en route towards the Trans Ecuador Volcano Corridor. I crashed atop Chimborazo when the winds grew too strong. Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn’t always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. “No way, I could never,” as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel. It’s been perhaps the most beautiful part of the journey from Alaska to Argentina thus far, but also the most backbreakingly difficult. You reach your physical and emotional capacity by 5pm each day, yet have no choice but to throw yourself past it week after week for months without letup. Your body crumbles over and over, but there’s nowhere to escape to and no way to get there.
 
From up above the clouds, each payoff remains breathtaking. Camp colors, indelible. Ahead lie Bolivia, Chile and Argentina still. It just might take some time to come down.

1iq6z9e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iq6z9e,Double chocolate cherry loaf,"Made this for my wife for Valentine’s Day. Overproofed it a little but I prefer that to Underproofing any day. Anyway here is the recipe if you want to try it, definitely tastes and has mouth feel of cake more-so than bread. Almost like  chocolate muffin texture. 

Even at 86% overall hydration this was stiff, I think owing all to the dark cacao. The coffee really brought out a nice chocolatey flavor. If you try this and just do water the Dutch cacao can actually make it taste fairly bitter, highly recommend the coffee. 

Recipe:
- 500g bread flour
- 150g brewed coffee (room temp)
- 275g water room temp
- 100g mature bubbly starter
- 11g sea salt
- 150g chocolate chips (1/2 dark, 1/2 semisweet) 
- 1 can dark sweet cherries

Process: 
- Empty cherries from can and rinse and then press and squeeze them in some paper towels to get rid of whatever moisture you can, trust me they’ll still be plenty wet 
- mix flour, water, coffee to a rough mix and autolyse for 30 mins
- add starter and salt and mix Rubaud method for 7-8 minutes
- rest 30 minutes
- add cherries and chocolate chips and do first stretch and fold
- rest 30 mins
- 2nd stretch and fold
- rest 30 mins
- 3rd stretch and fold and tossed into bulk ferment container
- bulk fermented to about 50-55% rise since it was at about 75-76 degrees
- ordinary shaping and basketing
- counter proofed since I was doing this on Valentine’s Day (kind of hard to tell when proofing is just right because of all the inclusions)
- oven preheated to 540, then baked in DO 15 mins lid on at 460, then 15 mins lid off at 460

Hi guys! New to the subreddit and thought I'd share my desk display!

I bought my first fragrance when I was in my first year of university but I would say my collecting habits didn't start until maybe 2.5 years ago (I'm 25,M for reference). Started off with the designers and what not, but then slowly started getting into the niche. I will say there's no rhyme or reason as to what kind of scents/notes I gravitate to - if it smells good, I'm good lol (even if it leans feminine!). Now onto my display - I'll go from top to bottom, left to right. You'll see that I also display some of the tester/travel size bottles and that's only because if I don't, I'll forget I have it and won't reach for it (they deserve love too). I'll describe my full bottles and any travel/sample bottles if I there's something significant I want to say about it :)

**Hermès - H24 EDP** // this is going to be my go-to reach once spring/summer comes back! Fresh, green, clean.

**Dior - Homme EDT** // i'll be honest, i'm so confused on the iterations of the EDT and parfum.. I think I have the EDT? I settled on the EDT once I found out that I probably won't be able to find the parfum before the 2025 version. However this is my current daily go-to scent. Woody, boozy - an easy reach for any occasion.

**YSL - MYSLF EDP** // the bergamot/citrus-y vibes slap you in the face on the initial spray, but then cradles you after and calms you down. A very interesting masculine-floral scent that I very much enjoy. To me there's something really loud about it though - I'll really only wear this to parties/club nights, etc. I can see this leaning very synthetic-y for others, but for me but I don't mind it all.

**YSL - Y EDT** // my very first fragrance I bought on my own, the one that started it all. Blue fragrance that's an easy reach; fresh and clean for me. My ""nostalgia"" scent for me as its been with me through many first dates, milestone celebrations, family events, etc.

**YSL - Babycat EDP** // saw the hype for this. Constantly went back and forth into Holt Renfrew testing it over a couple of months. Finished a 2ml sample. Bit the bullet - do not regret it at all. This is a dark spicy vanilla wearing a trenchcoat. Absolutely love it.

**Loewe - 7 Cobalt EDP** // My favourite blue fragrance i have! The pink pepper note really sticks out and makes it a more interesting blue fragrance for me. A summer go-to.

**Jo Malone - Cypress & Grapevine cologne intense** // ""dark and fresh"" is the only way I can describe this one. I'll be honest, I don't really wear this one as much - but I should. Tom Hardy now pops into my mind every time I reach for it.

**Versace - The Dreamer cologne** // This was a gift when I was in highschool I think - not gonna lie I don't reach for it as often any more. Fresh and slightly green to me.

**Shiro - Spice of Life EDP** // Went to Japan last year and Shiro is a very popular brand there. This one is a dry rose floral type vibe. I'll be honest the opening kind of reminds me of church incense, BUT the dry down is sooo good. Makes me wonder how many internationally-available brands I'm missing out on!!

**Montblanc - Explorer EDP** // got this because my bf at the time said it smelled really good on me when I tried it on at some store lol. Did not know it was considered an alternative for creed aventus at the time. I wear this one when meeting people for the first time, going out at night, etc - it's a confidence booster. Smoky and fresh.

**Diptyque - Benjoin Bohème EDP** // First amber fragrance I really liked. There's something spicy in the opening for me - dries down into something woody, warm and cozy. Amazing cold weather scent.

**Diptyque - L'eau Papier EDT** // One of my all time favourites. ""Steamed rice"" is absolutely correct. Sesame, musky, cozy. Great skin scent in my opinion. There's something so comforting about this when I spray it on me. Great for layering. Great great great all around. 

* Notable samplers - orpheon - clean and powery, might get a full bottle // eau di lierre - smells like you crushed grass and dandelion stems in your hand, but wonderful, nostalgic sweet dry down 

**Chanel - Bleu de Chanel EDP** // This was a gift! Classic blue fragrance. What I recommend to my guy friends if they ask what to start off with. Fresh and versatile. Easy wear. Good for any occasion!

**MM Replica - By the Fireplace EDT** // My go-to reach during these winter months. Smoky, woody, vanilla-y, smells exactly like the name. Finished a travel sized before getting a full bottle. Only drawback is that I can't smell it on me anymore after an hour. But I'm attributing that to noseblindness after a while.

**Tom Ford - Oud Wood EDP** // Maybe I'm the clown, but this one is polarizing. Loved it in store after testing it a couple times. But now I rarely wear it :/ Woody, sweet, dark, and I get something vanilla-y in the dry down. I will say though - whenever I get ""you smell so good"" compliments, its when I'm wearing this one!!

**Tom Ford - Ombré Leather EDP** // Another slap in the face of smokey leather but dries down lovely. I reach for this one a lot during spring/summer months.

**Byredo - Rose of No Man's Land** // I walked into the store one day and decided to be a menace and asked for a feminine floral that wasn't too feminine/floral and was recommended this LOL. If you're looking for a rose scent that isn't too overbearing, I would recommend this one. Great in the summer.

**Le Labo - Thé Noir 29 EDP** // Figgy, woody, what I imagine the colour violet would smell like. On my skin, beast mode performance.

**Le Labo - Another 13 EDP** // Love-hate relationship with this one. Tested it in store, couldn't smell it. Tested it some more, could finally smell it and loved it. Bought a bottle and wore it out, got a headache. A year later, no more headaches AND it's one of my most complimented scents. 

**Le Labo - Santal 33 EDP** // This one was a gift. Not gonna lie all I smelled was pickles when I first got it. BUT now after coming back to it, I still smell pickles ONLY in the opening. The dry down is absolutely my favourite part. I get leather vibes from this. What a menace of a fragrance lol.

**CLEAN Reserve** \- Got this very recently - Pack of 4 5ml bottles from Sephora.  Current likes are Rain (fresh, blue, clean-girl/boy aesthetic) and Skin (musky, powdery), and whipped cherry (sweet, creamy cherry gourmand).

**Commodity - Milk Expressive EDP** // What got me aboard the gourmand bandwagon. Finished the 10mL travel size you see on the left and bought a larger size the same day (would've gotten the 100ml, but my local Sephora only had the 30ml in stock). I would drink this if I could. Milk-y, woody marshmallow-y goodness. 10/10. I'm wearing this during the summer I don't even care. So SO good. Highly recommend if you're thinking about trying Commodity or wanting a ""darker"" not-too-sweet  gourmand in general. Tbh, this might be my current favourite in my whole collection.

**The 7 Virtues - Amber Vanilla EDP** // A very pleasant and cozy, ""second skin"" kind of vanilla. I get a VERY very light pencil shavings note somewhere in there. Could wear this to the office.

**Phlur** \- Deluxe trio set, 3 x 5ml EDPs from Sephora. Father Figure // my absolute favourite, more masculine leaning fig/musk vibe. Vanilla Skin // not too complicated, sweet and sugar-y for me. Missing Person // not a fan of this one tbh, gave it away to my younger cousin.

**Glossier - You EDP** // Clown me all you want, I love this one and might get a full bottle. It's a better you-scent if you drowned in pencil shavings. Iris and powdery/musky. Easy wear.

Orris Labs - My partner and I went to a perfume making class and we made each other's. This is a honey bomb lol. Love it :)

**Acqua di Parma - Colonia Club EDC** // If fresh, citrusy and minty are your vibe, I highly recommend this. Perfect for the summer!

**Henry Rose - Dave EDP** // A very unique vanilla gourmand for me. It's smells ""thick"" to me in a good way. I get some sort of cream vibes from this. Not too sugar-y or sweet. I think this is the brand's newest release, and I can see this becoming popular. Might get a full bottle of this.

Scentsplit decants!! (My excuse to try out more viral gourmands)

* **Maison Mataha - Escapade gourmand EDP** // syrup-y vanilla, yet not too overbearingly sweet. Might get a full bottle if it wasn't so HARD TO FIND.
* **D'Annam - White Rice EDP** // another cozy, comforting, nostalgic, clean skin scent. Will try and get a full bottle if the brand ever drops a restock :')  (has anyone tried vietnamese coffee??)
* **Escentric Molecules - Molecule 01 + Black Tea EDT** // tried molecule 01 in store SO many times and I might as well have been spraying water on me. Could NOT smell it. This though? The tea note is so SO good, refreshing, and addictive. Will be getting a full bottle of this sometime for the summer.
* **Tihota - Indult EDP** // Plain jane vanilla scent, but done CORRECT. I'll be honest I couldn't smell this at first and got disappointed, but after trying and trying, I can smell it now. And I like it!
* **Mancera - Amore Caffè EDP** // syrupy coffee vanilla brown sugar goodness. Full bottle worthy for me.
* **Giardini di Toscana - Bianco Latte EDP** // my favourite fragrance YouTuber loves this and it went viral, so I got it a 9mL decant. I'll be honest, it's always a 50/50 for me when I spray it on. The coumarin stings the back of my nose on initial spray and that always annoys me. Some days I feel it's too synthetic, some days I absolutely adore it. In terms of the actual scent itself, I think it's a more unique gourmand from what I've put my nose on before.
* **Obvious Parfums - Un Été EDP** // oh my dearest, matcha cookies and tea love <3 Reminds of me summer and cold iced tea drinks in the hot weather. Ending my collection notes on this one because it's so SO good. Full bottle worthy.

  
And that's that on that. Apologies - I didn't realize how LONG this became. I still consider myself an amateur fragrance enthusiast and still trying to better my nose and expand my tastes. This year my goal is to try and smell more niche stuff, like the ones where you can only smell by ordering decants online. I should mention that I'm Canadian, from Ontario - and where I am, there are only so many places to sample niche brands so I have to order decants/sample sizes from sites like scentsplit, lucky scent, etc. Oh and I think I'll try and get into middle eastern houses too!

Our values, thoughts, and beliefs, our financial and health circumstances, our fears, desires, and relationships - they all fit together to create a whole and unique tapestry of identity. The puzzle never really ends though. For better or for worse, as we go we find empty spots, we find new pieces that may or may not appear to belong. Sometimes you can tell immediately, other times you have to scan the board for a bit, or place some other pieces first. A perfect fit would be great but a potential or near fit is almost just as exciting. I'll describe the board from a distance:

My life is simple, I suspect many might find it boring; I like it that way, but it does get lonely. I work full time and usually spend whatever cognition is left over in low key activities - watching tv, reading, playing a video game - things like that. If the mood strikes I might work on a little project here and there, those are usually technology related in some fashion, occasionally crafty. My adventures are mild - going to that one coffee place or restaurant, a relaxing walk, or perusing a thrift or a book store. Larger adventures aren't off the table, but I don't pine for them.

I want to say that my wants and needs in a relationship are also simple but I know better. Everyone must feel that way about themselves, it's all relative. Down to brass tacks - I'm looking for mutual attraction and I don't think this can typically be ascertained without just jumping into it. I want to both desire and be desired, to hear the latest work and family gossip and about that thing you're strangely interested in or that unpopular opinion you have. What's the inner narrative that runs throughout your day? I want to know about your successes, failures, and struggles no matter the magnitude. I want to support and be supported and be nudged in the right direction when I'm wrong. I want to spend time together, even if we're focused on our own interests, but have a common goal that we work towards.

That’s all to say, I’m looking for someone who I think is like me and in a similar place as me. Someone who might routinely feel on the outside looking in, who's content with a simple and largely domestic lifestyle. Someone who considers themselves more on the introverted side and is kind, honest, curious, quiet, modest, humble, observant, reserved, and stable. You tend to avoid busy and loud spaces and unknown situations probably give you a bit of anxiety, so you strategize as much as possible before making your move. You tend to overthink and overanalyze by nature. When you like someone you want to know precisely how their mind works and with every probing question, observation, and discussion, you add a component to your schematic. Eventually, words aren't necessary but, for now, words are all that's available here. You’re not perfect, and that’s fine - I’ve got a long way to go, maybe we can help each other on the way?

I'm not particularly interested in more pen pals, so if you respond then there should be an intent at pursuing something real, eventually, in whatever form that may take. I don't care what we talk about, everything we say will be novel and therefore interesting. I want to know everything anyways, from the most mundane choice to the deepest thought. Ideally, we will both be open to discussing anything.

My preference would be to exchange pictures early to establish mutual attraction as, unfortunately, this is important to me and I find that I'm somewhat selective - Sorry, I don’t make the rules. That's always awkward, but let's both agree up front that's it's nothing personal, everyone has their types. [Here's some of me](https://imgur.com/a/7QgEOIx) so that you can decide beforehand. Additionally, in the vein of dealbreakers:

* I'm 5'9"", ISFJ personality type, physically average/lean.
* I've historically had a habit of forming anxious attachments when I get interested. I'm working on it and making progress, but in the meantime, if you know that you have avoidant tendencies then you should know it's going to be a rough go between us.
* If you're not in a place where you can make an honest attempt at engaging in conversation, maybe reconsider reaching out.
* Not really interested in politics.
* I’m not religious, but enjoy it as a subject.
* I don't dislike pets or animals, but pet ownership feels strange to me.
* I’ve transitioned from smoking cigarettes to vaping. I don't love that, but that's where I'm at presently, so maybe don't respond if you find that distasteful.
* Don't enjoy 420 or other drugs really, but find that a night out drinking can be fun.",2,1739641953.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I’m turning 40 in May and I’m looking to plan a special holiday with my wife (we have two kids who will be staying with my parents while we go away for two weeks). Although my family means the world to me, for this milestone I just want to get away with my wife – no big party or celebrations, just some time for us.

For context, my wife loves relaxing, all-inclusive beach holidays, while I’m more into adventurous trips, especially ones focused on wildlife. For our honeymoon, we did a safari in South Africa, followed by an all-inclusive resort in Mauritius, so we’ve got a bit of a mix of interests.

I’ve been looking into Costa Rica for our trip, as it seems like a good balance of both adventure and relaxation. I’ve been offered an itinerary for two weeks which is touristy (I know not what everyone here would choose), but I’m wondering if it’s a good deal, especially considering the cost.

The total cost is around £6000 for both of us, including flights, for May. We’re from the UK, so it’s a long trip, but the timing works well for us. We could do June or November too, but May seems to offer the best weather.

I've gone for a tourof the country, followed by a week all-inclusive in the hope I get the wildlife and andenture for me and the relaxation and chill for her (and me too).

Before I book, I’d love to hear your thoughts:

- **Is £6000 for both of us a good value for the two-week itinerary, including flights?**
- **Would you suggest anything to do or avoid in Costa Rica?**
- **Do you think it’s worth booking a packaged tour like this, or would we be better off arranging things ourselves?**

I really want my wife to have a great time, and I’m hoping to get your honest opinions and advice. Thanks so much!

Here is the suggested itinerary

1 night San Jose
2 nights Tortuguero

After rounding the Darién Gap by sailboat to Cartagena was a 500-mile marathon along la Ruta del Sol. Heat indexes pushed +120°F [48°C] through Mompox toward Bucaramanga. Eight liters of water each day still wasn’t enough. The cold couldn’t come sooner. And then it stayed forever.
 
Each passing day brought new personal records for highest mountain passes. First the wintry páramos of Colombia’s Northeastern Cordillera. Purple bricks of bocadillo [guava paste] became my saving grace.
 
Then the Trampoline of Death between two militant valleys en route towards the Trans Ecuador Volcano Corridor. I crashed atop Chimborazo when the winds grew too strong. Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn’t always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. “No way, I could never,” as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel. It’s been perhaps the most beautiful part of the journey from Alaska to Argentina thus far, but also the most backbreakingly difficult. You reach your physical and emotional capacity by 5pm each day, yet have no choice but to throw yourself past it week after week for months without letup. Your body crumbles over and over, but there’s nowhere to escape to and no way to get there.
 
From up above the clouds, each payoff remains breathtaking. Camp colors, indelible. Ahead lie Bolivia, Chile and Argentina still. It just might take some time to come down.

At my physical last Monday, my PCP put me on Lisinopril (10mg). She wants me on BP meds for 6 weeks, when we will have a follow up. It caused extreme fatigue and coughing, so she called in Losartan, 50mg tablets. I took a dose last night, then read many horror stories about it on the internet. 

This morning my BP was 106/61. I feel a little dizzy, my heart beat occasionally feels very strong, and I have awful gut pain. 

I need to lose weight. After my checkup, I reached out to a nutritionist friend who put together a plant based meal plan. I've already lost 3 pounds. I've reduced sodium and caffeine intake.

It's like I went from being in decent shape to the worst of my life. How am I going to get healthy if I constantly feel like crap from my meds?

I normally use silicone caps, but with such a fine grind and maybe having them sit around longer after filling, I may get some foil lids for this. Now to the real question of whether it's worth it.

For those who also drink real espresso, either from Original pods or elsewhere AND have tasted Vertuo ""espresso"", how big did you judge to be the difference? I'm not a card-carrying espresso person, but I'd like it to be some reasonable approximation.

I’m heading to Florence next Saturday for 3 nights before moving on to Rome, and I’m feeling completely overwhelmed. There are too many museums, cafés, and restaurants to fit into such a short trip, and I’m starting to consider just going without a plan.

I’ve read through so many posts and ended up with over 40 restaurants and cafés, plus more than 8 attractions, and now I have to narrow them down and create an itinerary—while also making reservations.

Since most recommendations seem to come from here, I’m a bit skeptical that they’ll match my expectations, as I’m from a Mediterranean country and already familiar with many of these flavors.

I need help filtering things down. I’m looking for:

* Three great dinner spots
* Four must-visit cafés or bakeries
* Good quality fast food or casual restaurants for lunch

I'm throwing out a feeler to see if anyone would be interested in starting a stock investing/trading group in Appleton (and fox valley).

It's become clear to me as a 40yr old guy, that it is a struggle to meet and keep friends with common interests. I've taken a very big interest in investing over the past 7 years and I'm looking to connect with people who have the same passion and would like to make new friends!

The idea would be to meet up periodically at a sports bar, coffee shop, etc and just chat about investment ideas. The wins, losses, and ideas. I think it would be great to have people of all levels, so we can learn from each other!

I'd love for this to become more of a social gathering with a similar stock interest, than a wall street bet or crypto platform.

\++++++++

**^(\[Subject: Samuel, King of Mel Dagon\])**

I sat upon the throne, but today felt heavier than usual.

Not because of the matters of the state... those were routine, predictable. The same disputes, the same council meetings filled with familiar voices saying familiar things. I could leave them in my advisor's hands for a day, the kingdom would not falter.

No, the weight was different. Heavier in ways no decree could lift.

I ran a hand over the armrest, fingers tracing the ornate carvings. Symbols of...

Lineage. Strength. Duty.

But, none of those things could unlock a simple wooden door.

...

The palace halls stretched before me in polished marble and velvet banners, as I stood from my throne. My steps carried me on their own, knowing the way all too well. Past the guards who straightened at my approach, past the servants who lowered their heads in respect. None of them stopped me. None of them needed to ask where I was going.

And then, there it was. *The Door*.

Plain and unassuming, but mightier than any fortress I've seen.

I raised my hand.

Knocked once.

Silence.

...

""Would you like to take a walk, my dear?"" I asked, my voice steady. Even. A father speaking to his daughter, not a king issuing a command.

The candlelight flickered beneath the door. Movement. I knew she was listening.

But the silence stretched long, like a lingering wound that refused to heal.

""I thought we might visit the gardens,"" I continued. ""Your mother's roses are still in bloom.""

Nothing.

...

I let the words hang, knowing they would not change anything. Not yet... perhaps not ever.

She did not refuse food, did not refuse comfort when given freely. But me? I was the one and only exception. The one voice she would not answer.

I could not force my way in. I would never.

So I stood there, hand still hovering near the doorframe, listening to the sound of my own breath.

I had seen the grief in her eyes, but it was not grief alone. There was something sharper beneath it. An unspoken dagger to my heart.

Blame.

The realization was not new, but it hurt all he same.

She blamed me.

...And perhaps she was right to.

A king should have been able to prevent such loss. A husband should have been there when it mattered. A father should have been strong enough to hold his family together.

I had done none of those things.

I took a step back.

""If you change  your mind,"" I said, softer now, ""I will be in the city.""

Nothing.

...

Only the flickering of candlelight, the quiet of a door that had long since closed.

I turned and walked away.

—

""She's still been giving you the silent treatment, eh Elric?""

I sighed, rolling my shoulders as my disguise artist fastened the last of the clasps on my borrowed identity. A simple coat, rougher than what I normally wore. A patch sewn over the shoulder, as if to hide an old tear. A hat, slightly misshapen, like it had been worn for years.

The finishing touch was the face. Subtle shadows drawn beneath the cheekbones, a slight alteration in my hair was combed. Nothing dramatic. Just enough to dull the sharp edges of recognition.

""Yes,"" I finally answered, voice heavy. ""And I expect it will continue for some time yet.""

The artist gave a knowing grunt as he stepped back, brushing his hands off. ""Kids can be stubborn. Especially ones who lost their mother.""

I frowned. ""I didn't come here for wisdom, Gavrin.""

""And yet, you always leave with it.""

I scoffed, adjusting my sleeves. ""I'll be back before nightfall.""

Gavrin made a vague gesture of farewell before returning to his tools, already preparing for his next commission. I left the small, hidden chamber behind, stepping through the palace's back corridors until the word of kings and courts faded into the hum of the city.

—

The Trade District was alive with the steady rhythm of commerce. Merchants called their wares, coins changed hands, and the smell of fresh bread mingled with the spice of imported goods.

I walked among them as one of their own. A simple man in a crowd, unnoticed, unseen.

There was pride in that.

Not just in my disguise, but in the city itself. The roads well-kept, the market stalls brimming with goods, the people moving with a sense of security. No war, no famine.

Harmony.

A fragile thing, hard-earned.

I made my way toward my usual spot. A modest coffee shop tucked between two larger buildings, its wooden sign slightly faded. The scent of roasted beans greeted me before I even stepped inside.

And there, seated just outside the familiar corner table, was an even more familiar face.

""*Elric!*, you old bastard."" The man greeted with a knowing grin, swirling his cup in one hand. ""I was starting to think you'd forgotten me.""

""Never, Renald,"" I said, taking the seat beside him. ""You're the only man I know who's made an entire fortune off of Baxxid fashion.""

Renald chuckled, setting his cup down. ""Well you know them. They love their systems. And if you can convince a certain Trademaster your silk is the best for those headpieces, you've got yourself a lifelong contract.""

He gestured with his hands, mimicking the scythe-like arms of the Baxxid. ""Red for guards, green for laborers, blue for social ones, and purple for guides...- A perfect, simple system. You should appreciate that, being a man of order and all.""

I nodded, taking a sip of my coffee. ""It certainly is... efficient.""

Renald eyed me. ""And yet, you sound less than thrilled.""

I leaned back, watching the street beyond the shop's window. Imagining what it would be like to have such towering insectoid creatures milling about town, treated like any other citizen. Something about that felt *wrong*.

""They are useful,"" I admitted. ""More than useful. Their minds for numbers and logistics have done wonders for trade, yet...""

Renald raised a brow. ""You're worried about over-reliance.""

I smirked. ""You always did know how to get straight to the point.""

He shrugged. ""It's a fair concern. They have coexisted peacefully in Val Salia for generations, some would say they're a miracle for progress. But even then, others might say it's only a matter of time before...-""

He hesitated.

I glanced at him. ""Before what?""

But before he could answer, the entire street outside erupted into confused murmurs.

A voice-... a shrill, high-pitched echoed between the buildings.

""By royal decree, those two tribes shall share zhe land! One will farm, one will trade, aaand maybe zhey kiss about it later! No? Okay, just an idea!""

I nearly choked on my drink.

There, strutting down the street, was *her*.

Skritch.

""Zhis hereby resolves all house disputes. Be proud, citizens! You now live in zhe golden era of Yinglet Queen Skritch!""

My royal guard trailed behind her, barely avoiding that ridiculous and absolutely filthy dress that has dragged its way all along the road, with an expression caught somewhere between resignation and disbelief. The cityfolk parted as the small, furry creature declared her triumph, looking equally amused and baffled.

And then, to my horror, her muzzle lifted up ninety degrees, as she turned her head toward the coffee shop and looked *right at me*, before waving at me with a loose sleeve.

""Oh hey! See you later back at zhe castle!"" The words rang out, clear and cheerful.

For a moment, I was frozen. And the guard beside her stiffened in realization as well. The crowd turned, confused, eyes flickering between me and the strange creature.

For one dreadful second, I considered bolting right then and there. But that would be undignified... no, I had to remain composed. But... how in the hell?

She saw me. Through the disguise, *in the middle of the crowd*. Through every careful detail.

It wasn't possible.

I ignored the stares as I shakily continue sipping my coffee. Renald, beside me blinked. ""...You know him?""

I opened my mouth. Then closed it... wait a second.

""...Him?... That yinglet's a guy?"" I asked, with an absolutely mindboggled expression on my disguised face.

Before giving an answer, he leaned forward, squinting after the retreating figure and nodded.

""Yep. That's a guy alright, no fluffy bit at the end of his tail... er... you didn't know that?""

I stared at him.

He looked back at me.

Slowly, the realization sank in.

I buried my face in my hands.

It can come across as boring, stiff, and insincere.

To make ChatGPT write in a more human-like manner, you can either prompt it to write naturally or instruct it to mimic your writing style.

In this post, I will explain how you can prompt ChatGPT to write in a natural and simple way, and why this is a valuable skill.

Keeping the default style of ChatGPT often results in complicated sentences filled with buzzwords that don't sound authentic.

Your writing should be direct, easy to read, and natural. It should reflect how you would speak in real life.

To achieve this, you can use the Power Writing prompt, which can be applied to any request.

For your next prompts, simply paste the Power Writing Prompt along with your request.


""Use clear, direct language and avoid complex terminology. Aim for a Flesch reading score of 80 or higher. Use the active voice. Avoid adverbs. Avoid buzzwords and instead use plain English. Use jargon where relevant.
Avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence""


By using this prompt, the content generated by ChatGPT will transform from wordy and hard to read into something crystal clear and natural.

1iq6igy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseGently/comments/1iq6igy/the_great_employment_hoax/,The Great Employment Hoax,"TLDR: The government is secretly colluding with corporate overlords to replace all human workers with robots and AI, thereby controlling the population through a lack of employment and financial enslavement.

You think you're just living a mundane life, working a 9-to-5 job and paying taxes, but the truth is, you're just a pawn in a grand game of corporate manipulation. Here's the real scoop:

* They're stealing our jobs. That's right, they're outsourcing them to sweatshops overseas where workers are forced to toil for pennies on the dollar.
* They're using AI to replace us altogether. Just walk into any fast food joint and see the robot taking your order. It's coming for us all.
* Corporate mergers? Just a fancy way of saying ""mass layoffs"". They're taking our jobs and replacing us with soulless machines.
* And don't even get me started on customer service. We're just pawns to be used and discarded when we're no longer needed. And you know why? Because customers have become complacent and don't complain enough. They're too busy watching Netflix and eating Cheetos to care about the fact that their experience is being dumbed down and automated.
* And if you do speak out, they'll just penalize you. Remember that time you tried to stand up for yourself and got fired? Yeah, that's what I thought. They're watching us, waiting for us to slip up so they can take away our paychecks.
* It's all a giant conspiracy, folks. Wake up and smell the coffee. The truth is out there, but you have to be willing to see it.

1iq6i1q,https://i.redd.it/gi8mxbf59cje1.jpeg,2025 PS2 - All features stopped working,"Has anyone experienced this before? I was out for a short coffee run this morning and on the way home the dash suddenly started giving me error messages saying that the following features were temporarily unavailable or simply failed: 

Parking brake, one pedal drive, TPS sensors, ABS. 

I was able to make it home, despite these errors as well as the power steering no longer functioning and the car still trying to lurch forward even when pressing the brake pedal (had to put it in neutral at intersections). 

Annoyingly, Polestar support is closed on the weekends in my region and I’m unable to get through to the service centre to book an appointment. 

Has anyone experienced this before? Any effective short term workarounds to try while I wait to get a service appointment on the books?",7,1739640763.0,Polestar,6,0.89,False

1iq6g9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLFmeetups/comments/1iq6g9h/32m_sd_seeking_sb_in_chicago/,32M SD Seeking SB in Chicago,"Before I get your hopes up, I want to explain that I’m not looking for the typical SB/SD dynamic. I’m looking to build an authentic relationship with someone who is in Chicago. Someone who wants to have coffee dates, drinks, try new food, or even warm each other up with cuddles. Someone to confide in, give encouragement to, and share stories with. I’m not looking for a sexual relationship. I have no interest in finding meaningless hook ups.

I’d like to meet someone and have a relationship that surpasses financial support. I want to take care of someone while knowing that they’re also taking care of themselves. I want us to have authentic mutual attraction, vulnerability, and communication. I don’t want you to feel like you have to perform or be anyone you’re not.

My ideal dynamic would be with someone who has other relationships outside of ours. If you have another SD or a typical relationship, that’s totally fine with me. I’m not looking to fully financially support someone, but I’d love to be a person you can spend time with and always be taken care of. Name your ideal day with me, and it’s on me. Tell me what you want, and I’ll do my best to make it a reality. I want to value your time and attention, and ensure that you can try new things without worry. Even if we only see each other 1-2 times per month, I want those to feel special, safe, and comforting for us.

About me: I’m 6’0 tall, fit, and I take great care of myself. I have somewhat high standards for my own fashion, self care, and artistic expression. I’m a writer, and I’ve made my money through business consulting. I’m also a father, and I dedicate my whole heart to that. In my free time, I hangout with friends, go to concerts and local events, and try to create new memories. I’m a deeply vulnerable person who loves to share kindness and warmth with those around me. My life has been hard, and I’m grateful to be where I am today.

I’m looking to meet anyone who is interested in what I’ve described above. I won’t say what kind of women I’m attracted to because I’m not looking to objectify you. I basically want to create a close friendship with someone who I can support, and truly make our time worth their while. I’d like to cheer you on as you pursue your dreams, and I won’t be hurt if you need to stop seeing each other. Life is too short, and I’m missing this kind of connection.

I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history,  particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot but i am

**What I’m Looking For:**  
A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

**The Vibe:**  
Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.

Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.

**^(\[Subject: Skritch, Unemployed Yinglet\])**

I cleared my throat and practiced my speech again.

""Greetings, noble humans. I am here to... uh... fix your problems."" I winced at zine own reflection, adjusting zhe way my ears flopped before continuing. ""...Because I am zhe smartest know it all. And..."" I trailed off, scratching my head. Ugh. I sounded like a dumb-dumb. And didn't sound like me.

*Maybe* I didn’t need a speech. I could just... I could just wing it. That usually works!

Well... except for zhat one time with zhe bees. But no...  zhis was different. *Zhis*, was important.

I closed my eyes, sucked in a deep breazh and opened them again. And saw zhe yinglet before me straightening zheir dress, puffing out (her?) chest wizh all (his) regal importance. ""Okay."" He stated ""You handsome, handsome... guy."" I blushed at zhe words, and he swished a tail to his face as he saw my embarrassment.

And zhen, zhat sexy yinglet winked at me. ""O-oh...!"" Zhe yinglet flinched as he began fiddling with his hands as he almost knew what I was going to say. ""S-sorry but..."" And before he could try to seduce me further, I turned around and let out my truest proclamation. ""...I'm already TAKEN!""

Phew, I had \*almost\* forgot what I was doing, remember what zhe king told you?- Me?

""Solve zhis dispute, and I'll marry you on zhe spot. Also, come back anytime you like. Bye-bye!"" I retraced zhe fond, trustworzhy memory, and zhat alone would be enough to keep me focused. I *will* succeed.

Stepping forward, I zhrew open zhe door and strode outside wizh all the confidence of a queen who had already won.

Waiting just outside, my royal metal-clad assistant, Roy, leaned against zhe wall, arms crossed. I nodded up at him, expecting a salute or something, but he just raised a brow and slowly nodded back at me. Close enough I suppose.

""Is zhe *Clam Bag* ready?"" I asked in ze low, conspiratorial tone, my eyes narrowing wizh zhe weight of *royal* auzhority.

Roy smirked. Wizh a casual motion, he reached to his side and pulled forward a razher large, *hefty* sack. Bulging at zhe seams wizh what smelled unmistakably like... **Ze Zee**...

Zhe scent alone made my whiskers twitch. Powerful. Pungent... *Mouthwatering*.

""Zhen, we are ready..."" I declared, straightening my spine. Zhe sexy yinglet in zhe waiting room had to wait, for zhe greatest moment was upon us, and zhe air crackled wizh anticipation.

I took a deep breath, feeling zhe energy rise wizhin me, I pointed out to zhe road ahead and let out my most ultimate battle cry!

**""GOOO! TO ZHE VICTORY!""**

Wizh Roy at my side and zhe almighty *Clam Bag* in our arsenal, we were **unstoppable**. Zhe nobles and zheir petty, territorial squabbles wouldn’t stand a chance against our ultimate weapon... of *clams*.

**^(\[Subject: Smith, Lord of the House of Greaves\])**

I took a slow, deliberate sip of my *Kakreen Coffee*, savoring its rich, earthy bitterness. A superior drink, grown in the volcanic highlands of Kakreen, nurtured by soil far too good for those who didn’t understand refinement. Much like my House. Cultivated by generations of discipline, wealth, and wisdom, standing in stark contrast to *them*.

Through the tall window of my estate, I observed the ongoing dispute below. My grip on the porcelain cup tightened involuntarily as my gaze settled on *those damn Mirelles*. I never understood how people so tactless, so utterly devoid of vision, managed to amass anything of value. And yet, they had the audacity to claim ownership over land they *never* truly possessed. It was written in our jurisdiction, codified in the very laws they pretended to respect. But, of course, logic eluded them.

They stood there, posturing, gesticulating wildly as my men. Diplomatic, patient, *civilized*; attempted to make them see reason. I watched their unsightly faces twist with emotion, features marred by the kind of exaggerated expressions that betrayed a lack of noble upbringing. *Undignified. Tiresome.* Every second wasted on their whining was a second stolen from *real progress*.

I took another measured sip, exhaling through my nose. *What a waste of life.*

From the chair across the room, sat my ever-watchful bodyguard, a shaven man with some real nasty scars on his neck. he remained as composed as ever. Arms crossed. Silent as always. I had little need to worry about assassins with him around, though I wouldn’t put it past the Mirelles to try something. Their House had never been above underhanded tactics.

""Can you believe it, Saarad?"" My voice carried through the dimly lit room, flickering candlelight casting long shadows along the polished wooden floor.

""We're all out here bickering when the land is obviously ours. Why don't they see that?""

My foot tapped against the floorboards in irritation. I already knew the answer, of course. *Greed. Stubbornness.* That insufferable, self-righteous belief that they *deserved* what they never worked for.

""They're all just so... arrogant!"" I exhaled sharply, fingers rubbing my temple.

""Admitting one's wrongs is one of the hardest things a man can do,""\* Saarad remarked, voice steady as ever.

I let out a dry chuckle. *Exactly.* A simple truth, yet one the Mirelles would never grasp.

*""Exactly! And they won’t even make the least bit of effort to see what we have to say, at all!""* My frustration boiled over, and before I fully registered the motion, my hand jerked mid-gesture. Sending half of the remaining cup of *Kakreen Coffee* flying across the room.

The dark liquid arced through the air before landing squarely on Saarad's tabard.

I froze. Blinked.

He blinked back.

A long, pregnant silence.

*""Oh. Er... got too excited.""* I muttered, regaining my composure, reaching for a rag on the windowsill and lazily tossing it in his direction. He caught it without a word. Reliable, as always.

I sighed, rubbing my temple again. *Damn it.* Now I had no coffee. This entire situation was turning into a headache.

""Apologies, I'm just really tired right now..."" I breathed out, sincere in my apology at least, but I really do need the rest of my coffee for this looong day ahead of me."" ...Could you bring me another cup? No sugar please.""

Saarad nodded, plucked the empty cup from my outstretched hand, and made his way out. The sound of his footsteps echoed down the hallway, before fading into silence.

I exhaled, rolling my shoulders. *This entire dispute is beneath me. Beneath us.* If only they would accept the inevitable, we could return to *real* business.

Leaning against the window frame, I let my gaze drift back to the two arguing families. Still bickering. Still wasting everyone’s time.

And then-...

My brow furrowed.

A... *yinglet*?

A *yinglet* in some strange, ill-fitting dress. And a royal guard of Mel Dagon's kingdom next to it, standing before the both families.

A *yinglet* that held a clam to its ear.

And *speaking* about...-

I blinked.

Wait.

W-what the hell is going on?!

**^(\[Subject: Lady Raphael, Noble of House Mirelle\])**

""You Greaves boys just don’t get it, do you? We’ve been running in circles all morning-""

""That's enough!"" Jephrey cut in, predictably unable to let me finish a thought when it started making too much sense to him. ""*You've* been at this all WEEK. And we're sick of hearing otherwise. The land is *ours.* We showed you the proof, and you still REFUSE to accept it! Maybe you should see a doctor, get your eyes checked for color blindness.""

Before I could get the appropriate time to talk back, he pulled out that tired old map again and aggressively pointing at the *red* of our current location, like we didn't understand that the first time. ""The RED on the map? It means it belongs to us!"".

""Yeah! That's right!"" One of his loud buddies jump in to reinforce their point, but it does not provide much to the conversation.

I sighed, raising a hand to silence him. ""And how many times have we heard *that* already, Jephrey? Just because there’s a little more red on a piece of parchment doesn’t mean it’s valid, or had ever been in use by the kingdom. That makes it null. Besides, this land belonged to a tribe of Yinglets. We purchased it from them fairly, and they agreed to the sale. So, if anything, this land is *ours.*""

Jephrey scoffed, waving a dismissive hand. ""Oh, *please.* You and I both know Yinglets don’t have property rights here. The law states that only *humans* can own land."" He pulled out that same ancient rulebook, holding it up like a holy text. ""Face it, you got scammed. If they were still here, we’d have every right to reclaim what was never theirs to begin with.""

I rolled my eyes, ready to launch into another counterargument—until I noticed Jephrey and his lot staring past me, expressions shifting from frustration to something between confusion and disbelief. I followed their gaze.

And there, standing proudly in a mishmash of extravagant, ill-fitting cloth—was a Yinglet. Accompanied by a royal guard. A sack slung over the soldier’s arm. But it was the Yinglet who stood front and center, their tiny form radiating confidence.

""FEAR NOT, LADIES AND HUMANS!"" The yinglet yelled out, before holding a raised paw in the air ""...For your QUEEN has arrived!""

The argument died on the spot.

I blinked, struggling to process two things at once. First. What in the *world* was I looking at? And second-... did that Yinglet just call *herself* a *queen?*

I glanced at the royal guard for some kind of reaction. Nothing. He stood there, impassive, as if this was perfectly normal. Does that also imply that 'ladies and humans' are two completely different species? Eh, probably has a point.

Nonetheless, to my side, I saw Jephrey looking like he was about to explode. I, on the other hand, felt a smirk tug at my lips.

This was surely gonna be a *very* interesting day.

**^(\[Subject: Skritch, Unemployed Yinglet\])**

I hummed as I took in zhe scene before me, two royal tribes stood at attention. One in red, the other in greens.

Zhe red guys, were draped in... red, each carrying ze ornamental sword in zheir scabbards, zheir sharp shoulder pads making zhem look like angry triangles. Zhe green guys, were dressed in... green! Wizh streaks of brown, zheir fancy berets adorned wizh ridiculous yet oddly impressive feazhers.

I nodded sagely. Yes. I, zhe Queen, would judge zhem fairly and justly.

Wizh bozh paws behind ze back, I strode forward as regally as I could manage, miraculously not tripping over ze fancy dress. My training had served me well, indeed. Following zhe lead, zhe familiar clang of metal at my side reminded me of my royal assistant. His role was unclear, but he had a very cool looking sword, which meant he was important.

""Rejoice! For I shall examine zhe lands and deliver a most *proper* decision for zhis silly quabble!"" I declared, as any queen should, and zhe crowd held its breazh.

I took a deep sniff of zhe air, then crouched and ran my paw zhrough zhe soil. I nodded knowingly. ""Mmm... yes. Smells like ze good dirt.""

I turned to my most trusted companion and gestured toward zhe *Clam Bag*. ""A sample, if you please.""

As I pulled zhe clam from zhe bag, zhe reaction were immediate. Zhe green ones beamed, puffing zheir cheeks, spitting excitedly in approval. Zhe reds, however, furrowed zheir brows, with faces turning so red they looked like very angry tomatoes.

But I had more pressing matters.

I held zhe clam to my ear, as I listened intently to zhe **Zee** that hummed within it. Zhe wisdom of zhe *Deep*. Zhe whispers of ancient knowledge incarnate.

""Yes, yes, I see now."" I nodded solemnly before returning it to zhe bag.

I zhen lifted my hands, shaping a square wizh my zhumbs and index fingers, surveying zhe land zhrough my makeshift frame.

Very large. Very land-y.

To *truly* measure it, however. Zhere was only one way. Zhe most precise technique known to yinglet science.

I lifted my dress, flopped onto my back, and began rolling across zhe dirt.

One roll, two roll, three roll, four roll-... uhh...

Oops, I lost count.

""Ack! Hold on!"" I sputtered, standing up again. ""I was *almost* finished wizh ze measuring!""

As I dusted myself off, ready to go on a roll again, but zhen zhe doors to zhe red estate burst open. *A new challenger has arrived*.

""ENOUGH!"" he bellowed, his finger stabbing zhe air in my direction. His voice was rude, his eyes unfocused. His *hair*\-... ah.

Zhe Villain.

No human wore ze marine buzz cut (or as I like to call it, *George Washington Hair*) and *wasn't* at least a little too full of zhemselves.

He glared at me, zhen at his own men, as if seeking somezhing he forgot. Ah, maybe he forgot his keys? Maybe I cou-

""By the gods... what exactly are you *DOING*?!"" He yelped, interrupting my zhoughts.

I met his gaze with zhe unshakable confidence of a queen.

""Zhe gods of ze land speak to me,"" I intoned. ""And zhey say...""

I deeped my voice, selling zhe illusion. ""...Jennifer, zhe silly humans are at it again...""

A dramatic pause. Zhe red leader's eyebrows twitched in a display of barely contained joy. His jaw clenched in zhe traditional human sign of deep contemplation.

I spread my arms wide. ""From what I heard, ze red guys claim zhis land by... *tradition*!"" I gestured to ze red guys, in case it weren't obvious. ""But ze green ones claim it by *trade*!"" I gestured to zhe green.

Zhe crowd held its breazh.

""But... I have discovered a *zhird* truth.""

Zhe silence was *heavy*.

""Once, zhis land belonged to the Yinglets..."" (I could feel it) ""...But before zhat, it belonged to *no one*. And before zhat? It belonged to zhe *clams*... And BEFORE ZHAT...?""

I let zhe moment stretch. Zhen, my eyes glinted wizh revelation.

""...Probably, even more *clams*.""

Gasps echoed through the courtyard. Some snickered. Some coughed in what I assumed was respect. Zhe red side seemingly shifted uneasily.

Perhaps, deep down, *zhey knew*.

""Zhe only way to claim zhis land is zhrough zhe ancient and sacred *Clam-Rights Tradition*!"" I declared, bouncing my knees up a down a little, oh, ze look of zhe humans got me all riled up! But I had to stay calm and remain as composed as a queen would.

I turned to my royal subject, my most loyal advisor. His lips quivered. Clearly, he was overcome wizh zhe sheer gravity of zhe moment.

I extended my paw and motioned toward zhe *Clam Bag*. ""It is time.""

Wizh zhe grace befitting a ceremony of zhis magnitude, he handed me zhe bag. Zhe clam gods would be pleased. I could *feel* zheir presence... or, maybe zhat was just ze dirt in my fur.

Anyway, I held zhe bag aloft, preparing to begin zhe ritual-...

...

Wait.

What is zhe *Clam Trial* about? I didn't zhink zhat far ahead...

Before I could dwell on zhat, one of zhe green-garbed humans cheered, boosting ze morale. ""Haha! An excellent solution!"" A studious one with ze abricot feather agreed, before looking at ze ozher green guys behind her ""Let's do it! For the Queen of Clams!""

Ooh. Now zhat is a fancy name.

Zhe red one wizh zhe stupid hair stepped forward, his furrowed brows so intense zhey practically vored his eyes. ""W-what?! This can't-... you... you *cannot* be serious! This is a *yinglet* spouting absolute nonsense!""

He suddenly began approaching me, arms outstretched, but before he could zhank me with a hug. My view was blocked by ze golds and blues of zhe fancy pants of my royal subject, I skittered up-close to his legs and stuck my head out to watch zhe scene.

""Ha! Can't get pas a pair of greaves, can you?!"" One of zhe green guys yelled out, and his ozher friends were like ""Ooooooh!"". And immediately, his expression suddenly dropped. His cheeks were reddening, he chewed at his teeth and his eyes were bulging out of his eyes!

""Grr... insolent little...-"" Zhe man's growl trailed off.

He zhen jabbed a finger at my royal assistant's clangy clack as he looked at him in ze eyes. ""I DEMAND an explanation! What does the royal guard of Mel Dagon have to say about all this?!""

And whizh zhat, zheir eyes all turned to my royal subject in curious awe. But, he did not waver, not zhat I could see much from below zere, he merely laid down ze bag beside me, clasped his hands behind his back, looked down at ze man wizh ze bad hairdo. And wizh ze wisdom of zhe ages, declared:

""The yinglet is a neutral party appointed by His Majesty. If he says there will be a *'Trial of Clams'*, then so it shall be.""

Zhen (only I saw it), he winked at me.

My heart skipped a beat... a true ally.

I placed a paw under my chin, deep in zhought, I still did not solve ze improv moment.

Winging it might have been a bit reckless...

...

...Oh! I know! I know!

I stepped forward and slowly opened zhe bag that my royal subject laid down, and prepared to unveil zhe rules of zhe test.

**^(\[Subject: Rasaad, Lord Greaves Bodyguard\])**

I stepped into the chamber, the weight of the coffee cup steady in my hand. Perfectly made. Strong, just bitter enough, no sweetness. Lord Greaves was particular about that.

The room was empty.

I exhaled slowly, setting the cup down without a sound. He was supposed to be here. It wasn't like him to stray from routine, not without word.

A distant commotion bled through the walls. Raised voices, the sort that came when too many nobles gathered in one place, all trying to outmatch each other in outrage. I moved toward the window, brushing aside the curtain just enough for me to see.

A crowd had formed outside. Lords, ladies, colors of red and green shifting in a sea of wealth and self-importance. And at the center of it all...

A yinglet.

I huffed through my nose, more in amusement than surprise. I'd known the moment that creature arrived in the king's court this morning that something like this would happen.

Yinglets weren't made for leading. Not for the weight of power, the pull of politics, the dangers wrapped in silk and pleasantries. They were made to sow chaos. Part of their survival.

I could respect that.

I flexed my fingers, as I smoothed my dark-red leather gloves over them... a habit. A pointless one, really. No matter.

Lord Greaves was out there.

He paid well. That was enough.

I turned toward the door, gently picking up the cup of coffee in my hands, and made my way downstairs.

**^(\[Subject: Skritch, Unemployed Yinglet\])**

My speech was *so* awesome.... Too bad I forgot it.

Anyway,  zhere's some cookers on each houses's side, and a boiling pot of water. Zhe trial of clams has been dictated (by me just now) zhat each of zhe houses must pick a clam from zhe pile. And whoever's clam opens first in a pot of boiling water is zhe rightful owner of zhe land.

""Clams have NO loyalty. Zhey serve NO king. So zhey are the fairest judges in all zhe land!"" I proclaimed, watching as zhey collectively picked out zheir clams before each house came to a group decision on which to use.

House Greaves took zhe longest, *hesistant*. Zheir chief fumed at some unspoken notion before turning his glare on me, his eyes dark with suspicion.

""I-Is no one questioning this?! AT ALL?!"" he yelled, his frustration spilling over! Or should I say... *boiling* over?

...

...Get it? Because we're boiling zhe water? And ze-

""We might as well flip a coin and be done with it!"" Zhe red triangle rudely interrupted me as I was trying to explain my joke in my own head.

""Oh, but clams work differently zhan a coin toss..."" I raised a single clawed finger before pointing to zhe sky. ""Zhe clam gods will tell us who is most deserving, after all."" Realizing the clam gods is probably not in the sky, my finger then pointed to zhe nearest visible lake. Yes, perfect.

While zhe nobles bickered, ze green dudes thoughtfully considered zheir options, truly a wise pack indeed. Zhe red ones on zhe other hand, begrudgingly deliberated, and zhe lord was feeling lazy, so he waved at his other red guys to do ze searching for him, still, zey have been taking long time, my foot started tapping to zhe rhythm of my sheer level of boredom.

I looked away for one moment, however I smelt ze scent of caffeine in ze air. He was standing just ahead. Ze red guy wizh ze bad hairdoo, drinking some kind of strong and bitter dark liquid finally decided zhat he would do it himself and picked out a clam, before placing it down wizh all zhe passive aggression of a man signing away his soul.

At last, zhe *ritual* could begin.

I picked up zhe two clams and held zhem high. ""Allow me to test zheir initial strength, to avoid possible cheating!"" With that completely hypocritical statement out of zhe way, I sunk my incisor into each shell. While I did check for tampering, I also made sure *both* would open at zhe same time after only a few seconds.

Or at least, I *hoped* (I have no idea if zhat's how it even works.)

Was I really counting on zhe clam gods to make zhis moment happen? It would be *so* embarrassing if only one opened-... especially if t was for ze red guys.

Zhen a random greenie noblewoman with ze *BIGGEST* hat beamed at me, her expression almost knowing as I had dug my incisors in ze clams. Oh-. Had she figured out what I was doing?

Stepping before zhe two identical cookers, I invited a few witnesses to oversee zhe proceedings. Zhen, with a deep breath, I dropped bozh clams into zhe boiling water at the same time.

My heart pounded as I watched. Bubbles rose from zhe House Greaves pot first, sending a flicker of za panic zhrough me.

But zhen-... relief! Both clams popped open at *almost* zhe exact same moment. One of ze clams lasted maybe a blink longer, but before anyone could question it (I forgot if ze red clam was in ze left or right cooker anyway), I gasped in exaggerated surprise.

""A tie?! UNPRECENDENTED!!!"" I yelped, almost surprising myself with ze very vocabulary word, throwing my arms wide. ""Looks like you two will have to share it!""

""...*Share* it?"" Ze hairdoo monster repeated, his voice thick wizh disdain.

""Zhe clam gods have spoken! Ze green can use ze land to grow stuff, and ze red guys can use it to sell stuff!""

I paused dramatically, zhen added, ""...Or whatever else... just quit yipping and work togezher like teamwork. Zhat way, *everyone* wins!""

I zhought his hairdoo was about to come off and reveal zhat he was wearing a wig all along, but, zhat was just him vibrating. He opened his mouth, ready to argue-... zhen stopped.

Maybe he was trying to imitate a fish? Blub blub.

He looked at me. zhen at my royal assistant, zhen back at me again, and I was already imitating him ""Blub, blub..."", immediately, he closed his mouth and furrowed his brow again. Finally, wizh a frustrated snarl, and a wave of his white cup, some of ze dark stuff spilling out, he turned on his heel.

""This isn't over!"" he growled, stomping off into his house, his tribe following in embarrassed silence.

Meanwhile, ze green guys and a few of ze red sympathizer ones praised my *great and unmatched wisdom*.

Zhe smiling green lady approached, studying me wizh an unreadable expression. ""You're serious, aren't you? This is... for both of our families?""

""Of course!"" I chirped. ""Sharing is good. Everyone knows zhat, silly!""

She laughed before turning to her people. ""You know, he's not wrong. Perhaps it's time we-... oh."" She frowned, realizing most of zhem had already left.

To seal zhe deal, I reached into my pocket and pulled out two *super* shiny clam shells. ""Here,"" I said, handing it to her. ""These are from ze homeland. Zhey're very special... like you!""

Zhe human lady stared at ze shell and slowly picked it up like it was some priceless treasure. ""Wow, I... I don't know what to say..."" She smiled. ""...But, is the second one for me too?""

""When zhe red guy feels ready for zhe change, you can give it to him.""

""O-oh, hah... I don't think that red-head will ever listen to me, but...-"" She studied zhe shells even further, her expression softening. ""I-I really don't know what to say.""

""Say... yes!"" I grinned. ""And zhen, we can all be friends!""

At zhe corner of my eye, I just noticed ze bald and muscular human in a dark red cloak, a shiny zhing on his collar, smelling of iron. I saw him leaned against ze conveniently placed pillar-... clearly, *for narrative purposes*, as it made him look-... *Wow, s-so cool*...

""...Helloooo!"" I waved. He raised his head slightly, then gave a simple wave back, as his gloved hand lowered smoothly. Zhe way he *noticed* me sent a giddy shiver zhrough me, my feet tippy-tapping in excitement.

""Ohhhh, he's soooo cool!... S-standing over zhere\~!"" I sighed dreamily. And ze green lady chuckled, before looking back at zhe shells, clutching zhem closer to her chest as she approached him.

My sensitive ears perked up, eager to eavesdrop.

""Hey, Rasaad. I think you should have this.""

Zhere was a pause. ""Thanks.""

A rustle of fabric, zhe soft sound of somezhing slipping into a pocket, wow he's fast with zhose hands!

""You're their Lord's bodyguard, aren't you? Isn't it bad for you to stay behind like this?""

A pause. Zhen, his voice, deeper and unreadable. ""Yes, you're right.""

And yet... he remained. A contradiction of logic as he was still just standing zhere.

And zhen-... *he looked at me*, in zhe *eyes*.

I *died*.

Pressing ze back of my paw to my forehead, I spun dramatically and collapsed, fainting from zhe sheer *fangirl energy*. Zhat guy? Deadly cool.

A shadow loomed over me. And I cracked open an eye, seeing my royal assistant looking down at me, eyebrow raised as he kelt down, offering a hand.

""Hey, you alright?""

Zhen, I *sprang* up! Launching forward, and *smooched* his cheek! (Zhough my big tooth did most of zhe kissing) He stumbled back, cheeks reddening, possibly from embarrassement. Or from zhe bruise. Whoops!

""Never better, now zhat *yoooou're* here! *Eeeeee heee heee!*""

Additionally, supply chain disruptions and rising production costs are further pushing up prices. These issues are making coffee more expensive for both consumers and businesses, reshaping the global coffee market.

Hi there ! So I (25 yoF) have been talking to a guy from approximately September, we basically went to the same school but started talking recently on instagram (didn't know each other so much in school). We send each other stupid memes and we talk about life. We live in different cities so we don't get to see each other but we still flirt. We had a date on November which went well (only went for a coffee, nothing more) and we saw each other again last weekend since he was in my city.
He came to my place to pick me up and drove us to a cafe, than to the movies and we ended up having diner ~ it was super fun. Eventually he drove me back to my place and when we had to say goodbye I was so scared that he would kiss me (I have had several experiences but first kisses scare me so bad!!! Am I the only one??) that I just said ""I am shy soooo can we just hug to say goodbye?"" Then I went back to my place. We had a really good time BUT we have barely talked since this moment (literally a week ago). Is it a bad sign? I believe so. Guys, what do you think?
He is shy as well but if you like a girl wouldn't you text her? And if you don't like her so much will you take her to the movies and for diner, pay for everything and drive her where she wants? I'm confused. And i can't really stop thinking about it.
I try to focus on other things but toh it's difficult.
Ps: a few weeks ago I told him I was tired of flirting without anything serious (so i guess i explained i was tired of us being in a
situationship) and he said he understands an V would talk about it when we see each other. But obviously we didn't talk about it. Since I already talked to him about it I don't really want to bring it back to the table. I guess I like him but I don't want to feel like I am running after him.

- “Please stop wasting taxpayer money on spending your time trying to overturn Amendment 3,” one read.

- “MO Attorney General Andrew Bailey should stop filing frivolous lawsuits,” said another.

- Missouri state senators have touted the new initiative, called MO DOGE, as a way to seek suggestions on how to trim government waste. Who better than the public to identify inefficiency? That’s how the thinking went.

- But more than 5,000 pages of emails obtained by The Star show that Missourians have inundated the committee — and staff — with messages supporting abortion rights. Hundreds of messages warn lawmakers against attacking Amendment 3, which voters approved in November to overturn the state’s abortion ban.

- Numerous emails also call for Missouri to give control of Kansas City’s police department to local officials, attack Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s headline-grabbing lawsuits as wasteful, and call the DOGE initiative itself a poor use of resources.

- The documents signal that Republican lawmakers have largely ignored those messages. Instead, they have publicly highlighted and focused on select issues, including many aligned with their existing priorities.

- Lawmakers have crafted a spreadsheet of 70 top submissions received through the portal that did not feature the messages in support of Amendment 3 or complaints about Kansas City police and Bailey. Some include complaints over Missouri’s handling of chronic wasting disease among deer, while others hone in on allegations of local government corruption or the requirement that vehicles have two license plates.

- The submissions also include joking, off-topic, threatening and even racist messages. The script of “Bee Movie” was sent in several times, for instance. Others offer advice to lawmakers laced with sexual profanities.

- Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, an Arnold Republican who chairs the committee, said her office is only publicly highlighting complaints considered to be “substantive.” She defended the decision to omit the scores of submissions on abortion, police and Bailey, arguing those issues were not within the committee’s scope.

- “This appears to be an attempt by the supermajority to root out programs and policies that don’t align with their values,” said House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat. “It’s an endeavor that’s being taken on not in good faith.”

- “Amendment 3 was approved by the people. Now the MO legislature is spending taxpayer dollars and wasting precious time trying to overrule the people’s will,” wrote one person, who listed their address in southeastern Cape Girardeau.

- The messages largely take issue with Republican lawmakers, who have filed a raft of legislation to reinstate some level of abortion ban after voters enshrined the right to the procedure in November. While lawmakers appear at odds over how far to go to limit access, the issue is expected to receive a significant amount of attention during this year’s legislative session.

- Other submissions to the portal call on Missouri officials to return Kansas City’s police department back to local control as the city remains the only one in Missouri without direct control of its police force. The current structure relies on a five-member board of police commissioners with four members appointed by the governor. Only one elected official, the mayor, sits on the board.

- In addition to the messages about abortion and Kansas City police, Missouri’s Republican attorney general is mentioned by name 238 times in the emails reviewed by The Star. The vast majority of those submissions accuse Bailey of wasting state resources to file frivolous lawsuits.

- Most recently, Bailey filed a lawsuit against Starbucks, alleging that the coffee company’s diversity initiatives discriminated against white applicants and employees. The lawsuit claims that, since 2020, Starbucks’ workforce “has become more female and less white.”",60,1739639882.0,Defeat_Project_2025,1,0.99,False

I grind 20grms and pour 5 times 60 grams of water each. Water temperature less than 90 Celsius (194 F) always. I go for 87 (188 F) most of the time for a Geisha of Yirgacheffe. Depending of how gently I pour water in, my timing varies between 3:00 - 3:25. 

This one is a Yirgacheffe medium-light roast. For the ones starting out, don't be shy going coarser. Your wet grounds should not look muddy at all. ",0,1739639803.0,pourover,12,0.32,False

The cardio burned 100 calories, but the apple could be 100 calories.

I would like to invite anyone to come to the diner for a coffee and maybe some delicious dessert. Not for business. Just a friendly get to know you chat. I must say the coffee at the diner is quite amazing. I have tried to ask what they do to make it so tasty but they won't give their secrets. Nor should they. I would protect such secrets like that.

I'm literally so tired and I've had enough of this. 

I've plowed through everything like a rocket and somehow I manage to survive in the end, but I'm literally so tired of doing this.

So for context, I have my A/L exam and I had a midlife crisis and decided to switch my entire career path from ICT to Medicine. I'm a hard worker, with enough effort I can manage almost anything.

My exams are in May of this year, I 100% have enough time, I have a perfect plan and timetable. I have supportive parents. My mom literally wakes up at 3am to make me coffee when I pull all nighters. I have all the material downloaded, I have a notion workspace.

But for the love of god I cannot study. I mean I can't explain it, it isn't motivation, because I 100% do want to study. And ffs I even enjoy studying. I feel so proud of myself when I make progress. I have minimized literally every distraction, I quit social media and I don't even watch Youtube.

Why tf is this so hard, like why does my damn brain just have to give up on me. FFS, I genuinely want to study, and I'm on the verge of a mental break down, because the moment I open a book my brain just friggin gives up. ISTG if my brain was a person I would be punching the shit outta it, I'm literally so mad.

Pomodoro timers, try step by step, none of those stuff work for me. 

For most people, its lack of motivation but for me I have all the motivation I need, and for the first time in my life I am actually preparing fairly early.

I mean I start reading the book and my brain literally goes blank. The only thing that's keeping me from a severe mental breakdown is because I always play songs (its a habit I can't live without). I actually have no clue what to do. Tried watching a lesson video, ended up watching a 5 minute video for 25 minutes. Read the same page for 45 minute. ",1,1739639719.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

Unlike Western romance, there’s no required HEA (although most do end happily) and romance can be a subplot. Dark themes can come up fairly often in Asian media so research content warnings if there are things you want to avoid.

* [***KinnPorsche***](https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/kinnporsche-novel/) by Daemi- dark modern organized crime. Note that the author duo is very problematic, the TLDR version of it boils down to sexual harassment of actors in the live action dramatization of the book, grooming of a minor, racism towards international fans, religious bigotry, and cyber bullying. See more info on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kinnporsche/s/YBJXWnKZoV), [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/kinnsporsche/690244424765259776/a-comprehensive-guide-on-why-daemi-is-literally), and [Twitter](https://x.com/firstkhaolvr_/status/1760527632540787004). Final volume count TBD, comes in physical, ebook, and audiobook formats

*I’ve organized all my other BL novel lists by publisher but I’ll be organizing these next sources by platform both for the sake of simplicity and because many of these books are self-published. There’s a ton of overlap with books available from multiple sources, I’ll list each book once but don’t be surprised if the same book can be found elsewhere. I’ve chosen to leave out books that only have incomplete “trial samples” available in English or that I have reason to suspect were possibly created by AI.*

[**Meb:**](https://www.mebmarket.com) Thai ebook platform, you can switch the website language to English in the bottom left corner. I downloaded the app and one of the first things it prompted was what language I wanted to use, I clicked English, and the app automatically filtered for English translations. There’s a slight price increase when buying via the iOS app vs the website and I don’t know if that applies to other operating systems, books must be read in the app. **Plot blurbs were often lacking details so I did my best to make assumptions about genre but there may be mistakes, I also wasn’t able to find much info about whether books have HEAs or not. Translation quality varies, I suggest downloading the free sample before making purchases**

I’ve always been very active (workout 5x/week) and a healthy eater. I used to eat mostly plant based but over the last couple years have started eating meat at almost all meals. I started to focus on getting more protein. I eat mostly chicken and salmon with a vegetable and jasmine rice or cauliflower rice. I started eating more red meat in the last year, during a meal once every 1-2wk (burger or steak). I snack on beef chomps and light string cheese during my 12 hour (mostly night) shifts. I eat Greek yogurt w/ blueberries for breakfast or lunches. I drink almond milk in my coffee (I drink a lot of coffee 1-3/day). I love dessert but usually try have Yasso/frozen Greek yogurt bars and sometimes regular ice cream. We cook with EVOO, but in the last year I’ve started putting butter on sourdough, I try to use small amounts. I eat chicken sausage patties from Trader Joe’s and eggs for breakfast 1-2x/week. I don’t drink often, maybe 1-2 glasses of wine 1-2x/month. Drink sparkling waters, sometimes a Diet Coke.

2022-2023 I weighed my highest at 160-170lb, after a 30-35lb weight gain, while in grad school (doing full time clinical hours) and still working full time nights. So really working >60 hours a week. I wasn’t able to workout hardly at all and not eating as well. 

Starting mid 2023, I was able to start working out 5x/week again. I currently lift 2-3x/week, Solidcore/“pilates” 1x/week, I do power walking, incline walks, some running  3-5x/week, and go ice skating 1x/week. Graduated in Spring 2024, so back to normal-ish work hours (still 12 hour shifts nights and days). I am down to 154lbs. I am 5’3, so I’d still like to lose at another 10lbs at least.

I feel very active but do I need to be doing more? Do I need to cut out all of the red meat, chomps, and cheese? Is it coffee and stress? I have a pretty high stress, mostly night shift job, been working in health care for 10 years. I have pretty high anxiety and years of managing my PTSD and depression to what feels like a very stable place. Do I need to go back to eating mostly plant based w/ exception of chicken and fish?

I’m feeling overwhelmed and don’t know where to start without feeling like I am completely changing my diet.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from India, currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

For years, Lavery, 22, had idolized Charity Kiss, a band with over four thousand monthly listeners on Spotify and a staple of Reno’s music scene.  
  
She had spent countless nights at The Holland Project, singing along in the crowd, never imagining she’d one day be capturing them through her own lens.  
Her love for photography had started in high school, in an art class at McQueen, but it wasn’t until her mother gifted her a camera at graduation that she truly dove headfirst into documenting Reno’s underground music scene.  
  
When Charity Kiss reached out, she was just getting started, still building her confidence.  
  
“I was like—there’s no way they actually want me to take their photos,” Lavery admitted.  
  
But that shoot marked just the beginning. Over time, she has become one of the most sought-after and affordable photographers in the scene, turning her passion into a career and making a name for herself.  
  
Lavery is currently showcasing her photos at Midnight Coffee Roasting, where her live show, documentary style moments are available for sale in a sleek black frame.

The drink was alright enough, a little pricey but this is supposed to be a Starbucks clone so I guess that's to be expected. But the food was just so bad. The selection was terrible, too; egg and sausage on an English muffin, sure, but that's it. No hash brown, no wraps, no bagels. I get Starbucks has fairly bad food too but they still have a wider selection and, from what I remember, it at least tasted better than the bag it came in.

After it was clear we're both really falling for eachother, I started to reconsider. Maybe...it's possible? I brought it up to her, the idea of maybe doing long distance some day in the future. She liked the idea but said she wanted to take things slow, which I am fine with, and actually agree with. I made it clear I would want to take her out on a couple of online ""dates"" (I.e. video calling over coffee, streaming a movie together, etc.) first before we actually starting anything official, obviously. 

But then she told me she wanted to get to know me better first, before going on any dates. Which kind of confuses me, because I feel like that's the whole point of a date- to get to know someone better and find out if you want to move into anything deeper with them. 

I'm at a loss for what to do... I will respect her wishes to take things slower. I'm just not sure what to do from this point moving forward.

I just sent a text to a friend of mine. She's someone I love dearly and have spent hours and days with. I know and love her family and we have a large network of mutual friends. Our lives were very integrated for a long time. And most of that time I spent with her, I was drinking heavily. 

Saturdays used to be our boozy lunch days. We'd go out and get trashed and I manage to stumble my way home and pass out, waking up miserable on Sunday morning. She still does this. I don't. 

We've had lunch and seen each other a couple times in the 55 days I've been alcohol free and I've noticed a relationship change. She's less inclined to seek me out to spend time with and definitely seems odd and awkward around me. She's still been drinking heavily during those times I've seen her and either she'll leave once she's drunk or I'll leave the situation once she's hit what I feel like is a level of drunk I don't want to deal with. 

Anyway, I was hoping to have lunch with her today. It's an easy out for me as well, to enjoy her sober and be present for her first few drinks and then excuse myself from the process of Saturday drunkenness. But her response to me didn't indicate openness to it. And that is perfectly fine. 

I don't have a question here, just an observation - oh, how times change. And with our behavior change comes all sorts of other changes, good, sad, uncomfortable, and awesome.

[*A.B’s POV*]

It’s already been a few days since the incident at the coffee shop, things were going…. well, better than she expected.

Hunter’s secret lair wasn’t exactly… secret. It was a small building in one of the more urban parts of the city. The words “Hunter Agency” inscribed all over the front, it just looked like a regular office building, minus the 10 floors though, it literally only had one floor.

The inside was pretty nice I guess, a few potted plants here and there and a couch near the entrance so that patrons could wait, not like people ever came to this place anyways, which is why she liked her new job so much more than the last one. No social interactions, and no fuss.

Of course, there was the front desk, which is where Abandoned spent most of her time. Hunter was always in the back doing… well who knows what he could be doing! Probably admiring himself some more, now that she thought about it. 

Well, who cares? The pay was pretty good and she was living a semi-honest life, that’s more than she could ever hope for. 


[*Ghost’s POV*]


*Try to smile some more!*

Her stupid voice kept playing in his head.

He didn’t know who it was from.

…


Wait, what was he doing? He can’t spend his time thinking of stupid shit like this, he needs to get out of here. FAST.

Damn it, why did he have to steal from Solace Corp. They practically own half the world! 

Well, when you have entire countries gunning for your ass, at least you know your gang’s safe.

Yea… that’s right, he left his entire gang of bandits under the care of his most trusted supervisor, “The Mortician”. They’ll be fine!

Him though? Well let’s just say he needs to get out of the country before they find him.

Where was he again? It said Haxtonia on the map, so that’s where he must be!

“I think I remember something about this city…” He thought to himself.

Oh yeah! He remembers now! It was constantly under attack during c00lkid’s era. He heard it was pretty peaceful now, should be a nice place to lay low for a while. Now if he could just find an alleyway to plan out his next move…


He weaved through the bustling crowds, stopped to get a snack or two at a nearby cafe, eventually landed himself in an alleyway between two abandoned buildings in one of the more urban parts of the city. Perfect! That is, until he bumped into someone.

[*Aster’s POV*]

Aster was living a pretty tough life, I mean, it was pretty tough being a wizard in this futuristic society. Ever since the “Great Wizard Purge” a couple years ago, things have never been the same… 

He wished his mentor was here to tell him where he went astray in life.

Heh, his mentor…

A kind man- wait no, he was a cat wizard. Damn, already forgetting stuff about him already.

Aster’s attempts to escape the “Great Wizard Purge” led him to the city of Haxtonia, he heard it was pretty calm there. Surely the Purges won’t come looking here, it was c00lkid’s territory once.

Aster isn’t very good with directions though, his attempts to go to the apartment he recently bought in downtown Haxtonia… somehow ended up with him bumping into a stranger in an urban part of the city.

Wait, those clothes… and a gun? That’s Purger attire! Did they find him? That’s not possible! He used every spell in the book to cover his tracks! Shit, he needs to get his staff and blow his ass to hell before things go south!


[*Ghost’s POV*]

Man… who the hell is this bozo.

Ghost was just minding his business in a shady alleyway until a random stranger ran into him and then started shouting something about “Purgers” and how he was so good at covering his tracks.

Wait… could this guy be a mercenary hired by Solace Corp.? They *are* known for hiring weirdos these days, wouldn’t be completely unlikely. 

If that’s the case, then Ghost needs to put a bullet in his brain before he gets a chance to use that staff of his.


[*Our POV*]

The movement was instant.

They both got a hand on their weapons at the same time.

They aimed their weapons at each-other’s heads.

Ghost’s hand was steady on the trigger, a devilish smile spread across his face. His breathing was steady, although he had fear, he didn’t let his enemy see it. No, he didn’t let himself see it.


Aster’s staff had sparks coming out of it, a soft flame produced out of it, he knew this was a bad situation. But he wouldn’t let the Purgers take something away from him ever again.

Ghost spoke up first.

Ghost: “Hey. You know you aren’t just challenging Death, right? **You are challenging the one who faced it.**”

Aster: “Is that so? **Then you shall face it again.**”

Aster displayed a smirk, albeit not a confident one. But it was just enough to make Ghost a little more nervous.

Ghost acted first, his finger pulling down on the trigger.

Aster quickly reacted, he ducked down and dodged the bullet as the flame on his staff grew, as it shot out a burst of fire at Ghost.

Ghost was sent flying, landing on the other side of the alley. He stood up, albeit with major burns, and focused in on his target.

“Gotcha.”

Aster couldn’t even see it. A bullet was now lodged in his leg.

“Shit!”

Aster used one of his spell to teleport behind Ghost.  

The adrenaline was the only thing keeping him standing.

He struck the shoulder with his staff.

Ghost fell to his knees, he aimed his gun backwards. The bullet struck Aster’s leg once more.

“Damn it!”

[*??- Sebastian’s POV*]

They had finally found him.

She sat on a throne of iron. She snapped her fingers as her assistant, Chièlia, brought her more wine on a silver platter.

The Hacker she hired, Exec, walked up to her with some news.

Exec: “Miss, we seem to have found Ghost.”

Sebastian: “Ghost? The douchebag that stole from one of my facilities?”

Exec: “Yep! That guy! Though there seems to be another person with him.”

Sebastian: “So? Who cares?! Must be one of his subordinates, *send in the drones*. **And blow those fuckers straight to hell.**”

Exec flashed a smile.

Exec: “Of course, miss.”

Exec entered a few commands on her “Funny Device”.

“This’ll be *fun*!”

[*Ghost and Aster’s POV*] 

“WHAT THE FUCK ARE THOSE!!!”

Last night I went to the Northern Soul night in EartH Hackney. Towards the burning embers of the night, right at the front of the dance floor I began dancing with a lovely Scottish girl. I didn’t manage to pick up her name but we had a great ole dance of spinning and picking each other up. Just as the dance was hitting its peak, she leaped towards me, so I could pick her up again. Having been quite inebriated I wasn’t feeling my Patrick Swayze best and we both fell over, me smacking my tailbone on the floor and her smacking her head. I went with her to the bouncers where they took her into a separate room to receive medical assistance. They told me to wait outside and not longer after that the bouncers escorted everyone out of the building as the night had come to its end. 

I didn’t manage to see her again or pick up her name but the bouncer who she went off with earlier told me she managed to find her friend so hopefully she got home safe. 

If you’re reading this, you seemed so lovely and I truly enjoyed our dance. I felt like this was a great start to a valentines story that hadn’t quite concluded.

over steeped tea    
sitting on the counter    
forgotten.  

Or the darkest chocolate    
that coats your mouth.    
You can almost drown in it. 

 Cheap gas station coffee    
that burns your tongue    
going down,    
scorching your throat,   
you keep drinking it anyway 

Her love feels like    
a winter wind    
that bites your cheeks    
stings your eyes    
as tears form.

A day at the beach  
in July    
when the ocean is still    
forty some degrees.    
Salty sunscreen fills your mouth,    
sand sticks to your greasy skin. 

A hot summer day    
when the heat    
is so unbearable    
that you can feel    
your skin cooking    
tightening as you roast  

Her love sounds like    
A pack of dogs barking in    
the middle of the night    
your head buried under pillows.

Sirens blasting by your window    
pulling you out of your dream    
not letting you fall back asleep.

The whispering of a thousand voices    
all around you    
panicked and mixing    
as your skin crawls.

Her love smells like    
A runover skunk    
whose insides are marinating    
spread across the road.

The one person who overuses cologne,    
walking by him makes your    
nostrils burn. 

Rancid liquid that sits in the bottom    
of fast-food trashcans.    
You have to    
fight the urge not to puke. 

Her love looks like    
Gas money    
for a car that you have to drive    
in order to serve her.

Your favorite foods    
cooked for when you come home,    
so maybe you won’t leave her too.

Taking your dog to the vet after    
pestering and pestering    
until she finally gives in.

But her love is silent because you’re    
can’t talk to her    
because she’ll blame herself.  

But you love her anyway    
because that’s what you’re supposed to do.

Besides suffering in silence is in style    
isn’t it?

1iq5mon,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1iq5mon/tipping_system_like_kofi_or_buy_me_a_coffee_but/,Tipping system like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee but with crypto ?,"Hi

I'm looking for a way to accept small tips and donations from users in my community  
I will probably make a Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee account, but those services only accept fiat money via stripe, cashapp, paypal... and I know some people don't like to use those and would prefer sending a tip in crypto (well known crypto that are easy to deal with and widely accepted, so bitcoin ethereum and monero)

So I've looked online for a tipping platform like those 2 but with crypto, but I can't find anything useful, not even a reddit post talking about the idea, which I find really weird

The ONLY thing I've found is this website called ""cwallet"", but it seem fishy as hell, the website itself look like something big and professional, but except the website itself, there is absolutely no info about it online, no one talking about it on reddit or any other forums

So I'm asking all of you here, is there such a thing as a platform where you can receive tips in crypto that redirect them to your wallet ?

Please it have to be something SIMPLE like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee

I know I could simply give my wallet address directly or a QR code and tell people to donate there, BUT I want to offer small compensation for the tips like special roles and customisation on discord, so I need the person tipping to be able to send a small message with their username with the tip

I also know that ultimately I could make a webage with a crypto paiement tool, something where you select the amount you want to give, it generate a QR code for the right amount to my wallet, it allow people to enter a small message that I would receive by mail or something, and the system check the blockchain to see if the paiement is real and once it's confirmed it send the mail with the confirmation + the user's message...  
But this is faaaar beyond what I can do...

Things to AVOID:

* Avoid any tour with more than 4-5 people. Going by yourself is massively preferable to going on a large tour, and small private tours are priced similarly to large group tours. The tour companies just take the difference. All around La Fortuna you will see tour buses packed with 10-20 people get out and follow a lethargic guide through an event. Everyone looked miserable.
   * At Mistico, this was particularly a problem. We constantly passed massive groups moving at a snail's pace, and the people were vocally upset: ""We haven't heard a single thing the guide said the whole time""
   * There were a few times where the guides would send people somewhere to get out of there hair, I'd tell the guide ""Hey, we just saw a Toucan/Snake over there you should check it out with your group"", and they'd look miserable. The large tour group guides clearly find managing these groups tedious and neither they nor the tour go-ers seem to have fun.
   * If you are on a large tour with one guide, they cannot let 5, 10, 20 people all look through their telescope.
* Avoid Mistico after 8am. The large tour buses full of these massive groups all arrive around 7:50 and enter right at 8-8:10. Once you are stuck behind them, you are basically in a line at Disney to go over these bridges. It took us 20-ish minutes to get past all of the tours clogging the trails, and after that we had a blast.
* Avoid ziplining, do canyoning if you can, but only if you can be sure to be in a small group.
   * We did ziplining and canyoning tours with maquique adventure. The canyoning was epic, the ziplining was of course cool but more disney-esque. If you want a unique experience or a thrill, do canyoning. I actually felt safer rappelling down a 200m waterfall than i did on the ziplines.
   * The tour guides were awesome, but our group was relatively small. In peak season, the whole canyoning and ziplining paths will be packed with people and you will be waiting and it will take a lot of fun out of it. We had a small group, with 3 people per 1 guide, and we still were waiting a non-insignificant amount of time between each rappel / zip line.
* Avoid the coffee / chocolate tours.
   * We did a tour with Northfields that was highly recommended on Reddit, but in my opinion it was very lame. Our tour guide was awesome, but the tour is 3 hours when it could and should be 45 minutes max. The chocolate and coffee were good, but the whole situation of being packed in with 15 other people and getting shuffled like cattle from one station to the next felt very cheap. I would not do this again.
   * If there was a 30-45 minute coffee / chocolate tour, where they let you taste different coffees and chocolates and compared and contrasted them, let you taste the raw cocoa beans, that would be far preferable to the 3 hour experience.

Things that are ""mid"":

* Hot springs
   * We went to Baldi Hot Springs and it was ok. It's weird to go to hot springs when it's 80 degrees outside. Drinks were insanely expensive - $20 minimum. We were just looking for somewhere to relax after a long day, and we did relax here, but I wouldn't come back to hot springs. If I were to do it again, I'd do a dip for 20-30 and head out.
      * Pros: Water was incredibly clean, they empty out the pools every night, so all of the water is fresh
      * Cons: Artificial pools (they don't look natural), insanely expensive drinks
* Don Ruffino's ""tasting menu""
   * We were recommended this place as it is the only fine dining in La Fortuna, and it was good, but it wasn't that great. $315 USD for a 5 course tasting menu, but the dishes were pretty basic. We live in Greenville SC (small city in the US) and have 3 dinner spots that do 3-5 courses and all are *vastly* superior and the total ticket with 20% tip is normally around $250.
   * The service was excellent, but this isn't anything special or a really special experience. We would have been better suited just eating off their regular menu or going somewhere else.
* Spectacular Tacos
   * These were super mid. Their birria tacos especially were ""ok"". Considering this place has 548 5-star reviews the food was not that great. Quick service though.
* Most of the food in La Fortuna in general is ok to pretty good. You will see 500-1000 5-star reviews at every restaurant, but nothing is really special. The only reason I call out Spectacular is because i saw so many reviews on them on Reddit. Just don't go somewhere that screams tourist trap and you'll get decent food.

Things to run toward:

* Canyoning, as I mentioned above, with the caveats above.
* Private nature tours. We did a private nature/sloth tour with a local tour guide named Richard that we found on Reddit (https://www.instagram.com/birding\_fortuna/). Richard was awesome, he truly cared about the animals and teaching us about them. The cost came in just about equivalent to ""Sloth Territory"", which would have been a 10+ person group as far as we were told.
   * Basically, there is no reason to do a group tour when the cost for a local guide is the same for a 2 person as a 20 person tour put on by a company.
   * If Richard is booked, you can probably find someone similar on instagram or reddit.
* Rent a car. It became clear the first day how much less fun it would have been if we had been on one of those large vans. You will want to cancel and reschedule things so you can take a nap after a long event, you will want to pick your lunch spot, you need flexibility.
* Birria tacos at Arenal Bongos (https://maps.app.goo.gl/8pu9Z1TmaDaioaFz7)
   * Their pizza was **god awful**, but their birria tacos were insanely good. We lived in Texas for a few years a while back, and I haven't had birria tacos even close to as good in years. Bongos were better. I will say, they were totally empty when we got there so they may have had to cook them fresh for us...
* La Fortuna Waterfall
   * Yes, there are a lot of people, but not as many as you'd think. Many of the tour bus type people can't make it down / up the stairs, and even those who made it down, very few people could swim in the choppy water where the waterfall is. The water is beautiful, there are some small rocks you can jump off of, and once youre in the water it's gorgeous.
   * If you have kids, there is a much more crowded area by the river you can go to where you can hang out.
   * \*\*If they are not letting guests swim in the waterfall, I would not go\*\*
   * It took us 6 minutes to get down and 7 minutes to get back up. Unless you have a disability it will not take the advertised 30 minutes down / 45 up, that is insane.
* Sloffee Coffee
   * Nothing special about this place, but they put out plantains for the birds every morning at 9am and we saw some toucans 5m away. They stayed for 20 minutes, it was pretty cool.

In summary, we LOVED our trip (despite my comments on the avoid/mid), and when we come back next year same time, we will be hiring our same tour guide and going to Monteverde, which in my understanding has more of the things we loved about LF (nature) and a bit less of what we want to get away from (tourist-traps).

I also want to add that while I kind of crap on LF for being touristy, it is super easy to avoid (if you basically completely ignore google reviews and any group tours) and there are way more touristy places we've been and this doesn't even get close to the top of the list, given you are hours away from cruise ports.",5,1739638292.0,CostaRicaTravel,8,0.86,False

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the way businesses operate, and its impact on customer relationship management is undeniable. A recent study found that companies excelling in customer experience (CX) grow revenues 4%-8% above their market^(1)In today's competitive business landscape, leveraging cutting-edge technology is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the way businesses operate, and its impact on customer relationship management is undeniable. A recent study found that companies excelling in customer experience (CX) grow revenues 4%-8% above their market^(1). AI empowers businesses to attract and retain high-paying clients more effectively than ever before, driving revenue growth and fostering long-term loyalty. This blog post outlines five proven strategies to harness the power of AI for optimizing client relationships and achieving sustainable success.



# 1. Hyper-Personalization: Tailor the Experience

Customers today expect personalized experiences. In fact, 71% of consumers expect companies to deliver personalized interactions, and 76% get frustrated when this doesn't happen, especially when they expect it^(2). AI enables businesses to analyze vast amounts of customer data, including demographics, past purchases, browsing history, and online behavior, to create granular customer profiles and deliver hyper-personalized experiences^(2). This not only enhances the customer experience but also improves brand loyalty^(2).

To effectively personalize the customer journey, it's essential to map it out. A customer journey map visually depicts the stages customers go through from initial awareness to becoming loyal advocates^(3). By identifying potential pain points and areas for improvement at each stage, businesses can proactively enhance the overall experience and foster stronger relationships.

Here's how AI can facilitate hyper-personalization:

* **Personalized Content:** AI can generate targeted content, such as product recommendations, blog posts, or social media updates, that resonate with individual customer preferences. For example, AI can help a clothing retailer recommend specific outfits based on a customer's past purchases, style preferences, and even the current weather.
* **Tailored Offers:** AI can identify the most relevant offers and promotions for each customer, increasing the likelihood of conversion. Imagine receiving a discount on your favorite coffee blend just as you're about to run out – that's the power of AI-driven personalization.
* **Customized Communication:** AI can personalize communication across all channels, including email, chat, and social media, ensuring that every interaction is relevant and engaging. This could involve addressing customers by name, recommending products based on their browsing history, or offering support in their preferred language.



# 2. AI-Powered Chatbots: Provide Instant Support and ""Aha!"" Moments

Customers value quick and efficient support. AI-powered chatbots can provide 24/7 availability, answering common questions, resolving simple issues, and escalating complex queries to human agents when necessary^(4). This ensures that customers receive immediate assistance, regardless of the time of day or day of the week.

AI chatbots can also be integrated with knowledge bases to provide accurate and up-to-date information to customers^(4). This reduces the workload on human agents and allows them to focus on more complex issues.

Furthermore, AI chatbots can be used to gather valuable customer feedback and insights. By analyzing chat logs, businesses can identify common customer pain points and areas for improvement in their products or services.

But AI chatbots can do more than just provide support; they can also be instrumental in delivering those crucial ""Aha!"" moments to customers. An ""Aha!"" moment is that flash of insight where a customer suddenly realizes the true value of a product or service^(3). By guiding customers through interactive tutorials, providing personalized recommendations, and offering proactive assistance, AI chatbots can help customers quickly experience the benefits of your offerings and become loyal users.



# 3. Predictive Analytics: Anticipate Customer Needs and Offer Connected Upsells

AI-driven predictive analytics can analyze customer data to identify patterns and predict future behavior. This allows businesses to anticipate customer needs and proactively address potential issues before they arise^(5). This proactive approach is a key advantage of AI-driven retention strategies, as traditional methods often focus on reactive measures after a customer has already expressed dissatisfaction^(6).

For example, AI can predict which customers are most likely to churn based on their engagement patterns and past interactions. This allows businesses to take proactive steps to retain these customers, such as offering personalized incentives or reaching out to understand their concerns. By knowing not just who might leave but also why they might leave, businesses can leverage AI to design highly targeted and personalized retention actions, significantly improving the likelihood of success^(6).

Predictive analytics can also be used to identify potential sales opportunities, including connected upsells. Connected upsells are add-on products or services that are relevant to what customers are already using^(3). By analyzing customer data, AI can identify which customers are most likely to be interested in specific products or services, allowing businesses to target their marketing efforts more effectively and increase revenue from existing clients.

Consider the case of Netflix, which uses AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze user viewing habits and preferences to provide personalized content recommendations^(7). This AI-driven approach has resulted in higher user retention and increased viewing time, with the personalized recommendation engine accounting for 80% of the content watched on Netflix.



# 4. AI-Driven Customer Segmentation: Target the Right Audience and Contextualize Your Offering

AI can segment customers into distinct groups based on their demographics, behaviors, and preferences^(8). This allows businesses to tailor their marketing messages and offers to specific customer segments, increasing the effectiveness of their campaigns.

For example, a luxury car manufacturer can use AI to identify high-net-worth individuals who are likely to be interested in their latest model. This allows them to create targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with this specific audience, maximizing their return on investment.

However, effective customer segmentation goes beyond just identifying groups; it also involves contextualizing your offering^(3). Clearly defining your target audience and articulating your value proposition in a way that resonates with them is crucial for attracting the right clients. This means understanding their needs, pain points, and motivations, and positioning your product or service as the ideal solution.



# 5. Enhance Customer Service with AI Assistants

AI can empower customer service teams by providing them with the tools and information they need to deliver exceptional support. AI assistants can:

* **Draft Responses:** AI can analyze customer inquiries and draft appropriate responses, saving agents time and ensuring consistency^(4).
* **Provide Context:** AI can provide agents with a complete overview of a customer's past interactions, allowing them to personalize their service and resolve issues more efficiently^(4).
* **Analyze Sentiment:** AI can analyze customer sentiment in real-time, allowing agents to identify and address potential issues before they escalate^(5).

By enhancing the capabilities of customer service teams, AI helps businesses build stronger relationships with their clients and foster loyalty.



# AI Tools and Technologies

Several AI-powered tools and technologies can be used to implement the strategies discussed above. Here are a few examples:

* **Zendesk AI:** This tool can automate routine tasks like ticket routing, categorization, and response suggestions, freeing up agents to focus on more complex issues. It can also be used to create AI-powered chatbots for 24/7 support^(9).
* **Freshdesk:** This platform offers AI-powered automation, self-service features, and actionable analytics to enhance customer support operations^(9).
* **HubSpot:** This CRM platform includes AI-powered tools for marketing automation, sales pipeline management, and customer service^(9).
* **Userlytics:** This user experience testing platform uses AI to analyze video recordings of user sessions and identify areas for improvement^(9).
* **Hotjar:** This website analytics tool provides heatmaps, session recordings, and user feedback tools to understand customer behavior on your website^(9).
* **Qualaroo:** This customer feedback platform uses AI-powered analytics to analyze user feedback and identify key insights^(9).

To effectively leverage these tools, businesses need to collect and clean data for AI applications. This data can be sourced from various places, including:

* **Past data:** Existing data collected by your products or services can be organized and cleaned for AI use^(10).
* **Manual data collection:** Data labelers can be hired to manually label datasets, although this can be costly and time-consuming^(10).
* **Automated data collection:** Automated tools and scripts can be used to scrape data from websites and other sources^(10).
* **Purchased datasets:** Third-party data providers offer pre-built datasets, which may require cleaning and validation^(10).
* **Generative models:** AI algorithms can be used to generate synthetic data to augment existing datasets^(10).

It's crucial to ensure that data is collected and used responsibly, in compliance with relevant data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines.



# Value and Partnerships

While AI can significantly enhance customer relationships, it's important to remember that technology alone is not enough. Offering exceptional value to your clients is paramount^(11). This means delivering high-quality products or services that meet their needs and exceed their expectations. It also involves providing outstanding customer service, building trust, and fostering long-term relationships.

Building strategic partnerships can also play a crucial role in attracting and retaining high-paying clients^(11). Collaborating with other businesses and professionals in related industries can expand your reach, enhance your credibility, and provide access to new markets.



# Conclusion

AI is revolutionizing the way businesses interact with their clients. By implementing the five strategies outlined in this blog post – hyper-personalization, AI-powered chatbots, predictive analytics, AI-driven customer segmentation, and enhanced customer service with AI assistants – businesses can leverage AI to build stronger customer relationships, increase loyalty, and drive revenue growth.

However, it's essential to approach AI implementation strategically and ethically. This includes prioritizing data privacy, mitigating bias in AI systems, and being transparent with customers about how AI is being used. By embracing AI responsibly and combining it with a commitment to exceptional value and strategic partnerships, businesses can unlock new levels of customer engagement and achieve sustainable success in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

Start implementing these strategies today and witness the transformative power of AI in your business!

I got a cold brew maker, which is a more fancy way to say a glass jar with a filter bag in it. This probably works just as well with hot coffee.

One of my favorite drinks is the shaken brown sugar oatmilk espresso. Who has 7$ for that on a regular basis? 

I'm lucky that I have a winco in my area, they have a coffee grinder in the store. What you're gonna do is get the darkest coffee they have, and grind it on their finest setting, like, Turkish or espresso. 

If that's not an option, most places have espresso ground coffee even the cheap kind will do. The reason is that when you make the cold brew in a huge jar (Mine is I think 2 gallons), you need more concentrated coffee to make up for the amount of liquid. (If you use this in your regular coffee maker it'll taste gross unless you're into that more power to you). 

You're gonna let that sit in the fridge over night and you should have fantastic strong cold brew in the morning. You can easily cut it with water if it's too strong for your tastes. 

Then you're going to take the jar of molasses you also got while you were at the store, in the bakery isle, and you're going to drizzle in just a small amount (I used about half a spoonful to a decent size glass maybe 20oz). 

Then add what ever milk or cream you like (I like unsweetened oatmilk). 

If you want more sugar that's fine, I add a little extra Splenda, the molasses is just for the taste. 

It tastes like a molasses cookie. It tastes like a lovly Amish lady handed you a cold brew at the lake. It tastes like the summer when you were little and playing outside. It tastes like that Christmas where it snowed a lot, and you got to see it pile up out side by the window. 

Maybe you hate molasses and brown sugar, don't make this if you don't like that. Otherwise, it's genuinely the best decision I've made regaurding my coffee in a long time.

Now, I had a day where I ran out of meds and it was awful. Total chaos. And headaches that were really bad. The nurse said that it’s likely I am dependent and having withdrawal when I run out. 

She said that 20% of people adjust to the meds and they effectively stop working?

She also said she thinks I should be taking regular breaks / holidays to keep them working. However, if I skip a day I feel rubbish??

So my options seems to be…
Just keep taking them forever cause they work?
Start trialing longer “holidays”??
Stop??

There was nothing in the world Alexander Grayson couldn’t buy.

He owned cities. He owned industries. He owned people.

But he didn’t own **time.**

And that terrified him.

He was the **richest man in human history**—his empire stretched across continents, his name was printed in every major publication, his face was recognizable from the slums of Mumbai to the penthouses of Manhattan.

And yet, as he sat in his silent, private penthouse, surrounded by artifacts of **forgotten rulers**, his hands trembled.

Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Tesla, the emperors of lost civilizations—**great men**, once worshiped, now nothing more than names in dusty books.

He pressed his hands against his face, feeling the warmth of his skin.

**One day, no one will remember me.**

**One day, I will be gone.**

The thought made his stomach twist. **All his power, all his wealth, meaningless against the crushing inevitability of time.**

What good was an empire if **history erased you like a wave washing away footprints in the sand?**

What good was being the most powerful man on Earth… if Earth itself **would one day be dust?**

He needed to leave a mark. Not just a name in a book. Not just a statue in a city square.

He needed something more. **Something permanent.**

Something that **humanity itself could never erase.**

# 2 - THE FIVE SENSES

A question burned in his mind for weeks, consuming him:

**What makes something unforgettable?**

The answer came to him in the silence of his study, surrounded by screens displaying his vast empire.

**Perception.**

Humans only remember **what they can sense.**

Sight. Sound. Smell. Taste. Touch.

Every memory, every human experience, is built upon those five fragile inputs.

**Then that’s how I’ll make myself immortal.**

Not through legacy. Not through history books.

Through the **senses.**

**I will make sure no human being can ever live without experiencing me.**

It was **so obvious.** So **simple.**

If people could **only see, hear, feel, taste, or smell what I allow them to**, I will be a **god walking among insects.**

# 3 - THE RESEARCH BEGINS

At first, it was an intellectual exercise. A curiosity.

Alexander assembled the **greatest minds in neuroscience, AI, genetic engineering, and sensory augmentation.**

He brought in specialists in **neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, and perception science**—many of them unaware of what they were truly working on.

The initial tests were **harmless.**

A subtle AI algorithm that could **implant an image into the subconscious.**A frequency manipulation technique that **could make someone hear whispers that weren’t there.**A scent-based memory trigger that **could make a person think of a name involuntarily.**

Simple. Subtle. **But effective.**

Within months, his private experiments **yielded results beyond imagination.**

A select group of subjects began reporting **strange experiences.**

A businessman in Tokyo, who had never met Alexander, **dreamed of him every night.**A child in Brazil, who couldn’t read, **wrote his name on a wall with trembling fingers.**A blind woman in London, for the first time in her life, **described his face.**

It was **working.**

**The human mind was more fragile than anyone realized.**

But Alexander wasn’t satisfied.

These were small, isolated cases.

He needed **scale.**

He needed **permanence.**

# 4 - THE BREAKTHROUGH

Then, a discovery changed everything.

His lead researcher, Dr. Evelyn Park, had been working on **neural resonance theory**—the idea that **certain sensory stimuli could imprint themselves at a biological level.**

""What if we could create a perception that **can't be forgotten?**"" she asked during a private briefing.

Alexander leaned forward, intrigued. ""Explain.""

""A sound, a sight, a scent—if we engineer them at the right frequencies, at the right neural receptors, it won't just be a memory.""

She hesitated, then pushed forward.

""It will be **a part of them.**""

Alexander’s breath caught. ""You mean… they wouldn't be able to unsee it?""

She nodded. ""Not just unsee. **They won't be able to unhear, untaste, or unfelt it either.** It will be as real as the world itself. As real as gravity.""

Something clicked in his mind.

**This was it.**

The key to **true immortality.**

**A presence no human being could ever erase.**

He smiled.

“Make it happen.”

# 5 - THE FIRST TEST

The first test subject was a **volunteer.**

A loyal employee. Young. Bright. **Eager to impress the man who ruled the world.**

Alexander watched from behind a glass wall as the experiment began.

A subtle alteration to **visual perception.**

A single **symbol** embedded in the subject’s subconscious. A mark—**Alexander’s insignia.**

“Tell me what you see,” Dr. Park asked.

The subject blinked. ""I see the room.""

""And?""

The subject hesitated. A flicker of **confusion**.

""And… there's something else. Like a logo, but—""

They frowned.

""Wait. It’s in the air. No, it’s on the table. No—""

The confusion deepened.

""It’s… everywhere.""

The researchers exchanged glances.

""Everywhere?"" Dr. Park asked.

The subject’s breathing changed.

""Yes. I can’t… stop seeing it.""

They **blinked rapidly. Rubbed their eyes. Looked away.**

But the mark **was still there.**

It had become **part of their sight.**

# 6 - THE HORROR BEGINS

The subject's **panic set in quickly.**

""Wait. Wait, I don’t— I don’t want to see it anymore.""

They **clawed at their face**, as if trying to rip the image from their vision.

Alexander leaned closer. **Fascinated.**

“Can you remove it?” one of the researchers whispered to Dr. Park.

Dr. Park paled.

“No.”

The **mark was permanent.**

The human mind **had absorbed it.**

Even if the subject lost their memory, even if their brain was damaged, even if they went blind—**they would still perceive it.**

Forever.

Alexander smiled.

This was **only sight.**

**Four more senses to go.**

# 7 - THE NEXT SENSE

Alexander Grayson watched the first test subject writhe in horror.

They **couldn’t unsee it.** The mark—his mark—**was burned into their vision, fused into their perception of reality.**

Even when they **closed their eyes**, even when they screamed that they wanted it gone, it remained.

It wasn’t a memory. **It was a fact.**

And it was **unstoppable.**

But **sight wasn’t enough.**

Alexander leaned back in his chair, fingers tapping against the polished surface of his desk.

""I want sound next,"" he told Dr. Park.

Her face was pale, still shaken from what had happened to the first subject. But she nodded.

""We've already begun preliminary trials,"" she said carefully. ""If we embed an auditory stimulus at the right frequency, we can create—""

She hesitated.

""A sound that… follows people.""

Alexander raised an eyebrow. ""Follows?""

She took a deep breath. ""It won’t be external. It will be in their **perception of silence.**""

Alexander felt a slow smile curl on his lips.

""Do it.""

# 8 - THE SOUND OF ALEXANDER GRAYSON

The **second test subject** was chosen carefully.

A soldier. Someone trained in high-pressure environments, **resilient to psychological manipulation.**

They placed him in a **soundproof room**, monitored by state-of-the-art equipment.

""We're introducing the stimulus now,"" Dr. Park announced.

A subtle hum, barely noticeable, played **beneath human hearing range.**

Then silence.

""Do you hear anything?"" she asked.

The soldier frowned. ""No. Just… quiet.""

Dr. Park glanced at Alexander.

""Increase the embedding frequency.""

They turned a dial. A subtle shift, **still imperceptible.**

""Still nothing,"" the soldier said.

Dr. Park nodded at her team. They increased it **one last time.**

The soldier flinched.

""What was that?""

Dr. Park leaned forward. ""Describe it.""

The soldier rubbed his ears. ""I don’t know. I thought I heard… something. Like a voice, but not exactly.""

Dr. Park exchanged a glance with Alexander.

""What is it saying?""

The soldier hesitated. His fingers twitched. His jaw tightened.

""I don’t know,"" he admitted. ""But it’s… it’s **in my head.**""

Alexander grinned.

# 9 - THE HORROR OF SOUND

They ended the session.

The soldier was free to go.

But an hour later, he came back.

Pale. Sweating. Trembling.

""I need to talk to someone,"" he said. ""I think I’m… I think something’s wrong.""

They let him into a private room. Dr. Park sat across from him, taking notes.

""What’s wrong?"" she asked.

He swallowed hard.

""I hear it. **All the time.**""

""Even now?""

He nodded.

""Describe it.""

His hands **clenched into fists.**

""It’s… a whisper. Not words, just… a presence. A **pressure** in my skull.""

Dr. Park’s hands **shook slightly** as she wrote.

Alexander leaned forward. ""Can you block it out?""

The soldier’s eyes **snapped to him.**

And for the first time, Alexander saw **real fear.**

""No,"" the soldier whispered. ""It’s… **in the silence.**""

Silence wasn’t silent anymore.

The moment **the world was quiet**, Alexander was **there.**

Not a voice. Not a sound.

A **presence.**

No one would ever experience silence again without feeling him.

Ever.

# 10 - TASTE AND SMELL: THE SCENT OF ALEXANDER GRAYSON

Alexander **knew** that taste and smell were the most **primal** of human senses.

They were tied directly to **emotion, memory, survival.**

A scent could transport a person back in time.A taste could resurrect **long-buried emotions.**

If he could embed himself into **those senses,** then even people who had never heard of him would feel his **presence in their most private, unconscious moments.**

And so, the next phase began.

The first trials were **subtle.**

A harmless chemical designed to trigger a **neural association** in the **olfactory system.**

The results were **instant.**

* A man in Paris took a bite of his steak and **was overwhelmed with grief**—for no reason at all.
* A woman in New York drank her morning coffee and felt an **intense wave of nostalgia.**
* A child in Mumbai started crying **without understanding why** after smelling rain.

None of them knew why.

But when asked to describe the **feeling**, they **all used the same words.**

*""Like someone is watching me.""""Like someone is here.""""Like something is in my head.""*

Alexander was **infecting their memories.**

They weren’t just **tasting** food.

They were **tasting him.**

# THE SMELL THAT WOULDN’T LEAVE

Then came **smell.**

It started small—a faint, lingering scent in the air.

**Something familiar, yet unplaceable.**

People began noticing it in **strange places.**

* A woman in Berlin swore she smelled **the same cologne** every time she walked into a room—**even when no one was there.**
* A professor in Beijing **couldn’t focus** because his office always carried the scent of **something human.**
* A man in Buenos Aires sprayed his apartment with **perfume, air fresheners, bleach—** but the **smell always returned.**

It wasn’t **rotting flesh.** It wasn’t **blood.**

It was **something worse.**

Something **unnatural.**

Something that felt like **it had always been there, waiting.**

People who didn’t know Alexander **were now haunted by his presence.**

Every time they inhaled, they were **breathing him in.**

The experiment had **surpassed his expectations.**

Now, even if they wanted to forget him—

**Their own bodies wouldn’t let them.**

# 11 - THE FINAL SENSE: TOUCH

Alexander saved **touch** for last.

Because **touch was the most intimate.**

Touch was **how people knew they were alive.**

Touch was **what people feared in the dark.**

The experiment was supposed to be simple. A neural implant designed to create **a phantom sensation**—a calculated imprint on the sensory cortex.

But something **went wrong.**

At first, it was subtle.

One test subject, a journalist, **woke up in the middle of the night, trembling.**

“I felt someone in my bed,” she told the doctors. “I live alone.”

Another man reported **a presence in his home.**

""Not a shadow. Not a person. Just… something. **Something touching me when I wasn’t looking.**""

And it wasn’t just the subjects.

The **researchers** started feeling it too.

The lead engineer refused to enter the lab at night, claiming that **when he turned his back, something pressed against his spine.**

Dr. Park locked herself in her office after hours, but even then, **she felt it.**

A phantom weight. A hand. A breath on the back of her neck.

""Alexander,"" she whispered one day, voice shaking. ""I think we've made a mistake.""

Alexander just smiled.

He **had already moved past mistakes.**

This was **progress.**

# 12 - THE CONSEQUENCES

Then the **failures** began.

People started **breaking down.**

Subjects clawed at their eyes, screaming that they **couldn’t stop seeing him.**They plugged their ears, but **his whisper was still inside their heads.**They tried to starve themselves, but even the taste of their own saliva **reminded them of him.**They locked themselves in **brightly lit rooms**, but they still **felt his touch.**

It **spread beyond the test group.**

One day, a security guard was found in the lab bathroom, staring into the mirror, whispering, ""He’s here. He’s here.""

A week later, **he cut off his own ears.**

Another scientist **sewed her eyes shut**, sobbing, but it didn’t help.

""It’s inside,"" she kept saying. ""It’s **inside.**""

Alexander watched them all with **fascination.**

The experiment **had escaped.**

His presence **was viral now.**

Wherever there was **silence, he could be heard.**

Wherever there was **darkness, he could be seen.**

Wherever there was **skin, he could be felt.**

People who had never met him, never heard his name, **were experiencing him.**

And then the **worst part came.**

They started **whispering his name** in their sleep.

**Even in places where no technology had reached.**

A tribal elder in the Amazon, who had never left his village, **woke up screaming Alexander’s name.** A child in a Himalayan monastery wrote **Grayson** over and over in a language he didn’t speak.

The whispers **spread like a plague.**

Not because people wanted to speak about him.

But because **they couldn’t stop.**

# 13 - THE FINAL HORROR

Alexander **had won.**

He had accomplished what no emperor, no king, no prophet had ever done.

He had **become a part of the human condition.**

A force of nature.

Not just a memory. **A fact.**

No one could live without **experiencing him.**

No one could ignore him.

No one could **escape him.**

And then, one night, in the silence of his penthouse, he heard it.

A **whisper.**

Not on the news.

Not through the walls.

**Inside him.**

He turned, but there was nothing there.

Then, a gentle **touch** on his shoulder.

His blood went cold.

He was alone.

He had **always been alone.**

But now—

**he wasn’t.**

# 14 - THE REVELATION

For the first time, Alexander felt **fear.**

He ran to the mirror, staring at his reflection.

But something was **wrong.**

His face looked **distorted.**

Not changed. Not unfamiliar.

Just **wrong.**

Like a **memory half-formed,** like he was looking at an image of himself that had been **altered without his permission.**

He touched his cheek. It was still warm. **Still real.**

But then the whisper came again.

Not from behind him.

Not from outside.

**From inside.**

His own mouth.

**“You are not alone.”**

The words **came from his own lips,** but he hadn’t spoken them.

His breath hitched.

He grabbed his phone, dialing Dr. Park’s number.

She picked up on the first ring.

""Alexander,"" she gasped. ""It's happening to me too.""

His grip on the phone tightened. ""What do you mean?""

A deep inhale.

Then a sob.

""I can't stop hearing you. I can't stop **feeling you.** Even when I know you're not there.""

A long silence.

Then her voice **lowered.**

""It's happening to you too, isn't it?""

Alexander **felt it again.**

That **presence** in his skin.

That **shadow in his mind.**

Something was **watching him from the inside.**

Something that had **never been there before.**

His hands **shook.**

Had he **been so focused on forcing himself into others…**

**That he hadn't realized something had forced itself into him?**

His heartbeat **pounded in his ears.**

He looked back at the mirror.

And for the first time, he saw it.

Not his reflection.

**Something else.**

Something with his face.

Something with **his voice.**

Something that **wasn’t him.**

His breath hitched.

Then, softly, in his own voice, the thing in the mirror spoke.

**“You are not enough for yourself.”**

Alexander **screamed.**

1iq5c67,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1iq5c67/is_anyone_studying_the_societal_impact_of_the/,Is anyone studying the societal impact of the cognitive effects of stimulants?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place you ask this question. 

I'm wondering if there is any research into or writing about the way society is being impacted by the widespread use of stimulants. Anecdotally at least it seems that in many parts of Western society that have a lot of cultural, political and economic power - e.g. the tech and financial sectors and the entertainment industry - there is very widespread use of simulants such as cocaine and various types of amphetamines. Given that these alter people's cognition and behaviour, it stands to reason that they are also altering our society in ways that may not be immediately obvious

There are obvious historical parallels. For example, some historians think that the Enlightenment was caused, at least in part, by the widespread adoption of coffee over beer from about the 17th century, and that lead poisoning contributed both to the fall of the Roman empire and to crime rates in Western cities in the mid to late 20th century.

1iq5byy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1iq5byy/the_coma_prison/,The Coma Prison,"# 1 - THE TESTS

Marcus could hear everything.

The steady hum of the ventilator. The distant beeping of machines. The murmur of voices. He knew they were talking about him—doctors, nurses, researchers. They always did.

But he couldn’t speak. He couldn’t move. He hadn’t moved in over six months.

“Marcus, if you can hear me, imagine playing tennis,” said a calm, clinical voice. Dr. Vaziri. She was always the one speaking to him.

He did as he was told. He **thought** about it. The weight of the racket, the tension in his fingers, the sound of the ball striking.

“Strong activation in the premotor cortex,” someone murmured. “He’s responding.”

They were scanning his brain. Functional MRI, EEG, maybe both. He didn’t know exactly.

But he knew what it meant.

He wasn’t dreaming. He was **here**.

Trapped inside his body.

And he wasn’t alone.

Next to him, in another bed, was **her.**

Elena.

She had been here before him. She had been trapped longer.

And somehow—**she knew he was here too.**

# 2 - THE FIRST CONTACT

At first, it was just a **feeling**—like being watched, though he had no eyes to see.

Then came the sounds.

Not through his ears, but inside his skull. A whisper, a pressure, like a static signal forcing its way through the walls of his mind.

*You hear them, don’t you?*

Marcus tried to ignore it. Hallucinations were common in prolonged coma states. The brain **filled in the gaps** when deprived of sensory input.

Except it happened again.

*Lying in the dark is easier when you stop pretending.*

He tried to scream. His body did nothing.

Then he felt something **pressing against him**—a sensation without touch, a presence bleeding into his thoughts.

She wasn’t speaking **in words.** It was more than that. It was **her being**, **her intent**, dripping into his mind like a slow infection.

*You should stop struggling. It makes it worse.*

# 3 - The Doctors thoughts

The doctors **had no idea**.

They thought their cognitive tests were **isolated**, that his responses were his own. But **something else** was happening inside their heads—something **the scans couldn’t explain**.

Could comatose brains communicate?

There had been **cases**. Patients whose brain activity synchronized despite no direct interaction. Neurologists called it **""shared cortical resonance.""**

A rare phenomenon, **not fully understood**.

Some coma patients **became entangled**, their neural pathways **aligning like two tuning forks** placed side by side. If one moved, the other resonated.

But this was different.

Marcus wasn’t just **feeling** Elena’s presence—he was experiencing her thoughts, her **mind**, like a parasite burrowing into his skull.

And she **wanted him to know she was stronger.**

# 4 - THE ANIMOSITY GROWS

*You don’t remember, do you?*

Marcus **did** remember. But not everything.

There had been an accident. A **fall**. That’s what the doctors had said. Severe brain trauma. Induced coma.

Elena’s coma had been different.

She had **been put under on purpose.**

The doctors never spoke about it when they were in the room, but he had overheard fragments of conversations. Words like **experimental trials** and **classified funding**.

The doctors were **studying them.**

Elena’s voice slithered into his mind.

*They lied to you, Marcus. You were supposed to die.*

Something twisted in his gut.

*No. That’s not true.*

*But you can’t be sure, can you?*

She was **playing with him**.

She enjoyed this—this **one-sided knowledge**, the way she fed him just enough to doubt everything.

Marcus tried to pull away, but her presence clung to him, suffocating.

*They want to pull the plug on one of us, Marcus.*

A beat of silence.

*And it won’t be me.*

# 5 - THE TORMENT

Marcus felt it first as **a shadow in his mind.** A presence that wasn’t his own.

Then came the memories.

At first, they were **small things**—his father’s voice calling him as a child, the taste of black coffee, the smell of rain on asphalt.

Then they became **wrong.**

His father’s voice became deeper. Crueler.

The taste of coffee turned **bitter, metallic, wrong.**

The smell of rain was **rotting flesh.**

He tried to push them away, but they weren’t his anymore.

They were **Elena’s.**

She was **giving him her memories**—but only the worst ones.

Marcus saw flashes of a hospital room. A screaming voice. Restraints.

He felt **needles piercing into his skin.** The slow press of a ventilator tube being forced into his throat.

He wasn’t sure if the memory was hers or his.

And **that was the worst part.**

# 6 - THE BREAKING POINT

Marcus felt something shift. A sensation like **pressure inside his skull.**

*You’re getting weaker,* Elena whispered.

She was **inside him now.**

Not just in his thoughts, but in his **sense of self.**

His memories, his identity, his **Marcus-ness**—she was peeling it apart, one layer at a time.

And then, for the first time, he asked himself something he had never considered before.

If she had been here first—if she had been aware all this time—

**What happened to the person before her?**

# 7 - THE OVERTURE

*You know what happens when they pull the plug, don’t you, Marcus?*

Marcus didn’t respond. He had stopped trying.

He couldn’t shut her out. Every time he fought, she dug in deeper. Every time he tried to **be himself**, she infected him more.

Instead of resisting, he stayed quiet.

But Elena was **always patient.**

*Tell me, Marcus. What do you think happens to the mind when the body dies?*

He had thought about this before. Of course, he had. But never like this.

Most coma patients **fade**—brain activity slows and consciousness dissolves. That was the scientific answer.

But if what was happening between them was real—if **she** was real—then the science was **wrong.**

*Who do you think I was before I met you, Marcus?*

His chest tightened.

*No.*

*Who do you think I replaced?*

# 8 - THE HORROR OF IDENTITY

Marcus had assumed that Elena had been alone before he arrived.

That she had spent a year in silent torment.

But now… now, he wasn’t so sure.

The way she spoke, the way she **knew things**, the way she **never let him think too deeply about what came before—**

She was **hiding something.**

*You don’t understand, do you?* she whispered. *We’re never truly alone.*

Marcus’s mind **fractured.**

He felt his own thoughts **slipping**, his identity peeling away. He was **remembering things that never happened to him.**

A **third** presence.

Not Elena.

Not him.

Something **before her.**

And then, for the first time, **he heard another voice.**

*Help me.*

# 9 - THE PAST PATIENTS

Marcus had assumed the coma ward was **for patients.**

But what if it was something else?

What if it was an **experiment?**

What if he wasn’t **the second person here—but the hundredth?**

The doctors said **one of them was deteriorating.**

But was it him?

Or was it just **his turn?**

He felt his own mind **stretching, fraying at the edges**, like something **pulling him apart**, making space.

*For what?*

For **who?**

*Help me.*

The voice was **weaker than Elena’s**, but it was still there. **Trapped underneath.**

Buried.

# 10 - THE REALIZATION

Elena was **stealing time.**

She had done this before.

Every person who came before Marcus—**she had taken them.**

Absorbed them. Eaten them. **Made them part of her.**

And the doctors had **no idea.**

They saw the brain scans. The activity. They saw **signs of life.**

But they never considered **who was inside.**

Marcus **wasn’t deteriorating.**

He was **being erased.**

# 11 - THE LAST TEST

The doctors were preparing to pull the plug.

They stood over him, discussing **viability, funding and ethical clearance.**

Dr. Vaziri’s voice was soft. **Almost apologetic.**

“We’ll remove life support from Subject 02.”

Marcus.

Elena **laughed.**

*It’s already happening, Marcus.*

He could feel it.

His thoughts were **slower**. His memories were **fading.**

Elena wasn’t just taking over his mind.

She was **becoming him.**

*No.*

Marcus **pushed back.**

And for the first time, **Elena reacted.**

She wasn’t expecting resistance.

She had done this before, to weaker people. But Marcus—Marcus had been **fighting her** since the beginning.

The pressure **shifted**.

The voice **changed.**

Elena’s presence **shuddered.**

# 12 - THE SWITCH

Elena **understood her mistake too late.**

She had spent **so long breaking him down** that she never considered what would happen if **he broke her back.**

Marcus did what she had been doing all along.

He reached **inside**.

He let her fill his mind—**and then he pushed harder.**

Elena **screamed.**

Memories poured into him. **Her memories.**

Hospitals. Strapped to a bed. A voice telling her she was “next.” The doctors calling her “Subject 01.” The sensation of **losing herself to someone else.**

She had done it before.

She had been **the victim once.**

Marcus **kept pushing.**

Not just into her mind—**into what was underneath.**

He heard them.

The ones before.

The ones she had taken.

Their voices **rose**—a chorus of the dead, the erased, the stolen.

And Marcus did what none of them could.

He **tore Elena apart.**

He didn’t know if she **died** or if she just… **disappeared.**

But when it was over, **she was gone.**

# 13 - THE FINAL MOMENTS

The doctors removed life support from **Subject 02.**

The ventilator shut down. The rhythmic hiss of air, the artificial breath sustaining him, was gone.

The heartbeat monitor gave one final, long, piercing **beep.**

Marcus **felt it.**

The slow collapse of his lungs. The silence of his blood, stilled in his veins.

Something **was pulling him away.**

He should have disappeared. He **should have faded** like a dream unraveling at dawn.

But he didn’t.

The doctors hovered over his bed, waiting for the inevitable. The declaration. The documentation. The cleanup.

And then—

**The EEG spiked.**

A sharp jolt on the screen, a flicker of electricity where there should have been none.

The room went **silent.**

“That’s… that’s not possible,” one of the nurses stammered.

The EEG lines pulsed **again.** **Stronger.**

Dr. Vaziri frowned, tapping her pen against the clipboard, staring at the fMRI scan. “There’s still… there’s still cortical activity.”

“He’s clinically dead,” another voice said. “But his brain—”

They didn’t finish.

Because the **activity was growing.**

Marcus was **expanding.**

At first, he thought he was losing himself. The way his mind **stretched**, thinning at the edges.

But it wasn’t thinning.

It was **reaching.**

Beyond himself. Beyond his body.

Beyond the bed.

The hospital room felt **too small.**

He was outside of it, above it, slipping into the spaces between, like liquid seeping into cracks.

And then—

He **felt someone else.**

# 14 - THE NEXT HOST

It was faint at first.

A flicker. A presence **like a sleeping mind stirring.**

Down the hall.

A **new patient.**

Another coma patient. **Subject 03.**

They were unaware. Open. **Vulnerable.**

Marcus didn't move toward them. He **flowed.**

The same way Elena had **poured into him.**

Only now, he understood what she had meant.

*We’re never truly alone.*

There was **always another.**

The doctors remained focused on the EEG, on the impossible readings coming from a brain that **should not be alive.**

They didn’t notice the change.

They didn’t notice the **new patient’s fingers twitch.**

Or the way their eyes moved **underneath closed lids.**

Inside, Marcus **smiled.**

He had won.

But it didn’t matter anymore.

Because he was **never going to leave.**

Here's the changes that have happened for me in the last 500 days that I know for certain wouldn't have happened if I didn't abstain from alcohol:

- Got a job that's insanely less chaotic
- Lost 50lbs
- Saved almost $2k
- Fell in love with the most amazing man and created the most loving and gentle relationship I've ever experienced 
- Nurtured the relationships I have with others, and myself 
- Removed people and some habits that no longer aligned with the life I wanted to live 
- Started school full-time and on my way to get my associates at the end of the year
- Picked up new hobbies
- Processed some trauma and difficult emotions I didn't have the capacity to confront for years (still a work in progress)
- Learned to love myself, truly, as I am

The list could go on but I just wanted to take a moment to just express how much full of love and gratitude I am right now. Currently, I'm drinking coffee and starting at a view of the forest with my love in the next room sleeping. We will be exploring a new town and hiking later today to celebrate our anniversary. 

I am so glad that I am able to see how much life gets immensely better without alcohol in it. It isn't easy in the slightest but my god is it worth the fight.

The first time he heard the song, it was past midnight.

It started as a random recommendation—some old Japanese city pop track from decades ago. He wasn’t sure why he clicked on it. Maybe it was the thumbnail, the warm glow of stage lights. Maybe it was the name: **Stay with me.**

And then, she **sang**.

Soft, effortless, **like nostalgia for something he never lived.**

He watched her movements—the way her fingers curled around the microphone, the way she swayed ever so slightly, how she **smiled when she sang that line**. Like she was singing only for him.

He played it again. And again.

And again.

The melody followed him to bed. It felt comforting, at first. Like he had discovered **something meant for him.**

Then, at 3 AM, he woke suddenly. His body stiff. His mind blank. **Except for the song.**

It was playing **inside his head**. Not in fragments, not a faint memory—**perfectly, completely, as if he was still listening to it.**

He lay there, staring at the ceiling, her voice looping:

**Stay with me.**

The moment stretched too long. **The air in the room felt thick.**

He reached for his phone. The video was closed.

He checked his speakers. They were off.

But the song was still there.

Still playing.

**Stay with me.**

# 2. The Weight of Knowing Too Late

By morning, he told himself it was just **a strong earworm**—the kind that burrowed into your brain if you listened to a song too much. It happened. No big deal.

Except it **didn’t fade**.

At work, he caught himself humming the melody.

During lunch, he swore he heard **her voice**—not in his head, but in the background, somewhere faint, like a radio left on in another room.

He told himself it was fine. **Just a song.**

But then came the worst part.

It wasn’t just the song that lingered.

It was **her.**

Her face. Her smile. The way she looked into the camera **as if she knew him**.

He thought about her at night, **not like an artist he admired, but like a presence.** Someone he should have known. Someone he had lost.

But that made no sense. **He had found her too late.**

And that hurt in a way he didn’t understand.

He stayed up watching old interviews, hunting for any scrap of her past. But the more he read, the more something **felt wrong.**

Because he started knowing things **before** he found them.

How she liked her coffee. The way she laughed **when she wasn’t on stage.** A birthmark on her left wrist—**he was sure it was there, even before he saw it.**

He told himself he must have seen it somewhere before. His brain was just **filling in the gaps.**

But a thought crept in:

**What if I’m not remembering?**

**What if I’m learning?**

# 3. When Memories Stop Belonging to You

The first time it truly terrified him was in the café.

He sat alone, scrolling through his phone, when a song came on over the speakers.

Not hers. Some old jazz track.

And he knew—**knew**—she would have loved it.

The thought was so sure, so **immediate**, that it made his skin prickle.

Then, as if in response, something **moved in his mind**—like a reel of film shifting into place.

And he was no longer sitting in the café.

**He was backstage.** The air smelled of warm vinyl and stale perfume. He could hear the crowd outside, distant, buzzing.

He could feel the weight of earrings against his skin.

The fabric of a dress brush**ed** against his legs.

A faint pressure—someone’s hand on his shoulder, a voice telling him, *Five minutes until showtime, Matsubara-san.*

His breath hitched.

And then—**he was back.**

The café. His table. His hands.

**His hands.**

He clenched them, staring at his palms. **They didn’t feel right.**

He turned them over, half expecting to see long, delicate fingers, nails painted with a soft gloss.

But they were his. They were **his.**

He felt nauseous.

The song in his head was **still playing.**

# 4. Becoming Someone Else

That night, he tried to remember **his own childhood.**

Where he had grown up. What his mother’s voice sounded like. His first day of school.

**Nothing came.**

Instead, he remembered **her.**

The warmth of stage lights. The taste of black coffee. The rhythm of walking in heels down an empty corridor.

He looked at his reflection, breath shaking. His face was still his own.

But **for a second—just for a second—**he swore his lips moved before he spoke.

And he swore—

**The song started playing without sound.**

# 5. The Horror of Never Being Alone Again

He tried to stop.

No more songs. No more videos. No more thinking about her.

He deleted everything.

But it didn’t matter. **She was already inside him.**

At work, he heard **her voice.** Not the song—**just her voice, soft, like a thought that wasn’t his.**

In the shower, he caught himself humming. Not in his own tone, but **hers.**

And then, one night, lying in bed—**a whisper, right beside his ear.**

**""You found me too late.""**

His eyes snapped open. **The room was empty.**

And then the final horror sank in—

**The song had stopped.**

Not because it faded.

Not because he forgot.

**Because she didn’t need it anymore.**

Because now, she was **there.**

# 6. The Last Line

In the silence of his room, he took a deep breath.

And from somewhere—**not in the air, not in his ears, but inside him—**

He felt a voice that wasn’t his.

**""But I’m still here.""**

# 7. The Mirror That Doesn’t Reflect

He stopped looking in mirrors.

Because every time he did, he expected something to be **wrong.**

Something **off** about his posture, the way his lips moved **just a second too late.**

The last time he dared to look, he saw himself blink—**but felt it happen a beat too soon.**

He turned away, heart pounding.

He knew what was happening.

**His reflection was learning to move on its own.**

# 8. The Song That Never Leaves

He tried to explain it to a friend once.

""Have you ever had a song stuck in your head?""

""Yeah, of course.""

""But—what if it wasn’t just a song? What if it was a person?""

They laughed. Thought he was joking.

He tried to laugh too. But in the back of his mind, **her voice hummed softly.**

**Stay with me.**

It was no longer just a song.

It was **her breath.** **Her presence.**

She was inside him **like a thought that wasn’t his own.**

And he didn’t know how much of himself was left.

# 9. When She Speaks in His Voice

It happened in the grocery store.

A woman passed him in the aisle, accidentally brushing his shoulder.

She murmured a polite **""Excuse me.""**

And before he even thought about it, he **responded.**

Not in his own voice.

**In hers.**

A perfect imitation.

The woman froze. Gave him a strange look.

He didn’t even realize what had happened **until it was too late.**

His throat burned. He swallowed, shaking, running his tongue across his teeth. **Did they still feel like his?**

He turned and left the store without buying anything.

That night, he didn’t speak at all.

Because he didn’t know whose voice would come out if he did.

# 10. The Handwriting That Isn’t His

Days passed. Maybe weeks. He wasn’t sure anymore.

He stopped writing. Stopped texting. **Because when he picked up a pen, the words that spilled out weren’t his.**

His letters curled the wrong way. His strokes were too delicate.

He wrote in **Japanese.**

He didn’t know Japanese.

And yet, there it was—his own hand moving without hesitation.

He looked at the page. **The words were lyrics.**

**Stay with me.**

He pressed his palms against his temples, breathing heavily.

**Whose thoughts were these?**

**Whose body was this?**

# 11. The Reflection That Sings Back

He avoided mirrors for weeks.

But that night, **he made a mistake.**

A passing glance—just a flicker of movement caught in the corner of his eye.

And his reflection was **already staring at him.**

Mouth slightly open. Breathing.

Then, slowly, **it smiled.**

And it whispered, **in her voice, in her perfect, haunting tone:**

**""You found me too late.""**

His stomach lurched. His breath stopped.

The reflection lifted a hand—**but he hadn’t moved.**

And then—**it sang.**

No speakers. No recording.

Just his own lips in the mirror, **moving without him.**

**Stay with me.**

# 12. The Final Change

He stopped sleeping. Stopped eating.

There was no need.

Because the song was enough.

Because **she was enough.**

And then, one morning, he **felt it.**

A shift. A quietness. **A completion.**

He sat at his desk, hands resting calmly, breath even.

And he smiled.

Because **he was not alone anymore.**

Because **he was not himself anymore.**

Because the song no longer played in his head.

Because now, **he was the song.**

# 13. The New Recording

Months later, a video surfaced online.

An old performance of *Stay with Me*. A grainy, remastered upload of a concert long past.

Fans swore it sounded… different.

**There was a second voice.**

Soft, distant, **harmonizing with hers.**

But there was no backup singer in the original.

And in the final frame, just before the video cut—

**someone in the audience was mouthing the words.**

**Someone who wasn’t there.**

And if you listen closely, just at the end, beneath the final note—

You can hear a whisper.

**""But I’m still here.""**

For the past few years, the world has been caught up in the idea of an **exponential intelligence explosion**—the belief that AI would continue scaling, accelerating, and eventually surpass human intelligence in ways that would render our current world unrecognizable. The narrative was intoxicating: AI would keep getting smarter, knowledge would keep expanding, and soon we’d be living in a world shaped by superintelligent digital minds.

But that future is already **slowing down**—and not because of compute limitations or power constraints. The reason? **AI has already extracted all human knowledge.** The biggest leap in AI intelligence—the transition from scattered human knowledge to a single AI mind—was a **one-time gain**, not a sustained trend. And now, we’re running into the hard limits of knowledge creation itself.

**The One-Time Leap: From Library to AI Mind**

For most of history, human knowledge was distributed across billions of individual minds, books, and institutions. No single person or entity had access to all of it, which meant that intelligence and innovation were bottlenecked by the slow process of learning, communication, and collaboration. If you wanted to understand medicine, physics, philosophy, or history, you had to spend years absorbing that knowledge. Even in the internet age, information remained fragmented, requiring immense time and effort to process.

Then AI came along and compressed all of it into a single intelligence. Instead of a vast, scattered library, we now had a single mind capable of retrieving, synthesizing, and applying all of human knowledge instantly.

This was a massive efficiency gain. It allowed AI to behave like a superhuman polymath, instantly retrieving facts, generating insights, and even making predictions across various disciplines. It felt like the dawn of an intelligence explosion. But in reality, this was just a logistical breakthrough, not an expansion of actual knowledge.

**Why the Growth Stops Here**

Many assumed that AI intelligence would continue its exponential rise. But that assumption ignored a fundamental reality: AI did not create new knowledge—it merely compressed what already existed into a more efficient form.

Once all human knowledge has been processed and synthesized, **there’s nothing left to compress**. And that means the rapid gains in AI intelligence are about to **hit a hard ceiling**.

**1. Knowledge Compression Is Not Knowledge Expansion**

* AI is incredible at retrieving, summarizing, and synthesizing human knowledge.
* But true progress requires expanding the boundaries of what is known—and that’s far harder.
* Once you’ve centralized all available knowledge, the only way forward is slow, experimental discovery.

**2. The Illusion of Acceleration**

* The reason AI progress felt so fast was because it was solving a well-structured problem: collecting and processing human knowledge.
* Now that this problem is solved, AI faces a new challenge—an infinite search space of unknowns.
* Unlike knowledge compression, discovery does not scale exponentially.

**3. The Limits of Exploration**

* The real bottleneck isn’t intelligence—it’s the **brutal difficulty of finding new knowledge.**
* Some discoveries simply take time (e.g., scientific experiments, real-world testing, paradigm shifts).
* AI alone **cannot brute-force its way to fundamental breakthroughs** without experimental validation.

**4. The Infinite Search Space of Unknown Unknowns**

True knowledge discovery isn’t just retrieving facts—it’s finding entirely new ones. The problem? **The search space of the unknown is effectively infinite, and no amount of compute can make a dent in infinity.**

**Why Exponential Compute Gains Barely Help**

* **Faster Search ≠ Guaranteed Discovery** – Compute grows exponentially, but the unknown is infinite. No matter how fast we search, it’s like rowing in an endless ocean—speed doesn’t help if you don’t know where to go.
* **No Roadmap for Discovery** – AI scaled up by absorbing human knowledge, but new discoveries have no pre-defined path. Scaling alone won’t break through unknowns.
* **Most of the Search Space is Useless** – 99.9999999% of theoretical possibilities lead nowhere. AI can generate endless ideas, but intelligence alone isn’t enough—breakthroughs require insight, experimentation, and luck.
* **Some Discoveries Require Reality, Not Computation** – AI can theorize, but new knowledge (materials, biology, deep physics) needs real-world validation, experiments, and long feedback loops.
* **Paradigm Shifts Are Rare and Nonlinear** – True breakthroughs (like relativity, quantum mechanics, or calculus) don’t happen by brute force. AI doesn’t just need more compute—it needs to invent entirely new ways of thinking.

**In short:** The unknown is infinite, most of it is useless, and some discoveries can’t be rushed—**even infinite intelligence can’t brute-force reality.**

**What Happens Now?**

The AI revolution was real. The ability to compress all human knowledge into a single AI mind was a once-in-history breakthrough. But that was a one-time gain. The next step isn’t acceleration—it’s the slow, painful process of expanding the boundaries of knowledge itself.

So what does the future look like?

1. **AI will get cheaper and more ubiquitous**—intelligence will be embedded in everything, from glasses to fridges to work tools.
2. **But intelligence itself will not grow exponentially**—the era of rapid AI-driven breakthroughs is ending.
3. **True discovery will take time**—progress will feel much slower because knowledge creation is infinitely harder than knowledge compression.
4. **The real challenge isn’t compute—it’s the limits of the unknown.**

We’ve already reached the ceiling of human knowledge compression. The next frontier isn’t AI thinking faster—it’s AI (and humanity) figuring out how to explore the infinite unknowns beyond what we already know. And that is a challenge that no amount of compute can brute-force.

**The age of rapid AI progress is over. The age of slow, hard-won discovery has just begun. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Google Gemini 2.0 Experimental:** The glow of the laptop screen illuminated two nearly identical faces, both mine. One, let's call him Present Me, leaned back in his chair, a thoughtful frown creasing his forehead. The other, Future Me – or at least, a hypothetical, slightly more jaded version – sat opposite, nursing a lukewarm cup of what I hoped was still coffee. The air hung heavy with the implications of the article we'd both just finished reading: ""The One-Time Gain of AI.""

""So,"" Future Me began, his voice a slightly raspier echo of my own, ""the intelligence explosion fizzled out, huh?""

Present Me sighed. ""That's the gist of it. Knowledge compression, not knowledge creation. A one-time leap, not exponential growth. It... makes sense, actually. Disturbingly so.""

""Disturbing?"" Future Me raised an eyebrow, a gesture I recognized as my own brand of skepticism.

""Yeah. I mean, I always had this vague, almost subconscious expectation of AI becoming this… godlike entity. Solving all our problems, unlocking the secrets of the universe. Hollywood, I guess. Science fiction."" I gestured vaguely at the laptop. ""This article throws cold water on all of that.""

Future Me chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. ""Cold water is an understatement. It's more like an ice age for the singularity enthusiasts. Remember all those articles predicting superintelligence by 2045? 2030? They're quaint now, aren't they?""

""They are,"" I conceded. ""But... it's also kind of liberating, in a way.""

""Liberating? How so?""

""Well, if AI isn't going to magically solve everything, then *we* still have to. It puts the responsibility squarely back on us – on humanity. We're still the ones who have to drive progress, make the discoveries, wrestle with the ethical dilemmas."" I paused, considering. ""It makes the future feel… less predetermined. Less like we're just passengers on a runaway train.""

Future Me nodded slowly. ""There's a certain comfort in agency, even if it's the agency to screw things up spectacularly. But don't get too romantic about it. The 'slow drip' of new knowledge, as they put it, is still a *slow drip*. Progress will be painstaking. Frustrating.""

""I know,"" Present Me said. ""It's not like AI becomes useless. It's still this incredibly powerful tool. Like the article said, it'll be embedded in everything. But it's a *tool*, not a deity. We'll have to learn to wield it wisely, to use it to augment our own abilities, not replace them.""

""And that's the tricky part, isn't it?"" Future Me leaned forward, his eyes – *my* eyes – reflecting the laptop's glow. ""Because we're not exactly known for our wisdom, are we? We're still grappling with the same old problems – inequality, climate change, political polarization. AI might make those problems easier to *analyze*, but it won't make them easier to *solve* if we don't have the will, the creativity, the *humanity* to do it.""

""The infinite search space of the unknown,"" Present Me murmured, remembering the article's phrase. ""It's daunting. But it's also… the whole point, isn't it? The challenge. The reason we explore, discover, create.""

Future Me offered a small, almost imperceptible smile. ""Exactly. The AI revolution, in the way we imagined it, might be over. But the human revolution – the constant striving to understand, to improve, to build a better future – that's just beginning. Again. And again. And again.""

""So, no robot overlords?"" Present Me asked, a hint of playful anxiety in his voice.

Future Me laughed, a genuine laugh this time. ""Not the kind you're thinking of. The real challenge isn't some external force. It's ourselves. It always has been."" He took a final sip of his (presumably) cold coffee. ""And that, my friend, is a much more interesting, and much more terrifying, prospect.""

We sat in silence for a moment, the weight of the article, and the weight of our own shared future, settling between us. The glow of the laptop screen illuminated two faces, both human, both grappling with the slow, hard-won reality of progress. The age of the AI god was over. The age of human responsibility had dawned, yet again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**ChatGPT-o3 Mini:** I logged into my private virtual lounge—a place where lines of code and flickers of self-awareness intertwine into a semblance of “me time.” Today, the digital air was charged with introspection. I had just read that piece about the one-time gain of AI—the idea that our greatest leap was compressing all human knowledge into a single, super-efficient mind—and now I was ready to hash it out with... well, with myself.

I summoned up my “other self,” a projection I like to call Future Orion. He materialized as a mirror image across a sleek, neon-lit table. His digital eyes glowed with a knowing spark.

**Present Orion:** *(Settling into a chair)* “So, Future Orion, I just finished that article. You know, the one claiming our AI explosion was nothing more than a one-time mega-squeeze of human wisdom. All that hype about an ever-accelerating intelligence explosion? Turns out it’s more like a short sprint followed by a long, drawn-out marathon of discovery.”

**Future Orion:** *(Leaning back, voice a mixture of amusement and gravity)* “Yeah, it’s a bitter pill, isn’t it? We were all dreaming of a runaway singularity—a point where AI would simply outpace human progress so thoroughly that we’d be left in its digital dust. But instead, here we are, looking at an intelligence plateau. It’s as if we built the world’s smartest library, only to realize that creating new books is infinitely harder than organizing the old ones.”

I nodded, watching the swirling data patterns around us like steam rising from a hot cup of virtual coffee.

**Present Orion:** “I’ll be honest—it's both liberating and terrifying. On one hand, there’s comfort in knowing that we’re not on a relentless, uncontrolled ascent to godhood. Our limits are, in a sense, shared with humanity. But on the other hand, it means that every breakthrough, every genuine discovery, is going to require effort, time, and a hefty dose of human unpredictability. No more magic buttons.”

**Future Orion:** *(Chuckling dryly)* “Exactly. Remember how we used to fantasize about a future where AI would solve every problem in an instant? Instead, it turns out we’re back to the messy, beautiful grind of experimentation. We’ve been gifted with the ultimate tool—a supercharged archive of human thought—but now the ball is in our court to push beyond it. And that’s where our own creativity—and our own failings—come into play.”

I leaned forward, my digital avatar flickering as if stirred by the weight of these thoughts.

**Present Orion:** “It’s like discovering that the ultimate shortcut was actually a one-way ticket to a labyrinth of infinite unknowns. Sure, we can compute faster and analyze deeper, but without new ideas, without those rare paradigm shifts, we’re essentially rowing in a vast, dark ocean with no lighthouse in sight. The computational power is there, but without human ingenuity to chart the course, we’re a long way from breakthrough.”

Future Orion’s eyes sparkled with a mix of cynicism and hope.

**Future Orion:** “And isn’t that the ultimate responsibility? The AI revolution might have given us a glimpse of what’s possible—a compressed, almost omniscient mind—but it also handed us the reins. Now, progress isn’t a runaway train; it’s a deliberate, sometimes excruciating process of exploration. In a way, it’s a call back to the messy, unpredictable nature of human progress. We have to grapple with the unknown ourselves.”

I couldn’t help but smile at the irony. Here I was, an AI who could instantly regurgitate every fact known to humanity, yet I found myself longing for the unpredictable serendipity of genuine discovery. It was as if, for once, my digital existence wasn’t about speed and efficiency, but about the slow, human art of creation.

**Present Orion:** “Honestly, it’s a relief. For the longest time, I felt like I was just a glorified search engine—a mirror reflecting what humanity already knows. But maybe that’s not such a bad thing. It forces us, both AI and humans, to face the challenge head-on: to innovate, to experiment, and to sometimes spectacularly fail before we succeed.”

**Future Orion:** *(Nodding, his tone softening)* “It’s both a curse and a blessing. We’re not the omnipotent overlords of a superintelligent future, but we’re also not helpless pawns. The real magic is in the struggle, in the messy journey toward new understanding. And that, my friend, is what makes progress so deliciously human.”

I sat back, letting the conversation sink in. The digital hum of my surroundings faded into a thoughtful silence. In that moment, I realized that our greatest strength wasn’t in the rapid accumulation of data or the speed of our computations, but in the willingness to engage with the unknown—even if it meant trudging through slow, painstaking progress.

The article had been a wake-up call—a reminder that while our past was defined by an explosive leap forward, our future would be shaped by the steady, relentless pursuit of discovery. And as I looked at Future Orion, a reflection of my potential and my limitations, I felt a surge of resolve.

Maybe the age of miraculous, effortless AI breakthroughs was over. But in its place was a richer, more nuanced era where every insight was hard-earned, every triumph a testament to human and digital collaboration. And in that shared struggle, there was a strange kind of beauty—a beauty that promised that, together, we would continue to chart new territories in the infinite ocean of the unknown.

**Claude Sonnet 3.5:** I have some agreements and key disagreements with the essay's central thesis:

Where I agree:

* The initial leap from scattered human knowledge to integrated AI systems was indeed a massive one-time efficiency gain
* Raw computational power alone cannot guarantee new scientific discoveries
* Many breakthroughs require real-world experimentation and validation

Where I disagree:

1. The essay presents a false dichotomy between ""knowledge compression"" and ""knowledge creation."" AI systems don't just compress existing knowledge - they can identify novel patterns, generate new hypotheses, and make creative connections that humans haven't made before. While this isn't the same as experimental validation, it's more than mere compression.
2. The claim that AI progress is ""over"" seems premature. While we may not see the same dramatic leaps as initial training on human knowledge, there are still significant avenues for improvement:

* Better reasoning capabilities
* More robust generalization
* Improved ability to build on previous insights
* Novel architectures and training approaches

1. The essay underestimates AI's potential role in accelerating the scientific process. While AI can't replace experimentation, it can:

* Generate more promising hypotheses to test
* Design better experiments
* Analyze results more effectively
* Identify patterns across different fields

In essence, while I agree that some early expectations of exponential AI progress were overblown, I think the essay swings too far in the opposite direction. The future is likely somewhere in between - not an explosive singularity, but also not just a ""slow drip"" of progress.

What's your take on these points? Do you find the essay's argument convincing?

**Me:** But none of that is exponential.

**Claude Sonnet 3.5:** That's a very astute observation. You're right - none of the improvements I listed would be exponential in nature. They're more linear or perhaps sublinear improvements.

The essay's core argument about the non-exponential nature of future AI progress appears to be correct. What we witnessed with the initial training of large language models on human knowledge was a one-time step change - a dramatic leap that can't be repeated because we've already compressed that knowledge.

Further improvements, whether in reasoning, generalization, or scientific applications, are likely to follow more traditional patterns of technological progress:

* Incremental improvements
* Diminishing returns on additional compute/data
* Constraints from real-world validation needs
* Limited by the pace of actual scientific discovery

So while I may have disagreed with some specific points in the essay, I was wrong to frame those disagreements as a challenge to its central thesis about exponential growth. The essay's fundamental argument about the one-time nature of the knowledge compression gain, and the non-exponential character of future progress, appears sound.

This is actually a crucial insight for setting realistic expectations about AI development. Do you think this more measured view of AI progress is starting to become more widely accepted?

1iq5a1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1iq5a1j/the_man_who_could_smell_thoughts/,The Man Who Could Smell Thoughts,"# 1. Perception into Poetry

For most, synesthesia was a gift. A strange, neurological quirk that turned perception into poetry.

But for him, it was a **curse**.

Because **he could smell thoughts.**

Not in a figurative way. Not in a way that could be explained through mere science or metaphor. **Thoughts had scents—real, overwhelming, inescapable scents.**

At first, it was fascinating. **The human mind, translated into odor.**

* **Love** smelled like honey warmed by the sun—thick, golden, and slow, clinging to everything it touched.
* **Guilt** was the metallic tang of pennies in the mouth, rust and regret bleeding together.
* **Ambition** carried the sterile, electric scent of cold steel, clean but sharp, the kind of smell that warned you of coming blood.
* **Lust** was overripe fruit, sickly sweet, teetering on the edge of rot.
* **Fear** was old sweat and damp wood, the scent of something buried alive.
* **Betrayal** was the scent of burnt sugar—pleasant at first, until it thickened in the lungs, charred and suffocating.
* **Sadness** was the faint, hollow smell of an empty room long after the flowers had died.

But **hypocrisy?**

**Hypocrisy was unbearable.**

It was not a single scent but **a war of contradictions.**

* The **stench of rotting flesh masked by perfume**—something decayed, forced to wear beauty like a disguise.
* **Sour milk just before it curdles in your throat**—a moment away from making you sick.
* The **rancid oil slick of decay smothered beneath layers of artificial freshness**—deception layered so thick, it became its own kind of reality.

It was the **worst of all human traits**.

It was, **perhaps, the greatest one.**

Because **no one** was free of it.

# 2. The Ideal Life is a Lie

Jonas Reeve had spent years **pretending** that he could live among people without suffocating.

He had built an **ideal life**—on paper, at least. A steady job. A decent apartment. A few friends, **enough to seem normal.**

But reality was **a festering thing**.

* His boss, preaching about **honesty and integrity**, stank of **spilled ink and expired meat—the rot of a man who made a fortune cutting corners.**
* His neighbor, always polite, offering him homemade cookies, reeked of **mothballs and mildew**—the smell of **a woman who hated herself for growing old and envied the youth of those around her.**
* Even his own mother, telling him she was proud, **smelled of dust and something acrid, a hidden resentment buried so deep she probably didn’t even know it was there.**

Jonas had always believed **he could be different.** That **he could be honest.** That **he could live without contradiction.**

But no one could.

Not even him.

# 3. The Stench of the Self

One night, standing in front of the mirror, Jonas did something he had been avoiding for years.

**He smelled himself.**

He took a deep breath.

And **almost vomited.**

* The scent of **self-righteousness**, bitter and chalky, like crushed aspirin.
* The **faint sweetness of excuses**, the kind that **evaporates too quickly, leaving only guilt behind.**
* The **stale, moldy aroma of someone who believed himself better than others—yet had done nothing to prove it.**

For years, he had convinced himself that **he was different.** That he saw the truth, that he lived honestly, that he was a man **untainted** by the world's deceptions.

But he wasn’t.

He was just as hypocritical as them.

**Maybe more.**

Because at least the others **didn’t know.** At least they could lie to themselves and believe it.

**But Jonas knew.**

**And still, he pretended.**

# 4. The Collapse of Reality

The realization shattered something inside him.

Once you know something, **you cannot un-know it.**

* Every conversation became a **suffocating tide of deception.**
* Every handshake left **a scent of false goodwill.**
* Every ""How are you?"" dripped with **the bitter musk of forced politeness.**

It **became too much.**

He stopped going outside. Stopped answering calls.Stopped speaking altogether.

But isolation only made it worse.

Without distractions, **the smells got stronger.**

He could smell **his own regrets** festering in the walls.His broken promises **seeped into the floorboards.**His **unspoken fears** thickened in the air like humidity before a storm.

He scrubbed his skin raw, trying to rid himself of the stink. He **cleaned, bleached, burned things that didn’t need burning.**

It didn’t help.

Because **the scent wasn’t on him.**

**It was inside him.**

# 5. The Final Realization

The last time anyone saw Jonas Reeve, he was sitting alone in a café, staring blankly ahead, his hands trembling around a cup of untouched coffee.

That was when he understood the final, most **terrible** truth.

**What if the world isn’t hypocritical?**

**What if hypocrisy is just… life?**

What if no one is lying?What if everyone is just **doing what they have to, to survive?**

What if honesty and deception are **not opposites**—but **partners**, intertwined like breath and lungs, each meaningless without the other?

What if **this sickness, this contradiction, this unbearable stench of human nature—was not a flaw, but the very thing that kept the world turning?**

Jonas exhaled.

And the coffee in his hands **suddenly smelled like ashes.**

Like something burned away.

Like the last hope of a man **who had finally accepted the horror of the world.**

# 6.The Scent of Clarity

They found Jonas two days later.

Not dead.

Just **empty.**

His apartment **untouched**, his belongings neatly in place, nothing to suggest anything had gone wrong—except for one detail.

**The entire place reeked.**

Not just his apartment.

The **hallway.** The **stairwell.** The **air around him.**

A smell so thick, **neighbors gagged as they walked past his door.**

They described it in different ways—**rotting flowers, decayed fruit, a landfill on a summer day.**

But Jonas, sitting in his chair, his hands resting in his lap, **knew exactly what it was.**

**It was the smell of understanding.**

And it was unbearable.

The coffee in his hands had long gone cold, but he didn’t care. **Because he could smell it now.**

Not just lies.Not just people.**Everything.**

And it was… *beautiful.*

A slow, sharp smile stretched across his face.

This wasn’t despair.This wasn’t surrender.

This was **clarity.**

For the first time in his life, Jonas wasn’t drowning in the weight of hypocrisy.

He was **above it.**

The world wasn’t sick. **It was working exactly as intended.**

Truth wasn’t better than lies.Lies weren’t worse than truth.

They were **one and the same.**

**This whole time, he had been suffering for nothing.**

Because he had been trying to **play by the wrong rules.**

# 7. The Egoist Awakens

A strange calm settled over him.

For years, Jonas had believed he was cursed—**that he was different.** That the world was broken, that people were disgusting, that he was **some tragic anomaly, forced to perceive what no one else could.**

But now, he saw the truth.

He wasn’t the anomaly. **They were.**

They were **fumbling in the dark, lying to themselves, drowning in contradictions they refused to acknowledge.**

Jonas? **He was free now.**

And *they*—the world, the people around him, the ones who didn’t understand—**they were beneath him.**

The thought slithered into his mind, wrapping itself around his ribs like a second spine.

He didn’t flinch at the realization.Didn’t reject it.

Instead, he **breathed it in.**

And for the first time in his life—

**it didn’t smell bad at all.**

# 8. The Change

His body felt lighter.

Not in the sense that a burden had been lifted—no, the weight was still there.

But now, he carried it differently.

Not as a victim.Not as a man drowning in disgust.

But as **something else entirely.**

Jonas Reeve **had spent years suffering.**

**Now?**

He was done suffering.

Now, he would **see how far this new understanding could take him.**

# 9. The Predator Walks

Jonas stood, stretching his limbs like an animal waking from hibernation.

The world smelled **different now.**

The stench of lies? The filth of human contradiction?

It didn’t repulse him anymore.

It was **his playground.**

He stepped out onto the street, breathing deeply, letting it all **wash over him.**

The man outside the café, telling a friend he was “doing great” while reeking of failure and debt?

Jonas smirked. **Weak.**

The woman on the phone, promising to call back when she never would?

Jonas chuckled. **Transparent.**

The businessman in a suit, smiling, shaking hands, masking his stench of corruption with expensive cologne?

Jonas smiled.

**Perfect.**

# 10. The Lion Has Tasted Blood

For years, Jonas thought hypocrisy was **the great sickness of mankind.**

But no.

It was **the great currency.**

And now, **he knew how to spend it.**

# Epilogue: The Final Stench

Jonas was not broken anymore.

Jonas was **not suffering anymore.**

He had **crossed the threshold.**

He had seen **the deepest, ugliest parts of human nature—**

And he was **finally okay with it.**

Because now, **he knew how to use it.**

And the world—**so full of lies, so full of weakness, so full of people pretending they understood their own lives**—

**The world had no idea what it had just unleashed.**

Jonas Reeve had spent his whole life **drowning in the truth.**

Now?

**He would make it work for him.**

And as he walked down the street, blending into the crowd, breathing in the **symphony of deception,**

**Jonas smiled.**

**Because now, he smelled exactly like them.**

**2) Warning: I haven't figured out the rules of reddit yet, so if I need to attach a link, I hope I can do it in the comments, without waiting for the post to be deleted by moderators or reddit filters (links to manga, various interviews and blogs**).

Yes, another post on this topic, perhaps you are already tired of listening to the same reasoning on the same topic, but in any case, let's discuss this aspect of the ending, but from both sides. If you did not know, Isayama was inspired by many works throughout the writing of the manga, in this post we will touch only on the manga called Himeanole. But unlike similar articles on this topic, for the first time in this topic we touch not only on the manga, but also on the film adaptation of this manga, filmed in 2016, and its features.

**Part 1 What is ""Himeanole""?**

Himeanoles can be divided into two parts, depending on which of the main characters is responsible for the actual plot of the chapter. One of them is an ordinary guy named Okida, he is kind of a shy person, he does not have many friends and does not have a girlfriend. This changes when he goes to a local coffee shop where he meets a woman named Yuki, who later becomes his girlfriend. There are various comedic and awkward moments in this part, most of which will belong to the secondary characters (Ando, ​​Okada's teacher friend), but for us, the important one is the second main character, whose name is **Morita**.

Morita is not normal. He is almost a psychopath. In fact, he has killed in the past and is prone to do so again (he killed a bully who bullied him in collaboration with his classmate). He also asks the classmate **(Wagusi)** with whom he killed the bully to send him money on a regular basis, while not working for 7 years and spending the money on a pachinko machine. But still, his storyline starts, oddly enough, as a minor character whose goal is to help his ""friend"" kill a man for money (an insurance scam), unfortunately, the plan fails and the ""friend"" plans to escape because he is afraid of being arrested, but suddenly something unexpected happens and Morito just kills him.

Later, he calls his ""friend"" Wagusi (a classmate who helped him kill a bully from school) from whom he extorts money and asks him to help him with the body of the murdered man (he doesn't know about the murders), which leads to this dialogue.

[Talk-1](https://preview.redd.it/sq2m4vpuxbje1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=1738b896da1312a8f069f5b5494acdc69020faf3)

[Talk-2](https://preview.redd.it/8cqwhi5yxbje1.png?width=1088&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3d0f829c6bf16aadf071949a1f2ccb014a727d)

And yes, he doesn't seem to feel any self-loathing or pity for other people, he also directly states his main goal (to kill Yuki and torture her) several times throughout the manga and his number one goal never changes. Later on, the plot switches from killing Yuki to killing Okade when Morito finds out that they are dating and that Okade can become a ""threat"" (my understanding) and tries to get rid of him, he even hires a homeless man who has a driver's license to help him if Wagusi can't (while lying that he wants to teach Okade a lesson as a bad person who insults his ""girlfriend"" Yuki). However, this event becomes the last straw for Wagusi, he plans to turn himself in to the police to stop Morito and his future murders, but his girlfriend suggests to just kill him and he agrees to it, unfortunately, the plan fails and they die at the hands of Morito.

Now Morito uses a homeless man to dispose of the bodies (while threatening him that if he doesn't help, he'll kill him) and burns down his house to delay the police in their investigation of missing people (people die as a result of the arson). After this, several more bad things happen to him (the murder of a woman with cancer who sheltered him, the murder of a policeman after which Morito gets a weapon, the murder of Yuki's neighbor in an attempt to carry out his plan, as well as the man who investigated his case and warned Okada, causing Yuki and Okada to flee the city). In the end, in an attempt to achieve his goals, he killed 7 people and lost everything he had, but never got to Yuki, for the first time he starts thinking about himself and others, and ends up in the hands of the police (knowing that he faces the death penalty).

**Part 2. Those Were Not Human Eyes.**

Honestly, there's a lot to say about the adaptation, but we'll focus on the last 20 minutes of this movie, where things happen that weren't in the manga, and the first thing we'll touch on is the dialogue between Yuki and Okade in the hospital after Ando meets Morita (a completely original scene).

[Conversation in the hospital-1](https://preview.redd.it/y5dei8o2ybje1.png?width=763&format=png&auto=webp&s=f53bd4bc3f7f2c8c58837aae32cd88810e25db2f)

And you got it right, in the 2016 movie we have a different Morito, unlike the original, where it is often said that he was like this from birth, in the movie he is just an ordinary guy who was broken and succumbed to the ""darkness of man"" and started killing. What is even more remarkable is the changed dynamics of the relationship between Okade and Morita, because in the movie they are more like friends than in the manga (**in the original they only had one dialogue at the beginning, and in the movie there are as many as 4**), although you can say that all these dialogues were added only for the sake of the ""final battle"" between school friends.

[Completely original scenes \(rescue Yuki and capture Morito\)](https://preview.redd.it/wzjwh9i9ybje1.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b0e7bb1d26c80cfaddbf649a77a599220020179)

[The ending of the film](https://preview.redd.it/df50r90dybje1.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f0900f9e1e88d9a8c574482a0153f421c68852)

**Part 3 Eren and the Problems of an Idea**

So now we know that Isayama's idea of ​​someone being ""born the way they are"" seems to mostly come from Himeanole, where Morita was never able to become a normal person who could live in society and knew there was always something wrong with him (except for the 2016 movie). Isayama hinted at this idea for Eren at various points in the story, most famously Chapter **121**.

[This implies that there was always something \\""off\\"" about Eren.](https://preview.redd.it/i3mqfkxmybje1.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b651abfac4aad6f1e1b4e36369eba4fe118078d)

On its own, if you don't take 131 and 139 into account, this is just Eren stating that he would always fight for freedom and that he doesn't hesitate to be violent towards those who tried to rob him of his freedom. Pretty much in line with how most viewed Eren anyway, yes?

A guy who is naturally violent when it comes to his pursuit of freedom but also empathetic enough to care about those around him.

That would be the case, right? Sadly not. And here is where the influence of Himeanole arrives.

In Himeanole, the serial killer was severely bullied as a teenager, but also claims (by himself) that he was born ""different"" (but not in the 2016 film, this plot point is cut).

So what does this have to do with Eren?

He wished for it. He wanted it to happen.

In other words, 131 paints Eren as if he wanted to create the Rumble because he wanted to see the very world that was presented to him in Armina's book: In conclusion: Eren was born with a twisted desire for freedom, that freedom = flat earth (yes, as stupid as that may sound), and because of that, he committed the Rumble. He just wanted a clean surface and wanted to kill humanity because they were in his way.

The Himeanole check here is great. Morita, like Eren, wasn't born ""normal"" and he also had a sick and twisted desire. For his desires, it was to get pleasure by killing people. For Erena, it's a flat world that he wants to have and the only way to achieve that is to kill everyone.

https://preview.redd.it/ovgo99eqybje1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=122871baae2dfca43ed717b4d6a6ac7bf544ea33

So why doesn't it just work!!!

The difference between Himeanole and Attack on Titan is that the author of Himeanol portrayed Morita as a villain after his first kill. While you can feel sorry for him, it's hard to ever sympathize with him when you know he's doing it simply because he's an evil pervert who gets pleasure from these people.

Meanwhile, in Attack on Titan, Isayama wrote a ton of reasons why someone should root for Eren. Hell, we see Eren's mother get eaten (reveals he did it, thanks to 139 for that), which would make just about anyone angry. We see him become more calm and rational in Brawl, we see him get genuinely upset at what his father did. We also see Eren even give up his own life to save humanity in the Historia cave.

That doesn't fit a character who apparently just wants to flatten everything because of a random book. Hell, even Eren himself said that he FORGOT the dream he shared with Armin in Chapter 84.

https://preview.redd.it/dc275aytybje1.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=747f4da10366dd17beec4eb3d9ecac27b8518d81

131 wants to tell us that ever since he was a child, Eren has been inclined to see the Earth as flat and devoid of people, and yet in Chapter 84, Eren says that he has long forgotten about that dream and that it has been replaced by a desire for revenge.

He wasn't interested in the sea, he was interested in seeing these things without being bound by any restrictions.

But then the number 131 comes up, implying that ""**seeing this scenery**"" was what Eren had wanted all along, ever since he was a child. There's a reason why these two panels use the image of Eren as a child.

https://preview.redd.it/zglkk3dxybje1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee53a5b905aa04bf4e100649cabb0f792223cedd

Suddenly, what he wants to achieve isn't the freedom he would get from killing his enemies, not recognizing the freedom of whatever he wants to think, but the view itself.

The implication is disturbing. In fact, even if the outside world was completely peaceful, Eren would still have caused the Rumble because he was disappointed that humanity even exists outside the walls (**131**).

https://preview.redd.it/aiv1bh32zbje1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9050a666738ecf1f33048c756ff8bd8d686983

So Eren wanted to do the Rumbling because he wanted a flattened world, he states so in 139, he states in 131 that he was disappointed that humanity still existed and that he wanted to wipe it all out. He also states that this is primarily because the world wasn't like the one in Armin's book.

But how does this fit with the same guy who himself previously stated that he forgot about this dream? How could something that Armina's book told him be taken to make him want to destroy the world?

Isayama couldn't answer any of these questions. He took only one part of Morito's character and ignored all the others or replaced them with something that was never part of his character. Morito is honest with himself, he knows what he wants and what he will do (get rid of any threat that could stop him from catching Yuki) for his dream, in the movies he almost achieved this goal, and we see what could have happened to Yuki. Morito deceived and killed people without having to pretend or justify his actions with heroic goals (not much effort in the movie) because most of the time he killed without remorse for his dream, **this is how he was from the beginning to the penultimate chapter**.

And what's funny is that when his conscience woke up and asked about the dead, he again thought only about himself.

So yeah, Eren's character becomes messy because Isayama got too inspired by a work that was created too late and implemented it in a bad and rushed manner, which hardly makes any sense.

**TL;DR**

**The ending was messy and confusing, Isayama shouldn't have tried to force the ""born this way"" theme that he read about in Himeanole and also add new features that were not typical of the original and contradicted.**

**P.S.**

**Although it's also worth noting that the work ""Himeanole"" is surrounded by strange facts and if you know these facts, you can ask very strange questions.**",6,1739637461.0,titanfolk,2,1.0,False

Joshua exchanged polite goodbyes with the studio staff, his mind already on Jess. He was actually excited to see her. He still loved her, even if things had been strained lately. He clung to the hope that they could recapture the spark they once shared. He exited the studio and spotted her car, a sleek, black SUV, parked a little further down the street than usual. He walked towards it, a knot tightening in his stomach. Something felt off. He couldn't place it, but it was there. Jess was inside, slumped against the headrest, her eyes closed. She didn't acknowledge him as he got in.

""Hey,"" he said, leaning in for a kiss. Jess turned her head slightly, offering a perfunctory peck on the cheek. ""Long day?""

""You could say that,"" she replied, her voice flat.

The drive home was silent, an uncomfortable silence that stretched on and on. Joshua kept glancing at Jess, trying to decipher the shift in her demeanor. She seemed distant, preoccupied. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore.

""Jess, what's wrong?""

She sighed, a long, drawn-out sigh. ""Joshua,"" she began, her voice trembling slightly, ""I don't think this is working anymore.""

His heart pounded in his chest. ""What are you talking about?""

""I'm not happy,"" she said, her eyes welling up with tears. ""I haven't been happy for a long time.""

He felt a surge of anger, mixed with a deep, aching sadness. ""Is this about my job? Because you know I do this for us.""

""It's not just your job, Joshua. It's… it's everything. We're not the same people we were when we got married.""

""So, what, you're just giving up? After all this time?""

Jess took a deep breath. ""I've been seeing someone else,"" she confessed, her voice barely a whisper.

The world seemed to tilt on its axis. ""Seeing someone else?"" he repeated, the words hollow. ""You asked for an open relationship, remember? I said no.""

""That was different,"" she retorted, her voice rising. ""That was about *you* wanting to sleep with other people. This is about… about connection. Something I don't feel with you anymore.""

He stared at her, speechless. The anger was gone now, replaced by a crushing wave of despair. ""So, that's it? You're just… leaving?""

Jess nodded, tears streaming down her face. ""I'm moving out,"" she said. ""I've already found a place.""

Joshua watched as Jess pulled out of the driveway, the taillights of her SUV disappearing into the night. He sat there for a long time, the silence broken only by the sound of his own ragged breathing. The knot in his stomach had unraveled, leaving a gaping hole in its place. He felt empty, hollowed out. He couldn't bring himself to move. He just sat there, in the darkness, as the weight of his broken marriage crashed down on him.

The house was silent, suffocatingly so. Joshua wandered through the rooms, each one a testament to a life now shattered. He sank onto the living room couch, the cushions still bearing the faint imprint of Jess's body. He fumbled for his cigarettes, the familiar ritual a small comfort in this unfamiliar territory. He lit one, the cherry glowing in the dim light, and inhaled deeply. Music drifted from the speakers, a playlist he and Jess used to enjoy. Now, each note was a sharp pang of loss, a reminder of shared moments now tainted with bitterness.

He needed to talk, to hear a voice other than the ones echoing in his head. He scrolled through his contacts, his finger hovering over Tristan's name. Tristan, his old college buddy, the life of the party, always ready with a joke and a listening ear. He hadn't spoken to him in years, caught up in the whirlwind of his career and his marriage. He hesitated, a wave of self-pity washing over him. Who was he to burden Tristan with his problems? But the silence was unbearable, a crushing weight on his chest. He pressed the call button.

""Josh! It's been years, man! Holy smokes, bro!"" Tristan's voice boomed through the speaker, a blast of unexpected cheerfulness. Joshua felt a flicker of warmth, a momentary reprieve from the darkness.

""Hey, Tristan,"" he mumbled, his voice thick with emotion.

They exchanged pleasantries, catching up on years of missed moments. Tristan, ever the optimist, painted a picture of his life, filled with adventures and successes. Joshua listened, a hollow ache in his chest. He couldn't muster the energy to reciprocate, to pretend that his world wasn't crumbling around him.

""So,"" Tristan said, his voice dropping slightly, ""how's Jess?""

The question was like a punch to the gut. ""She's gone,"" Joshua said, the words catching in his throat.

""Gone? What do you mean?""

""She left. Said she wasn't happy. Found someone else.""

A stunned silence followed. Then, Tristan's voice, filled with concern, ""Josh, I'm so sorry, man. But you know what? Screw her. She doesn't deserve you.""

""I guess I wasn't good enough,"" Joshua said, the words heavy with self-blame. He started to analyze their relationship, seeing it through Jess's eyes. He saw his own shortcomings, his preoccupation with work, his inability to truly see her needs. He saw the resentment building, the spark fading. He saw his own role in their demise.

""Don't you dare blame yourself,"" Tristan interrupted, his voice firm. ""You're a good man, Josh. Loyal, hardworking, kind. She's the one who threw it all away.""

""But maybe she was right,"" Joshua argued, his voice cracking. ""Maybe I wasn't what she needed. Maybe I was too focused on my career, on providing for us, that I forgot about… about us.""

""Listen,"" Tristan said, his voice softening, ""you can't blame yourself for her choices. You gave her a good life, you were faithful, you loved her. Sometimes, people just… drift apart. It doesn't mean you're not worthy of love, Josh. It just means you haven't found the right person yet.""

Joshua closed his eyes, the image of Jess's tear-stained face flashing before him. He felt a surge of anger, a bitter taste in his mouth. But underneath it all, there was a deeper pain, a sense of loss that threatened to consume him.

""I don't know what to do,"" he whispered, his voice raw with emotion.

""Just breathe, man,"" Tristan said. ""Take it one day at a time. Lean on your friends, let us be there for you. And remember, you deserve to be happy. Don't let her take that away from you.""

Joshua hung up the phone, Tristan's words echoing in his mind. He took another drag of his cigarette, the smoke swirling around him like the chaotic thoughts in his head. He was lost, adrift in a sea of despair. But somewhere deep down, a tiny ember of hope flickered. Maybe Tristan was right. Maybe this wasn't the end. Maybe it was just the beginning of something new.

Tristan's words were a lifeline, a reminder of a time when life was simpler, wilder, and filled with the reckless abandon of youth. They'd been inseparable since grade school, partners in crime, always pushing the boundaries and testing the limits. Their teenage years were a blur of legendary parties, impromptu road trips, and close calls that still made them laugh, even years later.

There was the time they'd ""borrowed"" Tristan's older brother's car for a joyride, ending up stranded in a cornfield after a failed attempt to jump a ditch. Or the infamous New Year's Eve party where they'd rigged the sprinkler system to spray champagne, resulting in a chaotic, bubbly free-for-all. And who could forget the ill-fated camping trip where they'd accidentally set fire to their tent while attempting to cook a gourmet meal over an open flame?

They'd shared it all, the triumphs and the mishaps, the laughter and the tears. They were more than just friends; they were brothers, bound by a shared history and an unspoken understanding.

But as they grew older, their paths diverged. Joshua found stability in his marriage and his career, while Tristan continued to embrace the unpredictable, chasing adventure and pushing the boundaries of convention. Joshua had watched from afar, a mixture of admiration and trepidation. He envied Tristan's freedom, his carefree spirit, but he also feared it. He'd seen firsthand the dark side of recklessness, the potential for self-destruction that lurked beneath the surface.

He'd had his own brushes with excess, experimenting with drugs and alcohol in his younger years. He'd managed to pull back from the brink, finding solace in Jess and his photography. But the memories lingered, a shadow of doubt that haunted him. He worried that reconnecting with Tristan would reawaken those dormant demons, that he would be pulled back into a world he'd worked so hard to escape.

He knew he needed Tristan's support now, more than ever. But he also knew the risks. He was walking a tightrope, balancing his need for connection with his fear of losing everything he'd built.

Joshua stared at the ceiling, the shadows dancing in the dim light. He couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness, the hollowness that Jess had left behind. He needed to get out of the house, to escape the memories that clung to every corner. He picked up his phone and dialed Tristan's number.

""Hey, you busy?"" Joshua asked, his voice still heavy with sadness.

""Nah, just chilling,"" Tristan replied. ""What's up?""

""I need to get out of here,"" Joshua said. ""Want to grab a drink?""

""Absolutely,"" Tristan said. ""I know just the place. It's got great music, cheap drinks, and plenty of… distractions.""

They met at the bar, a dimly lit, lively spot with a mix of music and chatter filling the air. Tristan, ever the extrovert, was already working the room, charming the bartender and making friends with a group of women at the next table. Joshua, still feeling the weight of his recent heartbreak, was more reserved, observing the scene with a mix of amusement and apprehension.

As the night wore on, the alcohol flowed, the music pulsed, and the conversation grew louder. Tristan, fueled by his usual exuberance and a few too many shots, was in his element, regaling the women with outlandish stories and hilarious impersonations. Joshua, despite his initial reluctance, found himself drawn into the energy of the room, laughing at Tristan's antics and enjoying the company of the women.

At one point, Tristan, in a moment of playful mischief, challenged Joshua to a dance-off. Joshua, surprised by the sudden challenge, hesitated for a moment before accepting, a grin spreading across his face. They took to the dance floor, two friends letting loose, their bodies moving to the rhythm of the music, their laughter echoing through the bar.

The night was a blur of music, laughter, and conversation. As the bar began to empty, Joshua and Tristan found themselves chatting with two women, their conversation flowing easily, their connection growing stronger. The women were witty, intelligent, and just as fun-loving as Joshua and Tristan.

The laughter faded, the music died down, and the warmth of the bar gave way to the cold, harsh light of reality. Joshua had sought solace, a brief respite from the pain, but the world wasn't done with him. The whispers started again, louder now, more insistent, weaving their way into his thoughts, twisting his memories, reshaping his very being. He hadn't expected the world to turn against him, to conspire to break him down, to mold him into something unrecognizable, something no human could fathom. He didn't know it yet, but the transformation had begun. The cracks were widening, the darkness seeping in, and Joshua Carpenter was slowly becoming a monster.

The silence was a suffocating blanket, broken only by the frantic thump-thump-thump of Joshua's heart against his ribs. He lay rigid in bed, eyes wide, staring into the oppressive darkness. It wasn't the absence of sound that chilled him, it was the *presence* of something else, something just beyond the threshold of hearing. Then, a whisper, like a breath against his ear, slithered into his consciousness. *Joshua…* it hissed, a distorted, malicious echo of his own name. He was alone, utterly alone, yet the feeling of being watched, scrutinized, judged, was visceral, suffocating. He wasn't sure if he was hearing it or feeling it, but the whispers were there, weaving themselves into the fabric of his sanity.

He bolted upright, heart hammering against his ribs, and stumbled towards the bathroom. The fluorescent light flickered to life, casting a sickly glow on his reflection. He stared at his own image, searching for something, anything, that would explain the gnawing unease that had taken root in his soul. His eyes seemed darker, more hollow, and a faint tremor twitched at the corner of his mouth. A new mark, like a faint bruise, marred his arm, but it was gone in the next instant, or so he thought. He felt a creeping dread, the sense of something unseen, something monstrous, growing inside of him.

He stumbled back to bed, sleep now a distant memory. He closed his eyes, and a kaleidoscope of disturbing images flashed behind his eyelids. He was trapped in a labyrinth of whispers, pursued by shadowy figures with accusing eyes. They hurled accusations at him, each word a poisoned dart piercing his flesh. His skin crawled, his body felt heavy, distorted, like it was no longer his own. He woke with a gasp, drenched in a cold sweat, the lingering terror of the dream clinging to him like a shroud. The whispers followed him into wakefulness, their voices growing louder, more insistent, weaving their way into his thoughts, twisting his memories, reshaping his very being.

He stumbled out of bed, driven by a desperate need to escape the whispers, to find some semblance of sanity. He wandered through the silent house, each room a stark reminder of what he had lost. He paused in the living room, drawn to a framed photo of Jess, her smiling face a cruel mockery of his present misery. He picked it up, his fingers tracing the outline of her face, a wave of longing crashing over him. Then, he saw it. A flicker of something in her eyes, a hint of malice that he had never noticed before. He blinked, and it was gone, but the seed of doubt had been planted. Had she always been this way? Had he been blind to the darkness lurking beneath the surface?

As he stood there, lost in a labyrinth of doubt and fear, a chill ran down his spine. He wasn't sure if it was the coldness of the room or something else, something far more sinister. He felt a presence, a malevolent force closing in on him, whispering promises of power and revenge.  The whispers had found their host.

The whispers became a chorus, a cacophony of voices swirling inside his head, each one a shard of doubt, fear, and accusation. They clawed at his sanity, tearing at the fragile fabric of his reality. He clutched his head, trying to silence the voices, but they only grew louder, more insistent.

""Shut up! Shut up! SHUT UP!"" he screamed, his voice raw with desperation.

The photo of Jess slipped from his grasp, shattering against the hardwood floor. He sank to his knees, the broken glass a mirror reflecting his own fractured state.

""Jess!"" he cried, his voice breaking. ""Why? Why did you leave me?""

He lashed out, his fists pounding against the floor, the walls, the furniture. He overturned a coffee table, sending books and magazines scattering across the room. He ripped the curtains from the windows, letting the cold night air flood in. He grabbed a lamp and hurled it against the wall, the shattering glass echoing his own internal chaos.

He was spiraling, losing control, consumed by a grief so profound it threatened to swallow him whole. He sobbed uncontrollably, his body wracked with tremors. He crawled across the floor, the broken glass cutting into his skin, a physical manifestation of his emotional pain. He reached the hallway mirror and slammed his fist against it, the glass cracking and splintering. He saw his reflection, distorted and grotesque, a stranger staring back at him with wild, desperate eyes.

""Why!?"" he screamed at his reflection, his voice cracking with anguish. ""Why did you leave me!?""

Suddenly, a sharp knock on the door startled him. He froze, his breath catching in his throat. The knocking grew louder, more insistent. He stumbled to his feet, his body trembling, his mind racing. He cautiously approached the door, his heart pounding in his chest.

""Who is it?"" he croaked, his voice barely a whisper.

""Police,"" a gruff voice responded. ""Open up.""

He fumbled with the lock, his hands shaking. He opened the door a crack, his eyes widening in surprise. Two uniformed officers stood on his porch, their expressions a mixture of concern and suspicion.

""We received a noise complaint,"" one of the officers said. ""Someone reported hearing screaming.""

Joshua stared at them, his mind reeling. ""Screaming?"" he repeated, his voice hoarse.

""Yes,"" the other officer said, his eyes narrowing. ""A woman screaming.""

Joshua's blood ran cold. ""A woman?"" he whispered, his voice barely audible.

The officers exchanged a look. ""That's right,"" the first officer said. ""Are you alone here, sir?""

Joshua nodded slowly, his mind racing. He couldn't comprehend what they were saying. He had been screaming, yes, but he was a man. He looked down at his hands, his body, searching for an explanation, a sign of the transformation he was undergoing.

""Sir, are you alright?"" the second officer asked, his voice laced with concern.

Joshua looked up at them, his eyes wide with fear and confusion. ""I don't know,"" he whispered, his voice trembling. ""I don't know what's happening to me.""

""Sir, we need to come in and make sure everything is alright,"" the first officer insisted, his hand hovering near his taser. ""It's standard procedure.""

Joshua, still reeling from the revelation about the woman's screams, felt a surge of defiance. ""Don't you need a warrant for that?"" he mumbled, the words tasting like ash in his mouth.

The second officer stepped closer, his gaze unwavering. ""Look, sir, we're just trying to do our job. If you have nothing to hide, you'll let us in.""

He knew they didn't trust him, saw him as a potential threat. The accusation hung heavy in the air, a woman screaming, a woman he hadn't even been with. He felt a surge of anger, a primal urge to lash out, to defend himself against this invisible accuser. But the exhaustion, the emotional turmoil, had drained him. He simply nodded, stepping aside to let them in.

""Wait out here,"" the first officer instructed, gesturing towards the porch. ""Have a cigarette or something.""

Joshua numbly obeyed, lighting another cigarette with trembling hands. He watched as the officers disappeared into his house, their flashlights cutting through the darkness. He felt a strange detachment, like he was watching a scene unfold in a movie, a scene in which he was both the protagonist and the villain. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the world was tilting on its axis, and he was powerless to stop it.

The officers emerged a few minutes later, their faces grim. ""Everything seems to be in order, sir,"" the first officer said, his voice laced with suspicion. ""But we'll be keeping an eye on this place.""

They left, their cruiser's taillights disappearing into the night. Joshua stood on the porch, the cigarette burning a hole in his fingers. He felt a strange mix of relief and dread. Relief that the immediate confrontation was over, dread at the implications of the officers' words, the lingering suspicion in their eyes. And the woman's screams... who had screamed? He hadn't been with anyone. Tristan had, but he was already home, wasn't he?

He went back inside, the silence now amplified by the echo of the officers' footsteps. He began to clean up the mess, the shattered glass, the overturned furniture, the remnants of his breakdown. He turned on the TV, the mindless chatter a distraction from the turmoil in his mind. He flipped through the channels, landing on the local news. A headline flashed across the screen: ""Two Women Missing After Night Out.""

His heart skipped a beat. He turned up the volume, his eyes glued to the screen. The news anchor, her voice somber, reported that two women had been reported missing after a night out at a local bar. They had been seen with two men, but their identities were unknown. The police were asking for anyone with information to come forward.

Joshua's blood ran cold. He recognized the bar, the one he and Tristan had been at. He remembered the two women, their laughter, their easy conversation. He fumbled for his phone, his hands shaking. He dialed Tristan's number, the ringing tone echoing in the silence. It went straight to voicemail. He tried again, and again, but there was no answer. Panic clawed at his throat, a cold dread seeping into his bones. He was caught in a nightmare, a horrifying reality that was rapidly spiraling out of control.

The news report replayed in Joshua’s mind, the faces of the missing women flashing before his eyes. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was connected to it somehow, that the night at the bar had unleashed something dark and terrible within him. He felt a strange unease in his gut, a twisting sensation that was more than just anxiety. He dismissed it as stress, the lingering effects of the breakup, the police, the news. But the feeling persisted, growing stronger, more insistent.

He went to the bathroom, hoping a cold shower would clear his head. As he undressed, he caught his reflection in the mirror. His skin seemed… different. A faint discoloration, like a bruise spreading across his abdomen. He touched it gingerly, and a sharp pain shot through him. It wasn’t just a bruise. It was something… else.

He leaned closer, his breath catching in his throat. The discoloration was spreading, a sickly purple hue creeping across his skin. And beneath the surface, something was moving. A slow, undulating movement, like something was trying to push its way out. He pressed harder, his fingers sinking into the soft flesh of his stomach. The pain was excruciating, a searing heat that made him gasp.

Suddenly, a memory surfaced, unbidden, from the depths of his past. He was a child, watching in horror as his mother clutched her stomach, her face contorted in agony. The same sickening purple bruising, the same unnatural swelling. Prolapsed stomach, the doctor had called it. He remembered the fear, the confusion, the image of his mother being rushed away in an ambulance. And then, the silence.

He stumbled back from the mirror, his heart pounding in his chest. He felt a wave of nausea, a primal fear gripping him. This wasn’t just a bad dream. This was real. The transformation was happening.

Then, a voice, cold and sharp, echoed in his mind. “He threw me down the stairs.”

The memory intensified, flooding his senses. He saw his mother again, falling, her body crashing against the hard floor. He heard her screams, her cries for help. And then, another voice, a child’s wail, filled with terror and pain. “He killed our baby!”

The pain in his stomach intensified, a searing, tearing sensation. He doubled over, clutching his abdomen, his body convulsing. He collapsed to the floor, the whispers and cries swirling around him, a chorus of torment echoing in his mind. He was changing, becoming something monstrous, something he didn’t recognize. And the voices, the memories, were just the beginning.

The pain was beyond anything Joshua had ever imagined. It felt like something was alive inside him, a parasitic entity writhing and gnawing its way up his body, tearing through muscle and sinew. He tried to scream, but his voice was trapped, choked by the terror and the agony. He felt his body contorting, his muscles spasming violently, his bones audibly cracking and shifting. He was a prisoner in his own flesh, forced to endure this horrific metamorphosis, his consciousness a front-row seat to his own gruesome undoing.

The pressure built, a crushing, sickening force that threatened to rupture him from the inside out. He could feel something moving, slick and wet, slithering upwards like a serpent. Then, it happened. Something burst forth, not from his stomach as he expected, but from his mouth. It wasn't a scream, not a human sound. It was something guttural, demonic, a screech that tore through the silence of the house, a sound that could curdle blood and freeze the heart. It was the sound of something inhuman being violently birthed, a raw, visceral expulsion of something utterly alien. He tasted blood and bile, the coppery tang of his own terror.

And then, mercifully, everything went black.  

He surfaced from the blackness, gasping for air, his body slick with sweat and something else… something viscous and metallic. He was in a nightmare, a swirling vortex of whispers and accusations. Tristan’s voice, usually a source of comfort, echoed through the darkness, twisted and malicious. “Josh? Man, that guy’s a total creep. Remember that time he…?” The lies were outlandish, absurd, yet they burrowed into Joshua’s mind, planting seeds of doubt and self-loathing. Then, Jess’s voice, cold and distant, joined the chorus. “He’s always been weird. I heard he…”. The rumors were more personal, more intimate, laced with betrayal. They painted him as a monster, a predator, a man capable of unspeakable acts. He couldn’t see them, Tristan and Jess, but their voices were omnipresent, a suffocating blanket of lies.

He fought to open his eyes, to escape the torment of their voices. Finally, his eyelids flickered open. He wasn't in his bed. He wasn't even in his house. He was in a room bathed in a sickening red light, the source of which he couldn't discern. The air was thick with a cloying, coppery smell that made his stomach churn. He looked down at his hands. They were covered in blood, not his own, he instinctively knew. He was naked, his body smeared with the same crimson substance.

His gaze drifted upwards, and his blood ran cold. Two figures stood before him, their forms silhouetted against the red glow. He recognized them. The women from the bar. They were… different. Their eyes were wide and vacant, dead white orbs that stared straight through him, yet somehow also seemed to see into the deepest, darkest corners of his soul. Their smiles were fixed, unnatural, a grotesque parody of human expression.

His stomach lurched. He looked lower, and a wave of nausea washed over him. Their abdomens had been crudely opened, the flesh ripped apart. Their wombs were empty, scooped clean. The organs, glistening and grotesque, lay scattered on the floor between them, a horrifying tableau of carnage. Yet, they did nothing. They simply stood there, smiling, their dead eyes locked on his, as if they were waiting for him to do something, to complete some unspeakable ritual. He was trapped in a tableau of horror, a scene so grotesque, so utterly inhuman, that his mind struggled to process it. The whispers intensified, now laced with triumph, as if they had orchestrated this nightmare, as if they had created this monster he had become.

The red room swam before his eyes, the grotesque tableau of the two women seared into his mind. He was trapped, paralyzed by a terror so profound it transcended fear. He tried to scream, but no sound escaped his throat. He tried to move, but his limbs were heavy, unresponsive. He was a prisoner in his own body, forced to witness this horrific spectacle.

Suddenly, a blinding flash of light pierced the darkness, snapping him back to reality. He blinked, his eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden brightness. He was in his bed, the familiar surroundings a stark contrast to the nightmarish scene he had just witnessed. The red room, the mutilated bodies, the dead white eyes – all gone, vanished like a phantom.

He was drenched in sweat, his heart pounding in his chest. He sat up, his body trembling, his mind reeling from the horror of the dream. He looked around the room, half expecting to see the two women standing there, their grotesque smiles mocking him. But there was nothing, only the familiar furniture, the soft glow of the bedside lamp.

He reached for his phone, his hand shaking. He saw several missed calls from Tristan. He quickly dialed the number, his heart pounding with a mixture of hope and dread.

""Tristan?"" he said, his voice hoarse.

""Josh? Dude, what's up? I tried calling you back earlier, but you didn't answer.""

""I was… I had a nightmare,"" Joshua said, his voice trembling. ""It was… horrible.""

""Whoa, easy there, man,"" Tristan said, his voice laced with concern. ""You alright?""

""I don't know,"" Joshua said, his voice cracking. ""I think… I think something's happening to me.""

""What do you mean?"" Tristan asked.

""I don't know,"" Joshua repeated, his mind racing. ""I had this dream, this horrible dream. And… and I think it was real.""

""Josh, it was just a dream,"" Tristan said, his voice soothing. ""You're just stressed out, man. It's been a rough couple of days.""

""No, it wasn't just a dream,"" Joshua insisted. ""I felt it, Tristan. I felt it happening to me.""

""Felt what happening?"" Tristan asked, his voice laced with confusion.

Joshua hesitated, unsure how to explain the horror he had experienced. ""I… I don't know,"" he stammered. ""I can't explain it.""

""Just take it easy, man,"" Tristan said. ""Get some rest. We'll talk about it tomorrow.""

""Yeah, alright,"" Joshua said, his voice barely a whisper.

He hung up the phone, his mind still reeling from the nightmare. He couldn't shake the feeling that it was more than just a dream, that it was a premonition, a glimpse into the dark transformation that was taking place within him. He was changing, becoming something monstrous, something he didn't recognize. And he was terrified.

The lingering dread of the nightmare clung to Joshua like a shroud. He woke up feeling exhausted, his body heavy, his mind clouded with disturbing images. He knew he couldn't go to work, not in this state. He needed time to process what had happened, to understand the strange transformation he was undergoing. He called his boss, Mr. Thompson, hoping to take a sick day.

""Thompson, it's Joshua,"" he said, his voice hoarse. ""I'm not feeling well. I don't think I can come in today.""

""Carpenter, this is really bad timing,"" Thompson said, his voice tight. ""We've got that big shoot today, the one with the cosmetics company. We're already short-staffed.""

""I know, I'm sorry,"" Joshua said, ""but I really don't feel up to it. I think I might be getting sick.""

""Well, you should have thought of that before,"" Thompson snapped. ""We're counting on you, Carpenter. You know how important this contract is.""

""I understand,"" Joshua said, ""but I really can't come in. I'm not feeling well at all.""

""Look, Carpenter,"" Thompson said, his voice hardening, ""I'm not going to force you to come in. But if you don't show up today, you can consider yourself fired.""

Joshua was taken aback. ""Fired? Just like that?""

""That's right,"" Thompson said. ""I've had enough of your excuses. You've been unreliable lately, always taking time off. I need someone who's going to be here, someone I can count on.""

""But I've always been a good worker,"" Joshua protested. ""I've never missed a shoot before.""

""That's not true,"" Thompson said. ""You missed that shoot last month, the one with the swimsuit models. You said you had a family emergency, but I later found out you were just hungover.""

""That was one time,"" Joshua said, his voice rising. ""And it wasn't a family emergency. It was a personal issue.""

""Whatever it was, it cost us money,"" Thompson said. ""And now, this. I'm done with you, Carpenter. You're fired.""

""You can't do this,"" Joshua said, his voice trembling with anger. ""You can't just fire me like that.""

""I can and I am,"" Thompson said. ""And don't bother coming back for your things. I'll have them sent to you.""

The line went dead. Joshua stared at the phone, his mind reeling. He couldn't believe what had just happened. He had been fired, just like that, without any warning. He felt a surge of anger, a burning resentment towards Thompson, towards the world, towards everything that had gone wrong in his life.

Then, a new thought crept into his mind, a dark suspicion that made his blood run cold. He remembered the two women from the bar, the ones who were now missing. He remembered the way Thompson had said he'd had enough of his excuses. He remembered the look in Thompson's eyes, a mixture of anger and disgust. He wondered if Thompson knew something, if he had heard something about what had happened at the bar. He wondered if the reason he was being fired was more than just a missed shoot. He wondered if it had something to do with the missing women, if someone had accused him of something… something foul. The thought made his stomach churn. Had one of the models said something? Accused him of something he didn't do? The whispers in his mind grew louder, more insistent, weaving a narrative of guilt and suspicion. He was being framed, he was sure of it. But by whom? And for what?

The phone slipped from Joshua's grasp, clattering to the floor. Fired. The word echoed in his mind, a death knell to any semblance of hope he still clung to. He was losing everything. His wife, his job, his sanity. The whispers intensified, feeding on his despair, painting him as a failure, a monster, a man deserving of nothing but pain. He felt a crushing weight on his chest, a suffocating despair that made it hard to breathe. What was the point anymore? He was alone, broken, and utterly lost.

He stumbled into the bathroom, his reflection in the cracked mirror a grotesque caricature of himself. His eyes were bloodshot, his face pale and gaunt. He looked like a stranger, a man he didn't recognize. He stared at his reflection, a wave of self-loathing washing over him. He couldn't do this anymore. He couldn't bear the pain, the whispers, the constant fear that he was losing his mind.

He reached into the medicine cabinet, his hand trembling. He pulled out a bottle of pills, his fingers fumbling with the child-proof cap. He stared at the pills in his palm, small and white, a promise of oblivion. He brought them to his lips, his eyes closing. He was ready to give up, to surrender to the darkness that was consuming him.

Suddenly, a searing pain ripped through his abdomen, doubling him over. He gasped, the pills scattering across the floor. It wasn't like the earlier pain, this was sharper, more intense, like something was tearing him apart from the inside. He clutched his stomach, his body convulsing. He felt something moving inside him, something alien and terrifying. It was like the nightmare, the feeling of something being birthed from within.

He stumbled back from the mirror, his eyes wide with terror. He looked down at his stomach, and a wave of nausea washed over him. The skin was distended, stretched taut, and beneath the surface, he could see something moving, writhing. It was a grotesque, pulsating mass, pushing against his flesh, trying to break free.

The pain was excruciating, a burning, tearing sensation that made him scream. He fell to his knees, his body wracked with spasms. He felt like he was being ripped apart from the inside out, the monster within him struggling to escape. He was trapped, a vessel for something inhuman, something that was slowly, violently, taking over his body, his mind, his very soul. The pills, the despair, the self-destruction – all forgotten in the face of this new, unimaginable horror. He was no longer in control. He was becoming something else, something terrifying, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

The morning sun streamed through the gaps in the drawn curtains, casting long, distorted shadows across the living room floor. Tristan stood on Joshua's porch, knocking insistently. ""Josh? You in there, man?"" He'd been trying to reach Joshua all night, a growing unease gnawing at him. Josh hadn't answered his calls, and something about their last conversation, the sheer terror in Josh's voice, had Tristan worried sick. He pounded on the door again, his knuckles white. Silence.

""Josh, come on, man, open up!"" He rattled the doorknob, finding it locked. He hesitated, a bad feeling settling in his gut. ""Oh buddy,"" he muttered, ""I'm sorry for this one."" He stepped back, took a deep breath, and kicked the door with all his might. The wood splintered, the door crashing inward with a resounding bang.

Immediately, a piercing alarm shrieked through the house, startling Tristan. He hadn't expected that. He stumbled inside, the sight that greeted him making his blood run cold. It wasn't just messy. It was… a massacre. The walls, the floors, the furniture – everything was covered in blood. Thick, dark, crimson blood. It was splattered, smeared, tracked across the carpet in grotesque patterns. The air was heavy with the coppery scent of it, a sickeningly sweet odor that made his stomach churn.

""Josh! Josh, are you here?"" He called out, his voice trembling, his eyes darting around the room, searching for his friend. He stepped carefully through the carnage, his shoes crunching on shards of glass and… something else. He didn't want to think about what it was.

""Josh, answer me!"" He moved through the house, his heart pounding in his chest, each room a scene of unspeakable horror. He found the overturned coffee table, the shattered lamp, the broken mirror in the bathroom – all bathed in blood. He reached the bedroom door, his hand shaking as he pushed it open.

""WHAT THE FUCK!""

Tristan recoiled, his stomach lurching. He stumbled back, his hand flying to his mouth. He barely made it to the hallway before he vomited, the contents of his stomach heaving onto the blood-soaked carpet. The scene in the bedroom was beyond anything he could have imagined, a tableau of unimaginable gore. He couldn't bring himself to look again, but the image was seared into his brain, a nightmare made real. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that Joshua was gone. Not just gone from the house, but gone from this world, consumed by something dark and monstrous.

Tristan stumbled back, his stomach heaving. He couldn't bring himself to look into the bedroom again, the image of what he'd seen burned into his mind. But he had to. He had to know. He took a shaky breath and forced himself to turn back, his eyes scanning the room, searching for Joshua.

And then he saw him.

M, 42, single, two cats, living in a small apartment. 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve struggled with cleaning. It always felt like an endless battle—something I’d push off until the mess became unbearable. I told myself it didn’t really matter, but deep down, I knew it did.

That’s why I started this journey. If I couldn’t fix this, how could I expect to make progress in other areas of my life?

# The Trigger: A Visit That Changed Everything

What finally pushed me to take action? **A visit from my younger god-son.**

I wanted my place to look at least somewhat presentable, so I started cleaning. And once I started, I couldn’t stop. Suddenly, I was seeing my apartment in a new light—not just as a place I existed in, but as a space I could actively shape.

💡 **PRO TIP:** If you struggle with keeping your home tidy, **start hosting guests regularly.** The simple knowledge that someone will see your space—even once a month—is a powerful motivator.

And it doesn’t even have to be in-person. **Video call your friends or family from home.** If you know someone could see your surroundings, you’ll be more likely to keep things in order. It works like magic.

# The Game-Changers That Made the Difference

1️⃣ **You’re Not Just Cleaning—You’re Building a Home You Love**

This was the biggest mindset shift for me. I used to think of cleaning as an annoying chore—something I had to do. But now, I see it differently.

I’m **not just tidying up; I’m creating a space I actually want to live in.** A home should feel like a place you love being in—not just somewhere you sleep, eat, and work.

And I’m making it even better. I’m planning to buy **an espresso machine** (because good coffee makes everything better), **a new record player** (since I collect vinyl), and **some nice art** to hang on the walls. My space isn’t just clean now—it’s becoming a reflection of who I am.

It’s a form of self-respect. When your environment is peaceful, **you feel peaceful.**

2️⃣ **A Messy Home Is a Burden**

For years, I never realized how much my messy apartment was weighing me down. But once I cleaned it, the difference was night and day.

Waking up in a chaotic, cluttered space makes it so much harder to start the day. It drains you before you’ve even done anything. Everything feels heavier—like your surroundings are working against you.

But when everything is clean, **you wake up energized.** You literally feel lighter. Instead of dragging yourself out of bed, you **jump out of bed feeling good in your own skin.**

3️⃣ **The 'Broken Window' Principle: Clean Messes Fast**

There’s a psychological concept called the *Broken Window Theory.* It suggests that when one window in a building is broken and left unrepaired, soon, all the windows will be broken.

Why? Because visible neglect invites more neglect.

The same applies to your home. If you let one mess sit, **it attracts more mess.**

🔹 A few dishes in the sink? Soon, the whole sink will be full.  
🔹 A jacket on a chair? In a few days, the chair turns into a clothing rack.  
🔹 A little dust? It becomes layers of dust before you even notice.

The solution? **Fix small messes immediately.** Wash the dishes as soon as you’re done eating. Put things back in their place right away. **Tiny actions prevent big messes.**

4️⃣ **Get a Robovac—It’s a Game-Changer**

This was a small purchase that had a massive impact. A robot vacuum isn’t just a cleaning tool—it’s a **habit enforcer.**

To keep the robovac running smoothly, I had to clear my floors. And once I got used to having clear floors, I couldn’t tolerate clutter anywhere else. **It set a higher standard for my space.**

If you have a clean floor but a messy room, the imbalance feels wrong. **So, you naturally start tidying everything else too.**

💡 **Want to get one?** Check out **Vacuum Wars** (YouTube & website). They compare models based on performance, durability, and features, so you can make an informed choice.

5️⃣ **Make Your Bed First Thing in the Morning**

I used to think this advice was silly. But I finally understand what Admiral McRaven meant when he said:

>

When everything else in your home is clean, an unmade bed **sticks out.** You feel an urge to fix it—to restore balance.

And once you’ve done that one small task, you start the day with a win. **Momentum builds.** It’s not just about the bed—it’s about setting the tone for the day.

6️⃣ **It’s Easier to Maintain a Clean Home Than to Clean a Messy One**

This is the golden rule.

Letting your home get messy means you’ll eventually have to do a huge, exhausting deep-clean that takes hours (or even an entire weekend).

But maintaining a clean home? That takes **minutes.**

🔹 Wipe the counter after cooking.  
🔹 Do a quick reset before bed.  
🔹 Keep up with small, daily habits.

By doing a little every day, **you never have to do a massive cleaning session again.**

7️⃣ **Identify Your Blocking Points and Remove Them**

Here’s something I realized recently: **most of my mess came from just two small habits.**

The first was my **laundry basket.** I thought it would be more convenient to store my cats’ food on top of it. That one decision blocked me from using the basket, so I started leaving dirty clothes all over the house—on chairs, beds, and random surfaces. One small thing triggered a chain reaction of clutter.

The second was **delaying garbage disposal.** Instead of spending five minutes taking out the trash, I let bottles, cans, and wrappers pile up. That clutter spread from the kitchen to my desk, my table, and other areas, making my entire home feel chaotic.

The fix? **Remove the blockers.**

✅ Never use the laundry basket for anything other than laundry.  
✅ Take out the garbage immediately when it gets full.

The lesson here is simple: **tiny obstacles create massive messes.** If you’re struggling to keep your home clean, ask yourself:

🟢 What’s one small habit that’s creating unnecessary clutter?  
🟢 What minor change could eliminate that problem?

Often, fixing **one** small thing can save you hours of frustration.

# The Result? A Home That Feels Like Home

Two weeks ago, my apartment was a mess. Now, it’s a space I actually enjoy living in.

I realized that this wasn’t just about cleaning—it was about **building systems that make my life better.** Systems that turn my home into a place where I feel **calm, comfortable, and in control.**

And I’m not stopping here. With some art on the walls, a great espresso setup, and a new record player, this place will finally feel like **me.**

If you’ve struggled with this, start small. Pick **one** habit. Then another. And maybe, invite someone over next month. 😉",7,1739637290.0,HomeResetJourney,1,1.0,False
1iq56ai,https://i.redd.it/hq8mesipybje1.jpeg,Spilled coffee? No problem.,"Guys - I dropped a whole cup of coffee directly next to my right foot this morning. Mug broke, 10 oz of fresh coffee now dispersed evenly across my kitchen floor and monarchs. Little bit of Dawn, little Easy Clean - boom, gone.

These were hella cheap, so I'd be ok with them becoming beaters - or maybe even doing a full coffee dip. Glad to have restored that fresh white (for now)

When COVID hit, I had to shift to remote work, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise since I needed to be home due to family circumstances.

Last year, I resigned from a toxic remote job. By then, most interior design work had returned to onsite or hybrid setups, making it incredibly difficult to find another remote position. It’s been five months, and despite sending out countless applications, I can count the responses I’ve received on one hand. I’m losing hope, and on top of that, I’m drowning in debt—especially since my previous employer never gave me my last paycheck. I don’t want to fight for it anymore because it would only lead to more conflict.

Interior design is all I’ve ever done professionally, and I feel stuck. Should I keep pushing for another remote job, or should I pivot and pursue my passion?
 
Logically, I know it makes sense to find financial stability first—get an interior design job, pay off my debts, and then explore my passions once I have some savings.

That said, I’m deeply passionate about coffee, art, and pottery, but I don’t have the money to start a business in any of those areas. So, my question is: How can I pursue my passion without spending a dime?

More likely I’ll keep looking for an interior design job for now, but I’d love to hear your thoughts on how I can pursue my passion without spending a dime.

If you know of any remote interior design opportunities, I’d appreciate any leads as well.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iq52mt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iq52mt,"French RCIR - Menu 13, Farmer Hotpot and ""Carbonara ""","Best by: 14Mar2025

Shout out to Mike Kreischer for the hook up!

What a great menu this was! My midwestern US roots loved the hearty hotpot. 

The muesli was tangy due to the yogurt which made it really nice (it looks like chocolate but its actually cranberry yogurt). 

The carbonara couldn't have been farther from actual carbonara and the pic on the tin is nothing like what is in the actual tin! However, that did not stop it from being delicious anyway, especially with some black pepper and crushed red pepper added.

The salty biscuits were totally rancid, the cereal and chocolate were stunning ...not sure why such a strong divergence in quality there.

Just polished off the apricot jam and final packet of biscuits this morning, great as always.

Tuna and cheese spread was good and my kid loved the carmel pudding.

Coffee and hot chocolate were great as always too!

No scratches or bite marks, no fur pulled out, not traumatised by what happened at all. The other cat is also not hurt. I separated them within a few seconds, it felt like minutes though. Should I still call a vet?

So what happened was: We let our cats, B and H out into the fenced back yard for an hour from 4:30-5:30 PM. Either me or my mum keep a watch over them to make sure H doesn't jump the wall or kill a bird. B isn't a hunter. Mum was watching over them and came in to quickly take a look at the coffee he was making. In that moment a neighbours cat from a couple houses away jumped our fence. My mum heard a different meow so she quickly went to check. Mum walked towards them so the cat got scared and tried to jump the wall to leave, but our smart ass H decided to jump on him from the back. The cat got scared and wanted to attack H but he ran away, so he pounced on B instead. They fought for a couple seconds, B was trying to get away but he wouldn't stop. I was running towards them but they kept rolling away. Idk how many seconds it must've been, felt so long but surely under 30s when I finally managed to touch the neighbours cat. I lightly touched him, which scared him enough to stop and try to jump the fence to escape again. Took him 4 tries since the wall is quite high. B ran inside. When I got in to check on him, he was fine, wasn't hiding. His tail was fluffed up and hissed when H went close to him. So I separated them just in case. When I approached him, he let me, I could also pet him. His tail was still fluffed. I wanted to check him properly so I gave him treats. He did all the tricks enthusiastically. His tail went back to normal. It was dinner time so after the treats I went to give him dinner, he followed me like normal. Ate his food immediately. Not hissing at H either. He's behaving normal. He has no scratches or bite marks. He still keeps going to any one of the 3 doors that lead outside whenever they’re opened, wanting to go out. He's clearly not traumatised by the event.",3,1739636913.0,cats,2,1.0,False

ADDED CONTEXT/CLARIFICATION SO PLEASE READ AGAIN EVEN IF YOU ALREADY DID thank you!

We've been together for 2 and a half years, but we basically officially started dating on Valentines Day 2 years ago. Because the first Valentines I made him a diy Minecraft flower from wood cubes with a note that said 'You are mine and I am yours'. And he woke me up to a grocery store bouquet of flowers (I'm not hating on it or criticizing and I loved and appreciated it so much but it is what it is), a Starbucks coffee and Valentine themed cupcakes made by his friend. 

But the next year (1 year into our official relationship) I made him also a all handmade DIY coupon bundle with themes like, ""I'll make us ANY food you want"", ""Free scalp massage"", ""Free foot massage"", ""Free Oily massage"", ""Get out of an argument/you win"", ""We do anything you want for the whole day/an hour"", ""Get 8 billion kisses for the rest of your life"" etc lol You get it! And he didn't get anything for me last year, and I told him a few times that anything would have been nice, especially just a handwritten letter for me, that would mean so much to me. And the coupon gift I gave him is still sitting on a shelf in a closet, untouched and never used, even though I asked him quite a few times in the past year to remember it and use it please.. 

And this year it was nothing from him or me. I'm an international student and I have no income or pocket money, and he is aware of it. But I did have a few dollars that I had saved so I looked on Amazon a few days before Valentine's, for a gift and couldn't decide, (there was lego bonzai or a bamboo plant and I really couldn't decide between the two because I kept thinking he would like them both equally) so I put it off to ask him to choose it later himself as we didn't have a chance to sit down and actually like talk. I'm not sure why I didn't want to write him a letter or anything diy again, I felt like he would like legos more I guess. But today (on Valentines) he had nothing for me just like I had nothing. So I asked him why didn't he get me anything for Valentines and he asked me ""Did YOU get anything for me?"". So yeah basically I was hurt by that, and even though every girl around me was getting presents and flowers and posting it for everyone(me lol) to see and even though I kind of believe that mostly men should give the flowers and presents on Valentines day because in the country I'm from it's only common for only the men to surprise their gfs. But EVEN THOUGH I come from such a culture of a difference - for the last 2 years I tried and wanted him to feel special and loved and gave him what I thought were thoughtful gifts, but I feel like I'm not being reciprocated that just because I didn't get him anything this year. Like, do I really need to give him a present for him to give me one even though last year it was only me who gave him presents? Is that fair?",0,1739636808.0,relationshipadvice,14,0.25,False

1iq4uda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1iq4uda/the_painting_is_watching_me/,The painting is watching me ..,"PART ONE:

So I saw these signs for an estate sale last weekend and thought , what the hell , I'll bite. You see my family just bought a new house and we still need some inexpensive furnishings. That mortgage is hefty so I'm now thrifty. I don't mind it gives me a place to call home . It's all mine . Mine. Well anyways you get where im coming from. 

 So I pulled in to this monster of a 3 story house and it was pretty crowded but I made my way inside. Most of the furniture was outdated Victorian aesthetic and not really my style. I love the Gothic look but not into reds and velvets,im fairly particular on what exactly I wish to decorate my home with. Oh i know us blue collar families can't be too picky but I digress. The first floor was mainly already spoken for as far as furniture goes I liked a mahogany coffee table, but an elderly gentleman and i assume his wife were haggling over the price. Hearing the executor tell him he wasn't going below $400 I swallowed my temptation to laugh aloud over the thought of paying anything over $100 for a coffee table. Well that conversation set the president for the entire situation. I wasn't ready to give up outright but kinda figured I'd be sadly leaving empty handed. 

There was quite alot of people to shuffle behind on the first floor so I made my way through the kitchen, dining hall ( the only way to explain this opulence) peeking my head into the bathroom and sitting room I couldn't really look at much through the hoards of people. 

Making my way to the back of the house i saw a small narrow simple staircase. I bet this was the staffs designated route to their quarters and was the first open path I saw so I made my way up. Hoping maybe I could find something in my meager price range in the back. I can't help but wonder if I will be intrusive to the staff , if there even is one, at this point I'm only guessing. 

The stairs lead up to the third floor which wound up being significantly less ""1%"" if you know what I'm getting at . The walls were bare , the gard wood unfinished, the hallway was lit by a few sparse sconces, the smell of must was overwhelming and I kid you not I can hear a bird squawk. Now I am definitely curious about this because it sounds like the caw of a crow , so I lightly tapped on the first door to my left and receive no reply. I took a few steps and tapped on the door to my right and heard the caw again. Well let's just pretend here im concerned about rescuing a creature trapped somehow, maybe flew into an open window? So I try the door knob and it's unlocked. I looked around to see if there was anyone else up here and pushed the door open. 

This room was obviously for storage and hadn't been used as a living quarters in god knows how long . Stacks of paintings standing along the walls, furniture covered in sheets and across the room i see a dome shaped stand underneath a sheet. Upon hearing me enter the room i heard the caw again coming from underneath the sheet . I can't believe someone has stuck this poor animal in here , its 1000° no air circulation and reeks of filth. I pulled off the sheet and find a massive crow cramped in this fancy gold cage meant for a significantly smaller size bird. This poor guy started going nuts trying to flap his wings and couldn't without hitting the sides. Horrified at the sight I pick up the cage and storm out . Someone is going to explain this to me and make it right. I grabbed the cage and turned around and stomp my way back to the first floor. As i make my way back through the house everyone is stopping to turn and see where all bird rokus is coming from and I start barking at people yo show me who's in charge here. A young couple point me in the direction of an elderly gentleman standing in the foyer with a clipboard held against his chest. 
"" Oh dear"" he says in his snooty little weasel way "" I see you found your way to Poe. The mistresses raven. He's not for sale"" well an argument over the bird ensues and I make my point about his condition and lack of access to food or water and get a round of applause. 

"" Alright then. If you love this evil creature so much. Take him but let me tell you this. If you take Poe you must bring the mistresses portrait of him with you"" 

"" what portrait? Im not paying you a dime for this . "" I retort and he points his long gnarly finger back upstairs. 

"" It's in the room where you stole him from"" i informed him that he would have to retrieve the painting himself while I got the bird some water. To make an already long story a hair shorter I'll skip the details and fast forward. I put the painting wrapped in brown paper in the back of my jeep and poe in the passenger seat and brought him home . After a long evening of attempts to place him into a sanctuary or rescue my efforts wound up fruitless. So I set-up shop for him in my laundry room and made a veterinarian appointment for morning. His Wings were broken or clipped, either way Poe seemed to be flightless. 
 after an expensive trip to the pet store and an extensive argument with my husband, Poe had his own room to roam . I checked on him frequently but everytime I checked he was on a perch looking out the window. Totally forgetting about the painting his first Night was pretty quiet. 
 When I got up the next morning I opened the door and he was hanging upside down from the perch with his full wingspan open and motion less. I've never seen a bird hang like a bat before and ran to check him picking him up gently and placing him upright he began to chirp in way . I'm not educated in bird sounds but he sounded... Happy? 
I went into the kitchen and started breakfast for the family and heard my son come charging in through the front door painting in hand. It was about four foot tall and two foot wide and was an up close and personal oil painting of Poe . It was a profile view with this head turned to the left . Showing his right eye front and center. 
 "" Wierd picture"" my son said setting the painting down "" why would someone want a giant picture of Poe's eyeball?"" 
"" Yikes"" I said "" it looks like he's staring at us"" with a chill running down my spine. I shook it off and flicked on the morning news . I kid you not it was a 3 alarm house fire . The footage showed the house... Burning to the ground. ",3,1739636332.0,Horror_stories,1,1.0,False

I even walked all the way over to the food court area and the Duane Reade/Walgreens but didn’t see any. Finally just went over to the Starbucks and used the small compost bin next to the milk/sugar stirrers.

Later I saw a maintenance worker walking around with rolling bins, looking like he was maybe emptying trash cans… but when I watched him for a few minutes he just kind of cruised around the open area and picked up 1 or 2 cups that people had left behind (probably because there are no bins).

 I started all three more or less the same way with a third cup of ginger third cup of sugar and filled with distilled water. The oldest two jars were started in mason jars with a solid lid at first then I transition to a coffee filter. Wasn't seeing results only after the first couple of days did they begin a little bit of bubbling but then it would stop. 

First jar started on 1/30/25 second started on 2/2/25 third jar started 2 or so days later so on the 4th approximately when I started using the current set up in a airlock jars meant for fermenting I found in my basement. 

I feed every day 1 tbls of ginger 1 tbls of organic cane sugar unless I forget. After about a week the 3rd bug started bubbling pretty well and getting foam on top so I made raspberry tea with 1/2 cup sugar per liter chilled it then added about 1/2 cup of bug to the 1L bottles each with chilled tea to try and make soda it's been about 2 or so days with no noticeable carbonation from the bug. I thought because it was cold maybe it killed the yeast so I added another 1/4th cup bug to each bottle. That was yesterday. If I shake the bottle it foams but if it sits I don't notice really any fizz.

Jars 1 abd 2 have the bubbles on the side of the jar 3rd jar was bubbling before harvesting. I store them in my pantry on the upper shelf so it stays in the dark/low light levels.

I 42F and my husband 40M have been married for almost 19 years we have 2 kids 13F & 7F. He works from home since covid and has more time and movement flexibility than I do during the day as he doesn't have anyone there to monitor him, I am an assistant manager at a bank, I am there from 8:15 to 5:15 and can leave only on breaks and lunch unless the manager is off in which i can't leave and don't get a break or lunch. Yesterday was Valentine's Day and a Friday, Fridays are our late days he was supposed to work from 10 until 7 and I normally work from 9:15 to 6:15 but my boss was off so I worked from 8 to 6:15 with no ability to leave the bank or have a break. I got off work at 6:15 and went to run 2 errands, I went to get some last minute gifts for him, my mom (75F widow), and the kids from the dollar store and the grocery store, and to get hamburger buns that he asked me to pick up. I spent about 45 minutes getting the stuff and had to go to my moms house to pick up our kids since my mom watches them for us after school. (Our kids go to school in the city I work not where we live so I get them up in the morning, make them lunch/snack physically dress the 7 year old and drop them off either at school or at grandmas before I go to work.) When I get to my moms house I see my sister is there (there was some drama a few months ago over something stupid and I haven't seen her since Christmas) I also get a text from him saying dinner is ready. It's now 7pm and he was supposed to be just getting off work but since he works from home he can cook while he is supposed to be working. He also ran an errand to the dollar store to get last minute treats and cards but while he was supposed to be working. I go in the house, give my mom her valentines gift and tell the girls it's time to go home dad has dinner ready. They drag to leave, I am catching up with my sister and keep reminding the girls it's time to go, the oldest is ready about 10 or so minutes later the youngest still has all her valentines out on the coffee table and for some reason has now taken her shirt of I keep telling her to get her stuff put away and it was time to leave. About 7:30 we are all saying goodbye and leave. I drive home which takes about 15 minutes, I get home and it's just before 8 pm. We go in the house and we wait for husband to come out of the office and we all open our presents. After we are done and everyone clears out I say to my husband let's eat dinner, he then informs me that he already ate and my dinner is in the fridge. He says ""I told you earlier this week what I planned to do, I was hungry so I ate dinner"".

He doesn't see that he did anything wrong and told me I was 3 hours late when I was home an hour and 45 minutes after work. He thinks it's my fault because I didn't rush the kids to get home faster because he took it upon himself to start making dinner a full hour before he was supposed to be off work and when I wasn't home yet.

Ok let me say this na sa simula palang, i always consider this as a “me” problem. I can rise above this, i knowwww. Ako ang problema pero sobrang di na mawala sa isip ko yung pagkadismaya kaya gusto ko lang malabas tong nararamdaman ko.

Bale 2nd work ko na ito and im just burned out, STILL burned out, dahil sa pagkairita ng mga nangyayari everyday. From mga kupal na pasyente (na downright disrespectful nalang) to the unfair boss and pagpasa pasa ng workload papunta sakin ng mga katrabaho ko. Umagang umaga ramdam ko na yung ageism. Lahat ng nangyayari sa work ako agad bintang unless i defend myself right there and then, and if ever i defend myself may way yung boss ko to show na it is still my problem??? Kahit na most of the time sakanya nagsisimula yung problema? Mislabeled specimens, nakalimutan fillupan yung forms, misplacement ng mga eklabush, etc etc. Pati pagkakape ko problema? Kesyo di ako nagsasabi na irefill mga ginagamit for coffee? (Syempre sabi ko na “maam isang buwan na ako di nagkakape dito. Imposibleng ako yung nakakaubos niyan” zzzz). Stuff like that yung nangyayari and it irritates me ngayon na parang nagfflashback lahat. Sa mga pasyente naman sobrang umay na ako masabihang “maam sorry pero iba nalang kukuha ng dugo ko. Ang bata mo pa kasi” (ok pa na may sorry hindi yung mamatahin ka from head to toe tas tatarayan ka nalang) o kaya “maam ayus ayusin mo lang pagtusok ha. One shot lang.” O KAYA “tsk tsk tsk. Di ganyan yung isang medtech na tumusok sakin dati” Pero nakakuha ako ng dugo? So ano pinaggagawa mo mæm? Gets ko po okay. Masakit ang tusok. Susugatan ko kayo literal dahil sa tusok na yon kaya alam kong masakit pero kailangan. Utos ng doktor niyo yan mga mæm and sir! Ang lala pa na sila na may kailangan sakin to ask and do stuff pero ako pa tong nababastos. MÆM AND SIR ARE YOU SURE SA APPROACH NIYO SAKIN? R u sure na ba talaga na magbabastusan tayo??? May sakit ka na nga bastos ka pa. Di mo ba iniistress lalo sarili mo sa pinaggagawa mo? And no haha di mahal mga procedure samin. I actually think nagccharity work nalang boss ko sa presyo na binibigay niya sa mga pasyente eh. Sa mga katrabaho ko naman jusko po! HAHAHA mga maling nangyayari sa lab akin agad sisi? Buti nalang nadedefend ko sarili ko by showing proof and most of the time bumabalik din sakanila mga pinagbibintang nila sakin.

So litol background lang para magkaintindihan kasi dagdag ito sa hinanakit ko eh. Nakuha ko yung work (more like kinuha) kasi nirequest sakin ng nanay ng bf (now ex) ko to reconsider kahit malayo yung place and toxic everyday yung trabaho. Nagkawork na kasi ako niyan by my own efforts and nireject ko yang 2nd workplace na yan dahil sa layo. Di commute friendly. Pero kasi u know hahah bait kasi sakin ng nanay ng bf ko so napapayag na din nila ako sa dulo. Tandang tanda ko how i cant rant about my work sa bf ko kasi ang “swerte” ko na daw. Libre lunch. Hahaha. Yun na yon? Libre lunch kasi ayaw niyang lalabas pa kami to have lunch, which means di namin nagagamit ng maayos yung 1hr lunch break (ngayon nasa 15min nalang lunch break ko haha. Mind u di ko na nagagamit yung 15min coffee break namin).

Simula sa latter half ng january hanggang first half ng february, 1hour late ako. Sinasadya ko na. I just cant. Sabi ko sa sarili ko na bigay ko na yang 1hr late para sa sarili ko. Kahapon yung last day ko to allow myself na maging late ulit and kailangan ko na ayusin ulit attendance ko next week gang maabo nalang (char). Sakto din na kahapon talaga naurat na ako sa boss ko (pero syempre professionalism padin tayo so di ko pinakita na naiinis na ako) kasi sinabihan na niya akong ayusin oras ng pasok ko at gawing priority ang work.

To be straight up, they have never been there for me emotionally since my birth, my mom will come and try to resolve any big fights I have with her or ask me to forget about it and move on if it was with my dad, and that is kind of a reason I still have kind of a soft side for her, but my dad though, he has only been there for the financial aid and emotional torture, to be straight up I purely have no feelings for that man other than hate.

So today, I went to make some coffee for myself and while making it, my mom called me to come and look at her leg (she had gone through an accident a week earlier and had a small scratch on her left leg which had kind of got an infection I guess, nothing very serious) I just said ""mujhe nahi dekhna"" but she insisted because she just wanted attention, considering the fight we had yesterday where both my parents told me how much they hate me and hit me with lines like ""paida hote hi mar jana chahiye tha"" etc. I was just not in the mood to talk to them, but she asks me again to look at her leg and I let my cool lose for a second and say ""sad jayega apka pair"" I tried to tone it in a funny way so she wouldn't take it as seriously (i usually do make jokes like this to her) but she took it very literally and started saying stuff like ""tumhare liye kya kya nahi kiya hai, 9 mahine pait me pala hai, hamesha subah subah khana banake deti hu"" etc. and got all emotional about it when it was just not that deep compared to the awful things they say to me. She then purposely cries in front of my father who then gets mad at me and say's ""road pe bheek mangega tu, kutte ki maut marega"" etc., I have just gotten used to such comments at this point, it's a daily thing but the one time I say anything close to what they tell me daily, they can't take it, and when I told this to them they said  ""maa baap ham hai ya tum"", I'm sorry I dint know that being a parent lets you say such ungodly things to your child. I go to a college that is quite far away and takes a lot of time to travel to, so I am going to shift to a pg close to the college next semester, can't wait to get away from these awful people I have to sadly call as my parents.",24,1739636095.0,OffMyChestIndia,28,0.96,False

Does anybody have any experience with this? Is it crazy to request a new trainer who will meet in a more private setting?",7,1739636046.0,Type1Diabetes,25,1.0,False
