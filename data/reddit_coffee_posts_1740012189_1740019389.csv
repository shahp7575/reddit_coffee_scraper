Chapter 1: A City of Dreams and Nightmares
In the heart of Asheville, North Carolina, where the Blue Ridge Mountains cradle the town, the air was thick with the scent of coffee and freshly baked pastries. It was a city that lured many with its artistic spirit, vibrant music scene, and lush landscapes. For Sarah Mitchell, it had been a refuge‚Äîa place to escape the hardships of her past. But as she sipped her morning brew at the local caf√©, a heavy weight settled in her chest.
Sarah worked as a receptionist at a bustling law firm downtown, earning a mere $14.50 an hour. Despite her best efforts to budget, each month felt like a Herculean struggle to make rent for her tiny, one bedroom apartment in West Asheville. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about the experience,‚Äù her friends told her, but they weren‚Äôt the ones struggling to keep the lights on.
Each day, Sarah watched as the cost of living crept higher, squeezing her and countless others in the city. Her apartment, once affordable, now felt like a luxury‚Äîa sentiment echoed by her coworkers, who were also feeling the pinch of soaring rent prices.
Chapter 2: The Cost of Living
As she walked to work, Sarah passed the many ‚ÄúFor Rent‚Äù signs plastered across lawns, often accompanied by heart wrenching ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving‚Äù flyers from her neighbors. Each sign felt like a blow to her heart, a reminder of the precarious situation many found themselves in. The owners of these properties, driven by greed and the allure of profit, had jacked up the prices. It felt as though the city she loved was turning against its residents.
After another exhausting day at the law firm, Sarah returned home to find an eviction notice taped to her door. Panic coursed through her veins as she read the bold letters: ‚ÄúRent increase effective immediately.‚Äù She had already stretched her budget to the limit; there was no room for more. As tears blurred her vision, she thought of the homeless encampments that had begun to populate the edges of downtown, each one a reminder of the harsh reality facing so many.
Chapter 3: A Community in Crisis
That evening, Sarah joined a local meeting organized by the Asheville Tenants Union. The room was filled with weary faces, each person sharing their own horror stories. As the discussion unfolded, a theme emerged: greedy landlords and real estate agents had created an environment where basic shelter was now a privilege.
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care about us,‚Äù one woman exclaimed. ‚ÄúThey only see dollar signs!‚Äù
Sarah felt a surge of solidarity in the room. She began to understand that her struggle was not hers alone. The group shared resources, and Sarah found comfort in their camaraderie. They began strategizing ways to pressure landlords to stabilize rents and advocate for affordable housing initiatives.
Chapter 4: The Fight for Change
With newfound determination, Sarah became an active member of the union. She collaborated with her neighbors, organized rallies, and advocated for a rent control policy that would protect vulnerable residents from the greed of landlords. The movement began to gain momentum, attracting attention from local media. They shared stories of how the rising cost of living was not just a number‚Äîit represented families being displaced, people losing their homes, and dreams being shattered.
As the momentum grew, so did the backlash from real estate agents and landlords who felt threatened by the union‚Äôs efforts. The battle lines were drawn, but Sarah was undeterred. She had a vision of a more equitable Asheville‚Äîone where the beauty of the mountains was accessible to all, not just those who could afford exorbitant rents.
Chapter 5: The Turning Tide
Weeks turned into months, and despite the setbacks, the movement sparked change. Local politicians began taking notice, and discussions around affordable housing policies began to surface. Sarah felt hope blooming in her heart‚Äîa feeling she hadn‚Äôt experienced in a long time. Perhaps her voice, along with those of her neighbors, could make a difference.
Then came the fateful day when the city council convened to discuss rent control measures. As Sarah stood outside the building, flanked by her friends and allies, she felt a rush of adrenaline. She was fighting not just for her own survival, but for everyone who had been pushed to the margins.
Chapter 6: A New Beginning
Months later, the city passed new legislation to regulate rent increases, marking a significant victory for the Asheville Tenants Union. The fight was far from over, but Sarah felt a renewed sense of purpose. She understood that real change takes time, but with solidarity and perseverance, they could reshape their community.
As she walked through the streets of Asheville, now buzzing with the vibrant life of its residents, Sarah found herself reflecting on her journey. The mountains loomed in the distance, a reminder of the beauty that could coexist with the struggles of daily life. She had discovered not just a fight for rent control, but a deeper connection to her community.",1,1740019313.0,asheville,0,1.0,False

Also random question but are you allowed to bring your own snacks (skittles, chocolate, chips) in the flight deck with you when you fly (especially long flights) or are there strict rules as to what you're allowed to eat while on duty? lol pilots always talk about their coffee spilling with turbulence but what about your snacks?

My father committed suicide,  so did my brother.   I used to think i would too.  I had a change in my psyche about 3 years ago when I watched a Norm Macdonald video about being content and happy to be alive ""you can go to Denny's, you can wear a hat...""). He was recorded on a late night talk show; Carson Daly.  He knew he was dying,  but 'no one' else did. After he died,  i saw this video clip and it completely fixed me.   I no longer had suicidal thoughts,  I am happy to be so lucky to exist.   My problem is that,  the most beautiful and kind woman in the world chose to be with me and lately all she does is complain.  First thing in the morning,  complaint.  Any given moment in the day,  complaint.  She's constanly complaining but, she didn't used to.  I'm worried. She gets offended by everything i say,  she talks to me in a negative tone,  i am constantly having to defend myself; about the relationship or the coffee or the dogs but mostly about how I'm not treating her correctly.

She just turned 23 in December and graduated from school this past may after playing basketball her entire academic career. I love her and her family so much as well, they took me under their wing and showered me with love when I needed it most.
 
I‚Äôve been going through a pretty low and isolated phase for the past 8 months after a lot had happened. We still talked every few weeks or so but it ended up getting to a point of once a month after September. I promised my self to put the effort into my friends and myself coming into the new year I was trying to get better with communicating with everyone in my life and started with her. I explained to her just everything been going on. She was super understanding and made me feel loved truly; she came to see me literally the next day at work. I got to hug her one last time. Something super major happened with my car the next day or so that really depressed me and I backed off for 2 weeks because I was just so overridden with thoughts. I never spoke to her, saw her, or texted her after I saw her that day. 

Having trouble dealing with all the emotions. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to feel honestly. Really feels unreal I just feel overflown with sadness every time I think about everything which is every second. Why did I not make myself spend more time with her I didn‚Äôt expect it to just run out like this so unexpectedly. I feel so guilty I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I just miss my sweet friend. I wish I didn‚Äôt take that time alone from everyone but mainly her obviously. I hate myself for it but I just wanna take my love for her as motivation to stay present in peoples lives and make better effort to communicate even when I‚Äôm in the rut.

1itnvan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Synesthesia/comments/1itnvan/my_temperaturetaste_synesthesia/,My temperature-taste synesthesia,"For as long as I can remember, everything tastes sweeter when it's warm, and more bitter when it's cold. Another interesting side effect is that if something is super cold or super hot, then there is an overwhelming taste of nothingness that seems to overpower any other tastes that may be there. I fondly remember how I thought I discovered a life hack by leaving soda or juice in the car on a hot summer day to make it taste 100 times sweeter, or how I was always confused as to why everyone hates melted ice cream, when it tastes so much sweeter. 

One day, after leaving a bottle of water out in the cold, and being revolted by its bitter, chemicaly taste, I thought to myself ""Wait a second, water is supposed to taste like nothing all the time"". That's when I started connecting the dots. Just to make sure, I asked other people if the taste of food is so drastically altered for them by its temperature, and I kept confirming it is not the case. Unfortunately, although I had identified it as a form of synesthesia, I have never found and records of this specific type of synesthesia ever, so I thought I might as well be the first to open up this discussion. 

Since it is only natural for most people to like sweet things, I myself like almost all of my food to be warm. It's like I have a sweet tooth specifically for warm food, and in fact, taking it away has been difficult and not even necessary for my health anyways, and thereby pointless. My partner likes to say that I'm lucky since it makes cutting down on sugars easier, and they're mostly correct, though some sweet things I crave can't be replicated by warming up some not otherwise sweet food. 

I sometimes think about how curious it must be to others that meat to me normally tastes like it's lathered in syrup, since it's usually served warm, and how that's just how meat is ""supposed to"" taste like to me. I've tried lukewarm meat (so not sweet, just savory) and I gotta admit, it tastes odd, although still not bad by any means. 

One of the most common questions I get asked is about ice cream. Yes, it does taste bittersweet to me. I don't think I'll ever be able to taste what ice cream is like to everyone else, though I'd love to try a room temperature version of it if it ever becomes a thing. I still somewhat enjoy it from time to time. Despite its bitterness, its sweetness is still noticable, albeit weak. Sometimes I'll microwave it for a few seconds to get ever so closer to what it's supposed to taste like.

Another interesting thing is I drink black tea, coffee, even espresso, completely black. I try to cut down on sugars in my diet, and when its warm, it all tastes sweetened anyways. However, once in a blue moon, I'll put it in the fridge overnight and drink it in the morning cold, because when it's super bitter like that, it gives me an extra kick in the morning that helps wake me up. 

Water I strictly prefer to be lukewarm. I neither like the taste of sugar-water, nor bitter water.

Pizza is one of the foods I love at all temperatures. Sure, it always tastes better when it's warm, but lukewarm pizza is still amazing, and even when it's cold/bitter, pizza is still god tier. That's how epic pizza is. 

Because I'm trying to cut down on sugars, I've had quite a few incidents where I asked ""wait, did someone add a lot of sugar to this, or is it my synesthesia again""? I have to ask my partner just to make sure. Similarly, I recently had some hot salsa (room temperature) and it tasted overwhelmingly sweet. I asked others if they taste the sweeteness and they told me they don't taste any sweetness. I then had a friend suggest that it could be the fact that spice triggers my heat receptors, it also triggers my synesthesia. It would certainly make sense. Likewise, I've played around with peppermint oil and menthol and discovered that it tastes super bitter. Now sure if other people here have tasted either, but if they have and it's not bitter to them, then I guess it's the same effect as with spice but the opposite, that is, cold receptors triggering a bitter taste.",1,1740018676.0,Synesthesia,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1itns5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/radio/comments/1itns5i/nostalgia/,Nostalgia,"The summer after my sophomore year at James Madision University, I served as an intern with WYYD, the central Virginia country radio station which was at the height of its powers in the mid-nineties, dominating market share and serving as a cultural touchstone in the heyday of Garth Brooks, Martina McBride, and Shania Twain long before bro-country, cell phones, and no smoking signs.

I spent time with multiple divisions, including sales, engineering, and leadership, but my favorite, by far, were my many hours on-air.  The idea was that I would rotate responsibilities and exposure every few weeks, but I developed such a relationship with the morning DJ's that they invited me to participate in the Steve & Dave show every morning throughout the summer before going out on sales calls, riding up to the broadcast tower on the mountain, or sitting in a management meeting.  

Steve and Dave (his real name was Robin, but they already had a Robynn on the afternoon drive shift) were neurotic, hilarious, overcaffeinated, and largely fueled by nicotine and cynicism, but they loved having a built-in teenage laugh track and a youngster to make fun of or send on prank assignments.  They pejoratively dubbed me ""Rainboy"" because Rainman had been a recent hit and my middle name made it a natural choice.  

One morning, a relatively uneventful show nearly turned into a conflagratory event when either Steve or Dave failed to adequately extinguish their cigarette prior to tossing it in the trashcan.  It's a wonder I didn't pick up a smoker's cough that summer as the leadership, the salesman, and especially the talent tore through cartons of coffin nails throughout the workday back when indoor smoking was still an acceptable behavior.  While Steve was working the sound board during a commercial break, Dave was visible through the picture window running back and forth in the hall waving his hands in the suddenly smokey air, looking for a fire extinguisher.  I left the DJ booth and found a small plastic waste basket in the break room with flames shooting up perhaps 18 inches.  I smothered the flames with a box of printer paper almost immediately, but that didn't stop Dave from spraying the extinguisher foam all over the smokey, melted mess and then dumping his coffee on it for good measure.  When we returned to the booth, Steve was very professionally continuing with the show, but invited us both to process the ""nearly catastrophic"" event on air.  It was the rare time that they couldn't mock Rainboy for being a silly intern and they even let me have the mic for a bit without interrupting.  A couple of callers even suggested that I should get my own shift.  

Bowing to public pressure and always on the lookout for a new bit, shortly thereafter, Steve and Dave sent me to the Kroger down the street for what felt like an elaborate gag at the time.  There was a bank of pay phones in the entryway near the grocery carts and they had me on one line calling in details of passers-by while ringing one of the other payphones in the hopes that someone would answer and join them on-air as they pretended to be telepathic while sharing the details that I had been feeding them.  I, being me, was not particularly subtle and I couldn't help but laugh as people initially struggled to figure out how Steve knew what they were wearing.  It didn't take long for management to figure out that something was going on.

An older cashier asked me to please hang up the phone and come with him to talk to ""security"".  He walked me to an office where I was left alone...with a phone on the desk.  

I called back into the show envisioning a Free Rainboy movement when they put me on the air, but I only got Dave on a smoke break.  He was uncharacteristically emotional about the idea of his intern being imprisoned at the grocery story as we brainstormed solutions.  

""What if I just walk out?""

""Yeah, yeah, do that!  No laws have been broken; they can't hold you.Run, Rainboy, ruuuuuun!""

I slipped out the unlocked door and got to my car just in time to turn on the radio and hear, ""We're just getting details that Rainboy has been detained by Kroger security and we just don't know if we're going to have to bail him out or if this could be the end of his internship.""  

Recognizing that this was my big moment, I sped back to the studio and burst through the doors of the DJ booth despite the unmistakable red ""on-air"" light, falling on the floor laughing as I explained that I ""got the hell out of there"".  Now, smoking was allowed, but even mild profanity was profoundly frowned upon in those halcyon days.  My next session with leadership included a tongue-lashing, but Steve and Dave were in LOVE with the reactions that they were getting from listeners, who found the entire event hilarious.  

It was a formative summer, including several live appearances at Cattle Annies, the then brand new country line dancing space in Lynchburg, and a very niche local celebrity status which led to more attention than this farm boy had ever had from a variety of interesting characters who religiously followed the morning show, but those will have to be stories for another day.",1,1740018415.0,radio,0,1.0,False

When selling products online, visibility is everything. No matter how great your product is, if potential buyers can't find it, your sales will suffer. That‚Äôs where keywords come in. Strategic keyword placement in product listings is one of the most effective ways to improve search rankings and attract customers. In this article, we‚Äôll explore why keywords matter and how to use them effectively in your product listings.


---

Why Are Keywords Important in Product Listings?

1. Improves Search Visibility

Most online shoppers start by searching for what they need. Whether they're using Google, Etsy, Amazon, or another marketplace, search engines rely on keywords to show relevant results. By including the right keywords in your product title and description, you increase your chances of appearing in search results.

2. Increases Click-Through Rates (CTR)

When your product listing matches what shoppers are looking for, they are more likely to click on it. A well-optimized title with clear, descriptive keywords makes your product more appealing and relevant to buyers.

3. Boosts Conversion Rates

If your listing contains keywords that accurately describe your product, shoppers are more likely to find exactly what they need. This reduces confusion, builds trust, and increases the likelihood of a purchase.

4. Enhances SEO Ranking

On platforms like Etsy, Amazon, and Google, product listings with relevant keywords rank higher. These platforms use algorithms to determine which products to show first. Using the right keywords signals to search engines that your product is relevant, improving its ranking over time.


---

Where to Place Keywords in Your Product Listings

1. Product Title

The title is the most critical part of your listing. It should be clear, descriptive, and include your main keywords.
Example: Instead of ‚ÄúHandmade Mug,‚Äù use ‚ÄúHandmade Ceramic Coffee Mug ‚Äì Rustic Pottery Cup for Tea & Coffee‚Äù.

2. Product Description

Write a natural, engaging description that includes secondary keywords throughout. Avoid keyword stuffing‚Äîmake sure the text flows smoothly.
Example: Instead of ‚ÄúThis mug is handmade. Ceramic mug. Pottery mug,‚Äù use:
""This beautifully handcrafted ceramic coffee mug is perfect for enjoying your morning tea or coffee. Made from high-quality clay, this rustic pottery cup adds a warm touch to any kitchen.""

3. Tags and Attributes

Many platforms allow you to add tags or attributes (e.g., color, material, style). Use these fields to include additional relevant keywords.

4. Image Alt Text

Search engines can't ""see"" images, but they read alt text (a short description of the image). Use descriptive keywords to help your images rank in search results.
Example: Instead of ‚ÄúIMG123.jpg,‚Äù use ‚Äúhandmade-ceramic-mug-rustic-coffee-cup.jpg‚Äù.

5. Product Categories and Subcategories

Selecting the right category and subcategory helps marketplaces show your product in relevant searches. Some platforms also use category names as ranking factors.


---

How to Find the Best Keywords for Your Listings

1. Use Search Suggestions ‚Äì Start typing your product name in a search bar (Google, Etsy, Amazon) and see what suggestions pop up. These are commonly searched terms.


2. Check Competitor Listings ‚Äì Look at top-ranking competitors and see what keywords they use.


3. Use Keyword Research Tools ‚Äì Tools like Etsy‚Äôs Search Analytics, Google Keyword Planner, and Marmalead can help you find high-ranking keywords.


4. Analyze Customer Language ‚Äì Pay attention to how customers describe your products in reviews, questions, or messages.




---

Common Keyword Mistakes to Avoid

Keyword Stuffing ‚Äì Overloading your listing with keywords makes it hard to read and can hurt rankings.

Irrelevant Keywords ‚Äì Using misleading keywords to attract traffic can frustrate shoppers and lead to poor reviews.

Not Updating Keywords ‚Äì Trends change, and so do popular search terms. Regularly refresh your keywords based on search trends and analytics.



---

Final Thoughts

Placing the right keywords in your product listings is essential for boosting visibility, attracting buyers, and increasing sales. By strategically using keywords in your title, description, tags, and images, you can improve your rankings on search engines and online marketplaces. The key is to keep it natural, relevant, and aligned with how your target customers search.

My husband is away on a business trip for two weeks, in a time zone 8 hours ahead. He‚Äôs winding down for the night and I‚Äôm in the middle of my day after both children have boycotted naps. 

My 3 month old and 2 year old are screaming. One is wanting a bottle, the other is wanting me to play with him, he‚Äôs gotten an applesauce pack out of the fridge and is actively smearing it in his hair. The 3 month old is screaming and arching to the point she‚Äôs going to throw herself off of the bouncer. The 2 year old is pulling things down off the counter and throwing them, my husband is trying to talk to me and get me to be all excited he‚Äôs coming home. I‚Äôm ecstatic, but right now I‚Äôm overwhelmed, overstimulated, overtired, anxious, depressed, burnt out, and literally feeling insane. 

We‚Äôre on FaceTime and I‚Äôm venting to him. Telling him how hard all of this is, why moms keep lying to each other that this is worth it, feeling like I‚Äôm failing, trying to etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve had on average 3 hours of sleep each night he‚Äôs been gone. Last night I have a stretch from 3:30-8‚Ä¶ the night before that, I got 3 hours non-consecutively. We were also stuck in the house for  36 hours because it was -2 where I live. 

He decides that he‚Äôs pissed off and going to ‚Äúwithdrawal‚Äù or ‚Äúgo quiet,‚Äù on FaceTime because he‚Äôs not getting his happy go lucky, lovey dovey wife. Well guess what, I‚Äôm one thrown gummy away from needing a straight jacket. So he throws a tantrum bc‚Äî‚Äî- after a long hard day of working, going to the bathroom by himself, eating in peace, showering in peace, going to the bathroom in peace, drinking a coffee that doesn‚Äôt get spilled, not hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù 1000‚Äôs of times, not hearing ‚Äúall done‚Äù 4000 times, being able to walk into a store without hearing ‚Äúbye bye‚Äù 7000 times and a baby screaming to get out of the car seat‚Äî‚Äî he decides to throw a tantrum because our kids meltdowns and my being busy, mid anxiety attack, and pure exhaustion isn‚Äôt what he wants. 

I proceed to ask him what‚Äôs wrong‚Äî already knowing what‚Äôs wrong because this is a recurrent issue‚Äî him not getting attention the way he wants and throwing a tantrum. And he tells me that I vented and didn‚Äôt stop for a long time, that I‚Äôm not acting happy that he‚Äôs coming home, that I‚Äôm giving him ‚Äúwhiplash‚Äù for not being so happy and lovey dovey like always‚Ä¶ 

I wrote him litters everyday for a week, sent sexting messages, sent pictures, valentines comes and the letters stopped (the whole point was to ask him to be my valentine in a different way every time) but I kept writing sweet messages. Some nights I just honestly got too tired and the messages would be short bc I would literally fall asleep writing them. But I sent a lot of little things about missing him and being excited he‚Äôs coming home‚Ä¶ 

He literally caused a fighting in the middle of my kids screaming and me freaking out because of the kids. The proceeded to gaslight me and say it was my fault that I reacted this way to him getting upset for not having my attention‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ do you hear the children screaming??? Did you hear what I told you they did all day?? Or that I‚Äôm functioning on little to no sleep???? Do you see me about to lose it???? No, okay cool. 

Zero empathy.

To top it all off, I fell down the stairs after we hung up. I keep getting hurt after we fight, I‚Äôm starting to think he‚Äôs putting hassid on me tbh. ",4,1740018179.0,MuslimMarriage,0,1.0,False

Samesun Ocean Beach

ITH Mission Beach

ITH Beach Bungalow

Grind size. I currently have a subscription with a local roaster that has 2 options: drip and French press.

***Summary:*** Indiana Jones finds himself thrust into a race against the forces of Fascist Italy in 1935 in a search for the famed Spear of Constantine, said to contain the power to forge empires. Following a path set by Napoleon back at the end of the 18th century, Jones' travels take him to Malta, Egypt, Lebanon, and Cyprus as he teams up with the Vatican and Egyptian allies to stop Colonel Vittorio Ferretti and other conspirators from acquiring the Spear and using it to unleash a wave of conquest upon the world. 

**Episode 1**: ***The Search Begins...***

Set in the fall of 1935 in Fascist Italy, famed Italian treasure hunter and recently promoted Colonel **Vittorio Ferretti** leads a group of Blackshirts (fascist paramilitary) to raid an old monastery. There, they find the manuscript they are looking for, revealing that their search is for the famed spear of Emperor Constantine, rumored to give power in battle, could be fruitful, as there seems to be strong evidence that the spear was taken from monastery by Napoleon during the French Revolution campaign in Italy towards the end of the 18th century. The priest tells them that Napoleon too sought the relic by raiding churches, but was unsuccessful, just as Ferretti will be. Ferretti tells him that he will succeed, and kills the head monk, ordering the remainder of the monks to be killed. However, one monk survives and makes an escape.

In Vatican City, the Commander of the Swiss Guard, **Matthias¬†von Amsler**, along with his lieutenant, **Heinz Kappler**  is briefed on the raid of the monasteries, with the escaped monk sitting before him sharing details of the attack. Von Amsler learns that the Blackshirts were after information about the Spear of Constantine, and sends for Father **Marco Conti,** the Vatican's foremost historian on the time period. Conti, von Amsler, and Kappler discuss the seriousness of the situation, noting Mussolini's desire to overthrow the Vatican and forge a new Roman Empire. Conti says they're going to need to recruit some additional help.

As class dismisses at Marshall College, Professor **Henry Jones Jr.**, aka Indiana, is wrapping up class when a figure slips into the back of the classroom. As class ends, it is revealed that it is Marco Conti, and the two greet each other as old friends, with Indiana apparently being close with Conti's now deceased son during time at a British boarding school the two attended. Conti quizzes Jones to make sure he's still on top of his game when it comes to Napoleon's campaigns, which Conti then hints were actually rooted in a desire to find a relic of great power, the Spear of Constantine. Jones counters that it is a myth, and Conti says he believes it's real, and that Mussolini is searching for it, and now the Vatican needs Jones' help to beat them to it. Jones agrees, and Conti informs him that they will need to return to the Vatican archives to determine their next steps.

Flying to Rome, Jones and Conti are met by Swiss Guard Lt. Commander Kappler at the Archives, informing them that the Vatican has made this an urgent task, and thus appointed Kappler to assist them in whatever way necessary. Jones and Conti begin to look into the diaries of an old monk who worked with the Knights of St. John to smuggle several treasures out of Malta before Napoleon and the French could find it. This leads them to determine that there may be more information to discover in the crypts beneath the old castle on Malta.

The crew boards a ship to take them to Malta, but on the ship, Conti discovers that Ferretti and several of his Blackshirts are on-board with them, forcing the crew to remain hidden and avoid being seen by them, as Conti and Ferretti are familiar with one another. Jones, Conti, and Kappler manage to slip away from them initially, but are discovered as they undock, leading to a chase scene in the harbor docks that sees Jones and crew escape, but now with the Blackshirts alerted to their presence on Malta.

The trio arrives in Malta and makes their way to Fort St. Angelo, meeting with a British officer overseeing the fort. He initially denies them access to the crypts, and then kicks them out when they further attempt to gain access. Later that evening, Jones and Kappler sneak into the Fort, and make their way down to the crypt. There, they find clues indicating that the spear was indeed in Malta, and that the Knights of St. John may have used an inside member of Napoleon's naval force to smuggle it out during his expedition there in 1798, thus suggesting that it would have almost certainly ended up in Egypt.

As they attempt to make their way out, they find that Ferretti and the Blackshirts have indeed followed them to the fort, and thus a shootout occurs, though with the noise alerting the British soldiers, forcing the Blackshirts to flee before they're able to apprehend Jones or Kappler. Jones and Kappler meet with Conti and inform him they're off to Egypt.

**Episode 2:** ***The Library of Alexandria...***

Back in Rome, Mussolini, and several generals are briefed by Col. Ferretti, with Mussolini becoming irate that he failed to acquire the Spear instantly, and now notes that the Vatican, and likely the British are now onto them. Mussolini informs Ferretti that he cannot fail again, and assigns several members of the OVRA (Fascist Italy secret police) to join his unit and ensure their success. Ferretti mentions he does have a lead on where Jones and crew are headed next, noting that he will have the unit heading to Egypt that evening.

Jones, Conti, and Kappler arrive in Cairo, and immediately head to meet with Dr. **Leila Anwar**, a colleague of Dr. Jones who specializes in the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt. As Indiana fills her in on what they learned about the Knights of St. John smuggling the spear with a French admiral, Dr. Anwar says she knows that there is a logbook from that ship here in Egypt, which may contain additional information about where the Spear might have ended up once it landed in Egypt. However, she says that the logbook is part of a private collection, owned by Greek shipping tycoon **Dimitrios Kazanis**, who is an Orthodox extremist who would be unwilling to work with agents of the Vatican, though Anwar suggests they might have other ways to access the logbook.

The four of them head to Alexandria. Conti sets up in a safe house there, while Jones, Kappler and Anwar infiltrate a party being thrown at Kazanis' estate. However, one of Ferretti's OVRA agents is tailing the group and discovers Conti's location. He brings two additional agents with him, and sneaks up on Conti, knocking him unconscious and taking him from the safe house.

Meanwhile, Jones and crew attempt to sneak off to the library wing of the estate, but find it's heavily guarded. Kappler causes a distraction, creating a chance for Jones and Anwar to sneak in. They rifle through the pages of the logbook, attempting to figure out which box it likely would've been stored in, with Jones finding a series of boxes listed with Latin coding on them, a likely sign of use by the Knights order. They find that the shipment was sent off to Avaris, an Ancient Egyptian city that was only a site of old ruins during the time of Napoleon's invasion. Confused as to why Avaris, Jones and Anwar attempt to search the book further but are discovered and held at gunpoint by members of Kazanis' guard.

Jones, Anwar, and Kappler are all tied up and held in the library until Kazanis can enter, revealing that he intends to sell this information to Mussolini, stating that he, like Mussolini, would do anything to bring upon the downfall of the Catholics and the Vatican. However, Jones is able to break free and a fight breaks out leading to a lantern being knocked over and starting the library on fire. Jones and Anwar end up getting separated from Kappler, and nearly are taken out by a fierery beam that falls from the ceiling. They manage to find their way out, and escape the party as the fires engulf the estate. They don't find Kappler however.

**Episode 3:** ***The Avaris Descent...***

Jones and Anwar return to the safe house to find it has been ransacked. While they are trying to figure out where Conti went, they hear someone attempting to unlock the door, instead kicking it down. Jones ambushes the man, knocking him on the head with a frying pan, only to see it is actually Kappler, himself also returning after finding a way out of the now burned down estate. They quickly wake him back up, only to notice that the Blackshirts must have staked out the safe house after kidnapping Conti, as several Italians with guns are seen approaching. The group quickly escapes and makes their way out.

They make it to a British hotel on the other side of the city, and debate what to do with Conti captured and his whereabouts unknown. Kappler insists they must abandon him and find the Spear before Mussolini's soldiers can. Jones insists they need to find him in order to solve some of the missing pieces in this search, and says he knows someone who can help them and that they will meet him in the morning. Jones and Anwar exchange some flirty looks as they part to separate rooms, with Jones doubling back and being welcomed into Anwar's room for the evening.

In the morning, they head to a dig site project outside of Alexandria, where Indiana Jones introduces Dr. Anwar and Kappler to **Sallah el-Kahir**, the finest excavator in all of Egypt, and another friend of Jones'. Jones fills Sallah in on their situation and he mentions that he knows that the Italian consulate had, that morning, begun exerting pressure on the Egyptians to take over a dip site at Avaris, meaning that Ferretti is already aware of the clue pointing towards Avaris, and that they might be able to accomplish both tasks of finding Conti and making progress on finding the Spear. Sallah also mentions that he can get them into the site, as his company has been contracted by the Italians to oversee a new excavation.

As Sallah helps them infiltrate the site, Jones, Kappler, and Anwar discover that Father Conti is being held in one of the tents on the outskirts of the camp, and sneak in and rescue him, as he reveals that the Italians believe they have located the chamber that Admiral Jean-Claude had sent the boxes off to. However, the group inspects the logbook further and discovers some clues suggesting they have the wrong spot, and that there is another chamber where the French had stored supplies.

The four of them then attempt to gain access to the underground chamber, but find it is booby-trapped, and the room begins to fill with sand. Jones is just able to avoid a horrible death for the crew by reaching the external lever through a crack in the ceiling, releasing the sand and unlocking a second chamber that takes them down deeper.

In the second chamber, they find two relics, an old leather journal as well as a golden chest bearing the insignia of the Knights of St. John. Anwar notices the insignia on the journal and swipes it into her satchel before the others notice it. Jones and Conti goes to investigate the chest, but stops when he hears a gun click behind him, turning around to find himself held at gunpoint by Kappler, who is revealed to be a double agent who is actually working with Mussolini to overtake the Vatican, noting that it is only through Mussolini's force of will that Italy will become a power once again, not the ridiculous religious non-sense of the Pope. Ferretti and the Blackshirts arrive and take the golden chest, opening it to reveal that there is nothing but some old bones in the box. Angered at another non-discovery, Kappler and Ferretti decide not to shoot them, and instead trigger an explosion which collapses the the door to the chamber and leave them stranded in there with no escape.

**Episode 4:** ***The Order of St. John***

Jones, Conti and Dr. Anwar are still trapped in the chamber, and attempt to find a way out but are unable to do so immediately. However, Jones notices an odd pattern on one wall and finds he can actually use a small stick of dynamite he had in his bag to blow open a hole in a different wall, as he and Anwar shield themselves on the other side as the explosion goes off. They enter into the new room and discover another passage out, as the crew eventually makes their way out of the ruins.

After getting out, Anwar reveals the journal she swiped, from one of the French admirals who was secretly a part of the Order of St. John and they turn through it to discover that the Spear was smuggled out of Egypt after the invasion, and that it has likely ended up in the Balkans, but exactly where is unknown, though they do have a lead. At that point, the group has a debate on whether or not to continue pursuing it, or leave it be since Kappler and Ferretti don't have a lead. However, Jones admits that he now really feels like the Spear exists, as people do not go to such massive lengths to hide and move something that doesn't exist. The group decides to double down on their search and heads to Albania to connect with a colleague of Dr. Anwar's. Conti sends a telegram back to Rome with updates.

Back in the Vatican, the Pope (whose name remains unused in this series) meets with Swiss Guard Commander von Anslem to hear the latest news on the search. The Pope tells Von Anslem that he is concerned about Mussolini acquiring the Spear, yes, but that he also fears what those in the Apostolic Palace might even do if the Spear arrives there, noting that Mussolini has a significant spy network, even within the church. The Pope tells von Anslem he needs him to find a much more secluded place for the Spear to go if it is ever found, as its power is too tempting for most men.

Ferretti and Kappler arrive in Naples, but are quickly approached by an agent who informs them that there is an urgent telegram from them. They read the note and are then quickly shuffled off to a cafe where they meet with an Austrian professor who is sympathetic to Mussolini's cause, Dr. **Hans Volk**, who brings them a piece from his personal collection, who indicates that the Spear was taken to Beirut, though where in the city is unknown. Kappler proceeds to head to Beirut with Volk, while Ferretti also receives word from his spies in Rome that Jones is headed to Albania, and says he will follow Jones and ensure he is dealt with.

As Jones, Anwar, and Conti arrive in Albania, they make their way to an old Crusader fortress on the coast, and begin exploring through the ruins. However, they soon find that the fortress is not entirely abandoned, as several armed men appear around them, living in seclusion in the catacombs beneath the church. Jones discovers that the men are the actual Order of St. John. As they begin to ask about the Spear, the leader of the Order, a man named **Ahmet Noli**, warns them that they exist to ensure the Spear remains hidden and that they will not allow Jones to continue his search. However, it is then that they hear the firing of artillery, as an assault on the fortress by Ferretti and his men begin.

Noli and the Order of St. John spread out and begin firing back on Ferretti and the soldiers he's with, as Jones, Anwar, and Conti join the fight. However, the Italian forces begin to overwhelm the Order, and so Jones and crew, along with Noli, turn to escape into the woods, being forced to use an inflatable raft to try and evade Ferretti's forces, who also use rafts down the rapids. Jones' crew ultimately escapes, finding shelter in a local village after dispatching the Italians pursuers in the rapids.

**Episode 5:** ***The Trail of Constantine***

In Beirut, Volk and Kappler arrive on scene and meet with a local sheikh, **Farid al-Masri**, as they request the use of some of his territory to excavate for a project, promising money and even political support for his desire to overthrow the French rulers of Lebanon. He agrees to the deal, and Volk and Kappler get to work excavating a piece of land in the hills just outside Beirut.

Jones, Anwar, and Conti make their way out of the forest and begin to question Noli about the Spear, arguing with him that they need to find the Spear before Mussolini's forces do. Noli says he cannot, due to his oaths, reveal the place he believes it to be located, but does say that Jones would be wise to continue his search by following the trail of Constantine. Jones and crew head to Istanbul as a result.

Jones, Anwar, Conti, and Noli arrive in¬†Istanbul, where they seek out a¬†Byzantine historian\*\*, Dr. Elias Karavelis\*\*, who specializes in Constantine‚Äôs relics. Karavelis initially refuses to speak with them, fearing repercussions from both Mussolini‚Äôs spies and Turkish authorities. However, after Jones shows him the old journal that they have discovered from the Order of St. John, Karavelis realizes they are on the right track.

Karavelis explains that¬†Constantine once moved sacred relics between the cities of Berytus (Beirut) and Constantinople, likely using the old¬†cistern network beneath the Hagia Sophia¬†for safekeeping. They descend into the¬†Basilica Cistern, navigating ancient tunnels filled with Byzantine iconography. Along the way, they¬†solve an inscription puzzle¬†leading them to an ancient¬†archbishop‚Äôs crypt, where they uncover a partially burned manuscript detailing the¬†final resting place of the Spear‚Äîan old monastery near Beirut, once used by Bishop¬†Eusebius, Constantine‚Äôs close religious advisor who is recorded as having baptized Constantine into the Christian faith.

The group explores the cistern networks and does indeed find the confirmation they are looking for, a painting hidden in a secret vault below the city that shows the Spear in what is clearly a Lebanese monastery.

Back in Italy, Von Anslem meets with Cardinal **Vincenzo Belluzi,** whom he is making preparations with to send off the Spear to an isolated monastery in Cyprus where Belluzi's brother is currently assigned. However, Belluzi is somewhat nervous about it, noting his fear of Mussolini's spies and his increasing hostility towards those in the Vatican working against Mussolini's attempts to expand his power.

Ferretti is met in Tirana by Italian general **Luigi Ricci**, one of Mussolini's top generals, who informs Ferretti that Mussolini is outraged and wants Ferretti recalled from the mission, likely to be stripped of his station, demoted, and possibly even banished for his failures. Ricci, however, tells Ferretti that he is going to let him go, but heavily implies that should Ferretti be successful, he should bring the Spear to Ricci rather than Mussolini, as Ricci is the one standing by him, noting that Mussolini is too blind to his weaknesses to lead Italy to the greatness it desires.

**Episode 6: The Battle of Beirut...**

Jones, Anwar, and Conti arrive in Beirut and debate what to do. Anwar wants to go to the French magistrate of the province and enlist their help, but Conti argues it's too dangerous to enlist them right now, as he fears that the French might just very well desire to seize the Spear themselves. Jones suggests the best course of action would be to find a list of all the known monastery locations in and around Beirut and begin narrowing them down.

The group heads to the French University of Beirut, meeting with Dr. **Jacques Leblanc**, who aides them in their search for the monastery sites, but then also reveals that he has heard of a renewed excavation happening in the hills outside Beirut at the spot where it was believed there used to be an old monastery that was largely collapsed in on itself. Jones and co. thank Leblanc for his assistance, though Leblanc becomes somewhat suspicious of their intent despite their answers that they are just here for research for a potential dig.

Spying on the camp from a different hill nearby, Jones and co. confirm that it is certainly Kappler running the organization, and question who the German with him is. Conti confirms that it is Hans Volk, a member of the German Nazi party, and that his presence spells trouble. However, before they can formulate a plan, several French soldiers arrive behind them, with a French commander, **Robert Dubois**, and Leblanc arriving, confirming Leblanc's suspicion that Jones was not simply here for a research project.

Kappler and Volk are overseeing the exacavation of the monastery, and soon gain access to the vault. They enlist some local Lebanese diggers to assist in breaking open the door. Kappler sends several of the Lebanese workers in ahead of them to check for traps, with his suspicion being confirmed as two of the workers are killed by traps. However, that seems to be the extent of it, as Kappler and Volk enter in behind them. They notice that one of the tombs seems to have been set more recently than the others, which they speculate would line up with the Order of St. John hiding the spear in the late 1790s/early 1800s more so than the older, less disturbed tombs.

Kappler takes a hammer to the tomb stone, breaking the wall there open to reveal a shining golden spear, ornately decorated. Kappler grabs the Spear, and feels a surge of power running through him whilst holding it. He pivots quickly holding it and accidentally triggers it, seeing a wave of fire explode from the edge of the Spear, melting one of the walls of the stone with Greek fire, confirming the power of the spear. One of his lieutenants rushes in and tells him that there are French soldiers approaching their camp however.

Dubois, after hearing Jones' story, orders his unit to attack the illegal Italian excavation camp and ensure they cannot acquire the weapon, and orders Jones, Anwar, and Conti arrested, as they are handcuffed and placed in one of the trucks.

The French soldiers attack the camp, exchanging fire with the Sheikh's soldiers and some of the Italian soldiers there. The French appear to be winning, until Kappler emerges from the hill and unleashes the power of the Spear which rips through the French line with fire, killing dozens. The fire causes some explosions, and one ends hitting the van that Jones and co. are in, knocking it over.

Jones escapes from his handcuffs which broke off as the truck, and quickly frees Anwar and Conti, who agree they need to make a play for the spear before Kappler and the Italians can leave the battlefield with it. They sneak around the excavation site as some of the French soldiers rally and attack again. Jones and Conti make it close enough to Kappler unseen as Jones uses his whip to snap the spear out of Kappler's hands and send it flying. He leaps off the ledge and begins fighting with Kappler, who attempts to draw his gun and fire on Jones. Jones disarms Kappler, and is forced to choke him out as Kappler attempts to draw a knife on Jones. As Kappler dies, Jones releases his grip, only to realize that Kappler had hit Conti in the gut. Conti bleeds out and dies, telling Indiana that he needs to ensure the Spear doesn't end up in the wrong hands.

**Episode 7: Who to Trust...** 

The battle continues on as the French soldiers drive out the Italians and Lebanese forces from the site. Before Jones can recover the Spear, Volk rushes forward ahead of him intent on acquiring it first. Jones and Anwar chase after Volk, leading to a brutal fight on the side of the hill with some of the monastery outcroppings from it. Volk, though not as physically imposing as Kappler, is cunning and ruthless, using the terrain and dirty tricks to his advantage. As they struggle, Volk manages to grab the Spear and tries to wield it, but unlike Kappler, he hesitates. The weapon‚Äôs power is unstable, and when he attempts to summon fire, the blast is uncontrolled, setting the ruins ablaze. Jones and Anwar barely escape as Volk is engulfed in the inferno.

Jones and Anwar grab the Spear, but ensuring Jones keeps it wrapped in some cloths and such to ensure the power doesn't begin to channel through him. They make their escape, avoiding the remaining French soldiers as well, and make their way back to Beirut. 

With the Spear in hand, Jones and Anwar debate what to do with it, debating whether or not to entrust it to the Vatican, and risk Mussolini's forces apprehending it as they attempt to sneak it into the heart of Rome, or find somewhere to dispose of it or hide it. However, they are met in Beirut by none other than Matthias¬†von Amsler, the commander of the Swiss Guard. He tells them that he has arranged for safe and secretive passage for them back to the Vatican, and informs them that the Pope has ordered him to help find a more secure place for the Spear, as the Pope doubts the security of the Vatican given all the spies. Jones and Anwar agree to accompany him back to the Vatican and to help ensure it doesn't fall into the hands of Mussolini's forces.

Jones and Anwar press von Amsler as to where the Spear will end up, and he informs them that he and Cardinal Belluzi have arranged for it to end up at a quiet, hidden away Franciscan monastery in Cyprus. Jones says he'll need to gauge Belluzi's trustworthiness before he hands it over, to which von Amsler agrees. He says Belluzi will meet them in Nicosia in two days, and so they board a ship to head to Cyprus. 

Meanwhile, in Nicosia, Belluzi is sitting outside at a cafe, reading a paper and drinking coffee when General Ricci pulls up a chair at the same table. Ricci informs him that Kappler, Ferretti, and Volk have all failed, but that the plans to remove the Pope will proceed nonetheless, per Mussolini's instructions. Belluzi then mentions that he has made arrangements that will still procure them the Spear, despite the failures to actually seize it, as Belluzi mentions that he manipulated von Amsler into bringing the Spear directly to him. Ricci is surprised to learn the Spear will be in Nicosia the next day, and asks Belluzi what he intends to do with it. Belluzi smiles and informs Ricci that he does not intend to wield it himself, but rather knows that *whomever* wields it, certainly could ensure he is the new Pope, with a prominent role leading a new Roman Empire to glory alongside the Roman Catholic Church. 

Ricci understands the implication, and informs him that Mussolini is a bit too anti-religious, and would use the Spear to obliterate the Vatican just as soon work with them. Belluzi then asks Ricci his opinion on the church's value as an ally, to which Ricci responds that he finds the idea of an alliance there to be very valuable. Belluzi tells him that it is then settled, he will acquire the Spear, Ricci shall remove the current Pope, and at that point, Belluzi will become the new Pope, and then give Ricci his blessing to expand Italy's borders, declaring a new Crusade against global apostasy. 

**Episode 8: The False Prophet**

Jones, Anwar, and von Amsler arrive in Nicosia under heavy secrecy. With Belluzi‚Äôs duplicity unknown to them, they prepare for the handoff at a secluded monastery outside the city. However, Jones remains suspicious. He pushes von Amsler about Belluzi‚Äôs loyalties, but the Swiss commander insists that the Cardinal has always been a staunch defender of the Church. Jones, unconvinced, decides to investigate further before surrendering the Spear.

Meanwhile, Belluzi and General Ricci finalize their coup. The Pope‚Äôs removal is already in motion, with the orders going out to begin removing some Vatican officials who are antagonistic to the fascist cause. Belluzi‚Äôs ambition is no longer just to wield power from behind the throne‚Äîhe intends to be the throne. With the Spear, he will declare himself the rightful leader of Christendom and endorse Ricci‚Äôs conquest under divine authority.

As night falls, Jones and Anwar secretly follow Belluzi to a clandestine meeting with Italian officers. Overhearing their conversation, Jones confirms his worst fears: Belluzi plans to present the Spear to a powerful figure who will wield it on his behalf, ensuring his rise to the papacy. However, before Jones and Anwar can slip away, they are caught. Ricci and his men take them prisoner and seize the Spear.

Jones and Anwar are bound and brought to the monastery, where Belluzi, draped in ceremonial robes, prepares a grandiose ritual. Ricci stands by, intrigued but skeptical, watching as Belluzi proclaims the dawn of a new Holy Empire. He grasps the Spear, expecting power to surge through him, but nothing happens. Confused, he demands to know why it does not respond to him as it had to Kappler.

Jones, now unbound after managing to slip free during the distraction, steps forward. He reveals that the Spear only responds to those with conviction in their own dominance‚ÄîKappler had no doubts, only ambition. Belluzi, despite his arrogance, still sees himself as a servant of a higher cause, making him unworthy. Ricci, seeking his opportunity, steps forward and takes the Spear for himself. At first, nothing happens‚Äîbut then, the power ignites. Fire ripples along the shaft, and Ricci, realizing what he holds, turns on Belluzi.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your blessing anymore,‚Äù Ricci sneers, before impaling Belluzi through the chest as the flames shoot forward and begin to burn. 

With chaos erupting, Jones and Anwar break free, engaging Ricci‚Äôs men in a desperate fight. Von Amsler arrives with a handful of loyal Swiss Guards, having uncovered Belluzi‚Äôs plot just in time. A battle ensues in the monastery courtyard, with Ricci, empowered by the Spear, tearing through his own men in his madness. The fight spills into the catacombs beneath the monastery, where ancient tunnels stretch toward the sea.

Jones, realizing they cannot let Ricci leave with the artifact, devises a desperate plan. He and Anwar lure Ricci onto a crumbling stone bridge over an underground river. As Ricci raises the Spear to strike, Jones fires his revolver‚Äînot at Ricci, but at the bridge supports. The stone gives way, sending Ricci plunging into the abyss below, the Spear vanishing beneath the rushing waters. Anwar nearly falls in herself, but Jones catches her by the arms and pulls her back up. 

Von Amsler, mourning the betrayal of Belluzi, solemnly declares that the Vatican must be purged of corruption, and intends to return to Rome to ensure this cannot happen again. He thanks Jones for his service, offering him a place among the Vatican‚Äôs secret protectors, but Jones declines, saying he'll be returning back to Marshall College until the next adventure that awaits him. 

As dawn breaks over Cyprus, Jones and Anwar prepare to part ways. Anwar, ready to return to Egypt, warns Jones that relics of power will always attract those who seek to control history and that the Italians aren't the only ones caught up in a desire for power. Jones smirks, and tells her he knows all too well. The two hug, and Jones boards a ship bound eventually for America, the morning sun casting long shadows behind him as he disappears into the horizon.

**Final Scene:**¬†Deep beneath the monastery, water flows through ancient tunnels. The camera pans through the darkness, settling on a single glint of gold resting among the stones‚Äîthe Spear, waiting to be found again.

üò©Lies and betrayal on our anniversary? Unbelievable! üò°üíî

""You've undergone IVF six times to conceive this child, Ms. Caldwell. Are you sure you want to give up? Is Mr. Spencer okay with this?""
""I'm sure he'll agree."" Callista Caldwell's voice is hoarse after a sleepless night. She's never felt more awake, though.
""I'll schedule the surgery for a week from now, then.""
It's Callista and Luther Spencer's wedding anniversary in a week. This is good‚Äîshe can end things where they started.
After booking her flight out of the country, she places her hand on her abdomen. There's a blossoming life in there.
She's looked forward to this for the past five years. She never would've expected to give up on it before it could happen.
Chapter 1
The phone pinged again, showing the same trending topic that had been circulating for half a month.
Luther Spencer had spent a fortune on a luxurious estate. He had planted an entire garden of roses by hand to celebrate his fifth wedding anniversary.
Once again, he announced to the world that his heart belonged solely to Callista Caldwell.
Countless comments followed, and each of them was expressing envy for their love.
""Who says relationships with an age gap don't work out? Mr. Spencer's ultimate wedding gift is his hopeless devotion. It's said Mrs. Spencer is six years older, and it took him three years of relentless pursuit to win her over.""
""Everyone knows Mr. Spencer adores his wife. Two years ago, when Mrs. Spencer was trapped during the earthquake, Mr. Spencer risked his life to rescue her.
""He was covered in injuries when he was finally pulled out, and yet he was more set on comforting his terrified wife. The news even showed him holding her, and both of them were in tears.""
""And last year, when a media outlet mocked Mrs. Spencer for her age and claimed she couldn't have children, Mr. Spencer sued them into bankruptcy.
""He even made a public statement saying he didn't care whether they had children or not, but he would never allow anyone to hurt his wife over it.""
Callista couldn't help but force a bitter smile as she read these comments.
Luther truly did ensure no one could hurt her. Yet every pain she ever felt was dealt by him.
When Callista first confirmed her pregnancy, she had been eager to share the good news with Luther. But then she received a message from an unknown sender.
It was a photograph of a pregnant woman.
The young woman's smile was radiant as she posed for the pregnancy photograph. Meanwhile, Luther knelt beside her. He was reverently kissing her rounded belly. His face was filled with joy and contentment.
Tears streamed down Callista's face.
The ultrasound image she had suffered through six rounds of IVF to obtain now felt like a cruel joke.
On their wedding day, Luther had sworn he would love only her for the rest of his life. But it turned out the so-called ""rest of his life"" lasted only five years.
If that was the case, Callista decided she no longer wanted Luther in her life. And her child would not be born into a web of lies.
The door creaked open. Callista's tear-streaked, blood-shot eyes met Luther's, and he immediately panicked.
""What's wrong, honey? What happened? Don't cry‚ÄîI'll fix it.""
He glanced at the ultrasound image on the table. Without looking too closely, he pulled her into his arms.
""It's okay if the IVF didn't work. Even if we never have kids, it doesn't matter. Having you is enough for me.
""Shh, don't cry anymore. It hurts me to see you like this.""
Callista gave a smile that looked worse than crying.
This man was such a hypocrite.
His child with someone else was about to be born, and yet he was saying this to her face.
Luther didn't notice the change in her demeanor and continued comforting her. ""Cally, our anniversary is in a week. I've planted an entire sea of roses for you and prepared blue fireworks. I'll set them off for you to see, okay?
""Isn't blue your favorite color?""
Callista stared at him blankly. She was still smiling even as tears rolled down her cheeks.
It seemed he didn't remember. She had never liked the color blue.
""Then, in a week, I'll give you an anniversary gift too,"" she said.
Luther's eyes lit up with excitement as he carefully wiped away her ""tears of joy.""
""Honey, I can't wait. I'm looking forward to your surprise.""
Callista silently stared at the ultrasound image.
She hoped that when the time came, Luther would truly be surprised.
Chapter 2
At noon the next day, Luther took Callista to the Spencer residence for lunch.
Luther's mother, Jane Dawson, never liked Callista. She didn't even bother to show up on their wedding day.
After the marriage, Luther moved out with Callista, only visiting his family at the end of each month.
""Honey, whatever it is that my mom says later, don't take it to heart. I'm always on your side. We'll leave right after lunch,"" Luther reassured Callista while holding her hand.
The moment they stepped through the door, Callista heard Jane's laughter.
""Oh, such a sweet baby! Those tiny hands and feet just melt my heart.""
Callista turned pale, and her feet were rooted to the ground. She recognized the woman sitting next to Jane‚Äîit was the same woman from the pregnancy photo.
""This is my friend's daughter, Wren Kirk,"" Jane introduced.
""She's pregnant, and her family's overseas, so they asked me to take care of her. I just took her to her prenatal checkup this morning.""
Jane linked arms with Wren and approached them. She handed Luther an ultrasound photo with a meaningful glance.
""Take a good look. Doesn't the baby resemble the parents?""
A flicker of panic crossed Luther's face as he responded with a faint warning in his tone, ""Mom, stop joking around. How would I know? This is my first time meeting Wren.""
Jane cast a glance at Callista and then pushed Wren forward. ""Well then, let me properly introduce you. Wren, this Luther.""
Wren's cheeks turned pink as she said, ""Hey, Luther.""
Luther gave a slight nod, then pulled Callista closer with one arm. ""And this is my wife. Callista.""
""Nice to meet you, Callista,"" Wren said softly.
Callista felt utterly numb. Her hands that were hanging by her sides began to tremble uncontrollably.
So, the entire Spencer family knew about Wren. She was the only one kept in the dark.
""What's wrong?"" Luther immediately grew concerned.
""Are you feeling faint from low blood sugar?""
He quickly retrieved some candy he always carried with him, unwrapped one, and brought it to her lips.
Callista opened her mouth mechanically. Though it was candy, all she could taste was bitterness.
Luther instructed the housekeeper to start serving the meal. He was still holding her hand as they sat down.
""You barely ate breakfast. Have more for lunch,"" he said gently.
Callista silently picked up her glass of water, but Luther swapped it out for a warm one.
""Your period's coming soon. You shouldn't drink anything cold, or your stomach will hurt again.
""The prawns today look good. Let me peel some for you.""
Luther barely ate throughout the meal as he was constantly tending to Callista and ensuring her plate was never empty.
""Luther is so good to his wife. I'm honestly jealous of Callista,"" Wren suddenly remarked. ""I love prawns too. Luther, could you peel some for me as well?""
Wren slid her plate toward him, but Luther acted as if he didn't see it.
""If you want prawns, peel them yourself. I only peel them for my wife,"" he replied.
Callista took a sip of the warm water while suppressing the urge to retch. ""Give them to her. I don't want any.""
Luther froze for a moment, then playfully pouted like a child.
""Fine, I'll eat them myself. Cally, how could you give away the prawns I peeled for you?""
Callista's eyes glinted with sarcasm. They'd already slept together, yet they still pretended otherwise.
Jane set her utensils down with a dark expression. ""Callista, wasn't this your sixth IVF failure? Since Wren is here, why don't you get some tips from her?""
""Mrs. Spencer, I don't really have much experience myself,"" Wren replied. She blushed as she shook her head.
""My boyfriend and I conceived on the first try. It just happened to be my birthday, so maybe being in a good mood helped.""
""Well, my daughter-in-law here is ten years older than you. She's not really comparable to you,"" Jane said with a mocking tone.
""I'm planning to let Wren move into the house so I can take better care of her. Plus, maybe her luck will rub off, and I'll have a house full of grandchildren soon.""
The moment she finished speaking, Luther cut her off firmly. ""I don't agree.""
Jane's gaze turned even colder as she looked at Callista. ""Why not? Just because someone here can't conceive, they just can't bear to see others succeed either?""
""Are you done?"" Luther's voice was icy.
""Mom, if you're determined to make me stop coming here altogether, then by all means, keep going.""
""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause trouble."" Wren stood up with teary eyes and hurried away.
Luther instinctively took a step forward as if to chase her but stopped himself, realizing how inappropriate it would be.
""I'm done,"" Callista said coldly as she watched the drama unfold. She stood and left without hesitation.
The moment she walked out of the Spencer residence's gates, a notification appeared on her phone‚Äîa verification message from Wren.
""March 5th is my birthday. That was our first time. He didn't let me leave the bed all day.""
That day, Callista had suffered her fifth IVF failure. She hadn't eaten or drunk anything and had locked herself in her room for an entire day and night.
When she finally gathered the strength to open the door, she'd found Luther disheveled while sitting outside her room. She had even pitied him and comforted him.
As it turned out, Luther had just rushed home from Wren's bed.
How ridiculous. How tragic.
She endured endless injections without complaint for five years. Yet now, the pain in her chest was unbearable, making it hard to breathe.
""Why are you crying, honey?""
Luther had followed her out. Seeing that her face was streaked with tears, he panicked and instinctively glanced at her phone.
Chapter 3
The phone screen dimmed automatically. Luther didn't pay much attention to it and pulled Callista into his arms. He gently patted her back.
""Shh, don't cry. It hurts me to see you like this.
""It's my fault. I shouldn't have brought you here just to upset you. She's my mother‚Äîyou don't have to put up with her for my sake.
""You can yell at me or hit me if it makes you feel better.""
On the way home, Luther spent the entire ride trying to comfort her. Callista simply closed her eyes and pretended to sleep.
Occasionally, the sound of message notifications echoed in the car. Luther was busy replying to them for the second half of the drive.
When they arrived home, Luther stroked her head.
""Honey, there's an urgent matter at work that I need to handle. Wait for me here, and I'll come back early tonight, okay?""
Callista quietly got out of the car.
After Luther left, she accepted Wren's friend request and opened her social media feed. Pinned at the top of her profile were two photos.
The first was of Luther's back as he planted roses. The second was a sea of blue roses.
The caption read, ""Considering someone took the time to plant my favorite blue roses, I'll forgive you this once. Come and make it up to me.""
Callista's chest tightened at the sight. So Wren was the one who loved blue. Even the roses he planted for their anniversary weren't for her.
She hailed a cab and went straight to the estate. As soon as she arrived, she saw Luther's black Bentley parked nearby.
In the distance, Luther stood with his back to her in front of the sea of roses. He was unaware of her presence.
""If Callista could have children, I wouldn't have needed you. She's where I draw my line. How dare you show up in front of her and throw a tantrum?""
Wren's eyes brimmed with tears. ""Then why come to me at all? Just leave me alone!""
""Don't cry,"" Luther said. His tone softened. ""As long as you behave, I'll take care of you for life.""
Wren wiped her tears and smiled before throwing herself into his arms. ""I can be even better if that's what you want.""
""I cleared an entire afternoon for this. Do you really not know what I want?"" Luther's voice was hoarse as he scooped Wren into his arms and carried her toward the estate.
Just then, Wren glanced back and smirked at Callista. She had seen Callista standing there the whole time.
Through the windows, shadows of their entangled figures swayed and flickered. Callista stood frozen on the roadside. Her chest was heaving with every labored breath.
It felt like a barbed hook had torn into her heart, and each pull left behind a fresh, bleeding wound.
""Are you here to take pictures too? Mr. Spencer and Mrs. Spencer still have such a loving relationship after all these years. It's really enviable,"" a woman nearby remarked with a smile as she snapped some photos.
""Mrs. Spencer must have saved the galaxy in her past life. Every woman dreams of having a husband like Mr. Spencer.""
Callista laughed bitterly as tears streamed down her face. ""But she doesn't want him anymore.""
This so-called estate Luther gave her, symbolizing his devotion, was nothing more than a place where he slept with another woman.
The woman then stared at Callista and became somewhat stunned. It wasn't surprising she'd mistaken Wren for Callista.
After all, Wren bore an uncanny resemblance to Callista at 24, the year she first met Luther.
""I guess men are all the same,"" the woman murmured. Her tone turned despondent.
""At least Mr. Spencer is somewhat decent. He probably just wants a child too badly, even going so far as to find someone who looks just like you.
""Why not let it go? Pretend you don't know. Life will go on as usual.""
""It wouldn't be the same,"" Callista said quietly.
The fact that Luther sought out a woman who resembled her didn't make her feel grateful; it only made her feel disgusted.
After leaving the rose garden, Callista went to the hospital and collected pre-procedure medication for an abortion.
She placed the medicine on the coffee table and stared at it for a long time. She was still overwhelmed by a suffocating ache.
Suddenly, the door burst open. Luther rushed in with his shirt buttoned unevenly. He tripped and nearly knocked over a chair in his haste.
He scanned her from head to toe with a pale face. ""Honey, why did you go to the hospital?""
Chapter 4
Callista's medical card was linked to Luther's phone number, so the notification about her visit and prescription was sent to him.
""Honey, say something! You're scaring me,"" Luther pleaded anxiously.
Callista handed him the bag of medicine, and she lied, ""The doctor suggested I try a new medication. It might improve the success rate of the next IVF attempt.""
""As long as you're okay, that's all that matters. You scared me to death.""
Luther didn't even glance at the bag and casually placed it on the coffee table.
Callista let out a cold laugh.
In the past, he would always meticulously read the instructions no matter what medication she was prescribed as he was worried about potential side effects.
He used to say he couldn't bear the physical pain of IVF for her, but he needed to remind himself that she was suffering for his sake.
Now, she had personally handed him the pre-procedure medication for an abortion, and he didn't even bother to look at it.
The unfamiliar scent of perfume mixed with the aroma of roses in the air made Callista feel nauseous, and soon, her stomach began to cramp. She clutched her abdomen in discomfort.
""Is it your period?"" Luther leaned in, trying to warm her stomach with his hands.
Callista swatted his hand away.
""The smell on you is disgusting,"" she said bluntly.
Luther sniffed himself and chuckled.
""It's probably the scent of roses. I've been going to the rose garden several times a day, trying to make sure everything is perfect for our fifth anniversary. I'll go shower and change my clothes.""
But earlier, he'd said he was going to the office.
Callista couldn't be bothered to expose his lie and simply replied, ""Alright.""
After Luther left, Callista picked up her phone.
For the past five years, her social circle revolved entirely around Luther, leaving her with no close friends of her own.
If she were to leave him, there weren't many people she needed to inform, except for her younger brother, Kai Caldwell. Kai was also her only remaining family member.
But as she stared at his number, she couldn't bring herself to call.
Kai held Luther in high regard as his brother-in-law, and she worried it would complicate things. It was better to wait until she was ready to leave.
That night, Luther lay beside her while gently massaging her stomach.
""Honey, I've delegated all my work for the next two days. Your first couple of days on your period are always the worst, and I can't leave you alone.""
Callista gave a nonchalant response, not taking his words to heart.
Then, a notification sound woke her up in the middle of the night.
""Sorry, did I wake you? There's some work I need to take care of. I'll put my phone on silent. Go back to sleep, honey,"" Luther said softly.
Callista kept her eyes closed, but she was no longer sleepy.
Luther's left hand continued massaging her stomach, while his right hand was free to reply to messages. The warmth of his touch and the occasional low chuckles he couldn't suppress felt like a dull blade cutting into her, one stroke at a time.
""Honey?"" he whispered, testing the waters.
As he hoped, Callista didn't respond.
Luther withdrew his hand, quietly got out of bed, and tiptoed out of the room. Even as he moved silently, his eagerness was palpable.
""How dare you send those kinds of pictures over? Just wait‚ÄîI'll make sure you can't get out of bed tomorrow,"" he muttered before the door clicked shut.
Moments later, Callista's phone buzzed several times. It was a message from Wren.
""Are you getting old and unattractive, Cally? Luther's been so pent up that he couldn't get enough of me this afternoon.
""He even said he wanted to try something new with me tonight. Can you believe it? He has no consideration for this poor pregnant woman.
""Honestly, I feel bad for you. Luther did plenty of the work to make me pregnant. Meanwhile, you're stuck with sterile IVF procedures, and you still can't conceive.""
Even in the bedroom that was warmed by the heater, Callista felt frozen to the core.
She got up, retrieved a hot water bottle, and climbed back into bed.
For five years, she'd believed she had met Luther too late in life and that their time together would be too short.
But now, with only five days left, she found the time to be unbearably long.
Chapter 5
Callista went to bed late and woke up late as well. As she stepped out of the bedroom, Luther came through the door while holding a bag in his hands.
""Honey, I bought your favorite honey garlic prawns,"" he announced while presenting the package as if it were a treasure.
""I rushed back to keep them warm for you. Eat them while they're hot.""
In the past, whenever Luther upset her, he would buy honey garlic prawns to cheer her up.
Callista never particularly liked them, but she always forgave him‚Äînot because of the prawns, but because she loved him.
What was this gesture for today? Was it to ease his guilt after spending the whole night with another woman?
""Honey, did you see the message I sent before I went out? When did you wake up?""
For some reason, Luther felt a vague unease over Callista's recent demeanor.
""No, I just woke up,"" Callista replied as she picked up her fork. She wouldn't let herself go hungry because of him.
When he saw her calm expression that seemed to have no trace of anger, Luther finally relaxed. ""I'll take care of some work first. When you're done eating, I'll join you for a walk.""
Callista continued eating while opening her phone.
Wren had just posted a new update.
""He spoils me so much. I casually mentioned wanting honey garlic prawns, and he immediately went out to get them for me.""
Attached to the post was a photo of a bag of the honey garlic prawns‚Äîthe same ones Callista was eating out of.
Meanwhile, Luther let out a soft laugh across the table. Seconds later, a new comment appeared under Wren's post.
Luther replied, ""It's good that you're self-aware.""
Not long after, Jane chimed in with her own comment.
""Of course, he should spoil you. Just tell us whatever you want. You're a hero‚Äînot like someone else who takes up space but can't even conceive.""
Jane's comment was visible to Luther as well.
Callista glanced up. She was curious to see his reaction. He didn't seem bothered at all. In fact, he was wearing a smile. His expression was filled with warmth and contentment.
Callista chuckled to herself. She pulled up Jane's profile and blocked her on all platforms in one swift move. She had been wanting to do that for a long time.
Before Callista could finish breakfast, Luther's phone rang. It was Jane.
Her sharp voice practically burst through the speaker, and Luther frowned as he looked at Callista.
""Mom said she wants to bring you some herbal medicine. Did you block her?""
""There's no need. I'm not drinking it.""
Jane had a habit of sending her strange, bitter herbal remedies, none of which were helpful. Callista had forced herself to choke them down over the years, only to endure Jane's passive-aggressive remarks about wasting her kindness.
""But you can't just‚Äî""
Even if Jane couldn't send her messages anymore, the old ones were still there. Callista slid her phone across the table toward Luther.
The most recent message from Jane read, ""A woman who can't have children is worthless. You couldn't even keep the one you managed to conceive.
""You're such a failure. I won't allow the Spencer family lineage to end with you.""
Callista had been pregnant once in their first year of marriage.
But the baby's heartbeat suddenly stopped at seven months, and she was forced to undergo an induced labor.
Jane had made countless remarks blaming her over the years.
Callista, however, knew Luther had always tried to mediate and spoke up for her in front of his mother. Not wanting to make things harder for him, she had never brought it up.
But this time, Luther frowned at Callista.
""She's still my mom. You should try to understand her a little,"" he said.
""And who's supposed to understand me?""
Callista retorted with a cold laugh. ""Luther, you know how devastated I was back then.""
""But have you ever considered that there might have been a reason for the miscarriage?"" Luther sighed.
""Maybe you ate something you shouldn't have, or perhaps you used the wrong cosmetics‚Ä¶""
Tears spilled down Callista's face instantly.
""Don't cry,"" Luther said. He realized that he had said the wrong thing. ""I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.""
During her first pregnancy, Callista had been more careful than anyone else. She hadn't worn makeup even once, avoided eating out entirely, and refused to travel anywhere far.
When she lost the baby, her entire world collapsed. Luther stayed by her side every moment, never leaving her alone, and took care of her 24/7.
He had reassured her over and over. ""Honey, it's not your fault. Even if we never have children, it doesn't matter. You're all I care about.""
Luther was there for an entire month. He had pulled her back out of the abyss.
But now, she finally understood. He also believed it was her fault the baby didn't survive.
Chapter 6
""I'm sorry. You can hit me or yell at me. Just don't cry,"" Luther pleaded as he pulled Callista into his arms.
""I was spouting nonsense. I deserve whatever punishment you give me.""
Callista couldn't free herself from his embrace, and her tears continued to fall. But deep down, she knew the truth.
Luther hadn't simply misspoken; he was trying to shift all the blame onto her, to justify his infidelity as something inevitable.
Luther grew increasingly remorseful as he said, ""I'll make everything clear to my mom. You can consider unblocking her once she learns to respect you, okay?""
Tears streamed down Callista's face, but she smiled bitterly. Little did he know, there was no future for them anymore.
For the next two days, Luther stayed home to keep her company. Even though Callista barely acknowledged him, he busied himself with cooking all her favorite dishes.
Meanwhile, Wren's social media was filled with updates.
Baby supplies Luther ordered for Wren had arrived. He had booked a top-tier postpartum care center for her.
There were even specially prepared meals for expectant mothers, delivered personally by Luther. And he had left a ""like"" under every post.
That evening, as Luther brought her water for a foot soak, his phone rang.
""It's your brother,"" he said, putting it on speaker. ""He said he just landed a big client and is celebrating. He wants us to join.""
Kai's voice came through the line. ""Hey, Cally, it's been ages since I've seen you. Come with Luther, okay?""
With only two days left before she planned to leave, Callista didn't know when she might see her brother again. Hence, she couldn't refuse him.
""Okay.""
Kai had arranged a small barbecue gathering in the Caldwell residence's backyard.
When Callista and Luther arrived, Kai greeted them warmly.
""Cally, I know you don't like the smell of smoke, so I had them put all the cigarettes away. Pretty thoughtful of me, right?""
Before Callista could reply, someone nearby exposed him. ""Liar! It was Luther who reminded everyone to put the cigarettes away.""
""Luther truly treats Callista like a queen,"" another teased.
""He has to! Otherwise, why would I accept him as my brother-in-law?"" Kai laughed.
Luther rolled up his sleeves and started grilling Callista's favorite meat.
""My wife deserves everything good in life,"" he declared.
""Honey, sit here. Don't let the smoke bother you. Tell me what you want to eat, and I'll grill it for you.""
Callista stayed silent as she was not in the mood to play along.
Suddenly, Kai spoke up. ""Luther, we're out of drinks. Come help me grab a few cases from the basement.""
Luther patted Callista's head gently. ""Wait here, I'll be right back.""
As soon as they left, Callista's phone buzzed with a location pin from Wren. She was at the Caldwell residence too.
Callista's heart clenched. Fearing Kai might act impulsively, she got up and followed them. But the tense confrontation she had imagined didn't happen.
Instead, she saw the three of them standing together, chatting and laughing.
Wren looped her finger around Luther's, and her tone was playful as she said, ""Your son's been kicking me a lot. He must miss his dad.""
""Luther, I'll leave you two to it. I'll grab the drinks myself."" Kai grinned mischievously, and he walked off to give them space.
As soon as he walked away, Luther pulled Wren into his arms. ""So, only my son misses me?""
""You already know the answer to that,"" Wren teased.
Luther chuckled, kissing her as they headed into a room‚ÄîCallista's childhood bedroom.
Callista's blood ran cold, and her legs nearly gave out beneath her.
She thought back to when her parents passed away in an accident. She had only been 13, and she had begun juggling school and multiple jobs to support Kai.
For her brother, she had taken on every dirty, exhausting task imaginable.
Kai had cried so hard as he walked her down the aisle on her wedding day. He was barely able to speak through his sobs.
""If Luther ever bullies you, come home, Cally. Your room will always be here for you.""
But now, the two people she loved most had joined forces to deliver the cruelest blow.",2,1740017664.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

My list kind of makes me sad and realize how small this condition has made my life become.

Here‚Äôs mine:

1) Drink coffee again. As soon as I can, I‚Äôm buying myself an espresso machine as a botox success gift. Also really looking forward to spending a Saturday morning at my favourite coffee shop.

2) Start writing again. I used to enjoy creative writing, but by the time I am done work in the evening I am so bloated, sick and in pain that all I can do is lay in bed a lot of the time.

3) Go out for dinner, and then do something else afterwards. This is such a challenge for me right now. If I do go out, I need to go home and lay down afterwards. I am so excited to go to get a drink, ice cream, the symphony, whatever and not have to worry about it.

4) Take the train to a nearby city to visit my best friend for a day. I can technically do it now but it‚Äôs so hard, because by the time I‚Äôm on my way home, I‚Äôve blown up like a balloon.

5) Go to a wine bar. I stopped drinking any alcohol because it makes my symptoms worse. I am not a huge drinker, but a glass of wine again would be nice.

6) Go out after work. My after work hours now are just me suffering. I am so excited to go out with my coworkers, go on a date, whatever.

7) Buy new clothes. I have an impossible time buying pants that fit me because of the bloating. I have to pretty much exclusively wear Uniqlo‚Äôs Easy Pants (an RCPD saviour, if anyone is curious because they look like normal pants but have an elasticated waist).

8) Work out regularly without feeling so sick/in pain that it‚Äôs impossible/difficult.

9) Join a local book club/knitting club and meet new people.

10) Leave Toronto. I came here for grad school and stayed because it was easier to find a job, but I‚Äôm ready to leave for suburbia now. Don‚Äôt know if I could juggle a new job while feeling so awful, so excited to find a new position and get out of here.

okay so I 21 F and my current close friend 21 F.
We were friends since college started (2020) but we r get closer in early 2024 . We got quite fine friendship. Until I got a boyfriend. I always met with her like 7/24 but when i got a bf it become 2-3 times a week. but i always make sure to see her, talk to her everyday bcz ion want her to feel left out.

Basically;
My bf does theatre and at summer he had a exam to get in to theatre school. But my friend called (at the exam me and his family was there to support him) she said ‚Äòi am going to vacation 5 days later, i need you to look after my cat. Can you get him?‚Äô And i said ‚ÄòI am at my bf‚Äôs exam rn but i can get him tomorrow‚Äô 

Note: I got 1 dog and 1 cat (who hates everyone) 

She hunged up the phone to my face. I couldn‚Äôt understand. 

She called again and said ‚Äòu have to get him rn.‚Äô and i said ‚Äòi cant cuz i am not available rn but i can get him tomorrow.‚Äô later that week i got him and take care of her cat for like 3 weeks she didn‚Äôt gave me litter of cat food. 

then the drama started i guess..
She called me again in summer she said ‚Äòi am going to vacation 2 hours later, my mom doesn‚Äôt know so i am coming your home because you need to pack my stuff and gave me sum bikinis.‚Äô I was at my bf‚Äôs house to study 

And i said that. She cursed to me like you are bad friend you dont care about my stuff etc..
I said if she called me yesterday i would help but she called me 2 hours before???

Then one day she said these stuff 
‚ÄòI asked you to get my cat and u were at your bf‚Äôs exam, i said pack my stuff and u were at your bf‚Äôs house to study. Am i not important? my situations was more important than a exam, u r literally selfish bitch.‚Äô

THEN‚Ä¶ I was going to my bf‚Äôs soccer game tomorrow, she called me and asked me what r you gonna do tomorrow and i said i am going to my bfs soccer game if she wanna come we can go together.

She said yes. Then asked what time was the game and i said 7pm . She said we can meet up early hang out then we can go to the game. 
I accept but i said we gotta be there at 6:30pm i promised to my bf‚Äôs mom to get her.

She got a tantrum. 
She said ‚ÄòU R ALWAYS LIKE THAT I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR TIME I DONT CARE ABOUT GAME. WE SHOULD HANG OUT AND WE CAN GO WHEN THE GAME ENDS. I DONT WANT TO WATCH SOCCER.‚Äô 

we got in to a fight. I said that was my plan, i invited her to join with me, if she doesnt wanna come to watch, we cand hang out before and i can go to game by myself. I explained to her many times. AND MY LAST STRAW WAS Valentines Day.

She said what r we gonna do in valentines and i said  me &my bf r gonna get coffee, go to mall and make some dinner at his house. She said ‚Äòno u will be with me or i am not gonna speak w u‚Äô 
I said ‚Äòbabe its our first valentines w my bf‚Äô 
She said ‚Äòhahaha i bet its a cheap coffee, you guys are allways go to mall thats boring lol, hahaha i bet u r gonna cook some cheap ass noodles ahahahah‚Äô 

I was like wtf? anyways i didn‚Äôt answer any of that messages

later that night at valentines me and my bf were sleeping and my phone rings.
Guess who was calling? 

Yeah she was. 

I picked up and said ‚Äòhello? its 3am lol‚Äô
she said ‚Äòyeah where are you i am coming.‚Äô
I said ‚Äòdude i am at my bf‚Äôs house why?‚Äô and she said ‚Äòwell my mom thinks im with you and i was at some boys house. But he got some things to do. I need to sleep at your house.‚Äô 

I said ‚Äòim at bf‚Äôs and why did u lie to ur mom dude she texts me‚Äô I checked my phone and her mom was texted me that if she was w me 

She said ‚Äòanyways u clearly not available for me. I guess i need to sleep at streets. Forget about it!‚Äô then hanged up
.. 

I spoke with her many times but ion know. Am i the problem or she makes me think that i am the problem 
How can i politely cut her off because i dont want her to feel upset. there is many thing that she did that i didn‚Äôt write but when i try to talk to her she is always be rude and cursing throwing tantrums etc.",1,1740017294.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1itnejk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itnejk,Laage9/Lakia's aura strategy has to be studied,"*This is gonna be a long one, please bare with me and thanks for reading*

Hello me fellow riders, I've been making my way through Gavv and finally reached the point where I can start talking about a certain character(or at least about his intro). This is Lakia, and why his aura strategy has to be studied.

You're probably wondering, hey isn't usually the win conditions that need to be studied. Well You're right that is usually the case, but Lakia is a demon that comes every 5 years or so. Especially with a super sentai season on his beltüòÇ.

Time for a flashback, I'm just watching episode 11(I think) and drinking water as we cut back to the granute dimension. We see peeps buying snacks from a stomach inc stand(really interesting to see granute economy) and after the family leaves that when someone shows up. The fella who shows up is a cra- I MEAN! He's a sugar addict, feeling for some dark treats. Needless to say he gets pulled aside for mentioning the black market goods and then gets told sorry we ain't got none right now...But you can work for some.

So poor Lakia-kun is taken, strapped to a table, and given that disgusting gavv implant. They then send him on his first job, probably thinking okay letssee how long the new kid last. Let's just say, he brought home some stacks that first day.

Lakia gets tossed into the human world, bag on his head so he can't go back home and immediately gets to work. He goes to a courtroom in the middle of a trial and takes a seat. It was like he was watching them, out of curiosity. Then after a while he said, ""This show is garbage"" he stood up and immediately showed his true form. The court began screaming, and what do you think Lakia did. Did he attack them No, did he say a cheesy villain line No, did he just walk out No. He quite literally put a smile on every face in that room. 

Lakia's power is like a Jelly fish, his toxins have a pleasure effect. Like putting someone on slight laugh gas, which causes them to be in a state where they don't even know their about to get snatched. On his first day, this man nabs 20 people. Due to the people not being in a state of fear, the quality of the spice is good not to mention the number. On his first day this man already has the higher ups glazing him.

Then there's his second crash out. Lakia decides to see a movie, he heard Sonic 3 was fire. After thirty minutes of sitting and no Keanu Reeves he realizes he's in the wrong room. He's in the wrong movie, the plot is lame, the family with the crying child is pissing him off, the normie with his girlfriend is irking him, and on top of all that. His popcorn has no butter. So Lakia says, ""This movie is garbage"" and does the worse thing anyone can do. He gets to the front of the screen, and normie says HEY GET OUT THE WAY! Lakia responds by taking his mod out, ""Want a movie, I'm the main event"". 

The crowd goes AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! one minute and aaawwwwww the next. This man iced a movie theater, what's worse it's confirmed later that there was a worker in there on top of the 40 movie goers. Lango and the other siblings are beyond impressed with Lakia so much that they even give this man a whole box of dark treats. We're talking a box of 6 of them, the most we've seen the plebs get was 1 or 2. Lakia has me pulled in at this point he finally got his coveted snacks, how will this man eat them. Remember this man was feeding for them, so what's he about to do. 

He sits on his comfy couch, cracks open the box(probably filled with treats made from his own victims), and he smirks only to throw the box to the side. Now I'm like wait, didn't you want those. So now I'm thinking wait, did you fake gooning for those blocks just to become farmer. I'm completely invested in this guy, feels like the last time I was invested in a villain/anti hero like this was watching Desast in Saber. Alright Lakia, show me how you do things and he preceeded to do just that.

What I didn't mentioned before was that Nylev is actually working with Suga, I KNEW HE WAS WEIRD! Mind you Suga knows he's a Granute, and this man gave him pudding. If you watch Saiki K. you already know pudding(or rather coffee jelly) is a snack for sophisticated people. The look he had when he took a bite, Nylev had a brain blast. 

Which then brings us to the judas contract of sorts. Nylev makes Lakia an offer, mind you Lakia is playing Lango right now and slowly getting closer to his overall goal. Nylev however tells him he can give him what he's looking for faster and that brings us to the main exhibit.

Shoma and Hanto are about to clean up a Granute, only for a man who looks like Kiramei Silver to enter the stage. After some small talk, Lakia shows the riders his real form and right before Hanto can pull out his electric chair Lakia gives his retort. He pulls out his driver almost like he was telling the riders, ""You riders are garbage"".

The Vram henshin, is was nostalgic for me. My first kamen rider was build, I was looking for Ex-aid and found it instead. So when I saw Vram with his Kamen Rider Grease like Henshin, I nearly stood up and shouted THE KING IS BACK! I almost destroyed my laptopüòÖ.

That said, speaking of Kamen Rider Grease, he quickly made his presence known. This man hit a ground pound and juggled Hanto and Shoma, we even get a camera shot of them falling to the floor. Hanto's bloodlust reaches his peak and he tries to box with him, and Vram immediately shows the importance of having one toku series under his belt. He beats the axe out of Hanto's hand, and I'm sitting here like Yo don't beat him with the gift Shoma gave him. This demon throws the axe to the side, and proceeds to play kick ball with Hanto. Hanto's sliding, screaming, and Vram hits the electric slide. I'm sitting here expecting Hanto to get the Robin special, but instead Vram hits him with the Think Mark Think pose. I honest to God started laughing.

Then that laughter turned to a gasp, when Hanto swung at him and Vram took a seat on him. Hey I thought you were Kazumin, not evolt! 

Shoma goes in for the save, and does some decent work but Vram's parrys are no joke. Then Vram decides to pull a Michinaga and Revs Gavv's blade onto himself, the disrespect of this man. The villain of the week even spoke up and said YEAH THAT'S MY BODYGUARD RIGHT THERE! Even the prey is clowning you guys, the mooks are supposed to be afraid of heroes. 

Interesting introduction check, hidden motives check, excellent work ethic check, crazy powers check, respect from higher ups check, embarrassing current heroes check. Most importantly, the aura recorded from all current actions, as immaculate as the spice he collected. Goes without saying I'm locking forward to watching Lakia perform.

So how do you feel about Lakia and how he was introduced? Did you think he was gonna be special upon first notice or did you think he was gonna be a one off villain?

I feel women also have a threshold for me as I am 6‚Äô4‚Äù and make great money for my age. I also go to the gym and run regularly. I was with my friends the other night at a game night and we were playing a card game where you had to guess something about another person. One of the girls said I was probably the richest person there (I have no doubt that is true). And I said, I mean yeah, probably, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt show my wealth other than wearing a branded pullover. In fact, I‚Äôm afraid to buy a luxurious car I can very much afford that I like because I don‚Äôt want women to see me as a wallet - they can ride in my old Honda with the patched armrest. I just do brewery or coffee dates for first dates as well - I don‚Äôt want to impress you with a fancy dinner.

I am not just attracted to looks as well. I find I really enjoy having conversations with women and conversation skills to be very attractive. Intelligence is also super attractive to me, and aggressiveness/forwardness as well. Some of the things that are real turnoffs for me are nose piercings, lack of education, smoking/vaping, being overweight, or being very short since I don‚Äôt want my future kids to get bullied in school. I‚Äôm not attracted to women over 6‚Äô because I feel like they‚Äôre too masculine for me. 

Just wondered if this is acceptable or biblical. Also, Christian women, what do you look for in a man? Strong identity in Christ, strong financially, strong mentally, and strong physically regardless of occupation? What else do you look for?

Hi guys!

I started to develop a crush on the maintenance guy that works at my bosses apartment (I just got this job). I‚Äôve briefly met him 2 years ago with my dog. He suddenly asked me about him because my dog happens to have one eye. I‚Äôve seen him around, especially because I live on the same block as my boss. He‚Äôs usually cleans outside the apartment & I used to walk there with my dog, but then stopped bc I got way too shy. Anyways I now get to see him a bit more often in the apartment because I dog sit and have to take the dog out to the patio. He‚Äôs usually cleaning and at times we have said hi to each other and had a small brief chat one time. I unfortunately am a nervous and shy person, so I sometimes walk past by him, which I hope doesn‚Äôt come off as rude (I know it does :/). Since he‚Äôs usually vacuuming and mopping, I don‚Äôt want to interrupt him. I would like to get to know him a bit better throughout my time there (I won‚Äôt be there too long as the puppy is scheduled to go to daycare when he‚Äôs ready). I really need help in gaining confidence to say hi to him more and even ask him how he is. I one time planned to kindly offer him coffee since he works so much (might seem too flirty too). I could really use some advice on how to approach him more and be confident. As of now, I practice starting a conversation, especially in Spanish since he doesn‚Äôt really speak English.

I've gotten pretty proficient with it - mastered puck prep (RDT, WDT with MHW 3Bomber Yu, Normcore leveler/tamper) and can pull some great shots. However, I'm hitting some limitations:

* Temperature/pressure stability issues with back-to-back shots
* With identical puck prep and very fine grind setting, I get inconsistent results: about 1 in 6-7 shots hits that sweet spot for light roast (50s extraction, no channeling), while others run faster (\~30s) with lower extraction
* No pressure/temp feedback from the machine

I mainly drink iced lattes (3 doubles daily), so steam power isn't a factor.

Looking at two potential upgrades (both need new 58mm accessories):

1. Flair 58 (\~$1000 investment)

* Pros: Full control, temperature stability, pressure profiling
* Concerns: Manual operation fatigue? Daily workflow with 3 shots?

2. ECM Puristika (\~$2000 investment)

* Pros: Build quality, temperature stability, pressure gauge
* Concerns: Maintenance requirements? Worth the price jump?

Is either upgrade really worth it? BBP's 3s heat-up time is pretty unbeatable - I can go from wanting coffee to having one in under 5 minutes. I know both Flair 58 and ECM will pull better shots, but how significant would the improvement be? Workflow matters a lot to me.

im a full-time college student in my senior year and working on the side. recently i got let go from an office job because they ""thought i was prioritizing school over my work"" (which is insane because i was a top producer, employee of the month, worked there for 2 years, and also why the fuck would i NOT prioritize my literal education?). since then i got a job at a cafe and my god i dont know how people do this for decades. 

on my first day a guy yelled at me because he ordered a diet coke and then decided he wanted a coffee instead after i had already rung it up, had a manager pat me and call me a ""good girl"" for cleaning (a female manager, surprisingly), and this was all after i had barely received any training. this is the only job that is willing to work with my hours and i had applied to about 50 positions prior. i spent the whole day running around and guessing how to do tasks and then getting scolded for not doing them correctly. 

i have worked since i was 16 years old, starting in food service, so i know how bad it can be. but for some reason i thought things might have gotten better or that maybe this place would be different. i have no option but to keep working because i need to become financially independent. does a ""good job"" even exist? everyone i know is drowning, either financially, emotionally, or both. getting written up for defending themselves, working two jobs to make ends meet, etc.

I've spent the past couple weeks combing through other threads, YouTube videos, etc. and trying everything I could, and I still have yet to get a single tasty shot out of this thing.

My full setup:

* **Machine:** Breville Bambino Plus
* **Grinder:** Baratza Encore ESP (tried with and without RDT)
* **Other tools:** WDT, Normcore dosing funnel (to prevent spillage during WDT), Normcore spring-loaded tamp, Normcore bottomless portafilter, IMS 18-22g precision basket, Normcore puck screen. I use a scale to weigh my dose and yield to the nearest tenth of a gram, and time my output.
* **Water:** Third Wave Water Espresso profile, 1 packet per gallon.
* **Beans:** I've tried multiple across a range of roast and quality levels - a lighter roast from a random specialty roaster, Intelligentsia's Black Cat Espresso blend, Illy Classic Roast from the grocery store, and [Creamery blend from Ruby Roasters](https://rubycoffeeroasters.com/products/creamery-seasonal-blend) (more on that one later...)

I've tried just about every possible combination of the following:

* Grinding finer, a click at a time until it chokes the machine, or grinding coarser until my flow is clearly too fast
* Playing with different ways of pre-heating my portafilter and machine for maximum extraction (blank shots, steam wand, etc.)
* Increasing/decreasing my dose, I think I've tried everything from 14-22g in various baskets.
* Pulling longer shots, ranging from probably \~28-60g out
* Using different beans - I've heard that the Bambino does better with darker roasts.

Most recently, I went to a caf√© and ordered a shot made with the Ruby Roasters blend I mentioned before (at least I think it was that one - I no longer have the bag), and bought some of those beans to bring home. This way, I'd know what the coffee was ""supposed"" to taste like as a frame of reference. The barista even gave me the ratios they use so I could try to replicate them at home - 19g in, 36g out in \~30-35 sec.

The shot I had in the caf√© was really tasty - sweet, balanced, full-bodied, with a pleasant fruity acidity. Went home and dialed in what looked like a perfect shot - 19 in, 36 out in 35 sec. Consistent flow with no visible signs of channeling or anything. Came out looking thick and rich. And yet, I still can't drink it without making a face and getting overwhelmed by that strong, unpleasant acidity in the back of my throat.

The band consists of five permanent members, including percussionist Larry Graves, tenor saxophonist John MacLean, guitarist Paul MacDougall, bassist Liam Smith and lead singer Johan Hultqvist, as well as loosely affiliated musicians, including jazz musicians such as Kevin Turcotte, Richard Underhill and Brian O'Kane. The band is known for their bicycle-powered outdoor concerts. Their songs often contained political content.

The band was formed in 2003 by Graves and MacLean, who were childhood friends. The name Mr. Something Something is a play on the song ""Mr. Follow Follow"", by early afrobeat performer Fela Kuti, who has influenced the band's vocal style. Graves, MacLean and Hultqvist began writing music for the group. In 2004, they put out their first self-titled album. 
The band's second album The Edge was released in 2005. It was nominated for a 2007 Juno Award in the World Music category. The 2007 release Deep Sleep was a collaboration with spoken word artist Ikwunga, an Afrobeat Poet. Deep Sleep was a frequently played world music album on Canadian college radio in 2007.
In conjunction with International Car-Free Day 2008 Mr. Something Something presented Canada's first bicycle powered concerts at the Evergreen Brickworks in Toronto's Don Valley and outside infamous bike thief Igor Kenk's defunct bicycle shop.
The band's album Shine Your Face was released in 2009. That year the band toured around Canada, including a performance at the Guelph Jazz Festival.

My mother was a serial collector of old things and instruments, which is why, for a while, there were two pedal organs in the basement of the house I grew up in. My friends and I would sometimes try to see who could pedal faster and, therefore, play louder.

Nobody has ever marketed a pedal amplifier, so Mr. Something Something invented one. The Toronto Afrobeat band regularly plays shows run on electricity generated by fans pedalling stationary bicycles.

The band's touring gear includes several large batteries and a generating stand with room for 10 bicycles. The bikes charge the batteries, which run the amps, providing steady power for the band even if several people stop pedalling at the same time.

Playing off the grid, as Mr. Something Something has done intermittently for the past year, has given singer Johan Hultqvist a new feeling for the links between people and power, and between performers and audiences. The fans pumping away to keep his microphone running, he said, symbolize the feedback relationship of musicians and listeners, and demonstrate a kind of freedom that we need to cultivate more.

""We don't tend to consider the real cost of our electricity, because we don't produce it ourselves,"" Hultqvist said, over a coffee near his home in west Toronto. ""If you get on a bike to produce power, you realize that there is some kind of sacrifice required for anything to happen. But you're not having to rely on a supply system that's out of your control, and that could break down. The closer your source of power, the more likely you are to feel empowered, and to feel free.""

Drummer Larry Graves came up with the bicycle idea, after Mr. Something Something played a wind-powered show at the farm of Michael Schmidt, the Durham County dairy farmer who became something of a celebrity last winter when he was prosecuted for selling raw milk. An Israeli heavy-metal band had already experimented with the pedal-power concept, and an inventor in New York state had developed a generating stand.

The stationary bikes have sometimes met with resistance in unexpected places. The band was setting up to play at the Green Living Show at the Canadian National Exhibition last spring when a building inspector and fire marshal appeared, and told the players (including guitarist Paul MacDougall, saxophonist John MacLean and bassist Liam Smith) that their generating system posed a fire hazard.

""The irony was that we ended up having to play on the grid at the Green Living Show, though we were there to showcase new technologies and what's possible,"" said Hultqvist with a smile.

He shares in the band's songwriting with Graves and MacLean, providing most of the lyrics for their buoyant, rhythmically gnarly tunes about urban tragedies and dreams of better worlds (their latest album, on World Records, is called Shine Your Face ). He's also the main spokesman for the band's gentle activism, which has taken Mr. Something Something to organic farms, food co-ops and other places where bands don't normally play.

The 33-year-old, Swedish-born singer said he probably would never have become an active environmentalist if he had not emigrated to Canada, where it takes so much energy just to get around the country. He experienced an epiphany on that score while touring in Western Canada, at the moment when the van made yet another fuel stop and several empty plastic water bottles tumbled from his open door.

An initial stay for a few years in the late nineties ended when his first band imploded just after getting a demo deal with Sony. He returned eight years ago, and became a keen supporter of what he regards as a cultural explosion in his Toronto community. For the past three years, he has presented a monthly series of readings and performances by musicians, writers, comedians and activists at Caf√© Tinto on Roncesvalles. Compared with Sweden, where institutions and their ways are more deeply entrenched, Canada seems to him a place of limitless possibility.

Hultqvist and his fianc√©e, the jazz pianist and singer Elizabeth Shepherd, dream of getting off the grid permanently, by finding some land and building a self-sufficient green dwelling, along the lines promoted by the American architect and ""garbage warrior"" Michael Reynolds. Maybe it will include a retrofitted barn, Hultqvist said, for performances, dances and other forms of communal creativity. Once you give up centralized solutions to power generation, every place can become a centre.

1itmxrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1itmxrf/an_art_school_that_didnt_teach_anything/,An art school that didn't teach anything.,"I noticed a painting school near the community college I attended. I've always wanted to go into painting, but never felt good enough.

At first I thought the classes and teacher was great- I was learning a lot of things. I chose to go on a weekend class thinking it would be nice to start the morning with a hobby.

As my school timetable changed, I realised it would be better for me to attend a weekday class and I asked to change.

The whole time, the teacher smelt of horrible coffee breath- I never judged, I just held my breath.

The teacher made it about him and how I didn't like the other teacher, which was true- he kept talking about himself and didn't teach me anything- I struggled a lot. But guess where this assistant teacher learnt it from? The head teacher.

Because I participated in his class, it meant I drank coffee or smoked something- the teacher wore a black mask, and apparently that meant dealing drugs or something.

Celebrities wear black masks, do they deal or do drugs? I don't know, who cares?

I stopped going because I felt like the teacher kept trying to make drama and a story out of something. And I'm sad that my parents participate in it.

My mom wears clothes that she thinks I used to wear, and did drugs I didn't have.

Anyway, I don't care. A sham art school is a sham art school. People who are interested in participating in rumors mean they don't have a life of their own. I found out the teacher was talking a lot because he had all these insecurities about himself- yuck.

I don't need to go to art school, but it would be nice to meet similar minded people and receive actual guidance from qualified teachers.

I also went to a local art shop to buy some pencils for drawing. I was treated like I was buying drugs instead. Fuck you all. ",1,1740015920.0,Rants,0,1.0,False

He and I have been together for over 12 years and married for 5 of those years. 
While we were eating, his ex girlfriend walked in with her step-dad and sat at the table next to us and he almost didn‚Äôt recognize her. He eventually went over to say hello and make sure it was her as he hasn‚Äôt seen or spoken to this woman in over 12 years. 
She ended up leaning over to talk to us a bit, updating us both about things going on in her life. She‚Äôs had a lot of struggles in her life including a not so great childhood, drugs and alcohol addiction, jail time, and had her 2 daughters legally taken away and so on. She told us that she‚Äôs recently been living in a sober house, been sober for a year, and seems to be doing a bit better. The whole interaction was fine and she was very nice.
Today during dinner, my husband said he had something he wanted my opinion on. He said was thinking a lot about that interaction last night and has felt so bad for her. They apparently used to be close friends outside of when they dated in high school but again, he hasn‚Äôt spoken to her since before we started dating back in 2012. 
He told me he thinks she needs someone to talk to or an acquaintance or something. I responded immediately with ‚ÄúNot you specifically tho, right?‚Äùand he gave me a look that said otherwise and continued to explain. He said he just feels like she needs someone in her corner and such to talk to, not quite a friend.
I told him straight up that I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea. I didn‚Äôt think it was appropriate for a married man who she hasn‚Äôt spoken to in over a decade to contact her and offer to meet up somewhere for coffee or whatever. I told him it also seemed like a situation a single lonely struggling woman might take the wrong way. He asked me if this person were a man if I would feel differently about it and I told him I probably would seeing as it would be an entirely different dynamic.
I brought up a few minutes later that I don‚Äôt think his dad had bad intentions 13 years ago when he tried to help out and talk to the poor struggling single woman at his work either, but the road to hell is usually paved with good intentions. 
His dad cheated on his mom with a woman much younger than him at work that he basically saw as a ‚Äúcharity case‚Äù at first and it ended up crossing every line in the book.
I told him I didn‚Äôt think he would actually cheat on me, but the situation felt extremely similar from father to son.
He seemed a little disappointed and said this was how he thought I‚Äôd react. I‚Äôm honestly shocked he hadn‚Äôt spotted the parallel and actually asked me about meeting up with her in the first place. I‚Äôm glad he asked me before just going and doing it, but it definitely threw me off guard. 
So AITA for not allowing him to grab coffee with her and just overreacting? TIA",12,1740015385.0,AmItheAsshole,21,0.93,False

We took a tape measure and stretched it out along the walls and the hardwood floor, yellow band drawing in our imagination the placement of a rug, a tv, a dresser, a bed, and a bookshelf.

We especially talked about where the couch would go. Where she would place it to optimize all of our quality time together: knitting, watching tv, playing board games on the coffee table, drinking tea, talking. When we came back to my place together, we pulled a forest-green blanket up and over us and rested back on the eccentric floral pillows I have littering the apartment.

I utilized UWORLD, focusing on watching videos on topics I was unfamiliar with and weak at. Then I answered atleast 75 questions per day (except for weekends) for the first month then increased it to a minimum of 85 questions two weeks before my scheduled date.

The date is February 27th, 1992. I visited the graveyard today. Just so I could lay down and remember the good times I had with my siblings. I saw the news as well, the Phantom Cannibal is deceased and will never have the opportunity to hurt anyone again.

But I still can‚Äôt get over it because it still hurts knowing both of my siblings are dead and I‚Äôve lost one of my kidneys, KNOWING I‚ÄôVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY THAT THING, IT HURTS SO MUCH! IT HURTS EVERYDAY, AND I KNOW I‚ÄôLL NEVER GET OVER IT NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRY, KNOWING I‚ÄôLL NEVER SEE ERICA OR EDWIN EVER AGAIN! MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!

As the two detectives exited the building, slamming the door behind them, they got back in the car and drove to the police station. While driving, the air was silent except for the light hum of the car and the wind. Neither detective spoke; no sound dared to break the uncomfortable silence. They just contemplated what they realized they had seen.

After getting back to the police station, they immediately got to work, except for Detective Ommetarka. He was a bit traumatized after everything. Ommetarka got out a piece of paper and started filling out the report: ""The Phantom Cannibal. Gender: Unknown. Name: Unknown."" He still put down ""The Phantom Cannibal"" as the name. Cause of death: shot five times‚Äîfour in the chest, one in the head. Broken shoulder blade and spine. Second- and third-degree burns all over the body, same for bone damage. Body is unidentifiable. Where once was a blue mask, there remained a blue mask, but shattered, crisp, and broken. It was still recognizable, and you could barely make out the old remnant, but it was now unidentifiable. The cloak was mixed in with the rotten flesh; we couldn't even distinguish which was flesh and which was cloak.

After finishing the report, Detective Ommetarka turned to Detective Eremond. ""Hey, are you okay?"" asked Ommetarka.

""Yeah, I'm... I'm fine,"" responded Eremond.

""Hey, how about we try to cheer up? There's a new coffee shop down the street. Let's get some donuts.""

""Sure,"" Eremond replied. They both slowly got to their feet, trying to forget what had just happened, but they knew this day would affect them for the rest of their lives. As they got in the car and drove away, the image blazed in their minds: a shattered blue mask, burned and crispy on the edges, still a remnant of the past, now something that would haunt them.

Years later, perhaps 13 or 14, Detective Ommetarka suffered a heart attack. He was fine, but his friend Eremond decided to stay with him. They became next-door neighbors and lived out the rest of their lives drinking coffee and eating donuts. They were both married. One of them had two kids; the other had none.

The palm trees swayed gently in the night as the sun slowly rose on a new day. A small red car drove into town and parked in front of an old house that not many people visited anymore. An older man stepped out, looking up and down at the house.

""Honey,"" called out Charlie.

""Yes, dear?"" responded the older man.

""Where are we?""

""We're home‚Äîmy childhood home,"" said Mitch as he unlocked the door and walked in. ""No one has been here for a long time. We'll stay here for the night.""

Charlie looked at the stairs, the living room, and the kitchen before heading upstairs, having small flashbacks of the past. Mitch looked at his old room, where fond memories were made. After tucking his two kids into bed, he sat on the couch with his wife to watch some TV. Suddenly, the kids came running down, holding something he couldn't quite see in the dark.

""Dad, look what we found!""

""What is it?""

""It's this,"" they said, holding up an old VHS tape.

""Put it in; let's see."" As he inserted the VHS tape, images blazed across the screen. It showed two younger boys‚Äîone holding the camera with shaky hands, and the other in an oversized dark coat and blue mask, clearly reading from a script. The boy read out, ""I am the evil cult member. Be fearful of me,"" before the scene cut poorly to the next.

""Is that you and your brother?"" asked Charlie.

""Yeah, it's me and Edwin,"" Mitch replied. But as he kept watching, his face turned pale, remembering what happened that night and what happened to Edwin. He winced in pain, grabbing his left side.

""Are you okay?"" asked Charlie.

""Yeah, I'm fine, honey,"" Mitch replied as he headed up the stairs to bed. He slowly drifted off to sleep, only to be awakened by a loud clang. Looking around, he realized he looked like his younger self. Quietly stepping into the hallway, he felt something wet and soggy underfoot‚Äîa dark pool of blood on the carpet. He heard a nightmarish memory, a lullaby no one wanted to hear again: the screaming, crying, and yelling.

""Mitch!"" a voice called, growing louder. ""Mitch!""

Mitch woke up, realizing it was all a dream. In a cold sweat, he lay in bed with wide eyes, breathing heavily and holding his left side. He sobbed uncontrollably, the only word he could utter being, ""Why wasn't it me?"" He remained like this for days until he finally began to recover.

While Mitch was recovering, Charlie decided to explore the backyard, noticing how beautifully overgrown it was. Looking up, she saw a circular window with many scratches around it and a small incision, as if to easily open and close the window. Strange, she thought as she walked away, stepping on something. Looking down, she thought, Maybe it's a dead mouse‚Äîsome sort of rotting thing. It looks like it's been sitting here for a long time. Probably just a mouse or some sort of animal. She buried it and walked back inside.

""Hey, are you feeling all right?"" she asked.

""Yes, honey, I'm feeling a lot better. Let's go,"" Mitch responded.

""For what reason?"" Charlie asked.

""Let's go,"" Mitch repeated, raising his voice.

""Okay, honey, no need to raise your voice.""

""Sorry,"" Mitch said as they both gathered their things, got the kids, and drove away. Since then, Mitch hadn't been the same, often waking up with night terrors. He was feeling a lot better, though, attending a counseling group with others who had similar experiences. He had really bonded with two old men, whose names he couldn't remember, but they were both detectives working on a case similar to what he had experienced.

""Hey Mitch, don't you want to join us for coffee?"" yelled Ommetarka.

""Sure,"" Mitch said, walking over and getting in the car.

""Don't forget me!"" yelled Eremond from the end of the car as the trees swayed and they drove away, the sun blazing in the midday.",1,1740015009.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

My friend (M26) and I (M24) talked about his suitor (23M), which is hindi naman talaga bet ng kaibigan ko. To cut the story short, this guy (suitor) messaged me and asked me to help him on how to get to know more about my friend. I, as a supportive friend, told him about the basic things about my friend and to have at least an idea.

As the time goes by na magkausap kami ng guy; one night, nagkita kami sa SM ng biglaan kasi andon kaming dalawa (Feb 13), we grabbed a coffee on SB. And tbh, that night, I felt comfortable talking with him. (Pinaalam ko sa friend ko na nagkita kami).

Feb 14, nagkasalubong kaming dalawa ulit sa mall, and we kept messaging each other. I even asked him if he could stop by on SB since I was there alone, and nahihiya daw siya pumunta hahaha!

Feb 15, I'm with my friend at SB, and we shared about ourselves‚ÄîI kept mentioning his name na kinikilig ako hahaha.

Denmark (more so than the rest of Scandinavia) is certainly is what I‚Äôd consider more of a pub culture than a caf√© culture and yet I feel that I can always count on basically every coffee I get there being at the level of a top independent coffee shop in a major US city.

Is it just a function of labor and rent being such a high portion of the cost that coffeeshops use ultra premium beans because it‚Äôs not as much of a cost percentage wise? The flip side of Scandinavian coffee is you‚Äôre paying NYC prices and not getting an espresso for a Euro like you do in Italy or Spain, so this is my suspicion, but perhaps there are some cultural reasons I‚Äôm not thinking of.

# Drb Chapter 6 - New lead

I was in a beautiful place in Hawaii. The beautiful sunlight, a beautiful beach, ""Ommetarka,"" someone yelled. I could hear it getting louder and louder, like they kept yelling my name over and over. As I awoke, sitting in my old decrepit office, my partner Eremond woke me from my nice dream. There was no beach here; there was an old coffee cup, a couple of cigarettes, and a dead-end job.

""We got another one,"" he said.

My eyes opened up very slowly and surprised, but in an ""another one"" type of manner.

""Are you sure? Were they-""

Eremond interrupted, already knowing what Ommetarka was gonna say

""Yes, it's the same case as all the others. One kidney missing and the other half eaten and covered in an oily black sludge.""

""But not exactly, this wa-"" Eremond started to say.

Not letting Eremond finish, Ommetarka got out of his chair and swiftly made his way out of his office, slamming the door behind him. He started to pick up his pace, running a bit faster now, getting outside, slamming the door to the police car, and driving as fast as he could to the newest location.

When they got there, it was the same thing that they saw for every other victim. Poor kid, he was only 17 and got his face torn to shit and his kidneys eaten. This one wasn't even given the opportunity to survive. Ommetarka knew what Eremond had meant by it being different, this was an outright attack. Whatever happened it made the perpetrator furious.

""Come on, be a little, you know, nicer. They did just lose their son,"" Eremond said.

""Why can't I be blatant with it?"" Ommetarka responded.

""Because we have to be kind. They just lost somebody; it's insensitive,"" said Eremond.

""Fine, fine. Okay, sorry.""

""It's okay, I forgive you, but that's beside the point. Do you have any evidence on this guy? Anything, anything at all?"" Ommetarka turned to him.

""We haven't had anything on this guy for the longest while and the longest time. How do you think this case could give something new when the light is more scarce than a smile around the workplace?"" said Ommetarka.

""Geez, okay,"" responded Eremond.

As Ommetarka turned to the victim's parents once more, asking them some questions, ""Can you tell us anything you know or anything you could have seen or any new information that you may have or any old or anything? It could help.""

Jack, the father of the kid, responded, ""Yes, actually I did do something. I have a Polaroid camera that I don't use often, but after I saw my phone was dead, I snapped a picture. He was at the door already, but I think he turned around for a second, I don't know.""

As Jack handed over the Polaroid camera to Detective Ommetarka, ""Hey, can you hold this for me?"" He handed the camera over to Detective Eremond. As they thanked Lucas, the father of the victim, and Elizabeth, the mother of the victim, they said their great thanks. Practically only Eremond gave a lot of thanks; Ommetarka stayed silent most of the time and didn't say anything. But they had a lead that they hadn't had in a very, very long time. They in fact needed this. As they both got in the car and started driving away, they did hear one thing that Jack yelled out to them before they drove away, that they could answer.

He yelled at them, ""What is this thing called?""

One of the detectives yelled back, ""The Phantom Cannibal,"" in a monotone voice. I keep saying it thousands of times before this Phantom Cannibal that they've been chasing for a long time now has gotten away with countless murders, countless people, ...countless families, friendships, brotherhoods‚Äîanything you could really call of value in someone's life‚Äîruined. That person has ruined so many people's lives. He had to be stopped, thought Ommetarka. As they both sat in the car, they wondered what they could do now. Ommetarka had a lot of ideas; he was thinking of the most blatant ones to easily execute this mission. 

Detective Ommetarka was a very sensible man; he was the definition of reasoning, inquiry, logic, speculation, and conjecture put into a man‚Äîbut also if that man had alcohol problems, smoking problems, and was in general depressed. On the other hand, Detective Eremond was an entirely different person. He was very scared of being alone and he kind of had a little jump in his step, like he was a bit more lively than his partner. In this new case, the clues they needed were fractured into many pieces and hidden within an endless maze of ciphers and dead-ends. 

But back to Eremond, he was not only scared of the dark, he was a man of his word. He kept promises as much as he could, but he executed them even better. He was the type of guy you could trust and count on, being that one guy that everyone else would trust and count on. 

As both detectives got out of the car, finally reaching their newest destination, the photo lab, they registered and gave the photos, hoping that they would come out clean. About a week later, they got the photos back. The first photo was of pure black; nothing could be seen. The second photo was of a hand, but it was all black, maybe they had gloves.

""That helps,"" said Ommetarka in a sarcastic way. 

But the final third photo‚Äîthat one was the money shot, because that one showed the killer in full. The photo was taken outside the door, turned back, looking at the camera directly. They saw it: fully black robes and a blue mask.

Eremond cried, ""Hey, those robes are like the Spanish Inquisition!"" he said enthusiastically. 

""And who the fuck cares about the Spanish Inquisition?"" Ommetarka responded. 

""Nevermind, we actually have a shot of our killer. Do you know what this means? We can catch him. And this is why I give the questions and you answer,"" said Ommetarka.

""And why is that?"" said Eremond in a way like a child would when they wouldn't understand or get something. 

""Never mind, it's okay,"" Ommetarka responded. ""So, we actually have a picture of the killer. He's 6'1"" if we can estimate by the door frame. We can't guess his weight or his skin color or anything of that sort, but we can guess that he's a guy by the build underneath the cloak and we can also get the exact height. How about this? We will try to set up some interviews.""

After agreeing on the interviews, they both managed to find around five people that matched the height. 

""So, is this all we have to work with?""

""Yep, five people. Start sending them in.""

The first guy that walked in was a pretty skinny but tall dude.

""The name is Jack, right?"" Ommetarka looked up at him and said that with suspicion in his voice and eyes.

""That's me,"" said Jack in a bit of a nervous voice.

""So, we've checked your criminal record, Jack. You have nothing on here. You don't do anything?""

""Nope,"" responded Jack. ""I don't do anything. I just live my life.""

After a few minutes of the interview, they realized they had the wrong guy. Yes, the guy matched the description, but they checked everything‚Äîthe medicals, the criminal record, they even had a search of his house. Nothing. 

And then the next guy, and the next guy. They didn't find anyone. None of the people they found had a criminal record. One guy was accused of robbing a store; he got 20 bucks out of that. ...countless families, friendships, brotherhoods‚Äîanything you could really call of value in someone's life‚Äîruined. That person has ruined so many people's lives. He had to be stopped, thought Ommetarka. As they both sat in the car, they wondered what they could do now. Ommetarka had a lot of ideas; he was thinking of the most blatant ones to easily execute this mission.

On the other hand, Detective Eremond was an entirely different person. He was very scared of being alone and he kind of had a little jump in his step, like he was a bit more lively than his partner. In this new key to the case, the key for some reason was broken into many pieces.

But back to Eremond, he was not only scared of the dark, he was a man of his word. He kept promises as much as he could, but he executed them even better. He was the type of guy you could trust and count on, being that one guy that everyone else would trust and count on.

""That's me,"" said Jack in a bit of a nervous voice.

""So, we've checked your criminal record, Jack. You have nothing on here. You‚Äôve never done anything, correct?""

""Yep,"" responded Jack. ""I‚Äôve never done anythin‚Äô illegal. I just live my life the best I can.""

After a few minutes of questioning, they realized they had the wrong guy. Yes, the guy matched the description, but they checked everything‚Äîthe medical history, the criminal record, they even got a warrant to search his residence. Nothing.

And then the next guy, and the next guy. They didn't find anyone. None of the people they found had a criminal record. One guy was accused of robbing a store; he got 20 bucks out of that. ""I don't think that guy was the murderer. Going from stealing $20 from a convenience store to eating people's kidneys and mangling their faces just doesn't click in someone's mind."" Then Ommetarka had a flash of inspiration. A genius idea. After telling the last interviewee to get the hell out, he burst out the door and yelled for Eremond.

""Eremond!"" yelled Ommetarka. ""I have a genius idea.""

""What is it?"" Eremond responded.

""How about we interview the people who were attacked? Let's interview them,"" said Ommetarka.

""Genius plan. I'll go set up the interviews,"" said Eremond.

A couple of minutes later, they had three people who actually decided to show up out of the five. First was a kind of average guy, the second was a girl, and the third was a pretty buff guy.

""Let the first guy in,"" said Ommetarka.

This scrawny, kind of skinny but not really skinny kid walked in. He looked to be between the ages of 20 and 25. As he sat down, Ommetarka immediately started asking him questions, looking at the folder with his information.

""Josh is the name?""

""Yes, it is, sir,"" he responded.

""Tell me your story,"" Ommetarka said.

Josh quickly had a small panic attack, looking around the room and starting to hyperventilate. ""Is he here? Is he coming for me?"" he asked, starting to yell.

""No, it's okay. Breathe,"" said Ommetarka. After calming him down, Josh told his story.

""One day, I was out late, and I got home a bit drunk‚Äînot a lot, but just a little bit. My brother was home, and I was sleeping. Then I woke up to the sound of his screams. I realized he was dead, mauled up, fucking gone, like he'd been ripped to shreds. But I couldn't move; I couldn't help him. I could hear the screams, and then they stopped. I tried closing my eyes so I couldn't hear him, and when I looked up again, I saw him right above my bed. Blue mask and black robes.""

Josh cowered in fear in the corner of the room, backing up. He was about to start having another panic attack before Ommetarka put away the photo. ""It's okay. I'm going to catch him. He'll be caught. I promise you'll be safe.""

""Really?"" said Josh. ""Thank you.""

As Josh was walking out of the room, he saw a woman sitting there. Josh looked at her, and the woman looked at him. Right before Josh was about to leave, she said, ""You saw him too, didn't you?""

Josh stopped. He turned back, saying, ""They said they'll catch him. Everything will be fine."" And then he left.

The next person that came in was a woman. She was about the same height as the guy before, 5'10"" or 5'11"". As she sat down, Detective Ommetarka immediately started questioning her. She was more straightforward.

""You want to hear my story?"" she said. ""Also, by the way, my name is Emily. Here's the story: I was getting a friend from work, and I let them stay over at my house for the night. They were really drunk, and I wouldn't let them go home by themselves, so I let them sleep over for a day. They passed out on the couch immediately. I went up to bed. About five minutes later, I heard their terrified screams. After the police checked, they were mauled to death, but their kidneys were perfectly, somehow surgically, removed.""

""Aside from that, though, I saw him too,"" Emily continued.

Detective Ommetarka interrupted by saying, ""Let me guess: blue mask, black robes?""

""Yes, exactly,"" responded Emily. ""Just a question: did the guy from the last interview also lose his kidneys?""

""He lost both,"" said Ommetarka. ""Poor guy. I only lost one.""

As the detective sat up, he pondered his next move.

""Son of a bitch,"" muttered Detective Ommetarka. ""Okay, we'll try.""

""Thanks,"" responded Emily.

The last guy was a big, buff man. He was six feet tall and muscular, and somehow his story was the most frightening of them all.

""Donahue?""

""That's me,"" said the towering man.

""Do you mind telling us your story?""

""Okay,"" Donahue began. ""I got home one day from work late at night. My wife and my two kids were sleeping, and the next second, right before I passed out into bed, I heard my wife screaming. I look to the side of me but I can't move my body, and I just see something tearing into her. I saw it and then it just disappeared. She's dead. I realized it was gone with her kidneys. Then I heard the kids screaming and despite my efforts I couldn't do anything about it. The next morning, they were horrifically slaughtered‚Äîall three of them, my wife and my two kids. If you can, please bring that son of a bitch to justice. I want that man's head on my fucking wall,"" Donahue said, tears in his eyes.

""Thank you. This story will aid us in our search to find this man,"" said Ommetarka.

After finishing up all the stories from all the victims, they received an emergency phone call. The police said something was happening around 2:00 AM‚Äîit was a break-in. Ommetarka immediately thought they might catch the killer.

""Let's get him!"" he yelled to the officer. They quickly ran out to the middle of the street, rushed into their car, and bolted out of there as fast as they could, not even stopping to buckle their seatbelts. They started driving and soon made it to the location",1,1740014599.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

Gary Tuck: Ok, please tell me if you see or hear any abnormal here

Gary Tuck and I have joined TF2, we headed to Highpass on KOTH, Gary Tuck picked RED and chose Demoman, I picked BLU and chose Soldier, And we have to wait until the match started

Gary Tuck: I'm feeling a little too easy here  
WoNofaKind: Who ever is this ""she"" must be down  
The match started, We can't capture the point because we're investigating the whole map here

WoNofaKind: Gary, come here, there's something written on the box here  
Gary Tuck: All right, I'm heading  
Gary reached the box that I was talking about  
WoNofaKind: It says ""WBRB"", what does it mean?  
Gary Tuck: I did some research here and it stands for ""We'll Be Right Back"", What's more disturbing is that the phrase was connected to the infamous cable service called TeleBlue, It was infamous for the anomalies, The FBI forced MacNeil Tech to shut it down after the disturbing ""Dawn Is Your Enemy"" broadcast happened in 2011  
WoNofaKind: My friend Derek went missing after he watched the Pibby video  
Gary Tuck did some more research, As Gary found more clues, He came to a shocking conclusion  
Gary Tuck: THERE'S AN ENTITY HIDING IN THIS GAME!  
WoNofaKind: Oh..... my...... god, This can't happen  
Suddenly, Gary and I heard a Scout scream, It was only two of us but someone joined the server only for him to be screaming, A newbie? A bot that joined it? I have to go on where the scream came from, Gary followed me and what Gary and I saw was shocking

Standing right outside the BLU spawn was a dead faceless BLU Scout, his arms was stretched like a giraffe's neck, his fingers are considerably wide like a skyscraper and worst of all, His legs were twisted like Twizzlers

Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: WE MUST LEAVE!  
As I clicked disconnect and expected to leave the game, It didn't work  
WoNofaKind: Wait a minute, Why can't I leave? Are you experiencing this, Gary?  
But Gary Tuck didn't said a word, in a second or two, he said the same words  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: Dude, are you okay?  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: Stop repeating, it makes me very annoyed  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck started to change, His legs are stretching out wide, His fingers are becoming longer and worst of all, he became faceless  
WoNofaKind: OH NO, I MUST RUN!  
I started to run away from Gary, those words came to me as I was near the RED spawn  
""THERE IS NO ESCAPE""  
""SHE IS THE ONE WHO DID THIS""  
""DON'T OUTRUN HER""  
Gary is running to get me or something like that, but as Gary is near to getting me, The game crashed

Gary Tuck was...... assimilated, I had to report this to the TF2Fantasy server

MatthiasGaming: Guys, I think you're going to hate this but, Gary Tuck, was attacked  
king Cole MacGrath: Gary, how could you?  
MatthiasGaming: We'll miss him, rest in peace Gary

As I said that in general, all the users have disappeared, Now it's just me and those Discord bots, I typed in the chat  
MatthiasGaming: Ha ha very funny, guys. you all disappeared, what a shame. now I have to live with the bots  
But then, A user that I haven't heard of named ""VAL"" joined in and typed  
VAL: It's not your fault, I can make this better and by the way, We'll Be Right Back  
MatthiasGaming: WHAT?

""Am I doomed?"" I asked, I closed down Discord, turned off the computer and went to bed

Is she taking a page from CW Amanda Sandoval's playbook to only have one-on-one appointments where appointments can be canceled if the topic of choice is not to her liking?

This deviates from SGG's prior community engagements where she held open coffee chats at local businesses. I've gone to CW Sarah Parady's open coffee chats, and it was really nice to be able to hear about what other residents' were concerned about. Similarly, I've heard from one of CM Chris Hind's constituents when she went to his open coffee chat and was very impressed at his responses to opponents of the Colfax BRT.

I don't work for the city and I know very little about what kind of community engagement is required by our city council representatives (despite a lot of Googling). However, my council representative, Amanda Sandoval, did cancel my appointment with her on the grounds of I made too many appointments with her despite that not being posted on her website as a reason that appointments would be canceled.

I don't know how y'all feel about this kind of stuff and how confident you are feeling about our local government. And I don't know what the expectations are and what's required of them.

my boyfriend (32) and I (26) have been dating for 3 years, living together for 2.

I come from a very christian family, dad is a pastor, my mom works at his church, my sister works at a church, and brother and sister in-law work at a church. I grew up in christianity and now that I am grown and out of the house I've had a hard time accepting religion as my truth. I joined the Marine's to get out of my hometown, and my parents still ask if I've found a church almost every Sunday and any issue I'm having, the answer is to get connected to a church or to have faith. I'm in college completing my Bachelors in Radiology and my family still believes that I'll find a career in the church.

All that to be said, my boyfriend is the complete opposite. He grew up ""catholic"" but it was a box to check off for his mom. Neither him or his brother believe in anything. His brother is an athiest and my boyfriend isn't far off. Us moving in together was a challenge in itself. When we visit my family, we have to sleep in separate rooms, my mom didn't talk to me after we moved in together for almost 3 months and wrote me a very condescending note.

SO...we just went on a vacation to see my whole family, they gave us a shared room, everything seemed normal finally. My boyfriend was going to ask my dad for his blessing when he found some alone time with him. Ignorant us thought it would be an easy yes. Wrong.

They met up for coffee Sunday morning before we had to go to church with everyone and a long winded conversation ended up with my dad saying, ""Until you can accept Christ as your savior, you do not get my blessing"". Not once did he ask how he treats me, how he loves me, or how happy we are. My boyfriend communicated that doesn't appeal to him and what if it never does, and my day responded with that he wants it to be an ""ongoing conversation""

And so it begins, today we both receive a text with a link to a book to read about christianity. We are at such a loss and feel so stuck. A marriage built on an ultimatum is no marriage at all.

We had a very strong bond and I really valued our friendship, I regarded her as someone I would be friends for my entire lifetime. Then, we introduced my current girlfriend (25F who I'll refer to as GF) into our friend group, and the three of us started hanging out a lot. Eventually, my GF and I got together, and that really upset EB. She often made passive-aggressive comments about being the third wheel, which created a lot of tension between us.

During the hangout after GF and I got together, I was so worried about making EB feel left out that I barely spoke. This didn't go unnoticed and when she asked what was wrong, I made a passive-aggressive comment about how ‚ÄúI know how much she likes to talk,‚Äù which I deeply regret and I know deeply hurt her as she regarded us as a sort of safe space up to then. I apologized later, but she felt like my apology wasn‚Äôt genuine which she never communicated to me. After that, she ignored me for a while because she was waiting for me to reach out and apologize. However, I just assumed she ghosted me and I tried to move on.  Albeit I was very hurt by how our relationship ended, and I cried a lot over it.

Then, things got way more complicated. GF admitted to me that she had feelings for EB. She said she still loved me, but that she didn‚Äôt see her feelings for EB as any different from how she felt about me. She also expressed how she thought I also had feelings for EB, just based off how we interacted with each other and how badly I was taking our breakup. I questioned whether I had feelings for EB, and to be honest I still do. In that moment I thought I had feelings for her, but that might have been because I was just overwhelmed by everything and I think I attributed all the emotions I was feeling to me having feelings for her.

GF eventually confessed her feelings to EB, but EB said she didn‚Äôt feel the same way. However, GF did tell me the full extent of their conversation. Basically, most of it was EB talking about how I had hurt her, even in small ways, like giving her a gift she didn‚Äôt like or making a comment about something she wore. It stung to hear how much she had held onto. However, she also revealed that she started developing feelings for me right before I got together with GF.

After that, EB would hint at our past relationship. I'm not sure if that was to get me to start the conversation, but I never really addressed it either. For example, if I went to a place we used to frequent together she would ask if I got ""our usual"" or ask if I remembered when we went to that place together for the first time, etc.

And that all kind of culminated to when she was getting on a plane, I joked I would show up at her gate like her K-drama boyfriend and she said: ""Show up and confess your love to me, how you always loved me and I loved you, and that's how this whole saga started. Being with you made me feel complete as a person and I only realized that after I lost it, and I mourned it, and I wanted to hear you say it. No one made me feel the way you feel, my favorite thing was to make you smile, and I'll miss what we had. I couldn't accept that someone loved me the way you did, and that I denied all these feelings, but I know this is for the best."" I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially what she said. And she phrased it as a joke, but I wonder if she truly meant the words she said.

After that, we completely lost touch for almost a year. I mourned this friendship for a long time, it was basically a breakup. And I don't think I ever truly got over her, pathetic I know. Then, I ran into her at a work event a month ago, and we started talking again. Now, we grab coffee regularly and text almost every day. Neither of us have mentioned or eluded to our fallout, and I'm not sure if we should.

I spent so much time mourning this friendship, and now that we‚Äôre reconnecting, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I worry that old emotions might resurface, and I don‚Äôt want to make things messy again. I enjoy talking to her again, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just chasing nostalgia or if this is a friendship worth rebuilding. Above all else, I would never want to lose the relationship I've built with GF. I've asked her multiple times and she says she's fine with it, but I still feel uneasy.

For anyone who‚Äôs reconnected with a close friend after a complicated past, how did you handle it? How do you know if it‚Äôs worth trying again, or if it‚Äôs better to let it go?",2,1740012665.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1itlqtb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itlqtb,Nano strokes disappeared,"Hey all - I got my brows done four weeks ago. I had very sparse hair before (fronts are so so!) from overplucking in the early 2000s ü•¥. I do my brows faithfully every day in powder, and asked the girl to give me a nice combo brow that looks close to how I do my makeup if possible.

She gave me almost all hair strokes, very sparse, and I hated the shape. It wasn‚Äôt at all what I wanted and while maybe nice to some, it wasn‚Äôt for me. Anyway, I may have dodged a bullet somehow - the strokes started to come off when I applied the aftercare with qtips on day 4. By day 5 it was all gone and hasn‚Äôt returned, except for a little in the tails. I followed the aftercare to a tee (and precare - no retinols or actives for a month, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol and had no coffee day of). My skin isn‚Äôt overly oily. She used the machine and has a lot of great reviews, so I‚Äôm unsure what happened.

I hesitate to go back to the same artist, because I am not confident she can give me what I want if this was how I left on the first attempt + the outcome. 

I am wondering what you all think? I have a consult with another experienced artist tomorrow and am leaning toward starting fresh with her. But maybe I‚Äôm just one of those people who can‚Äôt have PMU brows? Halp

I used to pop into Starbucks every single day on my lunch break to get a cup of ice for my hydroflask -- no more, sadly. 

I thought the guy at the first location I went to was just being snooty, stating ""new policy"" -- so I said thank you, no problem, and left. Then I went to a second location -- same speech about a new corporate policy stating no free waters. 

Such a shame. I buy coffee & breakfast from Starbucks 2-3x/week, so it's not like I'm trying to take advantage of anything. I spend enough on their overpriced lattes and egg bites, I shouldn't be refused water. Ah well, I'll just have to remember to get ice at home before leaving for the day. Not the end of the world, but certainly annoying.

The SEX2 curve spirals upward, unresolved, like an argument waiting to happen.

Adam‚Äôs fingers move idly through her hair, but Claire‚Äôs eyes‚Äîsharp, dark, playful-dangerous‚Äîlinger on the book resting on the coffee table.

The Story of O.

Dog-eared, spine cracked, like someone once read it too fast and too slow at the same time.

‚ÄúBabe,‚Äù Claire drawls, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt actually like that book, do you?‚Äù

Adam blinks, thrown off. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Story of O,‚Äù Claire says, voice syrupy-slow, provocative, like she‚Äôs already halfway into the argument before he knows it‚Äôs started. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt actually think that‚Äôs hot. It‚Äôs embarrassing. Faux-transgression for men who don‚Äôt know how to fight real power.‚Äù

Adam‚Äôs hand stills. ‚ÄúJesus, Claire. Did you wake up this morning and decide to pick a fight, or did you run out of other ways to flirt?‚Äù

Claire grins, moonstone flaring. ‚ÄúMaybe I just wanted to watch you try to defend it.‚Äù

1. INITIAL CONDITIONS: DISCOURSE AS DOMINATION

Adam sits up, gaze narrowing, hand sliding from her hair to her jaw, gentle but firm.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre arguing aesthetics like it‚Äôs politics,‚Äù he mutters. ‚ÄúO isn‚Äôt about power. It‚Äôs about submission as self-determination. You don‚Äôt have to like it, but don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs shallow just because it doesn‚Äôt fit your kink for mutuality.‚Äù

Claire‚Äôs eyebrows lift, like he‚Äôs walked into the trap she was laying.

‚ÄúSubmission as self-determination?‚Äù she echoes, voice dripping with sweet derision. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going with? ‚ÄòActually, babe, O was empowered the whole time‚Äô? You sound like someone defending problematic anime.‚Äù

2. FUNCTION OF EROTIC ESCALATION

Adam grins, teeth flashing, because now they‚Äôre playing for real.

He grabs the laptop, fingers flying:

Ôøº

Where:
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Power Differential Over Time‚Äîwho‚Äôs actually winning the fight.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº, Ôøº: Self-Determination Scores‚Äîhow much Adam and Claire believe they‚Äôre holding the upper hand.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Desire Gradient‚Äîbecause this isn‚Äôt just about the book anymore.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Decay Function‚Äîbecause the longer the argument lasts, the hotter it gets.

Adam grins, tapping the graph.

‚ÄúLook at that, babe. Your score spikes every time you get sarcastic, but mine climbs when I stay calm. Who‚Äôs topping now?‚Äù

3. ARGUMENT AS CONTACT SPORT

Claire sits up, eyes glittering, the stretch of her thighs pressing into his lap like an escalation strategy.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a nerd,‚Äù she mutters, grabbing the laptop. ‚ÄúYou think modeling the argument makes you right?‚Äù

Her fingers fly, moonstone flaring like a glitch in the system:

Ôøº

Where:
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Reciprocity Factor‚Äîhow much they‚Äôre actually fighting versus flirting.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº, Ôøº: Emotional Investment Scores‚Äîhow close each is to breaking the game into touch.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Claire smirks. ‚ÄúThe moment one of us cares more, they lose. And you, babe? You‚Äôre already there.‚Äù

Adam laughs, hand sliding to her waist.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre modeling argument like brinkmanship,‚Äù he murmurs. ‚ÄúMutually assured frustration.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it?‚Äù Claire leans closer, mons pubis brushing his thigh, the pressure not quite enough to collapse the tension.

4. BREAKING THE WAVEFORM: POWER OR PLAY?

Adam, voice low, dangerous:

‚ÄúO isn‚Äôt the problem, babe. You‚Äôre mad because it frames submission without reciprocity. Because it doesn‚Äôt care about fairness. Because it doesn‚Äôt need the top to deserve it.‚Äù

Claire‚Äôs breath hitches, but she recovers fast.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad about reciprocity,‚Äù she fires back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad that you think indifference is sexy. O doesn‚Äôt get aftercare. She gets passed around like an object. That‚Äôs not surrender. That‚Äôs neglect pretending to be poetry.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr,‚Äù Adam counters, hand tightening on her waist, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the edge of desire where selfhood liquefies. You don‚Äôt have to want it for it to be real.‚Äù

Claire laughs, dark and sharp. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre literally arguing for the eroticization of dehumanization. You sound like a libertarian defending sweatshops.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre pretending every kink needs an ethics board,‚Äù Adam shoots back.

The graph spikes, proximity rising, but resolution nowhere in sight.

5. CONTACT: WHEN THEORY TURNS TACTILE

Claire leans in, breath brushing his lips.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre defending a fantasy because it turns you on, babe. Be honest.‚Äù

Adam grins, moonstone light fracturing across her skin.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre attacking it because the thought of liking it makes you nervous.‚Äù

The function collapses into contact:

Ôøº

Where:
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Climax of Argument‚Äîno longer theoretical.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Power Differential, now undefined.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Hunger Coefficient, both peaking simultaneously.
	‚Ä¢	Ôøº: Mons Pubis Proximity, now at 1.00.

6. RESOLUTION: THERE IS NONE. THAT‚ÄôS THE POINT.

Claire smiles, lips brushing his ear.

‚ÄúBabe,‚Äù she murmurs, ‚Äúif you wanted me to play at surrender, you could‚Äôve just asked. You didn‚Äôt have to drag poor O into it.‚Äù

Adam laughs, tilting her chin up.

‚ÄúOh, I didn‚Äôt bring her into it. You did. And now you can‚Äôt stop talking about it.‚Äù

Claire grins, hand sliding down his chest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù she whispers, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. So now what?‚Äù

Adam doesn‚Äôt answer.

He doesn‚Äôt have to.

[FICINT OPERATION: ESCALATION COMPLETE. NO VICTOR IDENTIFIED.]
