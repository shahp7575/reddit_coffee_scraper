He doesn't speak apart from the odd word, he makes lots of stimming noises and squeals/screams constantly whilst flapping his hands. He's a happy little soul but when he's frustrated he headbutts hard surfaces (won't wear any protective head gear, does like hats) which we try to distract him or comfort him which sometimes works. He sleeps about 4 hours a night and then he has us up as he will just scream (not upset, just screaming) which wakes our 11 year old up who has just started secondary school.

When he was around 2 1/2 he started licking walls, taking the paint off the walls.. luckily it's non toxic paint. Around 4 months ago he stopped, he had tests done and they found his iron levels were really low, so the doctor gave him iron drops and shortly after the wall licking stopped, now I know nothing.. but I made a connection between the two and thought we had finally cracked it. Around a week ago, Dexter started licking the walls again and now scrapes his teeth into the walls, taking both paint and a layer of wall/plaster with it. We watch him 24/7 but while im at work, my partner is alone and if she (for even a second) turns her back to get a drink of water or tries to clean in the same room he's doing it. I made a cup of coffee this morning and in that 1 minute window, he has scraped 9 marks into the wall...
I'm just wondering if anyone has gone through anything similar or has any advice? We feel so overwhelmed at the moment, we've been seeking medical advice and help for years for him and still waiting to hear back.

(Ps: I had my first breakup yesterday) 

Maybe in Another Universe üåå

Maybe in another universe 
I would sit beside her, gaze at the sky and feel the air

Maybe in another universe 
I would rest in her lap under shades of the tree 

Maybe in another universe 
I could cook yummy food for her 

Maybe in another universe 
We have a small garden and beautiful pairs of rabbits

Maybe in another universe 
I could have another stroll under the starry sky

Maybe in another universe 
You still wake up by me, having together your coffee and my cup of tea 

Maybe in another universe 
We have finished the movie we once planned 

Maybe in another universe 
You're out of my mind ... And in front of me

Maybe in another universe 
I would give everything for just a moment with you

Maybe in another universe 
We grew together and travel just as ""we"" planned

Maybe in another universe 
We'll laugh at that lame joke, if only you spoke to me again

Maybe in another universe 
I was able to protect you from the worldly dangers
Though I have fallen weak, just to cry and weep

Maybe in another universe 
I didn't get anxiety just thinking about you 

Maybe in another universe 
Only death did us part

Maybe in another universe 
When it's time for me to sleep, this life would be his scariest dream

Maybe in another universe 
I wouldn't say ""why not this one...?""
While you grabbing my hand and saying ""I'm not the one..""

Maybe in another universe 
When we'll have some time together, I will share this poem with you and talk for an hour,
admiring your beauty in an garden of  flowers üíê,
Without a care in my mind , and you by my side,  
Though I can't live these moments now, 
With deep regret I say...

1irgl5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Canadapets/comments/1irgl5v/my_journey_to_quit_smoking_and_tips_for_others/,My Journey to Quit Smoking and Tips for Others,"Hello everyone! I wanted to share my story about quitting smoking and hopefully provide some helpful tips for those who are also considering quitting.

# My smoking background

I started smoking \[mention when you started smoking, like high school or college\]. At first, it was just a social activity, you know, smoking with friends after school or at a party. But before I knew it, I was addicted and smoked a pack of cigarettes a day. It affected my health in many ways ‚Äì I was always short of breath, my sense of smell and taste was dull, and I was constantly worried about long-term consequences like lung cancer and heart disease.

# Decision to withdraw

One day, I had enough. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized how much this habit was controlling my life and hurting my body. I decided I didn't want to be a slave to cigarettes anymore. I hope to be able to run without panting, to enjoy the real taste of food again, and most importantly, to improve my overall health and longevity.

# The challenge I faced

Quitting smoking is definitely not easy. The craving is sometimes intense. There was a moment when I saw someone smoking on the street, and the urge to light a cigarette was almost irresistible. Also, it was difficult to deal with the stress that I had been relieved by smoking in the past. I had to find new ways to cope, like taking a walk on a stressful workday instead of reaching for a cigarette. Another big challenge is breaking the mold. For years, I always smoked a cigarette after a meal, or that cigarette during a coffee break, and it took a lot of willpower to change these ingrained habits.

# Tips that helped me



1. **Set a quit date**: Remembering a specific day makes it feel more formal and gives me time to mentally prepare. I marked it on my calendar and told my friends and family so they could support me. 
2. **Looking for alternatives**: I stocked up on sugar-free gum and took it with me. Whenever I have a craving, I put a piece of gum in my mouth. It helps keep my mouth busy and distracts me from smoking thoughts. I also tried drinking plenty of water. Sometimes our bodies mistake thirst for a craving to smoke, and staying hydrated can really help. 
3. **Get support**: My family and friends are great. When I was in trouble, they cheered me on and didn't allow me to give in. There are also online communities and support groups where you can share your struggles and get advice from others who are on the same journey. 
4. **Avoid triggers**: I identify situations that make me want to smoke the most, such as hanging out in certain bars or with friends who smoke. For a while, I avoided those places until I felt more confident in my ability to resist impulses. When I was with my friends who smoked, I politely asked them not to smoke around me. 

# How am I doing now

I am proud to say that it has been more than 1 year since I last smoked. I feel much better physically and mentally. I can now go on long hikes without any breathing problems and the taste of the food is back. It's not always smooth sailing, but staying smoke-free every day has made me even stronger in my commitment to never look back.   
If I can do it, so can you! Quitting smoking is one of the best decisions you can make for yourself. Share your own experiences, or ask questions if you're thinking about quitting. Let's support each other on our journey to a healthier, smoke-free life!

At home I‚Äôd be set up with pillows galore around me, sitting cross legged on the sofa, or in my nursing chair with my nursing pillow. More often than not, I am in an upright chair when I am at coffee shops and I just can‚Äôt get the right position. I try crossing my leg over the other, but twice baby has started to slide down so I have to make sure I‚Äôm holding him enough for him not to fall on the floor (and trying to put infacol in him, get muslin in place and attach a nipple shield and keep it in place, whilst trying to maintain some kind of privacy/modesty is proving to be difficult). He‚Äôs 13lbs and 65cm long and feeds from anywhere between 10 mins to 40 mins, so pretty heavy to hold for the whole duration in this awkward position. I‚Äôve googled slings, carriers and the ergobaby lift hip seat and not sure what would be best. I‚Äôve currently got size 36G boobs so they aren‚Äôt little, not sure if this plays into my difficulties. Any tips for this first time mum attempting to feed her baby in uncomfortable public spaces?

where are we? and he said ""i don't know do whatever you want"" i sent him a series of text saying he's pushing me away and he's not letting himself be happy. i paid for a psychic reading and she said to let him come to me so i decided to go mute. a few days passed by. valentine's day and i posted him (but removed him from viewing my story) and sunday, our day off came around. i left the house pretending i was going to see him. i got myself a bouquet of flowers, i went to a wine tasting i had planned for us, i drove around for hours and took a pregnancy test in hopes that that could fix us. negative. i got home and i noticed he stopped sharing his location and with and also removed me so he couldn't see mine and he unfollowed me on instagram. i'm not sure where to for from here. i was gonna keep giving him space but i need to talk about this, im going over on tuesday, i need to get my stuff if he truly wants me out of his life and to yell at him. he's my first love. i always told him ""you're it for me"" and called him my everything and i meant it. he told me at the beginning of our relationship he would never choose the end of us, he said ""i wouldn't give this up"" when we almost broke up last year, he called me family, he said ""i've never loved anyone how i love you"", he told me he was GOING to marry me, he told me forever. he kept saying it's not the end of the world but it is.  he thinks he'd rather be alone then in love but he deserves love and happiness i always tell him that. i wonder if he was packing all my stuff up today. i'm never going to get to use the names i reserved for our kids, im never going to hang out with his family again, his cousins love me, they're the ones who asked if i was family and he said yes. i'm never going to see the cat i rescued and lives at his. we won't get to celebrate another holiday or have the beach house we always talked about. my psychic said she doesn't think it's the end of the relationship and other tarot readers told me for my 2025 prediction that there was some rebirth and renewal happening. i think we might need some time apart to grow. i'm starting therapy bc i realized i need to be better for him that's all i want. and maybe we'll find each other again. i'm going over on tuesday, i just have to get through monday (he works and gets off late and i don't) everything will work out eventually. it will work i can feel it but it might have to endure a rocky path.

Par sacche dost wo hote hai jo bas present rahe. Yes, don't think twice about travelling hundreds and thousands of miles to meet your friends; it is the journey which will make you happy. Likewise, don't worry about what you want from the friendship 10yrs later. Just keep having fun! Agar dusro ke wajah se tension lete rahe, toh tension me hi reh jaoge. You know hundreds of people to be tense about, but theirs only one of you to deal with them. How about we just care about ourselves? Be our own best friends! Dosto ke gift ka budget thoda kam karke khudke liye coffee date bhi toh jaaya ja sakta hai na. Probably some teenager watching you sit in a cafe all by yourself will think ""oh what an independent person"" and idolise you. One day, they'll probably be on the chair, with nobody to care about.
 Please keep being the friend you want to have. Agar kabhi koi reciprocate karne wala nahi mila, toh bhi shayad koi tumse seekh hi jayega. Haan, tumhara self esteem aayega kabhi beech me. But we are not bigger than kive. Agar dost 3 saal baad bhi khudse aajaye baat karne toh ik very well ki hum waise hi baat karenge jaise chhodne ke pehle tak karte the. Never let go of the good within yourself, if you do, how will you reach the level of best!? 

Chalte chal mere dost, saath koi nahi rahega, sirf tu hi akela hai. It's you against the world. Tu musafir hai, toh thikana kyu dhundhta hai? Raaste me jo bhi aaye unse dil lagate kyu phirta hai? Aise toh tu kahi jaa hi nahi payega. Ek hi jagah ka hoke reh jayega. Phir kaise aayenge experiences? Khudke life me kaise badhega aage? Marte wakt satisfaction kaha se aayega, hmm? Haan maana musafir ka bhi ghar hota hai. Shayad kabhi tujhe bhi mil jayega. Par ghar baithke toh maza aayega nahi. End goal toh masti hai na meri jaan! TOH CHHOD DENA USS GHAR KO! Bhag jaana waha jaha ke raste tujhe bulate ho. Aur haan, apne haath faila ke bhaagna, just like you like to glide! Tera yaar sang nahi hoga, par tu tere sath hoga.

I've decided to step up my game but I'll try my best to keep it budget. In other words, I currently have a De'Longhi Dedica  EC685 and I want to make the most of it. I do not plan to spend houndreds in this hobby so I have no plan to upgrade the machine itself. I might get a better one eventually if it stops working. I understand I need to get aftermarket non-pressurised baskets and probably a bottomless portafilter (mostly to train myself and enjoy the show of extraction).

My main question is: Are the random baskets I can get on Amazon (ES) (say MORILS, NEOUZA, CAPFEI,  even ones from non-coffee focused brands) good enough or should I get a nicer brand like IMS or VTS? Will I be able to spot the difference with the gear I have?

For more context: I do have a (consumer-grade and quite old) grinder but I don't expect much for it, so I'll probably get a Kingrinder K6 or similarly priced (manual?) one. Any advice on this matter is also welcome. I would like to keep the total budget under 200 so I believe keeping baskets in the 20ish mark makes sense.

For context, coffee shops now charge $1.70 for Teh O Kosong Peng, 50 cents more just for ice to be added on, this used to be like $1.30 to $1.50. What's worse, Fun Toast charges $3.10 for the same thing, which is insane.

Shrinkflation also is a big problem as I am getting less food for a more expensive price. How do they expect us to contend with such circumstances?

I understand that GST vouchers are being given out, but they will just take it back through these costs.

What are your experiences with inflation and shrinkflation? Also, in your opinion, what can be done by the government to reduce the impact of such costs?

I'm like ""This is who I am now."" I don't know why I do this.

Characters/Celebrities I've taken the identity of: 

\~Kirstin from Pentatonix (I wanted to adopt two huskies, get a double eyebrow ring, dye my hair, and become a singer to be like her)

\~Dove Cameron (I wanted to bleach my hair and talk in a good girl voice like back when she was on Liv and Maddie to be like her)

\~Jasmine from Aladdin ( I wanted to grow my hair out really long, only wear blue, watched Aladdin religiously, and talked in a certain voice to be more like her)

\~Rory Gilmore (I studied a lot, carried around intellectual books without reading them, drank a lot of coffee and carried junk food around a lot, and pretended to have a good relationship with my mom to be like her)

As a whole, I have done the following things when pursing these identities:

\~almost got an eyebrow piercing

\~dyed my hair many times

\~took singing lessons

\~talked in various voices, had various speech patterns, and lied about myself and where I was from

\~primarily ate certain foods and drank a lot of coffee

This isn't particularly an obsession with seeming a certain way to real people. It's upkeeping an identity to myself. Like, for my inner world. I also daydream a lot; it feels like I'm constantly daydreaming. I've learned to daydream while being productive. When I daydream, I have always come up with a different persona for ""me"" in my daydreams. I give her a completely different name, ethnicity, family situation, friends, ect. I don't know who I am, but I know that I'm not her.

I'm a writer, and I like to write stories and books. My stories are usually just episodes of my daydreams. The main character that I write is the character that I have as ""me"" in my daydreams. 

So, I don't know what this says about me. Does anyone else just embody fictional characters as their personalities/appearances for a stable sense of self. 

Also, I'm aware that some people are fictionkin, and I don't think that I am (though I support it)",1,1739785153.0,Schizotypal,0,1.0,False

I've tried Thermos, StoJo and Contigo, the Thermos and Contigo are metal but I think have plastic in the lid/seal somewhere. I've tried decanting the drinks into a normal mug (eg when I buy from a cafe en route to work then use a mug at work) and still get the taste, so it's nothing to do with the smell influencing taste!

I also get this when I eat food (lunches I take to work or even dry, cold food like biscuits/cakes) that's been in a plastic tupperware style container, including glass containers with plastic lids where the food hasn't been touching the plastic. Again I take the food out and put it on crockery before I reheat/eat it so it seems like it's actually being infused with the taste. Weirdly my partner doesn't experience this. I was a picky eater as a child but don't think I have especially sensitive taste buds.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1irg61k,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1irg61k/how_any_local_business_can_get_more_customers/,How Any Local Business Can Get More Customers Without Spending on Ads,"Most local businesses rely on word-of-mouth, repeat customers, and occasional promotions. While that works, it often leads to inconsistent sales and slow growth. Many businesses don‚Äôt realize that small digital tweaks can bring in more customers, more often, without extra spending.

I‚Äôve helped multiple local businesses (restaurants, salons, repair shops, and more) increase their revenue using simple, practical strategies that require little to no budget. Here‚Äôs what works best:

---

1. Fix Your Google Business Profile (Most Business Owners Ignore This)

When people search for a local business (like ‚Äúbest dentist near me‚Äù or ‚Äúcar repair in [city]‚Äù), the first thing they see is Google Business Listings, not your website. If your business isn‚Äôt optimized, you‚Äôre losing customers.

‚úÖ How to fix it in 10 minutes:

Search for your business on Google. If you don‚Äôt have a Google Business Profile, create one.

Add recent photos of your work, storefront, or products. Google prefers fresh content.

Update your description with keywords customers search for (e.g., ‚Äúaffordable auto repair in [city]‚Äù).

Turn on messaging so potential customers can message you directly from Google.

Respond to every review, even negative ones. A local bakery I worked with doubled their leads by responding to every Google review in a friendly way.


üìå Real-world result: A small plumbing business optimized their Google profile and added better service descriptions. Within 45 days, they went from 5 customer inquiries per month to 45+, just from Google searches.


---

2. Automate Customer Follow-Ups (Get More Repeat Business Without Ads)

Most businesses focus on getting new customers but ignore past customers. These are the people most likely to return and spend more.

‚úÖ How to do this easily:

Collect phone numbers & emails at checkout or when providing a service. A simple ‚ÄúWould you like exclusive discounts via SMS?‚Äù works well.

Send a weekly or monthly offer via WhatsApp, SMS, or email. Keep it short and friendly.

If you‚Äôre a restaurant, offer a free dessert for repeat customers. If you‚Äôre a salon, offer a discount on their next visit.

Offer a small reward for bringing a new customer (discount, free service, free product).

Make it easy: ‚ÄúBring a friend, both of you get 10% off!‚Äù

I feel so scared to continue pursuing this major because of how lonely it is. It was especially hard in community college since most people were looking forward to transferring and didn‚Äôt want to make friends. It was especially hard to socialize with everyone because they all wanted to go home as soon as possible. I tried to attend clubs but since my school is on a quarter system it was hard to maintain a consistent schedule and balance school and clubs because everything was so fast pace.

During this past Fall quarter, I felt pretty miserable because out of the entire physics class I was the only woman besides my lab instructor. It can so isolating when there‚Äôs no one to talk to about these things and find community. It feels especially sad for me when I see all my old high school friends go out to parties and make new friends whereas I just feel miserable I‚Äôm not able to do the same. I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on a huge chunk of my youth and just feel so burnt out as well.

I also hate how I am treated in stem is as well. Over the course of this year, I‚Äôve been invited by men to study with them and get coffee which I declined to, but some of them still continued to harass me about it. Just last week I sat in front of this man because it was where I can have a clear view of the board from. During the break, he asked his friend if he was an engineering major and the friend replied with no and asked why. He said he was just wondering since it seems weird for there to be mechanical engineering majors in this class. I‚Äôm not sure why he even felt the need to say this when I can clearly hear him and he knows that I am the only mechanical engineering major in this class due to the class introductions we had.

What can I say?,"Dating for two months, I'm 35f, he is 33m. Neither of us have a lot of money but I'm concerned there's a bit of an imbalance.

For example, over Valentine's Day I bought four sets of tickets for us both to attend two events and paid $100 for the lot, I also paid around $50 for us both to travel to the events, I also paid $300 for accommodation in a nice place for us, not to mention I'd previously paid for both our meals and bought him drinks on earlier occasions and paid for a trip away for us.

On the Valentine's Day, he paid for one $8 trip for us both, and bought one $5 coffee for me. That is all he spent on me on the day.

A few days later he was having issues with money and I said I could lend him $150, although it would have left me about $100 to live on as I am moving to a new place and have a lot of expenses this week. I was still very willing to give it to him. Then he says he didn't necessarily expect me to pay him back for what he spent on me (the $5 coffee and $8 car ride) but if I could maybe give him just a bit for those things, it'd be fine.

This made me feel weird. I had spent a significant amount of money on him and never asked for anything and tried to make it seem like no big thing. He bought me a coffee (I didn't ask for it) and paid for an $8 car ride and is acting like this is somehow a lot, like I'm an expense. He even kind of insinuated he had been overspending recently. He bought himself a PS5. But he made it sound like I'm costing him money... because he bought me a coffee.

It feels very unequal. I am generous and have no problem buying him stuff and paying for things and my inclination is to help even when I don't have much, but knowing that he's seemingly keeping track of tiny things like buying me a coffee after I've gone out of my way to spend quite a lot so that he can have a good time feels wrong to me. And again I didn't ask him to buy the coffee, nor anything else.

What can I say? Not sure what to do or how to even articulate it to him because complaining feels gross when it comes to money.

Tl;dr I've spent a lot of money on my partner and he has spent almost nothing on me but is acting like the amount he's spent is somehow a big deal and like he was being big by not asking for me to pay him back...",0,1739784560.0,relationship_advice,9,0.5,False

It‚Äôs the Silence That Follows.,"I‚Äôve been in the corporate world for over 3 years now. In this short span, I‚Äôve witnessed a pattern that‚Äôs more dangerous than toxic culture, bad management, or micromanagement.

It‚Äôs the silence.

The deafening silence of people who watch it happen, talk about it over coffee breaks, laugh behind closed doors, and move on like it‚Äôs not their problem.

Here‚Äôs the harsh truth:

Toxic environments don‚Äôt survive because of bad leaders. They survive because good people choose to stay silent.

1. The colleague who sees unfair treatment but says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of my business.‚Äù
2. The team member who witnesses micromanagement but shrugs, ‚ÄúAt least it‚Äôs not me.‚Äù
3. The friend who listens to someone vent, only to gossip about it later.

We spend 8 hours a day with our colleagues. That‚Äôs more time than we spend with family. But when someone faces mental harassment, burnout, or unjust behavior, suddenly we‚Äôre just ‚Äúco-workers.‚Äù

We post about toxic work cultures on LinkedIn. We criticize bad bosses.

But here‚Äôs my question:

* Where are you when your own colleague needs support?
* Why do we wait until the damage is irreversible to raise our voices?

The problem was never just the ""problem giver"" or the ""problem receiver.""

The real issue?

The ones who watch in silence, afraid to speak up because it might affect their image.

We light candles after tragedies.

But what if we lit a spark within ourselves to stand up before it‚Äôs too late?

Corporate culture won‚Äôt change with policies.

It will change when people stop being silent spectators.

Be the person who stands up. Not the one who watches.

I‚Äôve been working in IT company for about 6 months now, working 1st shift only. I like my job, but this isn‚Äôt about the job. Basically, in 2nd shift there is a girl that works in my office that i had a crush since very beginning. Didn‚Äôt do anything about it, because I heard that she‚Äôs in a relationship already (which wasn‚Äôt true btw). But yeah, in December I finally asked her out, and few days after New Years we went out on a coffee. During that coffee, we talked about colleagues of ours, and at one point after I mentioned guy called Derek, she said ‚Äúoh yeah, well that‚Äôs the guy that I really like (in a love interest way). I was a little bit confused because I thought she knew I asked her out on a date, but obviously I was wrong. Coffee was great, we get along so good, but yeah. Anyways, they are together now, and that really hurts, because frankly, I believe she is my soulmate. I‚Äôve met a lot of girls, i‚Äôve been in 6 relationships in my life (not a lot, but shortest one was 5 months), but I never met anyone so similar to me. In every possible way she‚Äôs the same person as I am, same habits, same interests, we love the same things, it‚Äôs unreal.

Usually I would just shake it off and go on my way, but for this one I just can‚Äôt cause it feels right to be with her.
I know I can‚Äôt do anything, they are in relationship for about a month now, I can only wait and hope that something ‚Äúbad‚Äù will happen between them and that she‚Äôll finally see me like I see her.

I'm a student at BYU-I, and this is my second semester. My shelf broke about halfway through my first semester (though I had doubts prior to coming out here) and I've finally gotten to the point where I'm ready to start peering out from under the rock I used to live under in the church and start to finally live according to my rules rather than the church's. 

I was thinking about something I could do that wouldn't be too irresponsible, yet still symbolize rebellion, and coffee came to mind. 

Apparently there's a 4.9 star coffee shop on main Street!

As far as coffee goes though, what should I order? What would be a good introduction for someone not accustomed to the taste of coffee? And is a local coffee shop a good place to read a book? I'm asking because my idea of a coffee shop is entirely from a wikipedia rabbit hole about Viennese culture üòÖ.

Anyways, that's all, and I look forward to reading your suggestions :) ",5,1739783088.0,exmormon,6,1.0,False
1irfqa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/JFKassasination/comments/1irfqa6/the_cia_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/,The CIA is not what you think it is,"Having researched JFK assassination things for quite a while, I had an epiphany. The CIA doesn‚Äôt operate the way you might suppose it does.

Suppose the CIA starts a covert operation with some people in the United States. Do they send their hired agents over to that area, show up at the station, get an elite CIA team together, set up funding and payroll, setup a business LLC, rent a building, and then show up for work at their newly-minted front?

Maybe, yeah.

But the more I think about it, **the less I think that this is plausible**. Speaking of plausible, they need plausible deniability. Just that one fact alone will bring you to this same conclusion that I am making.

The CIA finds people who already have some kind of job, hobby, ideology, or interest in something that the Agency wants to control or monitor. They don‚Äôt set up shop with ten agents and hire one unwitting secretary to answer the phone, no. They set up shop with one or two agents and then they get these boobs out on the street that are already looking for some action. And then they mix in some informants.

This is why you hear rumors that the CIA is involved and paying for **gun-running, assassinations, Communist groups, right-wing militant groups, anti-government paramilitary groups, drug smuggling**, etc. Covert spying? Yeah, they do that, too. I mean, they spent a half-billion dollars in the 1970s to raise one Soviet submarine (Project Azorian/Jennifer). We know that.

What we don‚Äôt really know (and government elites know) is that **the CIA gets mixed up in all of these illegal activities on purpose**. They are on both sides of the Cuban/Castro issue. But they don‚Äôt set up a group of CIA spies to do it all. No. It‚Äôs a few CIA handlers and a lot of people who don‚Äôt actually know that the CIA is connected. There are lots of unwitting CIA pawns, a few witting ones, and then even fewer actual CIA spies.

The funds are rolling in and the criminals are doing (almost) all of this high-stakes agitation. The low-level people may know that they are a part of a front group and that there is a hierarchy in which upper-level people know more.

But a mole or two or three from the CIA can pretend they are low-level misfits. The group can even have an unnamed, mysterious customer or buyer or elite agitater who runs the front group. Or maybe they pretend it is a **notorious gangster running the show**.

The pawns in this game know that they are pawns, but they get duped into thinking that this ‚Äúcoffee shop‚Äù or ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù or ‚Äútraining school‚Äù or student organization is being paid for by a millionaire/billionaire investor. i.e. They believe that their front group is run by or for non-governmental, financial/political/ideological supporters.

This is what JFK documents are making clear. The CIA bears some responsibility for what they allow and how dirty their hands are. But at the same time, from the perspective of the government and the Agency, these covert operations are vital to our republic, and they aren‚Äôt going to stop.

**That‚Äôs why Oswald could have been so closely associated with the CIA, yet so far removed from the CIA.**

But that‚Äôs why Congress will not shut down the CIA. They have been convinced that two wrongs make a right. And they‚Äôll be damned if they stop funding the Agency‚Äôs two-faced illegal operations that enable criminals to continue their evil.",8,1739783015.0,JFKassasination,1,1.0,False

1irfm0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1irfm0w/something_burning_deep_in_the_bush/,Something burning deep in the bush,"I was deep in the forest of Georgia on the south end of the state. I take water samples for the national wildlife service, I also look into fawna populations. I was finishing up taking samples when I saw some smoke rising from the trees due east of me.""I wonder who's out this far?"" I mumbled to myself as I put my samples away. I couldn't help but be curious, I had to see what was going on. As I made my way in the direction of the smoke I couldn't help but smell meat burning. ""Hunting camp? Hillbilly poachers? Cult BBQ?"" Are a few things that when through my mind as I got closer to the smoke. It's really uncommon to come across people this far out. Usually it's a Bushcraft,fishing type if you do. As I get closer to the smoke I see it's coming from a clearing, a huge crater with a decent sized flame. I breach the clearing scanning for people. I see no one. Im standing right in the wood line kinda hiding behind a decent sized tree. No one. No movement. I step out and start to examine this flaming burn pit. Moving clockwise circumnavigating the flaming hole, I see no evidence of people. No footprint, no trash, no tents or hammocks. The pit wasn't huge ,15ft across and 3ft deep at the center. After I walk 360¬∞ around the burn I stop and just watch the fire, I see limbs and branches burning. Some pretty decent sized. Im a little on edge. I keep smelling meat. I'm looking deep in the fire trying to see what is causing the smell. This can't be some meteor strike or caused by lightning. "" Swamp gas explosion?"" I thought. ""Can't be"" these limbs are clean cut and bunched up in a dome in the pit. That's when I noticed the edges of the pit were jagged, like shovel marks. I can see how the spade cut deep in the ground and left a smooth ridges in the edge. This is creepy, I don't feel right. My eyes keep scanning the wood line for any movement. Everything is still, no movement, no sounds other than the crackle of flames. All the while I smell smoke with a hint of meat to it. I pull out my GPS mapping device and drop a pin on my location. I start off towards my camp. ""Il come back tomorrow and check on this."" I thought to myself. It was getting late in the afternoon and it's not fun or good to be bumbling around in the dark.  After getting back to my camp I put my gear away in my tent and started my small campfire, got my evening meal ready. The entire night the flaming pit was on my mind. Nothing about it felt right. I went to sleep in my tent thinking tomorrow Il go back and check out the site before I head back to society. Maybe I'll catch whoever started it. I woke up at 6am and poked at the coals in my small pit. Once I got the fire going again I brewed some water for coffee and my breakfast. After I finished I packed up my camp and stacked my gear in a nice bundle. I grabbed my day pack and my gps device and headed towards the spot I marked yesterday. I'll come back for the rest of my gear after I do my lil adventure. I get to the pit in a decent amount of time, the sun goden orange in sky. I glance at my watch 8:30am. I do as I did yesterday. I approach slowly and keep in the woodline. Nothing changed. No sighn of any movement, no sighn of anything other than a smoldering pit. Everything was burned down and the flames were gone. I step out after about 10mns of looking around and look down at the remains. I turn around and grab a decent size stick from the brush, for poking ,and walk into the black burnt smoking hole. After overturning a few burnt branches and some decent sized limbs the flames started to slowly come back to life as the embers hit fresh air. I turn around and get out as the smoke and heat started to make my eyes water. ""Shit, I didn't Wana start it back up"" I thought. As I walk out of the center. I turn around wiping my eyes and stuffy the now small fire I reanimated. That's when I saw it. On the other side of the limbs I rolled over there was a black human arm, charred black and melted to the bone. ""Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!"" I started to panic. I turned around and started to leave but then a thought hit me. ""It can't be."" I turn back around."" I better make sure and call this in!"" I walk back into the pit and start poking around with the stick again. I stuck the stick under the arm and lifted. The appendage lifted, burnt and some meat on the upper arm separated revealing bone. I dropped the stick and bolted out of the pit and towards the woodline. My mind was racing, my heart was pumping. This was something I have never encountered before. I had heard of people coming across body's of hikers and campers that have gotten lost, but nothing like this. I got back to my camp site at 10:30 and grabbed my gear and checked my satellite phone. The battery was mostly charged. I called the forest service and told them everything as I made my way back out of the wilderness. I gave them coordinates and said I would meet them at the trail head I came in from. All the while losing my emotions and panicking. I got to the trail head I came in on around 6pm. I was exhausted. By then the adrenaline wore off and the panic subsided. There where 2 rangers at my truck waiting for me. After about an hr or so of me recounting the experience and showing some pictures I took with my phone. They let me leave and said they would be in touch...this all happened 3 years ago. To this day I haven't heard back from anyone and when I call and check they say it's still an open case and can't discuss details. I no longer do that job. I don't camp or fish anymore.

I need to get this guilt off my chest before I send myself into a panic attack.

I work at a caf√©, we specialize in modern 3rd wave coffee. We have a small menu and a pastry case. 95% of our pastries are bought in, but there are two things we make in house.

We had a parent and teen come in, asking if we had anything gluten free. We have one gluten free item, so I pointed to it. I always mention cross contamination risk because only our owner is ServSafe certified, our cooks aren't. I should mention we don't have managers and the owners never come in on weekends. They ask about nuts and I mention this item has peanut butter. They specifically ask if there's tree nuts and I say no, but can't guarantee with cross contamination. They ask about cross contamination with steam wands, and I give them a rundown of our cleaning processes, but still can't guarantee a 100% risk free hot drink, and offer to make an iced version or a flavored drip so the milk doesn't touch the steam wands. They went forward with a latte anyway, and ordered the gluten free item.

After they left, I checked our recipe book out of sheer curiosity since I always wondered what exactly was in them. Unbeknownst to me, the gluten free item has almonds. I genuinely had zero idea. I have worked there over 2 years. Another more senior employee was there and also believes there's no tree nuts. I genuinely don't think anyone else knows they have almonds. I feel like such a shit person. I feel like I poisoned someone and now I fear getting fired over this if they call the store. I tried to find out the name so I could contact them, but our system doesn't keep track of that and they've never been in before so no one recognized them.

I would never intentionally harm someone. This guilt has been eating away at me since it happened. I haven't told anyone IRL yet because I fear the consequences.",7,1739781662.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.74,False

I‚Äôm single, live alone (childless cat lady here lol), and I work a lot and a pretty odd schedule so it makes meeting people pretty difficult. 

I don‚Äôt know if what I‚Äôm looking for even exists, or why I keep trying. But dating apps don‚Äôt work for me and I always like to have hope, so I guess I‚Äôll keep trying. I‚Äôve achieved a level of peace in my life I‚Äôm quite happy with, but I do admit I miss companionship, connection, caring and feeling cared for, checking in with one another, true emotional intimacy. I‚Äôm always open to possibilities and seeing how relationships develop, but I also understand a lot of relationships serve particular purposes and are fleeting, and this doesn‚Äôt make them less significant.

What I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶I‚Äôm very weary of boring, below bare minimum effort people. I love intellectual stimulation. I love sincerity and enthusiasm. I love someone who is passionate, driven, a person with talents and hobbies. I want to be attracted to someone, and for them to be attracted to me. I‚Äôm an artist, witchy, leftist, intellectual, philosophical, in love with life and all it has to offer. Intellectual engagement and stimulating conversation are some of my greatest pleasures, and I‚Äôd love to have more of it in my life. I‚Äôve recently been on a big journey of self discovery and spiritual development. Psychedelic plant medicine, meditation, and Tantra have been integral in my journey, and I‚Äôd love to talk to someone else who has experience or interest in these areas.

I love art in all its forms (all my greatest loves have also been artists), love film, especially animation and horror, indie comics, reading, antiquing, crafts, love nature and go on frequent hikes. I love the mountains, travel, coffee shops, museums, and trying out new recipes while I listen to records. My comfort shows are MST3K, What We Do in the Shadows, Monty Python, and YouTube videos of Adult Swim broadcasts from the early 00‚Äôs.

If any of this sounds appealihng, feel free to message me! Please give me a short introduction instead of just ‚Äúhi,‚Äù so I have a jumping off point for a conversation :)",1,1739780856.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Robert Dixon Dunn is a serial murderer and fraud. Dunn committed multiple crimes, including murder and identity fraud, keeping the bodies of two elderly victims, the Sierras, in a Las Vegas storage unit from 2003 to 2015 while stealing their social security benefits. He used [ancestry.com](http://ancestry.com) to find deceased individuals' information for fraud. He is now facing the death penalty.

HE IS STILL SITTING IN JAIL AWAITING TRIAL! A cornucopia of cancellations and reschedulings of meetings and trial dates have been involved and he has managed to manipulate the court system to HIS advantage. The Clark County court system has done nothing but delay and double-book trials.

I unknowingly married Dunn in 2008 under his false identity. Shortly after, he revealed his crimes and subjected me to daily abuse and death threats if I told anyone. Despite multiple 911 calls in 2010 warning authorities, they dismissed my claims. After he abandoned me in 2011 and went on the run, no one believed me until 2015, when social security agents investigated. I provided key information leading to the discovery of the bodies, and authorities credited me with cracking the case. Dunn was arrested in 2015 and now faces the death penalty. 

With the exception of one outlet, Desert Companion, the media has done a piss poor job at shedding light on this 22 year old murder case. An article with my interview was released in October 2024 explaining the pitfalls of the criminal justice system on the death penalty and the delays it causes along with the emotional impact on the victims.

An article with my interview was released in October 2024 explaining the pitfalls of the criminal justice system on the death penalty and the delays it causes along with the emotional impact on the victims.

On a personal note, I‚Äôm facing another heartbreaking challenge: my boyfriend of 11 years was diagnosed in September with aggressive, inoperable stomach cancer and it‚Äôs spread to other organs. Despite his deteriorating condition, he has supported me throughout and wants me to find closure so I can finally share my story.

A silver lining‚ÄîI‚Äôm finally divorced!

Once again, I‚Äôm asking you to push the Clark County court to get their shit and calendars in order and share this information with whoever you can. Here‚Äôs their contact information:

Criminal Investigator Jamie Honaker (702) 671-2829

Clark County DA: Steve Wolfson 702-671-2700

Public defender Scott Coffee (702) 455-4685

Carli Kierny - Dept. II Judge (702) 671-4318

1irf2q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1irf2q8/called_it_off_but_relapsing_hard/,called it off but relapsing hard,"I (28) broke up with my partner (36) yday. We were having coffee outside (he‚Äôs here for 1 month) and noticed he was hiding his phone from me. That‚Äôs when I knew he was replying to his ex who was asking about the font of their freelance logo gig they did together last 2023. It was his ex of 15yrs. I felt betrayed but went home and locked myself up to breakdown and process it, also to come to terms with how I‚Äôd deal with it before talking to him, cos it was borderline a dealbreaker for me (hiding it).

When I asked him if I can look at his phone, he got very defensive and said no twice but eventually gave in. That‚Äôs when he told me him and his ex met last January 9th, without me knowing. I backread that day and he told me he took a work shift. That was his excuse. He fabricated a detailed lie about how his ‚Äúwork‚Äù went that day.

His reason: he wanted to see their dog and that he wanted closure.

Asked him a couple of things and that‚Äôs when I knew he isnt willing to cut his ex off cos he said ‚Äúim not that kind of person who will cutoff ppl even if they hurt me‚Äù.

The entire relationship, there were multiple instances that they talked, they updated each other bout how their life is going and some sort of comfort ‚Äútry not to stress about this and that‚Äù. I couldnt read everything cos it hurt so much.

I just know that leaving him is the right decision, but idk how to deal with the relapses. I know he genuinely loves me, but imho, you cannot love someone if you‚Äôre still so unwilling to leave all the baggage behind. Im lost and yapping here idk if I make sense. My mind is so clouded. I feel shocked and overwhelmed. Everything was so amazing, until he chose to be a coward to come clean. Still cant believe this man looked me in the eyes the past 3 weeks and said he loves me but wasn‚Äôt haunted by guilt.

1irf1nu,https://v.redd.it/8xqu7xw9rnje1,Grinding Noise After Completion [DF64 Gen 2],"Hi everyone,

I have a question about my DF64 Gen 2 grinder. After the grinding process is complete and all the coffee has passed through, I often hear a noise that sounds like the burrs are rubbing against each other. However, as you can see in the video, if I adjust the grind finer while the motor is still running and then return it to the original position, the noise disappears.

This makes me think that a coffee bean might be getting stuck somewhere. It happens in about 70‚Äì80% of my grinding sessions, and I can always fix it in the same way.

I‚Äôm wondering if this could indicate a defect in my grinder, if it‚Äôs just a stuck bean, or if it‚Äôs an issue with the burr alignment. Has anyone experienced something similar?

I‚Äôd appreciate any insights or suggestions!

Best regards,
Chris

I know it's just a holiday but I believe anything is possible if I had to change my life I'd forgive all my mistakes . And if I could turn back time but I can't.  I'd like animals and pets.
