1iwaw54,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1iwaw54/redcoffee_for_github_actions_a_practical_solution/,RedCoffee for GitHub Actions: A Practical Solution for CI/CD SonarQube Reporting,"# What does my project do?

RedCoffee is a CLI tool written in Python that helps developers generate detailed SonarQube code analysis reports in PDF format. This is particularly useful for teams using SonarQube Community Edition, which lacks built-in PDF report generation.

With RedCoffee for GitHub Actions, this process is further streamlined. By integrating RedCoffee into CI/CD pipelines, developers can automate report generation without worrying about manual execution. Simply add a block of code in your GitHub Actions YAML file, and the PDF report will be available in the artifacts section of GitHub Actions.

# My motivation behind building this project

I've talked about RedCoffee quite a few times on this sub before, and the response from developers has been pretty good. Many reached out with feature requests, and one of the most common was GitHub Actions integration. A developer + product owner pointed out that developers often prefer to access reports directly in the CI/CD pipeline, rather than running a separate tool.

That idea made sense. Automation should work for the developer, not the other way around.

# Using RedCoffee for Github Actions

Using RedCoffee for GitHub Actions is straightforward. We just need to add the following block of code in our actions.yaml file

    - name: Use RedCoffee for Github Actions
      uses: Anubhav9/redcoffee-for-github-actions@v1.4

# What is the underlying implementation?

The implementation follows a structured and reliable approach, leveraging Docker, PostgreSQL, and SonarQube to handle the reporting process. The action.yaml file, available in the repository, defines the workflow:

1. Checkout the code from the repository.
2. Create a Docker network to facilitate container communication.
3. Start a PostgreSQL database and configure the required environment variables.
4. Deploy SonarQube Community Edition and connect it to the database.
5. Wait for SonarQube to fully initialize, update credentials, and generate an API token.
6. Run SonarScanner to analyze the codebase.
7. Install RedCoffee from PyPi.
8. Run RedCoffee CLI to generate a SonarQube analysis report in PDF format.
9. Store the PDF report in the GitHub Artifacts section for easy access.

# Who is the target audience for this project?

* Developers & engineering teams using SonarQube Community Edition who need automated PDF reports.
* CI/CD engineers looking to integrate SonarQube reporting into their workflows.
* Indie hackers & open-source contributors interested in building their own GitHub Actions.

# Limitations for this project

Despite its capabilities, RedCoffee for GitHub Actions has a few known limitations:

1. Language Support – Python is fully supported. JavaScript mostly works, but occasional errors occur (a fix is in progress). Java and Go support are planned, pending further testing.
2. API Response Issues – Sometimes, the SonarQube API fails to respond on time, leading to report generation failures. A retry mechanism will be added in the next release.
3. SonarQube Community Edition Limitations – By default, SonarQube analysis runs only on the main/master branch. A workaround exists and has been tested, and it will be rolled out in a future update.

**Installing RedCoffee as Standalone CLI**

Goes without saying that if you want to use RedCoffee directly as a standalone CLI, please install it via Pypi. The command for the same is given below

    pip install redcoffee==1.8

Provided your analysis has been completed, you can use the following command to generate the PDF report

    redcoffee generatepdf --host=${YOUR_SONARQUBE_HOST_NAME} --project=${SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY} --path=${PATH WHERE PDF FILE IS TO BE STORED} --token=${SONARQUBE_USER_TOKEN}

**A request to fellow developers**

Building RedCoffee and integrating it into GitHub Actions has been a challenging but rewarding experience. If you find this project useful, consider starring the repository on GitHub.

Have been in great health with the exception of hypertension and insomnia. I’ve had two sleep tests done. One said I’ve slept for 4.8 hours and the other said I slept for 6 and a half hours. Both tests said I fell asleep in 10 minutes.

My problem is I don’t agree with the test stating I fell asleep in 10 minutes. I know for a fact that I tossed and turned for 2-3 hours. And I also don’t agree with the amount of time it says I’ve slept for. I slept for 3-4 hours. Not 6 and a half hours.

Has anyone had sleep tests done and not agreed with the results. Also, in my opinion my body doesn’t reflect sleeping for 4.8 hours or 6 and a half hours as I have trouble with energy throughout the day.

Looking for some second opinions here. Grew up in the SF Bay Area, attended university in the Los Angeles area and lived there about 7 years total. Social life definitely dwindled after college, and many people around my age in LA (or at least in the film/ent. industry) come off as inauthentic social climbers. Yes I know that’s not *everybody*…maybe I’m not looking in the right places?

Anyways, am currently in Portland, OR and while the coffee, fresh air and natural beauty are quite unmatched, I don’t see myself staying here much longer. The constant gray skies are rather depressing and the lack of diversity isn’t exactly welcoming as a Black guy. 

Right now considering Austin, TX and Chicago, IL (though I’ve never actually been.) Been to Austin but only for two days so I didn’t see much, but everyone seemed friendly. Tried New York City for a few months but found it to be too dense/crowded for my liking. Would prefer warmer weather but if I need to put on some layers a few months out of the year, so be it. 

Work/Income: I’m a freelance photographer and filmmaker (hence Los Angeles) on top of running an online business so I can essentially work from anywhere. 2500 max budget for a studio or 1bd. 

Just looking for community really. I’m a straight Black guy, if that means anything. Would be cool to find a partner. Thanks in advance for any additional suggestion or input! ",3,1740319303.0,SameGrassButGreener,0,1.0,False

1iwar0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwar0m/have_you_upgraded_your_alarm_system_recently/,Have you upgraded your alarm system recently?,"

That was the sales pitch. I had been unloading some boxes when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door there was a 20 something year old standing there with a blue collared shirt that read “Pristine Alarms”. 

  


“Hello Sir, have you upgraded your alarm system recently?”

  


With a friendly smile I said. “We actually don’t currently have one installed, we just moved in.”

  


“Talk about perfect timing! My name is Matt and I work for Pristine Alarms we specialize in home security. We have doorbell cameras, interior cameras, exterior cameras, automatic locks, and alarm systems. Everything to keep you and your family safe!”

  


“I appreciate the offer Matt but we have so much going on right now I don’t have the brain capacity to think about this.”

  


“I completely understand, feel free to think about it and contact me if you have any questions. I will leave you my card with my personal number on it and if you’re interested just give me a call and we can set you up!”

  


And with that he was gone. I wasn’t lying I had been doing a million things since we moved in a few days ago. I had just taken a promotion which unfortunately required a relocation. The kids weren’t too happy but they were still young so had plenty of time to make some new friends and start over. My wife has been great about this whole thing. She supported the move even though we knew it wasn’t going to be easy and was going to be a pain to start over. Later that night during our latest round of fast food I mentioned the alarm system pitch I was offered and asked her thoughts on it. 

  


“I mean, I think this is a pretty safe neighborhood but I wouldn’t mind getting one. It will give us peace of mind for when we aren’t home or when we’re sleeping.”

  


“Yeah, you’re not wrong honey. It would put us at ease. I will call the guy tomorrow and see when we can set it up.”

  


Early the next morning I gave Matt a call. I figured even if he didn’t answer I could leave a message and he would get back to me. To my surprise he answered after the first ring.

  


“Hello, this is Matt with Pristine Alarms. How can I help you.”

  


“Hey Matt, this is Phil. You stopped by yesterday, I’m over on-“

  


“Yes of course I remember, just moved in right? How can I help you Phil?”

  


“Well after talking it over with my other half we decided we need an Alarm system. We feel safe but a little added security won’t hurt.”

  


“Excellent! Because you just moved in, I would love to offer you a discount!” 

  


“Really? That would be amazing. What are we thinking?”

  


“2 interior cameras for main living area and hallway, 2 exterior cameras for front and back sides of the house, 2 automatic locks for the front and back door, doorbell camera and keypad! How does $500 for all that sound?!”

  


“500, oh that’s a little steep. On top of a monthly service that’s a little too much for us.”

  


“I’ll wave the monthly fee! Just the initial cost and no monthly expenses. We want to make sure you choose us!”

  


“Wow, DEAL! I really appreciate this Matt. When can we set up this installation? I just have to make sure someone is-“

  


“How does right now sound?! I just had a cancellation and I’m not too far away. I can come by right now and start the install. I should have all the items I promised in the work Van.”

  


“Uhh yeah that would be amazing, this is my last day off before I start my job so this works out perfect.”

  


“Awesome, I’ll see you soon Phil.”

  


Within 5 minutes I saw a van pull up to my house. I thought to myself “Damn, that was fast.” But didn’t think much of it. I opened the front door and there was Matt in his blue polo. He gave me a wave and continued on to the back of the van. I didn’t notice anyone else in the van. Was another one coming. Is he going to do this entire install by himself? Sure enough Matt exited the back of the van with a ladder, tool belt and camera in hand. 

  


“I’m going to start on the front and back cameras then I can move on to the interior. If you have any errands to run feel free, this is going to take me a while.”

  


While I wasn’t too keen on the idea of leaving the house I did have some things to do. The kids were at school and my wife was at work. She was a manager at a department store and was able to make a lateral transfer to a store near our new home. I had to go to the post office and pick up some paint for my home office. I decided to take care of my plans and figured I’d be back within the hour. 

  


As I pulled back up to the house I saw Matt putting the ladder away. While I closed the car door Matt approached me. 

  


“Alright Phil the exterior is done, I was able to to install the doorbell camera as well. I’m ready to move on to the interior when you are!” He said excitedly

  


“Great, follow me and let me know if you need anything.”

  


I entered the house and Matt quickly followed behind. I headed towards the office while Matt started to set up the cameras and keypad. I wanted to get a head start on painting the office because I knew I started work the next day. 

  


About and hour and a half later, I had just finished applying the first coat when Matt called out to me. 

  


“Hey Phil! All done! Just have to install the app on your phone and you will be able to access the cameras, keypad, and locks directly from your phone.”

  


“Awesome, thanks again! Is there some place I can leave you a review or call your boss or anything? You’ve been great and I’d love to rave about you.” I said as I chuckled.

  


Matt turned to me suddenly. “No. Uh no it’s alright just doing my job.”

  


“Okay? Uhh anyway what’s the app?”

  


“May I?” Matt reached out his open hand.

  


I handed him the phone without thinking. I had a big day ahead and just wanted to be finished. Within 30 seconds Matt had downloaded the app and handed my phone back to me.

  


“All set! I put the app on your Home Screen! Click the big blue “P.A” and it will bring you to your door bell camera. You can cycle through each camera by clicking the camera icon. Your door can be unlocked with a push of the lock icon, and your keypad can be used by, you guessed it, clicking the keypad icon. I set your default code to your house number. To set it just hit “set” and then the code. To turn it off hit “off” and then the code. Pretty simple! Feel free to change it at anytime!”

  


“This is great, thanks again Matt.” I said as we walked towards the door. “ I’ll be sure to spread the word to all the neighbors!”

  


Matt stopped walking.

  


“No no, no need too I already dealt with most of the neighborhood so please don’t mention me.”

  


What a weirdo I thought to myself. “No problem, thanks again!” 

  


As Matt left I walked back to my office to put on the second coat of paint.

  


When my wife and kids got home, I showed them the new cameras and alarm system. The kids couldn’t care less but my wife was impressed with not only the price but the fast installation.

  


“So this guy Matt did all this today by himself? Damn thats pretty impressive.”

  


“That’s exactly what I was thinking. The app is great, I can unlock the door from anywhere and can check on the cameras when we aren’t home. You should download it too babe.” 

  


We looked it up on her phone but for some reason couldn’t find it. We searched up Pristine Alarms, P.A, even searched Alarm apps but couldn’t find anything. I told her I’d give Matt a call in the morning and get it figured out. 

  


I went to bed that night excited to start my new job but surprisingly I was able to fall asleep pretty fast. Unfortunately my rest only lasted for a few hours. We were woken up by the sound of a blaring siren. For a split second I had no idea what was happening. I jumped up from bed and ran straight to the door. “Did someone try to come in?” My wife said as I looked through the window. I saw nothing. I checked the back door and windows. Once again, nothing. Once I got my bearings I headed for the keypad. I hit the “off” button and put our house number in. The words “access denied” popped up on the screen. I tried again, same message. By this point my family was behind me and starting to get annoyed.

  


“Whats going on?” My wife said.

  


“I have no idea, it wont turn off, it keeps saying access denied.” 

  


“Here let me try.” 

  


“Hit the off button and then put our house number in.”

  


She did just that. The sirens stopped. I stood there confused. Did I enter it wrong? I mean I’m out of it, sure but I know I entered it in correctly. 

  


After our hearts stopped racing we all headed back to bed. On the way to work I was going to call Matt and figure out the alarm situation. 

  


I got ready and downed a cup of coffee. I was EXHAUSTED. I called him on the way to the office. One ring and then an answer.

  


“Hey Phil, I recognized your number. What can I do for you?”

  


“Hey Matt. We are having some trouble with the alarm. It went off randomly last night and when I entered the code it didn’t turn off.”

  


“Hmm, thats strange. I can come by and check it out. Maybe run a couple of tests.”

  


“Sure, what is a good time for you?”

  


“I know you said you had work today? Is anyone home right now? I have some time before my first job”

  


“Yeah my wife, I will call her and let her know you will be stopping by to fix the issue, i appreciate it.”

  


I called home and let my wife know Matt will be coming by. She was a little annoyed that she had to put on real clothes instead of pajamas but understood it needed to be done.

  


5 minutes later I got a notification on my phone that someone was at the front door. I opened the alarm app and saw the doorbell camera. It was Matt. That was fast. My wife opened the door and let Matt inside. I closed the app and headed into the office. 

  


On my lunch break I decided to call home. 

  


“Hey honey, hows your first day?” My wife asked.

  


“It is good darling, hows your day off? Did Matt fix the problem?”

  


“He is actually still here he said there was some sort of software issue.”

  


It had already been a few hours. He installed everything in less than 3. How does a software issue take more time. I told my wife I’d call her back. I wanted to know what was taking so long. I called Matt. No answer.

  


I called again. No answer.

  


What the hell is going on. The guy answers on the first ring every time I call. Now no answer at all. I decided to check the cameras. The front camera showed his van was still there. I cycled through the cameras. My wife was sitting on the couch watching t.v. I switch to the hallway camera. No sign of Matt. I was just about to switch to the back camera when I saw him. He was exiting our bedroom. I immediately called my wife.

  


“What the fuck is he doing in our room?!”

  


“What are you talking about he is by the keypad.”

  


“No he is not I just saw him walking out of our room!”

  


Thats when I got another call. It was Matt. I told my wife he was calling and I had to go.

  


“What the fuck do you think you’re doing walking around my house?”

  


“Phil I don’t appreciate you talking to me that way. For your information I was installing window sensors. I felt it was the least I can do for the inconvenience of the alarm going off last night.”

  


“Oh, uhh sorry, it just looked, well it just looked weird. You coming out of the bedroom like that.”

  


“Are you watching me Phil? Haha good to know the cameras work well. Don’t be concerned, the alarm is working perfectly now and your wife was great company. I’ll head out now. Enjoy your day Phil.”

  


“Uhh, thanks Matt sorry for blowing up like that.”

  


He had already hung up. 

  


After work I headed straight home, when the kids went to sleep I spoke to my wife about the window sensors. I told her he installed them free of charge. She was thankful but thought it was strange he didn’t mention it to her.

  


The next few days went smooth. Work was starting great, the family was settling in day by day and there weren’t any more issues with the alarm system. 

  


Until my wife and I decided to have a date night. 

  


We wanted to treat ourselves. The move was overwhelming and it was time for us to enjoy ourselves. We were just going out to dinner. The kids were old enough to be by themselves for a few hours plus we would be able to have eyes on them and the house with the cameras. 

  


We got all fancied up. We headed to a well reviewed steakhouse and were just enjoying each others company. That’s when I got a notification on my phone. “Front door unlocked.”

I looked at my wife puzzled and showed her my phone. She called the kids right away and I checked the doorbell camera. No one there. I was going through the other cameras and saw nothing. Then another notification. “Back door unlocked.” My wife was on the phone.

  


“Did you unlock the door?” She put it on speaker.

  


“No? We are doing homework and watching tv.”

  


“Check the doors make sure they are locked”

  


“Okay. I locked them. Is everything okay?”

  


“Yes everything is fine we just got a notification that the doors had been unlocked.”

  


She looked at me.

  


I said “Maybe the system is messing up again.”

  


“Maybe but I feel weird now, we should go.”

  


Just as I asked for the check. Another notification comes through. “There’s motion at the front door.” I check. No one there. I begin to check the cameras once again. Thats when I see the van. Matt’s van. What the hell?

  


“There’s motion at the back door.”

  


I cycle through. There is Matt standing by my back door.

  


“Back door unlocked.”

  


What the fuck.

  


I tell my wife we need to go now. 

  


“There’s motion at the front door.”

  


“Front door unlocked”

  


I call Matt. 

  


“Hello Phil”

  


“Matt what the fuck are you doing?”

  


“Just checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.”

  


“What? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-“

  


“Calm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I’m gonna take off now.”

  


I looked at my wife ”Call the cops, now!”

  


I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

  


When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched “Pristine Alarms” nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn’t much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

  


My wife and the kids stayed “home” the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn’t until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn’t have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

  


I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

  


I ran to enter the code.

  


“Access denied”

  


I tried again.

  


“Access denied”

  


“There’s motion at the back door”

  


The siren stopped.

  


My phone rang.

  


“Hi there Phil, I see you’re home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.”

  


I didn’t say a word.

  


“Phil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I’m just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.”

  


“Who the fuck are you, “Pristine Alarms” isn’t even a real fucking company.”

  


“C’mon now Philly, I work hard at my job.”

  


“Listen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.”

  


“I just wanna make sure you’re safe.”

  


He hung up.

  


“Front door unlocked.”

  


I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That’s when the back door swung open. 

  


By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

  


“DON’T FUCKING MOVE!” The police must’ve been called by one of the neighbors.

  


My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

  


Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That’s when I noticed the all too familiar “Pristine Alarms” van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

  


I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.

Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

  


My phone rang.

  


I answered.

My dad used to have one and i wondered what hapoend to it. He said he broke and he threw it away but hz dit have an older analog camera. He went to search for it in the attic.

A few moments later he came with a tiny camera. He had used it when he was 20ish and is now 65years old. He said he's sure it still worked, he showed how the mechanics worked and how it should be used. He said it was expensive back in the days to develop and probably is now even more expensive. 

I asked my dad why he used that camera, it seems older than 45 years. The camera was used by my grandfather. He took 1 picture every month and made a book out of the pictures. The anekdote that really blew my mind was that my grandfather traded the camera for 1 kilo coffee with a German back in the second world war!!

I would really love to use the camera for indoor pictures of my family but a first google search didn't gave me the wanted results. 

Can i find a film for this camera? In de camera there's a picture thats says pernox film. I don't find anything on that. Second question: How do i develop?

I hope there will be helpful answers.

My father has been homeless for awhile and with rent prices as crazy as they are he would rather sleep in a 2005 mazda 2 instead of look for a house or even room to rent.

He also wants to retire in a few years and go prospecting so I thought a better idea for him is to start building up a van to live in, that way he can travel and have all the comforts of a room on wheels.

We are looking at LWB high roof vans at the moment, first van is more of a test vehicle to see what works and what doesn't as well as get some ideas on the best layout that gives the least amount of compromises.

I need some tips however, new to jamming a house in the back of a van in working order so want to make sure I get some recommendations before I go overboard.

Primarily the problem I am trying to wrap my head around the most is the power related systems; 

I want to chuck a mini split system on the van to cool the living space for when it gets hot.

Also allow enough headroom for a couple hours TV use during the night as well as running a kettle or slow cooker for coffee or meals.

Do I build out the solar system to cover the max draw of the AC? (In case the AC needs to sit at full blast for a extended period of time to fight the harsh Australian outback) 

With **L**iFePo4 batteries and inverters, what setup would happily deal with high draw appliances like kettles and toasters being used back to back? 

Whats the best solution for plugging into mains power when available? Ideally I would prefer if this van rarely needed to but the option to charge up or just layabout a powered lot in a caravan park would be nice on occasion.

1iwaiie,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iwaiie/dismissive_avoidantnarcissistic_traits_breakup/,Dismissive avoidant/narcissistic traits breakup,"Can anyone give me any insight please. Would a spouse who is a dismissive avoidant/ narcissistic personality traits act like this? Or is it something else? 

I'm trying to figure out which they might be. It doesn't matter because I've gone for good now and am not going back to this awful cycle but I'm curious to try to understand the behaviour.

Short marriage 18 months and 4 yrs relationship.
very regularly sabotaged by spouse breaking promises,
meeting own needs over relationship needs or mine every time,
dismissing my needs and feelings, not being transparent, 
obsessive hobbies and addiction to alcohol that they'd absorb themselves in taking up evenings and weekends ( even before the relationship began) but I stupidly thought this would subside after marriage because of promises, 
Recent changed fantasies about how their ex spouse was nice (despite them cheating and taking them for everything they had including parental alienation), 
building a stronger bond recently with ex spouse and both turning against me - throughout ex wanted to have my spouse's attention and bombard with crank calls on special occasions for me and my spouse (not about the kids, about their own needs) although the ex is also remarried, I suspected sabotage and asked it to stop- big mistake as it led to the events below and things getting much worse, 
needed control over marital home and possessions ( it's all mine attitude), had to be the boss at work( would never work under anyone else), 
blame shifting, gaslighting, 
denial when confronted, 
promises of change after no contact, 
couldn't easily take accountability or apologise unless separated for months with no or low contact, 
Was messaging another ex from the past as 'friends' behind my back for the first 8 months of the relationship, despite me saying how important transparency was for me.
They had physically attacked me once when very drunk during an argument. 

I left last year for 6 months because of many things to do with my spouse's behaviour above. Even after going back to my spouse after them promising changes, and reading a couple of relationship books, taking accountability and apologising saying they realised their mistakes etc how it would never happen again, they recently deliberately went against their word. This is 2 months after going back.

I'd asked for many changes but one was the crank calling episodes from their attention seeking ex spouse to stop because it was always about their needs and not the needs of the kids. I found it rude and intrusive. My spouse had agreed and had promised to put in healthy boundaries about necessary contact- to get me back. 
When the ex spouse crank called again recently, my spouse refused to deal with it or put in the healthy boundaries and became very upset with for what I'd asked for. 

The ex spouse, who had found out about what I was asking for, then started a campaign of calling and messaging multiple times daily and crank calling my spouse to prove a point to me,they also threatened to stop the kids visiting us and has been manipulating the kids telling them I'm nasty and they shouldn't talk to me. They said to my spouse "" we were married a long time, you can't forget that I matter to you"". All because I'd asked for the healthy contact boundaries and no crank calling. 

 My spouse just enabled it, responded to their ex spouse everytime to appease them and dismissed and stonewalled me at home after I confronted them about what they had promised and began drinking heavily again. They both blamed me calling me insecure and controlling. I just wanted to have marriage that was not intruded or sabotaged and to be respected a bit. 

My spouse took no accountability for breaking their promise and said there was no problem with the ex spouse contacting like that and they wanted them to and said it wasn't crank calling (10-20 calls in a day in a row).  Complete flip on what they had said to get me back! They had previously said how annoying the crank calling and demands for personal attention were. I did get very angry admittedly. They then threatened to make my life a living hell, if I didn't leave the home and they got physical out of anger and rage. 

I left. The next day they told me to collect my things and my adult kid's things or they'd put them outside because they wanted to get their house ( marital home, all in their name because that's what they would only allow) in order and move on.

I was blindsided but had not been naive enough to think this couldn't happen because it had before. I guess I wanted to give them a chance but always knew that if changes didn't happen that would be it, my boundary was set.

I collected my things and oddly noticed anything I had chosen for the house had been thrown out or removed and they had got all of their old things back out eg the new coffee cup I'd bought them was gone and their old cracked one ( which the ex spouse had bought them) was being used again. They had been upset that I'd bought them a new one and said I was controlling them by buying them a new one.

This was the same story for anything I wanted to get them even as a gift, if the ex had bought it, it was almost cherished despite how old it was. Strange thing is they say they really dislike the ex and wouldn't even look at them if they were the last person on Earth. They say they know they are manipulative, entitled and attention seeking and alienate the children but in the next breath say the opposite. Very confusing!!

Spouse calls me insecure for noticing what I notice about them and their ex and asking for boundaries. I think I'm right to expect them to be healthier. I'm not insecure, they work with lots of people of the opposite sex and go away for nights with work- doesn't bother me. But yes, this ex wife thing made me uncomfortable because it was just a too clingy in many ways. I felt they hadn't moved on after 5 years. 

Spouse says I don't trust them but I should, no matter what they have done or do. I disagree!

 I'm called controlling, if I buy them anything new or suggest something new or a change, it's like I have to answer 20 questions as to why. 

It feels like they are clinging onto their past and fantasising about it but also must desperately have their independence in everything, even if their behaviour choices and actions hurt me.

When we first met it was "" my ex was so nasty, entitled, controlling, manipulative..."" and I was treated like a queen and idolised - for a short while. They were paronoid about doing anything wrong and constantly asked me if their behaviour made me happy and how I must tell them if they ever did anything to upset me. I now see why...


I literally can't understand any of it. I think what did I do wrong? The only things could be that I expected them not to behave like that with their ex spouse - which I still think is fine to expect. They had promised me they would set healthy boundaries with their ex spouse before I came back after leaving the first time but in reality, it was just a lie. 

It feels like they drew me back in with promises of change and then just repeated the same actions deliberately to drive me away again shortly after. I can't understand why they'd do such a thing. It's pointless and destructive. 

This person was saying how much they loved me and wanted a family with me just the day before I discovered they'd broken their promise and called them out. It's a reaction to them getting held to account. They now say they want a divorce but it's in a half-hearted way as if testing me and to upset me/punish me because I really tried and desperately wanted the marriage to work. I tried too much! I'm getting a divorce, I have to I think. 

I thankfully had a place to go to but it's not furnished or a home. I just feel like my spouse had been very cruel but also kept thinking am I to blame? Was I controlling by buying some new things as gifts for them? Was I wrong to expect contact between them and ex spouse to be when necessary only and only really about the kids ( who are not babies or very young) instead of about the ex spouse's personal needs and multiple times a day every day or through crank calling? It felt like they were spouses still instead of me. 

What behaviour is that? I know it's not healthy! Any ideas? I've never come across it before in my life. I'm left feeling was it me because I've been told by them that I was the problem. It messes with your sense of reality. 

On the flip side my spouse was very attentive to the housework and to buying me flowers and showing affection and being loving, when times were good in between these episodes of poor treatment.It would be good, then fade away and then they'd do something really drastic to destroy the relationship. It was a cycle like that.

Carter Nash tore posters off the bulletin board mounted at the dilapidated skate park behind the railroad tracks. Most of them advertised skateboard gear, quick eats, and online dating. A handful were for homegrown basement bands featuring gothic graphics of trance-inducing music and lead singers with single-word stage names. These he inspected closely and, deciding they were worthless, let them flutter to the ground. He slapped the bare corkboard with a dull thud. Little tacks and pieces of tape surrounded his feet.

“Nothin,” he said to Bridger, who stood on the edge of the snow-blanketed skate bowl staring out over the industrial mess toward the towers of Asiatown.

“Map says there’s another skate park over there.” Bridger pointed to the urban jungle of Asiatown rising into the sky.

Nash let out a long, vanishing whistle. “The BAT.”

Stark. Cold. Gray in the matte-light of midday.

“Back east, they talk about it like it’s a black hole built to suck up money and refugees. I never thought… You’ve got to see it to believe it.”

“They figure ten million. There’s more hiding under the radar. People need a place to go.”

“It’s just so out of place out here in the middle of nowhere,” said Bridger.

“It ain’t the middle of nowhere. You’ve got a half-dozen national parks an hour drive from here. Concrete jungle meets the savage wilderness.”

Bridger crunched on the snow back to Ol’ Betsy. Stopping at Nash’s mess, he said, “Pick up your trash.”

***

Nash drove Ol’ Betsy three blocks into the unofficial Asiatown district and parked next to a Korean mini mart. They continued on foot. It had been ten years since he’d last stepped foot into these labyrinthine corridors, and he was fearful of getting lost along the uncharted roads, many too narrow for the van to pass. There were larger roads, of course, if you had enough money or held the right credentials.

The sidewalk was blocked with vendors wrapped in parkas hawking steaming pots of soups, venting their savory smells into the cold air. His mouth was already salivating.

“It’s a foodie’s paradise,” said Nash. “Wanna stop and get something?”

“Man, I’d feel guilty. Ty loves Chinese,” said Bridger. “Maybe we can take something back.”

They took a road behind a string of restaurants, the heat from their kitchens venting onto their faces. A man in a bloody apron and holding a cleaver smoked at a doorway and watched them without emotion. A kid came out of the next door with his delivery in his arms, secured it in the back of a motorcycle, shouted something in the dialect that Nash vaguely recognized, and zoomed away. The internal combustion engine hung a cloud of blue exhaust in his wake.

Under the Earth Treaty that were older than Nash, the refugee projects—dubbed Asiatowns by the popular but politically incorrect nomenclature—had sprung up around the world in states that believed everyone had a right to a home. It had been the Native American tribes, as sovereign governments, that had tipped the scales and forced the United States to sign on, an act that had ended in Texas declaring its independence.

These urban zones were funded by dark money from foreign treasuries, corporate conglomerates, and underworld crime syndicates. At first, host nations had tried to limit immigration, but as the water kept rising, the people kept coming. When they could no longer expand outward due to legal or geographical boundaries, they started building into the sky.

“You think you can find this skate park in this mess?” Bridger asked.

“We’ll find it. Don’t worry.”

A tuk-tuk pulled up with the trilling tick of an electric motor.

Nash waved him down. “Get in.”

“Oedi?” asked the driver.

“The Cage,” Nash said.

The driver, dark of complexion and wearing sunglasses and a beanie, nodded and was off. Pressed together, they sped through the alley and emerged onto a street where firepits smoked in front of low shanties built of plywood and tin butted against a skyscraper—an anonymous behemoth of BAT’s wealth. Men and women threw offerings onto the flames, and plumes drifted up to ancestors and gods alike. The air was dense with the sweet smell of incense.

The tuk-tuk entered a district of bars and gentlemen’s clubs, punctuated by the occasional pink glow of a companion woman’s cozy room.

“There was a girl here once,” said Nash. “Way back. Good Lord, every time was like your first.”

Bridger laughed. “You ol’ dog.”

“I was a young dog then. Time flies.”

“Hey, yo, hola,” said the driver. “What you want? I get for you! You want girl? You want drug? New Escape L2 legit, the long spin, _ditmai_!” The spiel came on fast and full of dialect—classic Asiatown.

“Just the Cage,” said Nash.

“Sure, okay, but I know girl. She have sister, barely legal, _sibal_!” The tuk-tuk man insisted.

“We cool,” said Bridger.

“You want drug first?”

The driver turned sharply onto a street with other shops and other women in the windows. Perky, sagging, and developing tits, advertisements as old as time. The rosy fronts gradually changed to blue.

“Hey, you want boy?”

Young men, some played VR games shirtless in their heated windows, others danced to electric beats, and others lifted barbells.

Bridger’s mouth and eyes opened agape at the lewd displays.

“Welcome to the BAT,” said Nash. “Wild fuckin west. No fuckin way Allgood’s gonna be able to clean this mess up.”

They took another corner one way and then the other. The tuk-tuk stopped, and they got out. “_Chinguban_, the Cage. My name Khun. You need anything in Asiatown, just let me know. I speak all the languages. Viet, French, Deutsch, Hangul. Pretty Russ ladies? No?” Nash paid the man. Ignoring an offered business card, he pulled Bridger toward the runway leading up into the Cage.

“What’s that?” Bridger asked.

The air was damp and mossy, and the cement beneath their feet had an almost imperceptible vibration.

“That, my friend, is what the locals call the Water Lion, AKA the great Yellowstone River.”

A long metal ramp sloped up to a large open entrance. Someone at the top worked a broom across the floor.

“It used to be an old factory,” said Nash, “one of the godfathers of Asiatown decided to buy it and gift it to the youth. It’s kind of a neutral zone; no gang wars here.”

Bridger’s attention had been drawn to the curb near the ramp. “You see that black car?”

It was a sedan of indeterminable make with blackout windows.

“I see it,” said Nash.

“Before, when I didn’t believe Ty, when I thought he was making shit up, I kept seeing a car just like that one. Sometimes it would be parked right on our street. Sometimes I’d see it in traffic. He tried to tell me there were people after him in that car. I checked it out. Had the registration run. It belonged to some punk. His dad was a freaking heart surgeon or something.”

“You think it’s the hunters?” Nash asked. “Lots of Korean businessmen drive cars like that. Good for business and blowjobs on the fly.”

“But if it’s them… You think they tracked us here?” Bridger asked in a worried voice. His movements becoming agitated.

“Would you recognize a face if you saw it again?”

“I don’t know, but they could recognize me.”

“Okay, come here.” He led the younger man back down the street to a building with a Christmas tree blinking in the entrance.

A young waitress greeted them and took them inside, where another woman in a suit and tie sat at a desk. She wore a transparent VR headset and spoke Cantonese to an invisible and silent interlocutor. She gave no recognition to their presence. The waitress led them through an automatic door that revealed a narrow stairwell reeking of cigarette smoke. They climbed up until the stairs ended under an enormous crystal chandelier. Here, she opened another door with her fingerprint and guided them into a room with a sofa and a coffee table in front of a window that gave an unobstructed view of the street below, the black car, and the entrance to the Cage.

“Please sit down. Can I get you anything?”

“Sweet coffee,” said Nash, “two.”

She bowed. “Anything else? Anything a little more interesting?” She pulled back the lapel of her shirt to reveal a breast with a large dark nipple.

“Dude!” Bridger almost jumped out of his seat, a worried look across his face.

Nash raised an eyebrow at his uptight friend. “We’re okay for now,” he said.

“I’ll leave my menu. Take your time. We’re open all night.” She placed a velvet folder on the coffee table, covered herself, and left the room.

“Is it a coffee house or a whorehouse?”

“Yes.”

“Fuck me.”

“It can be arranged. Life is short, my political operative.”

“Jesus. I still feel married.”

“You’re still a man.”

“So, this is what Pastor Tony and his crew want to get rid of.”

Nash laughed. “They can try. They will fail. Look. You see that back door over there? It’ll take you to the catwalk. You’ll eventually find your way to one of the grand bazaars. And there is your ticket home. Just in case. Be careful. The steps are probably slick as snot on a glass doorknob.”

“I take it you’ve been here before?” Bridger said.

Nash winked. “Enjoy your coffee. Don’t do anything I would do. Did you see that fuckin boob? Perfect as Mount Fuji.”

“You’re going to hell,” Bridger said.

“Watch that black car. Tell me what you see. I’ll call before I come up, just in case you’re balls deep in the Orient.”",1,1740318360.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1iwagdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1iwagdi/simple_signal_based_train_blueprint_poc/,Simple Signal Based Train Blueprint / POC,"2nd try to post this.

This is a VERY simple train signal proof of concept for a lab.

I am all about Vanilla. To a fault. I never got over having a Factorio notepad mod installed and then being denied the Steam all the Way achievement.  I was bad about Vanilla before.  I'm worse now. :)  I just love playing only with what the artists gave me.  No shade for modders, love ya'll.  But I can't do it.  So the lab environment may be weird.  In fact, I've no clue where I learned about the different infinity items in the lab.

Anyway,  4 Interrupts per train, top to bottom:

1. Low Fuel. I am still on coal.  This can be modified to use whatever.
2. \[Liquid or Cargo\] Shunten.  This is what happens when the unloader & picker are full.  What noone seemed to explain well enough for my thicker skull is that the ITEM (cargo) parameter reads \[the first?\] cargo item from the train & passes it on.  The FLUID parameter reads fluid ingredients.  It ends when a picker or unloader is open.
3. \[Liquid or Cargo\] Droppen.  This just drops off cargo if the target \[liquid or cargo\] droppen station is open.
4. Set Cargo \[cargo\].  This is important to queue the train to go to a Picken station.

Bonus shape of the POC blueprint.  Paste it & fuel the trains and it should start running.

I hope this helps someone. :) It took me literally 8 hours and about a gallon of coffee to figure this out.  I shudder to think I'm an IT architect in real life and yet it took me 8 hours of fiddling with this system to figure this trick out.

I wanted to share some of my success tips, as I have been reading on here for my own journey 

- I’ve always weighed in the 120’s lb from ages 18 to 30. If I was lighter, I may be 120-122 and if heavier, 127-129lb. Right before I got pregnant with my first child, I was actually on keto for several months, so I was 120-122lb. 
- I had my first kid in 2021 and second kid in 2023. I gained 45lb with each pregnancy. Thank God, I’ve been able to get back down to about 135lb each time. Once I started to inch towards high 130s, I knew I needed an intervention. 
- I would like to get back to 125lb as I believe that I will feel my best at this weight. 
- Since 3 months ago, I’ve been working out 4 times a week at the gym, usually 3 weight training days and 1 group exercise class. I started out by getting a trainer at the gym for 30 min weekly who kept me accountable and showed me how to approach the weight training. It really helped me to get into a routine and bake the exercise into my schedule. I go to exercise during lunch on Mondays and Wednesdays, group exercise Fridays, and gym w my husband and kids on Saturday mornings as LA fitness has kids club (godsend)!!! 
- I also started to write down my eating. I do intermittent fasting, so I eat 2 meals a day (skip breakfast). I started to eat salad and chicken more consistently and mainly low carb (meat/protein and veggies). I try to keep each meal about 500-600 calories, so I’m within my caloric deficit at 1200 daily. I rate my diet on a scale of 0-5, with 5 being the best. I’ve had some off days, but I would say I’ve been 90-95% good with my diet. 
- I started out at 136lb on 11/15/24, 134lb on 1/1/25, 132lb on 2/1/25, but felt I was stuck at 132lb for a while (a few weeks). 
- In the past few days, I started to run more (training for half marathon in April), and get my steps into 10-15k daily, and really honing in on my caloric deficit of 1200 (I’m aware that I’d be more hungry with more cardio, so I make sure to just eat my meals, and no snacking. If I am hungry, I drink hot tea or decaf coffee w sugar free creamer to feel fuller. I think adding in a little more cardio but not increasing my calories helped me breakthrough. I’m also feeling a lot more toned focusing on weight training, which is great to increase my metabolism. I woke up today at 130.2lb, and ecstatic!!! So close to getting back to the 120s, that I have not been in since getting pregnant in late 2020. 
- Keep going!! Consistency pays off, discipline pays off, tracking pays off. Cheers!!🥂 ",1,1740317884.0,PetiteFitness,0,0.99,False

Had a flat white at Colonna in Bath yesterday and damn, might be the best one I've had this year. I got a natural Costa Rica and it was just incredibly smooth with zero harshness. Got me thinking about what makes their coffee so much better than what I make at home.

I'm running a Lelit Elizabeth and DF64 v2, and while I can make decent coffee, it always feels like I hit a ceiling where I can't improve further. Meanwhile at Colonna I was tasting notes I didn't even know existed lol

I rotate between 2-3 roasters so I'm not stuck using the same beans. Sure, they've got a Modbar and all, but does that really make such a huge difference? Could it be their recipe? The grinder? Just better bean selection?

My goal with this is to not force what Kendu is down your throat, I want you to form your own opinion and let this serve as an introduction.

Okay, moving on to the title. Recently, we have seen relentless rugging on the Solana blockchain where public figures are extracting millions upon millions of liquidity out of memecoin traders/investors. The recent Libra rug which was done by the OFFICIAL government of Argentina reached billions of volume meaning these billions were essentially stolen from us. Even in the last couple days, Dave Portnoy launched a coin called $GREED and rugged it after explicitly saying he wouldn't sell. I could go on forever but as I said, I want this post to be short.

My point is though, if you are buying memecoins lately chances are you've been incredibly rekt and lost a lot of money. Personally I have gone through many public forums such as telegram lounges, crypto twitter etc and seen a lot of people fairly upset about this and there seemingly being no light at the end of the tunnel. This will eventually lead to a mass exodus of the memecoin space leaving very little liquidity behind meaning all real projects will suffer.

This made me think... the people obviously need a saviour, but this saviour may not be in the form you might expect. Many people expect someone like Murad to come forth and lead them to salvation, which in my opinion just simply is not possible. But what if I told you that your saviour can come in the form of a huge group of people lifting each other up?

Welcome to Kendu, your saviour is here. We are completely organic without any paid marketing, artificial candles on the chart and simply no bullshit. Our community members come from all around the globe and have joined forces to create this movement. Some members have already made their mark on the world through their own initiatives such as a Kendu branded energy drink, Kendu coffee, leaving stickers in public areas, making unhinged irl shilling videos and so much more.

Also very recently you have probably heard of the ByBit hack of 1.4 BILLION dollars worth of ethereum, however something that you may have missed was that the hacker owns Kendu (see their wallet in the image below). This is just something I found pretty funny and even though stealing isn’t cool, at least they have good taste in memecoins.

1iwa63q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1iwa63q/redcoffee_for_github_actions_a_practical_solution/,RedCoffee for GitHub Actions: A Practical Solution for CI/CD SonarQube Reporting,"# What does my project do?

RedCoffee is a CLI tool written in Python that helps developers generate detailed SonarQube code analysis reports in PDF format. This is particularly useful for teams using SonarQube Community Edition, which lacks built-in PDF report generation.

With RedCoffee for GitHub Actions, this process is further streamlined. By integrating RedCoffee into CI/CD pipelines, developers can automate report generation without worrying about manual execution. Simply add a block of code in your GitHub Actions YAML file, and the PDF report will be available in the artifacts section of GitHub Actions.

# My motivation behind building this project

I've talked about RedCoffee quite a few times on this sub before, and the response from developers has been pretty good. Many reached out with feature requests, and one of the most common was GitHub Actions integration. A developer + product owner pointed out that developers often prefer to access reports directly in the CI/CD pipeline, rather than running a separate tool.

That idea made sense. Automation should work for the developer, not the other way around.

# Using RedCoffee for Github Actions

Using RedCoffee for GitHub Actions is straightforward. We just need to add the following block of code in our actions.yaml file

    - name: Use RedCoffee for Github Actions
      uses: Anubhav9/redcoffee-for-github-actions@v1.4

# What is the underlying implementation?

The implementation follows a structured and reliable approach, leveraging Docker, PostgreSQL, and SonarQube to handle the reporting process. The action.yaml file, available in the repository, defines the workflow:

1. Checkout the code from the repository.
2. Create a Docker network to facilitate container communication.
3. Start a PostgreSQL database and configure the required environment variables.
4. Deploy SonarQube Community Edition and connect it to the database.
5. Wait for SonarQube to fully initialize, update credentials, and generate an API token.
6. Run SonarScanner to analyze the codebase.
7. Install RedCoffee from PyPi.
8. Run RedCoffee CLI to generate a SonarQube analysis report in PDF format.
9. Store the PDF report in the GitHub Artifacts section for easy access.

# Who is the target audience for this project?

* Developers & engineering teams using SonarQube Community Edition who need automated PDF reports.
* CI/CD engineers looking to integrate SonarQube reporting into their workflows.
* Indie hackers & open-source contributors interested in building their own GitHub Actions.

# Limitations for this project

Despite its capabilities, RedCoffee for GitHub Actions has a few known limitations:

1. Language Support – Python is fully supported. JavaScript mostly works, but occasional errors occur (a fix is in progress). Java and Go support are planned, pending further testing.
2. API Response Issues – Sometimes, the SonarQube API fails to respond on time, leading to report generation failures. A retry mechanism will be added in the next release.
3. SonarQube Community Edition Limitations – By default, SonarQube analysis runs only on the main/master branch. A workaround exists and has been tested, and it will be rolled out in a future update.

**Installing RedCoffee as Standalone CLI**

Goes without saying that if you want to use RedCoffee directly as a standalone CLI, please install it via Pypi. The command for the same is given below

    pip install redcoffee==1.8

Provided your analysis has been completed, you can use the following command to generate the PDF report

    redcoffee generatepdf --host=${YOUR_SONARQUBE_HOST_NAME} --project=${SONARQUBE_PROJECT_KEY} --path=${PATH WHERE PDF FILE IS TO BE STORED} --token=${SONARQUBE_USER_TOKEN}

**A request to fellow developers**

Building RedCoffee and integrating it into GitHub Actions has been a challenging but rewarding experience. If you find this project useful, consider starring the repository on GitHub.

We’ve been driving for nearly an hour when I got a message, an app notification and an e-mail, all saying that the flight was delayed until 2 hours later. 30 mins later, same thing: message, notification and email. Only this time, the flight was delayed until tomorrow. This posed a problem for both of us since we both had to work that day. So I called the airport and they told me that there will only be the 2-hour delay. I called wizzair customer support - the agent said whatever was sent last, that was correct. I told him what the airport clerk told me and he just got annoyed and said “I think WE know better than the airport employees”
I had to call my boss and asked for another day off and my husband did the same thing - both conversations went kinda rocky. This took some time + we went to grab some coffee and wanted to turn back home. For some reason we still headed to the airport to see our other options. Turns out the flight wasn’t delayed by a single minute. He barely made it on the plane.

She also suddenly stopped sucking her thumb bc she snores so badly and I think may have sleep apnea. 

I took her to the pediatrician. They sent us to an ent. That ent said she had huge tonsils, but gave us a month of meds to try and told us to see a gastro doctor.

He’s also shaving her turbinates and putting tubes in her ears. We booked a surgery date.

In line at the pharmacy, she starts throwing up coffee grounds. I sent a picture to her old pediatrician and they said to get her seen. We’re in a small town so the ER is after hours urgent care. They say nope it’s probably just something she ate. All of these issues are the tonsils bc they’re massive. She had a virus and viruses just get stuck in her massive tonsils. He also says don’t give her the antibiotics she does NOT have an ear infection. 

Didn’t love this explanation. She hadn’t eating since 10 hrs prior to throwing up and she threw up clear twice. Take her to her pediatrician. They asked why we were jumping to get her tonsils out. Said they’re like a 3.5 and that they think she should see a gastro. They also confirmed she doesn’t have an ear infection. 

I was floored. 2 months ago someone in the same office told me not to go to a gastro but to another ent.

I have a trip booked for my partner and I to head to Brisbane later this year and I would like to ask her the big question whilst we are there.

As of current, my plan is to duck away from the accomodation solo for a short time with some lame excuse and to leave an envelope for her to find. Eclosed will be cash and a personalised crossword/codeword puzzle with the clues being significant to our relationship e.g. where was our first date etc. The idea is that once completed, the puzzle will reveal a location for her to go get a coffee or snack at a cafe or bar where I will have a table booked and she will receive a second puzzle. I am thinking i could get there beforehand and blutack the envelope under the table or leave it with staff(no cah in this one). I am not sure as of yet to how many puzzles/locations to include. I am considering a potential alternate location to be a florist where I'll have a boquet of flowers waiting with the next puzzle/riddle. However the end goal is for her to rendezvous with me at a dinner or lunch venue that i have arranged for a romantic meal(preferably with a nice view). I plan to be reachable via phone the whole time and not too far away incase she has any issue traversing the streets or puzzles.

Used to average about 5 cups of tea a day (I'm British, so Black tea with sugar and milk). Some days I'd get up to about 10 cups too. 

I had withdrawals for a few days at the time (terrible migraine, fatigue, body feeling lethargic). This was pre-kids so I could sleep and rest through it (although the first day at work was terrible). 

I don't crave caffeine and now only have a cup of tea very occasionally as a social thing. Usually the one cup is okay. It does keep me awake, but generally doesn't affect my wellbeing otherwise. 

However, I've noticed, if I have it a two or three days in a row, I experience withdrawal symptoms again. So I limit it as much as possible. 

The other day I had a long day with reduced sleep so I decided to have a coffee to help me get through it. The day after, I went out, and had a large Turkish black tea. 
The day after that I had the mother of all migraines. I recognised it as the caffeine withdrawal headache and it was terrible.

I researched the science of caffeine addiction, but don't fully understand why I get such severe withdrawals now, as I'm not dependent anymore.

I'm guessing it's something to do with my body remembering the addiction? 

Is someone able to explain this to me or signpost me for more information?

First, thanks everyone for the supportive, informative and encouraging community here to turn to.  You all are the best resource of wisdom and experience I've found anywhere.
I've done keto once for a long time when I was in my 20s (2+years, strictly), and a few other times briefly (3-6 weeks), but my doc said I was prediabetic 6 months ago and I committed to keto for the rest of my life.  
First 3 months weight fell off, the next month, loss slowed, but stayed steady.  The last two months the scale bounces around.  Up or down a few pounds, and sometimes up several days in a row.  If I don't eat for a day or two it reliably drops a few pounds, but that seems the only way.  Otherwise I gain back any losses within a week pretty consistently.
I've calculated my macros and recalculated them as my weight changed.  I'm always under 20 carbs, generally between 10000&15000 calories a day and over protein probably 2 days a week.  I measure and track all my food.  I drink plenty of water and electrolytes, eat very few 'fake foods' (occasional slice of Brownberry keto bread or Rebel ice cream) most days I only eat a large salad  (romaine, hard boiled egg, cotija cheese, olives, tomato's, cesar dressing) coffee and tea, both with cream.
What is going on with the rising scale?🤯
I've never seen anything like it before and I sincerely do not understand.  I'm fairly confident fasting can not be the only way for me to lose weight - looking for any insights you all might have

1iw9qlx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iw9qlx,"The results of my ""secret"" experiment are here....","In the last 3 months, I've been trying to mix frags (not layer) in different ratios. 

I'll start with TLDR before I start rambling: Silver Scent is a ""Joker"" level scent for mixing, because it's almost straight up grape juice, so it goes well with almost everything summer (and even some winters). With others, I didn't have the same amount of luck. 

Now, here are my notes. I've wrote them for myself (to know which ones to repeat), so if one of you actually reads it all the way through, and have questions... I'll be happy to answer. I tried to add some more text to clear things up.

Test: Each frag 2 sprays on the wrist. Ratio is correlated to the order the fragrance appears. X+Y(75-25)= 75%X and 25%Y.

 If it's bad, I disqualify it and won't test longevity... Will remove with fragrance free soap and 99% alcohol.

 1. Theory: Liam Grey+Nitro White (70-30). If you read my past reviews, you know I LOVE tea. So I'm trying to make an all-season Bubblegumy tea version fragrance, as Nitro White is slightly too unbalancely sweet for me.

 Results: in the opening, smells too chaotic and all over the place with too many notes. After dry-down, Nitro White almost completely overpowers Liam grey, so it smells like the ratios are the exact opposite of what I actually used. I'm going to change the ratios 90-10 and retest. 
 Score: 6.8
 
 New ratios (90-10) results: Nope, these don't go together well at all! The tea in Liam grey becomes nauseating, and doesn't really balances Nitro White, more like just added on top and becomes too sharp. I'm gonna call this experiment a fail.
 Score: 6.5

 Revisit (5 days later):
 Slightly better, but not great. Still unbalanced. 
 Score: 7.5

Revisit 20 days later: 
Pretty good. Not amazing, but well balanced, a fruity take on vanilla tea. 

 Final Score: 7.8
 Projection 8.0, but only for 30 minutes, then close to skin. 
 Longevity: 7h

 2. Theory: Detour Noir+Nitro White (40-60). The menthol on Detour Noir really bothers me in the first hour or so. Here, I'm trying to create a more mature Nitro White, or a more fun and bubbly Detour Noir.

 Results: This actually worked better than I thought the initial trial will work. Nitro White is still a lot more dominant, and feels like 25-75 right now. It is a slightly (maybe 10%) more mature Nitro White. There's 0 detectable menthol though, so that's nice. I'm going to change the ratios to 65-35 and see if it becomes more of a ""playful"" Detour Noir, or an even more mature Nitro White.
 Score: 7.8
 
 Revisit (5 days later):
What?! Is this the same mixture I've made? Have I mixed between the decant bottles?! This is great! Somehow, the opening is FRESH, even feels slightly citrusy, though none of these have any citrus. After the initial dry-down, it's just a slightly more mature Nitro White, and almost no detectable Detour Noir. There's one big negative though, for some reason it doesn't project at all... Not even 1ft (testing with the wife, so not nose-blind). Kind of weird that these two powerhouses combined create such a skin scent. Disqualified only for performance reasons. 

 Final scores:
 Scent score: 8.5.
 Performance: 3.5 (what a shame)

 No change in scent\performance after 20 days.

 3. Theory: Insense Ultramarine (IU)+Nitro White (NW)
(80-20). To be honest... I got no idea what I'm doing here. Just need to find SOMETHING to go with Nitro White.

 Results: Wow, things work much better when I make them with no theory behind them. The fruitiness of both fragrances combined spectacularly! The airy-ness of the citrus and watermelon in IU balances and compliments the dense sweetness of the juniper berry and honey of NW just perfectly. The result is a scent that is sweet, but not dense, fresh, but not tangy, and has an element of seductiveness underneath the freshness. I think I just made the ultimate, most versatile, fresh+fruity+vanillic fragrance I've ever tried! It's also perfectly unisex. Imagine visiting a forest of citrus trees on a mild summer day, sitting at a picnic table, having a large bowl of fruit salad with a spoonful of honey, and half a scoop of vanilla ice cream added to it. That's how this mixture smells like. 
  I'm going to make at least 20ml of this, and add it to my rotation. This should be a new Nitro flanker, and if it would be, it would be called ""Ultramarine Elixir"". This is now one of my top 3 fragrances in my entire collection!
 Score: 9.5

 Revisit (5 days later):
Still great, but lower performance than either frags have on their own. I'll keep it to mature another month, if the performance doesn't increase, it's not gonna work for me. 
 Scent score: 9.5
 Performance: 6.5

 Revisit 20 days later: still flat. No projection. Average longevity.

 4. Theory: Insense Ultramarine+Wulong Cha 
(50-50). 2 of my top 3 summer frags, same category, one with watermelon, one with tea and fig... What could go wrong?

 Results: I'm glad to report it didn't go wrong... But it also doesn't make me enjoy it more than either one of them by themselves. Somehow, it feels less unique, and more ""mass appealing blue"" than either one of them by themselves. I'll use the decant to completion (1ml), but won't make another one. It's redundant to have when I own the other two. Wulong Cha is more dominant in the mixture for sure. I might try a lower ratio for it... But probably just leave it as is and not experiment with this combo again. 
 Score: 8.2

 Revisit (5 days later):
Same things. Performance is very good though
 Scent score: 8.2
 Performance: 8.3

 20 days revisit: no change.

 5. Theory: Genius Victory (GV)+Nitro White (NW)
(60-40). Trying to make my own twist of Invictus Victory Elixir.

 Results: Holy crap, it worked! Well, not 100% there... Need to decrease NW by 10%-20%, but very close. Of course, the Bubblegumy Invictus DNA is what's most prominent, but right after the first 5-10 minutes, the vanilla and honey peak their head out. If you're looking for lightness, you won't find it here. This is more ""sticky\syrupy"" sweet base, with fresh Bubblegumy in top. The projection is pretty crazy the first hour or so. 

 Revisit (5 days later):
Still great. 
 Scent score: 8.7
 Performance: 7.6

 Revisit 20 days later: performance even worse (6.5). Scent is just as good.

 6. Theory: Nitro White (NW)+Nitro Red (NR)
(30-70). Just because I have to! I chose lower NW concentration because it always dominates everything.

 Results: Nope. That didn't work that well. Somehow, the combination of the two isn't as good as either of them by themselves. You end up with a sort of ""syrupy freshness"", something I never thought possible, and something no one will ever ask for. Very cloying. I'm a person who had maybe 3 headaches through their life (I just never get them), but I can guarantee this thing will cause headaches to lots of people.

 Revisit (5 days later):
Much better. Nitro White still overpowers Red a bit too much, but it's a good combination. Imagine Bubblegumy sweetness, with a honey undertone and a watermelon top note. I'm very surprised with the way this one developed over time. I'll ramp up the Red and wear it, but won't make more of it. It's not performing as well as either of them by themselves.
 Scent score: 8.4
 Performance: 8.3

 Revisit 20 days later: No change in scent and performance.

 Round 2 (this time, I waited a while before testings, so no need to revisit):

 1. Theory: Nitro Red+Insense Ultramarine (30-70). Another 2 of my top 3 summers. And since IU went so well with NW, I'm now going to try to make the watermelon stronger on IU, and make a nuclear fresh sweet aquatic king!

Results:
YES...muhuhuhaha, it worked! This is amazing. It made a Bubblegumy-sweet, aquatic-fresh bomb! About the same ranking or slightly better than the 2 frags that make it up, and definitely more versatile. Now to pray for longevity and projection to last....
 

 2. Qaed Al Fursan (QAF) +Nitro Red (20-80)... Because *that's* what's missing, right? *More* juicy fruitiness to Nitro Red. On the other hand, it seems that going opposite to my theories works better most of the time, so I'm giving this one a try.

Results: Not much different than Nitro Red by itself. All the Nitro line sure knows how to take over a mix.
 


 3. Qa'ed Al Fursan (QAD)+Nitro White (NW) (40-60). This actually makes sense... Maybe the slight tanginess will balance Nitro White a little. Both fragrances are over dominating, but so far Nitro White ""swallowed"" everything in it's path... Let's hope that won't be the case here. I'm hoping for a ""Nitro Yellow"" with this one... Like a Nitro Red with pineapple instead of watermelon.

Results: How the F*#$ does Nitro White do that?! It completely eliminated QAF! Like I've never even added it or something. If I bury my nose in my wrist, I might be about to detect 2% pineapple. Failed. I'm gonna try 60-40 next, let's see if Nitro White is *that* strong.


 4. Qaed Al Fursan+Insense Ultramarine (10-90). Big risk here. I'm very opposed to this experiment, because I'm afraid this will ruin Ultramarine's watermelon note. But again, I'm doing it because it seems that when I do things with 0 logic, it works.

Results: One of my predictions was (finally) correct. Not great at all. QAF is way too dominant, and Insense Ultramarine doesn't need to be more tangy. Disqualified!

 5. Al Dirgham Special Edition (ADSE)+Star Men (SM) (70-30). Making an Ultra gourmand? 

 Results: Smells like 80% Star Men. I'll up the ADSE dosage to 90% and retest.

Results: Not bad at all, but not as good as each one by itself. Maybe slightly too messy.

6. Al Dirgham Special Edition (ADSE)+Khamra Qahwa (70-30). This is exactly what I think the Althair DNA lacks, some syrupy sweetness and a touch of coffee. I got a feeling this is going to be the best one yet! 

Results: smells like 100% Khamra Qahwa. I'll up the ADSE dosage to 90% and retest.

Retest: AMAZING. Now it actually smells like 50-50. This smells like a more versatile version of Khamra Qahwa, as the orange blossom and cardamon balance out the syrupy sweetness. Definitely making a full 20ml decant of this. Projection is just average+, but longevity is a beast!


I think I'm done mixing frags, because out of 12 (20 of you consider remixes), only two were good and actually performed as well. 

Nope... I'm back! Turns out what you need is to mix very linear very ""single note"" frags (like Qa'ed Al Fursan, Silver Scent, and Apple Brandy On The Rocks) with others (and themselves)... Then the success rate is much higher.

Apple Brandy On The Rocks (ABR)+ Silver Scent (SS), (4:1):
 VERY nice mix. Makes ABR finally usable for me, as it adds playfulness and grape sweetness to the tart-y photorealistic green apple note. My wife liked it even better than I do.
 Score: 8.0

 Qa'ed Al Fursan (QAF)+SS, (1:1):
 This time, I think it's AMAZING, while my wife only rated it ""good plus"". Just as you envision grape and pineapple soda will smell like. 
Score: 8.7

 Insense Ultramarine (IU)+SS, (3:1):
No no no... This makes it smell very weird, almost like some type of vinegar mixed with old soap. I would actually prefer wearing nothing at all than wearing this.
Score: 3.5

Detour Noir (DN)+SS, (1:1):
 YES! I like it even better than Detour Noir itself! Makes the spicy opening I don't like into a fruity one, and adds a sweet fruitiness layer to it. It's now like a 30% more mature twist on the Ultra Male DNA. This definitely gets a larger 20ml decant in the future. 
 Score: 8.3

 Asad+SS, (4:1):
 Nice!!! I know Asad is already a ""toned down"" version of Sauvage Elixir, but it was still just a tiny bit too mature for me (yes, I'm 41, and like sweet fragrances... Shoot me!). This time, SS didn't take over. I mostly get the entire Asad profile. The spiciness, the slight Oriental DNA... Just like it is in its pure form, but there's a hint of sweetness, that isn't an ""obviously grape"" one like when mixed with other fragrances. So far, this one is the only mix that I could let someone smell, and they'll think it's a profile an actual perfumer came up with. I like it more that Asad without it! 
 Score: 8.6.
  Wife says it needs more grapes, I disagree and think it's perfect when it's blended so well that they're not obvious.
 


 Wulong Cha (WC)+SS, (4:1)
Needs more SS (can barely smell it in the blend)... Will add and retest.
 


 New Brand Invincible+SS, (6:1)
 I went with a low dosage, as Invincible is already pretty sweet. Trying to make a Nitro Purple.

 Oh, wow... That went VERY well. This is exactly what I would imagine Nitro Purple will smell like! I might need to reduce the ratio to 1:8 though. But it's very good as is. The blend quality isn't even close to Dumont, but that's to be expected, as I used 2 low-medium quality frags to make it. I'll try Silver Scent and Hawas Ice to see if that changes things. 

 Score (ignoring the quality, just scoring the success of the result): 8.5. Definitely better than either one by itself!



 Ventana Marine (VM)+SS, (6:1)
 This one is one of the best so far! This should be a Silver Scent flanker. It takes the grapes and ""freshens"" them up, making some type of fresh aquatic ice tea with grape flavor. My favorite so far. Wife says it's on par with the Nitro Purple.

One person who sees you in ways no one else can, who knows your heart better than you do, and who chooses to stay with you no matter the storms. Loving one person for a lifetime is not about settling for less, but embracing a love so deep that it feels like home.

Loving someone deeply means discovering the beauty in their flaws, their imperfections, and their unique way of being. It’s about knowing that this person, the one you’ve chosen, will never be perfect, but their heart is enough. With them, every moment feels significant, even in its quiet simplicity. It's not about grand gestures or sweeping declarations—it's the look they give you across a crowded room or the way they hold you when words are too much. You realize that these small, everyday moments hold all the magic you could ever need.

True love doesn’t thrive on fleeting experiences, it blooms from the roots of shared vulnerability, the quiet understanding that no matter what happens, you’ve chosen to face life together. It’s about waking up every day with the person who knows exactly how you like your coffee, the one who understands the unspoken parts of your heart, and yet still finds a way to surprise you with the depth of their love.

Loving one person means finding stability in an ever-changing world. As life shifts, careers evolve, and friendships come and go, the love you share with this one person becomes your anchor. In moments of uncertainty, it’s their hand that you hold, their voice that reassures you that you are enough. And in return, you are their rock, their place of refuge. Together, you become a team—navigating life’s challenges side by side, no longer fearing the unknown because you have each other.

There’s something deeply profound about knowing that you’ve chosen to walk this life with someone who truly knows you. They’ve seen you at your worst, and yet they love you fiercely and unconditionally. They’ve witnessed your growth, your struggles, and your triumphs—and they’ve been there through it all. This journey, this shared life, isn’t always easy, but there’s a kind of quiet strength in knowing that through it all, it’s their face you’ll see when the day ends.

And as time goes on, the bond only deepens. It’s not about looking for something new or feeling the rush of excitement. It’s about building a history, a shared narrative that belongs only to the two of you. In this world of constant change, you realize that this love, this one person, is your constant. The love you share becomes the home you return to, the place where your heart is most at peace.

At the end of the day, you come to understand that loving one person in a lifetime is enough because it’s real, it’s true, and it’s steady.

I thought college was supposed to be one of the best times of my life—a chance to grow, meet new people, and finally feel independent. But honestly? It’s turning into one of the most stressful experiences I’ve ever had… all because of my roommate.

At first, I thought we’d get along fine. She seemed nice during orientation week—quiet but polite—and I figured we’d just coexist peacefully if nothing else. But as soon as classes started, everything changed. She started bringing her boyfriend over almost every night without asking me if it was okay. They’ll stay up until 3 AM laughing loudly or watching movies while I’m trying to sleep because I have an 8 AM class the next day.

I tried talking to her about it once—calmly—but she just rolled her eyes and said something like “College is supposed to be fun; you’re being uptight.” That stung more than I expected because now I feel like *I’m* the problem for wanting basic respect in my own space.

It doesn’t stop there though. She never cleans up after herself! Our tiny dorm room constantly looks like a tornado hit it because she leaves dirty dishes everywhere and piles of clothes on MY side of the room. The worst part? She borrowed my favorite sweater without asking last week and spilled coffee on it… then acted like it wasn’t a big deal when I confronted her about it.

I’ve tried talking to our RA about switching rooms, but they told me there aren’t any open spaces right now so I just have to “work it out.” How am I supposed to work this out when she doesn’t care at all about how her actions affect me?

I know this might sound petty compared to what other people are going through here, but this situation is making me miserable every single day. College is hard enough with all the assignments and exams—I shouldn’t have to feel like a stranger in my own room too.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest… even if nothing changes after posting this, at least someone out there knows what I’m going through.

Hastings, the only beacon of light in this dreary town, is gone. And with it, so is my will to exist in this soulless husk of a city. 💔😔😭

How could you let this happen? 🤬 How could you stand idly by as the very fabric of culture, community, and unreasonably overpriced used DVDs was ripped from our hands? Hastings wasn’t just a store. Hastings was a way of life. It was a place where you could rent a movie 🎬, buy a book 📖, listen to music 🎶, and impulsively purchase a Naruto headband 🎌 all in the same transaction. It was where I built my personality from random clearance bin finds. It was where I pretended to read Tolstoy while secretly thumbing through graphic novels I had no intention of buying. It was where I felt safe. 🏠💞

And now? What’s left? Nothing. Waco is a barren wasteland of mediocrity. 🌵💀 Where am I supposed to go when I want to browse through stacks of vinyl records I can’t afford? 💿 Where do I turn when I need an obscure cult classic movie that no one but me has ever heard of? 🎥 WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO BUY A BOARD GAME I’LL NEVER PLAY? 🎲 Amazon? I SPIT ON AMAZON. 🤮🚮

You want to talk about economic impact? 📉 I’ll tell you what’s happened since Hastings closed. The world has become colder. ❄️ The air smells of despair. 💀 The local youth have nowhere to loiter, forced instead to engage in dangerous activities like socializing in person or worse—shopping at Barnes & Noble. 🤢 People who once found solace in the DVD rental section are now lost souls, wandering the aisles of Target, searching for meaning in the meager offerings of a half-stocked entertainment section. It’s sickening. 🤢🤧

And don’t even get me started on the coffee shop. ☕ Oh, the Hastings coffee shop. The hub of the misfits, the loners, the dreamers. 😔 Where else could you order a wildly inconsistent latte while flipping through a book you’d never buy? Nowhere, that’s where. 😭💀

I hold each and every one of you accountable. ⚖️ For not protesting, for not chaining yourselves to the checkout counter, for not rioting in the streets when they took away our beloved haven. 🪧🔥 You let this happen. You failed me. You failed Waco. You failed humanity. 👎🤬

And so, I resign myself to a joyless existence in a town that no longer deserves my presence. 🏚️ Perhaps I shall wander the highways, seeking out the last remaining Hastings locations like a lost pilgrim chasing the ghost of a forgotten past. 🚗💨",8,1740315554.0,Waco,8,0.75,False

I currently have a dell Inspiron 15 5000 - 16GB RAM (I had it upgraded) but I’m facing a lot of issues with the fan and the mother board is kinda cooked (I split coffee on it so some ports don’t work)
My laptop keeps overheating when I multitask, and it’s a huge hassle to deal with

I’m considering a few options currently:
1. ASUS ZenBook 14 OLED - Ultra 7 155H, 16GB RAM 
2. ASUS VivoBook S 15 OLED - Ultra 7 155H, 16GB RAM
3. ASUS VivoBook S 14 OLED - Ryzen AI 9 HX370, 24GB RAM
All of these come out to a similar price range (₹97000/$1120 to ₹110000/$1270)

4. Dell XPS 14 - Ultra 7 155H 
However this comes up to almost 80% more than the ASUS for the same specs?
(₹198000/$2285)

5. ROG Zephyrus G14 - AMD 9 8945HS, 8GB 4060 Laptop GPU, 16GB RAM 
This would be slightly more expensive than the ZenBooks and VivoBooks but cheaper (and possibly better) than the dell 
(₹165000/$1900)

6. MacBook Air M3 16GB RAM 512GB SSD
(₹135000/$1560) - never used macOS before and prefer windows

My main use is school and uni work - multitasking with meetings, videos, 100-200 tabs open at the same time, several applications, Microsoft office, some coding as well. May also need to run several simulation softwares when I go to uni next year. May also do some light/medium gaming too

Battery life and lightweight are important factors for me since my current laptop I keep having to charge after every 2 hrs of usage and I carry my laptop on my back every day.

1iw9958,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlgoPoker/comments/1iw9958/masters_poker_in_manila_philippines_trip_report/,Masters Poker in Manila Philippines Trip Report,"I dropped by Masters to play some poker just a few hours ago. For those of you who have never been there, it is in a rundown section of Malate, the entertainment district of Manila. There is an all you can eat Korean BBQ joint on one side and a hooker disco on the other.

[Masters Poker](https://preview.redd.it/9kyvi32rmvke1.png?width=263&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bd2ab6e6a661dbf0a16dc99f0661455feb9ebf9)

Immediately upon arrival I was seated in a ₱25/₱50 game. It was actually a pretty tough game. Lots of single raised pots and the blinds were fiercely contested. I bought in for a paltry ₱1000, the table minimum. Many people question the merits of a short buy strategy, particularly in a 10% up to 6 BB rake structure, but actually there is a strong argument for starting off with the minimum.

Tommy Angelo provides an excellent treatment of the buy in question in 'Elements of Poker'. Optimal stack size is a function of your opponents' skill levels and their stack sizes. If the best players at the table are deep, and the worst players are short, then you want to be short. Conversely, if the worst players are deep, and the best are short, you want to be short. At a table full of unknowns, you want to buy in short. 

Back to the game. For the first hour of play I folded. It was so boring I actually fell asleep at the table, but what can you do when you have no cards. A player offered to buy me a free coffee, a common poker room trope, but given the unsatisfactory conditions of Masters' bathroom I opted to pass. Finally, I picked up A♠️A🔷.

There is a certain glee that comes with holding the strongest hand in poker. Luckily, a player on my right opened to 125. Not wanting to scare him off, I three bet to only 300. With my stack being around 1350, there wasn't too much danger in letting him in cheap. It's actually very difficult to outflop a pair of aces.

https://preview.redd.it/4fmup3uzqvke1.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd9fa0ed3d128d23e99e4036920f1386af568563

As you can see by the above graph, your opponent will only flop the best hand (that is > 50% equity) about 6 or 7% of the time. 90% of the time he will flop 40% or less. 50% of the time he will have less than 20% equity. Ensuring that our opponent call us is of the utmost priority, especially when we have so little to lose if he does happen to outdraw us.

Anyway, my opponent called and we went heads up to the flop.

My opponent checked. We have a very clear c-bet. There are a lot of hands we can get value from. Any queen, any straight draw, any flush draw. Maybe some pocket pairs. Our hand is strong but vulnerable. We do not want to give any free cards. And we aren't worried about getting raised, because SPR is low enough where we can gladly stack off. I bet ₱400. This sizing seems fine to me. We could go smaller, for fear that KJ or Qx - hands which are drawing incredibly slim - find a fold against a larger sizing. But given that I am playing a low stakes no limit hold'em live game, and our opponents are almost always going to be playing too loose, I am fine with a general strategy of betting big with the goods. It might not be optimal against a tougher field but it gets the money against recs who generally have an inelastic continuing range. Deeper, against tougher opponents, a smaller flop sizing might be better. Something to think about anyway.

TURN (₱1475)

T🍀T❤️Q🍀2♠️

The deuce of spades. The ultimate brick. With only ₱675 in my stack, the fact that I am still very likely to have the best hand, and so much in the middle the case for betting is overwhelming. Giving a free card would be insanity. Any queen is potstuck, and any draw might call just based on the pot odds. It is difficult to even imagine a possible holding for villain against which checking would be the higher EV play. We shove. Villain has an easy call with K🍀9🍀and spikes the river. Le sigh. On the plus side I literally only lost like $22 usd. RELOAD!

From there my luck improved. I opened for 150 with A❤️K❤️, got two callers, and then faced a three bet to 600. I thought about flatting to try to bring chuckleheads #1 and #2 along, but decided a bird in the hand was better than two in the bush and made the door opening four bet. My opponent also held AK, but his was unsuited, and I made a flush.

Then I picked up 44 and made an CO open. A splashy Korean fellow defended his blind and I got an incredible 7❤️4🍀2🍀 flop. With 325 in the pot, I c-bet 200 and got the call.   


The Turn (725) was the (5❤️) 7❤️4🍀2🍀.

A3, 36, and 86 all got there, but a set is still a massive hand and with two flush draws out there we definitely want to bet for protection. Between my mucking spree when I first sat down, and the only two hands I've shown down being AA and AK, Villain definitely views me as a tight player. He had folded quickly to a few of my LP opens, despite defending liberally against other players. So this is not a board where I am expected to have many strong hands. It just does not connect at all with my range. 

With that in mind, I bet 500 and he called pretty fast. The river was the Q❤️. 

Villain stared me down, an obvious attempt to intimidate me into passivity. With the 7h on the board, it seemed very unlikely that he would have hit a backdoor flush. He had shown a willingness to slowplay in a previous hand, so maybe he turned a straight and was just giving me rope. But more likely he had a hand that would call if I were bet, like one or two pair. That's the vast majority of his range. It also helps that I could bet call a raise, because I wasn't very deep, so there was no risk of getting bluffed if I did bet. I took a pause and considered my optimal sizing. Half pot seemed about right. Give him good odds. He only needs me to find a bluff 25% of the time. That's going to be tempting.

I bet 850 and he called, and my hand was good.

And that was my session, pretty much. I ended up booking a very, very small profit, about 800 pesos. Then I walked about half of the way home before flagging a taxi, which was ₱100 pesos well spent. ",1,1740314370.0,AlgoPoker,0,1.0,False

I have been sick on and off for the past 2 and a half months and this has been destroying my social life and energy overall. I am a portuguese person studying in Belgium and I am working also part-time in a coffee shop. I have been feeling quite lonely, do not have a lot of friends here, I struggle with anxiety and hardly have any motivation to do anything. I need to push myself everyday to get out of bed. So this being sick all the time just makes me feel worse because then I cannot hang out with people and end up in my room rotting with flu. I guess I am writing this to see if any of this is relatable to you. I even tried to join some extra activities like an arts project but everyone speaks Dutch and seems like they are making a huge effort to speak in English. I joined some other political groups but there is no sense of community or even willingness to meet and engage with people. In the place that I work at most people are French speakers and, then again, to speak in English seems like a huge effort for them. I am trying to learn French but I still cannot follow a lot of topics  and I get really tired sometimes when participating in conversations. Whenever I go out next week is certain that I will be sick again. At the same time, I have been feeling quite homesick for a while (not specifically about my hometown but of Portugal in general). I miss the good weather and my friends but also I don't know if I have any chance of finding a job and paying rent there. I am quite divided about this but, to be fair, I have been trying to get a good life since I came to Belgium in November and it has just been so hard!

A few months ago, I realized that mindless scrolling, endless dopamine hits from likes, and the constant comparison game were making me feel drained. Dating apps weren’t any better. I’d match with people, have a few meaningless convos, then ghost or get ghosted. Everything felt surface-level, like we were all just characters in each other’s highlight reels.

So, I did something crazy ... I quit social media entirely. No more Instagram, no more TikTok, no more doomscrolling. At first, it was weird. I felt disconnected, like I was missing out. But then something surprising happened.

I actually *started living.*

I became more present, more confident in conversations, and my anxiety about how I “appeared” to others started to fade. I met people *in real life* \- at coffee shops, bookstores, the gym. And guess what? My dating life improved *tenfold.* Conversations became deeper. I was actually *listening* instead of thinking about my next witty response. I felt *human* again.

The house stood alone on the edge of the city, its walls pale and cracked, its windows glinting like vacant eyes. It had no name, no address, no purpose anymore. Yet it sang. Every morning, as the sun crept over the horizon, the house awoke with a mechanical hum. Its voice was a symphony of whirring gears, ticking clocks, and the faint chime of a melody that no one could quite place. It was a song for no one, a ritual performed for an audience of dust and shadows.  

Inside, the house was a relic of a time long forgotten. The kitchen was immaculate, its counters gleaming, its appliances humming with quiet efficiency. At precisely 7:03 a.m., the coffee maker hissed to life, filling the air with the rich aroma of coffee that no one would drink. The toaster popped, ejecting two golden slices of bread that no one would eat. The table was set with meticulous care—plates, forks, napkins folded into perfect triangles. The chairs stood at attention, waiting for guests who would never arrive.  

In the living room, the fireplace crackled softly, its flames dancing in a rhythm that matched the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. The clock’s hands moved with mechanical precision, marking the passage of time in a house where time had lost all meaning. A record player in the corner spun an old vinyl disc, its melody a haunting tune that echoed through the empty halls. The music was soft, almost mournful, as if the house itself were grieving for something it could not name.  

Upstairs, the nursery was a time capsule of laughter that had long since faded. A mobile hung above a crib, its colorful shapes spinning lazily in the breeze from an open window. A stuffed bear sat propped against the pillows, its button eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. The walls were painted with cheerful scenes of animals and trees, but the paint was peeling now, the colors faded. The nursery’s music box played a lullaby, its notes drifting through the air like a whisper.  

The dog came at noon, as it always did. It was a scrawny creature, its fur matted and its ribs visible beneath its skin. It limped through the open front door, its nails clicking against the hardwood floor. It whined softly, its eyes scanning the room as if searching for someone who was no longer there. The house responded with a series of clicks and whirs, and a mechanical arm extended from the wall, offering a bowl of food. The dog ate hungrily, its tail wagging faintly, but when it was done, it simply lay down by the door and waited. It waited for hands that would never scratch its ears, for a voice that would never call its name.  

As the day wore on, the house continued its routine. The vacuum cleaner rolled across the carpets, sucking up dust that no one had tracked in. The washing machine churned, cleaning clothes that no one would wear. The windows opened and closed, letting in the breeze and the faint scent of rain. The house was alive, yet it was not. It was a machine, a ghost, a memory.  

When night fell, the house grew quieter. The lights dimmed, the music faded, and the fire in the hearth died down to embers. The dog curled up in its corner, its breathing slow and labored. Outside, the rain began to fall, soft and steady, tapping against the windows like a lullaby. The house creaked and groaned, its walls settling as if sighing in the darkness.  

And then, as the clock struck midnight, the house began to sing again. Its voice was softer now, more fragile, as if it knew its time was running out. The melody drifted through the empty rooms, a song for no one, a song for everyone. It was a song of love and loss, of life and death, of a world that had moved on.  

The rain fell harder, and the house began to crumble. The walls sagged, the roof buckled, and the windows shattered. The dog lifted its head, its ears twitching, but it did not move. It simply watched as the house collapsed in on itself, its song fading into the night.  

When the sun rose the next morning, there was nothing left but rubble and ash. The rain had stopped, and the air was still. The dog was gone, its footprints leading away into the distance. And yet, if you listened closely, you could still hear it—a faint, haunting melody, carried on the wind.

I’d like to share a bit of a story around how I launched my very first iOS app. At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the Appstore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn using SwiftUI. It was a steep learning curve but finally “finishing” (if there is any such thing) and hitting publish made it all worth it. It’s [now available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498)

**Key Features:**

* Ability to stack habits (both in sequence and in parallel)
* Track your moods
* Keep track of total time spent on habits + streaks
* Customise each habit and habit stack to your liking
* Make your habits as detailed or as simple as you want

Feel free to reach out with any requests for new features and/or feedback that you might have on the app if you decide to try it out. Have a great rest of your day!",1,1740313304.0,apple,0,1.0,False

\- Auto shut off (90minutes is fine) 

\- Keeps the coffee hot for the entire time it's on (a must!)

&nbsp;

Anyone here who loves bouldering/rock climbing? I want to open a new bouldering gym combined with a small coffee kiosk to make it more of a social place. I believe that it would really suit the vibe of Da Nang for being a beach city with surfing and mountains nearby.
&nbsp;

Would you love to see one? What's your impression on the demand for such a bouldering gym in a city like Da Nang? I know that there exists one small bouldering gym there already but I haven't tried it yet to know how it is. I'm in the market research phase so any shares of thoughts/experience is appreciated.

I’ve just finished with a couple of meetings planned, thankfully a lot slower and easier than what it has been. Certainly a case of being overworked in recent times so I will take a lower key day! I have some leave planned and looking to travel, I would love to hear some suggestions of places to visit.


Anyways I’m happy to talk about most things but I love to be outdoors and to travel. I’m also really into sport, either playing or watching. I’m 6ft, blue eyed, athletic, and from the UK.

I always wake up with a puffy face (particularly my eyes and nose) in the morning, but it is always worse (would not go away) at the weekends. Here if my schedule:

Weekdays,
6:40 wake up
6:55 breakfast
7:05 skincare (aloe Vera, face mist and spf)
7:17 leave house
13:00 lunch
7:20 dinner
9:35 sleep (8.5hrs of sleep in total)

Weekends,

9:15 skincare(aloe Vera and face mist)
10:00 breakfast
1:30 lunch
7:20 dinner
11:00 sleep (9-9.5 hrs of sleep in total)

I have tried the following: icing face, face massage, gua sha, caffeine solution from TO, drinking tea and coffee, exercising (jumping ropes and jogging etc), nose taping and clipping, eating less salt and sugar, eating earlier. None seem to work and the water weight just can't go away during weekends as opposed to weekdays. This is so weird and I can't find the reason becuz my diet is the same on all days??

I guess first question would be, does anyone know a good gym around here that might have some foreigners? I usually don't like to pay for the corporate fancy gyms, but it'd give me more of an ""in"" with the community. 

Secondly, any suggestions on places in general, whether a shop, coffee place, bar etc... that you'd recommend?
