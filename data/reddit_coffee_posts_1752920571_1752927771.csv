1m3uw0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m3uw0s/what_are_the_different_types_of_keurig_coffee/,What are the different types of Keurig coffee makers?,"As someone who's been using Keurig machines for over 5 years, I want to break down the different types of Keurig coffee makers to help you choose the right one for your needs.

I've tested multiple models, and I'll share my honest experience with each type. Let's dive into the main categories:

Classic Keurig Models
These are your standard single-serve coffee makers. The K-Classic and K-Select are perfect for basic coffee brewing. They're straightforward to use - just pop in a K-cup, choose your cup size, and press brew. If you're looking for a reliable machine that makes regular coffee without fancy features, check out the current deals on classic models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Plus Series
The Plus series, including the K-Supreme Plus and K-Elite, offers more brewing options. You get temperature control, strong brew settings, and even iced coffee features. I particularly love the K-Supreme Plus for its MultiStream technology, which extracts more flavor from each pod.

Office and Commercial Models
The K-150 and K-155 are built for office use. They have larger water reservoirs and can handle heavy daily use. These machines connect directly to water lines, so you don't need to refill them constantly.

Specialty Brewers
The K-Cafe and K-Latte models are my personal favorites for making specialty drinks. They come with milk frothers and can brew concentrated shots for lattes and cappuccinos. If you enjoy coffeehouse-style drinks, these are worth considering.

Smart Brewers
The K-Supreme Smart is Keurig's newest innovation. It connects to your phone and remembers your favorite settings. While it's pricier, the customization options are impressive.

Mini Models
The K-Mini and K-Mini Plus are perfect for small spaces. They're about 5 inches wide and ideal for dorm rooms or small kitchens. The trade-off is a smaller water reservoir.

You can compare all these models and find the best deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Important Features to Consider:
- Water reservoir size (from 48 oz to 96 oz)
- Cup size options (4-12 oz)
- Temperature control
- Strength control
- Maintenance alerts
- Auto-off feature
- Display type
- Compatible pod types

My top recommendation? The K-Supreme Plus. It hits the sweet spot between features and price, and the coffee quality is noticeably better than basic models.

Remember that all Keurig machines need regular cleaning and descaling. Also, while most models work with all K-cups, some newer ones only accept Keurig-branded pods.

I hope this helps you choose the right Keurig for your coffee needs. Let me know if you have any questions about specific models!",1,1752927640.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

My first thought is, ""What must I do to make sure my client/patient is okay?""

I WILL call you or send you a message. Don't worry, I'm NOT going to hide it from you. 

But bombarding me with phone calls and messages because I called someone to quickly help me get them up because I'm not strong enough on my own... no, man. 

I don't mind the extra helper reaching out and telling you. That was the person the patient felt most at ease with in that moment of confusion and distress. I'm not going to leave them on the floor alone while I call you to tattle. I'm on the floor or on the bed or whatever with them. I didn't wait 4 hours to call for help. I tried myself, saw I wasn't going to manage, and called someone 4 minutes away. 10 seconds later they had your family member up and on the bed!

Can I just get the patient/client on the bed and blanket over them? Maybe a cup of sweet tea or Coke or orange juice just to help calm their nerves? 

You're +6 hours away. What... you're not here to assess the situation. 

I don't have 50 hands. I don't have 30 ears. I don't have 10 mouths. I can't do everything at once.

Let me use my common sense, my logic, my skills and knowledge (I know you might not think it's a lot, but have a little faith?) to FIRST help grandma or grandpa or mom or dad up. 

Let me check that they didn't first hurt a head or neck or back. I know I must check for open wounds, I know I must check movement capabilities. Let me check they didn't hit their head and maybe have a concussion. I know not to just swoop in and push someone around. 
(Guuuuuurl, I saw how the close family friend just ripped the patient's arm out of the long shirt sleeve... maybe the arm injury is from that, not my gentle, slow assistance? Like??? When the patient is closer to 90 than 80, nooooo, don't play tug-of-war with their body parts!)

Do you realise how much of a shock it is so fall at such an old age? Their heads are everywhere. They feel scared, embarrassed, hurt, uncomfortable, disappointed, shocked. 

I know you're worried. Or I at least hope you are. I would be worried too. 

You weren't open and honest to me about them and their health. But I'm still going to do the best that I can, and do it safely. 

Let me just be there for them and assist them first, please?

If I don't know what to do, or if it's is serious or something I'm unsure about, I'll contact someone. I'll ask your hospital and doctor preferences. If I need an ambulance, I'll call for help. I know I'm not qualified for many things. I'm not going to do open heart or closed heart surgery. 

Just give me a minute. 

Chill. Chill pill. Have I ever hidden something like this from you? No. I send photos. I send updates. You get your 10 minute voicenotes with me giving a full day update of anything going wrong. 

I'm not going to worry you if I couldn't work out the microwave for two days (if I could warm things another way and eventually figure out what I was doing wrong). That's silly. Am I going to bother you because they messed some tea/coffee on their shirt and I insisted they change their shirt? Nah. Happens to all of us. But I'll keep you up to date with important things like your grandma's/mom's or grandpa's/dad's health. 

In that moment of accident and problem-solving, YOU are not my priority. The PATIENT is.

There are too many people to remember them all, so forgive me if I forget your name. I need your help, I don't know how I wound up in this situation but I seem to have been ground hog day'd. I have seen the world ending thousands of times and I need someone to help me.

It wasn't world ending apocalypses initially it started out with small things, I'd get hit by a car and die, so the next time round I would wait till the car went past, then cross the street. Just little things like that, after the first hundred or so times around though, things started to get a little more extreme, the first such example was a man with a knife who charged me and stabbed me to death, so I called the police ahead of time. They made it, stopped him from attacking me and hit me with a stray bullet when the knife man charged them. After that, I took a different route to the coffee shop. The first time I actually made it to the coffee shop a gas line exploded when I arrived and killed me, and, I assume everyone else there at the same time.

After that I decided to try and leave town, so I went to catch a train, which promptly derailed and took out everyone on the platform as it did so. The strange thing is though, that I checked the news while I was on the platform and the gas line didn't explode this time around.

That got me thinking, if bad things were only happening to kill me, what if I just stayed home and waited it out. Well, the only time I tried that I was the victim of a plane crash in my own livingroom. I decided that my best course of action was to wander the city for the day and do my best to be aware of my surroundings, and wouldn't you know it, it got me further than anything I'd tried so far, but ultimately failed when we were hit with a chemical weapon strike

At that point I came to the decision that I should stay away from crowds to minimize the casualties, the problem was that I didn't own a car, so my options were public transport or walk, and public transport hadn't treated me well today. I started walking first thing in the morning, by noon I was on the city outskirts with lifestyle blocks lining the highway. I made sure to stay well away from any vehicle that I saw on the road. That, of course, didn't stop the bombs from killing me. I turned around after the bright flash and, a couple seconds later, woke up back in my bed. The next few attempts I tried running, but for the first time, the exact cause of death repeated itself. That's when I realized that the only way to prevent an event was to be safely out of it's reach. I spent a few attempts trying to find the most accessable bike I could to “borrow”, after a few attempts I found that one of the bikes at the convenience store had been left unlocked. That time I made it to the next town over, turns out, they were quite earthquake prone. It took a few attempts, but I eventually found a safe spot to weather the earth quake.

The declaration of war came next several world leaders were assassinated all at once and everyone blamed everyone else, and then the missiles began to fly, and, surprise surprise, the first nuke hit the town in was in. Interestingly enough, if I didn't go to that town, the war didn't happen, I figured that since I was far enough from that first nuke that I didn't die immediately, then it had to be a different cause of death.

I had taken to keeping up with the news to try and avoid anything that seemed dangerous. I basically gave up when I saw that a virus had swept across more than half of the Continental United States in a matter of hours, leaving very few survivors in its wake. The experts were saying 97% of the population was dead within 5 minutes of first symptoms, and believe me, it was not a comfortable 5 minutes. After that I tried to break the loop myself a couple of times, if you catch my drift. That, evidently also didn't work. That's when I had an idea scuba gear should have enough oxygen for me to last at least the initial pass of the virus, and if the pattern holds, that meant that it wouldn't happen at all. I was right, I looked like an idiot in a stolen scuba mask, but I was right. That still didn't stop the meteor though, and that's where I've been stuck for the past few hundred days, 3.37pm, the world ends. And I don't know if there is any way, aside from breaking the time loop, to stop it. Which brings us to the reason I'm writing this now. I think I have figured out a way to break it. I've spent a few decades at this point studying mythology about time loops and I think I know which one I'm in.

Are you familiar with the concept of purgatory? Well, it's kind of like that, except, I'm not dead yet, it's a punishment and once I have made amends and attoned for my sins, I believe I will be set free. It also turns out that, by sharing my knowledge I have spread the reach of this curse. Thank you all, for taking on a portion of my suffering and making pennnance for my sins.

If you want my advice, don't dodge the car, it hurts a lot less than the feeling of you lungs liqufying in you chest.

Fifi had such a unique personality. Sweet, but cunning. Cuddly, but with an attitude. She would sit on my lap and purr calmly when I was having a coffee at 6 pm after work. She would follow me around the house and talk to me for hours. And curiously, she'd keep me company at all time when I was building what today is the home office I work at, supervising every corner like she was the ""master builder"" as I'd affectionately called her.

Her life was cut short when one day we suddenly found her with a spinal cord injury that left her crippled and couldn't afford to pay for the treatment. Even in this situation, she was filled with a strong will to live, and learned to walk again against all odds. She was a fighter, a true warrior. But life, in her infinite wisdom, knew she didn't deserve to suffer, and she peacefully passed away on my lap last night, surrounded by all those who deeply loved her for over 15 long years.

Ari Aster and A24 don’t miss.

We saw the film last night in Raleigh, a slow-burning, cerebral Neo-Western set in a small American town in early 2020, just as the world started tilting off its axis. Think Dr. Strangelove, but with cowboy hats, pandemic paranoia, and the slow erosion of collective reality.

It’s a film that doesn’t hit all at once. You walk out a little dazed, maybe even confused. But somewhere between the silence of the drive home and your second cup of coffee the next morning, it starts to click.

Everyone in Eddington cares. Every character feels that something is deeply wrong. They just can’t quite connect, lost in ideological echo chambers, chasing their own versions of truth, too distracted by the noise to see the bigger machine at work.

The real antagonist isn’t a person. It’s the force above us, the systems, the power structures, reshaping the world while we argue with each other over the symptoms.

And yet, the message isn’t hopeless. Quite the opposite.

Let’s be good Americans. Let’s be good neighbors.

Maybe that person on your feed posting things you don’t understand or agree with… maybe their passion is rooted in the same love for humanity that you have. They’re just responding to a different wound. A different echo of the same grief.

At its core, Eddington is about fractured unity. It reminds us that love and fear live close together, and that division is often a tool used to keep us distracted while power moves quietly forward.

He promised he’d change and he pretty much did, he stopped being suspicious about everything i did and accusing me of cheating…


….Until a few days ago when I forgot the password to my phone and spent 2 days trying to remember it before I had to erase it (we have each others locations for context) and it happened while he was at work. I couldn’t text him or anything so i told him everything when he got home…and he was being really weird. I saw him scanning my body as if he was looking for evidence someone had touched me. There was glitter on my face and he pointed it out in a way like “Hmmm wonder how that got there” and he was also like “The house smells different, i don’t know how to explain but it just smells different. You know anything about that?”  

From the outside it looks like harmless comments but I know him and that was definitely his way of being suspicious of me without outwardly accusing me. 

Then the next day, I still hadn’t remembered my password so at that point i started the process to erase it. He gets about an hour/hour and a half break at work and he always spends it (every single day since he started the job 2 years ago) having a lunch/coffee with his coworkers and doing small tasks to make the rest of his shift go easier. But that day he decided to come home.

His excuse was “he had extra break time and wanted to come give me a kiss” he was home for about 30 minutes total before he had to go back to work and spent it looking over my shoulder as i was trying to erase my phone. Oh and he didn’t have extra break time lol, he had the same break duration he’s always had. I had logged into my instagram on my computer at this point so we were able to text there and he didn’t say anything about coming home, he ALWAYS does. Like he wanted to catch me in the act or something.

Honorable mention, i went to see superman alone yesterday and told him about it. Later when he got home from work i saw the address of the movie theater i went to in his google searches. From my location…like he wanted to verify the address I was at was actually a movie theater.

Can this be changed?? How can i get him to trust me? I’ve always been 100% loyal and never given him a reason to think i would cheat.  He’s told me he’s never been cheated on, and I have no reason to believe he’s cheating considering how much of a homebody he is, the only places he goes is to work and the grocery store. A quick beer with his friends every now and then. I just don’t know what to do about this. We’re locked into a 1 year lease together which makes it even more difficult and harder to just walk away. The worst thing about all of this is he can easily try to claim he didn’t mean anything by any of this so I feel like I can’t even say anything

This was a dream come true we went from appartment living to a quiet homestead, RIP DonP.

She goes off birth control and in the 1st month living there she gets pregnant. What a blessing again but also a suprise and we were not married. In these events although blessed with ""gifts"" I felt out of control of my story, this all was just happening to me.

We have a beautiful baby and I say ""when she is old enough to remember and be in the wedding we will get married."" Then Covid happened. We both kept our jobs and again we were blessed with luck in a hard time. She got her ring (thanks to the stimulus check) and the nice people at the local jewlery store. The wedding was perfect. Just a small family, friend celebration in our back yard. My daughter threw rose pedals in the air as she walked so carefully to me in the ceramony. 

Time goes by we have problems with spending and money gets tight. My wifes health changes. She gets a bypass surgery for weight loss. Starts to drink excessively after that. And cuts her hair really short. Not my style but ok. I now have a mohawk so wtf. 

I get into some shady stuff on Onlyfans seeking connection with someone I find attractive. It was wrong and led to me confessing to my wife. As much as I tried I had fallen under findom addiction. I spent over $6000 in 3 years on selfish nude content. I have now supressed that addiction by seeking help but.
In my weak mental state yesterday I visited this 1on1 stripshow club. Spent $300 on a one hour show. I brought her a cold coffee and a breakfast burrito. She just worked the whole night and it was about 9:30am.
To me first impressions are the biggest gift in human socialization. I locked eyes in the dark showroom. We spend 20 minutes talking and eatting a burrito and have our coffee. I learn She is 28 single and travels to and from Las Vegas for shows. This youthful, long haired blonde with all a all natural look no tattoos or piercings, plump glossy lips, nice thighs and pretty white nails on her soft feet, perfect round tits. Amazing ass and a lazered pussy. She had a nice tan and a outline of a white heart where a sticker had been, like a innocent little temporary tattoo. So cute. I gave her 2 small spanks during the show and the whole time kept a conversation going that seemed effortless.
Had I met a perfect woman? So independant, funny, smart, creative, open minded, all the work of good parenting and childhood I imagine. My 1 hour was up and my heart was beginning to feel sadness that it was time for my goodbye.
On the drive home my wife calls, I say I have to ask to please let me support you and my child but I need for my own mentalhealth need a divorce. So after 13 years I went to my moms and slept alone last night on the couch.
I did keep messaging her on Instagram last night after the show and this just seemed like a sign that 1 hour in her company and messages after gave me so much to live for. Today I will restrain from messaging her. Or so I ask her out? I mean she is going to Las Vegas next week for a month.

I (35m) went on a date with a girl (29f) a couple of weeks ago. We just went for a walk and a coffee in the park. I'd say it went quite well and I messaged her after to say it was lovely to meet her and I thought she seemed really cool and down to earth (ie. I like you). She replied and said was lovely meeting you too, and that I was ""good vibes"". Anyway she was then going on vacation for 10 days but said we can ""defo"" do something when she gets back.

I didn't message her at all during her vacation, just left her to it. She got back earlier this week and so I messaged her saying, ""Hey, hope you had fun in (vacation location)! I'd love to hear all about it, do you have any plans this weekend? 👀"". Ie. I'd like to see you again this weekend if you're free. 

She got back to me the following day saying, ""Hey it was amazing thanks! I was back at work today, so depressing. This weekend I'm actually so busy catching up with people and I'm shattered after my first day back at work."" 

Do I even bother replying? Would be nice if she said I'm busy this weekend but I'm free on X day, but she didn't. This says to me that she's not really that interested. 

I either don't reply, or just reply saying ""No worries hope you have a nice weekend catching up with your friends"" and leave it at that. She can get back in touch if she wants to.

1m3uhr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLoga/comments/1m3uhr7/why_do_exchange_rates_change_its_not_magic_its/,Why do exchange rates change? It’s not magic — It’s just the market doing its thing,"Let’s be honest — most people don’t wake up in the morning wondering *""Hmm, I wonder what the euro-to-dollar rate is doing today?""* But if you've ever tried to exchange money before a trip, sent crypto abroad, or traded on [Bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274), you *know* that those little numbers can make a big difference. One day you're getting a good deal, the next… not so much.

So — what’s the deal? Why do exchange rates keep bouncing around like a hyperactive squirrel?

# 1. Supply and demand (Yep, the classic rule still applies)

If everyone suddenly wants Japanese yen — maybe because Japan just dropped interest rates or Apple’s building a megafactory in Osaka — the demand for yen shoots up. That demand makes the yen more valuable. Flip the situation? The yen weakens.

Think of it like concert tickets. If Beyoncé announces a one-night-only show and there are only 5,000 seats, prices skyrocket because everyone’s scrambling to get in. Currencies kind of work the same way, just less glitter.

# 2. Interest rates and inflation: The nerdy duo

Let’s break this down without sounding like a textbook: Countries with higher interest rates *usually* attract more foreign investment. Why? Because investors wanna earn more on their money. More demand for that currency = stronger exchange rate.

But wait — inflation can mess with that. If prices inside a country are rising like crazy, it erodes purchasing power. And guess what? That’s not sexy to investors. So a country might offer high interest rates, but if inflation's off the charts? Meh.

# 3. Politics and chaos (A global favorite)

Ever noticed how currency markets *freak out* during elections, wars, or unexpected coups? Yeah. Political stability — or the lack of it — has a major impact on confidence. And confidence (or panic) drives money in or out of a country like a stampede.

You don’t need a PhD to know that if a government’s acting shady or things are blowing up — literally or economically — people are gonna pull their funds out. Fast.

# 4. Economic reports, rumors, and headlines that make you spit your coffee

Sometimes it's not even hard facts — just the *expectation* of what might happen. A leaked report here, a central bank hint there, and bam — the markets go nuts. Exchange rates are sensitive creatures. Even whispers make them jump.

And with how fast news spreads? It’s like trying to calm a cat in a thunderstorm. Good luck.

# 5. Speculation: The market’s rollercoaster operator

Let’s not ignore the elephant in the room — traders. When big players *think* a currency will go up or down, they start moving serious money around. And those moves? They shift exchange rates too.

It’s like someone yelling ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater. Even if there’s no flame, people still run.

# So… What does this mean for you?

Whether you're a traveler, a business owner, or just someone swapping stablecoins on [Bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274), it pays to know what’s moving the numbers behind the curtain. No need to become an economist overnight, but understanding the basics? That’s smart.

Plus, at Bitloga, we’re all about transparency. Live exchange rates. No BS. And if you're ever unsure, our support team actually *answers* like humans (weird, right?).

**TL;DR** Exchange rates change for all kinds of reasons — economic shifts, political drama, market gossip, or just plain ol' human behavior. But you don’t need to stress. With tools like [Bitloga.com](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274), you’ve got real-time info at your fingertips — so you're never caught off guard when it's time to make a move.",1,1752926400.0,BitLoga,0,1.0,False

I work in an amusement arcade and we offer free drinks and snacks for playing customers. Some people try and abuse this by coming in, asking for something they leaving once they have it, or we've also had supposed homeless people coming in asking for drinks and snacks 'because I'm homeless'  

When I first started and wasn't so savvy a guy came in and asked for a coffee, and not knowing any better I gave him a coffee, whereafter he walked out immediately. Same guy came in this morning and went straight in the customer toilet where he spent 10 minutes before coming out and politely asking for a coke. 'Sure, take a seat and I'll bring it over once you're playing' I replied and carried on filling in my paperwork. He went and sat down and just sat rubbing his eyes. Five minutes later he came back to the bar. 'My mouth is so dry can I have that coke now please?' He asked with a big smile on his face 'Sure, once you're playing' I repeated politely. The smile disappeared from his face 'I'm entitled to a drink by law' he snarled 'No you're not. They're for playing customers only' I replied politely 'No I'm entitled to one by law' he repeated 'No, you're definitely not. They're for playing customers you haven't played yet. Start playing and you can have a drink' I replied. He turned around and headed to the door telling me to go and f@@k myself I followed him as I needed to unlock the door and he turned before leaving and said 'why won't you let me just have one coke?' I said they're for customers only again he says 'I am a customer' I replied that he'd come in and used the toilet and hadn't played a machine the refreshments were for playing customers he called me a fat b@@@@@d and said (again 🙄) 'I'm entitled to a drink by law I know I am' I replied 'No problem go and find a cop and report me' before closing the door

1m3ufse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1m3ufse/shenanigan_squad_nurse_nefarious_take_down/,Shenanigan Squad: Nurse Nefarious Take Down!,"Setting: St Somewhere Epilepsy Clinic. Inside, Nurse Nefarious rules from her nurse’s station like a petty tyrant on a paper throne. She’s surrounded by three broken fax machines and seventeen unreturned patient voicemails.

Nurse Nefarious, snapping: “No, you can’t see your neurologist unless your EEG is written in calligraphy, on a scroll, delivered by a unicorn!”

She stamps a form aggressively. Then sneers.

Cue Spark.

Golden fur glinting. Vest strapped tight. Eyes full of wholesome rebellion. Behind him, the Shenanigan Squad rolls in: Sia the Medical Cat, wearing aviators and her high-tech paralegal collar. Delta, floating in her flowerpot, with glittering spores and a serious attitude. Jimmy the Parrot, pirate-squawking medical terms to people trying to figure out their forms.

Sia calmly, to Nurse Nefarious: “You’ve been violating ADA guidelines since 8:07 this morning.”

Nurse Nefarious, scoffing: “Animals don’t get to lecture me on procedure!”

Delta, cheerfully: “How about plants?”

She releases a cloud of lavender glitter-mist. The room instantly feels like a spa. Nurse Nefarious coughs.

Jimmy flaps up onto the counter. “Diagnosis is ‘toxic attitude with side effects of shame’!”

Sia leans forward, tail twitching like a lawyer on closing argument.

Sia: “You’ve been gatekeeping care, turning people away with paperwork and cruelty. You’re not helping. You’re harming.”

Nurse Nefarious reaches for her buzzer—only for Spark to leap onto the counter, knocking over her fortress of unnecessary forms.

Spark, bark-translated via collar Rick installed: “Patients are not problems. They’re people… Our people!”

Suddenly—alarms go off. Chaos erupts.

Delta zips forward, blasting the sprinkler system with a calming mist. The hallway turns into a glowy disco forest.

Jimmy, circling: “Sidekick uprising! Clear the waiting room! We’re triaging with kindness!”


The Shenanigan Squad spreads out: Spark guides patients to the real neurologist’s office. Delta helps a waiting lady laugh instead of cry. Jimmy yells random insurance loopholes into Nurse Nefarious’ intercom. And Sia? She’s disappeared into Schrodinger‘s Cat mode. Both there and not there.


Nurse Nefarious, cornered: “You can’t just change the system!”

Sia stepping forward, voice calm but lethal: “We already are.”

Spark hits the Big Red Button labeled “Secondary Referral System Override”.

Every patient in the waiting room gets a real appointment. With someone who listens.


Spark barks again. Shenanigan Squad: Assemble and roll out.

They leave behind a broken clipboard. And a stunned Nurse Nefarious with a weed leaf stuck to her forehead. And a waiting room full of patients… finally smiling.

 A short while later… St. Somewhere Medical Pavilion – ADMINISTRATION OFFICE

Setting: A cold, beige hallway. A sign that reads “Authorized Staff Only – Management Beyond This Point.” Nurse Nefarious storms in, nostrils flaring, clipboard smoking from overuse.

Nurse Nefarious mutters: “Animals taking over my triage? A talking CAT? This has gone TOO FAR!”

She kicks open the office door, ready to unleash her wrath upon the Director of Patient Operations… only to find—

Sia sitting on the desk. She is wearing a rhinestone lanyard and a badge that reads:

SIA – Patient Experience Consultant, Esq. (and Feline Queen)

Behind her, a projector plays a looped video titled: “How Not to Alienate Your Chronically Ill Patients: A Guide to Compassion & Compliance.” Sia’s voice narrates.

Sia cool and professional: “Hello, Nefarious. We’ve been expecting you.”

Nurse Nefarious freezes and then stutters out: “B-but- you were- y-you…”

A calm HR rep smiles and sips coffee.

HR Rep, cheerfully: “Oh good, you’re here for your sensitivity re-certification. Please take a seat. Sia left paw prints on the sign-in sheet just for you.”

Nurse Nefarious, sputtering: “WHAT?! This is my domain! I run triage! I make the rules!”

Sia’s voice, still narrating from the video: “…Gatekeeping care is not a superpower. It’s a lawsuit in slow motion.”

Nurse Nefarious grabs her clipboard like a lifeline: “I—I’ll go to the BOARD!”

HR Rep, scrolling on their tablet: “They’re watching the livestream. With popcorn. Sia’s presentation went viral.”

Suddenly, the wall screen cuts to footage of Spark, Delta, Jimmy, and Sia leading patients to actual care. Background music? “I Need a Hero,” but it’s a cover performed entirely by parakeets and a Baby Delta.

Sia, sweetly: “Also, I’ve just reassigned you.”

Nurse Nefarious, panicking: “Reassigned?!”

Sia: “To the Department of Waiting Room Chair Comfort Optimization. You’ll be replacing all the broken seats.”

HR Rep: “Starting with the ones chewed by Delta. They requested extra padding and calming aromatherapy.”

Nurse Nefarious, broken: “This… is a… Catastrophe…”

Sia, smug: “No, darling. It’s purrfect.”

Nurse Nefarious groans.

From far down the hall, Spark howls with glee.

A while ago I posted some date ideas, and since then I’ve noticed a big increase in posts from people who are feeling a bit isolated or looking to socialise more. So I thought I’d put together a list of ways to meet people without it being weird or awkward.

These are Wexford Town focused (sorry New Ross/Gorey/Enniscorthy gang) I’ve broken it down into easy / medium / hard based on how naturally you can strike up a convo and not feel like a total weirdo.
Any new Ross/gorey/ENNISCORTHY stuff is not my forte

I'll go through these by easy, medium and hard

Easy 🟩🟢💚

Meet ups -

https://www.meetup.com/wexford-social-group/

Exactly what it says on the tin. They organise board game nights, coffee meet ups, and book clubs/writing clubs

Red books 

Events are easiest, they also are laid back if you literally just are browsing, nice easy to meet artsy types

https://www.instagram.com/redbookswexford/?hl=en

Social basketball

https://wexfordbasketball.ie/

You'll have to contact them for current training times but they have a weekly social mens basketball and a social women's

Social running

Super chill vibes for a run group. Easy way to meet people and talk. 


Remote worker meetup

Super chill, obviously limited to remote workers but an active group and super nice

**HELMUT**  
Always.

She gives him a look that says, *don’t lie to me*.

Helmut exhales, shrugs.

**HELMUT (CONT'D)**  
Just—long day, long week, long watch. Same as everyone.

She closes the analyzer gently, turning her attention to him.

**MIA**  
You been in the sim again?

He nods.

---  

**HELMUT**  
Yeah. That *Expeditions and Misadventures* holodisk you filed months ago, the one marked “Noir.” You ever open it?

**MIA**  
I thought it was corrupted. *Noir?*

**HELMUT** *(a tired grin)*  
Oh, it runs. Rough edges and all.

**MIA**  
What’s it about?

Helmut stirs his coffee, eyes distant.

**HELMUT**  
It’s about a mouse—kinda. It’s about a crew, trying to pull off something that might save them, or ruin them, or maybe get them just one more day in the sun. It’s about—*I don’t know*. Hope, I guess.

**MIA** *(smirking)*  
Hope in a “Noir” file?

**HELMUT**  
It’s…funny like that.

---  

They sit. The starfield crawls past.

Helmut glances at her, the edge of a conspiratorial smile forming.

**HELMUT (CONT'D)**  
We should do a run together. One of these off-cycles. You, me, running a *misadventure* before we’re old and stuck behind consoles forever.

**MIA** *(teasing)*  
You’re already old.

**HELMUT** *(mock hurt)*  
Wow.

They laugh, softly, the sound warm against the cold hum of the ship.

---  

**MIA** *(softer)*  
You really think it’s worth it? The misadventure?

Helmut’s eyes are tired, but alive.

**HELMUT**  
Yeah. This one character reminds me of you, even if it’s just code. Anyways, *while we’re still out here*.

A silence.

**MIA** *(nodding)*  
Okay. Next off-cycle.

They clink their mugs.

I’m (25M) based in Sector 9A, Gurgaon, and I’ve been looking to expand my social circle. It’s been tough meeting people lately, so I thought I’d put this out here.

I’d love to connect with like-minded folks (any gender, no dating/NSFW intentions at all) who might be up for casual meetups like:

 - Gym sessions 🏋️

 - Weekend swimming 🏊

 - Chilling over coffee or exploring the city ☕🚶

 - Maybe even catching a movie or doing something fun outdoors 🎬🌳

I know one girl that I like and I think she also likes me. I will tell you everything chronologically so you can get the better picture of it.

Just also to mention that this is more of a situationships than real relationship.

Signs she might be into me:

1. When we were talking like in march this year we really got closer (we both go on a same college) and we were always on a coffee meetings in between lectures.

2. LATE FEBRUARY AND MARCH We developed some kind of a connection and she once mentioned how our relationship is strange and then she stopped and I didn't say anything. Then she said how her saying that I'm smart is a good sign to her. Of course we were constantly flirting and she was always looking me directly in the eyes.

3. THE END OF MARCH AND START OF APRIL Later I was constantly thinking about her and then I asked her for a snapchat and she said to me playfully ""I will write somewhere how long did it take you to ask me for a snapchat"". I simply laugh at it.

4. THE END OF APRIL AND BEGINNING OF MAY Then I had started analyzing her and I realized that she is very guarded individual and that's why she never initiates meetings nor messaging first. I also concluded that she might had some past trauma (relationship issues in the past) that reflects this behavior. She also rarely sent snaps to me.

5. THE END OF APRIL AND BEGINNING OF MAY I told her my analysis of her and she was firstly like delighted to hear that and told me how I'm like 30% correct. Two days after when I brought this up again she told me how I'm completely wrong about it. Then the third time I said that to her she crossed her arms, then her eyes got watery and she looked like she was about to cry but didn't.



THE COFFEE MEETING INCIDENT

So there was an incident in May this year (7th of may to be precise) where she lied about that one coffee meeting.



So little backstory for a context.

There is this one girl from our class, let's call her Emily and also one guy, let's call him John. John is into Emily but Emily isn't into him. He was constantly inviting her for a coffee and she always denied. Then on 6th may she told me and my crush (let's call her Anna) about that coffee meeting. I was sitting next to them and Emily told us how John invited her for a coffee next day (may 7th) after a lecture, my crush said she would also go with them.



The may 7th

I was taking a tram to my college and before my exit on a tram station I saw them on coffee in this caffee from a tram. I've seen them through glass window because it was a cloudy day and there was no light interference. I really thought nothing about it because I knew from day before they would actually go on that coffee.



The may 8th

We were finishing a class and we've got some time (hour and half) for a coffee (My crush, Emily and me) and Emily started telling me and my crush a story how she was yesterday on a coffee with John and he was pushy and invasive. Later on the end of the meeting he gave her a hug. The interesting thing is that I saw my crush with them and my crush was listening this story as she didn't know anything.



The next monday, may 12th

The first class in the morning and when it finished we also got time for a coffee and John has rushed to my crush and asked her for a coffee. She coldly told him ""If you want"" and she continued with her classmates. They left him at the bakery and didn't wait him and I asked him if he is willing to go on a coffee with me. He agreed. Later I saw my crush and she said to me ""Did you see today how John asked me for a coffee, isn't that strange?"" I replied ""That's why I invited him"" She said ""It's good you did that"".



Tuesday May 13th

I gave my crush a stuffed penguin keychain and she was happy to see it and was blushing all over. She also said how she would put him on her original home keys for the summer. Then, moments later I confronted her about that coffee meeting. She was avoidant and dismissive and tried to make her story fits in there.

Her main arguments:

1. She was wearing a bun a whole day and I saw her without one (on that coffee meeting)

2.She also showed me a picture of her at 3.40pm with her friends (with a bun) but I saw her there at 2.40pm.

3. I'm lying.



Then she said that I'm very paranoid and I need to chill out. She also got offended later and told me she would need two weeks to ""forgive me"". Then I started feeling isolated with a broken trust. Then I suspected she lose feelings for me. Then I removed her on snapchat because why I should keep someone there if they don't respond nor send back. When I said I removed her on snap she just said ""I kinda expected that because I'm not that active there"". But keep in mind she has like 200k snapscore.



The great confrontation

I had confronted her again about that coffee meeting and how I did it is astonishing. I told her that I was on a coffee with John and that he told me everything. She of course denied and I told her how I know the reason. She kept insisting on me telling her the reason why she lied. I played with her for a while and said that the real reason might be that she lied simply because John was flirting with her and she didn't want to tell that because she is into me. She said that we're just good friends. The call ended. The very next day I confronted her via call more harshly (I didn't use any slurs) and told her that she is manipulative and that in this game if someone shows vulnerability losses but both parties will lose if we keep playing this game. There were two choices; one is that someone steps out of this game and other is that we both stay in deadlock. She said how nobody was that harsh. Then the call ended and I wrote her a message on whatsapp and it was this ""I really liked you and thought it was mutual but I can't keep seeing someone who lies"". She replied with ""I told you that nobody forces you to hang out with someone that you find non-compatible."" Then two days later I told her again that I'm sorry and would like to start over this relation with her. She told me that she values my apology but doesn't want to try keeping this relation. Then I tried to persuade her and she left me on seen and then she replied how she knows I feel sorry but that I need to give her time because if I'm pushing it I'm only making it worse.

Then I asked her again in two weeks how is she doing and in short she says how she forgave me but can't talk to me as she used to but sometimes she can say hello and talk but it wouldn't be the same as before. Then I got mad because she lied to me and forgive me what? Like and I told her there is no in between, we either somehow rebuild the relationship or totally seperate. Then she told me how I am a good guy but need to change because I will hurt so much more people if I continue to be harsh. Then I said to her she can throw my gift (penguin keychain) or give it to someone else because she lacks empathy and can forget me and I will forget her, it should be easy for her to forget me because she lacks empathy. She just said ""Okay"". Neither of us blocked each other after that. Then minute after this I texted Emily about that lie at coffee shop and then she left me on seen for one hour and then she replied how Anna wasn't there and I shouldn't be like that towards her etc. she also like doesn't have time for drama etc. She also told me how I should ask John about it and I told her he already told me and she replied how she doesn't understand everything but ok.

TLDR; My crush is obviously lying and now we're seperated because of that. She is showing a sign of emotional manipulation and triangulation.",0,1752925948.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

How many times has a girl actually asked you out? Not on dating apps — I mean in real life.

Was it casual, serious, or just a friendly vibe?

As the world evolves, people grow more advanced—empowered by knowledge. Yet the real problem lies in their assumption: that humans understand everything.

But some things exist beyond imagination. Beyond thought.

This world is woven with belief and fate. Nearly everyone worships divine gods—or, in rarer cases, devils. These beliefs spark rituals. Stories. Some uplifting. Some terribly dark.

This is a story about someone caught in such a web.

Max wasn’t just a college sports star—he was the kind of boy who thrived in the spotlight but feared the silence. Beneath his playful arrogance was a hunger: not just for fame, but for proof. Proof that the world’s fears were fake. That belief was a superstition waiting to be mocked.

His YouTube channel wasn’t just content—it was rebellion. He broke taboos, flirted with the dark, dared society to punish him. And his audience adored him. Or they used to… before the comment.

One Sunday morning, while sipping coffee and scrolling through praise and controversy, Max froze. A comment stood out from the rest. It was posted by a user named Mr. Redhand:

“Stop playing with the other world, kid. Some things lie beyond human imagination. Your generation won’t believe it—but if you want to know the truth, visit Blackblood Lake near your city.”



Max blinked. The name. The wording. It felt… ancient. Not fake. Not part of a prank. It unsettled him—raised goosebumps on his neck. Yet that was exactly what pulled him in.

Curiosity won.

He packed lightly and left without telling his crew. No one knew where he’d gone.

He arrived at Blackblood Lake when night merged with silence. The sky hung low. The water flowed like blood—silent, deep, and impossibly black.

Max settled on the shore. He read about the lake’s cursed reputation: a portal to the other world. Rituals of black magic. Summoners lost to madness. Entities born from belief. So dangerous that the government had declared the lake forbidden decades ago.

Max chuckled.

“What could go wrong? It’s just a lake. The trap was set, I guess.”





 The Vanishing

Seven days passed.

A search team finally found Max near a jagged rock formation beside the lake. His clothes were torn. His skin bruised. His hands trembled like he was clutching invisible horrors.

But it was his eyes—plucked out cleanly, sockets hollow and scarred—that truly broke those who saw him.

He wasn’t screaming.

He wasn’t crying.

He was laughing. Manically.

Max spoke in fragments of unknown languages. Ancient dialects no one could decipher. Between his bouts of madness, he repeated the same line over and over:

“She is beautiful… hahahah… beautiful…”



And then, he began kissing the stone. Stroking it. Humping it like an animal possessed.

Doctors diagnosed him with severe dissociative psychosis. But the medications did nothing. Every midnight, Max’s laughter aligned perfectly with whispers no one else could hear. Surveillance footage recorded nothing. Yet his room temperature would plummet. Shadows moved without light. And Max began biting his own hands.



 The Lake Awakens

As the story spread, rumors reawakened Blackblood Lake’s legend.

Max’s YouTube channel—disabled and forgotten—suddenly began uploading again.

The videos were distorted. Static-filled. Glitched. One showed a red handprint smearing across the lens. Another showed Max—eyes intact, smiling strangely, blood on his chin—whispering:

“The lake remembers.”



The comment section grew corrupted. Cryptic symbols. Dozens of accounts posting the same phrase:

“She is watching.”



One of the usernames? Mr. Redhand.

 The Price of Belief

Visitors returned to the lake.

Some disappeared.

Some returned—changed. Silent. Pale. One girl was found drawing spirals on the wall of her room, mumbling “It’s coming through...” every time the wind stirred.

A priest attempted to seal the area with ancient rites. He vanished within forty-eight hours. All that remained was his Bible—its pages soaked, illustrations replaced by crude drawings of hollow eyes and an entity made of fingers.

A journalist traced Max’s lineage and found a half-burned journal in his home. The final page wasn’t written by him—or anyone modern. It simply read:

“The veil is thin. Belief fuels entry. She doesn’t need permission… only attention.”





Truth… or Madness?

What happened to Max that night?

Was the lake a doorway? A punishment? A relic of something older than religion?

And who—or what—is Mr. Redhand?

Some say he isn’t real.

Others say he watches through cameras, living in your clicks. That every story told about him gives him shape.

But no one knows.

Max doesn't speak anymore.

Not during the day.

Only at midnight.

And if you slow down one of his corrupted videos… listen through the static…

Have you ever felt like you're just spinning your wheels as a creator? Like you’re pouring so much time and effort into your content, but the idea of actually *monetizing* it seems like a far-off dream? Yeah, I’ve been there too! 🎢 

But here’s the thing: just because you’re new to this game doesn’t mean you have to stay in “beginner mode” forever. 

**Let’s dive into 5 killer tools that can help you monetize your AI content like a pro—*right now*!** 💰

1. **Patreon: Your Audience, Your Rules.**
   - Seriously, this platform lets you connect directly with your followers. Ever thought about offering exclusive behind-the-scenes content or personalized AI prompts? This could be your golden ticket!

2. **Ko-fi: Because Everyone Deserves Coffee. ☕**
   - This one is super approachable! You can set up a simple page to let your audience buy you a coffee to show appreciation for your work. It’s a nice little way to monetize without having to dive too deep into the “sales” scene.

3. **Teachable: Turn Knowledge into Cash.**
   - Got something valuable to teach? Whether it’s tutorials on using AI tools or tips on creating compelling content, you can create an online course and charge for access. You'd be surprised how many folks are eager to pay for quality info!

4. **Substack: Newsletters, but Make it Monetized.**
   - If you enjoy writing and have insights to share, why not create a paid newsletter? It’s like chatting with friends, but they’re paying for your wisdom! Who doesn’t love a little extra *ka-ching* while sharing thoughts?

5. **Etsy: Selling Digital Products.**
   - You might think Etsy's just for cute crafts, but think again! Ever considered putting together a bundle of digital products—like templates, prompts, or even AI-generated art? It’s all about selling creativity these days!

I estimate I need to descale every 2.5 weeks, this is a family device, brewing approx 8-10 cups per day all with frothed milk, so estimate a descale every 150-200 cups.  The water is fairly hard, enough to get a film of limescale in the kettle over that period (I reuse the Nespresso descale solution for the kettle).   So typically get through a 2 pack of descaler per month.

I have read that typically it should be 600 drinks per descale, but possibly as we all drink milky coffee and the water is hard, 200 is reasonable.  My old basic Nespresso rarely got descaled, probably once per year at most, so having to purchase so much more descaler is a surprise.

If frequent descaling is the hidden cost of this machine I’m ok with that, it makes it more expensive but I consider the better coffee is worth the extra.  But if it’s caused by a faulty machine I’ll send it back for a service and see if I can save some money!

Morning dawned with a sickly green light filtering through the curtains of Sal's back room, where we'd retreated after our narrow escape from Mayflower Park. Outside, a heavy fog blanketed Fanhattan, turning the city into a ghostly landscape.

""Perfect Swamp weather,"" Lady Luck—or Zsa Zsa, as I now knew her—remarked, peering through a gap in the curtains. ""They'll be out in force today.""

""Who will?"" I asked, still groggy from exhaustion. Using the stadium card had drained me more than I'd realized, and I'd crashed hard as soon as we reached safety.

""Gator fans,"" she replied. ""They thrive in this weather. Say it reminds them of home.""

I sat up on the makeshift cot Sal had provided, wincing as my stiff muscles protested. My bag had gone slightly askew during sleep, and I quickly readjusted it, ensuring my face remained covered.

Sal entered with a tray of coffee and what smelled like freshly baked pastries. ""Rise and shine, kid. We got planning to do.""

""Has anyone heard from Shep and Fade God?"" I asked, gratefully accepting a steaming mug.

""Shep's tending bar, keeping an eye out for Syndicate activity,"" Sal said. ""Fade God's running probability models for our Swamp excursion.""

I took a careful sip of coffee through the bag, a skill I'd perfected over the past few days. ""So we're still going? Even after last night?""

Sal and Lady Luck exchanged glances.

""Especially after last night,"" Lady Luck said. ""Mamba's involvement means they're escalating. We need to find your sister before they do.""

I nodded, pulling out the stadium card to examine it. After its activation and subsequent use, it had entered a dormant state, the illustration now showing an empty stadium with a ""CLOSED"" sign across the gates.

*CARD STATUS: ""The Perfect Season""* 

*Cooldown: 10 hours 17 minutes remaining* 

*Energy: 12% available (emergency use only)*

""It's recharging,"" I explained. ""Won't be at full power for another ten hours.""

""That's okay,"" Lady Luck said. ""We need time to prepare anyway. The Swamp isn't like Vol Valley. We can't bluff our way in with orange t-shirts and temporary passes.""

Yeah, the anniversaries and family vacations are great, but those aren’t what keep your marriage running on all cylinders. It’s the quiet, everyday victories that hold it together.

I’m talkin’ about things like:
	•	The kids didn’t argue over the remote.
	•	Your spouse remembered how you like your coffee.
	•	Nobody brought up the ex. Hallelujah.
	•	You actually laughed together after a rough day.
	•	You prayed, even if it was short and awkward.

Blended families come with extra layers. It can feel like mixing two different toolboxes and hoping nothing jams up the gears. But every time something clicks, even a little bit—you celebrate that.

Why?
Because God celebrates it.

“Do not despise small beginnings…” – Zechariah 4:10

You don’t need to throw a party. Sometimes a high-five, a kind word, or just saying, “Hey, that was a win today,” is enough to shift the mood.

If you’re always waiting for the “big moments,” you’ll miss the beauty of what God’s doing in the process.

So yeah. Celebrate the small stuff. Not to keep score, but to build unity. To train your heart to look for God’s hand in the mess.

You’re not failing just because it’s hard. You’re building. And every win counts.

**Battery Type:** Most replacement batteries for the Omen HP-17-an188nr are Lithium-ion (Li-ion) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-Po).

- coffee maker and explicitly stopped working and stopped brewing. I had to push the fellow support team to honor the warranty and send a replacement. I was finally able to get a replacement sent.

- the first brew basket broke shortly after. The handles are cheap and poorly designed and our essential for the coffee maker to work.

- we had the leftover brew basket from the last coffee maker and were able to just use that. Until it broke and we can no longer make coffee again.  I did reach out to fellow this time and they sent me a replacement as part of the warranty.

- then the grinder stopped working. One day the grinder just stopped grinding. We cleaned it, banged all the old ground grounds out of it, and did everything we can and it just stopped working. At that point it wouldn’t even turn on. I reached out to fellow and they sent me a replacement.

- most recently our fellow coffee maker showerhead plastic broke. I had to reach out to fellow and they did send a replacement.

We purchased our products under a year ago and have had nothing but problems. The materials in plastics they use are cheap and unreliable. I’m positive that when our warranty ends, we have to get a new coffee maker a new grinder because I will refuse to pay fellow more money for their cheap products. 

If you’re considering a fellow coffee maker and grinder, I would seriously reconsider and go with a Moccamaster or something within the same price range that’s more reliable.

1m3tvgz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3tvgz,Took pics near a public shoot with ‘Sindh Police Pakistan’ barricades at Sukhna Lake. Got threatened for existing.,"So I have this little Saturday ritual: coffee in Sector 7 or 8, then a quiet walk near the end of Sukhna Lake by the wildlife sanctuary. Today, that peaceful routine got hijacked by some strange film or show shoot happening right out in the open.

There were barricades marked “Sindh Police Pakistan” and walls covered in Urdu, but no signs, no clear production team IDs, no one warning people it was a closed set. It was all set up casually in a public place—not private property.

I got curious, snapped a couple of pics, and politely asked one of the men nearby what they were shooting.

Instead of answering like a normal human, the guy snapped at me:

> “What’s wrong with you? Are you stupid? Why are you taking photos? Some things aren’t meant to be recorded. Delete them. Right now.”



I didn’t engage. I just walked away. But then I noticed someone else literally chasing me down and filming me—like I was the intruder or doing something illegal.

Let’s be clear here:

This was not a private set.

This was a public space open to everyone.

I didn’t interfere, didn’t trespass, didn’t touch a single thing.

Taking photos in a public area isn’t a crime—threatening someone for it is.


The entitlement? The fake power trip? Honestly, it’s laughable.

So to the random guy who thought screaming at a stranger would make him feel important:
Enjoy going on your little power trips in public places. I hope whatever you were filming bombs hard at the box office, and may your entire career be as mediocre and forgettable as the attitude you threw around today.

Some of us just want a peaceful walk.
You chose violence over basic courtesy.
Pathetic.

1m3tsp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARAM/comments/1m3tsp7/itemization_and_role_fulfillment/,Itemization and role fulfillment,"First of all, let's get the but it's just ARAM mentality out of the way. ARAM is still a 5v5 game mode, and you rely on teammates just as much as on the rift.

Having said that, players should take advantage of the fact that they aren't risking any LP and try thinking for themselves what to build instead of mindlessly building from the recommended page, which in fact is a pile of shit.

A few examples are:

Luden's instead of BFT. Specially against tanks. Except on very few champions that can take advantage of the poke. And even then, the burn and ap scaling will give you more ap and a better passive late game.

Double mana item on mages, take presence of mind instead. I'd bet if you're taking the recommended runes you already have it equipped, so there's no need to be full mana every single minute of the game. You'll have enough regeneration from the rune+1 mana item. Exceptions are (Ryze, Anivia, Kassadin). Taking clarity is a no no on high level ARAM, fyi.

Not building liandry's against tanks, or even on champions who's identity revolves around the dot burn. I've seen plenty of brands, rumbles, teemos not building it because after 2 items the recommended page stops recommending it.

Malignance just for R cd. I've seen Rumbles building it because it shows on his recommended page. This is just dumb itemization. Rumble can certainly benefit from the R cd or even the haste in general. But too much haste will make you overheat quicker than expected, so you'll still have to wait to use your abilities even if they've come up from cd to not overheat in the middle of a fight. I've also seen Jannas build the item, but that is just clearly someone who thinks microwaving an instant cup of coffee is the equivalent of cooking. Not even gonna bother explaining why this is bad.

Collector first item. Specially on ranged champions. Collector's passive is quite unreliable, and it has less AD than say, Yoummus just to name one item. I'm looking at you poke Varus players, who never aa once the whole game.

Malphite and Karma AP, when your team has enough damage and just need some kind of frontline/survivability. Karma's shielding/healing build can give your entire team a \~400-500 hp shield every 15-20 seconds, that's more than a locket on a very short cd. Make use of it and carry your team through supporting, damage isn't the only stat in the game. Malphite AP is an entire discussion, but to just state the obvious, you're cucking the champion, making him wait for cds, when his (their?) whole identity is to be the face of an insurmountable fucking rock mountain.

On-hit Kayle. The AS is capped at 2.5/second, why are you building 5 AS items + greaves? Specially to hug the tower and only auto the wave for 15 min. Read the champions kit and see for yourself 2 AS items + AP will give you, more penetration, more damage on all your abilities and heal you more from w. You'll be able to turn and carry fights easier if you just build properly. Liche is a great item on Kayle, always has been.

There are plenty of more examples, these are the main offenders I've encountered. Add on the comments which ones you can think of and let's have this discussion so everyone can benefit from a rising quality of games just from itemization and role fulfillment.

I usually avoid fruit flavors (I was in a hurry when I bought these lol) It also seems to be suitable for milk drinks, which means it might be suitable for people looking for lighter flavors, but I'm still concerned about that. It also seems to have a citrusy flavor from the smell. And the dried processing.

I will try it tomorrow and will use boiling temperature for stronger flavor.

Asking her if she’s okay, sitting there while she vents to me (even though it ends up in her blaming me for most of the way she’s feeling), small things like making her coffees, running her a bath, giving her backrubs pretty much every day, going out my way to buy her drinks from the shop as she cant drink water (childhood trauma reasons, long story) and just being there to hold her and show her affection, remind her how loved she is, and also giving her the space when she needs it.
But every time I ( 25M ) try and express my feelings about anything, or tell her that I’m feeling a little secluded or somethings not right, she’s on the defensive straight away telling me I never show her support, never care for her, starts calling me names like “pathetic” and a “c*nt” for saying that I feel a certain way. So recently I’ve stopped expressing how I feel, and just saying “nothing my love, I’m fine” when she asks, and then she gets angry at me for not telling her, calls me a liar and says things like “great so now I’m made to look/feel like the c*nt, thanks.” and says that when I try and explain why I feel this way she tells me its all excuses and I “always make it about myself”.
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. She says she loves me and wants to spend her life with me, but I just don’t feel wanted or loved right now.
We haven’t been intimate in the bedroom for best part of a year now, and that’s fair enough because she’s been through a lot and and she says that I have to wait for her to come to me, but she hasn’t tried even once? And every time I even put my hand on her leg, or on hold her hip whilst we’re cuddling she tells me all I give a fuck about is sex, and starts a huge argument with me, when clearly that’s not the case otherwise I would have been gone ages ago when it stopped. We used to be so active, and so intimate, and now I just feel like she’s disgusted by me. I don’t what to do. I feel so alone.

I’ve tried asking if I’m doing anything wrong, or if I need to change anything about myself or how I’m acting but again she calls me selfish and says im only considering my own feelings. I never consider my own, I always put her as a priority but Every single time I say that I’m feeling off (which id rarely that I say anything for this exact reason) she flips her lid at tells me I’m selfish.

1m3tjy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mywifesdarksecrets/comments/1m3tjy8/despite_a_very_active_sex_life_my_wife_spends_a/,Despite a very active sex life my wife spends a crazy amount of time daily masturbating.,"Like the title says my wife has always had a very active sex life and despite this it's still shocking how often she masturbates.

We started having sex when we were 13. Since both of her parents worked second shift we had plenty of time after school to play house. Not surprisingly we were parents at 17. We moved in together at 18 just after graduating high school and married at 19 just before I joined the army reserve and left for 9 months of training. We've been married for 41 years at this point.

Even back then I knew her sex drive was much higher than mine and mine is pretty high. Within weeks of me leaving for the army she cheated for the first time. In fairness she got drunk at a party she went to with her friend and a few frat boy types took advantage of her. I happened to call home the next day and she admitted to it and immediately broke down crying. I didn't really get anything else out of her before the call ended. 

What followed next was an unfortunate exchange of letters because we were dealing with snail mail at the time since the internet didn't exist. Her letter explained what happened. She had passed out, woke up with a guy on top of her and after realizing 4 of his friends were watching, became an active participant and let them all have a turn. She's always been a bit of an exhibitionist. 

My letter said it wasn't her fault, they took advantage of her and that I forgave her because she deserved companionship while I was away.

Unfortunately those letters crossed in the mail and before I could respond to hers she had already gone back to the house where the party was at and slept with all three of the roommates living there. They had all been involved the previous weekend. The cat was out of the bag and there wasn't much I could do about it hundreds of miles away in boot camp. So that affair continued until I got home months later. She went over there every weekend and had sex with the roommates and any of their friends that stopped by.

She stopped seeing them when I got home and was pretty much the ideal wife. Cooking, taking care of the house and pretty much begging me for sex all the time. It didn't last long though, she was cheating again with a much older coworker in less than 6 months. It honestly took me 6 more months to figure out that affair was going on because of the frequency at which we were making love. Pretty much twice daily in the morning and evening. 

When I confronted her about the affair she admitted to everything. It was quite shocking to learn that she was hooking up with him daily during their lunch break and again after work. He lived close to their office and I worked late which made that possible. She would clean up and dress for work after our morning love making and then bath again when she got home from work.

That was enough for me and we separated for almost 2 years after that. Money was pretty tight at the time, being a teen parent will tend to do that to you, so we never actually filed for divorce. During the separation I dated and slept with quite a few women. My wife's lover introduced her to cuckolding which was his fetish. So she had a very active sex life during the separation as well. He tended to share her with anyone that would let him watch.

Eventually we reconciled and agreed that going forward we would have an open marriage. At the time I probably took advantage of that situation more than she did but she still had several lovers.

In our early 30s we got into swinging. Anyone that's ever been in that lifestyle will know that for a number of reasons women tend to get more action than men. Her body count grew steadily. With exhibitionism being a big kink for her most of our visits to parties and adult clubs pretty quickly escalated to her getting gangbanged while dozens looked on.

By our early 40s I wasn't really into it anymore and quickly lost interest. She wanted to continue so our dynamic changed again and she essentially became a hotwife. That essentially made me a cuckold but we are pretty far from what that normally entails. I don't usually participate when she plays, it's not really a big turn on for me. I just have a wife with a very high sex drive and don't mind letting her get her fix.

She's had plenty of regular bulls ever since. She continued attending swinger events with many of them and those that didn't tended to be considerably younger than her.

Despite this very active sex life it's still surprising how often she masturbates. For the last ten years since she hit menopause this is usually 4 or 5 times a day. 

As a teen she had a hair brush with a large handle she often masturbated with. I consider masturbation a personal act but even back then she wasn't the least bit bashful about it. She would regularly play with that hairbrush in my presence. 

She bought her first vibrator when she was 18 when one of her girlfriends hosted a sex toy party. It wasn't much of a toy, maybe 6 inches long with a hard plastic shell which was pretty much the only thing available at the time. It didn't even vibrate all that much. It did however have a fairly broad head and then it tapered in the middle and flared back out at the end where the dial was to turn it on. Kind of the shape of a modern butt plug but not nearly as narrow where it tapered. So she could insert it and it would generally stay in place for hands free operation.

That first vibe got used a lot. She would often insert it and let it run while we watched movies or laid in bed reading. It wasn't very powerful and took a long time to get her off but she'd usually have 3 or 4 orgasms during a typical movie. 

She was crushed when it quit working and quickly bought a replacement of the same type as well as her first dildo. The dildo was made of rubber and smelled awful but was much softer and more comfortable. She had to do a lot more work to get herself off with it though, thrusting it in and out manually. It was also really entertaining watching her trying to pin it between a couple pillows so she could ride it hands free. It would be years before suction cup dildos hit the market.

Those were the toys that got her through my army training. She used them multiple times daily during the week and even on the weekends while she was having sex with multiple partners on the weekends. Again she wasn't bashful about this. She often wrote to me in great detail about using them and would take them along on the weekends and put on shows with them while the frat boys watched. They also had her insert and masturbate with empty bottles and various other household items.

During her time with the frat boys she also had anal sex for the first time. Quite a few of them were watching at the time and it really turned her on to do such a dirty thing in front of so many of them. It quickly became a regular thing that many of them did to her and she's been hooked on anal ever since. Not surprisingly she added a ribbed anal dildo to her collection which she would often insert in her back door while using her vibe in the front door. 

During our separation her toy collection grew exponentially. Her lover was taking her to a lot of the adult book and video stores that were common at the time in hopes of finding men to share her with. Both he and the other men at those stores often bought toys for her to play with since she had no qualms with using them on herself while they watched.

When we reconciled I was still bitter about her cheating and had a regular girlfriend that I was spending a lot of time with so I wasn't really sleeping with my wife much. She started masturbating several times a day at that point and for longer periods of time.

I'd often wake up in the morning and she'd be laying beside me pleasuring herself. She'd usually masturbate again as soon as she got home from work and then again before she went to sleep. That last session of the day often lasted for an hour or more and she'd often cycle through half a dozen toys while doing so. Even when I took pity on her and we had sex she'd go right back to the toys until she went to sleep. I can assure you that I always got her off on those occasions, she just enjoyed pleasuring herself that much.

She had regular lovers during that point as well and they all got the job done but that didn't diminish the amount of time she spent self pleasuring either. She had her first black lover during this point and he was considerably larger than anyone else she had been with. He was really into receiving oral pleasure from her and she became obsessed with being able to deepthroat him. She started training herself to control her gag reflex with various dildos. It actually worked and after that I'd often catch her masturbating with a dildo wedged down her throat as well.

By the time we started swinging she was still following the same schedule and pleasuring herself three times a day. It didn't matter how active we were or how many lovers she had. 

She also started having sex with a lot of other hotwives we met swinging. She purchased several strapons with realistic dildos of various sizes that she would use on the other wives and many of the ladies would reciprocate. While that really isn't masturbation I felt it was worth mentioning the extra toys that were added to her collection.  

At some point in our early 30s she purchased her first rabbit vibrator and they quickly became her favorite. With all the features designed for stimulation of multiple spots she could easily climax in less than a minute at full power. She preferred to run on lower settings and enjoy a series of smaller orgasms during her longer sessions. 

The first rabbit was huge, at least 18 inches long. Only 4 or 5 inches was actually insertable. The majority of it's length was in the handle where the D batteries that powered it were housed. It sounded like a chain saw when she turned it on. I'm not sure she even realized how loud it was. At the time my hobby workshop was in the basement of our home. It was 2 floors below the master bed room and in the opposite corner of the house. I often worked down there in the evening and could easily hear it when she fired it up to start her evening session.

I had put her through college after we reconciled and she had quickly climbed the career ladder. With increased responsibility came increased stress so the only thing that really changed during this period was that she started keeping a smaller vibe in the glove box of her car. She often used it to relieve stress during her lunch break.

At about the same time I lost interest in swinging I also sold my company and retired. My wife was offered a promotion if she would move down south where the corporate headquarters was located. We did and purchased a home in a rural wooded area.
With her increased workload she often came home exhausted and liked to soak in the tub with a glass of wine to unwind. She had several waterproof rabbits that she often took along as well so her after work sessions more often than not occurred in the bathtub.

She had always wanted a swimming pool and so we had purchased a home that had one. Because the house was in such a secluded area she quickly took to sunbathing nude in the evenings. In fact she rarely got dressed after her bath anyway. At best she'd throw on a short, silk bathrobe at times. I guess that much easy access was too much temptation for her and she regularly started masturbating while she laid out by the pool.

Around this time butt plugs were starting to be released that had decorative gems of various colors attached to them. She had quite a few of them in different colors. She was wearing a lot of finer clothes and jewelry to work in her new position and she started wearing the plugs regularly as part of her ensemble. She would generally only remove them for anal intercourse or while masturbating if she wanted to use a different toy back there and of course to use the restroom. This is a practice she has maintained to the present day.

She was often required to wear pant suits for important meetings which limited access for self pleasuring during her lunch break compared to skirts. Her solution was to purchase a butterfly vibrator with a harness that she could wear all day. It had a remote control but she would often just turn it on when she left for work and let it run all day. It wasn't as powerful as any of her rabbits but she enjoyed the stimulation and random orgasms she had through the day. There were some embarrassing moments early on when she soaked through her panties and had a wet spot appear on her suit so she started wearing panty liners to solve that problem.

Since reaching menopause her sex drive has skyrocketed. Sadly I began having problems with ED around the same time so the number of bulls she has and frequency at which she sees them have both increased. Even with them she still masturbates at the same frequency and the duration she spends doing so has also increased. I think it's even fair to say that she has gotten even more extreme while doing so.

In addition to all the larger vibes she has also purchased a pair of nipple clamps and a clit clamp that all have tiny vibrators attached to them. They seem to offer little stimulation but I often see her wearing them while she's using larger toys in all 3 holes.

Suction cup dildos have also become very big with her and I've caught her riding them all over the house. On top of the kitchen table, washing machine and living room coffee table just to name a few. As always she isn't bashful when she is caught and will just keep going until she's satisfied. She certainly isn't going to stop just because I walk in the room. She also favors these for oral play because they tend to be a little longer and the large cup on the bottom prevents her from accidently swallowing them where they might get stuck in her throat. 

Rabbits are still her favorite type of vibrator. Thankfully they've gotten much quieter as she often takes calls from her subordinates in the evenings while she's using them. I often wonder if they can hear a slight buzzing while they're on the line and what they'd think about their boss, now a VP of the company if they knew how regularly she used them.

They've also added a number of new features over the years to enhance pleasure. One of the features she likes is the thrusting vibe. Once inserted a piston drives the tip in and out to simulate real intercourse. 

Another feature she likes is an attached anal probe. She has several models with this feature. She's been regularly masturbating both vaginally and anally with 2 different toys simultaneously for years. It's rather convenient to have one toy that does both at the same time. 

The final feature she likes are those with a modern, sleek and more ergonomic design. These often feature a large head and she likes the stretch when it's first inserted after which the head serves to hold it in place for hands free operation. They also tend to feature shorter ears for more focused clitoral simulation.

These days her nightstand has three full drawers filled with toys. I'm used to seeing them plugged in charging all over the bedroom and bathroom. There always seems to be a stack of them being cleaned in the bathroom or kitchen. 

We both turned 60 earlier this year. At the time she had two regular bulls that she was seeing pretty much daily on weekdays. This did not alter the number of times she was masturbating daily.  

She would meet the first one during their lunch break. She was only having anal sex with him so her habit of always wearing butt plugs really helped to keep her stretched out and ready to go. Time was limited during their break.

The other was half her age and would call in the evenings when he was ready for a booty call. He also liked to degrade her a bit which is also a big turn on for her. She was required to always be naked in his presence. Since she rarely got dressed after bathing when she got home from work she would often just drive to his place naked. He didn't live far away and we were in a rural area so that wasn't terribly risky. 

He also liked to force her to masturbate in front of him. This was almost laughable for her but she went along with it because it seemed to really turn him on. This was just about the only time she did so without using toys.

He would generally only have sex with her once a week. The rest of the time he just demanded that she orally pleasure him. Either way he liked to finish by giving her a facial and he would kick her out as soon as he was done. She wasn't supposed to clean off the facial until she got home. Being used and discarded like that was a big turn on for her especially if they didn't have intercourse. She would rush home and start her bed time masturbation session immediately, oftentimes not bothering to clean up her face before beginning. It was almost comical to see her so frantic.

Several months after her birthday she started seeing a third bull on weekends. He is black and likes sharing her with his friends. As a result she is now having sex with 3 or 4 different men on the weekend and often multiple times.

Even sleeping with that many partners on a regular basis hasn't satisfied her libido. She still masturbates daily with the same frequency. Given the active (and satisfying) sex life she's always had I can't explain why she feels the need to self pleasure as much as she does. I gave up on trying to figure that out years ago and just let her do her thing. Happy wife, happy life.

You have bought coffee at your local coffee shop and the barista asks if you like it with milk. You reply “yes” and by the are presented with three options: cow milk, oat milk and almond milk. 

You first reply “cow milk, those others aren’t even real milk” The barista replies “True, they are more like juices camouflaging as milk.” He then adds “To get the cow milk we will need to impregnate a cow by insemination of bull sperm, then take her baby away so we can use the milk she would have produced for her baby to be used in your coffee instead, that cool with you?” 

For some weird reason it would take the same time to produce the milk for your coffee regardless of option.

I think most people in this scenario would just go with the oat or almond milk, yet most of us don’t when we are in the store or coffee shop, why? 

There could be a similar dilemma at a burger place where they’d need to kill a cow, or they could just use the plant based option which might be slightly less tasty but then no sentient being would need to be killed.

Seems to me like the moral failure of our time.

[https://trekmovie.com/2025/07/18/jonathan-del-arcos-delightful-childrens-book-shows-his-journey-from-uruguay-to-the-borg/](https://trekmovie.com/2025/07/18/jonathan-del-arcos-delightful-childrens-book-shows-his-journey-from-uruguay-to-the-borg/)

*Freddy the Alien* , written by Jonathan Del Arco and Trisha DiFazio and illustrated by Adria Alvarado (whose credits include Star Trek Online), tells the story of a young boy from Uruguay (Del Arco’s country of birth) who moves to New York City—in winter, no less—and struggles to fit in. Bullies make fun of him, it’s much colder than he’s used to, and he felt like an outcast… an alien.

Beautifully illustrated and told playfully in English interspersed with Spanish phrases, the story captures the feelings any kid has who feels like an outsider, especially one who’s been uprooted from everything they know, as well as any kid who’s struggled with being different.

https://preview.redd.it/mmi5jqy99tdf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0c4cf2761bedd405a8e30778e86e843828b9a89

Del Arco told us how the book came about:

>“I had written several versions of the story first as a pilot, then as a film, and finally, I had developed it as an animated series with the Rick and Morty team, but none of them came to pass. About two years ago, I was in Vegas with my friend Trisha and she said, ‘Hey, let’s get a coffee. I wanna talk to you about your pilot’ and suggested the story would really resonate with kids as a storybook and that we should write it together, and I said ‘Well why not!'”

He told us that writing the book has been a “labor of love” based on his own immigration experience and his road to joining Star Trek, “written to help kids feel seen when they feel like they don’t belong.”

At the end of the book (spoiler alert!), young Freddy finds happiness in acting and even gets “famous as an alien on TV.” While the illustration isn’t specifically a Borg, it’s definitely a nod to the character that has endeared Del Arco to Star Trek fans. When asked how the book connects to the Star Trek ethos, Del Arco told us:

>“I am the Trek ethos!  lol.  Seriously, though, my life experiences align very much with the values of Star Trek, so I didn’t really have to put a specific effort into guiding the story toward Trek territory, it just was from the beginning. The fact that I get to share it with like-minded Trek fans is really the joy of it!”

\[...\]

**Book launch at STLV, plus a dance party with Jeri Ryan**

If you’re going to Star Trek Las Vegas in August, Del Arco and his co-author Trisha will be doing a number of events there; at one, they’ll be joined by Jeri Ryan, who is working with Del Arco on a project he calls “a little something” for their iconic characters to do together.

**Thursday, August 7** : Jonathan Del Arco and Trisha DiFazio will be in The Lounge for a Q&A and book signing, along with a selfie spot for the fans who buy the book to take photos with the character.

**Friday, August 8** : Del Arco and DiFanzio will be signing books and photos all day, and at 6:30 PM that evening, Del Arco is hosting an ’80s-themed Freddy the Alien Prom Dance Party with special guest Jeri Ryan and other celebrities. Come dressed as an 80s alien!

1m3t78d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3t78d,Behind the buzz of Wrocław Rynek...,"Pawła Włodkowica Street is where Wrocław exhibits a slower, deeper character. The leafy promenade along the Fosa Miejska, once a defensive moat and the site of a tragic 18th-century explosion wiping out half the street, is a great spot to peek into the city's Jewish heritage. 

Those city defence walls, prominent until Prussian times, were dismantled by Napoleon's raiding army at the beginning of the 19th century. And made way for the stunning leafy boulevard (bulwar).

It often gets skipped by tourists, but this entire bulwar arch along Podwale Street is where stories from Prussian times, when the city was called Breslau, come alive. It's the Jewish district of Wrocław where people of four different faiths used to coexist.

What to expect here? Post-war rebuilds, secessionist façades, Kino Nowe Horyzonty—the city’s largest arthouse cinema and a proud flag bearer of Wrocław's artistic pulse, the National Forum of Music, one of Poland’s most impressive - White Stork Synagogue with its courtyard from pre-war Breslau; the district courthouse; and the art-splashed walls near Mleczarnia. This is where time slows down and history lingers. 

PURO Hotel and Bułka z Masłem bring stunning green outdoor spaces, and locals love hanging out in the leafy promenade area. Grabbing an ice cream or sipping coffee under chestnut trees, few realise they’re sitting atop layers of vanished cemeteries, former libraries, and the beating pulse of Wrocław.

Bascially, it's a fruit with a single pit and a fleshy exterior. Avocados apparently aren't drupes, and I tried to look up why but the [words made my head hurt](http://ucavo.ucr.edu/General/FruitBerry.html). What does qualify are: plums, nectarines, peaches, apricots, cherries, and all those crazy hybrids thereof. Even almonds, mangoes, coffee, and olives, while not part of those Latin words from before, technically qualify as drupes.

This gives you a pretty decent sandbox that lends well to either sweet or savory applications. You can definitely go savory with something like [coffee-braised short rib with mango salsa](http://www.foodchannel.com/recipes/recipe/short-rib-taquito-mango-margarita-salsa/). If mole-inspired dishes are too ludicrously complicated for you, you can go with a simple [plum sauce](http://www.ourbestbites.com/2012/08/roasted-pork-tenderloin-with-plum-sauce/) that goes with pretty much anything.

Someone requested Ottoman on the last one of these, AND that request was the most upvoted one, so I thought I'd post some Ottoman stuff for people to discuss, but I have a few DISCLAIMERS:

* This is from a video I recorded for myself on my first round of access. MANY OF THESE THINGS MAY HAVE CHANGED, as that version is now several months old.
* I'm neither a dev nor a part of the community team. My understanding is that I can talk about my first round of access, just not show footage or screens, but this is NOT a solicitation for feedback on Ottoman's bonuses by PDX (just trying to give you guys something to talk about). If they were to produce a list, it would likely be more finalized, and if they wanted granular feedback on bonuses, they'd post more of them.

These are Ottoman's advances, and do not include Muslim religion, nor Turkish culture bonuses (I don't know all these). I might post more nations if people are interested, but I won't post any that have not already been covered by Tinto Flavour, as I don't want to step on the devs' toes.

I find our that there's a whole sub about this experience? 
Including toilet maces? How is that so common? 

Sometimes I have very random dreams but at some point I decide that I have to return to THAT mall and find the coffee place. 
And the mall is always the same as well, I can exactly tell which shops are at which level. The coffee place, however, is always at the top level.

Those dreams are always so hyper realistic, the people in there as well. It sounds so weird but I sometimes feel some weird kind of ""homesickness"" thinking of these places. Or some feeling of incompleteness , a certain ""I wasn't done there"" feeling.

Sorry, just flabbergasted right here.",8,1752921311.0,TheMallWorld,2,0.91,False

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and Ark ASA. Just bought Palworld too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

1m3sy9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1m3sy9h/f4m_spy_plot/,[ F4M] spy plot.,"

20:04; 06/09/2023; Ankara, Turkey. 

*Aryan and Meena both were RAW agents working in Turkey together for a data collecting mission. Aryan was the mission leader and Meena was an intel provider for him. Aryan and Meena were sitting outside in an open cafe keeping their eyes on the target which was right in front of them. Hotel GreenWorld.*

Aryan: “Well, We're fucked. Really really badly. It's a woman.” *He wears his earpiece and pulls out his morse code device.*

Meena: *She takes a peek at the woman in the red dress going into the restaurant.* “What?? You're sitting in front of one. Half of this planet is woman. Even the abomination called Cold Brew you're drinking is made by a woman. Then why can't a woman be an informer to our enemies?”

Aryan: “Hey…  are you stupid or on your periods?? She's a woman. Our plan was that we know they'll go into the bathroom for the information Exchange. And my plan was to steal the USB from them and leave. Now there's a woman and I can't go into the women's bathroom now.” *He uses his morse device to send a Mission abort request but he was stopped midway by Meena.*

Meena: “Haha…  darling. Don't fucking make that Period joke. That's sexiest and I'm going to cut off your dick again if I hear that. Understood?? Now Don't worry. I'm a woman. And I'll go and steal that drive. So put your coder down and trust in me. You're not the only spy here. I'm too. And I'm a better spy than you.” *Meena now stared at Aryan as she took the coder from his hands.*

Aryan: “Hey… Give me that back. I have to tell the intel department that she's a woman. And, you really think it's that easy?? You just go in there and come out with her stuff?? You're half the size of that woman & and this is your first mission. I'm more experienced and I'll decide.”

Meena: “Ohh.. Now I have to do it. You… you're really a narcissist. You think I can't do that because I'm a woman???
You know this is the problem with you and this department.""

Meena: You guys think women are liabilities you have to keep safe. And that's why your first mission was in Afghanistan and mine is in this dumbfuck land of Turkey. And don't forget we're pretending to be a couple for this mission. So now fucking smile,  I'm going into that restaurant. And I'll come back with that necklace. If I don't consider myself dead and be a male widow.” *Meena left and all Aryan could do was to stare at this form, she was never this angry during his teasing. But now she was in walking death for him.*

*After an hour she comes back. With a USB in her hands she waves at Aryan from a distance. He was getting more worried and gestured to her to come with him before that woman or her companions came to find us. After leaving that place both went to their room and plugged in the USB. And the videos of Drug Trade, Human Trafficking & Weapons Smuggling were clearly identified. Afterwards Aryan announced this to RAW headquarters and gave them all the intel regarding the incident and then the RAW person asked for Meena to talk to.*

RawS: “Hello Ms. Meena.   As we all know, your findings in this investigation by you two has given us many positives . We suspect these Turkish drones are being smuggled to Pakistan and these are kurds being trafficked. Now these concepts are really dangerous. And a woman working in foreign country as a spy on these things is not always a good idea. We are ready to send in the male equivalent of you. But this ultimate decision is in Aryan’s hands. You two can contact us when the decision is made.”

*The Chief hangs the phone. And now Aryan handed Meena a black coffee and came to the bed.*

Aryan: “You're a really good agent, Meena. You really did a lot of good things in this mission. But sorry because I don't think we'll be safe now. So I prefer that a man is standing behind me during a fight. Yet… if you want I'll let you be with me on this mission but the choice is yours. So choose wisely.”

-i cleaned the steam wand yesterday using the tool the company gives. Today lots water came out of the wand, along with a bit of steam. Furthermore the steam lights started flashing in a way I can’t find an explanation for.

I de-scaled and ran 2 clean cycles after coming across these issues, but still running into problems. Additionally, the machine is leaking a lot of water from under, and I’ve noticed steam coming out from the machine while I use it.
