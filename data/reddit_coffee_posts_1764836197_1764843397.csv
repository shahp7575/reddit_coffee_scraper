1pdwerq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pdwerq/two_weeks_into_breakup/,Two weeks into breakup,"Hey everyone

It’s been two weeks since my boyfriend left me of 5 years. We were growing apart slowly, didn’t talk as much, lack of intimacy and just kept arguing but he was my world

We had an argument in London that was as a result of me having an autistic burnout which was my first and was so scary but he didn’t support me through it, I only got diagnosed with autism this year. 

He is avoidance and when I’m struggling he just sits in silence on his phone. 

I got home from work two weeks ago and he had packed ready to go and just left me without a clear explanation and looking back I can see the relationship was falling apart, but it was only me trying to keep it going and after the weekend he distanced himself and wouldn’t talk then on the Friday it was over. 

Coming to terms with everything has been pure hell, it’s been two weeks and I’m still not eating, struggling to look after the dog we shared and I’m still off work. I’ve left a voice clip begging to meet for a coffee, to talk it through. Surely after 5 years we can work it out but he just blanks me. 

We work together occasionally which is awful. 

I just can’t see a way forward and the days aren’t getting easier. I did my first food shop yesterday and it was pitiful, the Christmas music was blaring over the speakers and I just cried. 

I had paid for a cruise for next year, we were going skiing, we were also going to see his parents in New Zealand. 

I don’t think there’s anything anyone can do, I’ve started therapy and I’m still managing to walk the dog daily. It’s just I’m running on an empty tank. I always wake up crying and feeling very alone

How the hell am I going to get through Christmas? My friends circle is tiny and my family is small too - he’s living with a shared friend for now but chose that than staying with me in my house. He must have been so unhappy but never spoke to me. 

Thanks for any words of wisdom or reassurance. 

Just trying to hold on which sounds pathetic but it’s true

first thing: stop comparing your prep to people doing full time dedicated. your situation is different. accept it and build around it instead of spiraling that you're behind. Make your study kit light. one laptop, one tablet, headphones, one notebook. i couldn't lug around ten pounds of materials between airbnbs in three cities. the lighter i kept things, the more likely i actually opened them to study in random places like airports and coffee shops. pick your pre-test rotation carefully. i chose a lighter outpatient rotation right before my exam date. couldn't do full time dedicated during a brutal surgical rotation. i could do questions during lunch breaks, wasn't post call every fourth night ruining my sleep. that mattered way more than people realize.
location changes kept me from burning out completely. new city means new coffee shops means the novelty kept my brain from melting. same library for weeks straight would have destroyed me. switching every few days actually helped. also let go of perfect studying conditions. some days quiet library, other days loud coffee shop, sometimes my car in the parking garage during a break. the content matters way more than the ambiance. just get it done. i also just told my preceptors i had a board exam coming up. some didn't care but a few did. one lightened my last week. another let me leave early a couple days for full lengths. people will help if you ask.
planning was literally essential. i used an ai planner to map my studying around my travel dates and rotation schedule. inputted flight times, clinic hours, all of it. showed me realistic study windows. some days it was just ten questions on phone during commute. not glamorous but i knew exactly what was possible. then i focused on uworld blocks (timed, mixed), wrongs review, two to three ccs cases per week, and one weak topic per week based on practice trends. that was it. no extras, no side hustles with other resources.
honestly the away rotations helped my studying. was seeing real patients, understanding context better, and later that stuff showed up on practice exams. made everything feel less abstract. if you're in away rotation plus board prep, your prep will look different and that's okay. keep materials light. schedule realistic windows. be honest with preceptors. you don't need perfect conditions. you just need consistency.",1,1764843058.0,Step2,0,1.0,False

Three days before the wedding, I went to try on my gown. It was a white dress with an elaborate design with lots of laces and tulle on the skirt. As the seamstress pinned the sides and adjusted the length, I looked in the mirror and felt excited. I wanted to show it to Craig, and see his face light up when he saw it. There was nothing I didn’t share with him.

Lucy, my stepmother, looked me over and smiled thinly. “You look good, Bella,” she said quietly.

“Thanks mom!” I replied. “Can I show this to Craig?”

She shook her head. “No, we follow the rules. It's a bad omen for the bride and groom to meet so close to the wedding.”

“Please mom,” I whined. “I won’t show it on me. Just the dress in the box. He’ll be so happy. It’s only bad to meet the day before,” I added. “Not three days before.”

“It’s bad,” she said firmly. “You will see him at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow with everyone. And that’s it!”

I didn’t want to argue because Lucy was pretty stubborn usually. I sighed and nodded. “Okay…”

But the excitement stayed with me. It felt like bubbles in my chest. After the fitting, I held the garment bag and thought about Craig’s smile. I told myself I would be quick. I would show him the dress, still in the bag, then come right back fast. Lucy wouldn’t even come to know.

I fell for Craig when I was a sophomore in college. He was a senior. He helped me carry books on a rainy day and walked me to the parking lot. We started texting, then going for coffee. He asked about my classes and remembered small things. I liked that, and over time I started to love him.

After college, he kept seeing me. We met each other’s families. My father, Jared Williams, ran a fashion house, so there were events and shows. Craig came with me, smiled for photos, and held my hand. He was the only heir of his parents with two hotels.

The night he proposed, we were on the terrace of his parents’ hotel. There were lights and music. He went down on one knee with a ring. I was so thrilled that I said yes right away. We fixed a wedding date with our families. We booked the hall, picked flowers, and chose the cake. I kept a list for everything, doing things personally even though my father had a fleet of personnel to work for me.

As soon as Lucy left our wedding boutique, I snuck out. I put the gown in my car and drove to Craig’s apartment. I had a key he gave me months ago. He had said, “Use it when you want to surprise me.” I smiled at the memory. The building had a private elevator. I rode up and stepped into his foyer.

The living room was quiet. I set the garment bag on the sofa and called out softly, “Craig?” There was no answer. His shoes were by the door, and his jacket was on a chair. He had to be home.

I walked down the hall toward the bedroom. As I got closer, I saw a trail of clothes on the floor. A red lace top, a silk skirt, bra and panties, and a pair of heels tipped on their sides. I stopped and blinked. It looked like someone undressed in a hurry. I smiled to myself. “Must be Evan,” I whispered. Craig’s younger cousin liked to drop by without warning with a date. I rolled my eyes and decided to leave. I picked up the garment bag and turned to go when I heard a soft sound. It was a low breathy moan from Craig’s bedroom. Feeling embarrassed, I increased my pace. But froze the next moment when a man’s voice came through the door, rough and loud. “Mayaaaa!”

Shock rippled through me and I stopped moving. Was that Craig’s voice? No, God, no. My first thought was that I misheard. My stepsister, Maya, hadn’t come back to the city in four years. She never showed her face to us even once ever since she left after that fight. I turned over my shoulder to look at the half-closed bedroom door. Despite myself, I turned back. I reached and saw that the door was slightly open. The room was dim, but I could see enough.

Craig was in bed with a woman. Her long brown hair fell across the pillow. He was holding her, naked, and moving inside her. He said her name again, “Oh, Maya!”

Everything in me went quiet as my mind numbed in shock. I stood there for a few seconds, my hands turning clammy, my heart thundering. Craig and Maya together? When did this happen? I had read about this happening in books. You know, just fiction. But this cliché happened in real life as well?

The world tilted so fast I felt dizzy. I slapped my hand on my mouth to stop the sound of my gasp. My mind clicked through little details when I turned around. I noticed a glass of water on the nightstand was half full. There was a smudge of lipstick on the rim. There was a small backpack in the corner with a labubu doll, which was Maya’s. I stepped back, the hallway suddenly too long, the air too thin. I couldn’t breathe.

Unable to process the shock, I turned and went back to the living room. I picked up the garment bag with both hands, opened the door, and walked out.

Inside the elevator, I looked at the reflection of my 23 year old self. Through my pale face, my green eyes stared at me, my blond hair sticking to my face, which was covered with sweat. It was then that I broke down. A sob tore from me making my body shudder. The betrayal was too much to bear. But anger also surged through me, and suddenly I wanted to confront them. How could they do this to me?

So without thinking twice, I went back to his apartment to confront them.

A Video
Bella

I stood in the hallway and tried to breathe, wondering what I was doing? Should I go in? My confidence wavered.

But I wanted to open the door and shout at them, make them face me. I wanted to ask why, since when, and how could they betray me. I wanted to look at Maya and say, “You stole my fiancé.”

My steps faltered because I also knew how Maya was. She would deny everything in front of our father. She would say I was jealous and that I was lying. Just like last time. She would cry like she had done before. Just before leaving home, she played a victim card, making me look like the villain of her life.

But I wanted to ask Craig if any of the last five years meant anything. Gathering courage and wiping my tears, I walked into the apartment.

Just as I reached outside the bedroom, I heard Maya’s soft and smug voice. She said, “You’ve kept it a secret for four years. I’m so proud of you, Craig. You’re awesome! I only wanted to finish college and then marry you. I couldn’t bear to see my stepsister have your kids.”

Craig laughed. “Bella’s a moron,” he said. “She’s so blind in love with me she never notices anything. It was easy to manipulate her.”

Manipulate me? I stood still and held my breath, my tears silently slipping from my eyes once again.

Maya chuckled and spoke again in a sultry voice, “I’m waiting for your divorce. Then we can start our own business. I’ve been dreaming about it for so long!”

Craig sounded pleased. “Of course, love. I’ll divorce Bella in a month. After the wedding, she gets her twenty-million inheritance. And if she divorces within six months, the money goes to her husband. That’s what her grandfather wrote in his will. So, it will all come to us, baby. I only have to tolerate her for a month more.”

I pressed my palm to the wall because I felt like I might fall. My heart pounded in my ears. I knew about my inheritance. Everyone in the family knew that I would get it after marriage and lose it if I divorced within six months.

Maya chuckled. “You're smart, Craig Jones. Gosh, I hate seeing her face. She walks around the house like she owns everything. The bitch doesn’t know how fast her world is going to crumble. Then I will exact my revenge. After she loses her inheritance, her father will remove her from his will also,” she snickered.

Craig laughed hard. “You’re wicked, Maya. Just be patient for a few more weeks, baby. Then we will have it all!”

They had planned my downfall carefully for so long. If I confronted them, it would be the most foolish thing to do.

“Come, ride me, baby!” Craig said. “Let’s celebrate!”

Anger inside me erupted like a volcano. Celebrate my downfall? I wanted to teach them a lesson now. So I took out my phone, and started recording them. If I sent this video to my father, I was sure he would call off the marriage.

“Oh baby, you’re so good!” Craig said as Maya moved on him.

My hand shook so hard in anger that a few seconds later, my phone slipped down. Craig snapped his head toward me. “Bella!” he gasped, his eyes going wide.

Maya also turned sharply to see me, and her mouth dropped open. “Shit!”

I picked up the phone and rushed out.

Craig removed Maya from him and came after me. “Bella, Bella!”

“I don’t want to hear a thing from you!” I shouted, as I scrambled to send the video to Daddy.

“Stop!” he shouted. “Don’t!”

I opened the door. “You both deserve to be exposed!”

“Stop this bullshit, Bella!” he roared. “No one will marry you except me! Your marriage with me is written in stone!”

“I’d rather die than marry you, cheater!” I shouted back through my tears. I pressed the button to send the video to my father.

Craig came after me. But I was out of the door by then. He stood naked on the door of his apartment, watching me leave. “Bellaaaa!” he roared. A few people came out of their apartments hearing the commotion. Good. They would see him naked, dripping in her juices.

I left the apartment building as fast as I could, and went to my car. On the road, the city lights blurred a little. I blinked, trying to clear my vision. My mind played back the words I had just heard. ‘It was a secret for five years’. ‘Divorce in a month’. ‘Twenty million inheritance gone’. ‘Tolerate her for a month more’. ‘I rubbed my chest as the betrayal hurt deep’.

I gripped the steering wheel. I thought about Lucy and her firmly denying me to meet Craig. Did she know? Was she helping them keep me away so I would not see anything? So that their plan was executed smoothly?

Then I thought about my father. If I called him now and told him what I saw, what I heard, would he believe me? No, he wouldn’t. That’s why I sent the video proof. He loved me, but he thought I was an “entitled brat.”

If I hadn’t recorded them in the act, Maya would lie through her teeth in front of him just to get the money. I didn’t trust Craig either. He would rather watch me suffer and make the marriage more miserable.

I remembered how four years ago, after high school, Maya left the house after a fight. She told everyone I was the reason. The house was full of tension for weeks. My father chose to calm Lucy and Maya instead of me. But despite his efforts, Maya left never to return. Since then, Daddy treated me like I might start another problem at any moment. He watched me like I was a risk to manage. He scolded me often because of Maya.

I remembered that fight like it happened yesterday. Maya had cried so much that day, her sobs filled every corner of the house. She stood in front of my father and her mother, acting like she was the victim. She said she would always be a stepsister and that I could never accept her. Then, with a trembling voice, she offered to leave the house so I could live “comfortably.” Lucy’s eyes had filled with tears, but she didn’t protest. She only lowered her head and suffered quietly, as if Maya’s sacrifice was breaking her heart.

But the truth was different. The fight started because on the last day of our school, I had caught Maya with Luke. I had confessed to her a week before that I liked Luke.

I had seen her sitting close to him, cuddling him, kissing him on his lips. When I confronted her later, she smiled in a way she wasn’t ashamed. On the contrary, she flaunted her “victory”. “He never liked you!” she had said, flicking her hair.

The betrayal from Luke was nothing compared to the one from Maya. “You can have him,” I replied.

I stifled my feelings for Luke right after so that Maya could be with him. But I don’t know why Maya came home and created the drama, accusing me of just the opposite? She told our parents that it was me who kissed her boyfriend, Luke, and I hated her for being happy. My father believed her and scolded me to be more adjusting. But Maya left for college nonetheless, trapping me into guilt all this while.

It was during that painful time that Craig, Luke’s friend, stepped in. He comforted me, chased after me, and slowly, I fell in love with him. But now Maya had her claws in Craig as well. It was like she wanted to snatch everything I cherished.

You'll Be Safe
Bella

I didn’t know where to go after leaving Craig’s apartment. My chest still hurt deep from the betrayal, and my thoughts kept circling the same question—how could Maya do this to me again?

Before I knew it, I was parking in front of the Phoenix Mall, the largest and grandest mall in the city. It had chains across the world, and I had heard that its CEO, Scott Moore, was a secretive sharp billionaire bachelor. He was arrogant, and cold, more handsome than God, and had hundreds of girls swooning over him.

I wandered through the bright halls of the mall and walked into a quiet café. The smell of coffee and baked bread wafted in the air. I ordered a cappuccino and sat at a small table by the window. The moment the cup was in my hands, tears started to fall again. I tried to wipe them quickly, but they kept coming. I cried quietly, hoping no one noticed. I couldn’t believe my life had come to this. How was I supposed to stop a marriage my whole family had already planned? Would my father believe the video content? I wondered if I should make the video viral.

Just as I lowered my head to sip my coffee, the door opened, and two men walked in. My heart skipped. It was Luke and Mark, Craig’s friends. Luke was the same boy who I liked in high school before Maya destroyed it all. I quickly bent my head lower, hoping they wouldn’t notice me. They sat two tables behind me, talking and laughing. I couldn’t help but overhear them.

“Bella has always been a moron,” Luke chuckled, stirring his coffee. “She never noticed Craig and Maya were in love. Stupid blind brat. Maya is back in town and she'll be staying with me for a while.”

Mark laughed loudly. “But it works for us, Luke. Craig smartly handled Bella after you goofed up with her. Once he gets Bella’s inheritance, we’re set. Our contracts with him are already drafted. The moment the money comes, we’ll sign. Our businesses will finally take off. Only a month before final goodbye to the bitch!” They both laughed again.

My blood went cold. I clutched my cup so tightly I thought it might break. Their words sank in slowly but clearly. They were all in on it. Craig, Maya, Luke, and Mark. They weren’t just betraying me with love. They were plotting around my inheritance. My stomach twisted, bitterness coating my soul. This all was happening behind my back ever since high school, and like a fool, I never came to know. How gullible I was?

Anger burned in my chest. I wanted to go to their table and confront them, scream that I had come to know it all. On an impulse, I pushed my chair back and stood up quickly. But the moment I turned, I collided with someone. Arms gripped me instantly to stop me from falling.

I craned my neck up, and for a moment, I forgot how to breathe. A beautiful man, towering over me with broad shoulders, filled the space. He was wearing a pinstripe suit. His face was striking with a sharp jawline, high cheekbones, and dark eyes so intense they seemed to glow. His lips were firm and bow-shaped, his nose straight, his black hair falling just slightly across his forehead. He looked unreal, like a man who didn’t belong to this world. Like a king who ruled the world.

I noticed that there was complete silence in the café now. In that instant, an idea lit up in my mind. A reckless, desperate plan that could actually break the marriage.

I tilted my head slightly, giving Luke and Mark a sidelong glance, then turned back to the man. Without giving myself time to think, I pressed my lips against his.

He growled low in his throat as his hand shot out and grabbed me by the waist, pulling me close. It was protective, possessive, and startling all at once. My body went stiff in his arms, but from the corner of my eyes, I saw Luke and Mark watching us. Their mouths had fallen open. Everyone in the café had turned to stare.

The kiss was quick at first, just enough for everyone to see. I whispered against his lips, “Please, could you keep up the act for a minute?”

To my surprise, he didn’t push me away. Instead, his hand tightened on my waist, and he kissed me back. His lips were warm and commanding. He deepened the kiss, and the world around me blurred. His kiss was passionate, strong, almost overwhelming. For a moment, I forgot why I even started it. I felt my knees weaken, and I had to hold on to his shirt to stay steady.

When we finally broke apart, the café was completely silent. My lips tingled, my cheeks burned, and I couldn’t get a hold of myself. Like my whole body was on fire. 

But I knew Luke and Mark had seen everything. Now they would inform Craig or my father about it. So if the video didn’t work, this would.

“Could you please walk out with me from the café?” I asked softly. “I want them to see it clearly,” I said, darting my eyes to Luke and Mark.

“Do you want me to make them disappear from the face of the earth?” he asked seriously, his intense eyes locked on mine.

My mouth dropped. Was he a mafia boss? I let out a nervous chuckle. “N-no!”

Without waiting, he grabbed my wrist and walked with me toward the door. I glanced back. Luke and Mark had jumped up, chasing us. Panic rushed through me. I pulled closer to the man and whispered urgently, “Please, help me. Hide me for a few hours. I want to escape them.” Now I was afraid that they would confront me and manhandle me.

His dark eyes cut to me. “You shouldn’t trust strangers,” he said in a low and rough voice.

I faltered, my lips parting. I didn’t know what to say. I felt foolish and desperate. But then his eyes softened. “But I’ll save you,” he said.

Something in me believed him instantly. I couldn’t explain why. It was pure instinct.

He led me quickly to a side hallway I hadn’t even noticed before. At the end was a private elevator, hidden behind mirrored doors. He pressed his palm to a panel, and the doors opened silently. I glanced behind. Luke and Mark were still chasing, and they were closing in.

The man pulled me inside with him, still holding my wrist. The doors closed, shutting out the noise, and shutting out everything. My heart pounded in my chest as the elevator began to rise.

“Where are we going?” I whispered, half afraid of the answer.

He turned his head slightly, his eyes burning into mine. “To my penthouse,” he said. “You’ll be safe there.”

Somehow, even with everything I had been through that day, I believed him. Maybe I had a natural penchant for falling into wrong hands.

Mate
Scott

For centuries, the Lycans had ruled the werewolf race. They were stronger, faster, and nearly immortal, and were born kings. But time had not been kind. Wars, disease, and betrayal had cut their numbers until only I remained. I was the last Lycan alive, and I was the last Lycan king of the werewolves. At 28, the weight of my kind rested on my shoulders.

In order to survive, we moved into human cities and learned to live among them, blending into their world because we had no choice. We worked like them, dressed like them, and hid our true selves. To the humans, I was only Scott Moore, the young billionaire who owned the chain of Phoenix Malls and countless other businesses. If our true identities were discovered, it would mean the end of us.

Every year, Lycans went into a frenzy to rut for a week in order to mate. And it was that time of the year for me. I wanted to fuck every she-wolf or human I came in contact with, but I was restraining myself. I took heavy medication to stop my desires and lust.

And the Elders never let me forget my duty especially during this time. They said it was time I took a mate and produced heirs. They told me every day that my bloodline was too important to end with me, and that without me the werewolves would die out. It was me who gave them the power to exist. They wanted me to continue the Lycan line. But they didn’t understand the risk. Being a Lycan was different from being a normal werewolf. My power was stronger, heavier. If a female she-wolf carried my pup, she might not survive the birth.

Still, the Elders pushed me. “There are plenty of willing she-wolves,” they said. “They would give their lives for you.” They called it sacrifice. I called it madness. I wasn’t going to kill someone just to satisfy their demand. So I refused, again and again. I didn’t want an heir if it meant killing someone to get it.

This discussion again took place in the early morning meeting today. I pinched the bridge of my nose as I listened to them, waiting impatiently to get out of the meeting. As soon as it was done, I walked out of the room, and went for a swim to spend my energy and calm my anger and lust. I had an important meeting with human shareholders to attend next.

Thirty minutes later, I reached that meeting with my Beta, Troy. Troy explained a new plan to the shareholders about dividends. I sat at the head of the table, listening intently, when suddenly a scent hit me. It was that of sweet and warm chocolate and cinnamon. The smell was so strong it shook me. My Lycan stirred instantly. How could a chocolate cake smell so good? My throat went dry and my chest tightened. I couldn’t help the urge to eat it right away.

I tried to sit still, but the craving grew stronger with every second. My hands clenched on the table. What the hell was happening with me? The smell was pulling me like a chain.

I pushed back my chair and stood abruptly. Without a word, I left the meeting. Troy scrambled to follow. “Scott, what’s going on?” he asked as every shareholder looked at me with surprise.

I didn’t answer as I strode out of the meeting. The mouthwatering scent filled my lungs, guiding me through the corridors of Phoenix Mall. My Lycan was in full control now. I felt like a predator on the hunt. And that too for a chocolate and cinnamon cake? I loved dark chocolates, but this? My reaction was strange.

The trail led me to a quiet café. The smell was strong here. I opened the door and walked to the counter, scanning the cakes that got me so distracted. The girl behind the counter flustered, and blushed. It was a normal reaction of humans when they saw me. I continued to scan the cakes, and that’s when I heard a soft sniffle. I snapped my head in that direction.

A human girl sat at a table near the window. Her head was bent, her shoulders small and tense. She was crying quietly, her hand moving to her face again and again to wipe her tears. Before I knew it, my feet carried me in that direction, the smell growing stronger, coiling around my neck like a noose.

My Lycan growled one word that shook me to my core. MATE. The urge to rut surged like waves in a storm-tossed sea. ‘Mark her. Claim her. Rut her.’

I froze. My heart hammered in my chest hard. How was this possible? She was human. That couldn’t be right. The Moon Goddess wouldn’t bind me to a human. Yet every cell in my body knew it was true. She was mine. Mine to claim. And I wanted her madly, badly. She would never be able to carry my pups. But who cared?

I stared at her. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. She was soft, timid, and fragile-looking. She had disheveled blond hair, framing an innocent face, and eyes so emerald green they shone through her tears. My fingers twitched to feel the curves beneath her pink dress.

My Lycan was howling in joy, desire stirring inside him. ‘Take her. Rut her.’

I started moving toward her, my primal nature surging forth. Then, just as I got close, she stood up quickly, turned to the side and bumped into me.

Her small body collided with mine, and my arms reacted on their own. I caught her against me, holding her firmly against my chest. The shock of her touch was like electricity sparking through my body. My Lycan roared with triumph. ‘Mark her.’

She looked up at me, her eyes wide. For a second, we just stared at each other. My world tilted on its axis and then started rotating at a dizzying speed.

She glanced over my shoulder. I turned slightly and saw two men watching her. They were sitting a few tables away, staring in shock. My Lycan’s rage flared at once. Whoever they were, they had made her cry. For that alone, I wanted them dead.

Before I could do anything, she grabbed my shirt and kissed me, shocking the hell out of me. I froze. Then I felt her soft lips against mine, desperate and trembling, and everything inside me snapped. I never wanted the kiss to end.

I hated it when she pulled away. She whispered quickly against my lips. “Please, bear with me. Keep up the act for a minute.”

She thought this was an act? She had no idea what I was going through. But I saw the fear in her eyes, the desperation. I nodded. I would play along, for now.

‘No. Mark her. Rut her.’

Her enemies were still watching. My anger burned hot. So I kissed her back possessively, pulling her closer. The taste of her, the warmth of her mouth, the way her hands clutched at me. It all set me on fire, addling my mind. My Lycan howled in pure joy. ‘Ours.’

After our kiss, I led her out of the café, keeping her close. People stared, but no one said a word. Through the mind link, I called Troy. ‘Some men are chasing me. If they try to follow me, stop them. If they resist, kill them.’

‘Yes, Alpha,’ Troy replied instantly, sounding worried. ‘But where are you? You vanished faster than smoke.’

I gritted my teeth. ‘Near Moon Cafe.’

I didn’t slow down and pulled her with me toward the private elevators only I had access to. She didn’t fight me. Her steps matched mine, small and quick. I felt the trembling in her hand, and I squeezed them softly.

The doors slid open, and I guided her inside my penthouse. She looked up at me like a little lamb, unbeknownst that she had walked into a wolf’s den.

“You’re safe now,” I said reassuringly. “No one can reach you here.”

The doors closed behind us, shutting out the world. For the first time in a long time, I felt calm, satisfied, and grounded. Like I had found what I’d been waiting for all my life. My beautiful mate. In my home.

And I wasn’t going to let her go because I was going to announce her to the Elders tomorrow.

You Are Divine
Bella

The elevator opened into a quiet, beautiful penthouse. I didn’t look around much. I went straight to the first couch I saw and sat down. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Tears came again. I tried to wipe them away, but they wouldn’t stop. I didn’t want to show myself as a damsel in distress to a stranger. But what could I do? My chest hurt so much, the betrayal being fresh.

He stood a few steps away, watching me. “Do you want something?” he asked softly, carefully.

I shook my head. “I-I’ll just leave in some time. Th-thanks for helping me.”

He walked to a bar cabinet and came back with a glass of wine. When I didn’t take it, he crouched in front of me, and set it on the table in front of me. In a low voice, he stared into my eyes and said, “Drink. It will calm you.”

I picked up the glass, stared at it, and gulped it down.

“More?” he asked. When I nodded, he brought the bottle, unscrewed the cap and poured more. It burned a little, warmed my throat, and turned my crying into hiccups. I took another as he watched me without judging, but I saw his jaw tighten once. He went to sit on the armrest of the sofa.

After a while, the heat spread through me and blunted the edge of deep sorrow. I felt better. I looked up at him. He was quiet, watching me with his sharp gaze. “My fiancé cheated on me with my stepsister,” I said finally. “We were supposed to marry in three days, and I found them having sex today.”

“He doesn’t deserve you,” he growled animalistically.

I clenched my teeth and became quiet for a few minutes. Then, I said hesitantly, “I want to ask you something.”

“Ask,” he replied, his voice rough, studying me like he was committing my features to his memory.

“Am I… pretty enough?”

For a second, he was startled. “Pretty? You are the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” he breathed. Then he did the most bizarre thing. He tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. “You are so pretty that I can have sex with you right now.”

My lips parted in surprise at his blatant readiness. Like the word hesitation didn’t exist in his dictionary? I asked, “Do you offer yourself for sex to strangers like this?”

His gaze became more intense. “No, usually, it’s the strangers who offer themselves to me every time. But I have offered myself to anyone for the first time. You can take advantage of my body. You know, like revenge sex?”

I licked my lip, blushing. I wanted to end this feeling of feeling used. He was staring at me to gauge my reaction. I wanted to refuse even though the idea of revenge sex was enticing.

He insisted, “Trust me, I’d be happy to be used by you.”

I blushed harder, and bit my bottom lip. He came forward, crouched in front me and pulled my bottom lip out. “You won’t regret it,” he said, watching my lips. He was so close that his body’s heat seeped inside me.

My breath faltered. I felt like I was being hypnotized by him. What was he doing to me? “Umm…” An ache developed between my thighs. Craig was never able to elicit this reaction in me.

His nostrils flared as he searched my face a moment longer. “I won’t touch you unless you want it,” he said, becoming tense.

I gulped down more wine, and then nodded, “Okay!” I think it was the wine speaking on my behalf.

His shoulders eased as if he was holding tension inside him. He got up, slid one arm under my knees and the other behind my back, and lifted me like I weighed nothing. I gasped as I wrapped my arms around his neck. Up close, he was even more beautiful. Being carried by him felt oddly safe. He walked into a bedroom that was exquisitely furnished.

He set me on the edge of the bed and took a step back, giving me space. “We can stop at any time,” he said as if through a lot of restraint. “You only have to say the word.”

I looked at my hands, then at him. I stood and reached for the zipper of my dress. My fingers fumbled. He came close and eased the zipper down without touching my skin. The dress slid to the floor. I stood there in simple lingerie, feeling shy.

His breath hitched as he took my body in. “You are divine,” he said, like he meant every word. “You don’t need to prove anything to anyone.”

I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. He moved with a calm I needed, speaking to me in short, steady sentences that told me I was safe, and in control. When he kissed me, it wasn’t rushed. He waited for me to respond. When I did, he deepened it, but always let me lead.

He removed his clothes, and when we finally lay down naked, he paused again. “Are you still sure?”

“Yes,” I said as I moved my fingers over his tattooed body. There was a tattoo of a wolf on his chest with vines that ran all the way to his shoulders and arms. God must have taken his time to sculpt this masterpiece.

He cupped my face and kissed me. When his lips met mine, and the world seemed to vanish. My breath hitched, my heart racing as warmth spread through me. His mouth moved against mine desperately with a hunger that made me tremble, like he couldn’t get enough of me. I found myself melting into his arms, my fingers clutching at him. The taste of him was sweet and intoxicating, making me forget everything but the fire between us. Every second his kiss pulled me deeper into him, until I no longer knew where I ended and he began. It was pure, consuming passion.

He went lower to my breasts and sucked my nipples hard. My body hummed with need so intense that I whimpered. “You’re so beautiful,” he murmured reverently. He went lower, lower and kissed my belly button.

“Ah!” I moaned.

He went down to my sex, and stared at it for a long moment. And then he blew hot air over it, and parted my lips.",1,1764842784.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I am a caffeine and sugar addict, but since running my first marathon about a week ago I have been completely turned off by both.

All I've been craving lately is salty and fatty foods. And it truly feels like there's something wrong with me, mainly because this is not my usual attitude towards food, but now a boiled egg seems much more inticing to me than a cookie.



I feel like I'm just so fully fueled that my blood sugar never gets low enough for me to want sugar or coffee, and it concerns me a bit just because I'm not sure if I overdid it or am maybe experiencing high blood sugar now or something?

  
I ate plenty of carbs (probably double what I normally would) in the few days before the marathon. During I had 4 gels and about 20oz of gatorade, plus a couple electrolyre tablets and tons of water. I ate a lot of carbs after too. But now I can't stand the thought of something sweet. But give me rice cakes with cheese and eggs and I'll devour them all day long.



Just wondering if anyone else has had abnormal cravings after a big race, and if this is par for the course or indicative of some sort of fault in my fueling? Or any tips for post marathon nutrition in general?",2,1764842697.0,XXRunning,2,1.0,False

Walking down an otherwise empty street, I sipped my coffee through the straw. A couple was walking in the opposite direction and, in passing, the woman said, “Just letting you know that it’s very rude to eat while walking in Japan.” I said “ok” and continued on my way. 

I was kind of struck and felt that it was inappropriate of her to confront me. I understand that’s it’s uncommon to find a Japanese person eating or drinking while walking, and it is frowned upon in a busy setting, but otherwise is fine. So either I’m mistaken in my understanding of Japanese norms or I just happened upon an overly online tourist? In the case of the latter, hello!

By the way, I am white and had a camera strapped around me, so I obviously looked like a tourist. She was Asian but had a perfect English accent, and she was walking with a white man.

While i think he just tries to wind me up by making big deals out of things i say or do to get some sort of reaction from me(i used to react and jump to defend what ever he said when i first met him) so probably made it worse for myself by then.

Anyways this week for what ever reason he needed to take my van as rest of us stayed late, now this guy is anal about everything, so i said to the others i better go make sure van is spotless and off i went to move baby seat from the front into the back so he wouldnt be moaning....anyways all seems well and asked for key back later that evening and he started going on how it was filthy and he went on about a coffee mug in the back with....a coffee stain on it(i put it in the back same time as car seat so it was out of the way and he didnt really need to be in back of van anyways) and then he kept at it and insaid sure i said to other lads youll go out of your way to find something to moan about.

So all forgotten about until next morning at breakfast were he sat few tables away and started again saying i should leave half hour early and give van a scrub as there was 2 inches of dirt and grim on the dashboard and i should be ashamed of myself, quite loudly ill add. Now to be clear there was not even a spec of dust on the dash or anything that would bother anyone. Funnily enough he had left two water bottles in the front seat too which was messier than the van was when he got it. I just dont get what je gets from it. I tried laughing it off and said he was so predictable i told lads this is exactly what he would do. 

Anyways both in 40s he is older actually and cant believe he carries on like this and admittedly it just bothers me more than it should. 

When i first met him and went to a job down country with him the boss asked me to nip down and fix something in a nearby job....i mistakenly took same guys ladder instead of mine(exactly same ladder) and he lost his shit, rang me ranting and i hung up on him....then at dinner he went on about it again even though i apologised to keep the peace coz i took wrong ladder for an hour.

So, I'm a lesbian, and I met this girl on a dating app a few days ago. I was trying to take it easy and slow because I've had quite a few horrible experiences with dating apps since the beginning of the year, but she made it hard. I have a pretty specific type and she fit it exactly.

We talked for a while on the app; she seemed really interested in me, so I asked for her Instagram. Same energy over there: super friendly, pretty flirty, really nice. We recommended each other movies, so we shared our Letterboxd. We ended up sharing TikToks too. Everything was so fun and I felt so at ease and we talked for hours and hours.

She always had a slight delay with responding, but I figured since her bio on the app said she was more of an “in person” type than a texter, it checked out. Yesterday, it was just awful — like a crash down. She barely responded, but I still hoped she was just busy.

In the evening, I was so desperate to get the attention she had given me in the prior days that I asked her if she would go out with me for coffee since I would be in her city the next day. I've been on delivered for 20 hours and I'm just so confused and saddened. I know she is online, she's seen the story I posted a few hours ago, and she's been reposting stuff on TikTok. But I keep telling myself that if she wanted to truly ghost me, wouldn't she have unfollowed/blocked me everywhere? She still follows me on Letterboxd, IG, and TikTok.

Also, how long is it currently usual to wait until you know that a person has definitely ghosted you? I know it all happened in a really short amount of time, and I'm embarrassed I even got the slightest bit attached in these few days, but I'm a very emotionally intense person, and this is just yet another thing that feels like a betrayal.

I hired an interior designer to help furnish my home. He recommended two couches, and I trusted that he handled the space planning. Recently I measured the room myself and realized the couches take up exactly 50% of the living room (46in depth each)— way more than is appropriate.

When I brought it up, he said he’s “putting his foot down” and won’t return the couches. But I contacted the company, and they told me they do allow returns — plus, the couches haven’t even been delivered yet.

This isn’t the first time he’s selected furniture that doesn’t fit the space. Past issues include a dining room table that was too large, a coffee table in the wrong color (which I didn’t push back on), incorrectly sized kitchen drawer handles, and other similar mistakes.

Meanwhile, I keep receiving design bills from him. I’ve been paying $1,500 every month for the past five months for design work that hasn’t resulted in a usable piece of furniture, major delays in him responding, and often not getting a response at all to emails and texts asking for updates.

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this? Do designers normally measure spaces before ordering furniture, or am I wrong for expecting that? How would you handle this if you were in my position?

I feel stuck — paying hundreds per month for design work that hasn’t produced usable furniture — and now I’m being told I can’t return the items that clearly won’t fit.

I've only started my medication journey, only 2 weeks in and the results vary dramatically. 

Sometimes it can be very effective (ability to start and complete tasks) and other times it doesn't do anything (back to staring at a screen and unable to execute), however my anxiety and food noise is greatly reduced every time so something is working. 

It's usually the 7am dose that doesn't work well. Sometimes the right amount of caffeine will help slightly, otherwise I'll feel terrible for having some. 

I've tried eating, not eating, coffee, no coffee, waiting longer, higher and lower doses and the same thing happens.

He was “around” when I was growing up, but my mother divorced him before I was a teenager because while he “supported” the family with income (which he hid some of from my mother), he regularly didn’t do much to actually raise the kids in the house. 



I remember countless “family” dinners growing up where Dad had to “work late” and would frequently arrive home after all of the kids had gone to bed for the evening. As I got older, I learned that “working late” meant “going to the bar with his work buddies to get drunk so he can avoid his kids every evening.” Thanks for the therapy, Dad. I always thought it was weird when you got upset when I would have alcohol in my house, now I know why.



Over the past few years, he has started to get far worse in his selfishness, but this year left me pretty stunned by how thick-headed he really is. 



I regularly will see him on Thanksgiving at the family get-together; my birthday is a week after it, so he regularly would bring a birthday gift of some kind for me. 



This year, he gifted me a coffee mug that he bought on Amazon. I’m not a \*huge\* fan of generic made-in-China stuff; personally, I would love a coffee mug that was hand-made somewhere by someone locally. But the mug was also very overpriced and had terrible reviews. I mean, it’s the thought that counts though, right? Never mind that my spouse and mother went together on getting me a Supercar driving experience on a race track (which I am wicked pumped for). 



Here is where the real kicker comes in: on my actual birthday, my dad called to give me best wishes. Then \*immediately\* started to brag about his brand new MacBook that was supposed to arrive in the mail any minute. 



I honestly felt a bit stunned. 



He spent nothing on my birthday gift; found something that was poorly made and poorly reviewed and turned around and got himself something very nice instead. 



Yes, he has always been this dense. I think I would be less bothered by it had he just not gotten me anything and not called. At least then I wouldn't have known he bought himself a nice gift for his son's birthday.



I really could go on about the awful decisions he has made over the years; quite frankly, I found it more difficult to not go on a tirade whilst writing this about all of the other fun experiences I had growing up, but I think I will leave that for my therapist.

This is my process (apologies if I’m not using the right terminology)

-Ground coffee beans using a delonghi electrical grinder until reaching “Fine” mode in the machine (machine has coarse, medium and fine modes)

-Measure 7gr for a single espresso

-Use the plastic scoop and tamper that came with the machine to make sure coffee is evenly distributed in the basket

-Set timer for 25 seconds for desired shot length 

-Steam milk (optional)

The espresso comes up with a bit of crema on top (not a very thick one), and definitely tastes more watery than when I get espressos in a coffee shop. And you can see the sediments on the bottom of the glass.

just walking around minding my business, not even acknowledging im wearing it tbh.. 

this random tourist came up to me at a café and said i was being “tone deaf” and “rubbing wealth in people’s faces” by wearing luxury brands in a place where a lot of ppl struggle financially

i literally wasn’t even talking to her.. just trying to drink my coffee.. i told her “it’s just clothes” and she said i should “respect the environment more” and dress in a way that doesn’t “create a class divide”

idk i didn’t think wearing my own stuff was some moral issue locals didn’t say anything or act weird. just the tourist policing me like she’s the fashion police for world poverty

Founders and sales leaders do coffee chats, LinkedIn DMs, and warm intros.

 I started to stress out as I know that I am locked inside my house and I know I might not be able to make it to work. I tried to call my husband and I remembered that we had a conflict last night I ended up sleeping in the guest's room. The thing is he had drink a few and was kinda mean to me. So I told him that I didn't want and anrgument with him.

 Anyhow.. I started to panick. I also had an anxiety attack. I called my nighbors who was able to unlock me within 2 hours which was great. I am a teacher. My students were excited for today's activity it broke my heart. I had to call the school so they could cancel my classes and reschedule them for another day.

The situation made me feel very frunstrated and I was literally shivering. I couldn't believe that he could be so immature to do such a move. I was asking all the questions. I have seen lots of videos of women talking about how men keeps sqbotaging them and making their lives miserable. 

I never thought my partner who I thought I chose well would have done this to me. 
I ended up  being able to make it to the last two hours with a different class and was able to manage the absence as I explained. But I was really discusted and nervous. I wasn't able to eat and I made a mistake on the board. 

Anyhow. I think I was still brave after going after what I felt because I was so sad and angry. I kept listening to music to motivate myself. 

5 pm he calls to say he is at home and he doesnt have the keys. I asked him to give me my keys first. He was like.. what. Compmete denial he didn't take them. He doesn't know. It's me who lost my keys and tries to blame his wonderful soul. Even myself started to believe it. I repeat again, give them to me because I never changed their spot. I am sure that you took them. He said ok dear calm down. We'll get inside and search. I say okay I oped the outside door. He enters. Blames me for trying to incriminate him. 

I say so where are my keys and he points at the end of tje counter and I say but those are not my keys. He says ok lool closer maybe it's in the corner. I get closer and they are just under some package. You can't really see it if you don't remove the thing. So I was in chock.. yet I was trying to understand.. I ask did you put my keys in here. He bullshits me to try and make me believe it was me.I straight looked to him and told him that he is a liar. he then pauses and says ok I think it was me who put them there but trust me it was not voluntarily. I didnt mean to hide them. I mistook them for my keys and put them mistakingly there on my way out. I thought to myself that this is also bullshit. 

So I went back to the guests room and I think thats where I'd be for the next couple of days. I took my shower and went out with a few collegues and now I am home. 

I try not to think about it.. but I can't believe that he took me for an idiot. I also now think that this isn't the first time he might be gaslighting me. 

I am sharing this to make sure I am not crazy.
I would appreciate your help.

My wife and I drink 5-6 coffees a day(combined). We mainly like medium/dark roasts. 95% of the time we drink with milk. I have already ordered a Eureka Mignon Specialita.

I would like a machine I can ""play"" with and have convinced my wife to get a more involved machine than our current full auto that is on its way out.

Things we would like:

 * Having a button for a single shot (and ideally one for a double) goes a long way.

 * A machine that is heavy enough to lock in the portafilter with one hand.

 * A decent milk wand, though it doesn't have to be on while pulling a shot.

 * Heating up fairly quickly would be good. 5-10 minutes would be ok.

 * Big bonus if it could be maintained fairly easily and wasent something we would need to replace in 2-5 years.

I had pretty much sold myself on the Breville dual boiler, but it is BIG and likely has more bells and whistles than I really need. The bambino looked interesting but I think we would struggle with the one hand situation and it feels like something we would need to look at replacing after a few years. Was wondering if there was another option that fit my criteria that wasent going to go outside of that dual boiler ballpark cost?

Most people assume every DVD converter runs at roughly the same pace—pop in a disc, wait a bit, done.  
But once you actually start converting your old collection, you discover the truth the hard way: two programs running on the *exact same machine* can deliver totally different experiences. One breezes through a disc before you’ve even made coffee. The other feels like it’s aging in real time.

And here's the part nobody warns you about:

Your DVDs are aging too.

Every year, a little more warping. A little more scratching.  
Layers separate, playback stutters, and suddenly the movie you meant to digitize “someday” refuses to play at all.

That’s why **speed isn’t just convenience—it’s survival** for your library.

Fast converters don’t get stuck in endless retry loops. They handle damaged sectors without dragging your system through mud. And if you’ve got a whole shelf of movies, workouts, or family recordings waiting to be rescued, the difference between a 10-minute rip and a 50-minute slog determines whether this project gets finished… or forgotten.

Modern GPU-accelerated tools can cut your time nearly in half—and no, they don’t sacrifice quality to do it.

Curious how big the speed gap really is?  
I tested the leading converters side-by-side, all on the same hardware, and the results were… surprising.

1pdvrbs,/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1pden7p/husband_purposly_hid_my_keys/,Husband purposly hid my keys,"Husband purposly hid my keys

I woke up today and I was headed to work. After having my coffee.. I was headed to work. I can't find my keys. I usually  put them on the counter. It's their place.
 I started to stress out as I know that I am locked inside my house and I know I might not be able to make it to work. I tried to call my husband and I remembered that we had a conflict last night I ended up sleeping in the guest's room. The thing is he had drink a few and was kinda mean to me. So I told him that I didn't want and anrgument with him.

 Anyhow.. I started to panick. I also had an anxiety attack. I called my nighbors who was able to unlock me within 2 hours which was great. I am a teacher. My students were excited for today's activity it broke my heart. I had to call the school so they could cancel my classes and reschedule them for another day.

The situation made me feel very frunstrated and I was literally shivering. I couldn't believe that he could be so immature to do such a move. I was asking all the questions. I have seen lots of videos of women talking about how men keeps sqbotaging them and making their lives miserable. 

I never thought my partner who I thought I chose well would have done this to me. 
I ended up  being able to make it to the last two hours with a different class and was able to manage the absence as I explained. But I was really discusted and nervous. I wasn't able to eat and I made a mistake on the board. 

Anyhow. I think I was still brave after going after what I felt because I was so sad and angry. I kept listening to music to motivate myself. 

5 pm he calls to say he is at home and he doesnt have the keys. I asked him to give me my keys first. He was like.. what. Compmete denial he didn't take them. He doesn't know. It's me who lost my keys and tries to blame his wonderful soul. Even myself started to believe it. I repeat again, give them to me because I never changed their spot. I am sure that you took them. He said ok dear calm down. We'll get inside and search. I say okay I oped the outside door. He enters. Blames me for trying to incriminate him. 

I say so where are my keys and he points at the end of tje counter and I say but those are not my keys. He says ok lool closer maybe it's in the corner. I get closer and they are just under some package. You can't really see it if you don't remove the thing. So I was in chock.. yet I was trying to understand.. I ask did you put my keys in here. He bullshits me to try and make me believe it was me.I straight looked to him and told him that he is a liar. he then pauses and says ok I think it was me who put them there but trust me it was not voluntarily. I didnt mean to hide them. I mistook them for my keys and put them mistakingly there on my way out. I thought to myself that this is also bullshit. 

So I went back to the guests room and I think thats where I'd be for the next couple of days. I took my shower and went out with a few collegues and now I am home. 

I try not to think about it.. but I can't believe that he took me for an idiot. I also now think that this isn't the first time he might be gaslighting me. 

I am sharing this to make sure I am not crazy.
I would appreciate your help. 

Idk what to do tbh. How can I deal with this behaviour?

**Original: How to return my neighbour's plate**

I have been living next to this kind German woman for the last one year. This year on Christmas I made a card for her and left on her doorstep along with chocolates because I genuinely wanted to wish her. I didn't expect but next morning she came with a plate full of Christmas Cookies and handed my boyfriend the plate(I was sleeping) and told him how much she loved the card and wanted to give us something sweet because we are away from home. That was so kind of her.

However, I now don't know how to return her plate. I don't know what is appropriate to fill the plate with. I have thought of three things:

1. More Chocolate
2. Store bought Donuts or Croissants
3. I bake a cake and return the plate filled with it.

Now I'm not very confident about my baking but if I followed the instructions the cake does come out okay (not the best kind)

Kindly let me know what is the appropriate thing to put in the plate. It's already been three days that her plate is with me and I'd like to return it within next two days!

Thanks!

**Comments:**

**Comment1**: Love to hear that you guys have such a great relationship with your neighbors!  
First of all, I don’t think they’ll be upset if your cake isn’t bakery-level, so stay confident in your skills.  
Second, maybe you could return the plate empty and send some kind of invitation—like for a game night or something like that?

>**OOP**: Omg! I love your idea! May be I'll do both! I'm heavily leaning towards baking a cake for her.. can't hand out the plate empty(my religion/culture dictates I can not absolutely for the love of God return empty vessels) but the idea for the Game night is absolutely amazing! I'll definitely invite her in this weekend! Thank you so much!

**Comment2:** I'm a german and i would say ""you dont return a favor for a returned favor"" if you understand what i want to say😅  
Return the cleaned plate in person and have a smalltalk or with a little note on her step would be the german way.

>**OOP**: I get it. I did not want her to return the favour initially. I was just wishing her because I found her to be very kind. I did not know she'll hand a plate of handmade cookies (which was once again very very kind). But you see, I can not return an empty plate, it's not in my culture/religion. But now I'm thinking I should leave a box of chocolates or something with a note on her doorstep (don't want to bother her!). Thanks!

**Comment3**: Option 3, cake, but just as many slices as they have people in that flat

>**OOP**: She lives alone. I have had multiple conversations with her by now. And she is so kind. I am heavily leaning on the third option as well. I just don't know if she'll like what I make!

**Comment4:** Let her have her kind gesture as well, it was nice of you and she wanted to show her appreciation. If you really care about her and not your traditions you should just return it clean and tell her how delicious it was.

>**OOP**: I think that is a very good idea. I have been too stuck in my own ways and traditions that I never considered that may be this isn't just about me. Thank you so much!

**Comment5**: If you want to give something back, you could buy a Little flower in a pot instead of a cake. Giving flowers is quite common.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update: (next day)** 

Everyone helped me so much with deciding what to get for my neighbour and I decided I'd go with the Thank You Note, and thanking her in person and I did that. She is just the kindest, warmest and most wonderful person I've ever met. I just can't put into words how amazing a person she is and how grateful I am to you guys for suggesting that I thank her in person! Like someone suggested I did request her to come over for coffee and to my surprise she agreed to a filter coffee(Indian Style)!

Thank you everyone!

1pdvoyj,https://i.redd.it/vnt5qxzpo55g1.jpeg,Liz Lemon’s Boyfriends Ranked,"1. Wesley Snipes (Michael Sheen)
IDK why I love him so much but their lack of chemistry is hilarious, he is still somehow charming (kudos to Sheen) and his delivery is perfect. His pantomime skills are 👌

2. Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm)
Another one with amazing timing and delivery. While I don’t love that his character actually changes and becomes an absolute dullard, Hamm plays it so well. The scene with his hooks, his physicality is so good. He had the better Jamaican woman accent. 

3. Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters)
I know he’s everyone’s favorite but there are moments he is, yes albeit intentionally, so irrational it drives me up the wall lol. His lines are amazing though, perfect spot for a coffee vending machine.

4, 5 and 6 because they are all interchangeable to me-

Floyd Debarber (Jason Sudeikis)
He was probably Liz’ best option being the most somewhat normal. Character wise, he was boring and completely under utilized for the man’s talent.

Criss Chris (James Marsden)
I have to admit I don’t watch passed early Season 6 very often and find him boring as well. He’s sweet and handsome but James is not known for laugh out loud moments.

Carol (Matt Damon)
I feel like he’s just a footnote and also boring. I forgot they even dated and he existed for a long while when thinking of this list lol. The best part of his character is their break up brought us it’s Never Too Late for Now which is one of the best episodes. 

Other Honorable Mentions:

Grizz (it’s actually Grizz): They did not have enough on screen moments and I want to know what she did to make him cry.

Stuart Le Grange (Peter Dinklage): I mean it’s Tyrion. Their personalities actually meshed well and he even coined “shut it down”. He may have been the one.

Brad Halster (Roger Bart): He’s the man Liz seduces when network is doing cutbacks. His delivery of “she’s a monster” when he finds out Liz just used him will never not make me laugh out loud.

James Franco: For as much as everyone hates him nowadays, I thought he was surprisingly good playing this version of himself. He sold his love for a body pillow pretty damn well and good for Lemon for bagging him in his prime.

Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson): I think Danny was disappointingly under utilized and he had good chemistry with Tina, I wish they did more with his character. But can’t blame the guy for bailing after meeting Tom.

Gavin Volure (Steve Martin): it’s Steve Martin. They could have at least had a nice life in Canada, without all the stuff.

Banyani (Liz’ island lover): good for him

Turns out it’s just talking to humans like a normal person. Here’s exactly how it turned my job hunt around in 2025:

1. Starteryou became my secret weapon I made a profile, added my two school projects, and started following people in my target companies. Every week I’d comment genuinely on their posts (“That dashboard looks clean what stack did you use?”). Two recruiters and one hiring manager followed me back within a month.
2. I messaged 5 people with the easiest template ever “Hey \[Name\], I saw your team is hiring interns. I’m a \[your year\] \[your major\] student and just shipped \[project link\]. Would love 5 minutes of your time to ask about the role ” 4 out of 5 replied. One forwarded my résumé straight to the hiring manager.
3. Joined 2 Discord / Slack communities (free)
   * One was Starteryou’s student community
   * The other was a small PH tech Slack Someone posted “my startup needs a part-time dev intern” → I replied in-thread → got interviewed the same week → offer two days later.
4. Coffee chats > cover letters After every positive reply I asked “would you be down for a quick 15-min call?” 7 chats → 4 referral codes → skipped the ATS black hole completely.

End result:

* 3 months of cold-applying = 0 interviews
* 3 weeks of casual networking = 3 offers (picked the best one)

Moral of the story:  
One real conversation beats 100 perfect applications.  
Starteryou + genuine comments + short polite messages  does magic

سلام عليكم 

Soooo.. I was talking to this girl and she brought up how her and her mom were actually about to call me (yesterday) to ask for my hand. Initially, I was like oh! then maybe… then no. 

Now hear me out. Most of you know who I am (reddit persona) and know that I put personality>looks, and literally have a few times. So don’t even say anything about me going for looks because i’m not. Everyone does always have some superficial level of having a type and wanting their husband to be a specific way. Don’t act like you don’t. 

He’s a really good guy like everyone says that about him and his immediate family. He’s on his deen, he’s an electrician/constructor, good akhlaq, you get the gist. 

  
But. When his sister sent me a pic of him, he isn’t my type at all. Like even when it comes to personality>looks there’s at LEAST 1 thing you like. I didn’t find anything attractive. To be completely honest, I’m afraid of men who look old or are old due to past trauma. He’s 29, and i’m 23(as of yesterday😛) so it’s not a hugeeee gap, but it is out of my range by a year. Though, he just looks soooo old, like he looks in his 40s at 29. 

  
Everyone thinks it’s naseeb because everyone was making duaa that i find someone and blablabla, but I feel 0 towards him. Nothing at all. Not a single thing pulling me to him. Like nothing in my gut saying meet the guy. 

  
My friends and family don’t really know about my traumas, so they think my worries are just superficial. They say oh he’s an amazing guy you’ll miss out, but I just truly do not want the guy at all. They keep saying at least call his mom and sister over for some coffee, and it’s like why??!!? I already know I will say no 100%. They did this to me before. I literally told them there’s 0 way I will say yes, and they kept asking and asking so I was like yes whatever. Met with the guy and was literally proven right lol. No common interests at all. 

  
I feel like now I have to do the same thing and for what??? I already know I will say no. I told them I will say no. Why waste everyone’s time??? 

  
Also, I know I made posts talking about how Ive been wanting to get married so badly lately, but this being brought up strayed me far far away. I always get this feeling. I guess it’s because I have a disorganized attachment style, so I am part avoidant. The whole process just terrifies me. 

  
I just don’t want to waste anyone’s time. I know even if the guy matches what I want, I will still say no. I just can’t. There is 0 pull. Nothing at all. 



What should I do? It’s only been 2 days and I’m sick of everyone (my fam & friends) constantly calling me every 2 seconds to meet with his family. Even if I meet the guy and say no they will talk even more. It’ll be the same thing again and again. Oh you are cutting off naseeb oh you’re ruining your life oh you’re pushing away any chance for marriage oh you’re gonna be undesirable now oh you always say no one asks for your hand but when they do you say no oh he’s a perfect guy you’re missing out blablablablabla

  
Like I don’t care. This is MY life. Why would I marry someone I don’t want at all just because everyone wants me to??? A girl can’t have her own opinions and life choices damn. They act like THEY will be living with him 24/7 like what.",0,1764840177.0,MuslimNikah,6,0.5,False

Because right now the antizionist hate movement feels emboldened to purge Jews from public life. Simple as that.  
  
I heard of a Jewish-owned coffee shop whose suppliers were bombarded with demands to “stop supplying Zionists.” A Jewish doctor who took her name off her office door. A Jewish lawyer whose firm refused to post condolences after the Manchester synagogue attack “because people will be upset we didn’t say anything about Gaza.” A Jewish school telling students to remove their blazers on public transport. A Jewish student too scared to join her own Jewish society. A Jewish teacher hiding her identity because she has no idea what parents are telling their kids at home. A Jewish charity worker who’d rather say he’s unemployed. A young professional told not to mention she was visiting Israel or her leave wouldn’t be approved.  
  
All this from a couple of hours of small talk.  
  
There is a real, palpable fear that Britain is turning on the Jews.  
  
Part of the shift stems from the rapid growth of the UK's Muslim population. British Jews are now outnumbered 16:1. Some British cities are now more heavily Muslim than Israel’s “mixed” cities—Acre, Lod, Ramle, Haifa, even Jerusalem. I spoke to people who devoted their lives to interfaith work who now believe there is no point continuing. Moderate, reasonable British Muslims exist—but they are scared of angering extremists by “normalizing Zionists.”  
  
Hostility to Jews who refuse to denounce Israel has become “part of the Zeitgeist.” And this hate movement is accelerating because decent British people don’t want to fight it. They don’t recognize it. They don’t understand it. They like rooting for the underdog, so they’ve framed Israelis as bullies. And they keep their heads down because they don’t want to cause a fuss.  
  
But silence is how a purge succeeds.  
  
The antizionist hate movement cannot be allowed to drive Jews out of public life.

1pdve70,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pdve70/boarding_a_flight_to_propose_but_my_mind_is_on_a/,"Boarding a flight to propose, but my mind is on a different woman.","With an engagement ring I’ve saved up for, I am now boarding a plane to finally ask my girlfriend for her hand in marriage. While thinking of what’s ahead, my mind is on a different woman… someone I met days prior.

See, my previous relationship of 7 years ended because I cheated. I felt guilty. And I wanted to change, and listened to the stories of men who have broken the cycle, and they’d always say that change must come from within myself. “No matter who your spouse is, even if it were Anne Hathaway, if you’re a cheater, you will really cheat.” In the end, the ball is in my court whether I will cheat again, regardless of who I’m with and whatever flaws she has.

And so, determined to be faithful and never cheat again, I went into another relationship with a beautiful woman who works abroad. I feel lucky that I’ve gotten this girl—she’s caring, thoughtful, the type who feels like the light of a home, plus she’s a 10/10 looks-wise, gets the stares everywhere we go.

Despite these, our intellectual bond is weak. Our conversations tend to be shallow and boring. Most times, we’d call each other while doing something else on our phones. Her libido does not match mine. She likes it vanilla, I like mine chocolate. I’m more open to new ideas, while she prefers familiar approaches. She’s the type to be closed off about her past (which I know about), and I’m open about mine. Don’t get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with her—it just feels like she’s oil and I’m water.

But, as I promised myself back then, the next relationship I go into will be the last, and I will be faithful no matter what. As they say, the change has to come from me regardless of the differences we have. And so, even if our conversations and sex were a bit boring, our relationship was still working.

Fast forward, she was throwing subtle hints of proposal and marriage, which I initially thought I wanted to do with her too. And so, months after her hints, I finally saved up and bought a nice diamond ring, flight tickets to visit her, and all the expenses.

As my flight approached nearer and nearer, anxiety began creeping in. Was I truly ready for this commitment? Could a marriage thrive on discipline and my values alone, without genuine compatibility? Were we aligned in the life we envisioned together? The excitement was there, but so was the weight of what this moment meant. Every mile closer felt like a mix of hope and uncertainty—a silent tug-of-war between love and fear.

And so, two months before my flight to propose, I’m not sure why—maybe anxiety, maybe a relapse—I went on r4r and met a few people for friendly, SFW dates. Yes, I know that counts as cheating in its own way. But I felt I needed to understand where I truly stood before taking such a huge step. The women I met shared a similar mindset and were on the same mental wavelength as me, but despite that, each date made me feel validated to continue my plans with my current girlfriend.

Two days before my flight, I checked r4r again “for the very last time,” I said. And I met someone who was recently cheated on by her boyfriend—how ironic. I met a total of four women, including her, and while I had the same mental wavelength with most of them, this one was different. She had a warmth that felt like home, a smile that could turn a bad day into poetry, and a way of listening that made the world feel less heavy. With her, conversations didn’t just flow—they danced. We were like coffee and cream as opposed to oil and water. She was as open as a book, just like me—except for the footnote I never mentioned: that in two days, I’d be boarding a plane to propose to someone else.

Now, I am still boarding my flight—not to propose, but to break it off. After seeing what it would be like to be with someone who mixes with me naturally, I now know that this is the right thing to do for me and my current girlfriend. Not because I want to be with this new girl, but because I know that discipline and willpower alone are not enough for a person like me to be faithful. That advice—“No matter who it is”—might be true for most, but not for me. I think I can’t be faithful to just anyone, but only to someone who touches both my mind and soul in a way that feels natural.

Yes, I am a cheater. I feel ashamed and guilty. I am human. And I hope it’s something I can conquer as a man.

I can only wish that I met R at a different time. And just maybe.

We are in a long-distance relationship currently, pre wedding which is due in 4 months.

We talk every day on the phone and meet weekly or every 2 weeks. Last month we met every week actually.

We got engaged a few months back, like in September. She has around 5 male friends who she hangs out with every week, also during weekdays for coffee. I'm okay with having friends to hang out with after work. But every now and then, they hang out at a resort to chill as well. Also, most of the time these guys take up her expenses.

I told her not to go to the resort with these 5 male friends of hers.

Also, I suggested her not be ""touchy"" and ""feely"" with her male friends either. I understood this when she sent me a photo of her friend she hung out with.

She keeps saying I have an 1800's mindset and ""we are not the same"". I said I'm not comfortable with this behaviour, her being around men and being too physical, like holding hands and leaning on their arms and stuff. Also, these male friends feed her food sometimes, I heard her say it.

She is talking to me less now, but she did say yes, she will cut down the behaviour and also not go to the resort with the 5 male friends of hers.

Am I in the wrong here? Am I being too controlling? She said I'm conrolling her now, I told her this issue has been huring me for a while and I had to bring it up when she said she is going to the resort with her male friends again this weekend.

I'm 29. He's 32. We met right after I finished nursing school and he was working as a barista at this coffee shop near the hospital. He had this whole thing about how he was ""stuck"" in a job that didn't fulfill him creatively, how he had all these business ideas but never had the support or resources to pursue them. He said his parents told him to just get a real job and stop dreaming.

I fell for it completely. I thought I was being supportive.

Six months into dating, I picked up extra shifts. Then I started working doubles three or four times a week. I'm a nurse in the ICU so the pay is decent, but those hours destroy you. I'd come home at 2am and he'd be on the couch with his laptop, ""researching business opportunities."" I'd fall into bed and wake up to go do it again.

He told me he needed about $800 a month for ""business expenses"" while he figured out his path. Networking events, online courses, software subscriptions, meetings with potential partners. I said okay. I trusted him. I thought we were building something together.

This went on for three years.

Three years of me working 60-70 hour weeks while he ""explored options."" He tried day trading for four months. Then cryptocurrency. Then he was going to start a consulting business. Then it was going to be a podcast about entrepreneurship. Nothing ever launched. But the expenses kept coming.

""Babe, I need new equipment for content creation.""

""There's this seminar that could really help me network.""

""I have to upgrade my software to the professional version.""

I paid for everything. Rent, groceries, utilities, his car insurance, his gym membership, his phone bill. Plus the $800 a month in business expenses that somehow kept creeping up to $1200, then $1500.

My friends started asking questions around year two. My sister told me I was being used. I defended him every time. I said they didn't understand what it was like to have a partner with ambition, someone who wasn't willing to settle for mediocrity.

God, I was so stupid.

Four months ago, he told me he was finally ready to launch something real. He needed a bigger investment though. $15,000 for LLC formation, website development, initial inventory for a product he wanted to sell. He showed me spreadsheets. Projected profits. A whole business plan.

I had been saving for our wedding. We'd been engaged for a year and I had about $22,000 put away. I gave him the $15,000.

Two weeks later, he drove home in a Tesla Model 3.

I was standing in the driveway when he pulled up, and my first thought was that it was beautiful. My second thought was how the hell did he afford it. He got out grinning, and I asked him what was happening.

""I got a great lease deal,"" he said. ""Don't worry, it's only $900 a month.""

I asked him how he was planning to pay $900 a month when he didn't have income.

He looked annoyed. ""That's why I need to get the business off the ground. This is an investment in my image. People take you seriously when you drive something like this.""

I asked where the LLC was. Where the website was. Where the inventory was.

He said I was being unsupportive and it took time to build something real.

We fought for two hours. I didn't speak to him for three days. But then he apologized and said he'd show me the business plan was real, and I wanted to believe him so badly that I just let it go.

Last week, I was scrolling Instagram during a break at work and saw a car photo account I follow had posted a Tesla. Beautiful shot, mountain background, sunset. I almost scrolled past it but something made me zoom in on the reflection in the paint.

It was his Tesla. Same custom plate he'd gotten. Same small dent on the front bumper from when he hit a parking barrier the first week.

My hands started shaking. I went to the account and scrolled back. There were six more photos of the same car over the past three months. Different locations, different times of day. And in four of them, if you looked carefully at the windows or the paint reflection, you could see a woman in the passenger seat.

Long dark hair. Young, maybe mid-twenties. In one photo her face was partially visible and she was laughing.

I left work early. I told them I was sick, which wasn't even a lie because I thought I was going to throw up in the parking lot.

I went home and he was there on the couch, on his laptop as always. I asked him who she was.

He looked confused. I showed him the photos. I watched his face change.

""That's just Emma,"" he said. ""She's been helping me with the business. I told you about her.""

He had never mentioned anyone named Emma.

I asked how long this had been going on.

""Nothing's going on,"" he said. ""Jesus, you're being paranoid. She's a business consultant I met at one of those networking events. She's been advising me.""

I asked why a business consultant was posing for photos in his Tesla that he bought with my money.

He said they weren't posing, someone just happened to photograph the car. I asked why he was driving her around in the first place. He said they were going to meetings.

""What meetings?"" I asked. ""What business? Show me something. Show me anything real you've built in three years.""

He got angry then. Told me I was being controlling and that this was exactly why he couldn't succeed, because I was constantly questioning him and putting pressure on him instead of just trusting the process.

I logged into our joint bank account on my phone right there. I showed him the spreadsheet I'd been keeping. Every deposit I'd made, every expense of his I'd covered, every dollar of ""business investment"" I'd given him. $47,000 over three years, not counting the wedding money.

""I want to see the LLC paperwork,"" I said. ""I want to see the website. I want to see receipts for the $15,000 in business expenses from four months ago. Right now.""

He said he didn't have to prove anything to me.

I removed him from my bank account while standing there. Changed my passwords. Cancelled the credit card I'd given him for emergencies.

He started yelling. Said I was ruining everything, that he was so close to making it work. I asked again who Emma was.

""Fine,"" he said. ""We've been seeing each other. She actually believes in me.""

I asked how long.

""Eight months.""

Eight months. I'd been working doubles for eight months while he drove around in a Tesla with another woman.

I told him to get out. He said it was his apartment too. I said his name wasn't on the lease and he hadn't paid rent in three years so he could leave or I'd call the police.

He called me a bitch. Said I was just bitter because I was stuck in a dead-end job and couldn't handle him having ambition. Said Emma understood him in ways I never did. Then he grabbed his laptop and some clothes and left.

That was five days ago. Yesterday I got a text from a number I didn't recognize. It was Emma.

""He told me you kicked him out over nothing. He's staying with me now but he doesn't have access to any money because you froze him out. He needs his business funds returned.""

I didn't respond. An hour later, she sent another message.

""He says you owe him $47,000 for emotional damages and financial abuse. He's going to take you to court if you don't give it back.""

I blocked the number.

This morning my future mother-in-law called. She'd talked to her son. She said I was being cruel and vindictive, that I should be ashamed of myself for abandoning him when he needed support the most. She said Emma was a lovely girl who actually appreciated him.

I hung up on her.

My sister came over tonight with wine. She didn't say ""I told you so"" but I know she wanted to. We looked up Emma on social media. She's 24. Works at a yoga studio. Her Instagram is full of photos of her and my ex, going back seven months. Beach trips. Fancy restaurants. A weekend in Vegas.

All paid for with my money while I was pulling double shifts.

My sister asked what I was going to do. I said I didn't know. She said I should go after him legally for the money. I said I just wanted him gone and to move on with my life.

But now I keep thinking about the Tesla. About him threatening to sue me. About his mother saying I'm cruel. About three years of 70-hour weeks while he sat on the couch and planned his future with someone else.

My coworkers say I should let it go. That it's not worth the energy. But I gave him three years and $47,000 and he spent it on another woman.

Was I wrong to cut him off like that? Should I have handled it differently?",88,1764838875.0,FoundandExpose,46,0.9,False

——————
The Voicemail That Ends Everything
The house is too quiet.
Not the peaceful kind of quiet—the heavy, suffocating kind. The kind that presses against your ribs and waits for something to go wrong.
I stand in the center of my dining room, staring at the table I spent way too long decorating. Candles flicker against the crystal glasses, casting soft golden light across the silk dress I stupidly chose because I wanted tonight to feel special. Because ten years of marriage should mean something. Because I still believed in anniversaries and promises and the idea that love could grow instead of rot.
And because Theo said he'd try to be home ""by eight, latest.""
It's now 8:47.
I check my phone again, even though I don't know why. His message from earlier still sits there, crisp and sterile:
Running late. Big meeting. Don't wait up to eat.
I waited anyway.
Of course I did.
Champagne chills in the bucket beside me, tiny bubbles clinging to the glass like they're trying to hold on to hope too.
God, I'm pathetic.
I smooth a hand over my dress, forcing down the stupid flutter in my stomach. I know Theo. I know his brain works in deadlines and schedules and emergencies that always seem more urgent than us. He's not cruel—just consumed. And I've learned to live with the parts of him I can't change.
I pick up the bottle to pour myself a drink.
That's when my phone buzzes.
My first thought is relief. Finally. He's calling to say he's on his way, I can heat up the food, he'll walk through the door with that exhausted half-smile that still gets me. Maybe he even remembered the date.
The screen lights up.
Voicemail.From Theo.

Light. New. Fragile.
Confusion prickles down my arms. I don't know anyone with a newborn. Theo doesn't either. His coworkers all have older kids. His brother's children are teenagers.
A second cry pierces through the speaker.
Then the world stops.
Theo's voice—low, gentle, nothing like the clipped tone he uses with investors—fills my ear.

Daddy.
I replay it, hoping—begging—my ears are lying. My heart is sprinting so fast it feels like it's cracking against my ribs.
But the message plays exactly the same.
A woman cooing.A baby whimpering.Theo whispering comfort.
I don't realize I've dropped the champagne bottle until it hits the edge of the bucket, slips, and crashes onto the floor. Glass bursts across the tile. My phone slips from my hand and hits the ground with a hollow smack.
I don't pick it up.
I can't move.
The candlelight trembles. My vision blurs. The room feels warped—like I've stepped out of my life and into someone else's nightmare.
No tears. Not yet. Not even anger. Just a heavy, breath-stealing shock.
My husband—my husband—has a baby.
A baby with a name he said like it belongs to him.A baby he held.A baby crying in the background of his voicemail like she is part of his life. His world.
His child.
Not mine.
A sound leaves my throat—half gasp, half choke—but I clamp my hand over my mouth as if that can stop my world from falling apart.
I don't know how long I stand there. Seconds. Minutes. Hours. Time isn't real anymore.
My phone buzzes again.
Once.Twice.Then nonstop.
Buzz.Buzz.Buzzz—
The vibration jolts me back into my body. I finally kneel to grab it, my hands shaking so violently I drop it once before getting a grip.
Notifications flood the screen faster than I can register them.
Sabrina Vale posted a new video.You've been tagged in a post.Theo Hale trending #1 worldwide.BREAKING: THEO HALE SEEN AT HOSPITAL WITH NEWBORN—VIDEO INSIDE.
No.No, no, no.
My fingers go numb as I tap one of the links.
It opens instantly.
The video quality is too clear. Painfully clear. Someone was close—close enough to capture every intimate detail.
Theo stands in a hospital room, wearing a soft gray shirt I've washed a thousand times. His hair is messy in a way I've only ever seen after he's been running his hands through it.
And he's holding her.
The baby.
Tiny. Wrapped in a pink blanket. Her fist gripping the edge of his shirt like she knows him. Like she belongs to him.
Like he belongs to her.
Theo looks exhausted. Not corporate-exhausted. Something deeper. Something raw. Something I've never seen.
He rocks the baby gently, whispering something against her forehead. The camera zooms in. He presses the lightest ki-ss to her skin.
A woman—blurred, but visibly younger—rests against the pillow. Ivy Cross. I recognize her instantly. The face plastered across gossip accounts for weeks now. The girl people whispered about. The one with the pretty mouth and the reputation for ""getting involved"" with powerful men.
She looks toward Theo with damp eyes. Not seductive. Not smug. Just... worn down.
The room spins. My heart feels like it's being sliced open from the inside.
My thumb hits the edge of the screen and the video loops—Theo's soft ki-ss replaying again.
And again.And again.
My breath shudders out of me.
I stumble backward until I hit the wall. My shoulder knocks a picture frame off the shelf. It clatters to the floor, cracking down the center. I force myself to look.
It's a photo of us from three years ago. Theo lifting me onto his back on some beach trip his assistant forced him to take. I'm laughing. His eyes are on me, not the camera. It was one of the rare moments he wasn't consumed by work, by pressure, by everything heavy he carries inside.
I sink down beside the broken frame, hugging my knees, trying to breathe.
My phone buzzes again.
I glance at it.
Theo Hale (12 missed calls).Theo Hale (Message: ""Lila. Please pick up."")Miles Hale (1 missed call).Jace Rowe (Message: ""Call me. Now."")
Everything burns—my chest, my throat, my eyes.
My ten-year marriage ends in a thirty-second voicemail.
And the world knows before I do.
I press my forehead to my knees, but the buzzing doesn't stop. It gets louder. More frantic. Like the whole world has decided to witness my humiliation in real time.
Another wave of notifications explodes across my screen:
Sabrina Vale: ""This is insane. You guys—THE VIDEO. OMG.""BREAKING: WHO IS THE BABY'S MOTHER?Has Lila Hart been living a lie?
My hands curl into fists.
This isn't fair.This isn't real.This cannot be happening to me.
I force the air into my lungs, shaky and uneven. My chest feels too tight, my body too small to hold this much pain.
The last time Theo and I talked, we argued about schedules. About how he promised to take a weekend off and didn't. About how I felt invisible, and he said I was being ""dramatic.""
If only I'd known.
If only I'd listened to the ache in my gut instead of brushing it aside and telling myself he was just stressed.
My phone lights up again.
Another voicemail.From him.
I stare at the screen like it might explode.
I can't listen.I can't hear his voice again.Not after the last one destroyed me.
The champagne on the floor is spreading, soaking into the cracks of the tile. The room smells like sweetness and broken glass.
My silk dress suddenly feels stupid. Too tight. Too hopeful.
I stand. My legs almost buckle. I lean against the table for balance.
The candles flicker harder now, shadows moving across the walls like ghosts I didn't invite.
I grab my phone with trembling fingers and scroll, desperate for something—anything—to anchor me. But every notification hits me like a slap.
The internet knows.His company knows.Reporters know.Strangers know.
Everyone knows.
Except me.His wife.
A hot tear slips down my cheek. The first one. I wipe it away quickly, but more come. Quiet. Angry. Devastated.
I grip the back of the chair and breathe through the shaking.
This isn't a crack in the foundation.It's an earthquake.
My phone vibrates again.Then again.Then again.
It doesn't stop.
A part of me wants to smash it against the wall just to make the noise go away.
But I don't.
Because if I do, I'll never know the next truth waiting to ambush me.
I finally unlock the screen.
A final notification sits at the top.
Trending: #PrayForLila
My stomach turns.
I'm not dead.
But maybe my marriage is.
I look around the room—at the candles, the champagne, the stupid anniversary decorations I put up like a hopeful idiot—and I do something I haven't done in a long, long time.
I exhale.
Slow.Broken.Final.
Then I turn off the candles.Step over the glass.Walk to my bedroom.
And close the door on the life I thought I had.
Because nothing—absolutely nothing—will ever be the same again.
The Internet Eats Its Queen
Lila
By morning, the internet has already eaten me alive.
My face—the hollow-eyed, she-ll-shocked version of me standing alone in my dining room—is now a meme, a GIF, a trending template for jokes I never asked to be part of.
I shouldn't look.I know I shouldn't.But my fingers betray me every time.
WHEN YOU FIND OUT YOU'RE THE PROBLEM, NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER
WHEN YOUR MAN HAS MORE NDAs THAN EMOTIONS
WHEN YOU ORDER A HUSBAND ON AMAZON BUT GET A BABY-DADDY SURPRISE PACK
People are... talented. Awful, but talented.
I toss my phone onto the couch and drag a blanket tighter around my shoulders, wishing it were a shield big enough to block the entire world. It still smells faintly like Theo—clean soap and something expensive—but I force myself not to think about that.
My house is dim except for the pale morning light squeezing through the blinds. I haven't opened the curtains. I'm not stupid. Paparazzi are probably outside like raccoons waiting for trash night.
My stomach twists.
Trash.That's what I feel like.Leftovers of the life I thought I had.
The door slams open hard enough to rattle the windows.
Mara.
Of course.
""I come bearing vengeance, carbs, and accessories for murder,"" she announces before she even steps fully inside.
In her right hand? A dozen donuts.In her left? A baseball bat.
I blink. ""Please tell me that's for emotional support.""
""It's for cracking skulls,"" she says cheerfully, kicking the door shut with her foot. ""Where is he? Where is that filthy, two-timing, billionaire sewage rat? I'll go feral.""
""You can't commit homicide before I've had coffee.""
""Watch me."" She tosses the donut box onto the coffee table, rounds the couch, and drops beside me. ""Oh my god."" Her face softens. ""You look like you were hit by a Black Friday sale.""
""Thanks.""
""Oh, sweetheart..."" Mara pulls me into a hug before I can dodge. ""You deserve better. And by better, I mean a man who doesn't have a surprise baby popping out like an unwanted plot twist.""
I snort into her shoulder. ""Plot twist implies the story was well-written.""
She squeezes tighter. ""Say the word and I'll drive over to his company and TP the headquarters.""
""No.""
""Okay, egg his house?""
""No.""
""Slash his tires? Just one. I'm not a monster.""
I pull back enough to look at her. ""Mara.""
""What? I have a baseball bat and rage. Let me be useful.""
I manage a tiny laugh. It feels strange—like my face forgot how to make the shape—but it's still something.
My phone buzzes under the blanket.
Mara's eyes sharpen. ""Is that him?""
I don't answer.
She prowls across the couch, snatches the phone, and squints at the screen. ""Thirty-eight missed calls? Is he deranged? Does he think you're going to pick up and say, 'Hey babe, sorry I missed your earlier voicemail about the INFANT?'""
I bury my face in my hands. ""I don't know what to do.""
""Yes, you do,"" she says simply.
""No, I really don't.""
""Fine. Then do nothing. Honestly, nothing sounds perfect. Therapeutic, even."" She flips my phone upside down and slides it under a pillow like she's tucking away a bomb. ""I'm invoking a strict ignore-the-man-child rule.""
""He's not a man-child.""
Mara snorts. ""Sweetheart, the man has a hidden baby with a woman who still looks like she's waiting for her college ID to expire.""
I wince. ""Ivy looks older than that.""
""She looks like she sprained something trying to say photosynthesis."" Mara crosses her arms. ""And don't defend her. She slept with your husband.""
My throat tightens. ""He slept with her.""
Mara softens. ""Yeah. He did.""
The room sinks into quiet.
There's something humiliating about grief. Not the dramatic kind you can shout or cry through—no, the quiet kind. The kind that sinks under your ribcage until you feel hollow, like someone carved you out and forgot to leave anything behind.
I curl deeper into the blanket. ""I don't understand how I didn't know. How did he hide a baby from me?""
""Because men are terrible.""
""That's not an explanation.""
""It's the only explanation."" Mara taps my forehead. ""He hid it. Deliberately. Purposefully. With full awareness his wife—you—would be shattered.""
My voice cracks. ""I don't understand why.""
""You will,"" she says. ""Once we peel the skin off his lies.""
I choke out a laugh. ""Please stop talking like you're the villain of a Disney movie.""
""No promises.""
She grabs a donut and thrusts it into my hand. ""Eat. Sugar stabilizes emotional devastation. It's science.""
I nibble the corner like an exhausted squirrel.
She beams. ""Look at you. Consuming carbs. I'm so proud.""
Another notification buzzes somewhere under the pillow.
Mara's expression ices over. ""If that's Theo, I'm going to block his number with my aura.""
I bury my face in the blanket. ""Please don't say aura.""
""Oh, I'll say aura. I'll say it aggressively.""
""You're exhausting.""
""And yet, you love me.""
She leans forward to grab the remote and turns on the TV. Bad idea. The screen lights up with a news anchor announcing:
""The Hale Baby Scandal continues to dominate social media—""
""Nope,"" Mara says, lunging forward to change the channel so fast she nearly unplugs the TV. ""Absolutely not. We're not letting toxic sludge into our eyeballs.""
I rub my temples. ""The fact that they're calling it the Hale Baby Scandal makes me want to walk into traffic.""
""Well, technically it's accurate.""
""Mara.""
""Too soon. Got it.""
My phone buzzes again—an aggressive, demanding vibration that doesn't stop.
""I swear if he calls fifty times, I'm hexing him,"" she mutters.
I sigh. ""One more call won't change anything.""
""No,"" she says gently, ""but answering him could.""
I swallow hard. ""I'm not ready to hear his voice.""
Mara takes my hand. ""Then you don't. Not until you want to. Not until he deserves it.""
My eyes sting, but tears don't fall. They feel lodged somewhere deeper. Heavier.
We sit there for a while. Me, wrapped in a blanket. Mara, holding a bat and a donut. The two stages of womanhood.
And then the TV flashes with a notification banner.
A trending alert.
Another.
And another.
Mara narrows her eyes. ""What the he-ll is hitting the internet now?""
Before I can stop her, she grabs my phone from under the pillow and unlocks it.
Her entire body goes rigid.
""What?"" I whisper.
""Oh... oh, you're gonna want to see this."" She turns the phone around.
The notification at the top reads:
Sabrina Vale uploaded a new video:THE HALE BABY SCANDAL — WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
My stomach drops through the floor.
Mara lets out a low whistle. ""Welp. There it is. The world is about to take your private life, put it in a blender, and add subtitles.""
I stare at the screen until the letters blur.
I'm not breathing.I'm not blinking.I'm not ready.
Mara puts the phone down gently, as if it's a detonator.
""Lila..."" her voice softens. ""You don't have to watch it right now.""
But I already know I will.
Because whatever Sabrina posted—whatever she claims happened—it's going to spread fast.Faster than the voicemail.Faster than the memes.Faster than my heart can catch up.
I inhale sharply, but it doesn't feel like air reaches my lungs.
Mara leans forward, ready to fight the whole world for me. ""You're not alone. I'm here. And if Sabrina lies, I swear on my future unborn children, I'm doxxing her.""
""Mara—""
""Try me.""
But I can't answer.Because everything in my life has already exploded...and somehow, this feels like the match.
I look at the screen one more time.
THE HALE BABY SCANDAL — WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
My blood runs cold.
The world is about to rewrite my story without asking my permission.
And I'm not sure I'm strong enough to watch.
Billionaire on Fire
Theo
My life is burning.
Not figuratively. Literally. My PR team is melting down in real time on a thirty-foot screen while my CFO swears he can ""hear investors sharpening their knives.""
I stand in the center of my office—top floor, glass walls, a panoramic view of the city that doesn't feel impressive anymore—and rub the bridge of my nose hard enough to bruise.
On one screen:News channels looping the same thirty-second video like it's a paid advertisement.
On another:Emails from the board demanding emergency meetings.
On a third:Lila's face.Frozen. Pale. Broken.
That picture is the one I can't look at for more than a second without feeling like my lungs collapse.
""Okay,"" Jace says, pacing so aggressively the carpet might start smoking. ""Okay, okay—let's list priorities so I don't have a stroke."" He lifts a shaky finger. ""One: Contain the media. Two: Issue a statement. Three: Pray the stock doesn't nosedive. Four: Figure out whether you want to live or if I should put you out of your misery now.""
He looks at me like I'm the one who set the building on fire.
Maybe I did.
I drag a hand through my hair. ""This didn't need to happen like this.""
""No,"" he snaps. ""It needed to happen privately, quietly, months ago when I told you to tell her before the universe did it for you. But here we are. Universe: one. Theo: negative twelve.""
I don't argue. He's right.And I hate that he's right.
My phone hasn't stopped buzzing since last night.Lila hasn't answered once.
Thirty-eight calls, twenty messages, five voicemails from me—all ignored.
My chest tightens with panic I don't allow myself to show. Not in front of the board. Not in front of the world. But Jace sees the crack in my composure anyway.
He sighs and stops pacing. ""Theo... it's bad out there.""
He gestures toward the window. Down below, the front gates of my home are swarmed with paparazzi—camera flashes like lightning, voices shouting my name as if I owe them something. They camped out all night. They'll be here all day.
I can't even go home.I can't get to my wife.I can't fix anything.
""Has she seen the video?"" I ask, even though I already know the answer.
Jace looks at me like he wants to punch me too. ""Everyone on the planet has seen the video.""
My stomach twists. ""Lila didn't deserve any of this.""
""No sh-it.""
I inhale slowly, forcing the breath to actually reach my lungs. ""I need to talk to her.""
""You need to handle your PR crisis before the investors throw you into a volcano.""
I shoot him a glare.
He holds up both hands. ""I'm just saying—your entire empire is about to crumble, and also your marriage is in shambles, and also the world thinks you're the father of the year while simultaneously calling you the world's worst husband. It's complicated.""
I try not to punch a window.
Jace grabs the remote and flips the channel. ""Here. Look at this.""
The screen changes to Sabrina Vale—a woman who built her entire career on spilling celebrity blood in soft lighting and great makeup.
She's sitting in a chair, leaning toward the camera with predatory excitement.
My stomach drops.
""Turn it off,"" I mutter.
""No. You need to see how bad it is.""
I grit my teeth as Sabrina begins:
""The Hale Baby Scandal—yes, we're calling it that—is spiraling faster than any story this year. And the real question is... what did Lila Hart know? Was she blindsided? Or was she covering for him?""
My jaw clenches so hard it aches. ""She didn't know anything.""
Jace nods. ""We know that. The world doesn't.""
Sabrina keeps going, milking every second of my collapse.
""Sources say Theo Hale has been secretly visiting the child for months—""
""That's not true."" My voice is sharp enough to cut glass. ""I saw her twice. Twice. Both times were emergencies.""
""I know,"" Jace says. ""But once a rumor starts—""
""—it becomes truth,"" I finish bitterly.
My temples throb. My hands shake. Every regret I've been burying for months claws its way back to the surface.
""There has to be a way to fix this,"" I say.
Jace gives me a look that says even he doesn't believe that. ""Your only fix is Lila.""
My breath halts.
""She needs to hear the truth from you,"" he continues. ""But you waited too long. And now the truth has a trending hashtag.""
I close my eyes because for once in my life, I don't have an answer.Not for the board.Not for the public.Not for her.
Especially not for her.
""I shouldn't have sent that voicemail,"" I mutter.
""You didn't mean to send it.""
""That doesn't matter. She heard it. She heard everything.""
He falls silent.
I walk to my desk, pick up my phone, and scroll through my voicemail list. The one she heard sits at the top, mocking me.
I press play.
The moment my voice comes through the speaker—soft, quiet, the voice I only ever use when I'm trying to be gentle—I feel sick.
""It's okay, Thea. Daddy's here.""
I flinch.
Hearing it now is worse than it was then. Because I know exactly how it sounded to Lila.Like love.Like devotion.Like betrayal wrapped in a lullaby.
Jace watches me silently, jaw tight.
I pause the recording halfway through, unable to listen anymore. ""I never wanted her to find out like this.""
""You didn't want her to find out at all,"" Jace says quietly. ""That's the problem.""
I shove the phone away. ""I was trying to protect her.""
""No."" His voice is firm. ""You were trying to protect yourself.""
I want to deny it. Argue. Fight.But he's right.
I was scared.Scared she'd leave.Scared she'd look at me differently.Scared that the one good thing in my life—Lila—would slip out of my hands.
And now she has.
The phone rings again.
Not Lila.Miles.
Great.
I ignore it.
The phone rings again.
Jace raises a brow. ""You should answer that.""
""He's going to scream at me.""
""Probably.""
""He's going to threaten me.""
""Definitely.""
""He's going to call me every synonym for idiot in the dictionary.""
Jace shrugs. ""He's not wrong.""
I glare at him.
But before I can pick up, the office door slams open with enough force to shake the glass wall.
Miles.
Perfectly tailored suit.Perfectly combed hair.Perfectly furious.
""Are you out of your mind?"" he snaps.
Jace mutters, ""Here we go,"" and backs away slowly like he's avoiding friendly fire.
Miles doesn't wait for permission to enter. He storms up to me, eyes blazing, chest heaving like he sprinted all the way here.
""You. Absolute. Moron.""
""Good to see you too,"" I say dryly.
He grabs my shirt. Actually grabs it. ""Do you have any idea what you've done to her?""
My jaw tightens. ""I know.""
""No, you don't. Because if you did, you'd be crawling through broken glass to get to her, not standing in this office behind your godda-mn fortress of screens.""
""I can't get to her,"" I snap. ""There are paparazzi everywhere.""
""Climb a fence. Dig a tunnel. Teleport."" His voice cracks with rage. ""You don't let her be alone right now.""
I swallow hard. ""She won't answer my calls.""
Miles releases me with a shove. ""Well, she sure as he-ll isn't going to answer after that voicemail.""
Jace winces. ""Oof.""
Miles rounds on him. ""You—stop making commentary.""
""Right. Muted. Got it.""
Miles turns back to me. His voice lowers, but the fury in his eyes is nuclear. ""Fix it.""
""I'm trying,"" I say.
""Try harder.""
""I don't know how.""
Miles' nostrils flare. ""Then figure it out.""
He steps closer, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. ""Because if you hurt her again—if you make her cry one more time—I swear to God, Theo...""
Before I can respond, before I can even breathe—His fist swings.
Fast.Sharp.Unrestrained.
It connects with my jaw so hard my head snaps to the side.
Pain shoots down my neck.The room goes quiet.Jace curses somewhere behind me.
I steady myself with a hand on the desk.
Miles wipes his knuckles on his sleeve, expression unbothered. ""That's for Lila.""
I touch my jaw and taste blood.
I deserve it.
I know I do.
He steps back, breathing hard. ""Now get your sh-it together.""
The door slams behind him.
Jace stares at me. ""Well... on the bright side, that's the least physical pain you're going to feel this week.""
I don't answer.
Because all I can think about is Lila—her silence, her pain, her face when she heard that voicemail.
I look out the window again.

1pdv8vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1pdv8vn/new_diagnosis/,New diagnosis,"Hey everyone, so I’ve recently been diagnosed. Which started with pregnancy, although now I’m putting everything together I do think I’ve possibly had this for years, even as a child too. 
I’ve struggled with constant tiredness forever. No matter how many hours sleep I get I never feel fresh or ready for the day. This is something I would love advice on because it affects me the most. I’ve read somewhere as soon as you wake up to just get up and not go back to sleep? I’ve always napped throughout my whole life because I’ve always physically needed to or I hardly function. 
What other tips do you have you’ve found work? 
I am a coffee lover and I do vape which I’m guessing are going to make me worse, but they’re the only little pleasures I have in life haha. (I did stop throughout pregnancy with both, but I don’t think it really made any difference)
The other main symptom I have is dizziness quite regularly and I’ve started feeling more nauseous. Does anybody take electrolytes? Recommend brands? 
I’m a new first time mum so I think this whole experience of being a mum has been so much harder having this and I want to not have to worry and I especially don’t want to ever faint while holding my baby etc. (luckily I’ve not ever fainted) 
I’m quite upset that I’ve been diagnosed really. Happy I know what it is however I thought it was just simply low iron that could be fixed and I’m hoping I don’t feel this way forever. Not being able to do much physically with my baby without feeling like crap. I feel quite useless at the moment. 
But I’m open to any and every tip because I’m starting from scratch and I have no idea what will help me now that I know what it is. Also what are some other symptoms that don’t get talked about much? I read one of them being that you feel unstable on your feet and feeling like you’re going to fall all the time and this is something I’ve experienced for the past couple of years which randomly come out of nowhere. 
And apparently seeing black speckles in vision. I’m not sure if some symptoms go into remission or if that’s not how it works but I’ve also had years of unexplained diarrhoea every single day which has subsided now after roughly 3 years overnight, no changes or anything just randomly stopped one day and never come back, but I wonder if that was also why I had that for so long. 
I suppose I’m just kind of overwhelmed because I’m piecing so many things together and I feel like it all links into this diagnosis but I could be overthinking.

I used \`xev\` and can verify that indeed the key event is not appearing at all. Also, if I plug an external keyboard it works fine.

However, if I press them too hard for a long period of time, it seems like they ""wake up"" and they start working almost perfectly (all key presses go through), until they stop again when I stop pressing them.

Now, during those past 5y I almost certainly spilled coffee on that keyboard. However all the other keys are working fine, it's just those 3 or 4 keys that have the issue.

I removed the keycaps and cleaned them from below, but this did not help. Should I be looking to replace my keyboard assembly (I'll do it my own I think) or are there any other intermediate steps I could take before I go all the way to keyboard replacement?

Sci-Fi, Comedy, Stream of Consciousness. 5,023 words.)

Perhaps it is selfish of me to tell the truth at this point. Perhaps all the legends and myths about me, no matter how unnecessarily flattering, serve their purpose. Alas, I am an old man now - an old man who wants to sit in the grass and tell a story.

You’ve probably heard some rumor or other, but honestly, it doesn’t matter who I was before that fateful day I went to Goodwill. I barely remember myself and care even less. What I do recollect from is having some loose time in my day to go to the local thrift store and browse their fantastic wares.

It is impossible to know what I was looking for. No one goes to a thrift store knowing what they’ll get, they just vaguely hope they’ll find something that’ll irrevocably change everything for the better forever. Luckily, that’s exactly what happened to me. I remember wandering the aisles perusing the various objects on display; a Mickey Mouse alarm clock with faded plastic, a VHS copy of “Homeward Bound: Revelations” repaired with duct tape, a child’s science fair project that could’ve been mine for the low, low price of seventeen dollars.

It is a testament to the power of The Correct Item that it would stand out amongst this embarrassment of riches. In my minds eye I remember it levitating there, bobbing and rotating in midair emanating a golden aura alongside a gentle, angelic harmony. Of course, as you all know, I am prone to my romantic revisionisms and flights of fancy; like most inanimate home goods, it was probably just sitting there on the shelf.

Regardless, I stumbled towards it arms outstretched, mouth agape, heart racing and refusing to believe the evidence of my eyes until I held The Correct Item in my hands. This was it! The one missing piece in my life that would forever change everything evermore. A masterful blend of form and function, The Correct Item offered a plethora of practical utility while evoking a design sensibility that all at once nodded towards the Classical and Baroque but at the same time seemed thoroughly modern, maybe even with a futuristic flair. It would be impossible not to admire it for its otherworldly beauty while engaging with its myriad of uses. And incredibly, it was only five dollars more than what I had valued it in my head.

The Correct Item fit perfectly into that little, awkward nook in my apartment where nothing else seemed to fit. And like the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle sliding into place, my whole apartment came into a singular focus upon its installation; a harmonious, unified bow with The Correct Item as the knot at the center.

The effects of The Correct Item were immediate. With it in my possession, I started waking up not just on time but at a time that allowed me the space before work to eat a healthy breakfast, read a little, and sit outside admiring the morning dew while enjoying a cup of coffee. At work, I suddenly had extraordinary ideas regarding customer satisfaction, project workflows, operational procedures, and even HR practices that would satisfy employees and management alike. My relationships flourished. I easily charmed and ingratiated myself amongst even the most prickly of strangers. Friendships that I had maintained since childhood that had seemingly plateaued all of sudden went a level deeper. The dead end relationship I was in was able to be resolved in a graceful and mature manner where we remained amicable and we even introduced each other to our subsequent partners. And not to mention I was better at sex than ever before, reaching #1 on the local leaderboards.

All were in awe when I had guests over. “Wherever did you get this!?” they would exclaim in amazement and I would chuckle in response, swirling my spaghetti martini in one hand, “Oh, I just picked it up somewhere. Unfortunately, they don’t make things like this anymore.” My guests would rush online, trying any avenue to purchase a Correct Item for themselves, but alas, they only encountered scam posts and cheap knockoffs that were either comically and uselessly small, or branded with the logos of pop punk bands we’re all too embarrassed to admit we liked at some point or another, or made with MDF treated with a chemical that caused migraines and was prone to spontaneous combustion. Years later, historians would discover the company that made The Correct Item went bankrupt after their warehouse containing their entire stock was swallowed by a sinkhole caused by a nearby fracking operation. They never bothered picking up the only surviving unit that was on display at a mall some 90 miles away.

Word spread about my marvelous possession. Friends and family would find any reason to drop by. Curious neighbors would ring my doorbell and sheepishly ask to see it. After excusing myself to the bathroom, I caught the local reverend, who had turned up demanding to see what his flock was buzzing about, giving The Correct Item a big kiss. A mother running for the PTA board requested to have a photo op with it. After a groundswell of support due to the photo she changed her slogan to “Samantha Scarlett - The CORRECT Choice.” She won in a landslide with a voter turnout that, up until that point, was record setting not just for the local level but statewide as well.

Over the years, people have asked me about this period of time, “Weren’t you concerned that people were using you just to get to The Correct Item?” Each time I would laugh heartily, slap my hand on their shoulder and give them a sympathetic, yet pitying, look. They didn’t get it! And perhaps you don’t either, so I will lay it all down here - the quality of goods you buy are a direct reflection of who you are as a person. And The Correct Item, with its rich mahogany inlays, sturdy construction, and comprehensive Bluetooth connectivity, was simply the best purchase anyone has ever made. People came to conflate, rightly so, the durability, beauty, and usefulness of The Correct Item with the richness of my moral character. Not to mention the fact that I bought it at a thrift shop showed a thorough comprehension of commercial, economic, and mercantile matters. As such, I started to become a leader of the community. People would come to me for advice regarding love and life, squabblers would show up seeking arbitration, politicians would come seeking guidance on their various policies and upcoming votes. And I was correct in all things.

I didn’t really quite grasp the influence my object and I exhibited until the night it was almost stolen from me. Certainly, you know the story - it is but one of the many myths and legends repeated to school children about me - but please, indulge an old man for a moment.

I remember the man. He had the unfortunate name of Alan Rickman, forever living in the shadow of someone he had nothing to do with but happened to share a name with. He was a friend of a friend of a friend and one day accompanied one of that train to my apartment. He stood agape in the presence of The Correct Item, never tearing his gaze away from it while his friends and I talked. As goodbyes were underway, he let out a desperate and meek, “Can I touch it?” His friends laughed at him and told him to stop being weird. I gave them a scornful look and then smiled benevolently, “Of course, you can.” He ran forward like a child and clasped the giant dial on the front of The Correct Item with both hands and twisted it, gasping and giggling with each resonant, metallic clang from the inner workings of the mechanism. After three turns of the dial, I sternly let him know that was enough. I was trying to be kind and was unaware the effect of such a privilege would have on him.

Later that night, Alan Rickman was caught scaling the side of my apartment building with a burlap sack containing a crowbar and a sledgehammer. It is hotly contested to this day whether he meant to steal The Correct Item or to destroy it. The people that caught him were a self-styled band of vigilantes calling themselves The Disciples of the Correct Item, and they had taken upon themselves to watch over me and my home. This was the first I’d ever heard of them. I suppose I should’ve been more aware of the sudden uptick of hooded figures sulking about my neighborhood but I chalked it up to flowing crimson robes with gold fringe being back in style again, fashion being cyclical and all that.

The Disciples quickly apprehended Alan Rickman, who was no master thief. As three of them wrestled the poor man to the ground, the rest started forming a makeshift podium out in the middle of the street of whatever they could find. A hot-wired RV made up the main platform and piled around it were various garbage cans, lawn ornaments, and pulled up shrubbery. The end result was less stage and more pyre.

Three Disciples stood atop the RV with a restrained Alan Rickman while the rest formed a semicircle around the base of the pyre, anonymous in their crimson, hooded robes. One on top of the stage blew a strange horn to summon the surrounding community. It sounded like the dying cry of a long gone creature. This is what woke me up and I assumed the same of everyone else - that everyone was coming out to investigate the strange sound. I was wrong about that.

For maybe the only time ever, I had to ignore the Morning Printout coming out of The Correct Item and rushed outside. A large crowd had accumulated around the RV and Disciples were whipping them into a fury.

“Thief!” Shouted some.

“Desecrator!” shouted others.

A man crawled onto some of the garbage cans in front of the crowd. He was well dressed and had a naturally commanding presence about him. The crowd hushed as he raised his arms.

“I’ve been a civil rights advocate my whole life. I’ve defended the rights of everyone and anyone to the fullest extent of my abilities. For I believed in the rights of all no matter the circumstances.” He gestured towards Alan Rickman. “I no longer believe in such things. We should cut off this guy’s hands.” The crowd roared and undulated with eager justice. Torches were being lit and handed out. An enterprising opportunist was selling t-shirts commemorating the event and the biggest man you’ve ever seen pushed his way to the front of the crowd, holding an equally enormous axe in both hands. He climbed to the top of the RV in three large bounds and his silhouette blotted out the morning sun as his thick, hairy arms raised his ax over a trembling Alan Rickman.

“Stop!” I cried out from the front door of my apartment building and another hush came over the crowd. I looked out over the sea of unwavering stares and stepped forth. The people parted before me as I made my way. I clumsily climbed on top of the garbage cans and patio furniture before scrambling onto the roof of the RV. “Release this man at once,” I said through heavy breaths, exhausted from my ascent.

The Lead Disciple faced towards me; lit torch held at an angle above her head. An unnatural darkness obscured her face and made it hard to see her expressions. The huge man, ax held high and trembling as if only held back by a hair trigger, stared at me through the slits in the black sack covering his head. A tense silence permeated the air.

“The Proprietor… has chosen… MERCY!” the lead hooded woman bellowed in a sickly rasp and the crowd once again erupted in pandemonium, this time in revelry and celebration. Alan Rickman was unshackled and he fell to my feet, crying and clutching my legs. I picked him up and embraced him, demonstrating how I regarded him as an equal. He wound up becoming one of my closest friends, confidants, and personal advisors.

But of course, you know who Alan Rickman was. He was the general I put in charge to lead the campaign to retake Eastern Europe during The Unbeliever Uprising.

Soon afterwards I asked the Disciples of The Correct Item to disband, mostly because of their strange, alarming, and completely unwarranted behavior. I tried to be polite about it but they still seemed pretty upset and embarrassed. I think it was all these guys really had going on.

A few years later, I saw that huge guy working at a pet store somewhere in Beaverton, Oregon (yes, the stories are true! There WAS a Beaverton, Oregon and it was every bit as magical as you were told and more! Shame about that asteroid, though). He was pretty easy to recognize due to his immense size and the fact that he was still wearing that sack over his head and the same black tunic cinched at the waist with a bloodstained, tattered rope. After a few awkward hey-so-good-to-see-yous, we chatted for a bit and caught each other up on our lives. He explained that times were rough ever since the market for cultish executioners had dried up and he was forced to find other work, although he was doing alright now. I commiserated and told him about how so incredibly busy I was ever since several democratic governments capitulated to my growing influence. Once the pleasantries were exchanged, I relayed my need for a “lil’ somethin’-somethin’” for Goldfish Fridays down at the roller rink and he was more than helpful in helping me find exactly what I was looking for.

“Hey,” he called out to me as I was leaving, one foot out the door. I turned and he continued, “Those were some good times, huh?”

He was probably talking about the event with the Disciples (in which case, I think he was being overly sentimental and sappy over something that was actually a troubling display of what happens when men don’t have hobbies and healthy, offline communities; also, the whole thing lasted, like, five minutes, tops) however overall there was a spirit of optimism and hopefulness that swept the world. As people heard of my messianic figure and the cool thing I bought at Goodwill, they took to the streets to beg their leaders to become part of my new world order. In a country once called The United States of America, an unremarkable nation disregarded by history, a nationwide ballot measure was cast to strip their government of power and hand it all to me. The result was nearly unilateral in my favor and when questioned, the naysayers were horrified to realize they were holding their ballots upside down and not only did they against me, they had voted “Yes” on the referendum to make all the birds louder. One by one, all the countries of the world followed suite. For the first time in history, all the guns fell silent, all the mouths were fed, and all of mankind was able to join hands and be united under a single banner in peace and harmony in the name of The Correct Item.

Except for the Unbeliever Uprising, I forgot about that. Fuck, that was a nasty affair. Thank god for Alan Rickman.

Under my leadership, Earth entered a worldwide golden age. I ruled with utmost fairness and kindness for the entire populace with The Correct Item at my side, its Goodwill price sticker still stuck on one of its various levers. On the rare occasion two factions would come at odds with each other, and the mere sight of The Correct Item wasn’t able to qualm their quarrels, I was able to present hidden third options that satiated all parties involved. Earth became one economy. All of the planet’s resources were allocated appropriately and technology advanced in leaps and bounds to the point it resembled what would’ve been called “magic” a mere ten years ago and the word “impossible” fell out of use in the common vernacular. As a result of this monumental progress, Earth was more than prepared for the Calcinthinoid Incursion.

A scientist at SETI had one day entered the rough dimensions of The Correct Item as the frequency bandwidth the gigantic dish was currently receiving and had picked up subspace chatter from an unknown source. The messages were spoken in their alien language, which really just sounded like English but as if bugs were speaking it.

“The puny Earthlings are no match for our might! They are ripe for harvesting!” said one voice.

“Prepare the fleet at once!” said another.

“No need to rush!” screeched a third, “There’s no force in the galaxy that’d unite a planet quickly enough to resist our forces! We can use this time to learn to play the instruments we always wanted but never got around to!”

“I don’t know, I always get a little sad thinking about learning an instrument at my age,” responded the second alien, interspersing the clauses with an animalistic chittering, “It makes me feel like I’ve squandered the neuroplasticity of my youth.”

“Listen, nothing can get back the time we’ve already spent, but as the saying goes - the best time to plant a xinblorp was twenty cycles ago; the second best time is now. Let’s just do what makes us happy in the here and now and then we can go crush the weakling humans!”

Of course, the Calcinthinoids were working off of outdated information and when the invasion force arrived, the hammer of their armada smashed against the anvil of our planetary defense forces. While the Calcinthinoids were watching tutorial videos and plucking along to rudimentary melodies, Earth built up a vast, interconnected network of Orbital Hypernuclear Missile Platforms and Automated Plasma Railgun Stations, all backed up with carrier dreadnoughts, each capable of deploying 10,000 fighter craft. All these planetary fortifications were centralized in the ionosphere above the apartment where I still lived with The Correct Item.

The battle, still unnamed as historians argue whether it should sound really cool or somber and important, lasted for three days. The soldiers of the Calcinthinoid Empire, having never known defeat, fought fiercely. But they had come up against something they’ve never encountered. Something unstoppable. Something impervious to any weapon. For in every human there lies a fundamental truth that they’re willing to fight and to die for. You know what it is. It’s what we all say every night before bed. It is what every mother whispers to their newborn infant. It is what all schoolchildren say as they pledge allegiance to the human race every morning. Say it with me now.

“Somewhere out there is an item available for purchase that will change my life for the better.”

You know, I shouldn’t have mandated that children pledge allegiance to the human race. That was a strange thing to do.

Did you know this battle is where the Rings of Earth come from? It’s true. In the years following the battle, all the debris coalesced in an orbit around the equator. It may look beautiful from the inner atmosphere, but if you were to take a stratopod to the edges of our atmosphere you’d see the aftermath of those terrible few days; remains of spaceships floating lifelessly, bodies drifting among unexploded and unstable ordnance rendered too unsafe to retrieve, endless amounts of Calcinthinoid equivalents of Squire brand guitars. It is a sobering sight. But it is a ring we wear proudly. For if you look at Earth from anywhere in known space, you can see us wearing the symbol of our galactic superiority.

Humanity chased the routed Calcinthinoid fleet all the way back to their homeworld (coincidentally also called “Earth,” but, you know, like a bug would say it). It was only a matter of hours between establishing orbital supremacy and our quantum marines raising the Earth flag above the bombed-out structure of the Theocractic World Parliament of Calcinthin. As it were, at the moment of death Calcinthinoids would telepathically transmit the last sight they would ever see to the rest of their kind. So heavy were their losses, the entire species was almost constantly bombarded with the image of The Correct Item, a silhouette of which was stenciled upon the tail fins of our interplanetary cruisers and fighter craft. By the time we had boots on the ground, large swaths of the Calcinthinoid population had defected from their hectocentennial theocratic hegemony and begged our troopers for any information about The Correct Item.

I designed the Earth flag, by the way. I chose to represent Earth with a picture of Earth I found on Google Images. Next to it is a picture of The Correct Item I took with my phone, with my apartment fully visible in the background as I never really learned how to mask items in Photoshop. Underneath both of these pictures is the word “Earth!” in a neat typeface I found on dafont.com.

Having defeated the predominant force in the galaxy, Earth was now known as the prevailing regional power and all the civilizations and planets that suffered under Calcinthinoid rule flocked to ingratiate themselves, offering tribute to myself and The Correct Item. My apartment became the nexus of all political and commercial activity in all the known galaxy, much to the dismay of my landlord who tried to argue that intergalactic dignitaries and their entourages violated the provisions in the lease that stipulate that guests can only stay 3 days and pets weren’t allowed. A judge found his complaints frivolous and took the time to state that the comments regarding pets was xenophobic towards the Bloogians, who looked and acted like golden retrievers wearing top hats. After he lost the lawsuit, my landlord swore that he’d never rent an apartment to an intergalactic emperor ever again.

Peace and prosperity reigned throughout the Milky Way for over a century. I could bore you with the ins and outs of this period and the responsibilities bestowed upon a man of my station - managing hyperspace trade routes, dictating which planetary systems belonged to which spacefaring consortium, unmasking myself as a surprise guest in televised singing competitions - but what is important in my story is that eventually my star started to fall.

I was invited to be a guest of honor at a science symposium on a planet called q’Lanthenurp (but, you know, like how a bug would say it). I’d been to many functions and had stopped caring about them long ago, but in recent years it seemed like the flow of prestigious invitations had been stymied. My closest advisors, at least the ones who remained after all this time, begged me not to go.

“Your excellency,” they cried, “There’s no need for you to attend such a lowly and dangerous event as a science symposium!” I gently held up a bony, weathered hand to silence them. It had been a while since I was invited anywhere. I didn’t even notice they didn’t ask for the presence of The Correct Item.

I was a bit shocked to be seated so far in the back, and with a pillar blocking any possible sight of the main stage. Seated next to me was a Loplolian eating a hot dog. I eyed it hungrily, realizing my travel schedule hadn’t allowed me the chance for a bite in quite a while, an unfair burden on a man my age; at that point the oldest human to have ever lived. I leaned towards the Loplolian and asked, “Hey bud, where’d you get the hot dog?” I forgot that Loplolians take their time in responding to any inquiry. A simple answer to “How are you?” might take one upwards of a week for it to consider all the possible angles of response. Its mouth hung agape and all four hands clasped the hot dog tightly as its brow furrowed in immense thought. Meanwhile, onstage, someone suggested a way to reverse the effects of that disastrous referendum all those years ago and make the birds quieter once again. Pandemonium erupted. In all the uproar, an older scientist stood and shouted, “That’s impossible!” but no one really understood what that meant. “Oh, save your archaic language for the emperor; he’s the only one who’d understand you, old man!” shouted a hot, young scientist wearing sunglasses and a lab coat with the sleeves torn off to reveal extraordinarily built arms. I was expecting a stunned hush to come over the crowd, but it seemed everyone had forgotten I was there.

“Hot dog stand out front,” said the Loplolian, finally taking a bite.

The symposium entered a recess when one scientist ran another through with a saber for suggesting the existence of Scondos, which no one actually knew what they were, but we all know how science symposiums can get. I brushed past the paramedics and riot police rushing in, who were muttering “Fucking scientists, every goddamn year.”

The hot dog stand was just outside the main doors. A long line stretched across the terrace, around a gigantic statue depicting a man in a lab coat defiantly chugging something from an Erlenmeyer flask while two other men try to stop him, and out across a nearby road impeding the flow of traffic. Desperately hungry, I thought that I might be able to abuse my position for once in my storied career and cut to the front of the line.

“Hey, hey, hey!” cried the hot dog broker in a thick New York accent, “Who do you think you are!?”

“I sincerely apologize, I’m the Sovereign Emperor of Planet Earth and Her Outlying Colonies, I just…”

The man cut me off, clapping sarcastic over his shoulder, “Oh! The emperor! Look, everybody, it’s the emperor of the friggin’ Earth!” He stopped clapping and shrugged aggressively at me, “What? You think that makes you better than everybody else!?”

“I try to not let it get to my head, I just -“

“Back of the line, bub.”

While I stood in line for two hours and forty-five minutes for my hot dog, I pondered the ephemeral and cyclical nature of things. Tides ebb and flow, mountains form and wind blows them away, laundry is washed, folded, worn, and then washed again.

When I got back to Earth, I made the proper arrangements and booked a stratopod to where I knew in my heart this journey would end. I wore simple robes so that anyone looking would assume I was nothing more than one of the few scattered hermits still living on the Earth’s surface.

“Are you sure this is where you wanna get off?” asked the stratopod operator, her voice ripe with confusion and worry. I looked her up and down; judging by her age there was a distinct chance she had never stepped foot on Terra firma in her life. Smiling, I wished her a nice day and alighted onto the ground below.

The stratopod lifted up and into the sky, zooming off to one of the arcologies in the sky, egg-shaped cities made from glassy, transparent aluminum panels held together by biomechanical vines. If one listened closely, they could hear the whir of the trillions of semi-organic blades of leaves and grasses working together as wings and rotors to keep the grand bastions of humanity afloat among the cumulonimbus clouds, but this sound could easily be mistaken for the wind. These sanctuaries dotted the horizon all across the world and they are where most of humanity had chosen to live. You are probably reading this story in one right now.

A great, grassy plain stretched before me, miles of emerald green grasses swaying in a soft breeze and surrounded by pristine blue mountains. A reclaimer drone whizzed past me at an astonishing velocity, looking for any last bits of rubble or ruin of the various roads, homes, strip malls, libraries, and prisons that used to dot this area; in the blink of an eye it was already almost to the horizon, leaving behind a windswept wake in it’s path and only stopping for a split second to reconstitute an old street sign into its base elements to be reused in the restoration of the environs of old.

After taking in the view, I hoisted The Correct Item onto my back, surprisingly lightweight considering its size and sturdy appearance. While doing so, I accidentally activated a hidden LED panel that showed the current time and temperature.

“My god,” I chuckled to myself, “Even after all these years you continue to surprise me.”

I made off towards the only structure still remaining and operational, to my knowledge, in this sector. It was a squat rectangle of a building with a beige stucco exterior, nestled comfortably in the exact center of this immense field. Large blue letters and the familiar logo acted as a beacon, guiding me towards my final goal.

I stepped into the Goodwill and a glassy-eyed, slack jawed teenager rudely told me that they were closing in fifteen minutes. After a brief back and forth where I argued that just because they were closing soon that didn’t mean they were closed now, the teen acquiesced and accepted my donation. I watched as he placed The Correct Item on the shelf in between a gently used Scondo and a ratking made up of nine shoelaces tied together.

For the first time in a long while, I had nothing to do and nowhere to be. I went outside and sat in the grass, picking a blade and absentmindedly breaking it into halves until I picked a new one, all while staring out at the world I had created. I thought about what that murderer at the pet store said all those years ago.

He was kind of right, I thought, they were all good times.",1,1764838048.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo

1pduq29,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1pduq29/master_small_talk_like_a_pro_without_sounding/,Master SMALL TALK Like a Pro Without Sounding Like a Weird NPC,"Ever been trapped in a convo that feels like it was generated by ChatGPT in 2019? “Nice weather today”… “Crazy traffic, huh?”… yeah, we’ve all been there. The truth is, most of us suck at small talk. And not because we’re awkward or boring. It’s because nobody ever taught us how to do it well. Social media replaced real interactions, and now half of us are way better at texting memes than navigating a 2-minute elevator chat.

But here’s the kicker: small talk isn’t pointless. It’s the gateway drug to real connection, trust, and opportunity. Research from Harvard shows that even short conversations with strangers can boost mood and increase a sense of belonging. Sadly, platforms like TikTok often push “alpha” hacks or “anti-small talk” takes like they’re flexing some superior brain chemistry. Nah. Real experts (psychologists, sociolinguists, even seasoned negotiators) all agree: mastering small talk is a low-key superpower.

So here’s your ultimate guide to becoming a small talk boss, without sounding fake, robotic, or like you’re trying too hard.

---

**Step 1: Reframe the purpose of small talk**

- Don’t treat it like a lame exchange of obvious facts. Small talk is emotional calibration. You're both figuring out: Are you chill? Are you safe? Are we vibing?
- Behavioral psychologist Nick Epley found that we underestimate how much others enjoy talking to us. Most people are more open than we think, they just need a small opening.
- Think of it less as ""what should I say?"" and more like ""what can help us sync?""

**Step 2: Use the “FORD” method (but bend the rules)**

- “FORD”: Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams. These are classic safe topics.
- But here's what makes it work: Don’t just ask generic stuff. Instead of “What do you do?”, say:
  - “What’s your day-to-day like?” or “What part of your job do you actually like?”
  - These open-ended questions avoid sounding formulaic and invite real answers.

**Step 3: Focus on micro-curiosity, not deep connection**

- You don’t need to go full TED Talk. Just aim to be curious for 90 seconds.
- “That’s interesting, what led you to that?” is one of the most versatile follow-ups ever.
- A 2022 study from Psychological Science showed that participants who asked more follow-up questions were rated as more likable, even when the convo was short.

**Step 4: Ditch the script, go observational**

- The best small talk often starts from your shared environment:
  - “Have you had this coffee before? Worth it?”
  - “Is it always this packed here?”
- Harvard Business Review’s Communication Lab suggests focusing on “here-and-now” context boosts relatability and reduces awkward tension.

**Step 5: Memorize a few “soft pivots”**

You talked about work. Now what? Pivoting is the secret.

Ways to gently shift the topic without being weird:

- “That sounds intense. What do you do to unwind?”
- “Totally get that. Ever had a random hobby get you through a week like that?”

These are non-intrusive, smooth, and invite people to open up.

**Step 6: Build a “go-to” mental library**

This sounds dorky but it works. Think of 3 stories, experiences, or random facts you can pull out fast:

- A weird encounter on your commute
- A surprisingly good (or terrible) meal you had
- A question that got you thinking lately

These are your conversation seeds. You don’t force them, but when energy dips, they help reboot the chat.

**Step 7: Practice “looping” for deeper connection**

This is pulled straight from negotiation expert Chris Voss.

- Looping = repeating a word or phrase someone just said with curiosity.
- Example:
  - Them: “I’ve been so swamped with planning this wedding.”
  - You: “Swamped with planning? Sounds like a beast. What’s been the hardest part?”

It’s subtle, but it makes the other person feel heard and keeps the convo flowing.

**Step 8: Know when to exit like a pro**

Not every interaction needs to last forever. Smooth exit strategies:

- “It’s been cool chatting. I’m gonna grab a drink before the line gets wild.”
- “Hey, glad we got to talk. Gonna check in with someone over there.”
- Just signal appreciation, drop a smile, and bounce.

That’s more powerful than letting it awkwardly fizzle out.

Small talk doesn’t need to be torture. When you treat it like a skill, not a personality trait, it becomes way easier to improve. It’s not about being charming or extroverted. It’s about being human, curious, and just a little bit better at turning “how’s your day?” into something that actually matters.",0,1764836550.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,0.5,False

1pduo2s,https://i.redd.it/0d597iscc55g1.png,Redemption of the Cheater's Wife,"Amelia Rivera’s husband, Aiden Cooper, suddenly falls into a coma after six years of marriage. The shocking cure? He must sleep with Ella Campbell 99 times to ""heal"" from the mysterious illness.

Six years ago, Aiden defied his family’s century-old rule to marry Amelia, a pearl diver from a humble background. In a bold act of rebellion, he burned the founder’s portrait, swiftly added her to the family registry, and held their wedding the very next day.

For five years, he cherished her, making her the envy of New York. But in the sixth year, Aiden was struck by a mysterious illness and fell into a coma.

A spiritual healer claimed it's a punishment from the Cooper ancestors, only solvable through a ""Healing Ritual""—where Aiden must sleep with Ella Campbell 99 times.

From then on, Aiden spent every night with Ella, leaving Amelia to suffer in silence, hearing their intimate whispers through the walls.

But Amelia still chose to pray, hoping for Aiden's soon recovery.

Then, after seven days of praying for a talisman, she overhears a conversation that reveals the shocking truth behind Aiden's illness. Betrayed, heartbroken, and furious, she finally sees through the lies.

\*\*\*\*\*

""Aiden, you're brilliant. Faking an illness and making up that Healing Ritual stuff to openly bring your mistress home.""

""Only someone from a humble background like Amelia would believe it. Everyone in New York knows our Aiden fears nothing, not even burning the Founder's Portrait of his family. How could he believe in some healer and a Healing Ritual?""

Amelia’s blood turned cold.

So Aiden wasn't sick at all. It was all a scheme!

The talisman clutched in her hand suddenly felt ridiculous.

Then one of them asked, ""Aiden, you've been with Ella 90 times, right? Nine more, and the Healing Ritual will be over. What are you planning then...""

Aiden lounged on the sofa, two buttons undone, long legs crossed.

He took a sip of wine, lips curling carelessly. ""When it's over, I'll just keep her somewhere outside.""

Amelia stood outside the door, feeling completely chilled to the bone.

But the group only laughed louder. ""That is more than normal for men with status like us. You've been faithful to Amelia for five years. That's enough for her.""

""A woman like Ella, who looks innocent but is wild and unrestrained in bed, is exactly what we men like.""

""So, Aiden, is she much more fun than Amelia?""

As a wine glass slammed heavily on the table, Aiden's drunken eyes suddenly turned sharp.

""No one compares to Amy. I will always love her the most.""

Everyone was stunned.

After a long moment, one finally spoke, asking the question Amelia also wanted to ask. ""Aiden, if you love her, why fake an illness and make her suffer? The family has been giving her hell these past three months. Your mother almost had her punished...""

The air was quiet for a few seconds.

Then, Aiden's low voice came.

""My Cooper family is old money. Anyone who wants to enter my household, even a daughter from a prominent family, must pass a test to prove their loyalty. I made an exception back then and didn't let Amy go through this process, and the family has always held a grudge.

""Now I'm making up for it with this Healing Ritual. She doesn't even make a fuss when I'm with someone else, and she prays devoutly.

""That proves she's obedient and loyal enough, worthy of being a member of the Cooper family.""

He chuckled, his tone dripping with self-satisfied tenderness. ""As for the suffering she's endured, I'll make up for it with a lifetime of devotion.""

Every word stabbed into Amelia’s heart.

She suddenly laughed.

As she laughed, tears streamed down her cheeks.

Everyone in the Cooper family had claimed that Aiden fell ill because he insisted on marrying her.

For these three months, she had endured insults and condemnation on a daily basis.

In the early days of his coma, she’d cried so hard she could barely see out of her right eye, and the grief left her with a heart condition that kept her awake night after night.

While he was in bed with Ella, she prayed in church, shedding tears.

And now, all of it was a lie!

What nonsense about the traditions of an old-money family, what stupid loyalty test...

They were all just excuses!

The truth was simply that he wanted to cheat without facing judgment and guilt.

Tears blurred Amelia's vision. She didn't understand how things had come to this.

Aiden had loved her so genuinely once.

Back then, to pay for her mother's medical treatment, she gave up college and dove for pearls to earn money. That was how she accidentally saved Aiden, who was severely injured and had fallen into the sea.

She brought him home and cared for him for a month. To her surprise, Aiden fell madly in love with her and pursued her passionately.

She didn't believe a wealthy heir could be sincere and rejected him repeatedly, but he refused to give up, relentlessly wearing down her resistance with all his patience and tenderness.

The moment that truly broke her defenses was when Aiden shielded her from sulfuric acid hurled by a rival. His back was left covered with horrifying scars, cold sweat dripping from his chin, yet he still smiled and wiped her tears. ""As long as you're safe.""

At their wedding, he went down on one knee, held her hand, and vowed, ""Amy, I, Aiden Cooper, will love only you in this lifetime. I will never let you suffer the slightest grievance.""

The words still echoed in her ears, which now had become a bitter mockery.

Amelia's tears had run dry, but the laughter in the living room continued.

Suddenly, someone sighed. ""Aiden, Amelia has been your wife for five years. She has some cunning. Aren't you afraid she might... leave you if she finds out about Ella?""

Aiden was silent for a moment, his Adam's apple bobbing. ""Then we make sure she never finds out. Keep your mouths shut.""

The whole group immediately fell silent, but then one of them cautiously asked, ""What if she does find out... and wants a divorce?""

Aiden smirked. ""She loves me too much to leave.

""Besides, who in all of New York would dare process a divorce for her without my consent?

""Even if she did run away,"" his expression turned sharp, ""I could find her and bring her back! Her name is in the family registry. For life and death, she belongs to me. She can only stay by my side.""

Amelia's breath caught. Her nails dug deeply into her arms.

Aiden, you're wrong!

How dare you think I would still love you after you've played me for a fool? How dare you think I can't leave you?

Amelia wiped her tears and, without hesitation, threw the talisman into the trash.

Then, expressionless, she left and did two things.

First, she went to her mother and told her about Aiden's affair.

After hearing that, her mother was deeply saddened. ""I never should have agreed to you marrying into that wealthy family. Back then, he knelt before me for ten days and nights, caught in the rain until he developed pneumonia and still refused to go to the hospital unless I gave my blessing. I thought he was a good man... Oh, Amelia, I support you. Let's leave together.""

Second, she went with her mother to legally change their names.

Since Aiden said her name was in the family registry and she could never leave the Cooper family in life or death, she would ensure ""Amelia Rivera"" no longer existed in this world.

The legal process would take half a month. Amelia told her mother to wait patiently. She had to return to the Cooper mansion to stay by Aiden Cooper's side and not let him detect anything unusual.

Otherwise, with his power, neither of them would be able to escape.

Amelia returned to the mansion.

And the moment she stepped through the door, she saw something that struck her like lightning.

Aiden was on the couch with Ella, and Ella was wearing...

Her wedding dress!

Chapter 2

The keys slipped from Amelia's hand, clattering to the floor.

Aiden frowned and turned. Seeing it was Amelia, his movements froze abruptly.

He quickly zipped his pants. When he looked up again, all traces of panic were gone, replaced by the composure unique to a man of his stature.

""Amy... you're home?"" He asked with a smile.

Amelia dug her nails deeply into her arm, the pain sharp.

After a long time, she heard her own voice, faint and airy.

""Am I not allowed to come home now?""

Aiden chuckled lightly. ""That's not what I meant. You said you wanted to get me a protective talisman, right? I thought it would take longer.""

As he spoke, he reached out to ruffle her hair, but she dodged his hand.

His smile stiffened. ""Are you angry? Just because I let Ella wear one of your dresses?""

""One of my dresses..."" Amelia's voice trembled as she looked at Aiden in disbelief.

That was her most treasured wedding dress. She had sewn every pearl on it by hand. The first time she wore it, Aiden's eyes were full of awe. ""Amelia, you're so beautiful. This dress is meant only for you. You have to wear it for me every year.""

But now, he had let another woman wear it... and do that in it!

Amelia stared into his eyes, searching for a trace of guilt, but found only glaring nonchalance.

Her heart felt as if it were being squeezed tight. The pain made her almost fall on her feet.

Was Aiden so certain... that she was desperately in love with him and that she would endure anything he did?

Aiden stepped forward, grasping her trembling hand, his tone softening. ""Alright, don't be angry. I'll transfer 10 million to you. Buy whatever you want.""

A flash of jealousy crossed Ella's eyes. She suddenly knelt before Amelia, tears appearing on demand. ""Mrs. Cooper, I'm sorry... It's all my fault, I liked this dress so much, and Mr. Cooper just let me try it on...""

Her words, though apologetic, sounded more like showing off. She was basically saying that Aiden doted a lot on her.

Ella shot a triumphant glance at Amelia and then cried even harder. ""Mrs. Cooper, please don't be angry. I'll take it off and return it to you right now...""

Amelia's gaze swept over the stain on the dress. ""It's already dirty,"" She said flatly. ""I don't want it anymore. You keep it.""

Aiden frowned deeply, his voice stern. ""Amy, stop this nonsense. How can you just give away your wedding dress?""

Amelia's lips twitched. She was about to speak.

Just then, Aiden's phone rang.

He glanced at the caller ID and then looked at Ella.

Ella immediately forced an understanding smile. ""Mr. Cooper, don't mind me. Please take the call.""

Aiden shook his head, his voice gentle. ""You always get a headache hearing me talk business. I'll take it outside. Don't kneel anymore. Get up now.""

With that, he walked out.

Amelia stood rooted to the spot, her heart feeling as if a blunt knife had been thrust through it.

He never used to discuss business outside because of commercial confidentiality. But now, for Ella, he could change even that habit.

Only Amelia and Ella remained in the living room.

Ella patted her dress and stood up. The vulnerability on her face suddenly vanished, instantly replaced by blatant provocation.

""You still don't know, do you?"" She sneered, leaning closer. ""Aiden's mysterious illness was fake. It was just an excuse to use the Healing Ritual to bring me in legitimately.

""We've been together for over a year and tried every position possible. Just because I mentioned I'd never tried it at home, he immediately 'fell ill'...

""Amelia, now I have got both his body and his heart. What do you have left besides the title?""

Amelia glanced at her indifferently. ""You can have the title, too.""

Ella was taken aback and then turned furious. ""I don't need you to give it to me! He was always mine! Your position will be mine sooner or later!""

Seeing Amelia remain unmoved, she paled with rage.

Just then, the sound of Aiden's approaching footsteps came from outside.

A vicious glint flashed in Ella's eyes. She suddenly grabbed the scalding teapot from the coffee table and, without hesitation, smashed it against herself!

""Ah!""

A piercing scream echoed. Ella staggered and fell, the fair skin on her chest now red and blistered.

She struggled onto her knees, crawling to Amelia's feet, sobbing and trembling. ""Mrs. Cooper, I am so sorry. I shouldn't have worn your dress. Please, let me go...""

When Aiden rushed in, this was the scene that met him.

His face darkened instantly. He narrowed his eyes at Amelia. ""I already offered you compensation, and you still dare to hurt her? Apologize to her!""

""I won't apologize for something I never did,"" Amelia said calmly.

""Still denying it?"" Danger flickered in Aiden's eyes. ""Fine. I'll make you admit it.""

Amelia was dragged away by bodyguards to the sauna room.

As the glass door locked shut, the heat felt like countless tiny needles pricking her skin.

The needle on the temperature gauge kept climbing.

50°C...

60°C...

70°C...

Amelia's face was flushed crimson, suffocating in the steam.

Aiden stood outside, toying with his wedding ring, his voice low. ""Still not admitting it?""

Amelia threw herself against the door, pounding on it desperately. Her palms sizzled against the hot glass, leaving bloody handprints that evaporated almost instantly.

""It really wasn't me, Aiden! Why don't you check the surveillance?"" She pleaded, struggling in panic.

""That won't be necessary. Ella wouldn't lie to me. You, on the other hand, are becoming less and less obedient."" Aiden didn't look up. He asked again, ""Do you admit your mistake?""

Amelia trembled uncontrollably. Aiden did adore his mistress a lot.

Her heart was torn apart in the intense heat. She truly couldn't hold on any longer!

""I admit it...""

Her throat was cracked. She forced out the words hoarsely, lying to him for the first time. ""I was wrong.""

A satisfied smile touched Aiden's lips. He raised his hand slightly, signaling the bodyguards to stop.

Amelia was let out. She was drenched in sweat, her body temperature frighteningly high.

Aiden looked at her disheveled state and touched her cracked lips soothingly. ""See, if you'd admitted it earlier, you wouldn't have had to suffer.

""You don't need to apologize to Ella this time, but..."" He added as his eyes darkened, ""Don't let it happen again.""

Darkness swam before her eyes. Amelia's legs gave way, and she collapsed. The burns on her skin stung while the pain in her heart was even worse.

Tears fell uncontrollably.

She had a congenital heart condition. Surviving this long was already a struggle.

Before, Aiden had been so protective of her, forbidding the servants from making any noise in case they startled her.

He had held her and said, ""You are my life. I can't let you come to any harm.""

But now, he had locked her in a sauna room that could have killed her at any moment.

So, vows were only true the moment they were spoken.

Chapter 3

Leaning against the wall, Amelia stumbled upstairs.

The moment she entered the room, she pulled out everything connected to Aiden.

The photos and love letters she once treasured, the postcards bought during their travels together...

She picked up an old sketchbook and suddenly froze.

Aiden had drawn it himself, having a record of every step of their love story.

The first page was the scene of their first meeting by the sea, where she saved Aiden, drenched in blood. He was captivated at first glance.

The tenth page was about the first time he took her to the Cooper family home. His mother told her to crawl into the house. She turned and left. Aiden chased after her, apologizing repeatedly. ""Amy, I failed to protect you/ I let you be wronged. I promise it will never happen again.""

That time, he sent his mother away for six months.

The twentieth page was about the time when he announced before the entire family his intention to marry her. His grandfather took him to the family chapel, warning him that defying the family creed would incur the ancestors' punishment.

Amelia would never forget that day. Aiden sneered, threw a ceremonial portrait into the fire, and said in front of everyone, ""I am the head now. I set the rules. What do the ancestors matter?""

But now...

He was using that ""ancestral punishment"" as an excuse to bring his mistress home.

Amelia clenched the sketchbook tightly, suddenly remembering the warning from Aiden's grandfather before the wedding.

""My grandson only likes obedient dogs. If you want to stay by his side, you must be content being a good, obedient dog!""

Back then, she didn't believe it, thinking it was just his grandfather trying to scare her and break them up.

Now she understood. Aiden was the one in power. He only liked absolute obedience. He only adored puppets, forever dependent on him.

And she, Amelia, would never be anyone's accessory!

Without further hesitation, she threw everything into the fireplace.

Just as she turned, she collided with Aiden's intense gaze.

He stared at the flickering flames, his voice unreadable.

""What are you burning?""

Amelia lowered her eyes, her voice faint. ""Just some things I don't need anymore.""

Aiden nodded casually, took out the first aid kit, and began tending to her wounds. ""See? Even after punishing you, I, your husband, still care for you the most. I'm here to dress your wounds.""

His hands were warm and dry, his touch gentle, yet every inch of skin he touched felt piercingly cold.

""Amy, it's your mother's birthday in three days. I plan to throw a grand celebration and invite all of New York's elite.""

Amelia said flatly, ""No need. My mother doesn't like those kinds of occasions.""

""I insist."" Aiden gently ruffled her hair, his tone irresistible. ""Be good. I must let everyone see how much I dote on you.""

Amelia lowered her eyes, feeling neither touched nor exhausted.

Three days later...

The banquet was held at the largest hotel under the Cooper Group. Almost all of New York's upper crust attended.

""Mr. Cooper is so devoted to his wife! He's spending billions on his mother-in-law's birthday!""

""Mr. Cooper is truly the perfect husband. Mrs. Cooper is so lucky!""

""...""

Everyone was discussing how doting Aiden was.

But in a corner, Catherine Rivera, Amelia's mother, looking at the burns on her daughter's hands, had red-rimmed eyes. ""My little girl, you've been wronged. Just hold on for half a month more, and I'll take you away.""

Amelia's nose stung, and she desperately wanted to cry. But afraid Aiden would notice something off, she tilted her head back, forcing the tears to stay in.

Aiden took a phone call and walked over to them.

""Amy, Ella says she also wants to come wish your mom a happy birthday...""

""I don't want to see her,"" Amelia said coldly.

Aiden frowned. ""Don't be difficult. She's already on her way. Don't make things hard for her later.""

With that, he turned and left, his gaze fixed on the entrance, not sparing Amelia another glance.

Amelia stood there stunned, her heart aching.

Unable to watch any longer, Catherine led her to the terrace.

The night wind was bitingly cold.

Catherine put a coat over her shoulders. ""Amy, look, the moonlight is beautiful tonight. Tomorrow will probably be a sunny day.""

Amelia whispered, ""Let's hope so...""

Before she finished speaking, hurried footsteps approached.

Aiden, his face stern, grabbed her wrist, his grip so tight that it nearly crushed the bone. ""Ella is missing. Did you kidnap her? Tell me! Where is she?""

Amelia's face paled with pain, but she still straightened her spine and met his gaze. ""It wasn't me.""

Aiden stared at her for a few seconds and then gave a cold laugh. ""Fine. Won't admit it? I'll make you talk!""

The ruthlessness flashing in his eyes sent a chill through Amelia's entire body.

Then, he barked an order. ""Guards! Take Catherine away!""

Bodyguards immediately stepped forward, forcibly dragging Catherine out.

""Aiden, let my mother go! Where are you taking her?"" Amelia fought like a madwoman to stop them, but the bodyguard would not let her go.

No matter how she struggled, cried, or screamed, Aiden didn't loosen his grip.

In the banquet hall...

Amelia was forced to her knees on the cold marble floor.

Aiden leaned back on the leather sofa, legs crossed. He took a slow drag of his cigarette. Through the haze of smoke, his icy voice came.

""Where is Ella?""

Amelia shook her head numbly.

She'd lost count of how many times Aiden had asked her. But she didn't do it. She truly didn't know.

Aiden stood up, stubbed out his cigarette, and forced Amelia's chin up. ""You are far too disobedient.""

He crooked a finger. A bodyguard leaned in and handed him a phone. He played a video.

In the video, Catherine was tied to a chair, a timed bomb strapped to her chest, the countdown numbers ticking down relentlessly.

Chapter 4

Aiden's tone was coaxing, but his gaze was sharp as ice. ""Amy, I'm only giving you 50 minutes.""

Amelia's face instantly turned deathly pale.

She trembled as she asked, ""If we can't find Ella, will you really kill my mother?""

He leaned closer, his dark pupils reflecting her trembling body. ""Try me.""

Amelia shuddered, the tears she'd held back for so long finally spilling over.

""Aiden, that's my mother! My most important person! You can't do this to her!""

He let out a light laugh, but his eyes remained terrifyingly cold. ""But Ella is also my most important person now.""

""Most important?"" Amelia looked at him in disbelief. ""More important than me and my mother?""

Aiden's expression didn't change. ""Ella gave me her virginity. A young girl like her offered herself in the Healing Ritual to save me. She's my savior. As for you, you will always be the one I love most. How many times have I told you? I'll send her away after the Healing Ritual ends. Couldn't you just wait? Did you have to move against her?""

Amelia stared at Aiden, feeling only a chill piercing her heart.

He loved her most?

Did he love her so much that he would fake an illness to deceive her for his mistress? He was even now trying to kill her mother!

Amelia had no patience left to play along. She was just about to expose his lies.

Suddenly, a bodyguard rushed in, shouting urgently, ""Mr. Cooper, we've found Ms. Campbell!""

Aiden grabbed his blazer and strode out.

""What about my mother?"" Amelia threw herself forward, clutching desperately at his legs. ""Let her go, now!""

Aiden glanced back, his look cold. ""The abandoned warehouse in the east end. Go find her yourself.""

Amelia rushed out the door like a madwoman, speeding all the way over.

When she found Catherine, she saw the bomb on her chest was still counting down!

Aiden hadn't even had it disarmed!

The ticking of the countdown echoed like a death knell. Only one minute left!

Amelia tore the tape from her mother's mouth, her hands shaking as she tried to undo the ropes, but they wouldn't come loose.

""Amy, leave me! Get out of here now!"" Catherine shook her head frantically.

Tears streamed down Amelia's face. ""Mom, I won't leave you...""

Suddenly, Catherine shoved her away with all her might, kicking her feet against the floor, throwing herself and the chair backwards—

Amelia screamed, her heart shattering. ""Mom!""

The explosion roared, the blast wave hurling her backwards.

Amelia hit the ground hard, her vision filling with nothing but a bloody red.

In the hospital...

Catherine's injuries were severe. Though she survived, she might never wake up.

Amelia knelt by the hospital bed, tears flowing uncontrollably. ""Mom, I'm so sorry. It's my fault you're involved in this...""

She apologized over and over, but Catherine gave no response.

Amelia's heart ached as if being torn apart.

Just hours ago, her mother was smiling, holding her hand, comforting her softly.

But now, she could only lie here, unmoving.

All of this, caused by the very man who claimed to love her!

Amelia cried until her voice was hoarse, finally collapsing into unconsciousness.

When she opened her eyes again...

Amelia found her hand being held. Aiden was by the bedside, his voice unusually soft.

""I'm sorry, Amy. It was all a misunderstanding. Ella's phone just died. That's why we couldn't reach her.

""I acted impulsively.""

Amelia coldly withdrew her hand, her heart filled with bitter irony and coldness.

This was his 'love' for her?

Just because Ella didn't answer her phone, he kidnapped her mother without even investigating!

""Amy, please don't be angry. It's just that you've targeted her before, so I suspected you..."" Aiden's eyes were red, his voice low and raspy. ""Hit me! Yell at me and do anything you want...""

Thud!

The hospital room door suddenly swung open. Ella rushed in, her eyes swollen. ""Mrs. Cooper, it's all my fault. Please don't blame Mr. Cooper...""

She bowed over and over again, crying pitifully. ""If only I had charged my phone in time... Mr. Cooper wouldn't have been so worried about me that he... and your mother wouldn't be... like this now...""

Amelia's nails dug sharply into her palms. Ella was clearly here to provoke her!

She was about to throw her out when she saw Aiden bend down to help Ella up, his tone gentle. ""It's not your fault. Don't cry. It's not good for your health.""

Watching this scene, Amelia felt both hurt and bitter.

How ironic! Her mother almost died and was now lying critically injured in a coma, yet her husband was worried about another woman 'crying'.

""Get out!"" Amelia's voice was hoarse. ""Both of you, get out!""

Aiden was taken aback. ""Amy...""

""Get out!""

She grabbed the vase from the bedside table and smashed it violently onto the floor.

Aiden stood up. ""Amy, calm down first. I'll make it up to you in a few days.""

With that, he escorted Ella out.

The moment the door closed, Amelia could no longer restrain herself and broke down into sobs.

She didn't want any compensation...

She wanted nothing, only for her mother to open her eyes and look at her one more time.

Chapter 5

Over the next few days, Aiden tried every way to please Amelia.

The latest jewelry, limited-edition bags, air-freighted fresh flowers... But Amelia didn't even glance at them.

Her attitude finally changed when Aiden brought in the eminent medical authority, Dr. Peter Hernandez.

""Mrs. Cooper, the bomb only caused external injuries. Your mother's coma is because her head hit a stone. She just needs cranial surgery and could wake up within a week. However, this surgery is extremely risky. I'm the only one in the world who can perform it.""

Amelia was thrilled, thanking him repeatedly.

Peter waved a hand. ""I stopped operating long ago. If Mr. Cooper hadn't conceded 50% of the profits and stood in the rain outside my house all night, I would never have made an exception.""

Amelia looked at Aiden, her expression complex.

After a long moment, she said softly, ""Thank you, Mr. Cooper.""

Aiden was taken aback, a flash of hurt in his eyes. ""Amy, stop this... Don't treat me like this, please.""

Amelia turned her head away, avoiding his gaze.

Before, when he made her angry, he would also lower his stance like this to coax her, and Amelia would always soften and forgive him.

But this time was different.

He had nearly killed her mother. She couldn't forgive him.

During the surgery, Aiden stayed by Amelia's side all the time.

He sat with her on the hallway bench, handed her water and food, occasionally squeezing her hand and comforting her softly, ""Don't be afraid. Catherine will be fine.""

Amelia suddenly remembered the year they first married, when her mother had surgery, he had also accompanied her with the same tenderness and patience.

Looking at Aiden's softened profile, she felt a momentary daze, as if everything had returned to the past.

Yet the scent of Ella's perfume clinging to him sobered Amelia up.

Catherine's surgery was successful.

The next day, Amelia went to buy some daily necessities.

But she was stopped in the parking lot.

It was Ella.

She smiled dazzlingly. ""Do you really think Aiden cares about you or your mother? Let me tell you the truth. The day your mother fell into a coma, he was in high spirits. We did it three times, and we played until dawn.""

Amelia's heart sank again. ""What do you want?""

""I want you to step aside.""

""Soon,"" Amelia said calmly, looking at her. ""I will step aside completely.""
