1hbzuf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hbzuf6/i_feel_like_im_drowning_in_my_relationship_how_do/,I feel like I'm drowning in my relationship. How do I fix this?,"Hey reddit, I wasn't really sure where to post for advice. 

Let me start off by saying I love my partner. For a long time I thought they were my person, and I do still generally think that. And a bit of backstory, I suppose.

Me (F22) and my partner (NB-23) have been together over 2 years. They moved in with me, and I've been the breadwinner since then (my partner has lots of health and mental issues they're working out). I don't mind being the breadwinner at all, I honestly enjoy it. Finances are not contributing to my stress and feelings of resentment in my relationship, at least not to me.


In the time we have lived together, I've done the majority of the housework as well. We have rescue pets that take up a decent bit of our time. A lot of my issues stem from my recent job change, as I'm now WFH. 

My partner never really enjoyed cooking. When I worked outside of the house, they would generally clean and do the dishes- very normal things, I cleaned up our room and spare room on the weekends. I also cook basically all of our meals, except the one offs that they want to try a recipe or anything. I'm the one going to the grocery every week, getting their odds and ends and running their errands (and mine, obviously). I never saw an issue with it, I'd have to go to the grocery anyways and run errands even if we weren't together. 

They have severe agoraphobia, and really struggle going outside in big groups of people. We're slowly working on it and building confidence. 

My issue now is that I'm WFH, and the chores my partner did do.. have all fallen onto me. At first I didn't care, it doesn't take long. But it's been slowly getting to me, the lack of.. effort, I guess? 

There have been 4 or 5 times in our relationship I've sat them down and told them I was struggling. Ive said, verbatim, on 3 of those times that I felt like I was drowning. I've dropped a lot of my hobbies, I just can't seem to enjoy them when I know there's other shit I should be doing. Things will change a little bit, but it never lasts more than a week. It's not them going out of their way and doing chores, it's then just anytime I mention I'm going to do something, they get up and do it. Which is nice, don't get me wrong.. but I'm not a manager. Things don't get done if I don't say. Our pets medication? It'll be forgotten if I don't do it. Their coffee? They'll just be irritable and not drink it that day if I don't make it. Taking the trash out to the street, absolutely not. Remembering appointments, on me once again. Making the meal plan, doing the shopping, cooking, and cleaning? All on me.

I do all of the cleaning for our pets, and I do most of the laundry, though they do fold it with me which is nice. I'm just tired. I wake up worried it got too cold at night because, even though my partner stays up all night most of the time, they don't check the pets or to make sure it's a good temp for them (we don't usually have on the central heat all the time, I use space heaters mostly because it's more cost effective.)

I should mention that my partner has been on and off  depressed (I think they've been in a slump most of our relationship). They definitely have some executive dysfunction, and I understand that makes it even harder to do things. Her parents are both diagnosed and I'm sure she is on the spectrum as well, and I don't know or have the tools to help them, and I feel terrible.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help, I've taken over every responsibility I can think of, and therapy is ungodly expensive. I don't want to 'just break up', not just because I'm the breadwinner but because I love them, they're my person, I want this to work. I just don't know how. 

How do I help? How do I communicate this in a productive way?


TL;DR: I started a WFH job and now all of the household and financial responsibilities fall onto me. How do I change this and make my partner see that I am struggling and unhappy?",1,1733940607.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Over the last year or so I've really started to hone in my technique and also get a better understanding of how I should tweak my setup. If I had to start from scratch, I would've probably done things a bit differently (prioritized spending differently for sure, but some of this was gifted, and some things were kept with convenience in mind because while my wife enjoys a great cup of coffee, she prefers the process be more simple). All-in-all, I'm happy with how things evolved and love my setup.

What are some things that I can do to go from here? My most recent upgrade was the Fellow scale (I love the built-in timer and brew assist mode!). A grinder upgrade will eventually be on the list (I've used my Timemore Chestnut c2 almost exclusively for pourovers lately, but the Encore is nice for a larger brew in the Chemex), but I'm wondering what I can do that won't have a significant cost (for context, I'm mainly referring to equipment.

Obviously, it’s up to the company renting the unit if they would like to only use it for staff and or customers/clients as well which would affect overall consumption/ price point.

Included in the monthly cost would be weekly/bi-weekly restock let’s say on Monday mornings with a new pods, sugar, cream, stir sticks, cups, lids .. etc. I understand not everyone is a coffee drinker so there would be a few teas available as well and non-caffeinated options for both. Also, within the rental cost it will include servicing on a certain schedule to ensure it runs efficiently and we would cover the cost of basic repairs that are expected to occur with a machine of this sort. 

Would it be beneficial to provide a tiered subscription system saying you receive x amount of this product within a monthly time period and for a more inclusive package it costs more ? 
I have yet to receive a quote for the machines I am looking to use and the approximate cost of additional goods required to make an accurate estimate on monthly costs. So I have yet to set a price range for these ideas yet. Is there a recommendation for profit margins to stick to for this kind of business model as a recurring payment schedule.

Also, as an outsider looking in would this interest anyone, and what price point would you be willing to spend on this.

I'm looking for someone to play coop games with (we were here, it takes two, ...) or any other kind of multiplayer games. I find that it's a great way to break the ice and get to know each other slowly while playing together. For now I'm mostly looking for friendship but I'm not opposed for it to develop into something more if the feelings are there (and if we're able to work together in a coop game, there's a good chance we might make a relationship work, no ?). It would be best if you live in Europe to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country sometimes next year so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also coop games and multiplayer ones (what a surprise, right ?). I like reading and tabletop RPG.

I'm practicing martial arts, a bit of bouldering and running with my colleagues (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to motivate myself to continue).

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like from time to time to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

""Sereptis and Astrua had received a threatening message with each other's name, said threats had a location to fight each other, both went to the location and fought for a while, but then they realized that neither sent a message to the other, they realized that it was just a very clever troll and that he wanted to end their relationship, in the end they both decided to go have a coffee or tea to apologize for the fight and for the insults they made between them.

1hbze3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hbze3k/my_superautomatic_cost_analysis/,My Super-automatic Cost Analysis,"I initially considered posting this under a recent [QUALITY POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hbtib1/this_is_why_you_buy_quality_74k_preps_later/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) but I worried that my information might get lost or derail the original post, which I found very engaging.

When I purchased my Jura Giga 10, I aimed to find the best machine for my home that could handle my daily drinks—Americano and espresso—while also accommodating milk drinks for my lady friend when she stays over, and allowing me to experiment with cold drinks. I also wanted a machine with dual bins.

Was the upfront cost high? Yes, around $6,000. However, I believe I invested in a machine that will last me at least 10 years. Are there guarantees? No, just as there are no guarantees that I won't crash into a tree and die while skiing. Yet, there is enough evidence for me to feel confident that these machines can handle anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 brewing cycles. I recently met a woman who has had her Jura running strong at 14,500 brew cycles, with only one service done.

After reading the aforementioned post, I decided to crunch some numbers for fun. Based on my machine's expected lifespan of 10 years, initial cost, $1,000 for maintenance, and an average of 1,040 cups per year, here’s the breakdown of my cost per cup:

* Machine only: $0.67
* Machine + middle-of-the-road Costco beans: $0.79
* Machine + Lavazza beans: $0.89
* Machine + online roaster: $1.07
* Machine + local roaster: $1.13

Considering the quality of coffee it produces and the variety of drinks I can make, convenience, I feel good about averaging $1 per drink, factoring in the total cost of the machine!

As I write this, I’m sitting in my favorite coffee house paying $6 (including tip) for my Americano, which adds an interesting perspective on the total cost doesn't it.

I hope others find this information and breakdown interesting.

For example if the rubric asks why are coffee machines important for team morale the first sentence of my paper will be something like coffee machines are important for morale because....

I'll explain.  I spilled coffee yesterday on the floor \*near\* my thinkpad P52's power brick, and I'm pretty sure nothing got on it, didn't see any moisture on it, reseated all the connections, etc.  Suddenly my computer is running extremely slow, like even buffering mouse inputs, which is something I've only seen when one of my computers thinks it's on battery power.  According to windows, the computer is charging, but I did see the battery percentage drop 1 percent over the course of the entire day, which would lead me to think either the adapter (which may have moisture damage now from that spill), or the battery is going bad. I went into the bios and set the 'on battery' power mode from 'power saving' to 'max performance' but it hasn't helped.  Anyone know of any way to just tell the computer to use full power even if it thinks there's a power issue?

Upon arrival the bus operator pointed us to a person who wasn’t in uniform, who told us we had 2 options since our flight is in 8 hours; to use the lounge for a really high price (via their weird counter, not at the lounge directly) or to follow them on a local tour for a price. 

We tried to leave and mentioned that we wish to get a coffee from a nearby coffee place but he aggressively told us that the lounge has coffee or we could also get coffee first while he “guarded” our luggage. We immediately felt something is strange and insisted to leave on our own. We went to a nearby food court instead. 

After googling, we only noticed a few Trip Advisor comments about this, stating overcharging of lounge prices and additional costs. Is this a common scam? Has anyone experienced this too?",1,1733938996.0,maldives,0,1.0,False

I have ZERO spontaneous pain and it doesn't keep me up at night. I am able to eat and drink normally. There is no abcess, pain, inflammation or anything other than a tint of gray to my tooth. 

I don't have insurance so this is all coming out of pocket.  My concern is how quick my dentist did the x-ray, saw nothing but just said I needed a root canal or I could get veneers. I called today with more questions and now my dentist wants me to see an endodontist.

I want a definitive answer on if I need a root canal, do I wait a few weeks to see if it's reversible pulpitis, bruised tooth and/or maybe heals?

BACKSTORY- I have been wearing invisalign and having regular check ups with my orthodontist for the past 2 years. I have had TREMENDOUS success with these and I was on my last week of ""active"" trays when I put in the new trays for the week and felt a sharp stinging pain. I just blamed it on the movements being made as my ortho said we were working on correcting some of my overbite these next few weeks. Well, I took the trays out and planned to call my ortho to let her know they were not fitting correctly. I could feel the notches in the trays not tracking and a very large gap between my trays and teeth on the inner portion of my top front incisors. It was Thanksgiving and they were closed so I waited until Monday to reach out, the whole weekend my front incisors on the right side were sore. I unfortunately got busy and was unable to be seen before I flew out of the country and since the pain was just a little soreness, I neglected to go back to ortho. I did however go back to wearing the old trays that fit just before I swapped the night before Thanksgiving. I wake up Friday morning to notice my tooth has some gray tint to the root. No pain, no abscess or throbbing. I come back Monday (it's now been 10 days since the incident) and I get an X-ray at my dentist and they can't see anything BUT based on the gray tooth they say I need a root canal. 

  
I have trust issues and would just like to hear from anyone else or any professional advice... Do I wait this out or just go get the root canal and internal bleaching? ",1,1733938718.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

What is the science behind it? In layman's terms anyway.","# Disclaimer: I know neither are that good for you, I am just curious about the answer to this.



I drink an energy drink a day regardless of the time of year, but in the winter, as a seasonal depression coping mechanism, I can drink more caffeine either from energy drinks, or from coffee. I usually always drink sugar free energy drinks vs the ones with sugar, and like so many people with adhd, I lean more towards monster energy drinks. (I think the taurine and b12 in monsters helps manage my adhd better than coffee does, which has neither of those things).



But what exactly is it about energy drinks that causes issues that coffee doesn't appear to cause, because I wont deny the fact that there genuinely, from word of mouth anyway, there are way more cases of people ending up in the hospital from energy drink use than those who drink coffee. None of the people who tell me about how so and so ended up in the hospital from energy drinks ever mentions coffee as being even just part of the issue.

I’ve been on my Tirz journey since April of 2023. I had a really slow start and actually a pretty slow journey but every single pound adds up! My starting weight was 221 and I’m currently at 137. I’m 5’6” for reference and a 49 year old female. I’m feeling and looking so much better! First off I wanted to share with you some things that have worked for me along the way. First- if you don’t fix your sleep- you will still have a hard time loosing even with GLPs. Once I fixed my sleep I started losing the weight and felt so much better both mentally and physically. Secondly- only weigh yourself if you feel mentally ready and you feel “cleaned out” (if you catch my drift). I used the Happy Scale app to track my weight. There were many mornings that I weighed more than the time I weighed before and I never ever put the higher weight in the app. Just wait to report the next time when you weigh less. I know if I weigh in at 2 pounds over the last time that I didn’t eat an extra 7,000 calories, so I don’t report that. Third- don’t be afraid to increase your dose when you are at a stall. I was at a stall for months in the beginning because I was too cheap to increase my dose. Time wasted. Eventually I added in Sema and broke another stall. I landed at 10mg Tirz with 0.50 mg Sema taken together every 5-7 days. That worked for me but we are all different. Some people can microdose and that works for them! 

Now, I have a question for everybody- how do you determine your goal weight? I thought mine would be 138 but now I’m at 137 but when I weigh myself with clothes on after my coffee I’m at like 140 and I’d like to weigh in at a doctors appointment at 137 so I’m thinking that my goal might be like 134. I also know that sounds silly…. So, does anyone have any methods for determining their goal weight? Also, when I was on my journey I would be so annoyed when people talked about their last couple of pounds because I was still in the thick of it and I thought it was so silly and I just want to tell those of you who are still in the middle or beginning of your journey- it is silly and not important. Keep going. Every time the scale moves even 0.2 pounds- it adds up. You will eventually get there! Slow and steady. This isn’t a race. I look at this as a lifetime. GLPs have changed my life and I imagine I will be on them for the rest of my life and I love that for me. It might look a little different- maybe injecting every 10 days or at a lower dose, who knows but what I do know is that the all consuming food noise is no longer welcome….",3,1733938094.0,Tirzeglutide,2,1.0,False

At the point i began to place a personal mark om the bottle to address the issue, but always noticed between friday to monday a significant amount had been used up.

I purchased a locked bottle cap which prevented others using my bottle.

2 months down the line, someone has thrown my new bottle of milk away.. i feel it's personal but i cant address the issue due to the firm having 3 split shifts and many workers.

How do resolve my issue seen as i cant fix it at a larger scale, and its not in anyones best interest. I am a regular coffee and tea drinker?

I feel like since i locked up my belongings it has affected quite a few 'colleagues'",1,1733937676.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False
1hbyn4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiasocial/comments/1hbyn4u/met_someone_on_a_night_train/,Met someone on a night train,"I was walking down the platform, dragging my suitcase and juggling a coffee I’d just picked up from a little stall. My coach was way down, so I kept moving, sipping my coffee and half-watching the crowd.

Then I saw it—a free spot on a bench. Sitting there was this guy with glasses and a black cap, talking on the phone. I hesitated for a second, wondering if I should ask him to move over, but before I could, he shifted and made space for me. Just like that.

I sat down, and that’s when it hit me—he smelled familiar. It didn’t take long to figure out why. We were wearing the same perfume. I couldn’t help but smile to myself. What were the odds?

I listened to his voice as he talked on the phone, and honestly, I loved it. There was something calming about it—low and steady, like it was meant to cut through the chaos of the station. The train was late, and I was already getting restless, but listening to him somehow made waiting easier.

When he hung up, I asked, “Do you know if the train’s delayed?”

He turned to me, smiled (and wow, that smile), and said, “Should be here in 10 minutes.” Then he paused, like he was deciding something, and asked, “Where are you from?”

That’s how it started. We started talking and, to my surprise, found out we worked at the same company. What?! I told him I was trying to transfer to our office in this city and had just spent two exhausting weeks house-hunting. He laughed and shared his own story of how tough it was to find a place when he first moved here. There was something so easy about talking to him, like we’d known each other forever.

When the train finally pulled in, he asked for my seat number before we got on. At first, I didn’t think much of it. I settled into my seat, thinking that was the end of it. But an hour into the journey, he showed up. “The couple next to me wanted the lights off,” he said, a little sheepishly. “Mind if I sit here?”

Of course, I didn’t mind.

We ended up sitting across from each other for hours. I was watching a series on Netflix; he was reading The God Delusion. Every so often, our eyes would meet—just these small, fleeting moments where the world outside the window seemed to blur, and it was just us.

It was a night ride, so the lights from outside would flash through the windows, hitting his face in this way that made everything feel kind of cinematic. We talked in between, about work, our families, and even our hometowns. Turns out his is just an hour from mine.

And his voice. I don’t know how to explain it, but it made me feel calm, like everything was okay just because he was there. That familiar perfume didn’t help either—it felt like this invisible link between us, something we’d unknowingly shared before we even met.

I don’t know why, but that train ride felt like it existed in its own bubble, like time paused just for us. I almost didn’t want it to end.

I was back home, replaying that night in my head—the smell of his perfume, the way he’d glance at me, the sound of his voice. I didn’t even know if it was just a random encounter or something more. But I kind of hoped it wasn’t the last time I saw him.",3,1733937632.0,indiasocial,3,0.8,False

What do you do after making a milk based drink, other than cleaning up the wand.

Im asking this because the owner told me to definetly let the steam out so that the machine can cool down. I'm not sure about this though. I can't find anything about this information on the internet. 

So basically he would let steam out through the boiler (it takes approximately 15 seconds) after that, the machine cools down to espresso temperature. However do I really need to do this? Even if I' m done and want to turn the machine off? 
He meant, if I don't do this, then the steam will get condensed in the boiler and that might be a problem in the long term. I can't find anything about this on the internet though, so I'm asking here if it's true. 

Also he told me that I can do this through the steam wand, in case I don't want to do it through the boiler. However, when I try it, it takes so long (few minutes) that it doesn't make sense to me. 

What do you think about this? And what is your routine after making your coffee, do you just turn the machine off? If yes, do you have to let the condensed water out when you turn it on again?

Pretty much what the title of this post states. Attending events is NOT ENOUGH when it comes to pursuing membership on the Graduate level. I said in some previous posts that my sister in law, who is NOT interested in Greek Life at all, came to my chapter events ALL THE TIME because she truly likes to volunteer and help people. 

You have to go ABOVE AND BEYOND your comfort zone when it comes to this journey. Attending events is borderline LOW EFFORT. Are you introducing yourself to a new member at every event? Are you going from there and building meaningful relationships and making friends with members? Are you PARTICIPATING in events when you can, asking great questions, commenting on how much you learned or enjoyed the event? Are you arriving on time, looking your best and being pleasant? 

If you have gotten a member's number, are you texting or calling her just to say hi, or asking her how her week was? Remember that we are humans and have LIVES outside of AKA.

When you build that GOOD rapport with a member, and are super comfortable with her, THEN you ask her to lunch or for coffee. We are not going out with people we don't know or aren't comfortable with.

Lastly, YOU MUST VERBALLY EXPRESS INTEREST to the member you have a GOOD, SOLID relationship with.

Someone (a non member) on another thread said that expressing interest is soliciting. NO IT IS NOT. Please look up the definition of SOLICITING. Expressing interest to a member is NOT soliciting.

Oh but I'm an introvert! -- Girl I am too, but you betta BELIEVE I found a way to open my mouth and introduce myself to members, even though it was scary to do so. The more members you meet and introduce yourself to are the various avenues that you may be able to achieve your goal of becoming a member by.

So once again, attending events is borderline basic af. Participate, speak up, make friends, AND verbally express interest.

How do I make friends with members? Well, how do you make friends any other way? You speak and have conversations and find similar interests. Do what you normally do to make friends.

If one person isn't opening up to you, try another and another. This is why you MAKE MULTIPLE friends in the chapter. 

Lastly, this is not a quick thing. It may take, 3, 4, or 5 or MORE years for you. God's timing and all.",1,1733937472.0,AKAgradChapter,1,1.0,False

1hbyigt,https://www.reddit.com/r/WellbeingHypnotherapy/comments/1hbyigt/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.


So, ask yourself: What is one thing from this article that resonates most with you? What small action can you take today to start navigating your life in a healthier way?
And what are your own go to strategies?

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hbyhyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hbyhyd/my_mom_made_my_wedding_all_about_her_and_then/,"My mom made my wedding all about her, and then snubbed me at her wedding a year later. ","After enjoying the lovely Charlotte’s wedding drama videos for the 5000^(th) time, I felt inspired to share my story! The events take place over the course of three years, so strap yourselves in for a long one with my mom as the main character of the drama llama.

 

I (37F) got married to my husband (41M) when I was 22 and he was 26. My husband and I were engaged for almost two years before getting married so I could graduate with my bachelor’s before tying the knot. Those two years, which were supposed to be a happy time, were exhausting, heartbreaking, and overall filled with unnecessary stress 100% originating from my mother.

 

Unfortunately, my mother had her own traumatic childhood, and then my father cheated, left, and married his mistress during my teen years, leaving my mother more bitter than a cup of gas station coffee on a Monday morning. My mother never sought the professional help that I believe would have seriously benefited her. So, by the time my engagement rolled around, she was seriously mentally unwell and took that out on me especially. She refused to engage in wedding talk with me, declined to go wedding dress shopping with me, and would not allow me to access any of the wedding money my father sent her for my big day. I never saw a penny of it; she controlled the finances for my entire wedding. As I was still living with her at the time, I did not have the money to separate from her, and I didn’t even have the mental space to realize how truly toxic she was. We went a year of my engagement without making any plans for my wedding, which made me really sad because I was a young woman excited for this huge milestone in my life. After a year of silence on the subject, my breaking point came when I spent hours of my winter break helping my mother run a community charity event, doing back-breaking lifting of supplies, and being her second in command for this huge event. I was angry, hurt, and frustrated that I was doing all this work for her event on Christmas Day while she was completely unwilling to even talk about my wedding. Well, my mother did not appreciate my “attitude” and, in the end, kicked me out of Christmas. My husband (then-fiancé) picked me up and we spent Christmas Day at a casino (literally the only business open in my area) because his family had already celebrated on Christmas Eve. It was completely depressing, and to this day I still experience some sadness around Christmas – but I’m working through it.

 

After that, my mother would begrudgingly participate in some wedding planning. We went wedding dress shopping once together, but she spent the entire time on her phone with a nasty attitude, so we left with no dress. I later bought my wedding dress shopping with my MOH only, as my mother told me not to invite my grandmother or anyone else, and my mother declined to come.

 

I then made the biggest mistake in my wedding planning: I asked my mother to walk me down the aisle. Every time I think about this decision, I wish I could travel back in time and tell my younger self, “Baby girl, noooo!” You see, after my father had left my mother, he truly left his kids too. He did not ask the courts for visitation time, and we rarely spoke. I did not believe he was the parent who raised me, and I thought I was doing something very kind to my mother. That is when my mother transformed into the true mom-zilla she was born to be. From that point forward, my wedding became all about what dress ***she*** was going to wear in front of God, the guests, and her ex-huband. She became obsessed with looking fantastic but not spending any money because it was my wedding, and she didn’t want a dime of the budget to go to her (she truly is a generous saint!). Her dress was all we ever talked about, and she even refused to let her boyfriend at the time help her buy a dress. My mother became so weird about this dress issue that it caused fights between her and her boyfriend, and they broke up before my wedding (Over the dress. Seriously. I was there when he broke up with her on the phone, and I heard him say how she was driving him crazy!).

 

She talked about this dress issue to everyone who had ears, whether they were listening or not, and would not accept anyone’s help or go shopping for a dress. She finally came home with a dress she borrowed from a friend. Now, my wedding dress was a very fancy ball gown. I mean, I looked like a freaking princess with a tiara and all. All my bridesmaids wore floor-length gowns, and the men rented tuxes. So, in summary, this was a formal wedding party. The dress my mother borrowed from her friend was a knee-length, asymmetrical hem, low cut, spaghetti strap dress that would have been more appropriate on a slutty high school cheerleader for homecoming. At the time, I had a very difficult time asserting myself to my mother due to her explosive reactions and the intense gaslighting I grew up with. However, I wouldn’t be caught dead walking down the aisle with my mother in this sparkly purple disaster of a dress. I told her no, politely, and said the dress was inconsistent with the formal attire of the wedding party. Well, the screaming and waterworks from my mother were unbelievable, and she kept insisting this was the only dress she felt beautiful in, and she wanted to wear it. She kept fighting with me until I told her the dress made her look like a prostitute, and she absolutely could not wear it. The dress issue only resolved a few days before my wedding when she borrowed another dress from a different friend. This dress was a black, form-fitting, halter top with a low cut back and a slit up to her thigh. But it was floor length, not overly revealing, and it was formal enough to fit the bill, so that ended up being her dress.

 

In addition to the year-long drama about her dress, there was also drama about the money and how much my father contributed or did not contribute.  Like I said before, my mother never let me see a penny of the money he sent. As I was a young, broke college student, I was not expecting a big fancy wedding. We did not have a DJ or a limo. Instead, we opted for an iPod with a playlist my hubby and I put together, and we borrowed my sister-in-law’s sports car for the after-ceremony drive-off. While the clothes looked fancy, we got them from David’s Bridal, and all were pretty affordable. We did not have a full dinner, but we served some hefty appetizers with beer, wine, and sodas only. My mother-in-law and sister-in-laws gifted us with the décor, which was DIY, affordable, and very pretty. While I never got the grand total because my mother never let me touch any of the financial parts, I estimate my entire wedding cost $9,000 or less. I did contribute, as I procured a job as a waitress to help get funds to pay for some things on my own, but my mom controlled most of the wedding costs. She determined that my father did not pay enough for the wedding, so after the invitations had gone out, she demanded I uninvite my paternal cousins. She convinced me my father was scamming her, and I obeyed her commands. I completely regret my lack of a spine, and it permanently destroyed my relationship with all my cousins. While I did try to make some repairs, the damage was done and I never had a good relationship with my cousins again. In addition to uninviting my cousins, my mom insisted on downsizing the seating arrangements in our venue. She insisted we did not need seats for everyone, as we were not hosting a dinner and many people would be dancing or mingling, so having enough seating was unnecessary. This, unfortunately, led many people to leave our reception early as they had no place to sit and were uncomfortable. My mother also insisted the daughter of one of her friends be our flower girl, as my husband’s 3 yo nephews were our ring-bearers. I never met this friend until our rehearsal and have not seen them since my wedding. But there is this random little girl in my wedding pictures as our flower girl, just like my mom wanted, even though my husband had a baby girl niece who definitely should have been a part of our wedding. Finally, my mother insisted I invite all of my brother’s close friends (all 6 of them) to be my ushers since they were all my “brothers.” While I generally liked my brother’s friends, I did not have this imaginary close bond my mother insisted I had, but I acquiesced to her insistence. My brother got to have all 6 friends at my wedding, while I had to cut some of my friends from the guest list to manage costs. My mother insisted my friends could come to the “after-party,” unpaid time after the reception at our venue (a local restaurant), where our friends could hang with us and access a cash bar. So, while my friends could not be real guests at our wedding, my brother’s 6 friends were on the official guest list. As ushers, my brother’s friends were meant to seat the guests at the ceremony and direct them to the picture frame I wanted everyone to sign instead of a guest book during the reception. Instead, my brother and his friends left my reception because they were underage and could not drink, went back to my mother’s house to have their own party, and came back to my reception around 11 pm, completely drunk. They took over the microphone and began a karaoke event that broke eardrums and traumatized small children from the horrible caterwauling and screeching their voices made! That is when my husband and I noped out. We left our own wedding, as my brother and his friends had completely taken over, and it was no longer about us.

 

But remember the title of my little story? This story is not just about my own wedding! Nay, nay! In the following year, my mother got married, and, of course, I had to help her with her wedding! Remember how she could not be bothered to discuss my wedding? But her wedding is a different story. I was intimately involved with her wedding details, hearing about her plans to save money by getting married around Christmas time so she could save on decorations, how someone gifted her a wedding band because she didn’t want to spend money on entertainment, etc., etc. I also was charged with accompanying my mother to her wedding dress shopping. Despite my broken heart, I put a smile on my face and told my mother she made a beautiful bride. We found her a lovely dress with a removable train, and I gave her nothing but support. But the final kicker was when she asked my brother to walk her down the aisle and asked me to …… be her photographer. I’m not kidding; my brother was front and center at her wedding while I was reduced to being staff. I’m only in a couple of photos: the large family pictures I had to set up on a timer and run into place.

 

But never fear, this story does have a happy ending! While she broke my heart repeatedly over those three years, she also motivated me to seek the help that I needed. I found a talented, compassionate counselor, established myself in my career, and created the safe and loving home that I never had for my own children. I am also adored and cherished by my mother and father-in-law, and my sister-in-law is one of my closest and best friends. Over the years of healing, I learned how to separate myself from my mother mentally, and we are now VLC, which I think is for the best. I have a beautiful family, a career I’m proud of, and I have the ability to make safe spaces for myself, my children, and my loved ones.  Thank you all for reading, and I love you Charlotte!!!!",5,1733937275.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False
1hbyhr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarpetCleaning/comments/1hbyhr9/best_way_to_clean_carpet_on_stairs/,Best Way to Clean Carpet on Stairs!,"When my sister moved into her new townhouse, she was thrilled about the beautiful carpeted staircase that added warmth and comfort to her home. However, it wasn't long before she realized that keeping those stairs clean would be a challenge. Between her dog tracking in dirt from outside and the occasional coffee spill, the carpet started to look a bit worse for wear.

That's when I stepped in to help. As someone who works for a deep cleaning company, I knew that proper maintenance and the right products could make a huge difference in keeping her staircase looking like new. I suggested a carpet-cleaning machine with a hose and nozzle attachment to reach those awkward corners and edges. Additionally, a powerful enzymatic cleaner could tackle pet stains and odors, while a stain-resistant carpet protector would create an invisible shield against future spills.

Together, we developed a routine that made it easy for my sister to keep her [carpeted stairs clean and fresh](https://chetscleaning.com/blog/best-way-to-clean-carpet-on-stairs/). By vacuuming regularly, treating stains promptly, and using the right cleaning products, she could enjoy the comfort of her carpet without worrying about dirt and mess. Now, her staircase remains a beautiful focal point in her home – and her dog is still allowed to cuddle on the stairs!

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Recently, I decided to try their [Sunday Advent Calendar](https://19grams.coffee/en/products/sonntagskaffee-kalender-rockstar) with a Black Friday deal, which was advertised as “freshly roasted” with 250g bags. What I got were beans roasted a month ago (11.11) and only 200g bags, meaning I’m missing 200g total. It feels like they just sold older coffee for a ""special Black Friday discount"".

I reached out to support to see if there was a mistake and asked if they could offer a refund or credit for a future order—or if I misunderstood the website somehow. They thanked me for pointing it out but said there’s nothing they can do and suggested I contact them before ordering if I have concerns (lol?). After following up and asking if I could return the beans for a full refund, they’ve just ignored me so far.

Did anyone else order this pack and notice it was 200g? Honestly, I think this is pretty poor support and quite disappointing. Not sure what to do—just take it and order somewhere else going forward, or how would you guys handle this?",7,1733937236.0,pourover,15,1.0,False

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I'm taking short 176 - 250 mile flights, which according to SW policy includes service. Out of the 3 segments I've taken today, only one served water and coffee. The others served nothing. The flight attendants on the first one basically had a tray of stale coffee likely from last flight that people didn't want. 

Anyhow, first it was the Southwest Snack Mix change. And now it appears they're completely cutting snacks altogether along short routes which is the majority of routes for Southwest. This includes DAL-HOU, HOU-SAT, HOU- AUS, HOU - MSY, etc. since these flights usually cruise at 26k feet. This will save the company millions yearly. And that's the entire reason they did it.

I'm new to the espresso game. Looking to buy something to replace the cheap Nespresso-cups machine we currently have in our home with something of higher quality.

My wife and I usually drink our coffee on the go, before we get in our car to drive to work. So preferably we would want something that doesn't take a lot of time and doesn't require a lot of maintenance and or cleaning. On work days we always drink our coffee black, but when we have guests or when I'm working from home, from time to time, I like to add some milk.

Via my work, I have a 30% reduction on the Sage website so I was thinking of buying our new machine there.

At first I wanted to buy the Barista Express, but then I read that the Barista Pro (which would cost me 60 euro's more) is far superior and more durable and worth the extra cost.

After reading on this reddit however, I see a lot of people who claim the Bambino plus with a separate grinder. I fear however that two machines will require more maintenance, more cleaning and make the process of making a cup of coffee in the morning, slower.

The barista pro would cost me the same as the Bambino plus with Smart Grinder pro.

I want to add that I'm not a coffee nut who wants to experiment with his coffee machine. I like good coffee and at work, I'm capable of doing a 30 minutes detour just to go to a good coffee bar, but I'm a fan of the drinking, not the whole brewing process. I'll probably fine tune the grind until I find the right density and settings and then leave it on those settings for years.",1,1733937069.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Me? I'm just searching for a partner in crime who's as passionate about life as she is about her dreams.

Picture this: *Stolen glances over steaming coffee, spontaneous weekend adventures, sharing those moments where the world seems to pause just for us. I'm not just looking for a relationship, but a partnership that feels like coming home.*

**My World:**
- IT professional with a wanderlust spirit
- Roots in Europe and a heart in Moscow
- Music lover who finds poetry in everything from Kendrick to Coldplay, from Swift to Rammstein.
- Dreamer with plans to grow, learn, and create something meaningful

I'm in a transitional phase - planning to return to uni, expanding my skills, and exploring ways to contribute meaningfully to the world. My ideal partner would be someone who understands that life isn't about having all the answers, but about being willing to ask the right questions.

**What I'm Dreaming Of:**
- A connection that feels effortless yet profound, the type of love that challenges and supports in equal measure
- A partner under 30, based in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or Central/Eastern Europe (with a soft spot for Poland, but open to other countries)
- Have a spark of passion for something that makes your eyes light up
Someone who sees the world with wonder and depth
- A partner to build dreams with - in Moscow, St. Petersburg, or across Central/Eastern Europe

I'm not interested in surface-level, temporary interactions. I want to understand your dreams, fears, hopes - and share mine in return. Someone who can sit in comfortable silence, challenge my perspectives, and walk beside me as we both evolve.
Bonus points if you can recommend a book that changed your worldview, or share a dream that keeps you awake at night.

Here's my case:

1) McDonald's has always sided with Trump. They use him as a vehicle for free advertising, always has and probably always will. He hosted a White House dinner with McDonald's crap. They let him pretend to be a worker to win over the voters. The media posted pictures of Trump and his groveling cronies eating McDonald's on the plane shortly after his ""victory"". And McDonald's conveniently stayed mute through all of this, never calling him out. 

2) Don't forget the hot coffee controversy. McDonald's went all out to discredit the poor old lady whose labia got fused when she spilled their grossly overheated coffee on her lap, and succeeded. This also led to congress passing a limit on torts in lawsuits against corporations that wronged customers. 

3) McDonald's cheered on the fact that their brainwashed, class-traitor employee snitched on Luigi, and the arrest happened at one of their restaurants. Again, using controversy for free advertising. 

4) They have been underpaying and overworking their employees for decades, and lobbied hard against workers' rights and increase in minimum wage. They also have cut down on the number of employees per shift, making it exhausting for them to keep up with the customers' orders. It also makes customers wait a lot longer to get their orders. ""Fast food"", my ass.

5) They let the quality of their food go to shit, and jacked the prices way up because they knew how dumb the average Americans are. Their food always has been poison, and they knowingly kill thousands of Americans annually and don't give a fuck because of profits. 

Seriously, wake up. Stop overpaying for their insanely priced poison junk, and give McDonald's the middle finger. Forever. They need to be sent a message that this is unacceptable.",205,1733936955.0,antiwork,55,0.88,False

and guess what – the more i focus on me, the less i care about the “what ifs” or “maybes” the silence that used to feel so loud now feels...peaceful like instead of being lonely, i’m finally alone in the best way

don’t get me wrong, i’m not swearing off dating or anything but i realize that being with someone just to avoid loneliness? not worth it i’d rather wait for someone who doesn’t make me question my worth or my gut

and the best part? people are noticing the shift in me my friends keep saying i seem lighter happier and honestly? they’re right coz cutting off the drama doesn’t just free me from him it frees me from the version of myself that thinks i need someone else to feel whole

* Like I said, video editor (kinda cool for a boring desk job). I mostly work in documentary, which is nice because I get to work with a lot of different formats and stuff.
* I’m a fan of conversational writing, if not evidenced by this post. I tend to write letters similarly.
* I am a huge dork for history. Something about the past feeling alive, especially in places I can visit, is so fun for me. Any postcard with an obscure historical site, or a cute drawing of something old, is a favorite.
* I enjoy sitting in coffee shops to write. This is not unique, I know, but all the same!
* I love Baseball. Another “the fact that it’s really old interests me” kind of thing. I also love the communal feeling of rooting for the same team.
* I take a lot of film photography, but that’s no promise that I’m good at it. I just like the feeling of doing everything manually sometimes, and photography gives me a way to do that without having to, like, work on cars or something similar where I’d need more space. If you want to send photos back and forth, I’d be into that!
* I am a huge nerd in general. Video games, genre films, anime. I love digging into any culture hole. I once spent a whole day reading about the history of flash games.
* I also sometimes like drawing little doodles on post-cards
* My music taste is pretty eclectic and unexplainable, but it ranges from indie rock to Japanese jazz. Speaking of-
* I am currently learning Japanese, and know a very tiny bit of Italian. If you write in either of these languages, I’d love to practice with you, if you don’t mind! Expect my performance to be lackluster.

Ok, that’s probably enough for now! If you’re interested, shoot me a DM and we’ll get to know each other, maybe exchange addresses to send some physical letters!",1,1733936772.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

he kept texting begging to explain himself so i decided fine let’s hear him out not coz i cared but coz i wanted to end this mess with style we met for coffee and y’all i walked in like i owned the place confident calm and unbothered

he starts stumbling through his excuses “it’s complicated” this “dog” that blah blah blah and i just sat there sipping my latte like mmhmm go on as if i wasn’t already planning my exit halfway through

when he hit me with the “i’m falling for you” line i literally smiled and said “that’s sweet but i deserve someone who’s all in not someone half out of a situationship” his face was priceless

then i stood up dropped a tip on the table and said “good luck sorting things out but i’m not waiting around for you to figure out your life” and walked out without looking back no drama no yelling just me knowing my worth and leaving with my dignity intact

he’s texted since but guess what he’s blocked coz i’m not here to babysit grown men who can’t be honest or handle their own lives

moral of the story: trust your gut and don’t settle for half-hearted efforts or messy situations i’m done with the mazes i’m building my own forest where the only green flag is me thriving

1hby3ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness_India/comments/1hby3ht/basics_of_diet_plan_designing/,Basics of diet plan designing ,"I see a lot of people confused about their diets so here's the basic plan I follow and why I follow it. 

I resistance train 3 times a week and on the days I train, I eat 3 meals. On rest days I follow 2MAD (2 meals a day). There's no special reason for this, it's simply personal preference. On rest days instead of breakfast I have black coffee. And on workout days I train on an empty stomach first thing in the morning with pre-workout (pre-workout supplement, not meal).

Breakfast and dinner stay the same every day. I have multiple flavours of whey and various types/brands of muesli/oats so I keep switching them up but the macros more or less stay the same. 

Breakfast (On workout days):
50g muesli 
50g whey concentrate 
Total calories ~400, total protein ~40g.

Dinner:
5 scrambled eggs (half tbsp ghee, salt, pepper)
Amul blueberry protein shake
Total calories ~600, total protein ~50.

As for lunch, I eat whatever is cooked at home. So this changes everyday. I don't measure the calories of this meal accurately because it's a hassle and I'm pretty good at eyeballing. Protein I do track and if there's not enough protein in this meal, I add mango flavoured whey into some curd to reach 50g+ protein target. I also make sure to include salad with this meal along with something for gut health. Today I had carrots and fermented alma for example. This is my biggest meal of the day and usually has between 1200-1500 calories. 

My protein goal on workout days is 140-150 and on rest days is 100-120. As you can see, this is a hassle free diet plan. Since my breakfast and dinner are the same everyday, meal prep and tracking becomes really easy. As for total calorie intake, it changes slightly on a daily basis. I will suggest y'all not to be neurotic about hitting the exact calorie goals daily, rather focus more on weekly calorie intake/target. 

For supplements I take ~3g creatine, triple strength omega 3, Vitamin D3, magnesium glycinate daily. I also take a multivitamin 3 times a week. And ofc whey and amul blueberry shake as needed. 

On some rest day I have coffee with milk and sugar instead of black, and the total calories for that is around 200 calories. I don't track carbs and fats, only protein and total calories.

1hby0l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hby0l3/my_partner_is_fudging_up_our_short_period_of_long/,My partner is fudging up our short period of long distance and i dont know if it is worth it,"So I (23M) got into a relationship with someone in mid October with my current partner 24(F), after a fairly toxic breakup with a long distance relationship with this woman I thought I was going to marry. My current partner, got out of hers in June, it was an abusive relationship. 

 A little history about us and her, 

We hooked up last August in 2023, and she had feelings for the partner that she had started dating right after. Basically, she was in a 4- year long distance relationship before that, and she cheated by kissing her most recent ex. They broke up, and she caught feelings for this guy, who then had a casual relationship with her, she caught feelings and he strung her along, till he called it off. 8 months later, he became sort of a friend of mine at uni, because he looked up to me on some stuff. I was out of a very toxic break up, so was only looking to hook up and focussing on making it as an investment banker. Coming back to us, when he found out we were hooking up, he suddenly confessed his love for her, and then they got into a relationship, I didnt talk to her for a few days, but she called me crying and wanted me to stay on as her friend. 

Three weeks later, I got into a relationship with an ex of mine, we broke up because of the long distance, but decided to try it again once more. Our relationship was good at the beginning, in the first two months of long distance, but turned sour in last 7 months. Parallely, her and the ex kept the fighting on- at least twice a week- at the begin, and he would come to me for advice on how to sort them, and I had a hunch of what she wanted so I would give him the advice and they would sort it out.

We stayed as friends, it always felt one sided, she would say that her ex is jealous of me, and everytime I tried to step out or ask her to distance she would get mad at me and throw a fit. She soon moved in with her ex, and I started travelling to Singapore for my internship, and we started growing apart- she would still contact me with her problems, things were still going sort of strong with my ex with constant fights here and there. My mother caught cancer, so the travel increased and my ex and I started growing apart, during which time, my current partner never cared to check in on how she was doing. 

Then one day in Late June, after not talking to each other for about 20 days, she asked if she could crash at mine, because her ex had said a lot of rude stuff to her, misbehaved with her and her mom when she visited, and she revealed in the last few months had slapped her too, he was very toxic and I knew that since day one. So I encouraged her to leave her relationship. 

I helped her get back on her feet, allowed her to stay at mine- fighting with my roommates, woke her up for her experiments and research presentations ( she is doing her PhD) while I was in a different timezone, booked cabs for her ( I had uber credit from my workplace) and fed her when I could. Many times, I would get rude with her when she would get lazy, I feel I was personally invested in her success at her work, so she would throw a fit, and blame me for forcing her into interactions with my friends after she lost her entire friend circle. 

Soon after, I called off my relationship because my ex couldn’t handle my work, and we started drinking a lot and cuddling with each other and sleeping in the same bed, I realised I was catching feelings for her so decided to step away, until she told me she was catching feelings for me too, I was supposed to take a week long trip to see my mum, and she told me she really wanted to kiss me, and so I did, and we started our relationship. 

Now coming to our relationship, 

The first week was on long distance and it went well, but ever since there have been constant fights with each other, and constant arguments about everything. Her sister wanted to ask me a few questions about my work to check whether I am a nepo baby, and whether what I do is sustainable, I felt like it was an audit of me, and I mentioned it to my sister. My partner overheard this conversation, and she got mad at me for telling my sister. 

There were many such instances: 

The first was with telling our friends about the relationship, I initially wanted to keep the relationship to ourself, but she did not want to be my ‘secret’. I did not want to particularly tell this common friend of ours, because he had been touchy with her, about a week  prior to the relationship, but she cited him being one of her only friends. Two weeks into the relationship, she asked me on point, in front of a really close friend of mine about whether I wanted to tell her, I announced our relationship to that friend hesitantly. The same night I had a party to attend without her, and two of my other exes were going to be there, my friends including the ‘touchy’ friend ( who btw I don’t believe to be touchy for reasons I will disclose later in the thread) was joking about this, and me getting with them, and she overheard. So she told the ‘touchy’ friend about our relationship so that she could keep tabs on me at this party.

Then after that, we were going to a party a week later, she got mad at me for not complementing her for how she looked, and trying too hard to cover our relationship. At the party, there was this guy that was staring at her, and the minute she told me about it, I parellely told her about how everyone at the party thought she was too touchy with every other guy. We fought for two hours at 3 am in the morning.

She keeps complaining about how I never opened up to her, but every time I try it feels like I am being mocked. I opened up to her about being adopted- she made a joke out of that, I opened up to her about my anxieties around work- she makes a joke about how I overthink my work as an investment banker every now and then, because it is a menial job, and because my internship is largely online, she also every now and then makes fun of how ‘idle’ I am, because on almost a daily basis, I make her lunch and get her coffee every morning. I don’t care much for these, because her ex used to crack such demeaning jokes from time to time about her, and these were exactly things that she faced in her previous relationship, having no recognition for what she did for him. Many instances have happened where she says that I don’t care to tell her things, or check in on her, and she has fought with me on the same. For example, I was sick last month, and we were fighting because I brought up the fact that I didn’t like her calling me ‘idle’ when I have a lot of work, I had a fever, and I told her, my voice had evidently changed. A friend who called noticed, and got me soup at night, while she was enjoying with her roommate, and didnt care to check in once. When she came home that night, she started crying, without acknowledging my concern, she did get me green tea and honey, six hours later- but gave me shit for not asking her first.

My birthday last month was the first time I noticed these red flags, I was away from uni, deciding to celebrate my birthday with my parents one last time before I graduated, and because we would only get the time for long distance calls she would get mad. On my birthday, she just sent me a tick mark message to wish me, and got mad at how all of my female best friends were posting stuff for me. She got me my milk tea of choice and mangoes before I left, and dinner too. But after that, she told me about how she feels inferior, and how she cannot spend enough money on me, because she is not as rich as me. She told me her relationship with her ex was easier, because he did not have a lot of friends doing things for him. I felt bad about the fact that she got him a $350 watch and made a whole photo album for him- and she has only been better financially since last year, because she has started getting a stipend. I got a lot of shit for that. The next day she got mad at me, because I told her that I hurt my back, when my friend was trying to cheer me up, she held my hand and the both of us tripped, she made a whole ruckus out of it, saying that she cannot ever trust me, despite me having never cheated in a relationship ( she has cheated on her partner of 4 years but, I didnt bring it up)

Finally, at a birthday party of a friend, she wanted to make our relationship public, because the toxic ex’s best friend came for that, and I had my misgivings, but she gave me shit for that too, and ended up doing it anyway

TL;DR:These are some of the instances, I have just ignored most of the shit she says, she is not the person that I thought she was, and I have taken her off that pedestal. Recently, my lease on my current living situation ended, and she asked me to move in with her, I said yes for now, and came to singapore for my internship, and has returned to her tantrums, given a screenshot in the chat I have blurred the names, she was talking to her sister. 

I need help navigating this situation, I dont know how to handle these things in a long distance where I share my concerns and she just uses the react button. How should I share my concerns in a way that she does not brush them off? Is this even a real relationship that is worth pursuing? I am moving to US for my MBA in 2 years, should I even keep up with this?",1,1733936102.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

I've been using the 1:2 ratio, i.e. 18gr IN 36gr OUT, but I'm getting 36gr before 20sec of extraction, I've been pressing the coffee well, even when I throw it away it comes out all over (like a well-compacted puck).

Could you please advise me on what I can do to improve extraction? At the moment I've been using Illy Arabica Selection Brasil (cerrado mineiro) and today Lince Brasil from Hidden Coffees, whose variety is Catuaí, will be arriving.

1hbxy8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockNavigators/comments/1hbxy8t/promising_african_currencies_on_the_forex_market/,Promising African Currencies on the Forex Market: Opportunities and Insights,"The Forex market is a dynamic space, often dominated by major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. However, for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and explore emerging opportunities, African currencies present an intriguing avenue. While not as liquid as the majors, several African currencies offer unique prospects due to the continent's rapid economic growth, resource abundance, and improving financial infrastructure.

Below, we’ll delve into some of the most interesting African currencies on Forex, examining their current trends and potential for traders.

**1. South African Rand (ZAR): The Regional Leader**

The South African Rand is the most traded African currency on the Forex market. It is often viewed as a proxy for broader sentiment about emerging markets, particularly those in Africa. Factors that make the Rand stand out include:

* **Economic Fundamentals:** South Africa has a well-established financial system, and its economy benefits from rich natural resources, particularly gold and platinum.
* **Volatility:** The ZAR is known for its sharp moves, making it appealing to traders who thrive on price fluctuations.
* **Global Influence:** The Rand is often influenced by global commodity prices, U.S. Federal Reserve decisions, and geopolitical events.

For traders, ZAR offers high potential returns but also significant risk due to its sensitivity to both domestic and global factors.

**2. Nigerian Naira (NGN): The Oil Connection**

Nigeria is Africa's largest economy and the continent’s top oil producer, making the Nigerian Naira a currency to watch. While NGN is not widely traded on global Forex platforms, its movement is deeply tied to oil prices, offering indirect trading opportunities.

* **Strengths:** Nigeria's economy is diversifying, with growing sectors like technology and agriculture complementing its oil dominance.
* **Challenges:** Currency controls and inflation have historically made the Naira less stable, but ongoing reforms may enhance its appeal.

Traders interested in NGN often track oil price trends and the government's monetary policies for insights.

**3. Egyptian Pound (EGP): A Stable Performer**

The Egyptian Pound has been relatively stable in recent years, supported by Egypt's growing economy and robust foreign direct investment (FDI). Key points about EGP include:

* **Tourism and Suez Canal Revenue:** Egypt benefits significantly from tourism and income from the Suez Canal, both of which contribute to currency stability.
* **Economic Reforms:** Recent reforms, including floating the currency in 2016, have increased transparency and attracted foreign investment.

For Forex traders, EGP might not offer the wild swings of other currencies, but its stability makes it a solid choice for risk-averse investors.

**4. Kenyan Shilling (KES): A Gateway to East Africa**

The Kenyan Shilling is an important currency in East Africa, reflecting the country’s role as a regional economic hub. Kenya's economy is driven by agriculture, tourism, and a burgeoning tech sector.

* **Stability:** The Central Bank of Kenya has actively managed the Shilling to ensure stability, making it less volatile than some other African currencies.
* **Growth Potential:** As Kenya continues to attract foreign investors, KES could gain more visibility on the global Forex stage.

Traders interested in KES often monitor tea, coffee, and horticulture export data, as these are major contributors to Kenya's economy.

**5. Ghanaian Cedi (GHS): A Rising Star**

Ghana is one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, thanks to its gold, cocoa, and oil exports. The Ghanaian Cedi has shown resilience and presents opportunities for traders seeking exposure to West Africa.

* **Economic Growth:** Ghana's GDP growth consistently outpaces many of its peers, attracting foreign capital.
* **Challenges:** Inflation and government debt remain concerns, but ongoing economic reforms aim to stabilize the Cedi.

For Forex traders, GHS offers a mix of growth potential and risk, influenced heavily by commodity prices and fiscal policies.

**6. Botswana Pula (BWP): A Hidden Gem**

The Botswana Pula is one of Africa's strongest currencies, reflecting the country's stable political environment and prudent economic management. Key highlights include:

* Mining Revenue: Botswana is a leading diamond producer, and its currency benefits from the country's strong mining sector.
* Regional Stability: The Pula is less volatile than many African currencies, offering a more predictable trading experience.

Traders may find BWP appealing for its relative stability and exposure to Southern Africa’s economic trends.

**Key Considerations for Trading African Currencies**

While African currencies offer exciting opportunities, there are unique challenges to consider:

1. Liquidity: Most African currencies are not as liquid as major pairs, leading to wider spreads and limited market depth.
2. Volatility: Economic and political developments can cause significant price swings.
3. Regulation and Accessibility: Not all Forex brokers offer access to African currencies, and local regulations may affect trading conditions.

**Tools for Trading African Currencies**

For traders exploring African currencies, platforms like [TradingView](https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsDayTraders/comments/1gbvh06/tradingview_premium_free_edition_desktop_pc/) can be invaluable. TradingView provides access to technical analysis tools, customizable charts, and data for both major and less common currency pairs. By using TradingView, you can track African currencies, analyze trends, and make informed trading decisions with ease.

**Closing remarks**

African currencies represent a frontier of opportunities in the Forex market. From the high volatility of the South African Rand to the stability of the Botswana Pula, there’s a wide range of options for traders willing to explore beyond the major pairs. While challenges like liquidity and geopolitical risks remain, the potential rewards make African currencies an attractive choice for the adventurous trader.

Despite the mixed reviews that machine gets on this forum, I've been absolutely loving it. I have three latte macchiatos a day and it's enough of a treat that I look forward to getting out of bed in the morning.  Houseguests keep complementing me on it too. 

This summer, I finally purchased that vacation home near the beach I've always wanted.  I got a Bosch 800 with the Costco deal ($1200).  So far, I'm completely unimpressed. Yeah, it has a much fancier interface and WiFi connectivity. So what? I don't drink the interface. 

Milk drinks are way too cold - even by superautomatic standards. It does have a built in cup warmer and I've got it set up to warm a cup as soon as I get out of bed in the morning, but I doubt that will help. 

Expresso itself is fine, but really no different than a much less expensive Phillips. 

I know posters here are always saying that you need to let a machine get settled before making a judgement but I honestly did not have that issue with my Phillips. It was making great coffee from day one. 

The only real advantage I've seen with this expressive machine so far is that did a much better job of actually varying foam intensity.  With the lattego system, a cappuccino is just a latte macchiato with less milk.

My parents have kept this house and have been renting it out since we moved out when I was 8 years old. Once me and my cousin graduated from college they said they would let us move in. We ended up moving in July of 2022 and previous to that me and my cousin were roommates in college so we’ve lived together since 2016. She’s my best friend and our mothers are sisters so I consider her to be like a sister to me. We’ve pretty much been attached to the hip since birth but we both ended up getting into relationships towards the end of 2022 and it’s kind of caused us to drift apart a bit.

So I don’t have the best relationship with her boyfriend (25M) because I feel like he’s a bit of a user. Overall nice guy, but he doesn’t have a real job (he raps so he gets paid for gigs and has side jobs he gets paid for but nothing consistent), he lives with his uncle so he’s constantly at our house (spends the night 4 to 5 times a week), doesn’t have a car so my cousin is constantly driving him around (and he lives 45 minutes away), and on top of that they were in a situationship for over a year until my cousin broke it off and eventually begged for her back. So as you can imagine as someone who is like a sister to me I’m not too keen on him. I also want to add that since moving into this house I’ve purchased every single piece of furniture in here. We have a couch and a coffee table that we split from when we lived together in college but other than that she doesn’t contribute to anything else other than bills. My dad and boyfriend do yard work, my dad or I clean the pool, and I have a garden that I upkeep. Her boyfriend also smokes marijuana religiously. I was a pretty chronic smoker in college and I still smoke now as like a night cap every now and then so I’m not one to judge, but I work from home and again he does not have a job so he sits in the house and smokes sun up to sun down and the house smells like weed all the time. 

Love her to death, but I’m constantly going to my boyfriend’s house just so I don’t have to deal with her boyfriend 24/7. I’ve also never been in a serious relationship before (or anything other than situationships) and I’ve been with my boyfriend (27M) for over 2 years now and we want to live together at this point. The issue is I know if I let my boyfriend move in my cousin would ask the same. As you can imagine I just don’t want to live with him and if my boyfriend were to move in I’d no longer have the option to just go to his place when I don’t want to deal with them. We also all have pets and I can’t fathom 4 pets and 4 humans in this house. I know it’s selfish which is why I’m having such a debate over this and I don’t want to ruin the relationship I have with her. The fact is we’ve lived together for 8 years and we’re both in completely different phases of life right now. I considered moving elsewhere with my boyfriend but I have the better house and don’t want to uproot all that I have here just so my cousin can stay. Again, as I type this I feel so selfish even thinking this but I have no idea how to go about this without ruining our relationship. Our family is SUPER close and I just know it’d be the topic of conversation. I’ve never gotten this off my chest because I don’t want my entire family knowing her personal business or mine. I would love any advice if someone is dealing with something similar and please be nice. Thanks for reading my whole spiel if you did lol ",3,1733935684.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

[Cocktails at 124 Guest House Brighton](https://preview.redd.it/44pccq6m096e1.jpg?width=5328&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1c765e28df46cdf53db3f7269e436422f2673b9)

# Trading Post Coffee

This place is a lifesaver when I need a solid caffeine fix. With several locations across Brighton, my favourites are:

* **Western Road**: A quieter spot, perfect for a chilled coffee run.
* **Ship Street**: Great for outdoor seating and people-watching.
* **Kensington Gardens**: Ideal after wandering through the iconic Brighton Lanes.

They offer a range of coffee beans, so there’s always something new to try, and the warm atmosphere makes it perfect for solo moments or catching up with mates.

# 124 Guest House

This recent addition to Kingsway has quickly become a go-to spot. The mix of modern and traditional decor creates a stunning, cosy vibe. My highlights:

* The **indoor-outdoor terrace** under a glass roof is dreamy.
* **Cocktails** are on point.
* Freshly baked pizza + people-watching in summer? Yes, please!

It’s chic without being pretentious, and I can’t wait for sunny days here.

# Shelter Hall

For casual dining with a twist, Shelter Hall on the seafront is unbeatable. With loads of food options—Mexican, Italian, and more—it’s great for groups who can’t agree on what to eat. Bonus points for the live entertainment that keeps the vibe buzzing.

# Brighton Beach House (Soho House)

This is *the* ultimate hangout. From the warm welcome to the incredible social events (think cocktail classes, wellbeing workshops, and Drag Bingo), it feels more like a community than just a bar.

* The **terrace views** over the sea are unmatched.
* The food and service are consistently top-notch.
* And yes, the Cowshed hand soap in the loos is a bougie little detail I secretly love.

# 17 Grams

Close to my office in Portslade, this is my go-to for a lunchtime coffee or quick snack. The cakes are irresistible, the coffee hits the spot, and the friendly vibe keeps me coming back. Plus, they’ve got Aesop hand soap in the washroom—those little things always get me.

# Rockwater

Perched on the Hove seafront, Rockwater is a year-round favourite.

* **Summer**: Relaxed drinks by the beach.
* **Winter**: Snuggled by the fire, drink in hand, watching the waves crash outside.

The food’s fab, and the whole vibe is effortlessly chill.

# Centre Stage

For a fun, unapologetically camp night out, Centre Stage is unbeatable. Think fabulous drag acts, DJs spinning gay pop anthems, and a crowd that’s always up for a laugh. If you’re craving glitter, good vibes, and unforgettable memories, this is the spot!

# Other Favourites

If you’re bar-hopping around Brighton, here are a few more worth checking out:

* **The Plotting Parlour**: Speakeasy vibes with expertly crafted cocktails.
* **The Mesmerist**: Quirky decor, great drinks, and live music.
* **The Black Dove**: Eclectic and cosy, with creative cocktails.
* **Patterns**: DJs, a lively atmosphere, and a seafront terrace.

I’ve never had such a strong reaction as I’ve had today though!

I took Niacin 500 mg about 2 hours ago. I also took a general B complex at the same time. About 45 mins into it, I started to get the flush. That’s normal and I fully expected it. However, I suddenly got really bad stomach cramps, similar to menstrual cramps. I also got diarrhea several times and super dizzy. I legit wondered if I had to call 911 because I felt so out of it. 

I had to cancel a work meeting just so I could go lay down on the couch. I’ve since tried eating a snack of some chips, since all I’ve had today is coffee and a protein shake. I also took some ibuprofen, since I read that can help with the flush.

Now, the flush seems to be subsiding, as is the diarrhea and stomach cramps. But I’m legit TREMBLING, as if I was freezing. Like my hands are shaking as I type this.

1hbxs5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1hbxs5p/teeth_whitening_before_and_after/,Teeth Whitening Before And After,"The Impact of Teeth Whitening: Real Before and After Results
------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has surged in popularity over the past several years, with many people eager to see the transformation it can bring to their smiles. When one considers undergoing a teeth whitening treatment, the before and after results play a crucial role in making that decision. Many individuals can share personal testimonies showcasing dramatic improvements that enhance their overall appearance and boost confidence.

Before diving into the specifics of the results, it’s important to understand the various methods available for teeth whitening. From in-office procedures to at-home kits, the approach you choose impacts both the effectiveness and the final outcome. Here’s a quick look at some common options:

- **In-office whitening:** Performed by dental professionals, these treatments yield immediate, noticeable results. Using powerful whitening agents, results can often be seen in just one appointment.
- **At-home whitening kits:** These kits include trays, strips, or gels that you apply over a period of days or weeks. While more convenient, they may take longer to deliver noticeable results.
- **Whitening toothpastes:** These are a less intense option that can help remove surface stains over time. However, they may not provide the dramatic changes that other methods do.
- **Natural remedies:** Some people explore using baking soda or activated charcoal. While these can gently whiten teeth, the effectiveness can vary significantly.

Now, let’s focus on the real impact of teeth whitening through notable before and after results. Many individuals report a significant transformation in their smiles, which can lead to various psychological benefits.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
People who undergo teeth whitening treatments often express a newfound sense of confidence. This confidence shines through in social and professional situations, leading to more smiles and open interactions. The change in appearance can be so impactful that some individuals report feeling more attractive, which can enhance personal relationships and even career opportunities.

Visual comparisons tell a compelling story. Before whitening, teeth may appear dull, stained, or yellowed due to factors like coffee, tea, or smoking. After treatment, many individuals enjoy a brighter, more radiant smile. This stark contrast can be a powerful motivation for those contemplating the treatment. Photos of before and after smiles often reveal significant whitening, bringing back a youthful glow that resonates with an individual’s overall look.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
However, it’s important to maintain realistic expectations. Different factors influence how much whiter your teeth can become, such as:

- **Initial tooth shade:** Everyone starts with a different base color, and this can determine the final results.
- **Type of treatment:** In-office treatments often yield quicker and more noticeable results compared to at-home kits.
- **Oral hygiene habits:** Good dental care enhances the longevity of whitening results, while poor habits may reverse gains more quickly.
- **Dietary factors:** Consumption of staining foods and drinks should be limited to maintain the brightness of your teeth.

Another significant aspect to consider is the health of your teeth. While teeth whitening is generally safe, individuals with sensitive teeth or existing dental issues should consult with their dentist before proceeding. In some cases, professional guidance can help you choose the right method that minimizes discomfort while still providing outstanding results.

## Demystifying GPU Detection Challenges

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fi08htvz86e1.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25b6402a5061fb5b64ea9aa5723bc0b2807cfd10

&#x200B;

Imagine you're working on a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of GPUs for computation, but a mysterious issue blocks your progress. You invoke **nvmlDeviceGetCount()**, fully expecting to see your GPUs listed, yet it returns a device count of 0. Confusingly, there’s no error reported, leaving you in a bind. 😕

Despite the perplexing results from the NVML function, tools like **nvidia-smi** can detect these devices, and your CUDA kernels execute seamlessly. It's like spotting your car in the driveway but being unable to start it because the keys seem invisible! This situation highlights a discrepancy that many developers face when working with **CUDA** and NVML APIs.

To make things even more intriguing, your system’s configuration appears to check all the right boxes. Running on Devuan GNU/Linux with a modern kernel and CUDA version 12.6.68, your environment should theoretically be optimized for GPU functionality. Yet, something critical is missing in the communication chain.

In this article, we’ll dive into potential reasons why **nvmlDeviceGetCount()** behaves this way. Through relatable examples and expert insights, you’ll discover practical debugging strategies to get your GPUs recognized by NVML. 🚀 Stay tuned!

### Decoding GPU Detection with NVML

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/160i2diwz86e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbeb47d43c109b5de1ae33ccda38953abc699bb8

&#x200B;

The scripts provided earlier aim to diagnose and resolve the issue of **nvmlDeviceGetCount** returning 0 devices. They leverage NVIDIA's NVML library, a powerful API for managing and monitoring GPU devices. The first script, written in Python, demonstrates a straightforward way to initialize NVML, query the GPU count, and retrieve information about each detected GPU. It begins by calling **nvmlInit**, which sets up the environment for GPU management. This step is crucial because failing to initialize NVML means no GPU operations can proceed. Imagine starting your day without coffee; you’re functional but far from optimal! ☕

After initialization, the script uses **nvmlDeviceGetCount** to determine how many GPUs are present. If it returns 0, it’s a sign of potential configuration or environment issues rather than actual hardware absence. This part of the script mirrors a troubleshooting approach: asking the system, ""What GPUs can you see?"" The error-handling block ensures that if this step fails, the developer gets a clear error message to guide further debugging. It's like having a GPS that not only says you're lost but tells you why! 🗺️

The C++ version of the script showcases a more robust and performant approach, often preferred for production environments. By calling **nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex**, it accesses each GPU device sequentially, allowing detailed queries such as retrieving the device name with **nvmlDeviceGetName**. These commands work together to construct a detailed map of the GPU landscape. This is particularly useful in setups with multiple GPUs, where identifying each device and its capabilities is vital for load distribution and optimization.

Both scripts end by shutting down NVML with **nvmlShutdown**, which ensures that all allocated resources are released. Skipping this step could lead to memory leaks or unstable behavior in long-running systems. These scripts are not just diagnostic tools; they’re foundational for managing GPUs in computational setups. For instance, if you're deploying a machine-learning model that needs specific GPUs, these scripts help verify that everything is ready to go before the heavy lifting begins. By integrating these checks into your workflow, you create a resilient system that’s always prepared for GPU-intensive tasks. 🚀

### Understanding GPU Accessibility Issues with NVML

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6l4rkf9yz86e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa9c6ab2e8b5c12f916dbe4b8823e3f330dc1a10

&#x200B;

One critical aspect often overlooked when **nvmlDeviceGetCount** returns 0 is the role of system permissions. The NVML library interacts directly with NVIDIA drivers, which may require elevated privileges. If the script or application invoking these commands lacks the necessary access rights, NVML may fail to detect devices. Consider a scenario where a developer executes the script as a regular user instead of root or using sudo—this can result in NVML functions behaving as if no GPUs are present. 🖥️

Another potential culprit could be driver mismatches or incomplete installations. NVML heavily depends on the NVIDIA driver stack, so any incompatibility or missing components can cause issues. For example, updating the CUDA toolkit without updating the corresponding driver can lead to such discrepancies. This highlights the importance of verifying driver versions using tools like **nvidia-smi**, which can confirm that the driver is loaded and functional.

Finally, the kernel version and OS configuration can also play a part. On customized Linux distributions like Devuan GNU/Linux, kernel modifications or missing dependencies might interfere with NVML's functionality. To mitigate this, developers should ensure that kernel modules like **nvidia.ko** are correctly loaded and verify system logs for any errors related to GPU initialization. This layered approach to debugging can save time and ensure your GPUs are recognized and ready for action! 🚀

#### Addressing Common Questions About NVML GPU Detection

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/26t9jkuyz86e1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=caa1e170efbc1b104a36fd6478bc0fb558cb9f2c

&#x200B;

Why does **nvmlDeviceGetCount** return 0?

This typically happens due to permission issues, incompatible drivers, or missing kernel modules. Running the script with elevated privileges can help.

Can **nvidia-smi** detect GPUs even if NVML can't?

Yes, because **nvidia-smi** operates differently and can sometimes bypass issues that affect NVML.

What role does **nvmlInit** play in this process?

It initializes NVML and is mandatory for any GPU-related queries to function. Without it, no NVML command will work.

Is it possible to use **nvmlDeviceGetHandleByIndex** if the device count is 0?

No, because this command depends on a valid GPU count. A count of 0 means there are no devices to query.

How do I check driver compatibility?

Use **nvidia-smi** to confirm driver versions and compare them against the CUDA version for compatibility.

#### Resolving GPU Detection Mysteries

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6zao7kfzz86e1.jpg?width=1155&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4680bbc36293059a748aaa24dc184cee2596990a

&#x200B;

When facing NVML returning 0 devices, start by checking system permissions and running your scripts with elevated privileges. This ensures that NVML can access GPU-related resources effectively. Such small tweaks often resolve many detection problems quickly. 😊

Additionally, verifying driver compatibility and ensuring kernel modules like **nvidia.ko** are loaded can save hours of debugging. A well-configured system paves the way for leveraging GPU power seamlessly in demanding applications, making your workflows more efficient and hassle-free. 🚀

Following up from my comment on a previous post. Just wanted to share my experience with TTC/short luteal phase/ progesterone. 
Started TTC in 2014 casually, then started more seriously around 2015 when nothing seemed to be happening. Had two early losses in 2016 at 5 weeks and 7 weeks. 
From charting, I noticed my luteal phase was shorter than it should be. Got progesterone from my OB that I would take from 3DPO until either my cycle started or until second trimester of pregnancy. I carried two pregnancies successfully on this regimen in 2017-18 and 2019-20. 
I just started charting again. I have a Mirena IUD I’m getting removed in February and will do the progesterone regimen again. Curious if anyone else has had experiences with prior to IUD having short luteal phase or any fertility issues, what it was like after your IUD was out…?

Pictures of my charts to show initially my short luteal phase averaging about 9 days. Then TTC1 with progesterone and TTC2 with progesterone. On the med my LP lengthened to an average of about 11 days. 

TLDR: history of two early losses, found out I had short luteal phase, got pregnant by third cycle of progesterone twice. About to get IUD out in February and try again. ",5,1733935327.0,TFABChartStalkers,4,1.0,False

I heard this story during my memorable trip to the Holy Mountain in December of 2018. I was then able to venerate two Greek saints who were of great importance to me. I had this feeling as if they took me by hand and walked me all the way from Athens to Mount Athos, helping me reach my destinations, always sending people I needed the most at that particular moment. My visit to St. Nectarios of Aegina at the beginning of my journey was accompanied by a few minor and unremarkable miracles and acts of blessed help. It was quite late when I arrived on the island, so public transportation had stopped running. When I managed to finally get to the monastery by hitching rides and walking, the gates were already closed. I was able to find a wicket gate left open at the back of the monastery and I stepped inside the backyard, when a monastery worker spotted me there through the fence. Having learned that I was a pilgrim from Russia, he called a nun who settled me in a nice and empty pilgrim house for the night and even brought a packed meal to eat. Next morning, I went to liturgy and venerated the relics of St. Nectarios, thanking him for not leaving me without shelter late in the evening in an unknown place.

>None of them have seen St. Nectarios alive, but each of them had a relative who personally knew the saint

After Liturgy, we had coffee with local Greeks in the monastery guesthouse, a really touching and family-style experience. They spoke about St. Nectarios as if they spent all their lives near him. None of them, of course, saw him alive, but each and every one of them had a relative who knew the saint in person. So, they’d reminisce about their loved ones—someone had a father, another an uncle or a relative who labored in the monastery during the life of the saint or who simply visited the monastery to see him. Among those family members, the name of St. Nectarios was pronounced in such a way as if he were one of them—and also someone truly special and dear to them, who infused their lives with prayer, blessing, and protection. Having learned that I was traveling to Mount Athos, they gave me prayer lists filled with the dear names of their loved ones who had passed away long ago—fathers and mothers, uncles and cousins, whom they asked to be remembered in prayer on Mt. Athos, along with the still living members of their families. It was as if I recieved a pocketful of fragments of life from several generations on Aegina, near St. Nectarios, a fruit of his prayers that I was about to deliver and share with Athos.

I planned to visit St. John the Russian on Euboea and then go up north along the eastern coast of Greece towards Macedonia. But, this being said and as it typically happens, I had only a limited amount of time and barely enough money. I had at best around a hundred euros, and I had to arrive to the Holy Mountain on Saturday morning in order to make it to the cell and serve a Liturgy there on Sunday. It meant I had to make use of a method so well-tried and so well-tested from youth called hitchhiking—because waiting for all those sloth-like buses that lazily crawled out of the bus stations once every two hours was a sure guarantee that I would never make it anywhere on time. Therefore, once I reached Chalcis, I walked to the outskirts to catch a ride while praying to St. John the Russian to send someone to help me out. It was getting darker and my adventure began to look more and more risky. Then, some time later, a well-worn dark green pickup truck with a folding ladder in its bed drove out of a side lane not far from me. It slowed down and the people inside the truck waved me in.

Georgios and Ioannis, a father-son duo, were heading home after just finishing their work as builders somewhere in the area. Having learned that I was planning to go to St. John the Russian, they said that they can only take me to their home and from there I would have to travel by myself. It was December and darkness descended early, so, when we drove up to their house, twilight died into dark. After talking it over, they stepped inside and I was told to wait for them inside the truck. When they soon returned, they said their family was aware of their plans and they were ready to take me to St. John. It was getting dark fast and the narrow winding road straggled among the hills overgrown with thick pine groves—but before we reached Prokopi, we still had to travel across the large island stretched along the coast of the Peloponnese. During our ride, they told me that their ancestors were among those who, according to a 1920 treaty, came here from Proconnesus in Turkey. Like their most sacred treasure, they carried with them the holy relics of their saint and intercessor John the Russian. Ioannis, whose birth was a miracle attributed to prayers to this saint, was named after him. That’s why the church in Prokopi was like a native home to them and they’d come there at every opportunity, as if paying a visit to their beloved family member. When they venerated the reliquary with the relics, they did so with such reverence and without any fuss, as if they were hugging a living person. It all looked as if Ioannis simply really wanted to see his godfather and they finally met after a brief time apart.

Georgios and Ioannis left, but I was unable to walk away from the relics of St. John the Russian, despite having already read the akathist a long time before and venerating his relics more than once. I was simply standing there for about two hours, and I was feeling so warm inside; I so wanted to stay right there, and nowhere else. I watched other people coming to pray to the saint, who also venerated his relics and asked of him some favor. Some were old, others middle-aged, some with children. Schoolchildren, who had just begun their Christmas break, filled the church as entire classes—the following morning they were to attend a special Liturgy for children, when almost all of them were to partake of the Holy Mysteries. Then there came some local punks, looking totally unbothered about their appearance, no one inside the church actually minding their presence, and they venerated the tomb of the saint just as habitually and devoutly as everyone else. This sight aroused a particularly heartwarming feeling—because for the saint, all of these people were like his family, his kin. He knew their grandmothers and grandfathers in their youth, and then many others among their remote ancestors who grew up before his eyes and with his prayers. This alliance of the people and the saint made me feel happy for all of them, who are so fortunate to live under his grace-filled protection.

Then came a priest who made arrangements for me to stay in a comfortable pilgrim house right across the road from the church. It was late and I was hungry, so I went to find something to eat. It is actually a problem for small Greek towns lying some distance away from tourist routes. They have an abundance of coffee houses, where the locals while away the evenings sipping coffee and homemade, milky white, cloudy anise ouzo mixed with water and eating bits of tiny cakes and Turkish delights. They lazily argue with one another, share news and gossip, watch soccer on some prehistoric TV, or listen to traditional music in those family-owned taverns that see the same visitors year in, year out. However, if you need to eat, especially if you are there during a Nativity fast, you can’t count on having anything else but coffee, ouzo, soccer and Turkish delights. I had to pop into one of those bakeries, or “artopoio,” that was still opened. Its owner, an elderly Greek woman, was excited to see me, a Russian “pateras,” and called for her Russian daughter-in-law. Katya, a beauty from Siberia who married a Greek and made him a father of four sons, was also extremely happy to see a compatriot and asked me to stop by again before my departure. I did as she requested and she gave me a whole bunch of homemade breads and cookies, as well as prayer lists and money to commemorate her family on the Holy Mountain. And that’s how I looked for the rest of my trip—bedecked with all sorts of bags, like a petty shuttle trader from notorious late 1990s in Russia.

>The saints continued to take me by the hand as if I were a child, on my way to Mt. Athos

At this point, my readers must have already asked a legitimate question: What am I talking about here? Where is that German mentioned at the title, and his wondrous story? Well, there is neither a mistake nor coincidence that I bring out all those kind-hearted Greek people that the Lord has sent on my way through the intercession of saints so intimately connected with them throughout their whole lives. As if I were a child, the saints continued to take me by the hand on my trip to Mt. Athos. Again and again, they’d send me someone who would gladly and freely pick up a strange hitchhiker from the edge of the road and drive him for some distance in their car. That’s how I ended up in Larissa, and once I came to the city’s bypass road, even before I raised my hand, a car that just whizzed by me suddenly backed up and its door was cordially swung open to let me in.

Inside were a married couple, George and Joanna, and their children—Silouana, named in honor of our venerable Athonite saint, and Michael. They were driving to Thessaloniki to spend the Christmas holidays together. “Just think of it!” George wondered. “We always take another road, a faster one, but today for some reason we decided to take this one. It must be because we had to meet you!” These kind-hearted and deeply religious people took care of me and we drove right up to the bus station in Thessaloniki, where I managed to catch the last bus traveling to Ouranoupolis. Thanks to them, I was able to reach the Holy Mountain with all of those piles of bread offerings and serve a Sunday Liturgy in the kaliva where I was expected to arrive.

On the way from Larissa to Thessaloniki, my friendly fellow travelers and I talked about all kinds of things. Among other things, it turned out that George and Joanna live in London where he works in a banking sector, and that they came here to visit his parents and children from his first marriage. He said that he is German on his paternal side, but he always felt more like Greek—his mother’s native tongue and her faith were closer to him, even if German has always been his second native language. His father, also a very kind man, also loved Greece, and would eagerly visit the country, but he preferred to reside in Germany. However, a few years ago he was diagnosed with a devastating illness—doctors discovered a massive tumor in his brain. He had complex surgeries, underwent all the necessary treatment and then started a lengthy recovery period. As it turned out, after all those interventions in the brain area, he suffered a loss of self, and in so many ways, George’s father practically became like a child again. He did remember his family, his wife and the son, but he had to once again learn to be himself. He also had to learn how to speak again, to get immersed in culture and society, and to become a new person. His family, who took him to Greece to spend this recovery period and make it more convenient to care for him, did everything they could to help him recover. But, under these circumstances, he returned to a meaningful life not as a German, but a Greek, because his family couldn’t make him someone they weren’t themselves. Thus, in his rather advanced years, George’s father was wondrously reborn as another person, starting life practically with a clean slate.

>“We don’t just believe in saints—we live next to them.” The saints are the Greeks’ most precious treasure

So, despite all the hardships and sufferings he and his family had to endure during his illness, it seems as if the Lord bestowed upon him the greatest and priceless gift. It’s true that Greece may be inferior to Germany in certain things. It may have never had a “miracle economy” or it isn’t as well developed in terms of economy and the quality of life, just as it can’t boast of having the universally recognized brands such as Mercedes or BMW, or even Volkswagen. Still, with all due respect to the German people and other nations, the Greeks possess something far more precious; something that has been long dead in other countries. As they themselves express it: “We don’t just believe in saints—we live next to them.” The saints are the most precious treasure they possess. They are the fruit of the two millennia of Christian history of this land, its spiritual “capital.” Their country is still nurtured by that grace-filled “interest” acquired from that wealth. It is the blessed fragrance that fills the air in this country, transforms the hearts and illuminates the people’s faces. It is possible that not everything is perfect and beautiful in Greece, or with the Greeks, and there are things that one would want to change or fix there. But all of that will ultimately belong to the past, while the life next to the saints will last forever. And this is the priceless gift this German man received by becoming a Greek.

But I also think: Doesn’t this also happen to all of us, albeit minus the agonizing lobotomy and a poisonous chokehold of chemotherapy sessions? Because we also undergo the process of gradual replacement of one identity with another. Because of this change, we become a part of a new nation that has neither foreign languages nor borders. With the surgery that skillfully surpasses anything known to the mind of man, the Lord gradually removes from us the tumors of abomination and the metastases of filth, heals the glaucoma of ignorance and impassable stupidity, thus making us who we can and should become—citizens of the Heavenly City, where the only passport necessary is our participation in holiness. Basically, this is what will be our shared nationality in a place where it no longer matters whether you are born into this world as a Hellene or a Scythe. What matters is our rebirth as “new man” in Christ.

One of the event's dedicated volunteers, Rick Goebel, spends each Wednesday greeting students along Virginia Street, inviting them to stop by for a meal.  
  
“Different groups make the lunch each week, but the Knights help with most of it,"" says Goebel. “Today, the volunteers are from Immaculate Conception Church, and each week, other groups within the diocese contribute food to help.”  
  
A Reno native, Goebel attended Bishop Manogue High School and later graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno. As an alum who attended Our Lady of Wisdom Church during his college years, he felt a personal connection when he was asked to volunteer.  
  
Seeing students gather each week brings Goebel a sense of purpose. “It’s motivational for me to see more and more people come, to witness the organic growth and the good things that are happening here. It’s rewarding to see it grow every week,” he says.  
  
Leo Carew III, the state treasurer for the Knights of Columbus for Nevada, has been with the organization for eight years.  Carew emphasizes the organization’s commitment to fostering a spirit of service among young people. “We are trying to give back to the students to let them know it is okay to serve, to say yes in volunteer work,” he says. By encouraging students to participate in these community lunches, Carew hopes to inspire them to embrace volunteerism and the positive impact it can have on others.  
  
Apart from the free lunches each Wednesday, the Newman Center also offers free coffee Monday-Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., as well as a waffle bar each Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.

---------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen water has gained popularity as a potential health booster, attracting attention for its various health benefits, particularly in relation to inflammation. Inflammation is a natural response of the body to harmful stimuli, but chronic inflammation can lead to serious health issues such as arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. Understanding how hydrogen water might play a role in reducing inflammation can be insightful for anyone looking to enhance their well-being.

Hydrogen water, which is simply water infused with molecular hydrogen (H2), is believed to possess antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are essential because they help neutralize free radicals, unstable molecules that can cause oxidative stress and contribute to inflammation. By drinking hydrogen water, you could potentially reduce oxidative stress and, consequently, its inflammatory response.

Moreover, hydrogen water may help in several ways:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/

### The Role of Inflammation in the Body

Inflammation serves a critical role in your immune system. When your body detects something harmful, like pathogens or damaged cells, it initiates an inflammatory response. This process involves the release of various substances, including hormones and white blood cells, to fight off the threat. However, when inflammation persists beyond its necessary duration, it can become problematic.

### Types of Inflammation

There are two main types of inflammation: acute and chronic.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Acute Inflammation:** This is a short-term response, usually following an injury or infection. Symptoms may include redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which generally resolve as the healing process completes.
- **Chronic Inflammation:** This type lasts for months or even years. It can arise from unresolved infections, autoimmune diseases, or prolonged exposure to irritants. Chronic inflammation is linked to serious health conditions, making it crucial to manage.

### How Chronic Inflammation Affects Health

Chronic inflammation has been implicated in numerous health issues, including:

- **Heart Disease:** Inflammation plays a significant role in heart disease. It can lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks.
- **Diabetes:** Insulin resistance, a key factor in type 2 diabetes, is often driven by inflammatory processes. Managing inflammation might help improve insulin sensitivity.
- **Arthritis:** Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis are characterized by inflammation. This leads to pain and stiffness in joints, severely affecting mobility.
- **Cancer:** Chronic inflammation may promote the growth of tumors and the proliferation of cancer cells. It's crucial to understand this link for prevention strategies.
- **Neurodegenerative Disorders:** Diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are associated with ongoing inflammation in the brain, contributing to cognitive decline.

### Signs of Inflammation

Recognizing signs of inflammation can help you take proactive steps to manage it. Common symptoms include:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/

The Science Behind Hydrogen Water and Its Antioxidant Properties
----------------------------------------------------------------

Hydrogen water is gaining much attention in the health community, largely due to its potential antioxidant properties. This innovative drink is simply water infused with hydrogen gas. But what does this mean for your health, particularly regarding inflammation? Let’s delve into the science behind hydrogen water and explore how it might be beneficial for inflammation.

The human body naturally produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a byproduct of metabolism. These ROS, while essential at controlled levels, can lead to oxidative stress when they accumulate excessively. Oxidative stress is linked to various health issues, including chronic inflammation. This is where the benefits of hydrogen water come into play, as studies suggest that hydrogen may help mitigate oxidative stress.

While hydrogen water shows potential benefits for inflammation and overall health, it’s essential to understand its limitations. It is not a miracle cure but can be a complementary part of a healthy lifestyle. Any significant health concern should always be discussed with a healthcare professional.

The combination of these practices can optimize the body’s functionality and enhance the positive effects hydrogen water may offer.

Hydrogen water represents an exciting development in the realm of health and wellness. While more research is necessary to fully understand its benefits and mechanisms, the existing studies provide a compelling case for its inclusion in anti-inflammatory strategies.

### Start Your Day Right

Kick off your mornings by hydrating with hydrogen water. Instead of your usual coffee or tea, try drinking a glass of hydrogen water first thing. This can help rehydrate your body after a night’s sleep and may provide an energy boost. You can easily prepare hydrogen water using a hydrogen water generator or by purchasing pre-made bottled options.

### Stay Hydrated During Workouts

Consider using hydrogen water during your exercise sessions. It’s a great idea to sip on hydrogen water before, during, and after your workouts. Many athletes believe that hydrogen water can reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, helping to boost their performance. Replace regular water with hydrogen water in your water bottle to explore its benefits while you work out.

### Flavor It Up

If you find plain hydrogen water a bit too bland, you can add a splash of flavor. Here are some ideas:

- Add fresh slices of lemon, lime, or cucumber for a refreshing twist.
- Mix in berries like strawberries or raspberries for a hint of sweetness.
- Infuse with herbs such as mint or basil for an aromatic experience.

These natural flavors not only boost the taste but can also offer additional health benefits.

### Use it in Cooking

Another convenient way to incorporate hydrogen water is by using it in your cooking. You can replace regular water with hydrogen water in dishes that require boiling or steaming. This includes pasta, rice, or soups. Some believe cooking with hydrogen water may enhance the nutritional quality of the food, though research on this is ongoing.

### Integrate into Your Daily Supplements

If you take dietary supplements, consider combining them with hydrogen water. Drinking hydrogen water with your vitamins or probiotics can support absorption, giving your body an extra boost. Avoid taking supplements with beverages that can inhibit absorption, such as caffeinated drinks.

To his surprise, within a month, he experienced a notable decrease in inflammation and swelling. He could return to activities he loved, like gardening and playing with his grandchildren, something he had almost given up.

For Mary, a busy professional mother dealing with the stress of everyday life, fatigue and inflammation were constant companions. She often felt overwhelmed and noticed that high-stress levels aggravated her already existing inflammation. After a friend recommended hydrogen water, Mary decided to take a leap of faith. She began drinking hydrogen water every morning, and to her delight, she noticed improved energy levels and reduced inflammation. Mary's daily routine became easier, and she felt rejuvenated to tackle her day-to-day tasks.

1hbxjqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hbxjqo/abdominal_painmalaisesevere_health_anxiety/,Abdominal pain/malaise/severe health anxiety ,"Hi, everyone. Thank you in advance for your time in reading my post. I am 28F and weigh a little less than 170lb. I have lost approximately 60lb since May of this year - I went through a divorce and was in a high stress environment to where I didn’t eat as much as I used to. I used to eat take-out and fast food daily in graduate school and now I don’t do that anymore. I am taking birth control (daily pill), simvastatin (10mg nightly), and Prozac (30mg daily; 15mg AM and 15mg PM). I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. I am not formally diagnosed with this, but I’m pretty sure I have health anxiety/OCD. 

I had some pretty severe (but temporary) abdominal pain on Saturday (11/16) afternoon that passed after thirty minutes. I was forcing myself to throw up to feel better - nothing abnormal about the vomit other than the coffee I had drank that morning. The night before, I had fajitas (guacamole, rice, and beans) from a Mexican restaurant and a frozen strawberry daiquiri. I rarely consume alcohol and do not do drugs. The same thing happened on Sunday as I was driving to the park - I had to turn around to go home. I went to the urgent care that week, and they prescribed me with antacids. They had me pee in a cup to check for pregnancy, and I noticed my pee was cloudy, so I asked them to do a urine culture, too. It came back positive and they diagnosed me with a UTI (E. coli and E. faecalis). They prescribed me ciprofloxacin for a week. They were surprised because my symptoms “didn’t align with a UTI.”  I initially went to the urgent care to see if they could check me for appendicitis (they did, and no appendicitis). Ever since then, I have been going down a huge rabbit hole of health anxiety. Like, I am on my phone all day googling things and can barely eat. I am not hydrating well either. It’s not that I can’t keep it down, it’s just that the anxiety is so debilitating and I cannot focus on anything else. I went to another urgent care to get blood work done (because I later found out that the first urgent care isn’t covered under my insurance), and I requested for a lipid panel. My bloodwork came back fine, but my cholesterol was 236 (LDL 148), and ALT 41. They said liver enzyme isn’t a concern but they want to lower my cholesterol, so they put me on simvastatin (10mg) for a month. High cholesterol does run in my family. I have recently gone through a divorce and have lost 60 pounds. My diet has also changed drastically - I used to eat so much fast food and take out and now I don’t even do that.

Ever since my high cholesterol diagnosis, I have truly gone down even worse rabbit holes. My entire day is dedicated to researching, and I am so exhausted. I have such an overwhelming feeling of tiredness and malaise. I dread getting out of the bed to do house chores and to take a shower or even to exercise. Last night, I woke myself up to a panic attack. I am in this constant back and forth of whether or not it’s my anxiety or if I’m truly sick.

To make matters worse, my throat got sore, so I went back to the second urgent care that did my bloodwork, and tested positive for the flu. I asked them to elaborate on my bloodwork and they reassured me that there’s nothing wrong with my liver or gall bladder. She also mentioned that my cholesterol might have been significantly higher because I did NOT fast before the blood was collected. I was in tears from debilitating anxiety to where she had to hug me for a few minutes before letting me go. She prescribed me Prozac (30mg daily) to see if it helps. I have taken Prozac before and am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression (diagnosed several years ago). 

I am so deathly afraid of something being truly wrong with me. I’m fortunate to have never had any surgeries (aside from my wisdom teeth that I had taken out awake). I don’t have my parents to lean on (my mom and I do not speak and my dad passed away). I dread the thought of being asked to go for imaging because the anxiety is telling me that something is so wrong with me and I just don’t want to know.

For some background, I (28F) live in a small town with not much going on. I haven't found a lot of friends here, and there aren't many options to meet new people. I have been job hunting so that I can relocate to one of the cities in the surrounding area. For now, I'm putting myself out there and going to events in these cities to see if I can find my people and make more friends.

The other night, I went to a show and a little bit into it, this guy near me approached me. He complimented my energy, kept checking in with me to make sure I was having a good time, we shared water/snacks and danced and talked during breaks... Admittedly I was a bit wary because I am not used to men approaching me (probably because I was usually accompanied my ex), but he was very kind to me and made sure I felt safe and comfortable. At the end of the show, we hugged and shared IGs, he even made sure I had a safe place to spend the night since he knew I was from out of town. And then we said goodbye and parted ways. I had a lot of fun with him and left feeling really interested in getting to know him.
Some time the next day I messaged him thanking him for the good times, and we sparked up a conversation. I noticed that he was a bit non-responsive (and would often leave me on read), but he always asked me follow-up questions, so I just assumed that he is busy but that he wanted to continue getting to know me. We kept chatting back and forth for a few days.
Our conversation ended a bit strangely- he asked me a good question, I responded to it/ asked him a follow up question, and then he left it on read and stopped responding.
It has been a few days of no response, but I'll be honest- I was really interested in our conversation and getting to know this guy more. I am super bummed, and a bit confused. I didn't say anything that I think would give off any red flags, I didn't send him a novel/spam a bunch of messages, and I have been resisting the urge to say anything else...
- Is there something that I could say that would remind him of our convo?
- I have been thinking about just going for it and asking him to go grab a coffee or something, but fear that may be too forward, and I feel it would be weird to ask him on a day that I don't already have another obligation in the city- at this point I won't be there until a holiday, and then not until a couple of months from now.

We are hoping to move down closer to the Albany/Troy area as I work on the Plaza and they work at Siena. The daily commute and isolation has been rough since they occasionally have work things in the evening/ on weekends so feel like they can never get out of the apartment. Also, we thought they were going to have a ""hipper"" vibe instead of a ""We are all rich and just LOOOVVVEEE horses and SPAC."" vibe.  
So, like the title says we are looking for the perfect apartment and I am hoping for recommendations. Our Criteria: 2-3 bedroom, 2 bath, in unit washer and dryer, garage (preferably attached), outdoor space such as patio or balcony, walkable to things like a non-Dunkin coffee shop, decently safe so my partner can map out a daily morning run, and just a generally nice complex.  
I know these are a kind of complicated set of requests but we are both adults with decent jobs so any ideas regardless of price (within limits, jobs are decent but not extravagant) are welcome. We have kind of thought about the apartments on Starbuck Island because they seem the closest to fulfilling our list according to the general apartment aggregate sites. But I was wondering if anybody here had thoughts on alternatives. I looked at some apartments down in Delmar that seemed nice but my partner thought that was ""too far from things"" they want to be able to walk to local shops and such.

A bit of a random question that popped into my mind. Whenever I see the big costa coffee machines at Tesco I wonder how they work as a ""different brand"" living within Tesco.

Do Cost have their own staff that come and refill the beans/add milk/etc? Or is that a job done internally with Tesco staff?

How do they keep clean? For example, if you need to add milk, is the old milk cleaned away? Or is new milk added on top of the old milk? Do you just pour bottles of milk in? Or is there a big ""costa milk"" sachet?

Also, what's it like to work with the machine/keep on top of it? Is it a real pain in the butt or does the machine do it's job without you having to spend too much time dealing with its needs (more coffee) and problems (breakdowns?).

After a few weeks of brewing with the K Ultra I’m having trouble dialing it in. No matter what grind size, brew method or coffee, I keep getting this astringent, tannin-y, fuzzy mouthfeel with my coffees that isn’t very pleasant (as compared to Q2 - which I can tell lacked a little body compared to what K Ultra offers but I could distinctively pick out notes and consistently had a bright, juicy finish with no lingering tannin, dryness, fuzziness).

For months on the Q2 I was brewing at 69 clicks (nice), which is on the coarser side but I got really great, clean, juicy cups every time. My standard brew method was 3x weight of coffee @ 1:00 bloom and then two equal pours to target volume. So 16 grams coffee - 50 gram bloom for 1:00, pour to 250, wait 15 seconds, pour to 256. TBT 3:00-3:30. Agitation varied on beans used ( e.g. less w Ethiopian / more w Colombian)

Switch to the K Ultra - started at 1.0.0 which according to honestbrewguide’s coffee grind size chart is close to the 69 clicks on Q2. Same brew recipe and got very dry, fuzzy, back of mouth tannin-y cups. I can tell the K Ultra is giving that bigger body and sweetness like it should (acidity is hit or miss), but it all fell off very quickly and replaced with that dry feeling. Overall, just a bit of a disjointed clunky profile. 

I have played around with agitation, no agitation, single pour, multiple pours, 0:30 bloom, 2:00 bloom and continue getting this dryness in my cups. I tried changing grind size from 6.5 to 8.5 to 9.0 and all the same tweaks, one variable at a time and I keep getting this super dry cup. 

I am brewing September’s Mullugeta Muntasha and Bekele Yutute with TWW light roast profile 1/2 strength at 94 Celsius. 

I understand all coffee has some bitter, dry notes to it, but this isn’t that. 

Any ideas on what’s going on or what to change? Thanks for any insight! ",1,1733934231.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I’m married now and my wife bought a Breville Bambino Plus and a Baratza Encore ESP grinder. For some reason I can’t get it to pull correctly, and I’m wondering how much of my big-expensive-machine knowledge is probably not translatable to this mini set up.

I’m doing the following:

* grinding fresh beans on setting 20
* using 16 grams of ground coffee
* tamp twice with \~30lbs of pressure; tried again tamping twice with maybe < 5lbs of pressure if that
* using single wall double shot filter

The shots are barely pulling (dripping out of the portofilter, no creme, low final volume). Any advice from other current or ex-baristas on how I am supposed to approach this home set up?",0,1733934179.0,espresso,9,0.5,False

Apologies for this just being a list of names but I wanted folks to get their flair credit in a timely manner. 

Luckily, he was home for the day of his birthday and we took off to spend it relaxing at a Korean spa. That morning, as we drank our coffee (me, tea), he opened his cards and enjoyed every bit of them! Without further ado, thank you to these kind friends for taking the time to celebrate his birthday this year:

1hbx5eg,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1hbx5eg/accountability_checkin_month_2/,Accountability Check-In: Month 2,"Hello everyone, I'm a little early on this but here goes.

Stats: F Age: 30s SW: 202, CW: 185, GW: 150

Month 2 loss: 4 pounds

Month 2: Boy was this month hard. I had a 2+ week stall that almost broke my motivation. Between that, a 2 week long viral illness and Thanksgiving shenanigans, I'm surprised I lost anything at all. You think being sick would make this easier, but my body tends to rebel illness and eat even more to try to make myself feel better. That being said there were A LOT of dirty fasting days where I had a hot coffee with cream to get through the mornings. Before I got sick, I got into a huge baking kick and was cooking and baking some delicious (and REALLY high calorie) meals/desserts which I think caused the stall as well.

Exercise: I started walking around the park/neighborhood while it was still in the 50s. Once it hit the 30s-40s for the second half of the month, I didn't walk much. I did buy a walking pad so I'm going to try to focus on getting in a mile or so every night.

Changes: No one has really noticed anything other than me. I can officially fit into my size 10 jeans though! I started at a tight 16 and now the 16s are annoyingly falling off of me. Everything feels a little looser which is nice. I avoided most pictures at my heaviest so I'm not sure if I even have a picture to make as a ""before"".  I think once I hit the 25 pound loss, I'll try to do a progress pic.

Goals for next month: More movement and better calorie counting. I stalled at 188 for 2 weeks due to poor meal planning. My goal is to have healthier meals when I break my fast and lay off my good ol' southern cooking.

1hbx3qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1hbx3qd/where_did_i_go_wrong/,Where did I go wrong? ,"26 F was talking to 29M via a arranged marriage setting via family contacts…everything was going fine for 3 months…coffee dates twice a week…walk in parks and late night texts…suddenly after 3 months he started texting less frequently…wanted to hang out less..meanwhile at home i had already told that i like this guy and am willing to proceed forward

When one night I confronted him he told me he already has a girlfriend since last year which was going downhill for him since a few months but now he wants to go back and fix things with her because he’s not someone who leaves partner at petty issues that they had…i was devastated more so because i had to tell my parents about this matter and also because all the time spent made me fall for him deeply…I had sleepless nights…cried whenever I was in front of a mirror

I cannot figure out if it was my mistake he lost feelings for me after 3 months…was I less professionally qualified than her or less prettier than her..because he told me he didn’t tell me in the beginning because he liked me and if he would have I wouldn’t have spent time with him.

Again he tells me he’ll end things up but he’s not sure when and also that he still likes me 

What should i do..should i wait for him to breakup ? 
And where did i go wrong from a guys perspective I really wanna know 
Also I shared a personal trauma with him could it be the reason he started to find me less attractive?

Also he told me i can get any guy i want including him but for him the timings were not right. It’s been months and i still cry myself to sleep seeking answers 

I asked him in beginning about his relationship history..he said there’s nothing to worry about.
