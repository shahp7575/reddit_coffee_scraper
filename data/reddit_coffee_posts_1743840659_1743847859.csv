My stock of medium-roast and light-roast coffee beans is gradually getting over. I usually order from BlueTokai (through subscription). At present, there is no light-roast on the website and the customer-service mentioned they do not know when a light-roast variant will come. 

I checked Subko, KC Roasters, Tata, Araku. Black-Baza has Potter Wasp or Jumping-Ant. (The other option is Siolim; but its 920 (for 200 grams) + shipping.)

So, I am bit surprised about the low availability of light-roast! (BlueTokai, which used to have at least two light roast variant, has been having only Hidden-Falls from the last few months. That and MSP Microlot, which I was happy to snatch, are no more available.

1js05m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1js05m2/my_date_called_me_low_class_to_a_message_to_his/,My date called me “low class” to a message to his friend,"I’ve posted this on other channels but thought this also deserved a place here. For context, I’m British and he’s American.

This week was my Birthday - after a whole day celebrating, I was waiting at a bus stop to go home when a guy approached me. I was quite impressed by his confidence so I gave him the time of day. Initially, I thought he was attractive, softly spoken, somewhat interesting and confident. I had a wonderful Birthday so it was just a bonus that a hot guy approached me! I was in a particularly giddy mood as I can’t believe I made it to 33 (I have health issues so it’s just a bonus I am in relatively good health this decade so far). We made plans to meet up the next day as he was flying back to the States.

On our date, he seemed kind, funny, interesting. We just went for a coffee in a park and chatted for hours. I thought we had a great connection - so much so, he even moved his flight to next week so he could spend more with me which I was touched by. 

When he was trying to amend his flight, a conversation with a friend of his popped up and I could see a photo of me that he must have found online. I asked him what he’d said to his friend but he suddenly got really shy and didn’t want to share it, citing that it was embarrassing. I thought he said something complimentary. How wrong I was. After drinks at a hotel bar, he asked me to go for dinner. I declined initially but I thought “OK since he’s not going to be in the country for longer”. At dinner, I pressed him on what he told his friend the night we met.

Cue my shock when I read that he’d said to his friend that apparently I seemed “slightly low class but intellectual”.

I was obviously so shocked and winded. He said that on my BIRTHDAY! The night we met. He also said I “had a huge ass”. His friends arrived that same minute. I confronted him in front of his friend and his friend’s girlfriend as they arrived at our table who looked as shocked as I felt. I left immediately. 

Now an in the wrong? I don’t think I am. I think I stood up / showed up for myself and have enforced boundaries going forward that I’d prefer if I could cut communication. We had plans to meet today but tbh I don’t think I want someone like that in my life. I don’t want an unkind, classist partner not now and not ever. I also got diagnosed with a life-limiting disability so I do want someone who is empathetic, kind, patient and won’t mock me for being “low class”.  It also doesn’t help that my contract ended last month so he thinks even less of me that I don’t have a job right now.

Just to confirm, I wasn’t insulting to waiters / wait staff, I didn’t spit, I didn’t get violently drunk (I didn’t even drink!). I just had a matcha latte in a park with him, non-alc drinks at a hotel bar and was heading to dinner to meet his friends. Not sure what’s so low class about that? Not that I need to defend myself but I went to two excellent universities, I read books, am interested in other cultures/cuisines, go to art galleries and exhibitions and treat people as kindly as I can (if they’re a cleaner or a CEO). 

He then spent the entire evening trying to rationalise what he said over WhatsApp, citing that the meaning “low class” differs in the UK to the USA. But does it? Being unkind and lacking respect is the same the world over. He did apologise but IMO I would have had more respect for him if he’d actually said “I said something hurtful and judged you without getting to know you and I don’t stand by that”.

I should mention I’m a woman of colour and he’s white but not sure how much that plays a role in this.

TLDR: A guy approached me and asked me out, went on a date with him and later discovered that he’d messaged his friend calling me “low class”. He then tried to rationalise it citing that “low class” means something complimentary in the States!! I walked out of dinner with his friends and blocked him ",0,1743847604.0,povertyfinance,0,0.5,False

So I would like to share an incident which traumatized me a lot.I was going to my work morning. Generally I used to use the restroom as soon as I go since I have weak bladder capacity.And even before I leave I will make sure to use inorder to avoid discomfort.But on that day I drank some kinda coffee after my work.Then I went to my bus stop.Here starts the real trouble...
When I was waiting for my bus the urge to urinate hit me.I thought like to use in near by restroom of a small bakery cum tea stall.But the bus is already yet to come and I was shy to use restroom in bakery.So I managed to control till my home.THIS WAS THE BIGGEST BLUNDER I DID.When the bus came,I entered and was standing.The road bumps and huge crowd humiliated my urge so hard,like tears were coming from my eyes.I was out of control because it isn't a bus taken for one district to another,so sure there will not be any stops for restrooms.Then finally by god's grace I got a seat to sit.But though it wasn't peaceful because I wasn't even able to distract myself and eventually I was shivering in very urge.Then finally I came to my apartment.And my house was at 5th floor.There will be no issues because we have  elevators.But during that time, like when I was waiting for my elevator,and the elevator going to my floor..was like many hours since I controlled my urine for 1 hour.Then I entered my house very urgently and entered the restroom.Literally I was leaking,but somehow managed to use the restroom..while urinating I involuntarily started to cry in relief and happiness.
This is one of my most embarrassing moment of my life since I looked so sick and weird,cause of that many people were asking me whether I was ok or not,like they already came to know I wanna use the restroom and I am in urge to urinate
If you have read the story properly I wouldn't have mentioned my gender.Reason is simple everyone who works for their family will surely face this situation.Even I feel embarrassing to talk about this but this happened so recently and the pain I faced was really awful.. inorder to express my emotions I'd post this..many may feel weird to read this.But this is reality.

How do believers continue to view these organizations as meaningful and valid in light of these changes?,"This is a genuine question, not an attempt to dunk.  My family is not religious so l can struggle to understand the perspective of those who do have strong faith. I did go to a religious (Christian) school.

I've come across many examples, in modern day and in history, where religious organizations have changed their stances on issues based on public opinion or other external factors. I understand people can have different interpretations of religious texts - but I struggle to understand how the entire rules of a religious organization can be changed and that organization still be accepted as valid. I'll put a couple examples of what I'm talking about below in case this doesn't make sense.

Personal Experience: I'm Australian. Gay marriage became legal here in late 2017, following about a year of massive public debate and a national survey to measure levels of public support. We had weekly Chapel services at my school and at one of them, around the time it became legal, the Chaplain very seriously told us that the top ministers of the church had been debating the issue and had decided that ministers were allowed to perform same-sex marriages if they wanted to. It seemed a little odd to me that decisions about what is allowed within faith/religion could be informed by social consensus. Like, did God change his mind? We're meant to follow what HE thinks, he doesn't follow what WE think. If religions can change based on society changing, how can we trust we are every really following the word of God? If the church just did an oopsie with its original stance, how can we trust they are correct now?

Contemporary example: The Mormon church, which has flip-flopped on a lot of its views to help its image. Polygamy was a key element in the faith for ages - until the mainstream church distanced itself from it following pressure from the government. It used to teach that dark skin was a curse from God and people of colour weren't allowed to be priests - then allowed priesthood because of public pressure during the civil rights movement. They have also softened their views on things like drinking coffee, wearing governments, etc; seemingly to be more palatable to people outside the church. How can the church be accepted as valid and true when they clearly change the rules based on what benefits them? How does it make sense that they've disavowed the teachings of their founder?",2,1743846845.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,1.0,False

1jrztnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1jrztnl/exploited_kasambahay/,Exploited Kasambahay,"We currently have a kasambahay na nagtrabaho sa amin at shinare niya yung experiences niya sa previous employer.

She worked for her employer for 8 months. 2 silang pumasok (siya & pinsan niya). When they applied 8,000 yung agreed salary. Pagdating nila sa workplace, sabi ng employer kung pwede ba 7,000 nalang yung sweldo at since 2 sila, hati sila so 3,500 each PER MONTH. Pumayag daw sila since they were desperate for money. 


They were made to work everyday na walang day off. Aside from this, di sila bigyan ng breakfast food or kahit coffee until lumabas sa kwarto yung amo - mga 10 am na daw. Late na din silang kumain ng lunch, minsan mga 2 pm. Wala silang cooking area na magamit kaya they wait for leftovers. Di rin silang pwede lumabas para makabili ng food kasi may guard. They also had poor living conditions. She said that where they sleep was so so small they both could barely fit so they had to take turns sleeping at night. 

Nung tinanong ko siya bakit di sila umalis, sabi niya ininform niya yung female employer a few times pero minsan, she pretends not to hear o sasabihan sila na di pumayag si sir. Early this year, yung pinsan niya started getting stomach problems (baka siguro sa poor eating habits nila sa workplace) so binigyan siya ng 8 different kids of meds. Her cousin fainted because of this (di doctor yung amo) so nag decide na sila dapat na talaga sila magresign. Pumayag na daw yung amo pero they did not get their last pay. 

Naawa ako sa kanya kasi mabait talaga siya and napakainnocente. She is a scholar ng isang university and taking up education. She is studying online at night. I told her that they should have left sooner at sabi pa niya na naawa siya sa amo kasi need daw nila ng helper. Siya pa naawa 🥺

Some people really are evil and inhumane. Please treat your kasambahays with kindness and respect. They are people too 🥺",1,1743846150.0,OffMyChestPH,3,1.0,False

1jrzsq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1jrzsq7/how_to_read_the_divorce_prescription_novel/,"How to read ""The Divorce Prescription"" Novel","Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much… Sobs…""

Attached was a photo—no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

…

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now—a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

…

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam—the man she had always loved—she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself—the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but…

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before—not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

…

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""…Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing—no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

…

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover—hair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

…

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin—the heir to the Goodwin family—along with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you… Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three… eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time…

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is… Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn… Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

…

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer—mine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.

At this moment, Benjamin rushed over. ""Carly, she's your sister. She's Celine!""

Carly froze in disbelief. ""You're… Celine?""

Celine knew Carly had always looked down on her.

As children, Carly had bested her at every turn. She had always been outstanding. Later, she even dated Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family.

Raised in a life of luxury and affection, Carly became proud and untouchable.

Benjamin was once again stunned by Celine's exquisite beauty. He murmured, ""I didn't expect Celine to look this stunning.""

Carly's childhood memories of Celine were vague because she had never paid much attention to this unloved sister. But wasn't Celine the ugly duckling from the countryside?

Carly stepped closer. Her gaze swept over Celine with thinly veiled disdain. ""Celine, I didn't expect you to doll yourself up like me.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

Well, Carly could think whatever she wanted as long as she was happy.

Celine straightened her slender back and smiled without saying a word. The corridor lights cast a soft glow on her delicate, ethereal face. She was no longer the same little Celine from before.

Just then, Carly spoke up. ""Celine, I heard you and Adam are divorcing. Can't survive without a man, huh? Resorting to male escorts to fill the void? If I were you, I'd get a job.""

Turning to Adam, she added in a condescending tone, ""Adam, Celine has taken care of you for so long. You should at least help her find work. Maybe as a housekeeper.""

Adam's gaze flickered to Celine.

Benjamin interjected, ""Carly, every job requires qualifications. What's Celine's education level?""

Carly seemed to remember something amusing. She raised her chin with a smile and said, ""She dropped out of school when she was 16.""",1,1743846032.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I have been avoiding coffee for a few weeks now. The results took some time, and I wasn’t really sure if it was due to other things going very well. Before I had a cup of coffee last night, I was really happy, mostly focused, and able to move around well.

The coffee at first made me gradually anxious, I could feel it, and was able to shut it down for a bit, but it eventually turned into this irrational anger. I’m moody, lethargic and extremely unfocused. I’m stuck in my head, and want to lay down and not move or be around anyone. I’m feeling helpless and depressed.

It’s sort of a good thing this happened, because I can confirm that coffee impacts my mood now. It’s just one step in trying to manage this.

The panic attack occurred right after an intense cardio session and after begging my journey on caffeine withdrawal I had a few more panic attacks and anxiety attacks.

Intrusive thoughts come and go all the time. I went to the cardiologist, did a blood test and they found nothing. I'm healthy 100% and I can still hit the gym with intensity and do cardio as well. But it's like a background voice in my head telling me there's something wrong and I should look into it. My chest tightness only worsens my anxiety. Some days after workouts I feel an anxiety attack coming. I get a bit lightheaded, heart racing and my tightness comes back. After 2-3hrs I'm back to normal. HR drops to 58-61 and I feel calm and rational.

I don't google my symptoms or anything anymore because half of the symptoms I had like vertigo, muscle twitching, lightheadedness, heart palpitations, vestibular migraines and much more were due to quitting caffeine cold turkey and they were real, not some sort of imaginary scenario my mind made up.

However, it's been 47 days since I quit caffeine and I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is always active looking for danger so I fixate on every sensation I get. ",1,1743845640.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

1jrzk8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1jrzk8h/does_anyone_feel_those_more_or_less_little_things/,Does anyone feel those more or less little things?,"Hey there! I was feeling like I could need some writing. But as im a little perfectionist my standard for myself would be to give a coherent representation of everything that has to do with my state of mind and how specific events influenced me. Of course this is impossible. So instead of trying it, I decided to make a brief list of things that I recognized over time that weren't normal. Maybe some of you can relate. :)

\- Being anxious when spending money. Even if I have (more than) enough money I think more than twice whether I should buy something I don't 'actually' need. This has gotten better over the last few months but still I feel like spending money is like giving up safety. If it's for others Im more generous than for myself. I saved a lot but obviously no money can give me real safety. 

\- I absolutely hated the question 'How are you?' until I was like 21 years old. I never wanted to answer it and I cringed when I was asked. I also thought it was cringe when I ask other how they are. I used to reply with 'as usual'. 

\- I have had really bad nightmares as a child where I felt totally helpless. I used to have this dream where an alien-like creature was standing infront of my father's bedroom. It didn't do anything but I couldn't move. I recognized that I could end the dream by just screaming. Once I've had a dream where I couldn't scream. This dream was different because I wasn't facing an alien but a murderer who was threatening me with a knife. I tried to scream but my voice was muted.

\- I don't like presents. This is especially true for birthday and Christmas when its presents from my parents. I feel like I don't deserve then, can't accept them and feel anxious about not being grateful enough. Im ashamed of this because other kids don't get presents at all. On the other hand I remind even small surprises when they are genuine. My former kinda gf once bought my sweets when I passed my first exam. It still means a lot to me. In general even small gestures can win my heart completely. 

\- In my childhood and adolescence I thought kids shouldn't and couldn't have real friends. They weren't allowed to have problems either because they couldn't have 'real' problems. I still think I don't have real problems because so many people are doing way worse than me. I feel bad and ashamed about myself because I complain. 

\- I don't like bars with loud music. I never went to a club either because im anxious and because I think I don't belong there. Only the others can have this kind of life but not me. Im a philistine. 

\- I often don't get irony even though I can be really ironic and sarcastic myself. 

\- Addictions: I started smoking for no real reason. I don't trink anything though because I am very subsceptible for addictions which is - ironically - also true for gambling. 

\- I put so much effort into things without knowing what the long term goal behind it is. For example, I have a very good degree in law and at least concerning my professional life the world is open to me. Nevertheless I question whether this was the right way and what to do with it in the first place. What is it really good for? Didn't I wish for something different? When I start questioning something I tend to question everything at all because everything seems like an illusion and a distraction to me.

\- I don't have a feeling whether things have hurt me in the past. I don't know which is normal, healthy and what affected me. For instance, I rejected the idea that the divorce of my parents affected me at all. This is something for others but not for me. I didn't see it as problematic. 

\- I don't have memories before my sixth year of life. There are only few moments I remember which are all awful. 

\- I hate when others talk about how I was when I was younger, what things I said, what I did and so on. It doesn't matter whether it's positive or negative. I simply don't wanna hear it. 

\- I have phases in my life where I completely don't care about things. Whether it's a read message I need to answer, a broken light bulb or even a depressive episode, I couldn't care less to fix anything and just do nothing instead. Sometimes I think it would even be a good thing when everything collapses because then I wouldn't have to be anxious anymore. 

\- I do have certain, not necessarily wanted, kinks but honestly im only craving for a cuddling long and warm embrace. 

\- I don't get tired easily (which might also has to do with my consumption of coffee 😭) but still feel passive and like I have no energy for anything. 

\- I disciplined myself in my youth to be less outgoing and now im stuck to it. 

\- I want to somehow heal others and provide for them emotionally even though they can't receive it (I guess I couldn't either). 

So this list has become longer that intended. At some point I guess I just continued writing so that more of you can relate. 😂",1,1743844936.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False
1jrzjq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1jrzjq2/my_thoughts_after_playing_alan_wake_2_its_a_total/,My Thoughts After Playing Alan Wake 2 : It's a Total Ripoff of Resident Evil Remakes (SPOILER WARNING),"Okay, so I just finished the game, complete with all DLCs. Here is my in-depth review of the game. And I will probably gonna get a lot of strong opposition because of this, please at least read until the end, here we go. AW2 is sadly a 5/10 game, and is a blatant ripoff of RE Remakes (I will get to this at a later part). Why? lemme break it down :

First, its not scary, and I am talking about the base game. AW2 claimed to be a Horror game, but not really Horror, it is just an action shooter game, with a lil horror element sprinkled every here and there. Why is it not Horror? because of the goofy TV ads with the Ilmo guy and his brother, and goofy dancing in the Studio with FMV and all. At the start of the game, you even see two person in coffee thermos costume, goofing around, which doesnt help build the horror feel at all. Even if you are not watcing the Koskela brothers ads, their conversation can still be heard while playing. The Goofy dancing scene in the talk show studio is the biggest offender of all, they took all the horror feel away. And the Viking band members are goofy too. Some Gen Z said its a ""PsYcHoLOgiCaL HoRRor"". I mean, there is nothing horror about this game, and the two COMEDIC DLCs (""No. 1 Fan"", and ""North Star"") dont help it either. If they want a real psychological horror, they should play Silent Hill 1, which is a true Psychological horror. Silent Hill 2 has comedy too, but it was obscured and hidden only in a secret ending, not being shown over and over again. The Lake House DLC at least feels more horror. The Lake House DLC feels more serious in tones, and the oil paint monsters are absolutely terrifying, and you can only kill them with some kind of ""grenade launcher"". This DLC feels like its what the base game should have been. The downside is that there are WAY too many PAPERS to read in this DLC, and if I try to skip one letter, I'm afraid I will miss an important detail about the lore.

Secondly, the there is too few weapon choices, very limited. Weird especially for a 3rd person shooter game. Also the pre-order bonus skin for the weapon disgusts me, especially the revolver. So it has yellow-ish or gold engravings around the metal part, and white handle instead of the wood handle. Its hard to see the difference from the 3rd person perspective, the weapon is too far away and too small for players to see the difference from the regular revolver. In an FPS game, maybe you can see the skin, but not in a TPS. Also since your character hold the revolver handle with their hand, then the  revolver handle is not visible, and when not being used, its stored in its holder, which also not visible, so wtf is the point????

Thirdly, its a Resident Evil 2 & 3 Remake ripoff through and through. I made a list of the things they copied from RE Remakes, and I made a humongous list in the end :

1. Slow run ala Resident Evil Remakes. The character used to be olympic runner in AW1, now their top speed is like a relax jogging.
2. Over the Shoulder camera perspective, where the character is off the center.
3. Same Inventory system, where you can assign tools and items to the 4 directional buttons.
4. ""Save Haven"" is a ripoff of Save Room in RE games. A save place from enemies, complete with saving point (type writer in RE games, replaced with coffee thermos in AW2), and inter connected item box (its called shoebox in AW2).
5. When you try to open a locked door, the character will say : ""Its locked from the other side"" which is a very Resident Evil thing, or ""the door wouldnt budge"", which also a very RE thing. Why? it could be just ""the door is locked"" or ""its locked"". Why the need to ripped off  even the smallest thing from RE? 
6. There are combination locks that you need to unlock with numbers, which is a RE2 Remake thing, which is not present in AW1.
7. Beside padlocks with numbers, there are these padlocks that you need to unlock by repeating the pattern shown, which I believed copied the [""portable safe""] (https://www.evilresource.com/images/data/full/re2remake/portable-safe.png?3322d21d) from RE2 Remake, where you need to repeat the pattern shown to unlock the safe 
8. The game has two protagonists, each with different story and playthrough, and they are both male and female, which is not a thing in the previous games.
9. Fukin Bolt cutter, which is a staple in RE Remakes, they made a return, but in a RE Ripoff. Which is not a thing in previous games.
10. This is hilarious, I facepalmed when I saw this, searching for FUSE RODS, and to put it in a fuse box on the wall. Remember that time in RE2 game where you need to search for fuse rods to turn on the electricity in RPD? Yes, the search for fuse box to turn on electricity in the first hour of RE2 Remake made a return in this game, and multiple times too. Jesus. Why copying even the smallest thing from RE? this gameplay is not even that groundbreaking.
11. Dodging from RE3 Remake, with similar animation.
12. They copied the ""Hip Pouches"" from RE2/RE3 Remakes that add more slots to inventory, complete with similar animation too.
13. Tap the down button twice for quick turn, which is absolutely copied from Resident Evil.
14. When you are caught by the enemy, you can use side weapon like hand flare to escape, similar with that in RE Remakes, when you are caught by a zombie, you can escape by shoving grenade down the enemy's mouth, or stab it with knife. Also with similar animation too.
15. The ""running away from enemy""gameplay. Remember that time where Jill had to run away from Nemesis at the beginning of RE3 Remake? where you only need to press the directional button and sprint button? or that time Leon had to run away from Zombie Crocodile? Yep, they made a comeback, not in a RE game. It made a comeback multiple times here. 
16. The Final Boss Fight. Well, not exactly the same, but a very reminiscence of the last battle in RE3 Remake, where you need to attack and stagger the main enemy, then  while the enemy staggered, do something to prepare the ultimate killing weapon, enemy regains consciousness, attack and make it staggered again, and prepare the ultimate weapon again, rinse and repeat, until you kill the last boss with said weapon.

 I also can see that this game is so obsessed with PT Silent Hills (The playable SH teaser from 2014) LOOPING gameplay. Remember that loop you had to go through in P.T. Silent Hills Demo? yes, it made a comeback here, not in Silent Hill game sadly. Complete with the same red light too. Very original. And if you play the PT Silent Hill teaser, there is this talking bag, and he said : ""The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?"". And its clear that AW2 took an idea or two from this talking bag, and its clear from its idea of multiple verse with multiple selves in AW2. And I, as a Silent Hill fan, felt robbed by this game, because if there is a chance that the cancelled SH game might resurface , no matter how small the chance is, AW2 has already stole many ideas from it. They might have to go with a new concept, which can be a good or a bad thing.

I mean why so tediously copying RE Remake at to this level? why cant AW be its own thing? I mean RE series used to be a ripoff of ALONE in the DARK series, but over time, it has left all the things that they copy from AotD behind, moved on, and it has now become its own thing. And it has paid off, and it was proven to be successful with RE4 (original), RE2 Remake, and RE7. I am sure the team behind AW can do the same, be its own thing, and not trying hard to mimic something else, and be successful. I've played Amnesia, I can safely say its not ripping off RE, and its a successful series, now. So you dont need to rip off RE to be a good horror game. Its evident. The first AW game was clearly inspired by Silent Hill, with a guy visiting a remote town, had a car crash, female family member missing, dual worlds, etc. It feels like the franchise is constantly trying to mimic whatever is cool at their time. I hope the made a bald move with AW3, move away from mimicking other game so blatantly, and reap its benefit, just like RE series did. This series has potential, seriously. it has some original ideas, like using light to protect the character from the enemies as well as weakening the enemies, or changing scenery by re-writing it, or by using the angel lamp stuff thing. But sadly the dev felt the need to be Resident Evil, and it makes the game cringe worthy, and it overwhelms all the original ideas the game has in the fist place.

I'm writing this at 3 AM, staring at a flickering Chromebook that's older than my little sister. The fan sounds like a dying lawnmower, but it's the only thing keeping me company tonight. I'm 16, and I feel like I've lived three lifetimes already. Let me try to explain, not for pity, but because I need to know if anyone out there *gets it*.

# Part 1: The Kid Who Wanted to Touch the Stars

When I was 7, I nearly died. Not in some poetic ""dark night of the soul"" way—I mean *actually* died. Doctors cut me open twice for a surgery they botched, and for weeks, I drifted in and out of fever dreams. I remember two things: the smell of antiseptic, and begging my dad for a telescope.

""Why?"" he asked, exhausted. ""Because if I die,"" I said, ""I want to memorize the stars first.""

I didn't die. But that hunger to *know*, to *touch* things bigger than myself, never left. By 9, I was sketching ""infinite energy machines"" (they looked like blenders hooked to car engines). By 10, I'd convinced 1,000 strangers online that my blurry Honda Civic photos were art. Life felt like a game I was winning... until it wasn't.

# Part 2: The Cracks in the Wall

Puberty hit me like a truck. Suddenly, the Quran verses I'd memorized felt... sticky. Like someone else's words glued to my tongue. I'd lie awake asking questions that terrified me:

* *If God is all-powerful, why do kids in Gaza pray for food while billionaires build rockets?*
* *Who created God? And if no one did, why can't the universe be its own creator?*

I fought it. Oh, I *fought*. I became ""That Muslim Kid"" on Reddit, arguing with atheists at 2 AM. I quoted scientific miracles in the Quran, desperate to prove I wasn't wrong. But the harder I pushed, the more the walls cracked.

Then, one night, I broke my phone. No more debates. No more distractions. Just me, a $50 Chromebook, and a void so loud it hummed.

# Part 3: How Linux Saved My Life (No, Really)

That Chromebook became my escape hatch. I taught myself to nuke Chrome OS and install Linux, not because I'm a prodigy, but because I had nothing left to lose. For weeks, I drowned in error messages and coffee. But when Arch Linux finally booted up? I cried.

Here's why: **Linux doesn't lie**. It doesn't say ""Trust me, I'm perfect."" It says, *""Here's the code. Break it. Fix it. Make it yours.""* For the first time, I felt... control.

# Part 4: Black Holes and Bad Ideas

Now, I'm obsessed with two things:

1. **Quantum physics** (specifically, whether black holes are cosmic USB drives that *encrypt* information instead of destroying it).
2. **Building a video game** where you fight Greek gods using quantum entanglement (imagine Hades meets *Interstellar*).

Does any of this make sense? Probably not. My ""game"" is currently a PNG of a stick figure, and my black hole theory would get me laughed out of any real physics class. But here's the thing: **I don't care**. For the first time, I'm asking questions *for me*, not for God, parents, or imaginary internet points.

# Why Am I Posting This?

Because I'm tired of screaming into the void. I need to know:

* **Ex-Muslims**: How did you rebuild your purpose?
* **Physics nerds**: Am I insane for thinking about quantum encryption in black holes?
* **Anyone**: How do you keep dreaming when the world keeps saying *""Grow up""*?

**TL;DR:** 16-year-old survives bad surgery, loses faith, falls in love with Linux, and now wants to turn black holes into video game bosses. Seeking others who see the universe as a question mark.

**P.S.** If you've read this far, you're already my favorite person today.",10,1743844737.0,exmuslim,5,0.92,False
1jrzf5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1jrzf5e/felt_weak_and_damaged/,Felt weak and damaged,"Hey guys

Just last week itself the girl I liked had told me that she had once considered me as a partner and for a relationship but now she doesn’t have such sorts of feelings over me as circumstances came over, and we parted ways after that. We were good as a couple till then, went around and had fun too together, we’ve both had our moments. 

So I had stopped speaking to her as it was better for my healing and she was ok with that too, since she was ok to be my close friend but I was seeing her more than a friend. 

But yesterday i.e, Friday after 1 week of no-contact, no calls or texts and just because her birthday is on Sunday i.e. tomorrow and also as she was going to her hometown and I might not be able to meet her till Wednesday, I went ahead and spoke with her and broke this rule of no contact, just to wish her a happy birthday 

This is her first birthday ever since we got together and I felt it would be bad not to wish her in person, and also since we were parting ways I would never get a chance to wish her too in the future, so that was the plan and I took a chance just to wish her and nothing else

So I knew about her well enough to know at what time she usually takes the metro to the bus stop when she usually goes to her hometown and I waited for her near a coffee shop and met her on there while she was leaving 

At first we were all formal and cold talks for few minutes but after some time we both were talking as if nothing happened the last 5-6 days. She told that she was angry on me and it looked funny at the same time too me trying hard to ignore her. We just shared some light moments and laughed around, and we held hands too while crossing road to the metro station and she didn’t protest or pull back her hand. She herself bought me a platform ticket too. 

There again while waiting on the platform we had a casual talk and a light moment, I conveyed her my advance birthday wishes and also gave her a toffee that I had in my pocket. We spoke for sometime and when the metro coach came I shook her hand wishing her safe journey and I held her hand in a flirting way and didn’t let go off it till the last second and she was fighting (but enjoying it) with me to let me leave her hand. Finally she ran into the metro as the doors were closing and looked back with a smile and waved me a goodbye. 

The entire moment was good but I had plans to just meet her for 2 mins wish her a happy birthday and come back, that’s the reason I hadn’t bought any chocolate or anything. 

Now I’m feeling very weak and low since I have broken the no contact rule, and she would be thinking that I’m still in her control. She will take me for granted now even though she had clearly told me that she don’t have any feelings now. 

I feel bad since I went as a strong man and I fell weak around her and gave myself in. I don’t know what she would have thought of me although she too seemed to be happy that I was back talking with her but just as a friend. I feel that 1 week of hard no contact went to vain, she was already getting affected by my silence and ignorance. Now everything’s gone. 

Guys please help me whether I’m thing right or what I did yesterday was wrong or not. Hope you guys feel me. What am I supposed to do now? She might be thinking that I’m still having feelings for her and I’m not trying to move on. Also I doubt that she would consider me again. So I’m a bit confused with these mixed emotions and looking for clarity. 

Thanks in advance. ",1,1743844258.0,TeenIndia,0,1.0,False

We hadn’t met before, just planned to get coffee and talk.

Now I’m 6'3"", decently built, and I usually try to carry myself with some manners — so when we met, I stood up, greeted her, asked her to sit, and we started chatting in English. It was a polite, respectful kind of vibe.

And then out of nowhere, this girl from another table comes up to me and says, “I really like the way you carry yourself. You’re very handsome.”
I was just sitting there, lowkey blushing and super confused. She told me her name (which I now completely forgot) and just... rushed out. One of her friends came up later and apologized on her behalf, saying she’s a little shy.

My date didn’t exactly appreciate the interruption — she kept it chill but I could tell she wasn’t thrilled.

Honestly? The girl who approached me was really cute and I kinda wish I had her contact or remembered her name. Never thought something like that would happen here in Jodhpur of all places lol.

1jrzdlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/salesforce/comments/1jrzdlx/been_a_tough_7_months_seeking_a_new_salesforce/,Been a tough 7 months seeking a new Salesforce role.,"I don’t know if what I’m feeling is crushed or just defeated.

I first decided to pivot into this industry back in 2022, just by slowly working through all the Trailhead modules. I started becoming more familiar with the active and engaging community, and learning how many different roles you could branch out into.

Eventually, I went on to earn my Admin and Platform App Builder certs to get the ball rolling. Around the same time, I started having coffee chats with folks in my city Toronto, and connecting with pretty much anyone I met on LinkedIn along the journey. I really did meet some amazing people. That network and effort eventually led to me landing my first Salesforce Admin role in May 2024 at a local consulting company.

It was one of the proudest moments of my life. I had no background experience. just pure grind and determination to get to that point.

I knew this was going to be a continuous learning journey, and I was so ready for it. The people, the projects, the work. It was everything I had hoped for. I started writing out long-term goals. Getting more Salesforce certs, learning 3rd party tools based on project needs, and just growing into the role. Everything felt like it was lining up.

But then, after just 6 months. By the end of September, I got pulled into a meeting that I thought would be a regular weekly check in. Instead, I was told I was being let go, along with a few other Salesforce Admins.

I was in complete shock. I had no idea that decision was coming.
But I’ve come to understand, it’s the nature of consulting. The feedback they gave me was that the speed at which I was picking up new skills wasn’t quite meeting their expectations, and the suggestion was that I should look for an in house Salesforce role instead of consulting. Something where I could focus on just one project rather than juggling five at once.

It was hard to hear. And honestly, it felt unfair to be let go on such short notice. I could literally write down my reasonings here. 
But at the same time, they were also working within the constraints of client budgets, and I had to force myself to see their perspective.

Since then, it’s been hard. Really hard.

I’ve been trying to find roles that match my level of experience, but they’re few and far between. I’ve tapped into my existing network, reached out to new people, and repeated everything I did just a year ago to land my first role. but this time, it feels different. Maybe the market’s more saturated. Maybe the job market is just rougher in general.

Either way, I’ve submitted over 120+ applications. Some with referrals, across North America and even a few globally. As a Canadian, Im really seeing how difficult it is to break into the U.S. market, and the Salesforce job scene here in Canada feels limited.

I’ve been fortunate to land 5 interviews over the last 7 months, but each time they’ve chosen to move forward with someone else. It makes me wonder if I’m missing something. Maybe a soft skill, or maybe I just need more experience.

At this point, my EI is about to run out, and I’m thinking about going back to school.

1jrz8in,https://www.reddit.com/r/omniremovals/comments/1jrz8in/how_to_manage_stress_when_moving_house/,How To Manage Stress When Moving House,"Moving can be a rewarding and exciting experience, whether it's becoming a first-time homeowner or relocating to a new family home. It offers a fresh start in a new area and the opportunity to meet new people.

Although moving can be stressful at times, there are plenty of ways to make the process smoother. For instance, staying organized and booking a [moving company](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/house-removals/) well in advance can significantly reduce stress. In this guide, we've put together 10 practical tips to help you navigate the challenges of moving house with ease.

# Tips To Cope With Moving House Stress

Here are some of our best tips to reduce house moving stress. These will help to ensure you are fully prepared for moving day:

# 1. Create A To-Do List

Before starting your move, it's helpful to create a [moving house checklist](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/moving-house-checklist/) to keep track of all the tasks you need to complete. This simple step can go a long way in reducing any stress related to the move. By following your checklist step by step, you’ll ensure nothing is overlooked.

Here are some things you can add to your to-do list:

# Choosing a moving day

# Booking a removals company

# Purchasing packing materials

# Creating an inventory of items to pack

# Making time to pack items

# Create a list of items to get rid of or sell

# [Get rid of rubbish](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/blog/moving-house-etiquette/) when moving house

# 2. Start Packing Early

Starting to pack early helps you stay organised and ensures everything is ready before moving day.

The exact timing depends on your personal preference, but it’s generally recommended to begin packing around 7 weeks before your moving date. This gives you plenty of time to get everything packed and well-organised.

Here are some quick packing tips to follow:

# Pack items room by room to keep everything organised and in the correct places for unpacking

# Pack clothes you wear the least as it’s unlikely you will wear these before your move

# Pack books you won't read. Place these in a suitcase as this can hold more weight than a cardboard box

# Pack kitchen utensils and equipment that aren’t used every day

# Pack important documents such as birth/marriage certificates in one box. Label the box clearly to ensure it doesn’t get lost

# 3. Plan Ahead

It’s important to plan well in advance for all potential eventualities. Careful planning will help you to avoid additional moving stress. Make a list of everything that needs doing so that you can plan accordingly.

Here are some things to consider doing before your move:

# Book time off work

# Book your removal company in advance

# Organise moving with pets

# Have a deep clean of your old home

# Begin the packing and decluttering process well in advance

# Contact a new school if you’re moving with children

# Use up any perishable goods and food you have

# Cancel bills and contracts connected to your current house

# Change your address for important documents/deliveries

# Set up essentials like gas/electricity/water/[broadband](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/blog/how-to-change-broadband-when-moving-house/) for your new house.

Planning can help to prevent any unexpected or additional expenses. Keeping track of your budget and having money saved to cover expenses can remove the stress of unexpected costs. It also helps to prevent money worries.

# 4. Use a Removal Company

Choosing the right removal company for your move will help to reduce moving stress and anxiety. Removal companies can relieve pressure as they carry out all the organisation and heavy lifting for you.

A removal company will:

# Be fully experienced in moving heavy items, they will avoid damage to walls and floors

# Lift, load and unload boxes for you

# Provide a partial or full packing service to avoid moving stress

# Offer to disassemble/reassemble your furniture

# Often provide both [removal and storage services](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/blog/removals-and-storage/).

By using Omni Removals, you could save up to £700 on your [removal costs.](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/removal-company-cost/) If you're concerned about the expenses of moving, it's a good idea to budget in advance.

Additionally, a comparison website allows you to compare different quotes, helping you find the most cost-effective option. Many removal companies also offer packing services and storage solutions.

House clearance services can be extremely helpful when moving. These companies will collect and dispose of any unwanted items safely and legally, saving you the hassle of transporting bulky items like appliances and furniture to your new home. You can find affordable house clearance services by comparing quotes through us.

# 5. Focus on the Positives

Concentrating on the positive aspects of your move is a useful way to help reduce moving house stress. Not only will this help your mental well-being, but it will also help to offset any negative emotions you may have.

Some pros for moving house include:

# A chance to start fresh in a new neighbourhood

# You’ll have a blank canvas to decorate

# You may have more space, a garden or a spare bedroom to utilise

# Moving nearer friends or family

# Opportunity to make new friends and find new hobbies

# Commute to work may be shorter

# Getting on the property ladder

# 6. Ask For Help

Whether it be from an insured, removal company or your friends and family, getting help is essential in tackling the moving stress. Even if you are an experienced mover, the more people you have on hand to help, the easier your home-buying process will be.

Here are some ways you can receive help:

# Get your friends/family to help pack and clean your old home

# Hire a cleaner to clean your old home

# Hire a removal company. They will carry out the difficult aspects of the move for you. This can include packing, lifting and loading

# Accept help from your neighbours if they offer

# Use Omni Removals to compare removal quotes. This will help you to save time and money. Our services eliminate the stress of having to find a trusted and verified removal company yourself.

# See if you qualify for a DWP moving house grant

# 7. Pack a Bag of Essentials

There are some essentials you won’t want to be packed away with everything else. This is why it’s useful to have a bag of essentials to hand during and after your move.

Items to keep handy for the first few days include:

# Medication

# Toiletries (e.g. toothpaste, shower gel, soap, and face wash)

# Toilet and kitchen roll

# Underwear, a change of clothes and pyjamas

# Phone charger/laptop charger

# Toys for children or pets

# Kitchen essentials (e.g. milk, cutlery, tea and coffee)

# Anything that you use daily (this can vary from person to person)

# 8. Get Rest

Moving home is an extremely busy and tiring time. You shouldn't push yourself too hard throughout the moving process. Ensuring you get enough sleep and rest during this time is important.

You can look after yourself by:

# Make sure you’re getting enough sleep

# Take regular breaks from packing and unpacking

# Take your time with packing and do not rush the process

# Eat well and keep hydrated through the process

# 9. Choose a Moving Day that Best Suits Your Needs

To help reduce stress, it's important to choose a moving day that aligns with your needs. Planning your move around your schedule and selecting a time that works best for you can make the process much smoother and more relaxed.

If you're hiring a removal company, it's a good idea to book as early as possible. This will give you the flexibility to select the most convenient time and day.

According to research by Omni Removals, Friday is the most popular day for moving. A Friday move gives you the entire weekend to unpack and settle in. Moving on the Friday before a bank holiday offers an added bonus—an extra day to adjust to your new home.

# 10. Meditation

Moving house involves a significant amount of physical effort, which can often lead to stress and anxiety. Will Williams, the founding teacher at Beeja Meditation, notes that moving is a perfect example of how a ""positive"" life event can place strain on the nervous system. He explains that people often feel ""overwhelmed"" and ""emotionally very challenged"" during this time.

To combat the stress, Williams recommends meditation as a helpful tool. It is one piece of professional advice that can guide you through the process, offering clarity and perspective.

He describes meditation as ""incredible for calming the nervous system,"" allowing you to gain extra mental bandwidth. This can help you navigate significant life events like moving house with more ease, enabling you to enjoy the process, maintain healthy relationships, and stay balanced during a busy time.

# Why is Moving House So Stressful?

Here are some reasons why you might feel stressed when moving house:

# It’s a big life change for all family members

# The packing process

# Leaving friends and family behind

# Feeling unprepared

# Physical labour of the move

# Financial strain

The stress of moving house affects people in different ways. For some, it may feel like a routine task with little to no stress. However, for others, it can become a significant source of anxiety.

Moving house inevitably brings about psychological effects due to the major changes involved. It often means uprooting your life and potentially leaving behind familiar surroundings and important relationships. If you’re feeling anxious, it's essential to identify the aspects of the process that may trigger stress.

According to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, a ""major change in living conditions"" ranks as the 28th most stressful life event. While it may not be at the top of the list, the emotional impact of moving should not be underestimated.

1jrz722,https://www.reddit.com/r/Morocco/comments/1jrz722/the_day_my_mom_shut_down_the_entire_port_of/,The day my mom shut down the entire port of Tangier.,"I was just reading some stories about people’s experiences with Moroccan customs, and it reminded me of something that happened to me a long time ago. Honestly, it’s one of the funniest things I’ve ever witnessed, so I figured—why not share it with you all?

I was born and raised in the Netherlands, but like almost every Moroccan family in Europe, we used to make that long road trip to Morocco every summer, crammed into a van with the whole family. You know the drill—those classic summer migration scenes. In our case, my dad had just bought a new van that year, a bright green Hyundai H100—so yeah, we weren’t exactly low-key. As usual, the van was packed: dad behind the wheel, mom in the passenger seat, me, my brother, and little sister in the back.

We arrive in Tangier, and it’s peak summer, so it’s insanely crowded. If you know the port of Tangier, you know there are two checkpoints. The first one is more of an observation point where they decide whether to pull you aside, and the second is where they check your papers and passports, which you usually filled out and had stamped on the ferry.

This was in the mid-90s, a time when things were tense due to terrorism threats. Stuff where also tense at our neighbours due to terrorism, thus Morocco was on high alert. Customs and police were extra strict. We had the Marrakech attacks the summers before and They had even found weapons being smuggled by Islamic extremists in that period, so the country wasn’t taking any chances.

Now, my dad has always been religious, but not in an extreme way. He’s not into politics either. But he did have a beard, and when traveling to Morocco, he’d wear a djellaba—for comfort. He was around 48 at the time but looked more like he was in his late 30s begin 40s. Back then, most Moroccan men that age had mustaches, not beards. Add to that the shiny new van, and you get why we caught the attention of the customs officer.

Now here’s something you need to know about my parents: my dad is a Soussi, and my mom is 7yania. If you’re not familiar, Hyayna tribes are from between Fès, Taza, and just under the Rif. My dad is a textbook Soussi: calm, patient, soft-spoken, and has absolutely zero time for drama. My mom is the exact opposite. People from the Rif and northern regions will know the type: Demha 7arr!

My mom was the youngest of 13 kids. By the time she was born, my grandfather (Allah yrahmou) was nearly 50. He was a respected and well known man in the 7yayna tribe, he could be considered a leading figure in the Hyayna. Her older siblings feared him, they could not even look him the yes when they where young…. but by the time my mom came along, he had softened and was not as though and strict on her as he was for his other children… So my mom grew up without the fear of autorithy that the rest of her siblings grew up wit hit…and that kinda shaped her personality.

So….We got pulled over at the first checkpoint in Tanger customs, my dad  parked the van, and a gendarmie  asked us to open the trunk. My mom had packed the car in the Netherlands—and by “packed,” I mean my brother and I (10 and 14 at the time) had to stack everything properly—so she was held responsible to oversee the inspection. My dad handed her the keys, picked up my 4-year-old sister, strolled to the kiosk, bought a newspaper, and sat down at the nearby café with a cup of coffee like it was just another day.

He was relaxed. He didn’t care. He was just glad we made it safely to Morocco and honestly understood the whole situation. My mom? She was fuming. She saw it as pure l7agra,  three tamarra dyal triq and now this?

She was getting more and more irritated by the gendarmies attitude. But we had no choice. The gendarmie pointed tot he trunk of the van and ordered: “Habbet” ….ewa me and my brother had to habbet the whole trunk of the van They searched everything, obviously found nothing, and oredered us to loaded it all back in. Two hours, gone.

It’s now middel in the afternoon in Tangier in July—blazing sun. After we packed up again, my dad got called back from the café. He started the van, and about 15 minutes later we reached the second checkpoint. This one is usually just paperwork since they knew we had just been fully searched. My dad figured it would be quick.

To his surprise, we got pulled over again. Another gendarmie walked up and said we had to open the trunk. Again.

My dad gave the keys to my mom. Now listen—I've never seen my mom as angry as she was in that moment. The look she gave the gendarmie said: *""* *“Hada ghan 9ouj dinnemou.”.*

She got out of the van, marched up to the gendarmie, and said, “We were just inspected. What is this nonsense?” He didn’t care. But it was obvious what he *did* care about: he wanted money.

Now my dad is a religious man. He doesn’t do reshwa. Doesn’t speed. Always wears his seatbelt. If he broke a rule and got the fine, he deserved to be fined no discussion, but when he has done nothing wrong, hew wont pay and you dont even have to try it. My mom? She also doesn’t bribe—but in this case out of pure *spite.* If you want money from her? *Wellah, mat shemha!*

So my brother and I had to unload everything again. This time, they barely even looked. They just wanted to pressure us. But when the officer realized he wasn’t getting anything, he said, “Yalla Safi, Talla3.”

Me and my brother were just about to start reloading when my mom suddenly screamed at us —no joke, she yelled:

**“Li t7arrek fikoum ghan dba7 dindbabba!!”**

The officer froze. He didn’t see that coming. My mom looked him dead in the eye and said:**“Wallah man charge!”**

Officer: “Kifesh ma ghat chargez?  
Mom: Wallah ma ghan charge.”

The guy didn’t know what to do. He looked over at my dad, who was still sitting calmly in the shade reading his newspaper. He asked my dad to talk to his wife. My dad’s response—*and I swear to God this was word for word*—was: “Binatkoum”

The officer was lost. And of course, in true Moroccan fashion, a crowd started to form. Whenever there’s drama, mgharba gather. More officers showed up, begging my mom to calm down and just reload the van. She ignored them completely.

One even asked me and my brother to help, but we were offcourse more affraid  of our mom than we were of the Makhzen

Traffic in the port completely stopped. Another ferry had just arrived, so it only got busier. Eventually, they had to escalate the situation. After about an hour, a man showed up—same age as my dad, clean uniform, well-groomed. Clearly someone important. He introduced himself politely and welcomed my mom to Morocco. He knew he had to defuse the situation, not escalate it. He asked her:

“So, where are you headed?”  
Mom: “We’re going to Fès.”  
Him: “Ta ana weld Fès!”

My mom’s response—*and I swear this is what she said*—was:

**“Wakha tkoun ta weld mouy, wallah ma ghan charge!”**

That’s when he knew: *this is a fight I’m never going to win.* Because for him, it was an impossible situation: hundreds of people were already watching what was going on, the entire port was literally paralyzed because no car could pass through anymore. The chief knew he had ended up in an impossible situation — he couldn’t stand there shouting at a woman in front of all these people, and he definitely couldn’t arrest her in front of her own children… with all the people gathered around, it would surely turn into chaos. So he chose the lesser evil.He raised the white flag and said:

**“Denyha henya , sem7ilna al 7ajja.”**

He ordered the gendrames to reload the van. Of course, they didn’t do it themselves—they got the blue-tabliyat porters to do it. All of the gendarme vanished. They had completely lost face and didnt want tob e around my mom

Once the van was reloaded, my dad gave the porters some juice and quietly slipped them a bit of money. And finally, we were on our way to Fès.

That drive from Tangier to Fès was the quietest car ride of my entire life.",30,1743843227.0,Morocco,14,1.0,False

How would you deal with this?","I’ve been talking to a girl from Tinder. We haven’t met yet because she’s busy with college and I’m busy with work, but our conversations have been good.

One day, she mentioned drinking something to help her focus on studying. Sensing where this was going, I offered to buy her a drink—just a common courtesy. The plan was simple: she’d order, and I’d send her the money.

What I didn’t expect was that she ordered the most expensive drink on the menu - with multiple extras. The bill she sent me listed four different toppings. Since I’m not American, this is just an equivalent comparison (not actual prices), but imagine a standard $5 Starbucks drink. Hers ended up costing 35 bucks.""

I was stunned. I’ve paid for more expensive meals before, but this was the first time someone had ordered such a costly drink before we’d even met. That’s nearly a full meal’s price for a single drink. I’ve been on coffee dates before, and no one has ever chosen anything even half that price—let alone before a first meeting.

I still paid, but afterward, my interest dropped to zero. We’re still talking, but the spark is gone. 

Am I overthinking this, or being petty here? Have any of you offered to buy something for someone before meeting, only for them to choose something expensive? If so, how did you handle it?",2,1743843026.0,relationship_advice,29,1.0,False
1jrz52r,https://www.reddit.com/r/LengfOrGirf/comments/1jrz52r/a_rich_man_will_marry_a_mcdonalds_working_girl/,A rich man will marry a McDonalds working girl.,"I just find this analogy to be completely untrue and COMPLETELY “NEW money”

It’s well known fact that people marry within their social and economic class. Look at the sons of billionaires, they marry the daughters of other billionaires who they went to Yale law school with, the girls they met at Oxford, the girls who they met at an Ivy Leauge party. They don’t marry the girl who served them at their local coffee shop because she was pretty.

Doctors wives are almost always other doctors or healthcare professionals. Lawyers wives are almost always other lawyers, politicians wives are almost always women who work in high ranking positions within the corporate world. Truth is, the more money you have the better educated you can afford to be. That’s why almost all children of rich parents attend the best schools, have MBAs and law degrees and engineering degrees.

Of course there are exceptions to the rule, and I do agree that a woman’s degree and status doesn’t matter AS MUCH as a man’s, nor is it the main commodity for a woman, but this idea they preach that a successful man will pick any random, dumb 18 year old girl who’s a nail tech over a college educated woman from the same background as him is stupid. It screams “now that I have money, I need a girl who has nothing going for her so she’s fascinated by my money and will agree to be my slave bang maid and do my business for me. 

In a stream on fedreacts Angie said she finished her psychology degree and was going to go to medical school in Venezuela. I can 100% say that had Angie come here and been allowed to continue her medical studies, or her psychology degree was valid and she was able to work without having to do crappy jobs at a night club, she wouldn’t even look Myron’s way. I mean why would a woman with ANYTHING going for herself agree to be Myron’s slave and possibly get STDs from him.

We've gotten pretty close over that time and have become good friends. We've managed to keep things strictly platonic and have maintained boundaries as far as doing anything sexual with each other as we both know that could get messy. Although I will say there is definitely some sexual tension or maybe just silly flirting that goes on between us quite often but it's never been an issue up to this point and we've never taken it further than that.

Anyway we both work together and one day I went to our coffee shop that's in our store and got a drink from a barista who has been extremely flirty with me (maybe to an uncomfortable degree). She wrote some love note on my cup and I didn't think much of it until my roommate seen it. I know she has issues with a lot of people that work that area of the store because she's had to work with them before and they treated her poorly and a lot of beef and hostility had went on there amongst them. Especially with one barista in particular. But I didn't think (and am still not sure) if she had personal issues with the one who wrote the note on my cup. Well after she seen it she seemingly jokingly said ""now i'm mad at you i'm not talking to you for a few days"" and at first after thinking she was joking I didn't say much. But she then proceeded to legitimately not talk to me at work or at home for maybe a week. I was so confused and really didn't understand why she was mad. We aren't a couple. She has a guy she's currently seeing/talking to. I'm single. It seemed inconsequential to be upset. I didn't think it was just jealousy. So I figured maybe she really hated that barista or something. She eventually started talking to me again as if nothing happened. I know I should have questioned her then and there and asked what that was all about. But I didn't want to make her upset again or ruin the return to normalcy we had going on so I figured I'd ask her about it at a later date when it was more in the past.

Fast forward about a week later maybe. Once again I go get a drink from the same barista. Share a couple jokes with her and the other barista that my roommate hates but nothing crazy.  And as I leave the coffee shop area with my drink my roommate happens to be working right up front where she can see me and was presumably watching me that whole time. As I walk by she gives me a look and simply says ""you're a traitorous bitch. You wanna be laughing over there with them being fake. That's why I didn't talk to you for a while and now I'm not gonna talk to you again."" And she hasn't. Now I'm just here wondering if I really did something wrong or if she's simply over reacting.

Sharing the load edition.,"I just a bit of neutral perspective on my situation, because I can’t figure out if I’m overreacting or being sensitive. I’ll try to explain as objectively as possible.

I live with my husband and our two children (3.5 years and 7 months). I am still on maternity leave, will be returning to work full time in July. My husband works full time. His job is extremely demanding and stressful, and he is currently really struggling with the mental load of it. It is affecting his sleep and he is irritable and low in energy. We have discussed possible solutions, including him looking for a new job, but it’s tricky in his industry at the moment. He feels the pressure of it because he is much better paid than me and we wouldn’t be able to pay the mortgage without his salary.

An inevitable side effect of this is that I’m currently doing all of the parenting. I’m not being dramatic or exaggerating, I am doing everything solo apart from bedtime, when he helps by running the bath and making up a bottle for the baby, then we take turns one of us giving the bottle and the other reading to the toddler. But everything else: getting them up, dressed, planning, prepping and feeding meals, dealing with potties and nappies and meltdowns, keeping them entertained during the day, dealing with the night wakes. It feels like he’s checked out because he’s stressed. I think I’ve become more aware/upset about it because I thought I would at least get a coffee in bed and ten minutes peace on Mother’s Day, but I didn’t. 

For an example, this morning I got the children and myself up and dressed and brought us all down for breakfast. My husband appeared maybe an hour later, ignored the children, told me grumpily that he’d had a terrible night’s sleep and went back to bed. It’s a beautiful sunny day and I want to make the most of it, so I’ll be taking both children out on my own, as well as possibly attempting a supermarket shop (insane on a Saturday morning but needs to be done!)

This is sustainable (if depressing) for now but I’m so worried about going back to work. 

Has anyone else experienced this and if so were you able to make a positive change? It feels kind of hopeless at the moment and like he almost doesn’t want it to change. Every suggestion I make to improve things for both of us is dismissed. If it helps for context, generally our marriage is ok, I’m working really hard not to let resentment build and we still get on well and happily spend time together in the evenings. We are both able to get out of an evening and see friends, and we try to make sure we each do this at least once a month for a bit of grown up sociable time. We haven’t had a date night in forever but baby has just got to the point where we mostly do get an evening, so it wouldn’t be impossible to plan one.

This was such a ramble, thank you to anyone who made it to the end!

To the point where unless told otherwise i just assume he’s coming here and when he isnt my roommate asks where he is. He has a habit of staying out with his friends for a few days at a time. Its to the point where the first question i ask when he says he’s going to see one of them is “You coming back today or tomorrow?”. I don’t mind that he does this. If anything its nice at times. What gets me is that he will say one time and come back much later. I actually talked about this to him once, as he would routinely say he was going to be back that night, then just stay overnight without so much as a text. I would stay up waiting for him to get back since he said he’d be back, only to realize at a certain point he did it again. It drove me nuts but he stopped.

Fast forward to now. About 4-5 days ago (ive honestly lost track) he told me he was going to go out for dinner. Said he would be back the next day. Didn’t happen. Honestly i was just a little sad. But then he said something that just made my blood boil 

I (admittedly spontaneously) decided to pack up for a couple days and go camping. I called him to ask if we could grab coffee or something first since id be gone for a couple days. He has plans. Whatever. Thats fine. But he says to me 

“I wish you would have told me sooner i would have wanted to see you first”

And it didnt hit me at first. But now im thinking about it and my blood is just absolutely boiling. So you can just leave for almost a week without even a text but i was supposed to give 24 advanced notice for a 2 day trip?! Im honestly sick of it! I dont even care what he gets up to as long as he’s not sleeping with someone else. I literally just want to know when he will or will not be here. I feel like thats not a crazy thing to ask! Just a “oh heads up i won’t be back until monday” is literally all i ask for! I dont understand why thats so difficult. Not to mention this will be my second time bringing it up and im not one for repeating myself.

I havent said anything to him yet because im debating how to. My initial reaction is to get mad but i know thats not productive. But i need this to sink in because like i said, im not one for repeating myself. Even a small issue can become a deal breaker if i have to say it over and over.

I just. Feel kind of crazy. Because its just a text. Not that big of a deal. But on the other hand! Just send the damn text! AIO?

1jrywq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/omniremovals/comments/1jrywq9/moving_house_essentials/,Moving House Essentials,"After the excitement of finding the perfect home, the time has come to move in. Amid all the chaos and anticipation, it's easy to forget about the essential items you'll need for a smooth transition. That's why it's crucial to stay organised in advance. Moving day can be a whirlwind, and to make sure you're ready, packing a survival kit is key.

In the days leading up to the arrival of the [removal company](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/house-removals/), set aside time to gather your moving essentials. Having them ready will make your first day in your new home much more manageable. To help you get organised, Omni Removals has created this guide to ensure you don’t miss anything important.

Once you arrive at your new home, you won’t want to spend hours unpacking everything. Instead, keep your moving essentials with you so you can quickly settle in, without having to unpack the entire household right away.

# 1. Moving House Essentials Box

Also known as a moving house survival kit, the moving house essentials box should contain everything you'll need to have within easy reach during your move. Each family member may have different requirements, so be sure to tailor the box accordingly. If you're [moving with children](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/blog/how-to-move-house-with-children), don’t forget to pack a separate essentials box for them, filled with their favourite toys and snacks to keep them entertained during the move.

Your moving house essentials box should include all the vital items you use every day. This could include medication, phone chargers, food, bottled water, pyjamas, toiletries, a change of clothes, and a first-aid kit. Essentially, pack anything you would need if you were staying somewhere other than your own home. For more guidance, check out our [moving checklist](https://www.omniremovals.co.uk/moving-house-checklist/) to help you stay organised.

# 2. Bedding

Moving and unpacking can take several hours, depending on the length of the journey and the amount of stuff you have. The last thing you want is to waste time searching for your bedding after a long day of moving when you, or your little ones, just want to get some rest.

To make things easier, pack your bedding separately in a clearly labelled bag or box, and make sure it's easily accessible. This way, you can quickly set up your bed as soon as you arrive at your new home, helping you settle in comfortably after a long day of moving.

# 3. Towels and Toiletries

It may seem obvious to keep essentials like towels, shower gel, a shower curtain (if needed), toothpaste, and your toothbrush close by, but it’s easy to forget during the hectic rush of moving day. Make sure everyone has access to these essentials so you can all shower and brush your teeth without having to unpack everything.

Having these items readily available will minimize stress on your first night, allowing you and your family to refresh, get ready for bed, and feel prepared for the following day—no matter how much unpacking is left to do.

# 4. Kitchen Essentials

Being able to make a cup of tea or coffee is a must for many people during the busy process of moving and settling into a new home. Ensure your kettle, mugs, tea, coffee, sugar, snacks, and bottled water are all packed separately so they’re easily accessible.

Cooking essentials are also a good idea, as you may want to prepare a meal during the unpacking process. While some may prefer to order takeaway, others might want to try out their new kitchen right away. Having these items set aside will make the moving day a lot easier and more manageable.

# 5. Toilet Paper

Toilet paper is one of those essentials that’s easy to overlook during the chaos of moving, but it’s something you’ll definitely need as soon as you arrive at your new home. If the journey is long, you can bet everyone will need a bathroom break once they get there. Accidents can happen, especially if you’re moving with children or pets, so keeping toilet paper within reach in the car is a simple way to avoid any stress or discomfort when you arrive.

# 6. Toolbox

You don’t need a professional kit, but the basics may be needed to get you through the first few days. A small toolkit will come in handy for the dismantling or reassembling of furniture or any last-minute DIY work that’s needed.

Below we've listed a few items you may need:

# Flathead Screwdriver

# Phillips Screwdriver

# Hammer

# Pliers

# Drill

# Basic Screws

# Wall plugs

# Tape

# Box cutter and/or scissors

# Torch

# Batteries

# 7. Cleaning Products

Another category of items you'll want to have to hand when you move into a new home is cleaning products. Hopefully, the previous owner will have cleaned and maintained the home for when you move in, but unfortunately, this isn't always the case. Furthermore, with everyone walking in and out and the removals team helping with the unpacking, the floor may get dirty quickly.

Before furniture is put in place and boxes are unpacked, you may want to clean your new house ready for you to settle in. Below we've listed the cleaning necessities you may want to have with you:

# Cleaning cloths

# All-purpose spray

# Dish soap

# Scourer

# Rubber Gloves

# Dustpan and brush

# Vacuum

# Bin liners and recycling bags

Items such as baking soda or bicarbonate of soda and white vinegar can also work wonders and are less harsh than many commercial cleaning products.

It opens straight away with coffee, like just coffee, which is a little overpowering because you smell like an espresso for a couple minutes, but the lemon and patchouli come through and make it a bit more light and rounded, reminiscent of a tiramisu. Plus, this is really strong, I sprays one spray on my top at boots and 2 hours later I was with my mum in the supermarket and was stopped by a lady who asked what my mum was wearing before realising it was me she could smell.

1jryvbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYcritics/comments/1jryvbv/im_taking_steps_rwby_vol_13_review/,I'm taking steps! (RWBY Vol. 1-3 Review),"About 2 weeks ago, I said that I hung around this subreddit for a bit but hasn't watched RWBY yet, so I decided to just... watch it. I watched one to two episodes a day and I just finished Vol. 3! Here are just some thoughts I have about these 3 volumes overall, feel free to share yours. 

**(Do note that I am looking at the show in a vacuum and not considering additional content, author intent, or anything behind-the-scenes.)**

**(I also did NOT watch Ice Queendom.)**

The first thing that I will praise RWBY for is its action scenes, which are very fluid and dynamic, something that makes them very fun and exciting to watch. This is to be expected from a show that focuses a lot on high speed combat and monster slaying. Sometimes the ""weight"" of the strikes can feel rather inconsistent but it's never been a significant issue. 

With that out of the way, let's move onto the *not* as good parts. 

**When I watched Vol. 1 and 2, I felt exactly three different ways: bored, mildly amused, and frustrated.** 

Bored because it's simply not very super engaging for me, not just the dialogues but also how a lot of developments are done through dialogues. It often falls into the trap of ""telling instead of showing"", and while I don't think it's a massive flaw, it made things less interesting.  

Mildly amused because of teenager antics and the occasional cartoonish humor. 

Frustrated because these two volumes feel like massive missed opportunities. Despite Beacon being a prestigious Huntsman Academy, it doesn't feel that way because not only do we only ever see three teachers, one of them (Glinda) is an excuse to have two characters fight and two of them (Port and Oobleck) teaches lessons in an incredibly droll manner (I'm assuming this is for the sake of humor, but it still kind of sucks). 

What makes this more annoying is that the show can clearly have the professors teach in an interesting manner, because that one scene of Oobleck showing Ruby a bunch of marching Goliaths (mammoth grimms) is **incredible** and single-handedly changed my perception of this coffee-loving man, and it *isn't even a lecture.* Outside of this one scene, the classes are just portrayed as... boring. 

Moreover, these two Volumes spent very little time actually telling you about Remnant, with the major tidbit we got being racism against Faunus. This is *especially* frustrating because the setting is a **school**, meaning it's the *perfect* opportunity to tell the audience about the world through the lessons that the students actually learn. Which brings me back to the marching Goliaths scene, which was amazing because it showed off how rich this world's history is and even gave us a peek into grimm's biology and behavior from the perspective of someone who's been studying them for a long time. 

**Now, Vol. 3 is where it gets good:** 

First things first, it is paced fairly well, enough to keep me engaged with what's happening in the story, which does a *very* good job of showing just how out of their depth Team RWBY is, which *also* makes sense because they're a bunch of fresh Huntsmen who has barely gone on any missions and still throws food fights in the cafeteria (with a dash of superpowers). 

Speaking of depth, the plan enacted by Cinder, Emerald, and Mercury is fantastic because it actually exploits something that we have been told about the grimm again and again: they are drawn by negative emotions, the more intense the stronger the attraction is. I do wish they explain more about the process of the programs and such that they used to overtake the broadcasts, but that's not a biggie. 

Now, onto something that I feel rather iffy about: the fight scenes. In Vol. 1 and 2, the fights feel dynamic and the swings have weight behind them, and that holds true in Vol. 3... mostly. Sometimes the fights will cut to these ""flash cuts"" where the characters are made to ""teleport"" around to show off their speed. I think this works well for Cinder vs Ozpin, but not the other fights. 

Now, onto the biggest problem with Vol. 3, which *isn't* even something it did wrong. Volume 3 is, by all means, very good overall at establishing that things are about to take a turn for the worse, which they do. The main characters are soundly defeated, Pyrrha outright *dies*, Beacon is destroyed, and the antagonists have... pretty much succeeded. 

Unfortunately, Volume 1 and 2 didn't do enough to actually make me **care** about Beacon. They managed to make me care somewhat about the characters that I actually felt sad and dismayed when they are completely defeated and when Pyrrha is *executed* right in front of Ruby, but I have never been attached to the academy itself. Why should I be, when its classes are portrayed as nothing but boring lectures made by old windbags (not you Oobleck, you're cool), and the only competent people are Ozpin and Glynda? Volume 3 did a good job of escalating, it's just too bad it escalated too soon. 

A side note I want to make is Torchwick. I've seen a lot of people expressing frustration about his death before, but I actually thinks his death scene is well done. Torchwick is a crook, a criminal, a jack-of-all-crimes trickster who adapts to his current situation, and he thought that he can survive for longer by allying with Cinder instead of running away or going against them. His unceremonious death showed perfectly just how uncaring his ""allies"" are of the people they use to get their way and how utterly powerless he is. 

To end this review on a positive, I just want to say that the reveal of the narrator being Salem at the very end of Volume 3 is **incredible**. It is an amazing scene that foreshadows the actual main antagonist of this series, and it makes me very excited to watch Vol. 4 and beyond! 

I'll post another review after I finish a Volume or two! 

Edit: I wish they also establish what Weiss’ semblance actually does because all I can tell is that it’s something like a magic system or a discipline as opposed to a single ability. ",3,1743841773.0,RWBYcritics,2,1.0,False

I'm planning a surprise one-day trip to Dallas for my husband's birthday. It'll be a quick in-and-out visit (arriving in the morning and flying out at night via DAL), and the main goal is for him to reconnect with a few friends. He went to UT Dallas and is really into coffee, cars, and watches.

I’m looking for fun, budget-friendly activities or stops that align with his interests—maybe a cool local coffee shop, a car-themed experience (he used to be a fan of Gas Monkey, but I’m not sure if it’s still worth a visit), or a spot with unique watches or horology displays. I have never been to Dallas and would love suggestions on:

(1)Places to eat/drink (great coffee or brunch spots)

(2)Car or watch-related experiences

(3)Chill hangout spots or areas for him to meet friends

(4)A rough itinerary for the day that balances downtime and experiences without feeling rushed
