1i0vq16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nocontactfamily/comments/1i0vq16/my_mom_called_my_therapist_i_want_to_punch_a_wall/,"My mom called my therapist, I want to punch a wall.","I have been no contact with my mom since Christmas. It's not been long and I feel good about my decision. Technically I'd say it's no contact since I only blocked her on whatsapp (most used messaging app in my country), but she can still call me and I have not blocked her on any social media. This is important because if she wanted to reach me, she can. 

Last week I met with my dad, I had really maintained distance from my entire family, since no one is taking my healthcare issues / chronic illness seriously and they just expect me to do more than the rest in any setting. My dad and I had coffee in a café close to my house, and since he was the one to ask to meet up I let him speak first, I wanted to know what he wanted to say. He said he was worried about my mental health, and that he believed I was seeking a diagnosis but that I didn't have health issues, that it was all in my mind. This worried him, because ""I am young and healthy at 31, not like him, who's 71"". His words, not mine. 

I asked how could he be so sure that I am healthy, if in the two years since I told him about my health decline he had never asked about how I was doing, if i needed someone to come with me to a medical appointment, or if I had any medical updates. He said he got that info from my mom. 

I explained that I am not healthy and that being this young and having such chronic pain and symptoms is horrible for me, that doctors have found things that are wrong with me both in blood work and other exams, but that they just don't seem to care enough to fix them. I also told him I was diagnosed by a rheumatologist a few months back. And I told him that my mom knew all of this. He was speechless, she was twisting the information just because she doesn't believe me, so the facts about my diagnosis were irrelevant to her. 

After the meeting he told me he now had a new panorama of my health and that he was very worried, and that he was glad we talked. I told him I was glad he changed his mind, and that I wanted to maintain distance from my mom for the time being, since her actions hurt me a lot. He told me how she was super worried about me and how she wanted to talk to me, and that she didn't hurt me. I explained (because boomer parents never seem to understand this), that while her intentions may have been good, her actions had hurt me. And that this was something that she couldn't deny, because it wasn't up to her, it was up to me to define if I was hurt by her actions. He understood. 

So here's the real kicker: my mom is a psychologist, and she linked me to my current therapist five years ago since they had colleagues in common and someone recommended him to her. Today, my therapist called me to let me know she reached out to him to ask if they could talk about me, because she was really distressed about this situation and worried about me. He wanted me to hear it from him, and said he rejected that ask, since it was not ok. I felt (and still feel) RAGE. HOW DARE HER? THE ONLY REASON SHE HAS HIS CONTACT INFO IS BECAUSE SHE HAS THE SAME PROFESSION, NOT BECAUSE I GAVE IT TO HER. 

ALSO: The only acceptable reason for her to contact my therapist would be if she was worried me committing su1c1d3 or something like that, but other than that... therapy is a private space. 

**IF SHE HAS ANY TYPE OF DISTRESS SHE NEEDS TO GO TO THERAPY HERSELF, NOT COME TO INVADE MY SPACE IN THE NAME OF WORRY.** 

I'm sorry for the rant but **I fucking hate her** and can't believe it took me this long to cut her off when she has made my life miserable since I was 10 years old. ",1,1736821669.0,Nocontactfamily,0,1.0,False

I have an incredible boyfriend who I know would do anything for me. He is a great man, no social media (aside FB), doesn't entertain other women, doesn't hide his phone, faithful; a provider, a hard worker, and wants a family with me. I feel lucky to have a man like this. We've been dating for about 7 months.

However, I find myself having to ask him to do things that shouldn't have to be asked. For example, over the past few months, I've had to ask him to shower properly (I discovered he wasn't washing his ass or his armpits well enough, lol) & I would have to ask him to put on deodorant, brush his teeth, get his clothes off the floor, things I feel like I shouldn't have to ask a grown man to do. Today, these things aren't much of an issue anymore bc he has mostly corrected them. I still have to ask him if he put deodorant on or brushed his teeth, often which the answer is no, but then he goes & does it.

There are other things that I have to ask: he snores & it keeps me up. He got nose strips to try to help that, but he won't put it on unless I ask him to. He has never gone a night where he would take it upon himself to just put it on so he can ensure I get some sleep. I have to ask him to wash dishes (he will put his own dirty dishes in the sink & just leave it there), take out the trash, put the toilet seat down, & put stuff away/put them back. This is all when he stays at my apartment. It really puts me into mommy mode which turns me off.

We don't live together but we talk about wanting to get married & have children. I find myself worrying that I will be married to someone who needs me to ask them to do things in order for them to be done. I worry that if he sees that the dishes aren't done, he won't do them unless I ask. If we have a baby & I am up with the newborn, he won't get up & help me unless I ask. If I come home from being out to the store or seeing a friend, will the house be a mess & dishes in the sink because I didn't ask him to do it? He doesn't think having to ask is a big deal, but as a nurse who works with dementia patients, I know that repeating myself gets really old really fast. I want my partner to be considerate enough to just do what needs to be done without me having to ask.

I need to add that we have a traditional viewpoint on relationships. He wants to provide & take care of me financially & he tells me that I don't need to work if I don't want to. I will be a stay at home wife & care for the house and children, however I do think I might want to work a 8 or 12 hour shift maybe once a week so I can be social & make a little money for fun.

I don't want him to worry about laundry or other cleaning, as I want to take care of all of that for him. I'll also be doing the cooking & taking care of our home. We are in an argument because of this. AITA? Or should I cut him so slack & accept that I will just have to ask him to do things?

  
EDIT* I never said that this man smells. He doesn’t. And he does brush his teeth once a day, but sometimes after a night of drinking and let’s say Taco Bell, I have to ask him to brush them. But he has never smelled bad. He’s incredible in the manner than he is faithful and doesn’t play games. I can go through his phone and there’s nothing to hide. He buys me whatever I want. He works hard and has work ambition, is an electrician with a business. He buys me flowers and chocolate twice a month. Gets up and buys my coffee for me every morning. He tries his best to do whatever I ask of him and I know he is trying his best to make me happy. He no longer leaves clothes on the floor and takes his shoes off before coming in to the apartment—things I’ve asked of him. He showers me in love and words of affirmation every day. But I still find myself mommying him…that is the issue here. 

EDIT** He does wash properly now. I began to notice a tiny bit of BO at one point and then when we started showering together I started to notice he wasn’t washing properly. I know he washes properly now, as he has listened to my advice and taken it…as I said in my post, it has mostly been corrected except for the occasional, “did you put deodorant on??” He is not a lazy smelly scumbag. I was just trying to give detail into how I feel I have fallen into mommy mode",2,1736821600.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False
1i0vp36,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1i0vp36/how_to_refinish_this_coffee_table/,How to refinish this coffee table,"Hey guys, long story short, I'd like to refinish this table, but need advice on what to do. Things like the best method to strip it, best clear coat to use for a coffee table, and how to rebond and straighten the boards that are separating. Read below if you want more details. 

[Here is the table](https://imgur.com/a/prwDIlN)

I recently got this coffee table that I'd like to refinish. It belonged to an uncle who loved woodworking and practiced it his whole life, but recently passed away. He really loved this particular table. It's been passed around in my family for years, but in my uncle's final days, he didn't take very good care of it. He taught me some woodworking growing up, but nothing beyond amateur level skills. 

I'd love to refinish this (although as an amateur I know it won't be perfect), but I need advice on how to go about it. I've refinished some wood projects, but nothing with multiple types of wood or anything as complex as this.

It appears to be hardwood, not vaneer. I'm unsure of what type of clear coat is on it, so I don't know if sanding or a stripper is the best method. Some of the pieces of wood are also separating, so I imagine I will need to reglue them. Some are warped unfortunately, so I'm not sure how to straighten or repair them. Then I wanted advice on what the best clear coat is for a coffee table. I've mostly used polycrylic and lacquer for other projects, but I'm not sure if either of those are suited for this.

Any tips would be highly appreciated. I'd love to use the skills my uncle taught me to restore it as best as I can!",1,1736821590.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

The amount of caffeine in green teas varies depending on factors such as types of tea, brewing method, and temperature.

# How much caffeine is in green tea?

On average, an 8-ounce cup of green tea contains 30 to 50 milligrams of caffeine.

Green tea has less caffeine than black tea and coffee, making it a popular choice for those who want to enjoy the benefits of tea without too much caffeine. The European Food Safety Authority recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of 400mg, making green tea a moderate and safe choice for daily consumption.——Article Source“[Does Green Tea Have Caffeine?](https://dofotea.com/blogs/news/does-green-tea-have-caffeine)”",1,1736821530.0,ChineseTeaCultureNetw,0,1.0,False

One of the members of said-group who didn't partake in the bullying, or so it seemed, had feelings for me.  Just a tiny crush, probably. I thought he was kind of cute. Nothing more. We were in the 'talking stage', which is the best way to put it. One of the girls in the group had it out for him, for too, and took it out on me. She spread false rumors, especially on the internet, like on Discord and DMS in Instagram, and Discord with group chats, and some of the very few people in my social circle turned on me. I became withdrawn with hatred.

She took that opportunity a few months or so to begin dating him, but I didn't care about it. I instead was in tears looking through the messages people said about me on Discord and contemplated ending my life.

There was one thing that I wanted to talk about because I just can't hold it in anymore; when I was talking to him, he mentioned in messages how he had a preference for skinny people. He told me he didn't really like my body shape, which is obviously horrible to tell to a young girl (he was a bit older). I wasn't fat but definitely not skinny either. Like I had back rolls and stuff, but I didn't have a muffin top or body stretches. I also didn't have collarbones.

So I started my exercise campaign, fueled with insecurity. I began drinking herbal drinks, exercising with my own yoga mat my parents bought, and soon lost a lot of weight. I had collarbones and only one back roll around my waist. I looked like a different human being.

During this period the girl did what she did (I don't know by what means) and I almost developed an eating disorder because of how disoriented the image of my body became, not because of him. I'm doing way better now, and I've gained weight, too, but I'm happier with thunder thighs and almost no collarbone. As long as I don't have a double chin, I'll be happy eating.

After transferring schools, the girl did the same. According to my friends from the previous school, she was bullied and kicked out of the friend group. They presume she's still dating him. But every time I see her passing by when changing classes or something I just noticed how sickly and skinny she's become. She didn't look bad back then. She is really pretty!

I staged an intervention today after school where I talked to her with some of my friends staying back in case I needed support. I won't say much but she was pissed off at me. I asked her if the guy was treating her right and even given our history, I'd love to go get a coffee or something. She told me to f off and that I'm an a-hole for worrying about her when I've caused her so much pain. I snapped and asked her how that's possible when she spread things about me but she told me that because I became so withdrawn from all the bullying that I wasn't the one stuck in an abusive relationship. I went silent. She told me how much the guy fantasized about being with me because of my weight loss in the early stages of their relationship before I left, and how he's now 'forgotten about me' after I gained the weight. I told her that's not my problem. We finished the discussion with an argument but I shouted something along the lines of, 'I know you hate me, but I can't bear to see you like this!' and she shot back that this is exactly how I want to see her after what she did to me.

I don't know to what to think or do. AITA? And if I am or am not, what can I do?",1,1736821158.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I’ve been looking into coffee options that test for mold and mycotoxins, and I know of a few companies like Kion and LifeBoost. However, I’m wondering if anyone here has recommendations for other brands that might be a bit more cost-effective.

1i0vhf3,https://i.redd.it/pahge9mccvce1.jpeg,Starved ,"Spartan was rescued in 2018. He came from a kill shelter in Texas and was very malnourished and starved. I worked really hard the first year to get him to feel better about food. I know once starved always starved but he gained weight and was healthy again and isn’t food aggressive at anything of those sorts. He never misses a meal though. 

We recently moved to TX and had to board him for a week. It looks like they didn’t feed him at all when he was there. Visibly looks skinnier. A lot skinnier. 

He is now eating everything he can get his eyes on… ramen, a cup of Andes mints with their wrappers, two bags of dog treats, paper coffee cup, puppy chow, Pedialyte powder, etc. that he has just nabbed when we weren’t looking. He is always very ashamed of himself and puts himself in time out until he feels like he was in time out long enough.

During that time, a Christmas episode of our favorite animated YouTube series was released, and it ended with a very sweet scene of two of the main characters slow dancing on a balcony. 

We watched the episode separately and talked about it when he got back, but ever since I saw the episode I wanted to slow dance to the song with my partner.

Well today, one of my friends (not the one who’s house we were at, but a 4th person) let us know that he wasn’t caught up on the show so we decided to watch from where he last left off. The Christmas episode ended up being one of the episodes we watched, and I told my partner I wanted to slow dance to the song when it started to play.

He asked me “what’s stopping you?” So I got up and started pushing the coffee table to the side and playfully yelled “out of the way, I need to be gay!”

Me and my partner slow danced kind of awkwardly. It wasn’t as graceful as in the show, but it was perfect to me. At one point, I turned around and saw that my friend (the one who invited us) was recording us while the other was silently cheering and making a heart with his hands.

Once the song ended, me and my partner kissed and our mutual friend yelled “WOAH, GETTING KINDA FREAKY!!!” And we all broke into giggles before me and my partner had to start getting ready.

I am looking at a “like new” Bullet R1 V2. Less than two years old. Seller is asking $2900. I am new to roasting but looking to buy a machine I can grow into. 

Am I foolish to spend $2900 on a used machine when I could buy new for $3500 plus tax and shipping? Warranty is non-transferable so even though it’s within the warranty period I would be w/o warranty coverage. 

I see a lot of good things on here about the R1. I also see there’s a bit of a learning curve, which excites me. I appreciate an opportunity to get to know a machine. This is a hobby venture for me but I’ve been known to suffer from GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome). I love gear and equipment as much as I love coffee. 

My wife and I have experience selling on Etsy in the home and gift sector so it could potentially carry over into low volume online sales and farmers markets.

tl;dr

meet a girl over text, want to ask her out, have no way of seeing her in person. Is asking over text dumb and lame?

I’m in college and trying to meet new people, the thing is my major is pretty tightly knit with a lot of people I’m already great friends with. All my classes are in one or two buildings and we rarely if ever collab with other majors.   
ive been able to meet people at clubs and events and such, but some I just meet online, yknow the whole “here’s who’s going to your school and is also your age“ instagram page.

thats where my question comes in, ive been talking to this girl for a few days over text, we both go to the same college but ive never met her in person. And yup she’s not in my major so my chances of an ‘accidental meeting’ are low To zero. 

i want to ask her out soon but the only way I’m able to do it is over text. Is that lame? Would it make me seem unappealing or whatever?

 I was going to say this after continuing our conversation. “Actually it’s really fun talking to you, would you like to grab a coffee sometime soon to chat more?”

is that good or not? I’m probably overthinking, but advice would be welcome. Thanks!",1,1736820491.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I found out Friday and picked up the things Saturday as I was informed semi late. I have weird working schedules so I alternate between day and night shift every two weeks so it’s hard for me to keep consistent in terms of taking my blood sugar as I’m currently sleeping most of the day for overnights. 

I was told by my doctor to keep eating like I am but in moderation until I see the nutritionist about either a diet or insulin but I’ve cut back severely on things. I had a bow of cereal and it put me up to 230 so I threw out all my cereal and started to opt for bananas and other fruits. 

I accidentally drank a not sugar-free coffee when leaving for work as I was half asleep making it and grabbed my boyfriend’s creamer. ( They’re the same but mine is the sugar free kind ) so I assume my blood sugar is gonna be high this next test. 

It seems like I can get it low but then the next time it’s high.

The last time I poke myself, I’m not sure why it was high…? I didn’t have anything with sugar that I know of? It was chicken, zevia soda & that’s entirely sugar free. Maybe the banana I ate spiked it? 

Until I see my doctor for the consult, I’m just not sure what to do. Any advice would be welcome, I feel horrible about the coffee. It didn’t even occur to me since I was driving while sipping it that it tasted too sweet.

Went to the doctor earlier last year, they gave the common advice for constipation (less coffee/citrus, more veggies etc.) But I've never had issues with my diet and I always eat healthy and eat a lot of vegetables Fast forward a few months later I've cut out bread, exercised more, included veggies in every meal, cut out coffee, but the constipation is still there.

 I also stopped feeling hungry in the morning and lost my appetite completely. I felt gassy and bloated 24/7 and had constant stomach aches. I got an abdominal scan and the doctor said I had incredibly severe constipation and I had to use the enema to help and she said that it'll all be solved if I used the enema. I did, multiple times, and the problem has not improved in the slightest.

 And it got worse, I now lack appetite all day and have the worst stomach aches ever and my bowel movements are every 3 days. I never feel hungry and I get so full easily and feel like im going to throw up whenever I eat a normal amount but my stomach hurts in the morning when I'm hungry. And then it hurts more when I'm not hungry or full and it just hurts ALL the time and I feel gassy and bloated and full all the time and it's such a horrible feeling. 

My diet is full of fiber and I exercise regularly and I drink a LOT of water and I don't drink coffee. I've lost enough weight to get back on my natural period. I've tried laxatives, prunes, prune juice, pretty much everything in the market but it's like my stomach is immune. Laxatives don't even work anymore. I feel like Id lose soooo much weight if I could have normal and comfortable bowel movements I don't even know what's wrong with me :(",1,1736819921.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I just wanted to discuss this thought I’ve been having for the longest time about who Zayne reminds me of IRL. Dori Sakurada is my favourite Japanese actor and he once played in the drama called Coffee and Vanilla and I swear the resemblance is uncanny, don’t you agree. Kinda like Sylus and Ric ky from ZB1. 

The character of Dori in this drama kinda resembles a little bit Zayne as well. I recommend watching it but it’s very very cheesy and and a little spicy! 
What do you think, or do you know better options for Zayne? Or any of the LADS boys!

role: raphael may have a bunch of jobs, but his main specialty is medicine and healing. hes in charge of overseeing medical procedures of any and all types to ensure that they go according to plan. that being said, some of the other jobs he has forced upon himself include but are not limited to:  
\-guiding travelers  
\-protecting sleeping mortals from nightmares  
\-overseeing shepherds  
\-guiding lovers to find each other  
\-and also watching over blind people

personality: despite the high stakes of some of his jobs, raphael is always upbeat, cheerful, and full of energy. he gets uncomfortable whenever he has too much free time, and is always excited to get a new assignment, and he hates when you waste his time. he also has an affinity for practical jokes and comedy, and this combined with them working in similar departments have led him and barachiel have become very close friends.

powers: raphaels healing powers are a force to be reckoned with. give him enough time and he can heal quite literally any wound or illness, from a common cold to a severed leg. granted, medical practice takes time, and while he can fix injuries MUCH faster than just letting the body repair itself, it will still take him a few hours for more serious afflictions.

Hi, I’m Joey, graduated college in 2021. Working part-time and planning to go back to college. On and off schedule on going to the gym (depending on if it’s too cold or storming outside) but I do enjoying heading out to go try a new restaurant or a new store with a new variety of energy drink or sparkling water that I havent tried yet or a boba place thats cheap but better than the chains all over the places now. I spend a lot of time online and on games (I quit moba addiction/most pvp games). I’m really passionate about video editing as some content creators are my top role models due to that. Still a beginner but I hope to use my skills to do bigger projects one day. Current things I like to do is watch seasonal anime/Youtube/vtube, read webtoons/manga/novels and play gacha games (f2p) when I’m not working or studying, ill lean into some J or K dramas but my schedule doesn’t allow me to binge watch them anymore then what I used to do. I’m a huge coffee lover, the type that just casually has an abnormal 3-4 cups not just for the caffeine itself or the huge amount of creamer along with it. I also listen to podcasts that attribute to my yapping in tangents of different topics and then asking “howd we get to this topic” (lol). Besides those things I like, I do tend to try new things, as such now I’m really into Warhammer 40k Lore and the space marine games.

Like most men posting here, I have had my fill of online dating apps, and would like to try something a little slower where we can get to know each other over time.

About me? Let's see....I am coming up to the final 18 months of my PhD in computer science, and will be open to relocating almost anywhere on earth, after July next year.   
  
Apart from maths and code, I enjoy classical and jazz music, science fiction and kung-fu entertainment (novels, comics, anime, or movies) and catching up with my dear friends either in person over coffee or a meal, or online over voice chat, or the occasional video game.

I sadly have some rusted-on opinions and quirks that may be deal breakers, so I will list them here to save us both some time:  
\* I'm a cleanskin in every sense of the word.  
\* I am a minimal drinker, and 420 *unfriendly* \- along with all non-prescribed drugs.

\* I don't drive due to medical reasons, which hasn't been a big issue for me in life so far, but I can understand while people may be concerned by this.  
\* I am a tolerant, but committed, Atheist. I absolutely can respect your religion, and will not make any comments in private or public disparaging it, but please don't ask me to live my life, by your chosen deity's rules.

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again.

“YEEHEE! YAAHAA!! CRUSH CRASH CRUUUUSH!”

As Muuru vaulted across furniture and into the dining room, the swelling tide of Wheelz surged behind him, a choir of screaming and chittering as they swarmed across the house. A grin plastered beneath his angler mask, Muuru flipped, vaulted, darted all around, a cyclone of wind whipping all around him. Lucil remained in hot pursuit, smashing through「That Home」 as it assembled itself, a fury in her eyes. 

With the flick of a card, she vaulted over the jeering beasts, alighting in front of the boy as Around The World flung a couch towards him. Narrowly he darted back, but even as Lucil spread her network of woodchips, flickering across the space, across *her nest,* before lunging at him…he didn’t retaliate. What kind of Host would harm a Guest?

Instead, with a sweep of his Dinner Bell, his horned hat flew off, resting perfectly atop a sideways coat rack–Lucil barely caught a glimpse of a fish-like mask before it grew across face. For a moment, it felt like the Lakeside Village, a change upon her, but she knew this was a false recollection. That place would not accept her. Her only home would be the one she carved into this place by force.

With a snarl, she pounced towards Muuru, eyes gleaming- before the boy leapt away, dancing across the blooming furniture, letting nothing guide him but his heart. Though she tried to follow him through the chaos, the 「Home」itself conspired against her, its shifting dimensions displacing her network. Jeering「Wheelz」shredded against her skin, her own debris flung against her by the wind. Finally, her frustrations mounting, she leapt off the path, towards the closet. She would smother this little beast like the rat he was, beat him into submission, finally assert control over this place, over *something,* for once in her miserable, half-formed existence-

The jaws of the mask opened. “YOU’RE LIKE JOHN WICK IN THAT SONIC MOVIE. LET’S TURN YA INTO JIM CARREY!”

The next thing Lucil felt was the floor shifting beneath her, and a pile of furnishings smashing into her back.

…
Dusting himself off, Muuru walked towards the pile of drawers and cushions without a moment’s hesitation.

“I think… you need to start having fun again, unless you wanna go stir-crazy in a musty ‘ole house, trying to become something that you’re not when you’re already a super~cool monster.”
Skipping light over his feet across the storm of sliding objects beneath Muuru slung his hands through his pockets, a vigil eye kept over Lucil’s form. The fight may have been taken out of her, but he knew better than to under-estimate a wounded beast. Monsters more than any other deserve that kind of respect.

“It’s a shame! You keep talking about moving forward but here I am moving when you’re no~ot! Your left hand isn’t even that bad! So how when I’m done teaching this house’s mom manners…”

A cartwheel sent him flipping to his feet atop the precipice of a fallen pillar,

“…I teach you how to turn away from the past, and walk towards the future?”
Hand extended, he lowered down to a crouch to offer it to her. She would have to cross the distance, but it was there.

“Cause I could use a monster, and you could use a city~!”’

Lucil considered the hand for a moment. To reach out and accept this would be to compromise herself–and yet, she didn’t know which ‘self’ she would be compromising. She thought back to the 「Wheelz」 screeching across the ground, to the mask that had adorned her face, to the flickers of that figure with the cowhead…and then looked beyond them all, to their Host himself, a wild child who claimed himself to be grander and more welcoming than any Home. 

Monster and human both.

Already, her hand was reaching towards him. With a creaking hiss, Steric’s transfigured arm cracked and fell away, revealing what they both knew had always lay beneath. Melted, pulsing wire, burning copper filaments blanketed in insulation.

It was always her. The self that existed before the fairytale. The self that endured. An inescapable sense of being.

***[But it is a Space that can Be Shaped.]**

Floors groaned and walls shuddered as Muuru took her hand, assembling the deep and dusty language of 「To Build A Home」.

**[I have watched you scuttle in My Walls. Creation is as Fluid as Water. I know that you can Build upon Your Foundations.]**

“...Maybe,” Lucil sighed, watching the broken beams snap themselves into shape. “If I could have your power-”

At this, Muuru shook her hand vigorously with a laugh. “You can have miiiine~! Both of you!” With his free hand, he gestured to That Home. “The power to be a good Host! It’s somethin’ you seemed to miss, but it’s reeeal simple!”

With a gesture, the Wheelz gathered around him, laughing and playing as they frolicked through the place. As they ate away the mis-proportioned architecture, they revealed The House beneath.

“Y’see, it’s a shaaared space! You share it with whoever else is there, *aaand* you share it with the space too! You both marched in and built Nests juuust for you, and when the others started getting smothered by your corners and your corr~idors, you wouldn’t even look ‘em in the eye!”

With a crack, a portion of ceiling dropped away, letting the sun shine upon the wreckage, revealing all that was to be rebuilt.

“Your kid got that, Homie. It opened its doors to the people who needed it, just like any good Home in any good City should!” With a grin, he turned back to Lucil. “An’ just like good Homes, good Monsters should make cool legends for their City, and inspire all the humans and the Monsters out there too!”

Lucil sighed, her fangs no longer bared. Perhaps it wasn’t so bad to be admired- but only if *she* could decide what she was admired for. If creation was so fluid, maybe she could find a monstrous music of her own.

The floor rumbled. **[Perhaps. But this is my only Offshoot, and the little things inhabiting it did it Harm.]**

“Not all tenants are good ones,” Muuru shrugged. “But that’s between them and The House, you don’t have to get mad at random folks on their behalf~. People who wanna be Hosts keep deci~ding what their guests want without askin’…and it’s stupid every time~!” he laughed. “If you’re so wo~rried…you could support your kid instead of getting mad at its friends!”

There was a long silence. Then, the chime of a doorbell rang, and another, and another, the layered echo of a thousand greetings, before it all fell back to silence. Then the walls of「That Home」wove themselves into The House beneath. A power emanating through its being, the chance to fix itself. 

Muuru laughed, pulling Lucil in as they watched a splash of vibrant paint seal itself between the plasterboard and wallpaper. A message just for them.

*Thanks.*
Then the two were left, standing in a House that was someone else’s. Perhaps they could return, but they would have to look the Willow Wisps in the eyes, and ask for an invitation. Muuru was already planning how to do it–a parkour party in their backyard, attracting brand new tenants.

As Lucil watched him beam up at her, she knew the boy would drag her into it somehow. Maybe that is what it meant to be a monster. 

“Shall we, Lucy?” Muuru gestured out the open door. 

As she nodded, Lucil allowed herself to smirk. The nickname didn’t have a bad ring to it. It sounded like a promise of something all her own.

…

*Within a distant clearing, there grew a little cabin, small, yet cozy.*
*Light shone from within, warm and welcoming.*
*A beacon, to lead the nomads and the wanderers back Home.*

Binay and Apollo were sprawled out across the office floor. They were battered, bruised, bloodied.

“Fffffuck you!” Binay spat as his assailants slowly walked up to the two of them. “You two are toeing a fucking line here!” His face was twisted in indignation. From beside him, Apollo merely clutched her head and moaned in pain as she pushed herself up off the ground.

Dawn spat on the ground. “What’re you gonna do about it, prettyboy?”

In an instant, Binay whipped out his phone—expensive, the casing a thick jet black. “Smile, bitch! You’re on camera! I’m a lot richer, a lot smarter, and a lot better lookin’ then you’ll ever be- if you lay one finger on me the assault charges you’ll get will ruin your life quicker then a fuckin’ terminal illness!”

Dawn stepped forward anyways, Her fists clenched. Angelino put a hand on her shoulder, quickly stopping her. “Don’t. He’s right…”

“...And it won’t be necessary, anyways.” Angelino smirked at Binay.

Dawn looked at him quizzically. Before she could even ask, he just nodded his head behind the two Stand users. Cars were pulling up- government agents. Binay looked back in shock, and Apollo stared at him in confusion.

“Inago pulled some strings back with the Riders. Some of the numbers for Binay’s business ventures weren’t adding up—clear tax fraud. Going in, I knew that we wouldn’t be able to do anything to these two that would stick… But that doesn’t mean they can’t do that for us.”

Too exhausted to fight or to use his stand to slip his way out of trouble, Binay merely cursed as he was read his rights and eventually restrained when he tried to dash.

“You filthy fuckin’ troglodytes!” He screeched at Angelino and Dawn as he was dragged away into a government car. “You have no *idea* how well I treated you! You’ll all end up somebody’s bitch, and when they fucking neuter you freaks you’ll be *begging* for my boot down your thr-”

His ranting was silenced as the door slammed shut.

Unbeknownst to Binay, another little irritant stood off to the side; a camera-phone held steady in the air, connected to a data stream. Binay’s fall, broadcast on the Paparazzi Network for all to see. The stream ended off on that image, of the shut car door, and the image panned over to ‘Her’, sitting behind her desk.

“And so ends Binay Spears… for all his conviction about his dominance, he’ll be brought down in the same way as Al Capone.” She collected her papers, continuing to read from them. “I have a message to give anyone who would find this… unpalatable. He’ll be too busy having his life fall apart around him to bother with anything in his former life.” She gave a reassuring smile to the camera. Word was sure to spread swiftly, after this. Knowledge was a river all its own.

Still, what her audience did with her work was their concern. What mattered was that it was a good show–The Friendly Gossip knew she would sleep well, tonight. She always did.

“And with that, from the Paparazzi Network, goodnight.”

…

With a click, Chandra turned the recording off and slung her phone into her pocket, wandering towards the gym as she whistled a tune with a smile. The others would be waiting–they were long overdue for a *celebration.*

---

The three Stand users merely watched as they drove away, eager to process Binay and place him before a proper court of law. Apollo, hoping no eyes were on her, tried to make a mad dash away before-

“Don’t think you’re off the hook, dipshit!”  Dawn swept Apollo’s legs before holding the doctor down with her boot.


Apollo trembled a little. “B-But it’s like you said—you can’t do anything to me that’d stick! No reason not to just let me go, r-right~?” She sputtered, trying her best to seem friendly and reasonable.

Dawn paid this no mind. “I know what you’re thinking. ‘But I know how she thinks, I know what she fears! I saw her go wild!’” The fire in Dawn’s eyes burned not with blinding flames, but ones of clarity. “You’re right, I am a beast. I’ll never be the same after all that shit growing up. But you’re soft, *Eris.* You only know how to be scary when you’re playing it safe. But people like me can be scary no matter how much shit we’re in.”

She leaned in, boot applying just a touch more pressure. “That’s why you were afraid the second you saw me,” Dawn stated as a cold, venomous, matter of fact. “You realized you made a big mistake stopping the coin and the virus from killing me.”

Apollo looked to Angelino, who was just walking away, hands in his pockets. “Y-You can’t let her kill me! That’s against everything you stand for, everything you-”

Angelino just spoke over her. “Don’t do anything permanent or excessive and it’s none of my business. I’m certain she’s earned everything past that.”

As he continued off, Apollo looked back to Dawn who loomed over her, cracking her knuckles. “I went wild out there to *indulge,”* Dawn grinned. “You and your fancy fuckin’ degree should know it’s not healthy to repress yourself. I did it to make my revenge *fun.* You know people and I know animals; fun and play are important to health and development and shit.”

“I’ll pay you if you let me go; thousands, t-tens of thousands!”

“Uh-uh-uh.” Dawn responded. She looked down at the doctor, her smile electrified with a violent malice. “I’ll tell you what I tell idiots in the park: *don’t fuck with wild animals.* This one’s for Maya.”

…

Angelino looked back when he heard the first crack of a fist against flesh. He had already cleared a few blocks, but just shook his head and moved on. He’d be sure to occasionally check in on Eris during her extended stay at Showtek, make sure no leftovers of the Suite tried to recruit her or have her assassinated to tie up loose ends—but until then…

He breathed out. 

He needed some well deserved rest.

**Scenario: Marvin’s Unbelievable Gallery of Wayward Reverie, Reshmerasta — 8:37PM**

The jingle of the museum’s entrance rang out as a purple figure stepped through the door. The morning was quiet, with the only sound coming from the foyer being Mrs. Mayura, turned backwards at the reception desk while shuffling a few boxes around the back shelves. She paid no mind to the visitor, only giving a solemn nod. The Stand understood, nodding in kind as she made her way into the Gallery proper. However, before she could take another step, she froze at the sudden shrill echoing down the halls.

“MARKOV!” whined a scattered Paranoia, racing towards the Stand with her glitchy arms outstretched and her digital accessories all smeared. “W-where have you been?! I’ve been worried sick. You wouldn’t want a girl to worry, would you?”

Markov patted the virus on her head, even if she couldn’t even ruffle a few pixels. “Ofcoursenot, you-are a *dear* friend. I have been trying-to convince Rasna to acquire a *cellphone* so you can come to visitmoreoften, but my attempts have been all but *fruitless*.”

Paranoia’s face flashed an ugly frown at the mention of that name, but swiftly reverted back to a blubbering mess. “Oh, but I’ve been soooo lonely since you’ve separated with your coin. Who else am I to pass the time with during the long, restless nights in the Gallery?”

“So what am I? Chopped liver?” A voice chimed up from behind the two. Markov turned to face Roxanne, who had her wooden hands bent against her waist, looking for an ounce of remorse on Paranoia’s face. A fruitless endeavor. Another head popped in with a grin, revealing the Gallery’s local comedian. “It’s good to see you, Markov. How’s part-time treating you?”

From a distant corner of the room, Ruby flashed a stilted smile at the Stand, before returning to her usual dusting. 

The energy of the building began to liven up a bit more as the Gallery staff put their morning duties aside for a moment to catch up with what felt like an old friend. Or perhaps, someone they had finally been able to meet for the first time. Carol and Paranoia shared a few stories around the room, filling Markov in on the hijinks she had been absent for. Roxanne interjected every now and again to make sure they got the details right, only for Carol to reassure everyone that she had all the facts completely straight, no bullshit.

However, the chatter would soon find a lull as the clunky heels of Ms. Marvin made themselves present in the room, catching Carol mid-joke. 

The room fell quiet as the owner of the establishment crossed her arms. “Yes, yes, I know it’s *very* exciting that our own Markov has returned to us, but it would be wise to mind the time. We open in 10, on the dot!”

“Speaking of,” Marvin turned to face the floating figure, a wide, cheesy smile plastered onto her face. “You’ll be working the floors today since your crowd-attracting coin is no longer a part of our collection. We’ll need to keep the mystery alive! Oooh, maybe we can convince the public that the museum itself is haunted. And, and maybe you could-”

“Would you give it a rest? She’s an employee proper,” chimed in the Gallery’s local lawyer. Brighid’s tired, cold eyes met her employer’s, who responded in kind with a chilling flash of energy. “Any of Rākin’s many Stand Users would be able to see her, not to mention those who could see her nonetheless.”

“But all we need is one!” Marvin sang. “One person claiming to have seen a spooky apparition roaming the halls of the Gallery. After that, we’ll have people coming in droves to prove the existence of the spectre! We might even have a few daring ghost hunters breaking in at night to inspect the rumors for themselves. How thrilling!”

“Yeah… I really don’t like the sound of that,” Brighid grimaced. But before she could get in another word, her boss had vanished away, scheming quietly to herself in some other corner of the museum. 

Brighid glanced back over to Markov, shaking her head with a casual chuckle. “I guess some things don’t change.”

Markov nodded, taking stock of the place. Her coworkers were already shuffling back to their duties, getting ready for another day of cheap thrills and dubious intrigue. And yet, something was amiss, unfamiliar. Among the bright atmosphere of the Gallery and its tenants, there were pockets of silence where absence could be felt more clearly. The circumstances that linked these women to one another have twisted, transformed over the course of an eventful, destructive year. It’s taken time for some to find their footing again. For others, it’s shown them new opportunities, purpose. Markov studied Brighid for a few moments before crossing her arms.

“…And yet, some things certainly have.”

Another jingle rang out from the foyer, with little steps full of energy following directly after. 

“Din, slow down!” a mousy voice squeaked. “Y-you might knock something over.”

A small kid ran straight into the museum, earning a nasty look from Mrs. Mayura. Rishi gave a meek smile as he slinked into the Gallery after her little friend. Din found himself bouncing from each exhibit to the next, his eyes aglow in wonder at all this cool stuff. Paranoia’s glum form perked up at the kid’s arrival, giving a friendly wave over to him and Rishi, before rushing off to join him. The rest of the staff scattered in turn, manning their positions.

All the while, Markov laughed in turn, before gazing at the gleaming wooden doors as they opened to the public, heralding a new, exciting day.

---

**Scenario: Mount Parapollah — 11:37AM**

Elsewhere, a lone woman sat atop one of the lower cliff sides. Her legs dangled off the edge as she stared down at the old flip-phone in her hand. Today was the day Markov was set to come back to the Gallery after she had gained her freedom from ｢The Matte Money｣. Lucil couldn’t help but grit her teeth. Sure, she was glad that Markov had found a happy ending, but she *still* couldn’t bring herself to be in the same room as her. It confounded her why Markov would waste such freedom on a woman like Marvin, but that was no concern of hers. And while she harbored no ill will towards the rest of the Gallery’s staff, she had her own sights set on something else.

Something more.

She flipped the phone open, navigating its menus until she settled on a certain contact. *‘Call*. Lucil drummed her fingers as the ringing went on. She had hoped it was because of the spotty reception. After an agonizing moment, a click. She picked up.

“Oh, hello. Yes, you already know who this is. Look, don’t hang up, I’m just calling to let you know that-”

The woman’s voice cut out. She knew the words that were about to come out, but they stopped right in the middle of her throat. She swallowed them back down and tried again.

“-listen. What I did was uncalled for. And you have every right to be mad. Now, I don’t think you can blame me for- Alright, alright. I get it. The point is, you get to be Lucil Caravan, too. I’ve got my own life to live, and so do you. But mine’s going to be 100% better than yours. Sorry, not sorry!”

With that, Lucil clapped the phone shut, a wide grin on her face. She had faced many trials to get here, and if she was to carve out her place among humanity, there were plenty more to come. But she couldn’t help but wear a cocky grin. After all, she too was capable of every bit of greatness as Lucil, and more. Her life stretched out in front of her like the Brahmaputra snaked to the horizon- and she just couldn’t *wait* to get started.

“One black coffee, please. Medium.” 

By this point, Maya’s order had become routine. She knew what she wanted, and by this point, the entire staff of Ko Ko Korina Coffee House knew it as well. But she ordered it each and every time, refusing to let the staff assume her next order would fit that pattern, even when it did.

“And one masala chai latte, please,” Minali volunteered from behind her. It was always tea with her, though rarely the same kind. This too was routine; the two of them had kept up these coffee dates ever since Maya stumbled into Thousand Suns after her encounter with Dr. Apollo, and they were happy to return after the Doctor’s defeat. 

“Oh,” Minali added, “and I’ll be paying.”

Maya raised a brow. “You paid the last time.”

“I know, but I’m about to get my public servant paychecks. The least I can do is treat the woman who gave me the idea!”

Maya considered this, and then relented. “I doubt there’s any pay difference between a City Planner and a Councillor. Next time, I’ll pick up the tab.” 

To this, Minali laughed. “Sure, sure.”

With their orders in hand, the two exited out into the city streets. The warmth beneath the paper cups was the only thing staving off that Winter chill, and with a long, synchronous sip, the two took that warmth within themselves before they carried on. A comfortable silence followed them, before Maya began again.

“I’ll need your help with some meetings I’ve arranged with village representatives in the Northern Floodplains. Migration from Rākin has been putting a lot of social and economic strain on those areas, and it only got worse after the Middleman debacle. I need to make sure that we don’t narrow our focus to Rākinnagarh and completely lose sight of them. Those voices *must* be heard.”

Minali nodded along, sighing as she felt the January sun settle across her skin. A new year had rolled across the region, and many swore it would be better than the last. But that would require a lot of work. There would be many mistakes to be amended, old and new.

“For sure.”

“Port Konwar too, you wouldn’t believe how much politicking those shipping companies are tied in. Provincial, national, international–we need some way of showing those workers that at least the city is on their side.”

“Takanaka’s on economics, right?” Minali inquired. “I’m sure she’d be open to talk with you about that.”

Maya hummed along, rolling out her shoulders, gently running a hand along her upper leg. “I’ve already arranged it–with Gotam too. The man’s got great insight, but he’s already butting heads. I know it’s a change of pace for him–for all of us. But if we figure out how to make this council better, we can really start to make a difference.”

But Minali did not respond, as her gaze was locked onto an approaching figure. As Maya turned, she watched Dawn skid to a halt in front of them with her arms full of flowers and her lungs emptied of air. She took a look between the two women, trying to catch her breath, before Maya smiled and extended the coffee in her other hand. 

Dawn immediately brightened, grabbing it and taking a sip. “Shit, thanks Maya,” she sighed, readjusting her bouquets.

“Are those from Konan?” Maya inquired.

“Yeah,” Dawn nodded. “He insisted that I swing by the shop so he could give me a congratulatory gift.”

“For the position, or for beating up Apollo?” Minali chimed in.

“Both,” grinned Dawn.

“How has he been keeping up?” asked Maya, as she gestured for the three of them to continue walking, stepping aside to let people move past.

“He’s good, finally put some meat on his bones. Busy though–he barely managed to find room in his schedule. Nova’s been a good employee though, it helped make these,” she shook the bouquets.

“Nova?” Minali asked.

“You remember the little plant creature that was in your studio? It finally figured out a name.”

To this, Minali beamed with pride. Dawn shot a smirk back, mirroring the feeling. Hers was a ragtag group to be sure, but together they had moved mountains, even as they conserved them. 

Even their overseer, whose relationship with Dawn and her group of ‘strange little spirit mediums’ was always rocky, had admitted that they were doing a great job. A newsletter, a booming camping goods store, and a push towards local governance had cemented their success.

Conversation kept flowing gently between the three of them, broken only by some friendly exchanges with passing strangers, and a text from DD, who had finally gotten off her shift from the aforementioned store. 

[DD heard you t0tez got that creepo doc! Gratz! GG and GL at work!!! >w<]

Dawn chuckled to herself, leaning in to show the text to Maya, and as she joked about the cat finally pulling herself away from Runescape long enough to message them, she gently brushed against the woman’s arm. For a moment, the touch lingered, as did the gaze shared between them. 
It had taken a lot of sleepless nights to reach this morning. There would surely be more in the future. But now, in this moment, they were another step closer to the creation and the conservation of their dream. So that the act of preservation might be shared like a tapestry instead of set like a trap.

At last, at the end of their trail, and the bottom of their coffee cups, they reached city hall. Maya took a deep breath, feeling *months* of work finally settle into shape, a good foundation for building a m.A.A.d city. She looked to Dawn, watching the woman practically buzz with anticipation.

“Finally, we made it,” Dawn exhaled.

“To the first step, at least,” Maya concluded.

“The climb continues, then?” Dawn’s hand found Maya’s, their eyes trailing up the bricks of the administrative building, before rising further, to the landmark standing valiantly behind it.

At last, Maya allowed herself to smile.

“It does…but we’re well versed at scaling mountains.”

---

In two distant corners of Rākinnagarh, two people are staring at that mountain: A Shield that Cuts, and the Host of a City. 

It is their Knowledge and their Power which have let them bury a Metropolis, and their Passion which have let them begin to build back a City for the Unloved. 

All these things have led them along their paths, and soon, that same Crossroad will lead them to each other…

To grow together in this Garden of Vermillion.

1i0us2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i0us2o/storytime_the_date_that_never_happened/,Storytime: the date that never happened ,"Warning: this story might be boring to some people 

So, I'm 26 (M) and I've never been on a date. I've  asked girls out but it's I get rejected each time. Dating apps don't work foe me either. There was one time I ws so close to going on a date and it lives in my memory.

Here it goes. I work in a lab. With different labs adjacent to me. With no barriers you hear everything going on. For 2 years I would overhear conversations in lab and people didn't realize I was listening. I heard so many conversations of this one group I could write a whole novel about it. One person in particular always had my attention. She was woman my age always talking about herself and others. It was really interesting. I learned where she lived, what she did in college what pet she has, and every other detail about her. Yeah, I know it sounds creepy but I work alone in the lab and generally have no on to talk to. This is entertainment for me. What was funny is that for the first year I didn't know how she looked like because usually go by that area. I do not have a reason to interact with that group so it was no necessary. Still, I'm intrigued by her personality and her essence. One day, I'm by computer. It's close to 5 or 6 pm. The girl walks by my bay to ask me a question. Apparently some dumbass in her group left a snack wrap on the bench. For safety reasons you're not supposed to food waste around (let alone eat in lab). She,asked me who it was. I said it was one of the guys in the group. I knew who it was but didn't know his name. She was wearing a face mask but I could see her eyes. She is beautiful. Even if the mask covers her face. It struck a cord in me.

Months passed. I decided that I was going to make rapport with her. I didn't feel comfortable asking her out immediately. I wanted to get acquainted first. So, I ask what she studied in college and if she applied to medical school (I heard her once say something about applying to medical school). This is a great entry to talk to her as I also want to go to medical school. I got her number so I can ask her questions about applying to medical school or taking the MCAT.

Next, I ask if she wants to hangout sometime and she shows interest. During these months I would often try to have small talk with her. The highlight of my day was her waving to me as I pass her through the hallway. I would ask to hangout on 2 occasions over text. Each time she said that she was busy or didn't see my text. I decided to ask her one last time. We agreed to get coffee on a Friday. Okay, I said earlier it was a date but really I was asking her for a platonic hangout. Whatever. I had a crush on her so it felt like a would be date. I was excited. For the first time, a girl agreed to meet with me one on one. This was not school or work related. It was almost like a date. I was so stressed out. In mind, I'm thinking ""what are we going to talk about?"" and ""what jokes should I make?"" The day comes. I ask to reconfirm if we are still meeting up. She says yes. A couple hours later she says that some plans came up the last minute and to reschedule. She canceled. I understood ad asked what other day would work. She never responded. 

Well, that was that. I continued to greet in the hallway and that's it. She eventually switched jobs so I never saw her again. I've moved on as well. However, sometimes I think back on this. For a moment I had a chance. Some people might say this was a failure bit I viewed as a success. This was the closest I've ever been on a date. ",2,1736818868.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",1,1736818752.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I'm 24 M 5'11 170 lbs

No previous medical history. Take zero medications.

Been having on and off digestive issues for about 6 months but recently came back and is concerning me, however I can't afford health insurance right now.

Symptoms:
Pretty persistent stomach discomfort (moderate / mild) in upper or whole intestine area followed by diarrhea. 

If I press on my stomach it feels almost tense and... achy?

It seems to go in cycles of diarrhea > bloating > slight constipation > perfect stool / bowel movement for one day > then back to square one all over a span of a couple weeks. This time though I'm getting persistent abdominal discomfort almost all day and can hear my stomach / intestines rumbling and moving gas etc. 

I've not had a consistent bowel movement in months.

No blood in stool or severe weight loss. I have lost a little weight but I think it's because I've been having these issues so I'm not eating as much.

My sister does have celiac disease.
No other family history of anything gi related. 

I work on peoples wheelchairs for work and am often exposed to bodily fluids, in and out of nursing homes etc. I'm wondering if I picked something up?

My concern is it's something serious I need checked out but am hesitant to go to the doc and spend money I can't afford to spend.

I like to believe this is my own doing and the most likely issue being my own fault. Just before this all started, I was pretty skinny, maybe 145lbs. I started drinking cheap mass gainer everyday on top of eating anything I wanted just trying to put on some weight. I got up to a out 175 lbs, stopped the mass gainer, and that's about when this started happening. 

This was 6 months ago though, could I have messed up my gut and it's still giving me issues? 

I also use nicotine puches and drink coffee every morning as my breakfast (terrible I know) 

On top of dealing with 2 disabled parents so I'm extremely stressed. 

I feel like it's lifestyle factors causing these issues, and I need to change my habits. Just wanted some opinions on if I should get checked out and if so, what tests would be ideal to start. 

It's really starting to worry me. Thank you for your time

In fact, I was so impressed that I returned my De’Longhi Dinamica Plus because it produced exceptional balance shots and was way smarter and easier to use than the Dielonghi The only initial grind adjustment I made was to grind the beans 2 notches finer by moving the dial towards the front of the machine.

I went on vacation for 2 weeks and upon returning, I noticed a sudden change in the taste of my coffee. It had become extremely sour, reminiscent of bad Sour Patch Kids. Despite using the same beans, a medium roast Joe Coffee,.I tried a fresher bag of the same joe coffee beans roasted on December 27, and undrinkable sour.

 I tried experimenting with different beans, but the sour taste persisted. I even tried decaf medium roast on January 6, which was equally sour.

I’ve tried adjusting the grind settings to the point where I was just one notch away from the finest settings, but the coffee remains undrinkable. I’m beginning to suspect that my machine may be defective. However, I find it puzzling that changing the grinder settings doesn’t seem to have any effect on the taste.

I’ve already removed the brew unit and rinsed it thoroughly. I’m considering performing a factory reset, but I’m not sure if that’s the right course of action. Perhaps the machine is indeed defective. It’s frustrating because it was producing well-balanced and perfect shots for an entire month..

I’m curious to know what grind settings are commonly used for the KF8 coffee maker. Could someone please share their experience?",1,1736818431.0,superautomatic,5,1.0,False

She was def giving me the eyes on the last one, and she talked 90 percent of the time at rapid pace, so it was pretty easy. We both have acknowledged we're socially awkward people, but she is definitely more boisterous and outgoing it seems. 

We're planning on eating at a decent restaurant after work Friday. My questions:

1) How long should a date like this last? 45min coffee date seemed to go great btw.

2) Should I offer to pay? 

3) What do you do after? We both go to our homes, or do I offer to take her on a walk or something?

4) Should I offer a side-hug? Hold hands?

I ask these questions because I started dating largely just last year. I have a hard time with social cues, touch, and just understanding people in general. This woman seems pretty neat. She's way smarter, has a career like I do, and is self-sufficient.

I am applying for Equity Research roles and struggling a bit with the process. My goal is to land some type of investment analyst role in any sector of public equities, regardless of it being on the sell-side or buy-side. My background is as follows:

* Non-target undergraduate degree in business; GPA = 3.73
* No clubs/extracurriculars. I slacked my first two years of college, and then was borderline homeless from Junior year to Senior year. Worked a retail/ seafood job to support myself while couch surfing/studying. Ever since I dug myself out of that hole, I've been grinding/focused.
* I am currently employed as a data analyst covering the financial performance of the legal industry (largest law firms in world). I have been doing this for the past 2.5 years post graduation.
   * this role involves a substantial amount of writing, analysis, excel, python, sql, presenting
   * I provide consulting services and thought leadership in this niche
   * A lot of my work is publicly available so I've linked some of it to my resume (the blue highlighted text). I've also linked my personal github page to my resume as a have a portfolio of programming projects that demonstrate these skills.
* I have limited modeling experience through the BIWS program, and my own project I completed on LOW recently (can provide upon request)
* I have passed the CFA L1 exam (last May)
* I do not have a strong network of people in this field, outside of the people I added from my school (that I never spoke to in person). Networking is a weak point.
* My experience prior to my current role isn't very relevant: TA at university, inventory manager at a seafood restaurant.

Application status:

* I have applied to about 25 firms for entry level equity research roles
* Thus far, I have been formally rejected by 2, and am in the interview process with 1 (next round is Wednesday) MM IB. The rest, I haven't heard back from.
* My typical application is: resume (see attached), no cover letter (instead I insert my work sample writeup), and then for some roles I reach out to the sector analyst and send an application follow up email that briefly touches on who I am, why I'm reaching out, includes a sample of my work (pdf + model) and asks to set up a coffee chat.
   * No analyst has replied to my email reach out, so I'm thinking this is a bad approach.

My request:

* Could you please review my resume and provide feedback? Do not hesitate to be harsh - I have thick skin. Also, please disregard the different line thickness under the ""Work Sample"" section, it is formatted correctly in my actual resume.
* For networking:
   * would you advise reaching out on LinkedIn, or sending cold emails (with/without work sample)?
   * Is it a bad strategy to network with people at firms I have already applied for?
   * Should my approach to networking be based on jobs that are available or should it be more focused on building out a larger net of contacts?
   * Should I even apply to a higher tier institution before networking a little?

Thank you all for your time, and for any feedback/advice provided.

I pulled shots on other machines, where my usual times corresponded with the standard times, but with my Profitec Go, I end up pulling shots that are well over 35s. I had a bag where my usual shot time was 45s.

I know that taste is king and as long as it tasted good, I don't see a problem either. The coffee nerd in me wants to know why this is though and if others have similar experiences.

If this is a common occurence, I would suspect that it could be the big headroom of the Profitec. Notice how it takes a while to build up 9 bars? I think it is because it just takes a while to fill up the headroom of the machine, which seems to be bigger than in others. For the extraction to really start, the headroom needs to be filled first. That would also explain that the pucks are less dry on average than in other machines (big headroom causes soggy pucks).

Another factor could be also wrong PID offset, but so far my results are still best with very long shot times, instead of shorter with raised temp. I have no device to settle this for sure though.

So I want to ask here about your usual shot times and if you have tried very long shot times on your machine. 40 seconds is rather normal with my Profitec, while on others it is a very rare occurence.",12,1736818021.0,ProfitecGo,19,1.0,False

1i0uesq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i0uesq/i_am_done_with_being_ugly/,I am done with being ugly.,"Yeah, the title means it. After 15 years I am finally tired of being ugly. 

Never in my life have I ever got any kind of compliments, even those polite ones you use to address a strange child. While all of my cousins got doted on their complexion or eyes or lips, all I ever have is a “Hi, here you are, XXX.” I am grateful that my relatives are all sensitive that they never use any kind of insults or offensive sayings, that’s why I can persist for that long a time.

My school life is, to a worse degree. Pretty girls in my class got helped with the lightest paper files they need to bring to teacher office, while I had to carry tables and chairs upstairs while people just stare blankly and pretend to be busy when I’m asking. I never get a present on days like Valentine or Women’s Day, even though it’s some kind of activities mandatory for boys (they got assigned to gift a girl), they just pretend to forget. It’s like four years consecutive so I don’t think I am overthinking. The only reason why I didn’t get called by all those filthy names other not pretty girls (they are even better looking than me) was that I study well and they daren’t offend me to lose the chance of borrowing my notes.

I hit the commercial gym early in middle school, and changed three different facilities because of all terrible attitudes I got from gym bros and girls there. First time a girl shooed me away because my “boar-like face” would ruin her butt selfie, second time a bunch of men intentionally chat out loud of me “won’t even be a 4 even if she’s training”, and third time ignored with a failed bench press while seven men hovered to a hot tiktok girl showing her how to do bicep curls. 

Being the ugly girl in friend circle. Disclaimer, I love my friends, they are amazing girls, but at the same time they are the blunt proof of my disgusting appearance. They never have to park their cars themselves, escorted into the restaurant if it’s raining with the staff umbrella, while I struggle to park mine somewhere afar and rushed in the lobby myself. They got BFs without even having to try - the boys come to them, while I, if lucky, will be put aside and sometimes got to say one or two sentences, and if not, become the invisible woman. (Of course I never have an offer for something as small as a coffee chat from a boy, let alone a date). They easily get a part time job at shop clothes while at the same store the owner rejected me because they need salesperson who look “aesthetically pleasing” (I don’t even look pleasing, amazing, thanks). I am never in consideration for school plays, performances, choirs, etc. because I never look good for a role that needs showing face - “just fill her in the roles of the tree/mouse/backline syncer/…” while they get the leading roles 100% the times.

College is nowhere better. I got invited to parties out of sympathy - they feel bad for asking my friend before recollecting my existence, or only when my friends drag me there. Boys talk to me for info of my friends or persuades me to be the Steve in those dates with my friends so “they won’t feel awkward” (what about me, thank you?) Dates are hopeless, and my dating profiles only got likes if I blur/crop my face, and almost every likes is for hookups. 

I have heard chicken soups of “people love the personality”, “appearance doesn’t last”, etc. It is JUST SYMPATHETIC WORD. None bothers to find out your personality if you are not good looking; how can you find out one’s personality if you dont even look at that person’s face or listen attentively enough? And appearance gave pretty people at least 20 years of joy and privilege; maybe at 60 when everyone start having wrinkles would I be treated differently, but pretty girls would become pretty elderly and old men would honor to pull their wheelchairs instead of mine. Maybe I am surrounded by too many pretty people, or I encounter too many shitty people, but the possibility is too high that it makes me wonder so this is what it is.

I’m just tired of looking disgusting. It is eating me mentally and physically; so I’m saving some more bucks for my total cosmetic surgery fund, because I would rip my whole face off and rebuild it from the ground. And may I still able to thrive till I saved enough. Thank you for reading this whole toxic TED.  ",2,1736817776.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

During these years his mother has not once met me, not even talked to me on the phone etc. At the same time she wants my partner (30m) to visit her every weekend and stay from fri-sun, claiming she needs help with shopping etc. She also wants to cuddle with him in bed during that time, calls him her „strong, handsome man"" and insists that she handles all his doctors appointments (which all are on wednesdays and since it is a 3 hour drive, he has to take the day off & she asks him to stay till Sunday. Like excuse me? How about finding a doctor where you live???) 
She is divorced and around 50 years old, with no sickness. 
Since I told him that these visits over are not okay for me, he immediately switched to going to her place around once a month (still at least the whole weekend) - but does not see, how her behavior ist still strange. Like come on, she could at least meet me for a coffee? Or even talk on the phone? 
But now there is a little one on the way (yay) and I am getting anxious. I know my fiancé wants to visit his mother with our child, sind we live in the city and she lives on the countryside. He wants her to visit us after birth etc. 
But I simply feels uncomfortable by the thought of it: a stranger visiting me immediately after birth? Who still has never talked to me? Who seems weirdly attached to her son? And them later on going to her place, where I am not invited?? 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? How did you handle it? And do i have a finance-problem, since he doesn’t really see, how weird this all is?

1i0ucta,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1i0ucta/my_best_friend_completely_broke_my_heart_its_been/,My best friend completely broke my heart. It's been 9 months.,"Silly title, I don't care. This has broken into so many aspects of my life and I'm STILL thinking about it. I'm so fucking exhausted.

So, for a little background, this actually happened back in May, but it's really been messing me up. I made a vent post similar to this a little while ago that didn't go anywhere because (I assume) it was insanely long, so I'll keep this short. My (20f/nb) friend (20 nb) and I had been friends since freshman year, so almost 7 years when this happened. 

We had been living together in their parents attic, dorm room style, (although we shared a bed for a few months) for about a year. When we first started living together, I had just moved out of my parents house and was completely no contact, I was really messed up. It was a horrible time for me. I got the sense that they were tired of hearing me vent to them and after that, I made a conscious decision to start keeping things to myself. It was literally my new year's resolution last year because I felt like I was bothering them with my issues. 

We had decided to move to a different state together where their older sister lived, and I was like ""hey, you should meet some of my friends from my old school before we leave next year."" ; we hang out with two boys I used to be super close with in late July. TLDR, the boy I dated for a month in seventh grade who used to be my best friend became my boyfriend. He was there for me when I needed him - he was the one who asked me questions and supported me while I repaired the relationship with my parents, even though he went to college a month after we started hanging out. He was just my friend for four months before we started dating, and he was in college for a lot of our relationship, because I took a two year gap until this year.

My friend had sort of been distant since I started liking him, it was weird, but I honestly think our friendship had been rocky for a really long time before that. 

The first instance was after we started dating, I stayed the night at his house for the first time, we had a hangout planned the next day with a friend I hadn't seen in forever at his house, and my friend was invited to meet them. They drove up and we're insanely quiet the whole hangout - I was really uncomfortable because I had felt a weird vibe for a while but this hangout just settled me with the feeling that something was off. I felt both insanely guilty and angry at the same time, which I didn't understand. We get home and they told me they cried all night because I wasn't there, and that I had ""barely looked at them all night"" during the hangout. We had a long talk that didn't really go anywhere, I told them I had a lot on my mind with my family, my new relationship, and the living situation has felt a little tense. I did make an effort to talk to them during the hangout, but there were four other people at the hangout and I couldn't have paid full attention to them even if they were talking at all. I said they seemed distant and annoyed whenever we were together, and if they wanted more from me, I needed them to want to hangout with me too. They accused me of trying to make them do everything, and I said I just wanted them to meet me halfway, but that I would do more. 

fast forward; it just gets worse. I have a panic attack one night before they come back from work, they immediately start asking if I'm mad at them and storm around when I say no. I have a good array of mental issues and one of my biggest problems is that during panic attacks specifically, but just general high stress, I clamp up and can't speak. They start screaming at me. They yell at me and say I always do this. This conversation ended with me just saying I was sorry and they're the only person who can silence me like this. They laughed, even though to me it felt like a bad thing, and said I was the only one who could get them to react like that. Its always felt gross to me. 

Fast forward again, to May... I closed off for a while. I felt like they were getting snippy and upset with me every single day for any reason they could find, and I just figured it was better not to talk back. one day, my boyfriend sleeps over a long with the friend we first hung out with, because we were a group of four. Me and my boyfriend were arguing that night and my friend seems happier than ever, snuggling up to me, holding my hand, listening to me. I miss them so much, I remember this version of them so well and it feels so good to have them back. We have a great night until I pull my boyfriend aside and have a conversation with them; I TLDR the conversation to my best friend and they immediately revert back to being monotone and passive aggressive. I feel like I'm trying to convince them that it's a good thing we talked it out the whole conversation. He ends up staying in my bed and my roommate ops to sleep downstairs (even though I said multiple times he didn't have to sleep in the room with me if they were uncomfortable or it was overwhelming), they look at me, FINALLY, and say, ""It's ALWAYS overwhelming when he comes over."" before storming out. 

The next morning, jump cut, they walk in on a pretty heavy makeout. We had just woken up, I feel like... it happens. I had work and we had to go and they were checking to make sure we were getting ready I guess. Aggressive uncomfortable conversation ensues before they slam the door and leave. I have some s*xual trauma / diagnosed with PTSD from my childhood and PDA has always made me feel disgusting in all ways because of this, like, if I kiss him on the cheek people will just associate it with the sexual part of our relationship I guess. it's an irrational thought process. So I'm really overwhelmed in addition to how they've been acting. I go down to brush my teeth and hear them storm upstairs, so I follow and apologize. they say; ""Okay?"" and then cut me off to say ""I'm getting dressed."" The plan was for the four of us to go to my job, I'll work (coffee shop!) and they'll hangout for a bit and I'll get their orders and make their drinks.  Car situation would've put us alone in a car together and I need downtime before work, so I imply they shouldn't come, which understandably makes them really upset. They scream at me and I just kind of run down the stairs. 

I'm in the bathroom getting ready and I call them in because I feel guilty, apologize again and tell them I know its uncomfortable. They say they weren't upset to begin with and I'm putting words in their mouth, which I know isn't true, but I love them so I just say; ""but if you were, it would be completely understandable."" and they do a wide eyes, tight lipped smile as if to say ""yeah, obviously."" I don't remember most of this convo but it ended with me saying ""and you're allowed to feel that way, but you can't talk to me like this!"" (because they were yelling and accusing me of stuff and I was struggling to understand what they were upset about, since they kept saying they weren't mad, but kept hurting me by saying rude things) And that makes them storm off saying they're ""just trying to talk to me"". I shout up ""You're not trying to talk by yelling and running away from me!"" and they screech, ""FUCK YOU!!!"" They sent me a ten minute read (literally) of texts and I said I couldn't read them until later because I had to work. They asked ""what the fuck was wrong with me"" and why I was responding then. It was just a bunch of stuff about how my relationship is disgusting, we're always crawling all over each other, and most specifically, implied they were screaming at me and it was my fault because I didn't support them enough. They just put me down and said I was a shit friend a bunch. I didn't respond after work because I was so overwhelmed, and later got a ""I think you should move out."" text. They packed everything without letting me help, and kicked me out, but I really wanted to fix things. 

this whole ordeal went on for a while. I really wanted to fix it, but they would never communicate with me except for bringing up things I said no matter how many times I apologized, and trying to talk about other stuff. I eventually told them I wanted to stop talking for a while because I still thought about how they treated me everyday, and I didn't think I'd be able to heal while talking to them until we talked about what happened. They told me I will obviously always see them as a horrible person, and that my view of them is ""both warped and disgusting."", and that I should know them better than that after 6 years. it really hurt because after all the energy they demanded from me about not doing enough, they completely gave up on me. I told them I loved them and cared a lot but they really hurt me, and then blocked them on everything except the one place they blocked me, so they had a means to reach out when they were ready. I came home for winter break and was really hoping they might reach out but they haven't, and in so tired of wishing my best friend of almost seven years gave a shit about me. 

I never wanted either of us to ""be the asshole"", but I just feel so exhausted and like I can't ignore how horribly they treated me for so long. At the same time I want to fix this. I can't reach out anymore, at this point it would be both pathetic and embarrassing to try getting an ounce of sympathy or communication from them. When am I going to get over this when it's been over half a year at this point? I cared about them so much and it feels like they only wanted me when I devoted all my energy to them. 

I know this post is still long. I'm honestly just happy to get it off my chest again. I feel so exhausted. I wish my best friend gave a shit about me, considering how often they used the amount of time we've known each other against me.  ",1,1736817620.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

The Tyrant in Crimson, sits in his throne awaiting for the Catalyst to reach its full power, so he can intertwine the realities and dimensions he loathes so deeply. He hates life because of all of the happiness he could never obtain, he thinks it is better to destroy it. He is bored so he will use the power of the Catalyst to combine all realities together and watch them battle to the death. It is a cruel form of entertainment. Once he is satisfied, he will crush it all.

\-

It’s an average day in Tokyo, Japan and the two best friends Nikushimi and Sekiryu are walking around, bored, looking for something to do. “Hey, Sekiryu, check this out!” Nikushimi yells. “Yeah what’s up?” Sekiryu responds. “Looks like that game you love is getting a big update soon.” Nikushimi says. Sekiryu grins as he says. “Hell yeah,  finally some new content, it’s been forever since the last update.” Nikushimi looks over at Sekiryu, then turns to watch a group of people walk down the crosswalk in front of them. They stop at a small coffee shop to grab something to drink. As the two watch people pass by out the window, Sekiryu pulls out his phone and plays the game Nikushimi mentioned. Nikushimi has always been a people watcher, he likes to judge people in his head and if there is someone who looks strange enough to strike humour to Nikushimi, he points it out to Sekiryu and they joke about it. “Holy shit, that guy’s got a big ass nose don't you think?” Nikushimi says as he taps Sekiryu’s shoulder. “Damn, you’re not lying huh?” says Sekiryu as he looks up and examines the guy passing by. 

\-

“After ages of waiting, the Catalyst has reached the peak of its power.” The Tyrant says with a booming tone. He rises from his throne, conjures his staff and walks over to the machine containing the Catalyst. The Catalyst is a black diamond that shines brightly white, and has the power of the gods. He grabs the diamond and places it atop the staff, it shakes and wobbles but then fixes itself into place. He walks over to the front of his throne and states, “Now it is time for all of existence to consolidate.” He then slams his staff onto the ground, not even a second later the area around him starts to shake.

\-

Suddenly, a loud, thundering sound catches Nikushimi and Sekiryu's attention, they get up, walk to the window and look up in horror and confusion. Little cracks appear as the sky begins to shatter. Nikushimi turns to  Sekiryu and they stare at each other for a moment in awe before Nikushimi stutters “Is this th-the fucking rapture?!” For a moment Sekiryu is too petrified to speak, he manages to get the words “I don’t have a damn clue.” out of his mouth. The cracks get substantially larger until the sky eventually shatters. Thousands of monstrous entities, of all different sizes and appearances, start to plummet from the sky. A massive, lanky, thin entity drops onto a car, crushing it and making the car alarm blare. The creature leaps onto an innocent bystander frozen in fear, tearing their head off in one swipe. Abruptly, the screens on the surrounding buildings go blank, then shine bright white with a star shaped logo appearing. The logo says StarPoint, an organization unheard of by all and known by few. The screen then cuts to an alert that says, “Be aware, reality is unstable. All entities are going to be contained shortly. Take shelter somewhere secluded. You are not safe.” After the broadcast plays for a minute or so, it shuts off. “What the hell is a StarPoint? And what the HELL are these monsters?” Sekiryu yells at Nikushimi. “I don’t know, but all I know is that we need to get the hell out of here! NOW!” Nikushimi yells as he grabs Sekiryu by the arm and runs. As they are running they hear a loud noise, the sound of glass shattering. They look up in horror as they see him, the Tyrant in Crimson, staring down upon them with a smirk of joy and evil.

### Stay Safe and Secure

Your safety is a priority while traveling solo. Here are steps to ensure you feel secure during your journey:

- **Share Your Itinerary:** Keep family or friends informed about your travel plans and whereabouts.
- **Keep Valuables Secure:** Use a money belt and avoid flaunting expensive items. Always keep your passport and important documents in a safe place.
- **Stay Aware:** Trust your instincts. If a situation feels uncomfortable, leave the area. Familiarize yourself with local emergency numbers.

One of the joys of solo travel is the chance to meet new people. Here are ways to connect with locals and fellow travelers:

- **Join Group Tours or Classes:** Engage in activities that interest you, such as cooking classes or guided tours.

- **Utilize Social Media:** Look for local groups on platforms like Facebook, where you can arrange meet-ups with others.

### Embrace Flexibility

Traveling solo allows for spontaneity. Be open to changing plans if something catches your interest:

- **Explore Off the Beaten Path:** Don’t hesitate to stray from your itinerary if a local tells you about an interesting place.
- **Enjoy Me-Time:** Spend a day wandering around, people-watching, or simply enjoying nature at your own pace.
- **Take Photos:** Capture experiences. It’s also a great conversation starter when you meet new people.

### Document Your Experience

Keeping a record of your thoughts and experiences can enhance your travel journey:

- **Journal Daily:** Reflect on your adventures and jot down your experiences. This can help clarify your thoughts and feelings.
- **Create a Travel Blog:** Share your experiences online. It can connect you with like-minded travelers and inspire others to embrace solo travel.
- **Collect Souvenirs:** Whether it's postcards or local crafts, staying tangible reminders of your journey contributes to your story.

### Prioritize Mental Well-Being

Solo travel can sometimes lead to feelings of loneliness. Here are ways to maintain your mental well-being:

- **Practice Mindfulness:** Take moments to breathe and appreciate your surroundings. Meditation can center your thoughts and feelings.
- **Set Daily Intentions:** Before each day, decide what you wish to experience or feel. This can motivate you through your travels.
- **Stay Connected:** Make time for video calls or messages to family and friends to share your journey with loved ones.

Traveling alone can be a transformative experience filled with personal growth and self-discovery. By planning wisely, staying safe, and embracing the journey, you can create lasting memories that will inspire future adventures. So pack your bags and hit the road—an unforgettable solo travel experience awaits!

I'm arriving in Brisbane and I have plans to also visit Noosa/Gold Coast, staying \~2/3 days in each city.

A few questions and points that I would appreciate your inputs if you have visited Brisbane/GC/Noosa in the past:

* I know most people recommend renting a car, but because my time is a bit limited and public transportation (+Greyhound/Uber) seems accessible enough in these places, I don't think the lack of a rental car will disrupt my trip in a significant way. Am I being naive? I also booked tours to see the Leamington NP and around Noosa (outside of Noosa Heads, where I'll be staying) - I believe these are the things that would require a vehicle the most (?). Several issues made me want to NOT rent a car as well, such as the lack of parking in Noosa, not being used to drive on the left and being relatively afraid of being on my own in the wild. I can still change my mind though!
* Are there any must dos/must eats in that region or in Australia in general? (Besides Tim Tams) I saw that coffee culture is huge there, so that's definitely something to experience. Things like meat pies and sausage rolls, places where would I find the best ones?
* I'm not big into partying or amusement parks, so I'm a bit afraid of being bored in GC. I tried finding a good amount of nature activities to keep me busy, however, I'm also aware that the city is quite big (which I like!) and the beaches are also amazing. From what I read, I should avoid Surfer's Paradise and stick to Burleigh Heads/Mermaid Beach, is that correct? And even though I'm not an amusement park person, is there one that you would think it's worth it?
* Lastly, this one is a bit weird and only if anyone has specific recommendations, but I really enjoy reading local authors/listening to local music when I'm abroad. If you have a book or artist in mind from Queensland that I should check out, I would appreciate it.

I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions about Southern Queensland in general! I searched Reddit up and down for recommendations, but apparently not a lot of people go to Brisbane from other countries for vacation. The consensus seems to be that it's a boring (???) place, yet I've been to many ""boring"" cities/countries and found out that they are usually the best spots. 

Thanks!

I got a smart grinder pro with my BDB in a package about 3 years back. I’m looking to upgrade because I just don’t feel as though I’m getting all the flavours out of my espresso. I mainly drink light to medium roast, and only espresso. Not a fan of pour coffee etc.. so no need to change the grind setting much.

I’m also not a huge fan of single dosing, as my wife makes coffees occasionally in single shot, vs my double shot. We also have young kids so weighing out doses constantly seems like a pain. I could be wrong?

I’m located in Australia, and based on the budget I keep looking at the Eureka Specialita 55 I can get for AUD $799 USD $494 equivalent. Initially I liked the look of the Sette 270wi however the loudness is a turnoff, I can already hear my wife and kids complaining haha. 

Any ideas, or is it not even worth upgrading my current grinder?

Thanks all!

1i0u4ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_partners/comments/1i0u4ea/she_broke_up_with_me_because_shes_hurting/,She broke up with me because she’s hurting,"I met my ex back in July and we started going out. We made things official in September but things came to an end last Saturday. I felt like I could be myself around her and I just felt happy and supported. A little into dating, she told me she felt like I wasn’t there enough for her. We live an hour apart and I have been working full time and going to school. We agreed to seeing eachother about 3 times a week at a minimum. But she mentioned how her sister’s bf would come see her every night when they lived about an hour apart.

A little later, we had a conversation over the phone where she told me she felt that I wasn’t really listening to her when she talked. And I’ll admit, I don’t really know how to listen/govern input as someone is talking about hard things from their life. She talked about previous parental abuse and difficult times in her life and I didn’t know how to respond. She’d talk about how stressful it is at her house with 3-7 dogs running around and her mom sometimes talking down to her. Her parents are divorced and they started having issues as soon as she was born. Her dad apparently also kept telling her that she needs to be an active part of society and constantly doing something. And about 95% of the time, it was over the phone. So it made it difficult for me to give her physical affection at least. 

She mentioned that some nights she really needed me there with her. I can’t remember exactly what I was doing one day but I believe it was helping my friend out. I ran behind on schedule a little while she was getting ready to go sing at a housewarming party. She later told me that she really needed me there while she was getting ready because she was freaking out. And towards the end of the relationship, she would lay in bed as soon as she got done with work and zoned out. I was starting to feel that way too and stopped doing my hobbies. 

I was helping my friend out this past Thursday and decided I was gonna go see her after. She said it was too far of a drive and that I shouldn’t since I have work in the morning. It was like 7pm by the time I got there and we went out for food and watched a movie at her house. I made the mistake of doing it with her and she asked me afterwards if that’s all I came there for. I don’t think she believed me when I told her I just wanted to see her, which I did. This past Saturday was her dad’s retirement party and we were planing on going. She got her nails done in the morning and asked to come over before I drove all the way there. I knew something was up but let her come over.

We had a longer hug when she arrived and started getting emotional. I asked her what’s up and started asking some questions to figure out what was going on. She came over to break up with me and said she had been hurting for a long while. She didn’t want to hurt me and felt that we should break up. She said that she didn’t feel like herself anymore and that her and I had all the conversations she felt we needed to have beforehand. And she said she’d miss me. We cried and talked for about 3 hours before she had to leave and I hugged her before she left. Told her to wish her dad a happy retirement for me. 

I sent her a text today saying “Hey, I was just thinking about you. I understand if you need to take some time to work on things or if a relationship isn’t the best thing right now. But if you ever need someone to talk to or to grab a dish of ice cream at Culver’s with, just know that I’m here for you”. She hasn’t responded or opened it about 5 hours later. 

I have a coffee cup of her family’s and she has 2 power cords of mine. I also had a pair of pants she wanted arriving this week that I ordered prior to the breakup. I’m not sure if I’ll just hold onto them, ask to give them to her, or message her mom or sister and see if they think they should be given to her. 

I just feel so terrible and feel like I wasn’t supportive enough. I should’ve been there for her more often. And at the same time, depression is your own internal battle that other people can’t always help with. Her family and I have been telling her that her toxic job isn’t good for her health and I’ve told her before we split that her mental health is more important than flight school, which is why she didn’t want to go to therapy or get meds. I feel lost, I’ve had a knot in my chest these past few days and have been breaking out in tears while at work. I feel like I lost someone great and I don’t know if I’ll ever have the chance to see them again. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m going to get a physical soon and see if they have any therapists I can talk with. I have my own mental health issues I need to solve but I can’t but help feel terrible for my ex and want her back.",1,1736816927.0,depression_partners,0,1.0,False

1i0u24y,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1i0u24y/fells_point_needs_an_action_plan_asap/,Fells Point needs an action plan ASAP,"As a resident of Fell's Point, I've grown deeply attached to the unique history and character of this area iny time here. However, it’s heartbreaking to see so many businesses shuttering their doors. The closures—attributed to factors like profit loss, inflation, landlords hiking rents, and changing spending habits among younger generations—are creating a domino effect that threatens to erode what has always made this place special.

Several key landmarks in Fell’s Point are now gone. At the heart of the neighborhood, where the squarr meets Broadway, only Max’s Taphouse remains from the cornerstone businesses. Blocked out windows on every other corner. It boggles the mind that such a pedestrian friendly, historic hub can no longer sustain even a classic pizza place. Time-tested spots like Bertha’s, Jimmy’s Diner (recently Denzel’s Shark Bar), and BOP have all disappeared. More recently, we’ve lost Bondhouse and Riptide as noted in different threads today...that's on top of these others in the last year or so...

Cocina Luchadoras, DDG/osteria Pirata/Anchor Tavern, Admiral Cup (now Atlas), Waterfront (now Atlas), Bailey's backyard, Dogwatch Tavern, Baja Tap, Fells Point Tavern, Joe's Bike shop...

It’s becoming clear that Fell’s Point risks losing its charm. The rise of groups like Atlas Restaurant Group, which swoops in to fill the void left by struggling or failed businesses, creates the illusion of choice while diminishing the neighborhood’s independent spirit.

The construction of new apartment complexes, many of which cater to the luxury market, has stalled. Some developers have even filed for bankruptcy, leaving incomplete projects and inconveniences like inaccessible sidewalks (Chasen!) These luxury units were out of reach for many in the first place, and their absence does nothing to foster a vibrant, sustainable community. I'm all for more housing, but developers need to be accountable for the blight they leave when land goes undeveloped for years (the Corner of Broadway and Eastern???)

Meanwhile, safety concerns—both valid and overblown—compound the issue, driving away both businesses and patrons. 

The charm of Fell’s Point lies in its quirky, independently owned businesses and the walkable nature with a ""small village"" feel. Spots like Jabali Coffee, 1919, Slainte, Koopers, Cats Eye, and Penny Black are run by local owners who have a vested interest in the neighborhood. They are true proprietors that have a legacy here. They provide more than just goods and services—they contribute to the community’s soul.

If we continue down this path, we risk becoming another generic district devoid of character, history, and the uniqueness that attracts residents and tourists alike.

Fell's Point needs a cohesive plan to:

Support Local Businesses: Introduce initiatives to help small, independent businesses thrive despite the challenges of inflation, high rent, and reduced foot traffic. Is there a Main Street organization still responsible here? The festival is one thing we seem to fall back on for promotion, but that doesn't support business 90% of the year.

Encourage Smart Development: Prioritize affordable housing and responsible development that benefits the community as a whole. Broadway is a prime opportunity for this, with several potential in-fill development lots as you go north. Why is there no Broadway task force with a focus on storefront and facade improvement grants? That's been a wonderful initiative in Highlandtown. 

Promote Safety Without Fearmongering: Address safety concerns with balanced measures that don’t discourage visitors or create unnecessary stigma.

Preserve History and Character: Implement policies or community-driven programs to protect the historic identity of Fell’s Point and prevent a corporate monoculture.

I’d love to hear from fellow residents, business owners, and others who care about Fell’s Point. What ideas do you have to support the community, preserve its history, and help it thrive in the long term?

And lastly, let's not forget to celebrate and support the newcomers who have opened in recent months!

AREPI is an amazing addition to Thames street, run by the kindest family. It brought new cuisine and fresh offerings here. And Broadway Hot Pot is so good I've been multiple times in the past month - also a brand new offering of Chinese cuisine that was missing from the city in general. Sacre Sucre purchased an entire building here to create world class pastries (and serve some wine), yet all we heard about was the drama from their neighbor who opposed it...really??

------------------------------------------------------

Decorating your kitchen doesn’t have to break the bank. You can create a cozy and stylish space with just a few clever ideas. Let’s explore some creative ways to enhance your home kitchen decoration while staying within budget.

First, focus on the color scheme. A fresh coat of paint can transform any room. Consider painting one wall with a bold color that reflects your personality. For the other walls, opt for lighter shades to create a more spacious feel. Accent colors can come from accessories like dish towels or curtains that tie everything together.

If you have open shelving in your kitchen, use it to your advantage. Instead of hiding your plates and cups in cabinets, display them on shelves. You can mix and match different styles to create an eclectic look. Make sure to arrange items by color to create visual appeal. Add a few decorative pieces like plants or vintage cookbooks for a personal touch.

Lighting is another crucial aspect when considering home kitchen decoration. Replacing old light fixtures or adding new ones can dramatically change the ambiance. Look for unique pendant lights or fairy lights to add charm without spending much. You can even create your own lighting by wrapping LED strips under cabinets to illuminate countertops, giving a modern and stylish feel.

Another fun idea is to incorporate art into your kitchen design. Buy inexpensive prints or create your own wall art. Frames can be found at thrift stores or online marketplaces. Hang them above your coffee station or dining area to add character. Your art doesn’t need to be conventional; consider hanging a collection of vintage kitchen utensils for a quirky, nostalgic vibe.

Bringing nature into your kitchen can enhance the decor while improving air quality. Having fresh herbs in pots not only adds color but is also practical for cooking. You can start a small herb garden on your windowsill using reclaimed containers or inexpensive ceramic pots. If you lack space, consider hanging plants that flow down to create a beautiful greenery effect.

Try adding a creative backsplash to elevate your kitchen’s style without the hefty price tag. Peel-and-stick tiles are a simple and affordable way to do this. Choose patterns that excite you, and apply them directly over your existing tiles. This can create a focal point behind your stove or sink, allowing for a fresh and trendy look.

Organizing your kitchen in a visually pleasing way can also enhance its overall decor. Use glass jars for dry goods, as they not only look great but help you stay organized. Label them for an added personal touch, or use chalkboard paint on the jars for a fun, interactive feature. This strategy will keep your kitchen tidy and stylish.

Consider using multifunctional furniture or decor elements. A stylish cart can serve as extra counter space and a mobile serving station. You can often find affordable options at second-hand stores or online platforms. Make sure to choose a cart that complements your kitchen's overall aesthetic.

Another great way to decorate on a budget is to swap your cabinet hardware. New knobs and handles can instantly refresh old cabinets. Look for unique pieces at flea markets or online. Choose styles that resonate with your theme, whether it’s rustic, modern, or vintage.

Consider your window treatments. Instead of expensive blinds, opt for cheerful fabric curtains. You can sew your own or even use a tablecloth that matches your kitchen’s color scheme. The right fabric can add warmth and softness to space, creating an inviting atmosphere.

The Impact of Color Schemes in Home Kitchen Decoration
------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right color scheme for your home kitchen can completely transform the space. Colors not only add aesthetics but also influence mood and functionality. When decorating your kitchen, consider how various shades can affect the atmosphere and usability of the room.

Light colors like white and pastel shades can make a small kitchen appear larger and brighter. These hues reflect light, creating an illusion of space and openness. For instance, when you opt for a pale blue or soft yellow, you'll find the room feels airy and welcoming. If your kitchen lacks natural light, light colors are essential to enhance visibility and create a more inviting environment.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-decoration  
  
On the other hand, darker shades, such as deep blue, charcoal, or even black, can add elegance and sophistication. These colors work exceptionally well in larger kitchens, as they can create a cozy, intimate atmosphere. Pairing these dark tones with appropriate lighting and contrasting accents can create a striking balance that captures attention without overwhelming the senses.

When selecting a color scheme, consider the following popular palettes:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-decoration  
  
- **Monochromatic**: Utilizing variations of a single color can create a harmonious and cohesive look. Shades of gray or different tones of blue can be soothing and elegant.
- **Complementary**: This scheme uses colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, like blue and orange. These colors provide balance and energy, making a kitchen feel dynamic yet balanced.
- **Analogous**: Colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, such as green and blue, can create a serene and comfortable space. This scheme is ideal for kitchens where relaxation and family gatherings are prioritized.
- **Accent Colors**: Integrating bold colors as accents, like a bright red or sunny yellow, can enliven a neutral kitchen base. Such pops of color can draw attention to specific areas, like a kitchen island or a set of shelves.

Additionally, the psychology of color plays a significant role in how you and your family will feel in the kitchen. For instance, warm colors such as reds, oranges, and yellows can stimulate appetite and conversation, which is perfect for family mealtimes. Conversely, cool colors like greens and blues are calming and can help create a serene cooking environment—ideal for those busy weekday evenings when you need to unwind.

To bring together your color scheme effectively, consider these strategies:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-decoration  
  
- **Determine the Focal Point**: Decide which feature will be the star. It might be the cabinets, backsplash, or even a unique piece of kitchenware.
- **Layer Textures**: Varying textures within your color scheme can add depth. For example, combining matte cabinets with glossy tiles can create visual interest.
- **Use Color Chips**: Always test your color choices. Purchase samples and see how they look at different times of the day and under various lighting conditions.
- **Harmonize with Adjacent Rooms**: Ensure your kitchen colors complement the adjoining living spaces for a seamless flow throughout your home.

An essential aspect to remember is that while trends influence color choices, your personal style should take precedence. A beautiful kitchen reflects your preferences and lifestyle. If you love bold colors, don’t shy away from expressing that in your decor. Alternatively, if your taste leans toward the minimalist side, softer tones with enough personality can still speak volumes.

Remember that color trends may change, but the comfort and functionality of your kitchen remain constants. Invest your time in colors that resonate with you and create an atmosphere where family and friends gather. Think about what feelings you want to evoke in your kitchen space. With thoughtful planning, the right color scheme can create a kitchen that’s not only functional but also the heart of your home.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-decoration  
  
Taking all these factors into account will ensure that your chosen colors contribute positively to your kitchen environment, making it a space where you love to cook and entertain. Whether you choose to go bold or subtle, the impact of your color scheme on home kitchen decoration is undeniable.

### Conclusion

Decorating your kitchen doesn’t have to drain your wallet. By exploring creative ideas tailored for a budget, you can create a space that not only looks good but feels inviting too. Simple changes, like adding decorative elements or repurposing existing items, can transform the look of your kitchen. Consider incorporating high-impact pieces that reflect your personality, such as vibrant dishware or unique artwork, to make your kitchen a true reflection of who you are.

Color schemes play a pivotal role in your kitchen’s ambiance. Choosing the right colors can evoke emotions and set the mood. Warm hues like reds and yellows can create a cozy atmosphere, while cool colors like blues and greens offer a refreshing vibe. Experimenting with different shades in your kitchen through paint, accessories, or even new linens can revitalize the space effortlessly.

Whether you're going for creative budget-friendly hacks or considering the psychological impacts of color, every little element counts. When you take the time to personalize the kitchen, it becomes a space where memories are made, meals are shared, and creativity flourishes.

Sorry for the rambling, I'm just in a bit of a slump/funk, anyone wanna chat about nothing and everything ? How's 2025 going for you so far ?","Hi, nearly 31 year old male from Australia here. Just in a new years slump, actually, been a few months now. Life is in slow motion. I work, I sleep, I eat, I do life admin shit, and then the next day appears. 

I've been really lazy lately. Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just an ear to complain to, or someone to talk to. I need to get back into the gym and pursuing my hobbies. Easier said than done. 

Life is getting a bit stale post 30 years old. Maybe I'm just disillusioned.

What's the last book you read cover to cover? I used to read a lot in highschool. I think mine was 'The Old Man and The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway in 2021. It wasn't too long, maybe took me a week or two to finish. I want to start reading novels again. I have a stack of books that are gathering dust. I am generally aimless when it comes to life. Recently I've been feeling very listless, a bit bored, and despondent of things in general and I don't know why. 

A bit about me: 

* I prefer tea over coffee first thing in the morning.
* I hate running but at one point in time I could do a sub 25 min 5K. I am now severely unfit.
* I have two degrees in the hard sciences but now work in IT.
* I want to produce music one day, mainly house/electronic/EDM. But mainly house music. 
* I have a hard time keeping myself accountable to myself. Hit me up if you're looking for an accountability partner.
* I have a prominent scar on the back of my right hand.

A bit about you:

* In that 25-35 age bracket would be nice :)
* Somewhat disillusioned with life (just like me !)
* Male or female, I really don't mind !
*  Similar timezone to me would be nice :) I am in GMT+10
* A love for music and the arts would be appreciated

I am happy to trade pictures of myself and eventually move to another platform like Signal or WhatsApp. Also just to point out - I am NOT looking for anything nsfw or any lewd chats.

Im 26 m and she is 24 f. Been together 4 years. Had many tough patches. Lots were my fault. I recently got introduced to Correy Wayne and I see a lot of shit Ive done wrong.

But basically sex started getting less frequent I think its my fault. But she is a weird girl in general imo. She doesn't want to be together that much because she needs time for herself (I know what yall are thinking. She is 100% not cheating and I am certain of that). Basically we are both business oriented and she just needs more time to work on her business But also sex started to die down quite a lot. I fell into the trap of being a desperate guy and almost begging for sex. Then intimacy died down which I also started almost begging for.

But at this point after a big fight. (It was kind of my fault) We had dead bedroom for like over a month pushing 2 now. We meet up for drinks, dinners, coffee, even took her to the theatre the other day. Her main excuse that night was that she was too tired for sex. I mean correct me if Im wrong but if the guy courts a woman properly, shows leadership, shows care and everything without being too much of a nice guy she should want to get on?? 

Moving on she started blasting me with random angry messages. For example. Im seeing a therapist, for myself and also for the relationship. And she gets super mad because apparently I dont talk to the therapist enough about her. Therapy aint about her. Therapy is about making myself better.. Or another example. She wants a car. And me and my dad are helping her look for one. But my dad is ofc busy and so am I most days and she keeps bringing it up that we are not putting enough effort into it. I mean its okay that she would say that to me (Well it really isnt) but its almost like she is pissed at my dad for being busy and not giving time to search for a car for her. And she sends me angry texts about this at 2 am and Im just soo fucking fed up with it.

You know after having a huge fight which was my fault I was willing to do alot to fix this but at this point I just want to call her a fucking bitch and tell her to stick her head up where the sun dont shine.

 Im just scared I wont be able to find a woman who loves and cares for me. It seems like 26 is kind of a scary age for getting out of a relationship.

Ahhhhhh. I dont know what to do. But I am so sick of this emotional abuse she puts me throught almost daily. Either witholding sex and telling me to deal with it. Or sayin I dont do enough for her when I drive her everywhere. Pickup stuff for her etc

Like imagine this. Since she doesnt drive atm every time she needs to go to the store, I drive her. Every time she needs to call someone I do it for her cause she is scared of phone calls or whatever. Like I provide whatever I can and then one day out of the blue she starts attacking me that I do not support her financially (We make the same amount of money and I barely have enough for myself). It was nothing like that when we were starting out. She was loving, kind, empathic. At this point its like she sees me as her errand boy.

Our friend group meets up regularly for brunch or coffee to just talk and catch up and a few weeks ago, we were talking about being a mom since one of our other friends had recently announced that she is pregnant. My friend said that there are struggles but her husband is incredibly supportive and helps make things easy for her.

I have always thought her husband was physically attractive but other than that, he seemed too busy with his demanding job and other things he’s working toward to be an attentive husband or father but my friend has been in love with him for a long time so I never really bothered saying anything. The conversation made me see him in a different light as someone who is actually a loving and supportive partner and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him since. He’s everything nice, he’s successful, smart, handsome, makes a lot of money, he’s loving and thoughtful and genuinely a great partner and I’ve definitely developed a crush on him. I know it’s wrong and it would hurt my friend but I genuinely want him.

I was at their place for coffee with our friends one evening and I knew he would probably get home around the time we were there and I wore something revealing hoping he would notice me but when he got home, he just gave her a kiss and said hi and we had a minute of small talk and nothing else. I tried to get his attention again at a small gathering at a different friend’s place and wore an outfit I knew he would like based on my friend’s pictures with him and thought we might exchange some looks or something and still nothing from his side and I have a feeling she caught me staring at him.

If he ever showed me any interest, I know I would act on it and it would destroy our friendship and their marriage. I’m still trying to think of other ways I could create opportunities for something to start between us. My friend and I have the same body type and physical features so the attraction is definitely there but I don’t know how to actually initiate things with him without setting off alarms around her and our friends. It’s genuinely so frustrating knowing that she’s probably sleeping in his arms every night while I’m trying to figure out how to get his attention. AITA for feeling this way?

6'4"" Male 397lbs was the highest weight I saw.  I lost weight to 389 then started 2.5 zepbound.  That was 15 weeks ago, and the highest number I see on the scale is 373 with it sometimes dipping to 370.  First 8 weeks 2.5, the last 7 weeks have been 5, I am staying on five as I am continuing to lose weight at the rate of about a 1lb or two a week.

  
My secret?  Take the medicine, and then do what you feel.  I mainly sit around, but I get in about 2 liters of water a day, supplement with a 30g protein shake, and a 20g protein bar, coffee (1 or 2 cups depending on how I feel), and dinner is what I want to eat (sandwich, beans, rice, meat, fried chicken, brisket, ham, chips, girl scout cookies, etc...).  I am not doing ANYTHING actively except getting my shots in on time.

  
What have I felt during this time:

1. I just can not eat like I used too, I grab two slices of pizza I can finish one, when I used to be able to eat three.  Think about that, I know I have to eat less, by grabbing two, but can only finish one.  It is a real battle to overcome bad habits.

2. I rarely go to McDonalds, primarily because I can stay in front of the cravings.  If I ""think"" I am hungry and I am driving I used to stop at McDonalds and get something to eat, feel crappy, then maybe get something later.  NOW I have the WILL to not stop, no I don't have the desire to stop.  This is big as eating in my car was a huge trigger, now I chew gum and drink water.

3.  I have food patience.  If I know my roast is going to be done in 3 hours, at most I will drink a shake, and/or eat a protein bar and water.  I used to eat a sandwich while I waited.

4. Side effects, slow food movement.  I don't want to say constipation, because when I have to go, I go and it is often times a lot.  So I may not go for 3-4 days, but when I do go I may go 2x in one day.  No nausea.  I do feel a bit of anxiety, from time to time.  And sometimes I feel full rested at 4am, only to go back to sleep at 6am.  But none of this is anything I worry about.

5. Energy has slowly been improving,  I have told myself not to force working out and I am not.  For me working out means running my errands everyday, and that is real progress.

So when am I going to kick my dose up? I don't know.  I like where I am with this.  Down almost 30lbs in four months, working on my habits, so I don't eat ""just because"".  My goal weight is 250lbs, but my happy weight will 299, as I haven't seen that side of 300lbs in over 20 years.

Where can I find a link, preferably free","The year was 1983. It was late at night and dark outside. Only a dim light was on inside the Ford residence's living room.

""I'm willing to move abroad to live with you, Mom and Dad,"" Evelyn Ford said.

Francis Graham and Maureen White were on the line on the other side of the world. They were so overcome by Evelyn's words that they started crying. ""That's great, Evie! We wouldn't have been separated for so long if not for that earthquake. We didn't mean to abandon you. We'll head over there right now to pick you up!""

Evelyn felt an odd sense of bitterness surge when she heard her parents crying. She took a deep breath before saying, ""Give me another two weeks. I have some things to deal with here; I'll head over once I'm done. Then, I'll remain by your side for the rest of my life.""

The Grahams seemed to realize something. ""Yes, of course. We got ahead of ourselves. The Fords raised you for many years, and we heard your older brother doted on you since you were a child. It's only right for you to have a proper farewell with them.""

Evelyn's heart trembled at the mention of Cameron Ford. A different sense of bitterness and heartache welled in her.

A horrific earthquake had happened the year she was six. She and her parents had been separated, and the authorities had ultimately arranged for the Ford family to adopt her.

The Fords were made of old money and had been around for generations. However, James Ford and Ivy Stone were always busy with work. Though they'd adopted her per the authorities' arrangement, they hadn't had much time to care about her.

Rather than saying the Ford family had raised her, it would be more accurate to say Cameron, her older brother, had raised her.

When she was seven, she was afraid of thunder. He was the one who'd held her and comforted her in her bed. He'd sang her a lullaby.

When she was ten, she was envious of her classmates' snacks and toys. He was the one who'd bought every snack and toy available in the store and doted on her like a princess.

When she was 14, her period came for the first time. He was the one who'd taught her what she needed to know and rubbed her belly after making her a hot drink.

He would immediately bring her whatever she wanted, whether it was a hairclip, shoes, clothes, a gramophone, or even a mini car.

The people who knew him well always teased him about being overly doting toward her. They wondered whether anyone could marry her and take her away from him.

Cameron had pulled Evelyn into his arms with a laugh at the time. ""If anyone wants to marry my precious sister, they'll first have to treat her better than I do.""

She'd buried her face against his chest then, so he hadn't seen her blush. No one knew she had feelings for him. She'd fallen for him a long time ago, given all the days and nights they'd spent together.

She didn't dare confess her love for him, though. She vaguely realized her feelings weren't anything to be proud of, so she only dared to secretly record them in her journal. The only person she told about this was her best friend, Jocelyn Irwin.

Evelyn didn't expect Jocelyn to tell Cameron about this secret. That fateful night, he'd barged into her room and grabbed her journal. Then, he'd ripped it to pieces with a grim expression. He'd thrown the pieces at her, and the sharp edges of the paper cut her face. She turned away from the pain.

""Do you realize how shameful and immoral you are by developing feelings for your brother?"" he'd roared.

That was her first time seeing him so infuriated. A single sentence from him was enough to make her feel like her heart had been stabbed several times over.

She'd stared at him dazedly as tears filled her eyes and silently trickled down her face. He'd stormed off before she could say anything.

After that, Cameron did everything he could to avoid seeing Evelyn. Even when they occasionally ran into each other, he would look at her coldly like she was a stranger.

A week later, he even announced that he was marrying Jocelyn. The news had stunned her. She couldn't even wrap her head around how and when they'd gotten together.

She wanted to press for answers after dinner but stumbled upon Cameron pinning Jocelyn to the wall and kissing her passionately. He was usually so calm and composed.

That night, Evelyn shed tears. She knew she wouldn't get the answers to certain questions, so there was no need to search for them anymore.

Just then, a family search service contacted her and told her they'd found her birth parents. They'd been depressed for a long time after she'd gone missing, and they hadn't stopped searching for her despite being sent abroad as diplomats. They almost fainted upon finally hearing news about her.

At that moment, Evelyn couldn't help but think perhaps these things were already written in the stars. It was fated that she and Cameron would never be together and that her time with the Ford family would be nothing more than a dream. It was time for her to return to her original path.

So, she decided to return to her family and be reunited with her parents. She also decided to let go of the love she'd harbored for Cameron for years.

…

Evelyn headed downstairs early the following morning. She smiled demurely when James and Ivy urged her to join them for breakfast. She sat beside them and told them that her birth parents had found her and that she was going abroad to be with them.

Ivy hurriedly held her hands. She sounded happy for her. At the same time, she realized this meant it was hard to say when they would see each other again. A hint of reluctance tinged her tone.

""This is good news, Evelyn. I'm so glad you've found your family. Have you told your brother about this?""

Evelyn was taken aback. Should she tell Cameron? He was all over Jocelyn now. Did it matter whether or not she told him?

""What did you want to tell me?"" A cool voice rang out behind them. Evelyn turned to see Cameron standing in the doorway. He looked as tall and handsome as always.
Chapter 2
Ivy was about to speak when Evelyn changed the subject. ""It's nothing. You're back, Cameron.""

Cameron faltered when he heard her address him by his full first name, which she hadn't done in a long time. He couldn't help appraising her. He couldn't remember when she'd started calling him ""Cam"" instead of ""Cameron."" Was it when she was 18? 15? Or earlier?

At the time, he thought it was because they were starting to drift apart as she grew older. Later, he found out it was because she'd fallen for him.

His gaze darkened at her reverting to calling him by his full first name. He stared at her for a while. There seemed to be something different about her.

After a while, he retracted his gaze and lowered his eyes. Then, he approached Evelyn and his parents before putting a gift on the table. He said, ""These are gifts Jocelyn bought for you guys, Mom and Dad. She said they're just little trinkets and hopes you'll like them.""

Ivy beamed at that. ""Of course we will! Josie's gifts are always great. Did you thank her for us?""

James got up, and a small smile lit up his usually stern face. ""Remember to bring those coffee beans to Josie's family the next time you visit her.""

He and Ivy were very satisfied with Jocelyn, who was soon to be their daughter-in-law. They chatted for a while longer and mentioned that they would like to invite her parents over on the weekend if they had the time. It was clear they wanted to discuss wedding details.

Evelyn sat there and watched the three of them chat happily. A wave of loneliness washed over her. She clenched her fists but soon released them.

At this moment, she clearly sensed that she was only an outsider in this family. Then again, she wouldn't need to be plagued by these matters in the future. With that thought in mind, she got up and returned to her room.

Cameron looked up mid-conversation when he noticed this. All he saw was Evelyn's figure disappearing around the corner.

Was he imagining things? She'd only said one sentence since his return. This wasn't like her at all.

…

That afternoon, Evelyn prepared to leave the house and head to the authorities to update her identification. When she headed downstairs, she saw Jocelyn seated beside Cameron. She was smiling as she watched him peel an orange.

He deftly peeled it and removed the pith. Then, he held a slice to Jocelyn's lips. She blushed and glanced at him before biting it. Her lips brushed against his fingers.

He chuckled and wiped her mouth with a paper towel. ""Is it sweet?""

She nodded before holding a slice to his lips. ""Why don't you try it?""

Evelyn silently retracted her gaze when she saw how intimate and affectionate they were with each other. She walked down the stairs and headed straight for the door.

""Evelyn!"" Jocelyn suddenly called out to her. She turned to see the former beckon to her. ""It's Cameron's off day, and we're going to a park. Do you want to join us?""

Evelyn shook her head. ""I wouldn't want to disturb you two on your date.""

Jocelyn smiled. ""You're my sister-in-law. How would you be disturbing us?""

She emphasized ""sister-in-law,"" seemingly wanting to remind Evelyn of her place. In the past, this would've hurt Evelyn so much that she would feel out of breath. Now that she only thought of Cameron as her brother, it didn't faze her. She was calm and collected.

""I have something to do. Maybe we can do this next time.""

Jocelyn's smile stiffened at the repeated rejection. Her tone immediately turned aggrieved as she asked, ""Are you still mad at me for taking your brother away from you, Evelyn? Is that why you don't want to come with us?""

Cameron hurriedly held her and frowned. ""You've always been the one I've liked. How can you say that you took me from her?""

This made her ears turn red. She gave him a chiding glance as she thumped his chest. He chuckled and pulled her closer. Then, he pressed a kiss to her hair. ""Leave her be if she doesn't want to come.""

Evelyn forced a smile. They did indeed have to leave her be. It wouldn't be long before their paths diverged. They would live on separate sides of the world soon.

She politely bid them goodbye before leaving.
Chapter 3
Evelyn headed to the dance troupe after finishing her business. She headed to the office of her superior, Rowena Green. There, she saw the awards their troupe had won and photos of everyone dancing lining the wall. She ran her fingers over them, and her gaze was filled with reluctance.

She thought she would spend the rest of her youth and life with this dance troupe, but the separation came so abruptly.

""Evelyn."" Rowena entered the office and patted her shoulder.

The bitterness Evelyn had just suppressed welled up again when she saw Rowena. Rowena had guided her for the past decade.

She clenched her fists and took a deep breath. ""I'm here to turn in my resignation, Ms. Green. My birth parents found me, and I'm migrating abroad to be with them.""

Rowena's eyes widened in surprise. Then, joy replaced it. She sounded happy as she said, ""That's great news! Will you continue dancing when you're abroad?""

She'd watched as Evelyn had gone from being a shy, timid girl to a beautiful young woman. She knew that Evelyn had poured her heart and soul into dancing. It had made her blossom and gave her confidence. That was why Rowena didn't want Evelyn to give it up.

A hint of determination flashed in Evelyn's eyes as she looked at the photos on the wall. She smiled and nodded. ""Dancing has always been my dream. I won't give up on it so easily. I'll continue dancing in the future.""

Rowena nodded approvingly. She'd always admired Evelyn's determination, so she'd given her the troupe's principal dancer position. She'd done it to train Evelyn to take over for her in the future.

It was too bad that the plan had fallen through. Rowena couldn't exactly stop Evelyn from leaving the country to be reunited with her family. 

Rowena asked tentatively, ""Are you leaving immediately? The dance you've spent the last year choreographing is about to make its first run. You put your heart into it. You must show it on stage.""

Evelyn nodded. ""I've already discussed this with my parents and told them I'll join them after settling everything here. I have two weeks before I leave. I have enough time to dance first.""

Rowena was relieved to hear that. She patted Evelyn on the shoulder. They chatted for a while longer before Evelyn went to practice. She only grabbed her things and headed home when it was late at night.

Surprisingly, she found that Jocelyn was still around when she got home. As she listened to the conversation, she realized everyone was discussing the wedding gown and accessories.

""My head is spinning from all those designs and accessories, Mrs. Ford. Evelyn and I have been best friends for years, and I was hoping she could help me pick. She knows my likes and dislikes, anyway,"" Jocelyn said.

Evelyn happened to enter at that moment. Ivy beckoned her to join them. ""Josie was just talking about you, Evelyn. How about you accompany her for the next few days so she can pick out the things she needs for the wedding?""

Evelyn looked at Jocelyn. Jocelyn was smiling, but her smile turned provocative when she met Evelyn's eyes.

Evelyn lowered her eyes and decided to turn them down. ""I'm sorry, but I don't have the time. I have things to do at the dance troupe.""

She only had half a month left and was due to perform soon. She had many things to deal with before leaving, so shopping with Jocelyn wasn't something she had time for.

However, the cheery atmosphere died down at her words. Cameron looked at her icily and said, ""Your best friend is getting married. Can't you set aside your things for her? You're going with Jocelyn, and that's final. I'll ask the troupe to give you some time off starting tomorrow!""

What right did she have to say no when he was forcing her to take time off? She smiled bitterly without saying anything else.

For the next few days, Evelyn had no choice but to set everything aside to focus on shopping with Jocelyn for the things she needed for the wedding. She thought Jocelyn would only need to head to the shopping mall to select a few things.

However, Jocelyn brought her from one end of the city to another. She wanted Evelyn's opinion on everything from the wedding gown to a hairpin. Whenever Evelyn suggested she send someone to ask Cameron what he thought, she would give Evelyn a chiding look.

""What's the point of asking him? All he does is give me money. He knows nothing aside from that. You're the one who knows what I think. I asked him to pick out our wedding rings with me last time, and do you know what he did? He had someone send an array of rings to my house so I could pick whichever one I wanted!""

Jocelyn sounded like she was ranting as she tried on a headpiece, but it was clear from the look in her eyes that she was boasting. To her dismay, Evelyn listened silently without reacting the way she expected.

She bit her lip and was about to say something else when she saw Cameron standing at the door. She turned and cried in surprise, ""Cameron? What are you doing here?""

Evelyn looked up to see Jocelyn run to Cameron and throw herself into his arms. She kissed his jaw sweetly. He caressed her hair and said dotingly, ""You said you wanted to go to the chapel outside of the city, right? I took half a day off to come pick you up.""

They whispered sweet nothings to each other, making Jocelyn blush and burrow deeper into his embrace. Then, she seemed to think of something and went back to Evelyn. She held Evelyn's hand but spoke to Cameron. ""Evelyn's been with me for the past few days. How about we bring her with us?""

Cameron didn't even spare Evelyn a glance. He merely picked up the things Jocelyn had bought and turned to leave. ""Whatever.""",1,1736815589.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I've had some good experiences with Meetup groups in Charlottesville, but sometimes I just don't feel like driving an hour to get to an event. And unfortunately, there aren't many active groups in our city. So, with some anxiety, I decided to make one myself! I *know* it says 30's and 40's, but I may just remove that, and if you're interested, join up anyway, I'm not going to reject you. The first meetup is a low stakes coffee hangout at The Flour District just to get to know one another. A few things about me:  I'm a 38-year-old professional woman looking to expand my social circle. I like:

* Discovering new restaurants and cafes
* Board games and video games
* Reading (especially fiction and memoirs)
* Hiking and outdoor exploration
* Theater and performing arts
* Travel and city exploration
* Movies (from blockbusters to indies)

Honestly, as far as activities go, I'm down for almost anything, especially if it's something I've never done or tried before. I hope some of you who are looking for friends join up; it's lonely being the only one in there, lol.

Question: What do *you* *all* think of the group's name? Should I get rid of the ages?

Those things have mostly resolved (thank god!), but I'm left feeling very uncertain about whether my body is functioning correctly. I find that I'm peeing about once every 90 - 120 minutes, and somewhat less frequently than that in the evening. I don't wake up at night to pee. When I do pee, it's usually fairly clear and takes 15-30 seconds to empty.

What bothers me is that at about the 60 minute mark, I can ""detect"" that I have some urine in my bladder - either by giving a push with my body or pressing on it with my hand. Once I become aware of this, I find I'm very stressed out until I ""actually"" have to pee (basically the feeing has gotten to a point where I can't distract myself from it), and then after I pee, I'm constantly worried about how quickly I'll be able to ""detect"" it again.

I have described this to my partner and she basically thinks it's normal. She says that peeing every 90 - 120 minutes during the day is not strange for someone drinking coffee & water, and that she'd probably be able to ""feel"" something in her bladder at the 60 minute mark if she was always checking for it. Her thinking is that I'm stuck with hyperawareness as a result of the prostatitis episode, and that in fact my body is just back to the way it was before prostatitis. 

Unfortunately, I didn't think about urination *at all* before prostatitis (oh how I long for those days), so I really have no idea what my baseline was. I drink about 2L of water per day and 2-3 cups of coffee. I'm trying to figure out if I need to work on something physical or if I just need to work on accepting that I'm back to the way I always was.",1,1736815537.0,OveractiveBladder,0,1.0,False

Hey all. I work in the TV industry as a lighting tech. Today, as I’m trading war stories with a few coworkers, I pull up a video from a couple years back. While on a major television series, I’m on a barge in New York harbor operating a boom lift outfitted with two 18,000 watt HMI lamps lighting a yacht party. Ironically it was an unmanned aerial shot, however the ‘copter is not in this footage. Anyway, I’m showing this video, and my friend looks at me with *that* look. “Did you see that?”. So I scrub back thru the video, and sure enough, well, the footage speaks for itself. I’ve taken hundreds of shots of various rigs, and am used to bugs flying by attracted by the light, but on closer inspection, this was no bug. You can see it clearly go in front of the lift mast, and it’s not something flying low being illuminated by the light, it’s a little hard to tell, but there’s solid black siders on each side to control the beam. It doesn’t move like a bird, and is going way too fast to be a plane, certainly nothing civilian. I can’t attest for the actual speed, but that thing is moving. I checked the date, and there was a meteor shower on the 30th and 31st (tau Herculid) of that month, but in my (admittedly little) experience watching meteor showers, I’ve never seen them maintain their brightness like this, usually the burn up. If you look carefully, just before the main one comes into the right of frame, there’s another faint one just to the left of the light. I guess it could be space junk, or just the blind luck of getting two meteors on a random night in one of the most light polluted skies on the eastern seaboard. I have about ten minutes combined of random footage looking up in that direction throughout the night, nothing notable in any of it. The only editing I did was to cut the interesting few seconds out so you guys don’t have to listen to a bunch of salty grips complaining about not having coffee delivered. I dunno guys, I can’t figure it out, so I humbly submit this to the hivemind. Whatever it was, it definitely wasn’t FAA compliant. Stay safe out there everyone. 


TLDR: was going through some old work footage and found these two objects blasting through the sky at high speed and figured this is the place to go.

He has to be doing something. Whether it's making phone calls, doing research online, going out for a run, fixing stuff around the house, going to home depot, grocery store, etc. Even during our last snow storm, where the roads were icy, he couldn't stand being inside the house, so we drove to the grocery store to buy some stuff that wasn't even necessary.

My mom, brother, and I (24) are the opposite. We like to relax, watch TV, chill with each other, have some coffee, chat, lay on the couch or bed. We obviously do our chores and clean around and do whatever errands we need to do. My brother and I work out. 
But if my dad sees us sitting down, not being busy with something productive,  he gets upset all of a sudden. He starts lecturing us about how we have to do this and that, keep our minds busy, blah blah blah. He always wants us to think and act like him. Have the same mindset. 

I love my dad but honestly I feel so relaxed when he's working and not at home during the day because I can just lay down and do nothing after doing whatever I needed to do. When he's at home during the day, I can't even sit on the couch or I know he's going to say something.

Im currently sitting down writing this at 6pm and my dad already lectured me about get ready to sleep, shower and prepare whatever I need to prepare before work tomorrow. I know but I still have some time to relax?? Plus I just ate dinner and I'm going to workout in a bit after my food digests...
