I'm thinking this area for a small table and chairs. Initially thought a pub style long rectangular table facing the window would be good, but feels ""on the go"". 

Now thinking a coffee bar cabinet below the cabinets and a small dinner/cafe table.

Dimensions: from counter to start of wall cabinets is 6 feet, cabinets stick out 1 foot from wall. Total of 7 feet of space. The rolling cart below the counter space can be removed. Cabling is easy enough to route around.

Any Help?,"On March 6th, 2024, I visited a chiropractor for chronic neck and shoulder pain. During the session, he aggressively pressed down on my head while I was seated, performing a neck-compression test. To be clear, he had both his hands over the top of my head, as I was in a seated position, and pushed in forcefully and suddenly. 

Since then, I’ve experienced ongoing extreme discomfort, including lightheadedness, faintness, paresthesia in my left ring and pinky fingers, head pressure, dizziness, and fatigue. The first couple months were so severe I had multiple ER visits and innumerable doctor's visits Ten months later, my symptoms persist, though less intense. I still experience lightness, tingling in my left fingers and head, head discomfort and heaviness, and episodes of overwhelming unsteadiness, which I call “waves” or “rushes,” that I have to wait out.

I’ve had extensive tests—Cervical MRI, Brain MRI, CT scans, blood work, and heart tests—all showing nothing abnormal. Despite seeing multiple doctors, no one has a clear explanation. My daily life has been significantly impacted, and I can no longer exercise, drink coffee, and, many other things. 

I'm sorry this is so long.  Any suggestions on how to improve would be immensely appreciated, as this has been a difficult struggle for the past 10 months. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thank you, and God bless.",1,1735612651.0,Cervicalinstability,0,1.0,False

Even if no one has any advice I appreciate this space to get my thoughts together and jotted down. I need to likely get  pro help and the first step for me is trying to accurately explain whats going on. 

I have been on Vyvanse for a few years and Paxil for 18 years. I am a 34 year old male for context. Recently laid off but was working remote prior so all of these were problems before. I def feel worse that I am unemployed but I would be lying if I said these only started recently.  

  
1. **Constantly chasing dopamine.** I get up earlier than needed, often a tired still, just to drink coffee while I wait for Vyvanse to kick in. I then spend the whole morning and early afternoon on the internet, social media etc. Way too many of these days I end up looking at porn and masturbating. I am married and besides the fact its a bad habit, it has ruined my sex life and I feel like a terrible husband. 

I usually try to do something else for an hour after lunch but that is basically just to kill time between Vyvanse starting to wear down and having my 2nd/3rd cups off coffee. At which point  I scroll the internet, read articles, fantasy sports, social media  again. 

Come early evening once the the afternoon caffeine has worn off, I start feeling depressed and basically binge eat for dinner. Many a nights ordering a milk shake or something from Uber Eats for dessert.  I have ballooned up to 250 pounds. 

  
2. My whole life I have struggled to brush my teeth as well as do consistent habits due to executive function issues.  I know what I need to do but cant get myself to do it.  Put my clothes in a hamper? Why bother I will never do consistently. I know its bad to think that way but thats how my brain works. 

I hate what my life has become.  All I do is just USE the internet/social media, read books and watch TV.  

My day consists of morning caffeine-Vyvanse dopamine- craving my afternoon caffeine- binge eating for dinner. Its so unhealthy and  unproductive and I am going nowhere living like this. Every day is the same, and if a certain day is not the same, it would only be for a negative reason  never anything positive. 

I just have ZERO discipline to make changes. Deleting apps and stuff doesn't work for me.  No willpower and I am in a really a bad spot. I dont even really know where to begin to make changes. I

For example at the right size grind I need and just under 18 grams of coffee it’s at around 8 on the screen (8 seconds of grinding). How can I get this number to display the coffee weight in grams instead of number of seconds of grinding?

","In today’s interconnected world, where we rely heavily on the internet for work, communication, and entertainment, protecting our online privacy and security has never been more important. From hackers targeting public Wi-Fi networks to governments and companies tracking your online activity, threats to personal privacy are everywhere. This is where VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)In today’s interconnected world, where we rely heavily on the internet for work, communication, and entertainment, protecting our online privacy and security has never been more important. From hackers targeting public Wi-Fi networks to governments and companies tracking your online activity, threats to personal privacy are everywhere. This is where VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) come into play. VPNs are powerful tools designed to protect your privacy and secure your online activity. In this post, we’ll explain how VPNs work and the key ways they help safeguard your personal information and enhance your online security.

1. What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates an encrypted, secure connection between your device and the internet. It routes your internet traffic through a remote server, masking your real IP address and encrypting your data. This makes it harder for third parties, such as hackers, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or even government agencies, to monitor your online activities or steal your personal information.

2. Key Ways VPNs Protect Your Online Privacy and Security

2.1. Encrypting Your Internet Connection

The main function of a VPN is to encrypt your internet traffic, which ensures that no one can intercept and read your data. Whether you’re sending an email, making an online purchase, or accessing a website, a VPN scrambles your data so that even if it’s intercepted, it remains unreadable.

How it works: VPNs use powerful encryption protocols, such as AES-256-bit encryption, to secure your data. This encryption is so strong that it is virtually impossible for hackers or any third parties to decipher the information.

Why it’s important: Encryption protects sensitive information, such as your login credentials, credit card details, and personal messages, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.

2.2. Hiding Your IP Address

When you connect to the internet without a VPN, your IP address (Internet Protocol address) is exposed. This unique identifier can reveal your geographic location, internet service provider, and potentially even your identity. Websites and online services use your IP address to track your activity, personalize content, and serve targeted ads.

How it works: A VPN masks your real IP address by assigning you an IP address from one of its own secure servers. This makes it appear as though you are browsing the internet from the server's location, not your actual physical location.

Why it’s important: Hiding your IP address protects your anonymity and privacy while browsing the web, preventing websites, advertisers, and malicious parties from tracking your movements or collecting personal information.

2.3. Protecting Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks (found in coffee shops, airports, hotels, etc.) are often unsecured, meaning hackers can easily intercept your data and launch man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. These attacks allow cybercriminals to read or manipulate your internet traffic, including login credentials and financial details.

How it works: A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, even on unsecured networks, ensuring that hackers can’t access your data while you’re using public Wi-Fi.

Why it’s important: By securing your connection, a VPN prevents hackers from stealing sensitive information, such as your passwords and credit card numbers, while you browse, shop, or work online.

2.4. Avoiding Tracking by ISPs and Advertisers

Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) can track your online activity, including the websites you visit, the content you view, and the services you use. This information can be sold to advertisers or shared with government agencies. Additionally, websites and advertisers use tracking technologies, like cookies and tracking pixels, to monitor your browsing habits and show targeted ads.

How it works: When you use a VPN, your traffic is encrypted and routed through a secure server, preventing your ISP from monitoring your activity. The VPN also blocks tracking scripts and cookies that websites and advertisers use to track your behavior.

Why it’s important: A VPN helps you maintain online anonymity, ensuring that your browsing history is not tracked or sold to third parties. This reduces unwanted targeted ads and prevents your personal data from being used for marketing purposes.

2.5. Bypassing Censorship and Geo-Restrictions

Many countries, companies, and even schools place restrictions on what you can access on the internet. For example, in some regions, popular social media sites like Facebook or Twitter are blocked, or certain streaming services may restrict access to content based on your geographic location (e.g., Netflix content varies by country).

How it works: A VPN allows you to connect to a server in a different country, bypassing geo-restrictions and censorship. This makes it appear as though you are browsing from the country where the content is available, allowing you to access blocked websites or streaming services.

Why it’s important: If you live in a country with strict internet censorship or travel to a country where certain websites are blocked, a VPN gives you the freedom to access the open internet without restrictions.

2.6. Preventing DDoS Attacks

A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a type of cyberattack where the attacker floods a server or network with massive amounts of traffic, causing it to slow down or crash. This is often used in cyberbullying or online gaming scenarios, where a player or website is targeted with overwhelming traffic to disrupt their activities.

How it works: A VPN hides your real IP address and routes your traffic through a secure server, preventing attackers from identifying your device or network. This makes it difficult for cybercriminals to launch a successful DDoS attack against you.

Why it’s important: By protecting your real IP address, a VPN helps safeguard you from malicious attacks and ensures that your online presence remains secure.

3. Additional VPN Security Features to Consider

While encryption and IP masking are the core features of a VPN, many modern VPNs come with additional security features to enhance your protection:

3.1. Kill Switch

A kill switch automatically disconnects your device from the internet if the VPN connection drops unexpectedly, ensuring that your real IP address isn’t exposed.

3.2. DNS Leak Protection

DNS (Domain Name System) leaks can expose your real IP address even when using a VPN. DNS leak protection ensures that your DNS queries are routed through the VPN server, preventing any leaks.

3.3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Some VPNs offer multi-factor authentication (MFA), requiring an additional form of verification (such as a code sent to your phone) to access your account. This provides an extra layer of protection in case your VPN account is compromised.

3.4. Ad and Malware Blocking

Many VPNs offer built-in features that block ads, trackers, and malware from accessing your device. This helps enhance security by preventing harmful or intrusive content from reaching you.

4. Conclusion

A VPN is one of the most effective tools for protecting your online privacy and security. By encrypting your data, masking your IP address, and preventing tracking, VPNs give you greater control over your online activities. Whether you’re using public Wi-Fi, bypassing geo-restrictions, or safeguarding sensitive data, a VPN ensures that your information remains private and secure.

In an age where digital threats are becoming more sophisticated, a VPN is an essential tool for anyone who values privacy and security. Whether you're browsing, shopping online, or using public networks, a VPN provides peace of mind knowing your data is protected from prying eyes.

1hq4fww,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN_recommenders/comments/1hq4fww/how_vpns_protect_your_online_privacy_and_security/,"How VPNs Protect Your Online Privacy and Security
","In today’s interconnected world, where we rely heavily on the internet for work, communication, and entertainment, protecting our online privacy and security has never been more important. From hackers targeting public Wi-Fi networks to governments and companies tracking your online activity, threats to personal privacy are everywhere. This is where VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) come into play. VPNs are powerful tools designed to protect your privacy and secure your online activity. In this post, we’ll explain how VPNs work and the key ways they help safeguard your personal information and enhance your online security.

1. What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates an encrypted, secure connection between your device and the internet. It routes your internet traffic through a remote server, masking your real IP address and encrypting your data. This makes it harder for third parties, such as hackers, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or even government agencies, to monitor your online activities or steal your personal information.

2. Key Ways VPNs Protect Your Online Privacy and Security

2.1. Encrypting Your Internet Connection

The main function of a VPN is to encrypt your internet traffic, which ensures that no one can intercept and read your data. Whether you’re sending an email, making an online purchase, or accessing a website, a VPN scrambles your data so that even if it’s intercepted, it remains unreadable.

How it works: VPNs use powerful encryption protocols, such as AES-256-bit encryption, to secure your data. This encryption is so strong that it is virtually impossible for hackers or any third parties to decipher the information.

Why it’s important: Encryption protects sensitive information, such as your login credentials, credit card details, and personal messages, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.

2.2. Hiding Your IP Address

When you connect to the internet without a VPN, your IP address (Internet Protocol address) is exposed. This unique identifier can reveal your geographic location, internet service provider, and potentially even your identity. Websites and online services use your IP address to track your activity, personalize content, and serve targeted ads.

How it works: A VPN masks your real IP address by assigning you an IP address from one of its own secure servers. This makes it appear as though you are browsing the internet from the server's location, not your actual physical location.

Why it’s important: Hiding your IP address protects your anonymity and privacy while browsing the web, preventing websites, advertisers, and malicious parties from tracking your movements or collecting personal information.

2.3. Protecting Your Data on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks (found in coffee shops, airports, hotels, etc.) are often unsecured, meaning hackers can easily intercept your data and launch man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. These attacks allow cybercriminals to read or manipulate your internet traffic, including login credentials and financial details.

How it works: A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, even on unsecured networks, ensuring that hackers can’t access your data while you’re using public Wi-Fi.

Why it’s important: By securing your connection, a VPN prevents hackers from stealing sensitive information, such as your passwords and credit card numbers, while you browse, shop, or work online.

2.4. Avoiding Tracking by ISPs and Advertisers

Your ISP (Internet Service Provider) can track your online activity, including the websites you visit, the content you view, and the services you use. This information can be sold to advertisers or shared with government agencies. Additionally, websites and advertisers use tracking technologies, like cookies and tracking pixels, to monitor your browsing habits and show targeted ads.

How it works: When you use a VPN, your traffic is encrypted and routed through a secure server, preventing your ISP from monitoring your activity. The VPN also blocks tracking scripts and cookies that websites and advertisers use to track your behavior.

Why it’s important: A VPN helps you maintain online anonymity, ensuring that your browsing history is not tracked or sold to third parties. This reduces unwanted targeted ads and prevents your personal data from being used for marketing purposes.

2.5. Bypassing Censorship and Geo-Restrictions

Many countries, companies, and even schools place restrictions on what you can access on the internet. For example, in some regions, popular social media sites like Facebook or Twitter are blocked, or certain streaming services may restrict access to content based on your geographic location (e.g., Netflix content varies by country).

How it works: A VPN allows you to connect to a server in a different country, bypassing geo-restrictions and censorship. This makes it appear as though you are browsing from the country where the content is available, allowing you to access blocked websites or streaming services.

Why it’s important: If you live in a country with strict internet censorship or travel to a country where certain websites are blocked, a VPN gives you the freedom to access the open internet without restrictions.

Need advice.","So I've always been petite and extremely confident with my body. I could eat basically anything and never gained weight but I never was a super unhealthy eater anyway. I always sat at around 100 to 115 lbs once I reached my max height. I gained a normal amount for my pregnancy and was just all belly. Now about a year and a half ago I blew up like a balloon and was at 178 I didn't even notice until I stopped fitting into my pants. My body type is pear shaped I've always had a larger behind and small chest. I've also always had that little lower belly fat layer with the rest of my belly being flat. So my pants kept fitting for a while since they were a bit bigger anyway. 
Recently I've gone back down a few sizes in pants and been asked if I've lost weight. So I'm guessing I have lost some weight and may not be 170lbs I will edit when I check my weight later at my aunts house since I don't have a scale. I was living a very sedentary lifestyle for a while so i think I've started losing weight because I've been moving more, and trying to eat less carbs and sugars. I still love to have coffee in the morning and I just can't bring myself to drink it black. 

My main questions are could being more sedentary really make me gain that much weight? In such a short time? I wasn't super active before that, I didn't excersise or anything I just was more social and did more rather than sitting in my house all day. I also hardly drank water then and now I drink so much more but I thought that was good for losing weight?

 How can I get my arms slimmer without them bulking up too much? I have some 5 lb dumbells that I am gonna start using to try and get rid of the chubbyness of my arms. Is that enough weight though?

Should I try zepbound along with the food and exercise changes? I've been walking a lot more and have a step counter trying to hit my 10k everyday. I don't eat fast food, and do eat Steak,or porkchops  about 5 times a week with a side of steamed broccoli 
And rice but am thinking of cutting out the rice or lowering the amount of it I eat. 

Any alternatives to coffee with cold foam and sugar? I really just can't drink it black I can't stand the taste but I definitely have a coffee addiction in the mornings.

I’ve had previous issues with my girlfriend about meeting up with her ex to study at coffee shops, school, etc without telling me. I would find out because of either slip ups or me calling her to find out she’s with her ex.

When I first met the ex, we were at this bar where he was with a few of his friends and Iw as with my GF. The entire night his friends were basically interrogating me and asking me really hard questions blah blah blah. When we were going home I told my Gf, “so your ex is still into you huh” and she responded “Yes”.

Despite this, she would keep meeting with him and I would let it slide because I was confident in our relationship.

Then this previous summer, they both ended up getting a seasonal job (at different places) back in their shared hometown and I stayed whereI was at. To feel more secure, I asked her to let me know if they’re ever having plans of meeting up, to which she agreed (and same deal with my ex).

Turns out, she failed to inform me more than a few times that they had hung out, gone to parties with friends, etc. She apologized over and over and I accepted. She promised it wouldn’t happen again, and I believed her.

Then a couple months ago (they’re both back in the city), I tried calling and messaging her, and only got vague replies as to what she was doing. I checked her location, and she had turned it off (this has never happened). I confronted her about this and asked what was going on. She confessed she had spent the day with her ex and even went back to his place (someone else was present) to hangout for a bit. I was furious because she had broken my trust yet again. She apologized and apologized, explained in detail what had happened (they studied together at a cafe, and then hung out with his roommate back at his apartment). It took  a lot of work, but I finally accepted her apology.

She’s explained to me multiple times before that the reason they’re still friends is because they have known each other since middle school, and they went through somewhat of a rough breakup as he had just lost his dad, turned to drinking which made my GF leave him. She feels bad about leaving him in such a rough state of life, so meeting up with him to see that he’s doing okay reassures her that she didn’t do anything wrong by leaving him. I totally understand this point of view, however it does make me uncomfortable still. Especially when going behind my back.

Forward to this Christmas, they’re both back in their hometown with family. I naturally was feeling a little bit anxious that we were so far apart and they were together. They both share the same group of friends on one night she hosted a potluck where he was invited. She told me about this, but only after I had asked if he was going to be there.

She’s back in town now, and as bad as I feel for snooping, I couldn’t help but see if there was anything she was hiding. I check her messages to find nothing suspicious, until I check her “recently deleted messages” and find almost 200 deleted messages with her ex.

I have no idea what to do, I haven’t recovered the messages to see what they say, but I don’t know how to approach this. I don’t know how to confront her by saying “hey btw, I snooped on your phone while you were asleep and found all this”

**Ingredients**:

6 large egg yolks 🥚  
¾ cup sugar 🍬  
1 cup mascarpone cheese 🧀  
1 ½ cups heavy cream 🍶  
2 cups brewed coffee (cooled) ☕  
2 tbsp coffee liqueur (optional) 🍸  
1 pack ladyfingers 🍪  
2 tbsp cocoa powder 🍫  
Dark chocolate shavings (optional for garnish) 🍫  
**Preparation Method:**

Make the custard: In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and sugar until pale and thick. Then, gently fold in the mascarpone cheese until smooth and creamy.  
Whip the cream: In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Fold it into the mascarpone mixture until everything is well combined.  
Prepare the coffee mixture: In a shallow dish, combine the brewed coffee and coffee liqueur (if using).  
Assemble the layers: Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture (don’t soak them too long, just a quick dip), then arrange them in the bottom of a 9x9-inch dish.  
Layer the cream: Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, smoothing it into an even layer. Repeat the process with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining mascarpone mixture.  
Chill: Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight if you can wait that long! 😆  
Serve: Before serving, dust the top with cocoa powder and garnish with dark chocolate shavings for that extra touch of elegance. 🍫

Recently, he crossed a line and continues to cross them. I’m unsure if I am taking this too far but people in my life are telling me it’s bad and i need to do this. 
My dad has been overbearing my entire life, he has anger issues yet denies he has them. He has screamed at my younger brother (11), myself and my mother to the point of panic attacks on multiple occasions through the years. He has locked my mother in a car, causing her a panic attack because he wanted to have “a conversation” with her. His conversations involve him telling you his opinion, and not leaving you alone until you agree with him. He rants in your face and gets very upset when you do not agree with him. Until now, nothing has ever been physical and I do believe it was a temporary lack of judgement but that doesn’t make it okay. 
I have been gathering voice memos of him yelling at people in my household for the last four months. His arguments are very childish and I believe he has something going on with his brain because he is SO bipolar.
He’s very “I’m your dad you need to respect me”. 
I’ll detail the turning point now, Two weeks ago now I had just gotten home from school, he told me he was making dinner for 5:30-6:00ish and i said okay. It was 4:40pm and i hadn’t eaten all day so i went into the kitchen and made a piece of toast. He turns around and gets very upset at me because “now i wouldn’t eat my supper”, I told him I had hardly eaten all day and was hungry. He was upset and said i just made toast to defy his authority. He said I didn’t respect him, and I said “do you give me a reason to?” he got very upset and asked what i meant, I said he treated everyone in this household like crap and I was done with it. He dropped it for a minute, visibly angry but went and did some dishes. I buttered my toast and took it to my room. 
He proceeds to storm in, asks me to apologize to him, I refuse because why should I when I’m just calling him out on his behaviour, he takes my phone, and then takes my toast. He gets mad and stalks off to go smoke.
Dinner happens, I eat all my supper wow. 
11pm now, i go in and ask him for my phone in the morning for school, telling him i don’t need it now but i do need it for that. He refuses, I tell him I am unsafe at school and need it. He gets upset and starts yelling, asking me to apologize about making the toast and apologize about what I said to him. I refuse again, and go downstairs to text my mother (who is away on business) on my grandmothers phone who lives in our basement. I detail the situation, and ask if she can confirm I can have my phone tmr morning. I stay with my grandmother for two hours because she thought he’d blow up at me again.
The next morning, I awake to screaming threats of him cutting my phone bill and turning off the electricity to my room because “I don’t deserve it”. He wakes me up at 6:20am and proceeds to walk in my room, go to the garage where the breaker panel is and for the next 30ish minutes turned one breaker off, comes to my room to see if power is off, slams the door, repeat. all while screaming at me. He finally turns the power off for the whole floor. 
He told me I wasn’t going to school until I apologized and we figured this out. I told him he was being very aggressive and i didn’t appreciate it, and that it wasn’t just something you get over. He yells and screams and we go back and forth however many times, him still insisting on me apologizing on toast. he is yelling at me to the point I am mid panic attack having to deal with and respond to him. I said something again about not respecting him and not liking the way he treats my mother, I asked him “hasn’t she asked you for a divorce multiple times? why are you still here we all clearly don’t want you here”, he freaks out and gives me my phone back, it’s about 7:30 at this point. 
I grab it and don’t let go, he grabs for my phone, i turn and he grabs my arm and is fighting me for my phone for a solid 30 seconds. 4 of my press on nails came off in the process as well as me knocking over a candle that almost lit my room on fire. 
i gather my stuff up, him still yelling at me, i tell him i’m not doing this right now and I would be leaving and walking to my friends house up the road. He proceeds to stand in my doorway and not leave despite me telling him to get out and let me leave, I even threatened to jump out the window. He finally gets distracted by my grandmother coming upstairs and leaves, giving me an opportunity to get out of my room. I get my stuff together, he is telling me i’m not going to school and i’m not going to work and he would call my boss personally and tell them i couldn’t come in (he has threatened and done this in the past with a different job). I told him no, I would be going to both school and work and if he tried to pick me up I wouldn’t get in his car. 
I went to my friends house, after him accusing me of manipulating the whole situation and making him out to be the bad guy every time. 
I told my mom all that happened and she told me or he showed up to call the police. He did show up, but I had told my manager and she got me out early. I stayed the night at a friends and the day after my mom got home and we sat down and had a conversation with my dad about his behaviour and he had gone too far and it was time for a divorce. 
He seemed like he had no idea it was coming and tried to say he just wanted to fix it. When a pattern has been going on for almost 16 years like this, it is time to end it.
He is currently living in a room in my basement and is only supposed to enter through the garage door and use the coffee maker and microwave in his room to cook unless he has cleared it with us first. 
My father doesn’t contribute financially much, he is extremely unreliable in this department. My mother has had to pay his bills for him, he only pays the electric and gas bill and my mother pays the rest. He doesn’t make enough to afford rent where we’re located, so he is unable to move out (his words, not mine). He had texted my mom and told her hes not leaving the house until she has bought him out, for the record SHE PAYS THE MORTGAGE HE PAYS NOTHING. I’m not too sure how that whole situation works but what I do know is I need him out. I am considering reaching out to my guidance counsellor about getting cps involved because quite honestly this is affecting me so much. It’s not physical abuse and I know people have it so much worse out there but it’s not fair that I have to come home to this everyday. It’s like he has manic episodes or something I don’t know who he is anymore. When he leaves the house he is a different person, everyone loves him and he’s so friendly. 
He’s been sending me text messages too which are basically begging me to talk to him and hes sending me tiktok’s that are getting weird. 
my mom is scared of putting her foot down so me doing this is the only way he will be leaving. I’m scared that CPS won’t help me fast enough because I’m almost 17. 
I know Ive left a lot of details out, so feel free to ask any clarifying questions. Would CPS help? Is it severe enough they’d even help? How should I go about this? Should I do it? ",1,1735611660.0,emotionalabuse,0,1.0,False

My life was spent mostly studying for grades and med school. I was pressured by parents and a desire to prove to my parents that I was good enough to be a doctor so I never dated anyone. 

In my program all of my coresidents we have a friendly coworker relationship but all of them have boyfriend, married or kids so they have their responsibilities and social circle.

In the first 3-4 months of residency I was learning how to be an intern and studying for step 3.

I love doinng and learning to be an intern resident.


Then in I worked with another resident who was kind, beautiful and we shared a lot of interests. But she had a complicated past with a kid and being a single mom. I initially had feelings for her but knew that she deserved better and it would be best to be friends
So I would try to hangout at work when we were at different rotations just because I felt the closest to her. She was always nice, hugged me. I gave her a Christmas present of her favorite coffee and some cutesy stuff because I felt that she had a lot on her plate. I texted to hangout with her during Christmas but she wanted to be with her family so fair. I apologized for being forward and disrupting her family time.

After meeting that other resident I felt like there was a hole punched in a dam where I started feeling lonely because of a lack of romantic partner and a deep friendship where you can just talk about random shit or just pop by their house just to chat.

Another issue arose when my best friend from med school in another residency program texted a couple of weeks ago saying how were things going. We hadn’t kept in touch because of being with residency. I was in the lonely spiral and admitted my past feelings for her and I apologized for my emotional cowardice and wanted to be friends and she did initially say we could be friends no problem. 

Then on Christmas I tried texting to see if she was free just to talk for fun because I was bored working at the hospital. She said she was with family so fair. I just left it there

On Saturday I tried texting to just to keep in touch and then she said I was just hoping we could be casual friends. I have a boyfriend and I think we should not be so connected. I was stupid and tried to call just to clear stuff up. She said that she was with family and couldn’t chat. I texted an apology


How do I not let my loneliness rule me and make me day and do stupid shit?

Like this has gone from minor thought in the back of my mind to being a consuming thought that I am trying to fight back.

I'm trying to get my story out there cause at 30 years old I'm the only person I know like this, and wanting to understand more about it. 

The first time I got an ocular migraine I was 18, living away from my family and thought I was forsure dying. Blindness/aura in one eye, unbelievable pain I'm my head and constant vomiting, for 4 to sometimes 16 hours. For 12 years I suffered with these and at almost 31 I think I've narrowed it down to everything that causes these for me.

It's basically stimulants. I was very addicted to cigarettes, coffee/energy drinks, experimented with illicit drugs, and after weening off all these things I rarely get them. I did the closest thing to an elimination diet that I could and as I would drink energy drinks or eat salami or breads with nitrates I realized I would react extremely violently to these. The last migraine I had I threw up so much I was dehydrated to the point my entire abdomen was cramping for hours.

I'll list out every ingredient that's made me feel these affects in hoping that it helps someone else. Keep in mind I went 12 years with these extremely common things in our society not realizing it was killing me. I'm hoping I can meet more people like this and talk to more doctors or anyone that knows what's going on, because as I'm sure everyone here knows, true migraine information is kept incredibly suppressed, or so it seems. It's crazier because when I asked a doctor about what to do they just said ""drink more caffeine, it's good for migraines"" and one ingredient I'm allergic to listed as a vitamin! The food system in our country is f***ed and I feel like it's causing most of our issues... anyways please share what you guys wish! Here's the ""allergen"" list:

- Caffeine
- Nicotine
- Chocolate (has Caffeine and beta-phenylethylamine, known to cause headaches)
- B vitamins (B1, B6, B12, thiamin mononitrate* is found in most products that contain pork or eggs. It's in most pepperonis, sausages, bacon, breads and shelf snacks as a preservative. If you want these look for uncured meats and foods that use sodium phosphates instead. This is salt based instead of petroleum based 🤮)

Trader Joes and carob chocolates have been my friend through this. Opted for swiss water process decaf coffee when I wanted coffee... I'll continue to add more as I think about it ❤️

For the next few weeks I'm going to be coming into Manhattan from The Bronx to work on several projects. Normally I work remotely but I have a ton of stuff going on and it will be best for me to just position myself in town 4-5 days a week to be available for meetings, do site visits, keep away from domestic distractions etc. 

Before the pandemic I had a collection of places that I could drop in to work; libraries, open dinning halls, coffee shops, atriums, etc. But most of them have closed or transformed. 

I fully realize that people may not want to share their awesome private, quiet spot with free wifi. But If anyone could share such a place I would be deeply appreciative.

Rayhomme

p.s. I appreciate that I should be thinking about renting an office or coworking space. My business doesn't warrant a full time space. And, for whatever reason, I prefer the fractious energy of a public space to the rented privacy of a Co-working space. ",1,1735611627.0,AskNYC,0,1.0,False

1hq4bjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1hq4bjh/do_i_kick_my_dad_out_officially/,Do I kick my dad out officially?,"Let me preface this by saying i’m F, almost 17 and my father has acted this way almost my entire life. Recently, he crossed a line and continues to cross them. I’m unsure if I am taking this too far but people in my life are telling me it’s bad and i need to do this. 

My dad has been overbearing my entire life, he has anger issues yet denies he has them. He has screamed at my younger brother (11), myself and my mother to the point of panic attacks on multiple occasions through the years. He has locked my mother in a car, causing her a panic attack because he wanted to have “a conversation” with her. His conversations involve him telling you his opinion, and not leaving you alone until you agree with him. He rants in your face and gets very upset when you do not agree with him. Until now, nothing has ever been physical and I do believe it was a temporary lack of judgement but that doesn’t make it okay. 
I have been gathering voice memos of him yelling at people in my household for the last four months. His arguments are very childish and I believe he has something going on with his brain because he is SO bipolar.

He’s very “I’m your dad you need to respect me”. 
I’ll detail the turning point now, Two weeks ago now I had just gotten home from school, he told me he was making dinner for 5:30-6:00ish and i said okay. It was 4:40pm and i hadn’t eaten all day so i went into the kitchen and made a piece of toast. He turns around and gets very upset at me because “now i wouldn’t eat my supper”, I told him I had hardly eaten all day and was hungry. He was upset and said i just made toast to defy his authority. He said I didn’t respect him, and I said “do you give me a reason to?” he got very upset and asked what i meant, I said he treated everyone in this household like crap and I was done with it. He dropped it for a minute, visibly angry but went and did some dishes. I buttered my toast and took it to my room. 
He proceeds to storm in, asks me to apologize to him, I refuse because why should I when I’m just calling him out on his behaviour, he takes my phone, and then takes my toast. He gets mad and stalks off to go smoke.

Dinner happens, I eat all my supper wow. 
11pm now, i go in and ask him for my phone in the morning for school, telling him i don’t need it now but i do need it for that. He refuses, I tell him I am unsafe at school and need it. He gets upset and starts yelling, asking me to apologize about making the toast and apologize about what I said to him. I refuse again, and go downstairs to text my mother (who is away on business) on my grandmothers phone who lives in our basement. I detail the situation, and ask if she can confirm I can have my phone tmr morning. I stay with my grandmother for two hours because she thought he’d blow up at me again.

The next morning, I awake to screaming threats of him cutting my phone bill and turning off the electricity to my room because “I don’t deserve it”. He wakes me up at 6:20am and proceeds to walk in my room, go to the garage where the breaker panel is and for the next 30ish minutes turned one breaker off, comes to my room to see if power is off, slams the door, repeat. all while screaming at me. He finally turns the power off for the whole floor. 
He told me I wasn’t going to school until I apologized and we figured this out. I told him he was being very aggressive and i didn’t appreciate it, and that it wasn’t just something you get over. He yells and screams and we go back and forth however many times, him still insisting on me apologizing on toast. he is yelling at me to the point I am mid panic attack having to deal with and respond to him. I said something again about not respecting him and not liking the way he treats my mother, I asked him “hasn’t she asked you for a divorce multiple times? why are you still here we all clearly don’t want you here”, he freaks out and gives me my phone back, it’s about 7:30 at this point. 

I grab it and don’t let go, he grabs for my phone, i turn and he grabs my arm and is fighting me for my phone for a solid 30 seconds. 4 of my press on nails came off in the process as well as me knocking over a candle that almost lit my room on fire. 
i gather my stuff up, him still yelling at me, i tell him i’m not doing this right now and I would be leaving and walking to my friends house up the road. He proceeds to stand in my doorway and not leave despite me telling him to get out and let me leave, I even threatened to jump out the window. He finally gets distracted by my grandmother coming upstairs and leaves, giving me an opportunity to get out of my room. I get my stuff together, he is telling me i’m not going to school and i’m not going to work and he would call my boss personally and tell them i couldn’t come in (he has threatened and done this in the past with a different job). I told him no, I would be going to both school and work and if he tried to pick me up I wouldn’t get in his car.

I went to my friends house, after him accusing me of manipulating the whole situation and making him out to be the bad guy every time. 

I told my mom all that happened and she told me or he showed up to call the police. He did show up, but I had told my manager and she got me out early. I stayed the night at a friends and the day after my mom got home and we sat down and had a conversation with my dad about his behaviour and he had gone too far and it was time for a divorce. 
He seemed like he had no idea it was coming and tried to say he just wanted to fix it. When a pattern has been going on for almost 16 years like this, it is time to end it.

He is currently living in a room in my basement and is only supposed to enter through the garage door and use the coffee maker and microwave in his room to cook unless he has cleared it with us first. 
My father doesn’t contribute financially much, he is extremely unreliable in this department. My mother has had to pay his bills for him, he only pays the electric and gas bill and my mother pays the rest. He doesn’t make enough to afford rent where we’re located, so he is unable to move out (his words, not mine). He had texted my mom and told her hes not leaving the house until she has bought him out, for the record SHE PAYS THE MORTGAGE HE PAYS NOTHING. I’m not too sure how that whole situation works but what I do know is I need him out. I am considering reaching out to my guidance counsellor about getting cps involved because quite honestly this is affecting me so much. It’s not physical abuse and I know people have it so much worse out there but it’s not fair that I have to come home to this everyday. It’s like he has manic episodes or something I don’t know who he is anymore. When he leaves the house he is a different person, everyone loves him and he’s so friendly. I called him a narcissist and a manipulator and that’s all I see in him. But at the same time hes my dad and I have nothing to compare it to as this is my life. Am I overreacting?

He’s been sending me text messages too which are basically begging me to talk to him and hes sending me tiktok’s that are getting weird. 

my mom is scared of putting her foot down so me doing this is the only way he will be leaving. I’m scared that CPS won’t help me fast enough because I’m almost 17. 

I know I’ve left a lot of details out, so feel free to ask any clarifying questions. Would CPS help? Is it severe enough they’d even help? How should I go about this? Should I do it? ",1,1735611553.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

I'm going to DL training soon, and I'm trying to plan as well as possible for not having any meals provided. If you have input from your training experience, I would LOVE any tips.  
  
Breakfast: I'm least worried about this meal--I've heard to bring Keurig pods for coffee, and I know it's a possibility that the hotel might provide breakfast. I'm going to buy lots of bagels, fruit, protein bars etc. from the grocery store for breakfast.

Lunch: Is there a lunch break during the training day during which we should plan to bring a packed lunch? Or is there a cafeteria on Delta's campus where we can buy food? Can we go off campus? If so, do you have recommendations for cheap places nearby?

Dinners: I think I'm most concerned about dinners because this is where it will be difficult to not be able to cook, and the cost of prepared meals, even from the grocery store, could add up fast. I'm anticipating getting lots of bagged salad kits from the grocery store, having a loaf of bread and peanut butter and jelly on hand...but I'm definitely concerned about not having a way to cook. Would it be useful to get a HotLogic for the hotel room? I'm guessing none of the training hotels are ""extended stay"" type ones with kitchenettes...any and all helpful hints and advice welcome!",1,1735611498.0,cabincrewcareers,5,0.67,False

Here is my list of what's allowed, incase anyone could use some inspiration:

\- essential hygiene & cleaning supplies  
\- haircuts  
\- replacement housewares  
\- replacement phone (if needed)  
\- replacement shoes & socks  
\- replacement clothing (must be thrifted)  
\- groceries and snacks out (no coffee/Starbucks drinks and any meals out must be with friends)

I'm a little nervous because I definitely resorted to window (and occasional) shopping in 2024. I felt a little depressed realizing I didn't enjoy it as much anymore, but it is a habit I'm now faced with replacing. I want to get back into reading but my attention span has waned over time. So we'll see how that goes....

I'm happy to say I did a lot of decluttering this past year. Most of it was fast fashion I had accumulated during the pandemic, and I ended up feeling guilty throwing it away. Though I wore most of it, it was a waste and I'm now planning to cut it out permanently. I agree with youtubers who say it's better to buy fewer high quality items because it adds up.

I had some, said so, and declined. She asked, ""Do you smoke anything else?"" To which I replied, ""Weed."" She said ""Do you have anything to smoke out of?"" I said, ""A one hitter."" We got good and lit. Talked about life a bit. Listened to some tunes. She gave me a bud, then she dropped me about 30 miles down the road.

And there I stayed until right before dark. About 3 1/2 hours. A dude I could barely understand picked me up. He drove me about 10 miles down the road. Dropped me off in the middle of nothing. A few houses up the road and not much else.

I walked about 1 1/2 miles to e rest stop back the way I had come so I could charge my phone. It was so dark I couldn't see the road I was on. I had to roll up my pant legs to cross a stream to get from the road to the rest area.  Made it. 

Charged my phone because it needed it and a night with no entertainment and just my thoughts seemed horrifying. 

Setup my tent, climbed in. Made my bed. Burned one. Proceeded to stay on reddit until I fell asleep.

Got up this morning. Topped off the phone. Shaved. Proceeded to cross I-10 on foot with full gear. 

I hitchhiked for 4 hours with no luck. I was planning on getting somewhere and getting some coffee and something to eat. But alas, not one single car stopped. I was slowly smoking my last 4 for $1.29 cigars. I was getting light headed from not eating at this point.

An old addage hit me, 'If the interstate doesn't work take the highway.' So I start looking at maps. There ain't shit around me. Every road is going into Mobile from here. Couldn't go another way if I wanted to.

Then I realize one, Alabama has always sucked hitchhiking, I have no reason to go back to Florida, I got to New Orleans on a dream ride of hotels and bus trips I didn't pay for, I am out looking for work...

Maybe I should go the other way. I've hitched out of northern states in January. Fuck it. I'm turning around and then going north.

I picked up my gear. I wakk back down the way and across I-10. I go back to the rest stop. I say hi to a random guy as I walk up. He goes his way, I go drop my gear. I hit the vending machine for something to eat. Cookies it is. As my bag of cookies drops I hear, ""Young man."" I look over. It's dude I said hi to in the way in. He says, ""I'll give you a ride to the next exit. That's my white truck over there and you can put your stuff in the back and climb in."" I give him a heartfelt 'Thank You', grab my stuff, and we head back to the ramp I was stuck on yesterday. 

Dude buys me a meal, takes me to a gas station and buys me cigarettes, and drops me off. I hung out under a no loitering sign charging my phone for a couple hours, hit the bathroom,  and went to setup camp.

I'm about to burn one and watch Despicable Me 4, and The Bee Keeper.

I've seen this before. Try going one way with zero luck. Turn around and boom! Things just fall into place fast.",41,1735611188.0,vagabond,3,1.0,False
1hq46lv,https://i.redd.it/3b8w0svze3ae1.jpeg,"Oh my gosh, could you even imagine if I got this skin when it was released?","I mean, just look at how darn CUTE she looks in her little coffee shop outfit. And her hair is all done up so cutesy. There's a line on her crotch that almost looks that it's outlining her pussy. But that's not quite where the pussy starts, so I guess it's just a coincidence. But could you even imagine if Blizzard would start detailing the definition of their girls’ pussies? I think they did that for Juno during her playtests and removed when she was released; but that was because she has such a tight bodysuit so it makes sense for her. What does that say about Sojourn's skinny jeans in her barista skin? I mean, her butt is pretty well defined in it so maybe it is tight enough around her pussy that you would see the definition of it.

I've been playing a lot of Sojourn late season 13 into now and I don't see a need to play anyone else. I always liked playing Sojourn but I didn't realize how much easier the game can be if you just play a character that just shoots a guy in the head and it does big damage.

That's not to say that I think that that's all Sojourn is about. In fact I get a little annoyed when people say Sojourn “plays like a hitscan” despite the fact that she's a projectile hero. It's like saying Soldier is a projectile hero just because his big burst damage ability happens to be projectile. If anything both of them are hybrid, but I'd like to see you try to 1v1 a Pharah and try to tell me Sojourn plays like a hitscan.

My go-to skins have been Ultrawatch and Captain Chase. And it's for the simple reason that I don't like her white hair. And while the afro is kinda growing on me, I'd much perfer her default hairstyle but in black; just like how it is on her Runner skin. But oh my gosh, her hair in the barista skin is so cute! The bun in the back with the strands of hair hanging down onto her face! It's the best of everything. The only thing I don't really like about the skin the those tiny cyber panels on her cheeks under her eyes. I think that this would've actually been the prefect skin for her to have a less robotic body. It is just apart of her character though so it's not that I made it that much. But having her have normal arms would've been nice. At least for this skin.

One thing that I've started to notice is that I just also kind of like the coffee aesthetic in general. But I really don't like coffee. I think it tastes like dirt, which might be kind of true if you think about it. But I've pretty recently learned that when you're a baby the only tastes that you naturally like are sweet and salty. Every other taste needs to be acquired. And you can actually acquire any taste if you just keep throwing your head at the wall trying it over and over and over. I wanted to try acquiring the taste of coffee since I already love tea so much and oh my goodness is it not easy.

My first time trying I just took a cup of black coffee and gave it a taste. Hated it. Put a ton of coffee creamer in it. Still awful. Gave up and dumped the coffee.

I had another try with a similar coffee build but what really made me wanna try again was using a cappuccino keurig pod that my family got for Christmas. But as you could guess the tries were pretty much the same. I took a few sips and then would give up. The best I had it was finishing about half of an 8oz cup I had. But the taste wasn't getting acquired in the way I thought it would.

Maybe I was going about it in the wrong way anyway. I mean, I drink about 2-3 cups of 12oz cups of tea pre day, and even then it's hard for me to drink straight black tea. So filling coffee with a bunch of cream and sugar probably won't help me acquire the taste.

But I've also heard that if you make coffee the right way there isn't any bitterness to it at all.

Hm, come to think of it I guess that means I've never really had real coffee before.

There's kind of this idea that what if every person's taste was different. That is to say that somethings just taste worse or better to people because they were both that way.

I don't really believe that. I think taste is the same for everyone, it's just that some people are used to certain tastes. Because they've acquired it in their lifetime.

And, you know, this skin made me realize something. I had be contemplating buying the battle pass just for the Sojourn Cozy skin. I kept thinking about all the other stuff in the pass and how maybe it would be worth it and if I even liked the skin in the first place. If it was the Barista skin in the battle pass I wouldn't even have to think about it. I would get it just for that skin. And that just goes to show that the choice is easy when the skin doesn't cover her butt.

One thing I also just thought of is if Sojourn walked at a coffee shop she could use her breastmilk to put into the coffee. And now I'm thinking about wheather or not Sojourn has robo boobs. I already made a post talking about if Sojourn's butt is made of metal and I think the common consensus is that it's not. I think I could lean either way on it, but I do think her butt is real. And I don't see why her boobs would be robotic. Unless she herself wants to lean into the breastmilk part of it and get bags (because she's Canadian) of milk installed into her chest and dispense milk out of her nipples. 

What was I talking about again? Oh yeah, that barista skin is good.",16,1735611135.0,OverwatchCirclejerk,2,0.94,False

I ended up not going to the ER and started a low fat diet the next day to prevent further attacks. I started making calls and setting up appointments. the scans showed stones in my GB and liver damage. my surgery was this morning. it went better than I thought. from my last attack in September to today I only had 2 mild attacks (caffeine intake) avoid coffee or energy drinks.

So I share my experience here. The post was like:

I used to have a protein rich meal in the evening because I always felt tired as a result of the over processing brain we have. And that meal would help me become a fresh person again and work for another few hours


This was my routine for years...until..I had a 48 hours water fasting for unrelated health reasons. And then I noticed I became quite focused. I didn't even wanted to check social media.

To retry it but ofcourse not that harsh, I have been eating one meal at around 6pm. The rest of the day just water, tea, supplements and salt. And one cup of black coffee in the morning. I'm quite energetic and focused.

And I ended with please talk to your doctor before trying any diet. 

So if they think this is scary and should get removed, I share it. There is no alternative medication in this diet. You still take whatever u take during the day. You just remove food.

1hq3xym,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hq3xym/aitah_for_wanting_to_invite_a_friend_over_to_a/,AITAH for wanting to invite a friend over to a flat I share with my ex? ,"My ex and I were together for almost 7 years. In all honesty, we probably fell out of love maybe about 1.5 years ago but we were both in denial about it and our lives were very intertwined. About 4 weeks ago, they asked for a ""hall pass"" to sleep with someone else once. Long story short, we ended up mutually realising we don't want to be together anymore and broke up about a week ago and we agreed to stay friends. They are now dating the person they hooked up with and my ex spends a lot of time at their new gf flat.

Back in November, we re-signed a tenancy agreement for our studio flat because we did not foreshadow we would break up a couple of weeks later so we are now stuck in a studio flat together for another year and honestly, neither of us can afford to move out right now. 

The whole situation has made me feel very depressed and worthless over the past week until I ended up unexpectedly meeting a very nice guy. In no way, shape or form was I looking for a boyfriend and I did not plan to meet anyone. I just happened to stumble upon them, and realised we have a lot of things in common. We both like each other's personalities but agreed to not rush into anything and we're currently staying friends, and I don't think I'm ready for another relationship just yet.
Because I've only just met the guy, I haven't explained to him my current living situation, partially because I'm embarrassed, and partially because I think they would freak out about me living with my ex because honeslty, I think I'd feel weird if the situation was reversed. 

During our break up talk, my ex made a joke which went along the lines of ""oh let me know if you want the flat to yourself"". They made this joke before I ever met the nice guy. Me and the nice guy have only hanged out once so far and I don't want to sleep with him because I barely know the guy. The nice guy is currently living with their family because these days, renting by yourself is expensive, which forced them to move back home. 

The issue at hand is, I mentioned to my ex that it would be nice to have a movie night with the nice guy whilst my ex is having sleep overs with their new girlfriend. I'm currently broke after Christmas and cannot afford to go out and spend money as I please so the only reason why I want to invite them over, is because I genuinely don't have the money to go out and I don't want nice guy to be paying for me because I don't want to be a leach. 

My ex said that they do not feel comfortable with me bringing anyone over to the flat whilst they're not there. I have also clarified if I'm allowed to bring a work colleague who is a girl over for coffee and a chat and they also said that they are uncomfortable with the idea of me bringing a girl friend over whilst they are not here. I told them I understand their opinion and I will respect their wishes and I will not invite anyone over to our flat. They then asked me if I was upset. I responded honestly and told them I am a little upset but I understand and respect their decision. My ex is now upset that I'm upset and they said that I'm invalidating their feelings even though I agreed to not invite anyone over. They ended up getting an uber back to their new girlfriends flat because they were upset. 

For context, when we just started dating, my ex's mum helped us out financially because we were both students. The whole time, I had always been working and contributing financially by paying the water and electricity bills, as well as all the food and any items my ex wanted to purchase. My ex has not been able to work at all in the 7 years we have been together because of their mental health struggles so their only support was a student loan, their mum and me. Because I've gotten a better job over the past year, I started to fully pay all of our bills, including the rent, my ex's mum is only helping us when we do not have food in the fridge or if my ex wants to buy something for themself. I mentioned to my ex that I am currently paying all the rent and bills and I am not even able to bring a friend over for coffee but they threw it in my face, that their mum has been supporting me and let me go on holiday with them and insinuated that I am in debt to my ex because of all the help and holiday I received from my ex's mum. 

I understand that they do not want me to bring over some random guy I've just met, but what I don't understand is why I cannot bring a work colleague for a cup of coffee whilst my ex is not home. 

Am I the asshole for wanting to invite my friend over?

Basically, what is your opinion on a guy coming over to you in the gym, coffee shop, shopping centre etc and starting a convo with the intention of getting your instagram? 

I’m not talking about creepy old dude, gross cocky pickup artists etc. I’m talking looks matching guy to looks matching girl. 

My situation, 

I noticed this girl at the gym, real pretty, in real good shape and exactly my type. I’ve caught her looking at me a few times, she’s caught me and we’ve had like extended periods of eye contact with a few nervous smiles. 

The weirdest thing is, now I’ve seen her at the gym I’m seeing her literally everywhere! When I get coffee, when I go shopping, at the park etc. 

Would it be weird if I were to just go try speak to her in any of those situations? 

I’ve had mixed opinions from different ladies that I work with, family, friends etc. Some saying to go speak to her, some saying quote “there is not a single situation where a woman ever wants to be approached by a guy ever”. I will say all the girls I’ve spoken to under 30 say no, all the girls over 30 have said yes. 

Thing is, I know I’m not the worst looking. I’m 6’5, gymrat, look after my hair, nice clothes etc. Im only 27 and really don’t mess about with the one night stand stuff. Would be cool getting to know a girl that’s into the same stuff as me haha. ",0,1735609918.0,AskWomenNoCensor,10,0.36,False

I am not sure what to say here. It would be nice to find someone to cuddle with. Be it a once time thing or a long term cuddle buddy. It would be nice to just cuddle and chat or maybe nap together. We can also watch movies.

About me: I am French but have been living in Ireland for a long time. I live alone and have no problem hosting. I do not live far from the city center. I am about average height (174cm) and a little bit overweight. If looks matters, I have a couple of old pics on my profile and have no problem swapping more recent ones in private.

We should meet up in public before deciding if we are comfortable with each other and agreeing to cuddle. Maybe we can meet for coffee, in a park or I am open to other ideas.

I don't care about your age, where you are from or any of that.

I hope we can chat soon. Let me know if you have any questions :) ",1,1735609885.0,cuddlebuddies,1,1.0,False
1hq3qgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMCSierraEV/comments/1hq3qgc/the_range_of_the_sierra_ev_is_seriously/,The range of the Sierra EV is seriously game-changing for a road warrior.,"I do a lot of across-the-state trips, which I always enjoyed in my Lightning, but am now realizing I was a little forgiving of. Let me clarify for a sec: I mean, if I was taking my 4+ hour trips every 3 or 4 months it wouldn’t have been an issue, but I can take them as often as every 2 weeks.

With my Lightning I’d start at 100% and drive a little under two hours, top up to 80% from around 55-60% (this would only be about 15-20 minutes max; grabbing a snack or something), then finish my drive with around 40 miles of range (right around 15%; note I’m almost always going 78-80 on the highway, so efficiency be damned). I’d then do a charge the next morning to 80% which took about 50 minutes (I’d turn it into a coffee shop break), so I wouldn’t have to think about anything until my return. I’d stay for 2-3 days, then top up to 80% before my return trip, which could be 20-30 minutes depending on how much driving I had done on my trip (usually sat in my truck), then did one charging stop around the halfway point, which was typically around 30 minutes.

With my Sierra, I started at 100%. I made my whole trip and arrived with 23% left on my battery after driving 80 the whole way. This cut my drive by 30 minutes. Upon my arrival I plugged in and got dinner. 30 minutes of charging got me to 66%. I did a whole day of driving and left town at 53%. I drove almost 2 hours and have plugged in with 22% left on my charge. I’m sitting here typing this up while I wait for my dinner and plan to hit the road after a 30-40 minute dinner.

My point of sharing this is that I didn’t realize how much of a difference the ridiculous range would truly make for me. My two charging stops had absolutely nothing to do with what percentage I ended with cause I knew the range even in the 60’s was plenty to get me through large spans of the state without charging stations. This trip felt nearly identical to making it with a gas vehicle and has cut serious time out of the process. I’m really happy with my decision to go with it.",9,1735609815.0,GMCSierraEV,0,1.0,False
1hq3pmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hq3pmh/aita_for_cutting_my_mother_out_of_my_life/,AITA for cutting my mother out of my life?,"Hi long story but I was raised with guilt and obligation so am struggling with my decision of cutting g mum out of my life and am hoping u lovely people can help me.
So here goes….
I am f40 and my mum is f65. I have a partner m45 and 3 kids (f18, m14 and m13) I also have a sister f42.
So I was raised by my mum and dad with my older sister I am a fixer and am relied on by everyone to be their everything.
My dad passed away from bowel cancer about 10 or so years ago at the age of 57 that’s why he isn’t in this story.
There is a lot of back story to my mums and my relationship but this part I will tell u all about.
So for close to a year now I have been having issues with an unhinged landlord so my family and I decided we have to get out of here so we started looking for places. It’s hard given how expensive rentals are and how few there are. Anyway conversation came up of mum possibly living with us to cut costs and also her rental was full of mould. 
Side note she has lived with us before many years ago and it went to shit to put it bluntly but we are all different people now and had discussions about where we are as people etc now and it all seemed like a good idea. Also my mum is on a pension and was not even able to afford to buy a cup of coffee each week. So this arrangement would benefit her the most given she would be saving about $200 per pay check. 

In September we went to look at a brand new house to rent and another new house 2 house up both going for rent at the same time for $680 per week. I loved number 16 it was classy and so nice I would feel like a queen living there.
So anyway a few days later I had a missed call at work called back and it was the realestate they asked me which house I would like 13 or 16 I told him 16 for sure and said ok then goes into a convo about bonds first weeks rents and times etc I was like hang on did we get the house he laughed and said yes to which I started yelling oh my god jumping around my work saying thank u a million times. 
I called my mum and told her and her response “I liked 13 better it appeared bigger” I told her it wasn’t bigger and sent her both floor plans and they were identical. So I was deflated she shit my happiness down so I called my partner and with excitement told him we got the house he yelled and woohooed like I did and even got a bit emotional he was so happy. 
Well here begins the chaos. I was loving first given I didn’t have to give notice. Mum had to give notice for her house so she would move in a week after me. 
My partner and I paid the bond and the 2 weeks rent upfront and the truck to move us totalling about $5000. All good all sorted. My partner and his friends were set to move our stuff after I packed a 5 person house up. 
The day came to sign the lease on that day (friday) we had to be at the office to sign the lease by 2pm now that was cutting it fine given I had to pick up the truck that afternoon and make it to the realestate office on time because first impressions matter. My mum was meant to get the truck with my partner cos he has a broken arm and mum would be the one driving the truck. However a few days before pick up I had called mum and said look it will be easier if my partner and I get the truck saves u coming over here and rushing u just take ur time and meet us at the office to sign the lease. She asked if I could pick her up and I said no given we didn’t know if the truck would take longer with signing the rental papers etc so best if u meet us there incase we are late u can go in at 2 to meet with the realestate and apologise for us. I thought that was all ok but how wrong u was.

My partner and I mad dash get the truck drop it at the house and race to the realestate in the next town over 10 mins from us. All good we make it there with 7 mins to spare WINNING thank u universe. I txt mum we are here where are u. She says at home u can come pick me up I said no it just took me 5 mins to get a park I can’t be late to meet the realestate agent u live a 1 minute drive from here u have 7mins to get here and find a park. If I left to get her I would have been late back given going back to the car getting to her then back and finding a park. 2pm rolls in and she still isn’t here. My partner and I go in jett the agent huge smiles on our faces so happy. The agent is lovely and this couldn’t be going better. Well then in storms mum with a pissed off look on her face and looks that could kill. She barks at the agent to start over with the lease. And asks for a copy for her as well. The agent goes a photocopies it and while she is gone I said to mum tell ur face to which she shoots me a look and ignores me. 
Agent comes back and says to mum u look impressed. God damn it mum seriously. I can’t save that impression so great thank a bunch mum. 
We finish up and leave and I’m outside and I say to her what the hell was that u could t put a smile on ur face and fake it.
She yells at me that I put the realestate agent before her and I wouldn’t pick her up and I keep changing plans without consulting her and she doesn’t have enough fuel to be driving around. I was floored I said here and transferred her $30 for fuel and I told her how important this was to me to make a good first impression with the agent given she is the one that says if we get to renew our lease and as for not consulting her on changes first of all it’s my house love not urs urs is next week where u make all the decisions and I told u about the changes with the truck that in turn benefited u most. 
I left I walked away I was so angry I wanted to floor her.
Next day was moving day I will skirt over those 2 days cos not much went on.
That following weekend mum was meant to be moving so through the week I told her I will come over on my days off and help her pack while unpacking my stuff after work days. 
I went with my daughter on the Tuesday to help her pack and me and my daughter killed it with packed like demons. We took a break and went outside for a cuppa my daughter stayed inside.
Well my mum says we need to talk I said ok and she goes in on me about how unfair I am and how I put the realestate woman before her and I didn’t consider her and blah blah blah. I was gob smacked this again really. Well it turned into a fight where she acted like a child saying oh yeah it’s always my fault I’m always the bad one etc. mind u my daughter hears all of this and is shocked. I have kept the fights with mum up untill this point from her cos she was to young but she is 18 now so I was pissed she did it with my kid there but not as angry as I would have been if my daughter was still young. I got my daughter and went home and rented to my partner. My daughter and my partner both agreed her attitude sucks and what she is doing wasn’t right. 
Anyway I set that aside and the next day I went back to help her pack I know stupid me u think I would learn my lesson but no I was obligated to help. I stepped through the door and world war 3 erupted and she is screaming at me. She then tells
Me to F off and get the f out of her house. I said gladly and left I called my partner reeling and ranting.
He was shocked and just told me to take it easy and get home and we will discuss.
So I txt mum when I got home told her to find someone else to help her move cos I’m not doing that again. 
A few days before she was meant to move I txt her and asked who is helping her move she said me and my partners friends I said no my partners friends are busy had u organised this sooner we could have done something I told her to find other people. I asked her if she had hired the truck she hadn’t so my partner took her over there and signed for the truck and he told her it was $150 now and $150 when we were done mum looked at my partner and said nothing so my partner pulled out his cars and paid the $150. I told her when I found out that she will have to pay the other $150 when the truck is taken back she wasn’t happy but to bad I just paid $5000 to get us all this house she can afford $150 given she has $7000 in savings.
Her love day comes she txt me at 8am and said she has no one to help her move. Are u kidding me. So my hubby and I make some calls and one of his mates can help. So me my partner and his friend move her 2 bedroom house in a day.

The following week of her bing at the new house with us is full of snide remarks, speaking to my partner like he doesn’t matter or completely ignoring him, even making comments to my kids. She had a go at my 13 yr old son for slurping his spaghetti at dinner. So my whole family started slurping cos they had his back. Spaghetti is a fun food to eat and they have always sucked the spaghetti up. Whorls they do it outside my dinner table no and if my mother knew them at all she would know that. This in turn gave my son a complex about her picking on only him and she later gave his a complex about his weight by making comments about his eating. He is a 13 yr old boy u don’t do that he isn’t fat if he was I would have addressed this already. But now h thinks he is fat and he doesn’t like his grandmother so he doesn’t feel comfortable in his own home. 

The straw that broke the camels back for me was on a normal day I was at work and get a call from my hubby u know how u asked ur mum to vacuum I said yeah he goes well she broke the vacuum I asked how he doesn’t know but it won’t work. Come to find out babe had dropped it down the stairs. So I get home and I’m cleaning the bathroom and I asked my partner to get mums vacuum to finish off our room cos she refused to do it. Well mum comes into my room yelling with the window open for all the street to hear and says he can’t use her vacuum becuase she doesn’t want it broken like mine even though see broke it. My partner goes off I come out the bathroom like what the hell he says mum said I can’t use the vacuum she goes no I didn’t u just didn’t ask I called her a lier and said I heard u cos u didn’t know I was in the bathroom. It turns into me and her having a fight and said ok if u want to be that way u can be the one to vacuum every second day like we have been doing given u won’t let anyone touch ur vacuum she said no she will do it whenever she feels like it.
I walked away there was no getting through to her. 
The next day I said to her u and I need to have a chat she starts with an attitude I said excuse me u are the one that said we need to communicate and talk stuff out yet u are now acting like a child. She goes oh yeah blame me as always. There was no getting through to her she was yelling a storming away and then goes I will leave then u can do this on ur own I said fine. I told her I don’t like how ur all I will say and do as I like this my time and thinking that has no consequences. I said to her ur not the mother that I knew and I don’t like who u are trying to be become she responds well I don’t like u anyway. I told her that was out of line and she came at me with a hair brush and just missed my face well I lost it and told her ahead of time is a bitter old bïtch (I have never said anything like that to my mother before) and told her if she ever tried to step up to me again I wouldn’t hold back and to get the fuck out of my house and don’t come back. (She has come at me physically before and come at my partner and hit him and I got in the middle of them and get her off him) my daughter and partner had heard all of this and come running down the house. 
Since I told her to leave I have taken her off the lease and she wasn’t invited to my daughter 18th birthday the next month or my sons graduation to high school in December or both my sons birthdays in December or Xmas.
Am I the Ahole here? 
I am riddles with guilt and obligation becuase that’s how she raised me even though I feel I did nothing wrong.

1hq3kyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hq3kyl/stable_extraction_pressure_matters_more_than_15/,Stable extraction pressure matters more than “15 Bar” or “20 Bar” marketing hype ☕,"As someone who has spent years obsessing about espresso machines, I have noticed a frustrating marketing trend. Brands are shouting ""15-bar"", ""20-bar"", or even ""30-bar"" (exaggerated a bit) pressures everywhere as if this was some magical number that guaranteed amazing espresso. When I first started, I also fell for this. It *does sound* impressive. The higher the number, the better it must be... but they aren't.

What's more, those numbers are mostly just marketing fluff. What's really important - and what many manufacturers conveniently gloss-over - is *stability*. What matters is not how much pressure the pump can produce, but how consistently it delivers that pressure during extraction. If the pressure of a machine is inconsistent, it will affect your espresso.

It's not just a nitpick. Stable pressure ensures even extraction, consistent shots and balanced flavors. You'll be left wondering why some shots taste like battery acid and others are god-tier. Most people overlook this detail, but when you do, you will see how it can make a huge difference.

Before we go further, let’s clear this up:

**Pump pressure** refers to the raw output capability of the pump, which is often exaggerated in marketing to grab attention. 🧐

**Extraction pressure** is the amount of force applied to hot water as it passes through the ground coffee bed in an espresso machine, and this is what really matters. ☕ Indeed, it should be a stable 9 or 15 bars to ensure a balanced and flavorful shot. 

⚖️Why **stable extraction pressure** is important

* **Improves Consistency:** Each pull will taste the same as any other. For beginners, stable extraction pressure helps them achieve consistent results, which allows for practice and improvement.
* **Enhances Flavor**: It produces a full-bodied, creamy espresso instead of a thin, harsh or sour result.

If the pressure is not stable?

* **Uneven Extract**: Pressure drops or spikes can cause sour overextraction as well as bitter underextraction from the same puck.
* **Scientific evidence** A study by Cameron Michael I. et al. Unstable pressure can lead to uneven flow of fine grinds. This leads to poor reproducibility and wasted coffee.

I’ll be honest—most of what I’ve shared here is a mix of things I’ve picked up from research papers, YouTube deep dives, and my own trial-and-error experiences. I’ve tried my best to put it all together, but I know there’s always more to learn. 

So, I’d love to hear from you guys:

1. When it comes to picking an espresso machine, what pump features do you think are worth focusing on? Does the type—rotary, vibratory, or gear pumps—actually matter that much? 🤔
2. How important is an OPV (Over Pressure Valve) kit in your experience? Is it a must-have, or just one of those “nice-to-have” features? 🤷♂️ From what I know, most Breville and Gaggia machines include OPV.

If I’ve missed anything or got something wrong, please let me know! I’m always open to learning from others who know more.",0,1735609360.0,espresso,4,0.33,False

So onlyfans has a pretty strict terms of service stipulation against people discussing meeting up. I have a few accounts that I follow that I suspect might have recently switched over to being agency controlled. However, this week I had those three suddenly talk to me about traveling/meeting within a 24 hour period. 

One said she thought I needed a vacation and that she would gladly make arrangements. 

The second said she wanted to come to the US…to meet me…for a cup of coffee. 

The third said she wanted to visit the US. But quickly pivoted to China. 

I’m not delusional. I’m curious about what the endgame is. 

All three are in Eastern Europe. My requests for verification have been met with DARVO type responses. 

I used to do work that made it possible to have friends in various anti HT sections of Law Enforcement. But I want to gather more info before ringing that bell. 

Whoever is on the other end is clearly (and admittedly, according to one) using Chat GPT to communicate/respond. 

This is better than any puzzle anyone could have given me.

","If anyone knows about Kevin's, its legendary. Its a small looking, truck stop- coffee shop with about 8 seats run solo by a nice Korean man named Kevin. I've been going there ever since I moved to Oceanside in '97. Lived around the corner and would walk there almost every morning during the summer for breakfast. 20+ years he's been serving the community in that small coffee shop, and not a thing has changed inside since. I know he may not see this, but to anyone who knows him, we wish him well in his retirement.  

  
Now that formalities are out of the way. I was mortified today at the behavior of a couple people on line this morning. I went shortly after noon, as early as I could get there today if anything just to pay him a visit before he leaves.  He first had run out of bacon, and a couple other things and at one point around 1/130 he said he had run out of food.  (he usually closes @ 2pm btw) I'm sure this is the busiest he's ever been, but the person infront of me AND behind me had the fucking audacity to complain. 

one woman sneered  ""he should have expected to be busy today.."" Bitch as if he owes you anything. The man been here for decades and has the right to run out of product on his last day of work EVER. 

and another woman complained to him that his wife wasnt there today to help. (she sometimes is there on busy saturday's to help out and work the register while he cooks)

  
I honestly couldnt believe the audacity of these people, and the fucking self-entitlement. This man owes you nothing today, nothing. If he wants to close early, he closes early. If he didnt want to be wasteful by ordering surplus product just to throw out what he doesnt sell thats his choice. I should have said something, but I am not one of those people to cause a scene like that, its embarrassing. But not as embarrassing as acting like a petulant child because you couldn't get served food today. Like, if you had to ask me about whats the 1 thing I hate most about Long Island besides the traffic, its the fucking people. 

  
Congrats Kevin. ",109,1735609208.0,longisland,22,0.94,False

The world of smart home appliances is booming, and the coffee maker is no exception.  For coffee lovers seeking a seamless, automated brewing experience, smart coffee makers offer a compelling upgrade. This review dives deep into the Atomi Smart Coffee Maker, comparing its features, performance, and user experience with other leading models to help you decide if it's the right choice for your kitchen.


## Atomi Smart Coffee Maker: A Detailed Look

The Atomi Smart Coffee Maker promises a convenient and high-quality coffee experience.  Its sleek design and compact footprint make it a stylish addition to any countertop. Key features include Wi-Fi connectivity, compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and a built-in grinder for freshly ground beans.  The front-fill water reservoir simplifies refilling, and the deep brew basket ensures even water distribution for consistent brewing.  However, its performance and value proposition must be examined against competitors.


### Atomi Smart Coffee Maker Performance and Coffee Quality

The Atomi's performance hinges on its integrated grinder and brewing capabilities. User feedback suggests generally positive results, with many praising the consistent grind quality leading to a richer, more flavorful cup compared to pre-ground coffee.  The customizable brewing options, including a """"strong"""" setting, allow for personalized preferences.  However, some users have reported inconsistencies in brewing, with occasional uneven extraction.  The grind size adjustment, if available, isn't explicitly detailed in readily available information, potentially impacting the overall brewing consistency and the user's ability to fine-tune the brew to their liking.  Further investigation into the precise grind settings and their impact on brew quality would be beneficial.


### Atomi Smart Coffee Maker: Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* **Smart Home Integration:** Seamless integration with Alexa and Google Assistant allows for voice-activated brewing, scheduling, and control.
* **Built-in Grinder:**  Freshly ground beans contribute significantly to a superior coffee taste.
* **Customizable Brewing:** Options for adjusting brew strength cater to individual preferences.
* **Ease of Use:** The intuitive design and user-friendly app simplify operation.

**Cons:**

* **Price Point:**  The Atomi Smart Coffee Maker sits in the higher price range compared to some competitors, which might be a deterrent for budget-conscious consumers.
* **Limited Scheduling:** While scheduling is possible, the features may be less extensive than those offered by some competing models.  More precise scheduling options, such as specific brew times across multiple days, would enhance user experience.
* **Inconsistency Reports:** Some users have reported occasional uneven brewing, suggesting potential areas for improvement in the brewing process.


## Atomi vs. the Competition: Smart Coffee Maker Showdown

To assess the Atomi's value, let's compare it to other popular smart coffee makers:


### Atomi vs. Keurig K-Supreme Smart Single Serve Coffee Maker

The Keurig K-Supreme Smart stands out with its extensive K-Cup compatibility and MultiStream Technology for optimized brewing.  It offers more precise control over brew strength and temperature, along with advanced scheduling options.  While the Atomi prioritizes fresh-ground coffee, the Keurig offers convenience and a vast selection of coffee varieties.  The choice depends on your preference for freshly ground beans versus the convenience of single-serve pods.


### Atomi vs. Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker

The Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker presents a more budget-friendly alternative with Wi-Fi connectivity and Alexa compatibility.  While lacking the built-in grinder, it offers a simpler, more affordable smart coffee experience.  The trade-off is the use of pre-ground coffee, which may impact the overall quality compared to the Atomi's fresh-ground option.


### Atomi vs. Cafe Grind & Brew Smart Coffee Maker

The Cafe Grind & Brew Smart Coffee Maker rivals the Atomi with its fresh-ground capabilities, but it often includes more advanced features like adjustable grind settings and potentially a milk frothing system.  This positions it as a premium option with a higher price point, offering greater customization and versatility than the Atomi.  A detailed comparison of grind size adjustments and their impact on coffee quality between the Atomi and Cafe models would be particularly useful.


## User Experience and Feedback Analysis

Across various platforms like Amazon and dedicated tech review sites, user feedback on the Atomi Smart Coffee Maker is mixed. While many appreciate the convenience and the quality of freshly brewed coffee, concerns regarding price, occasional brewing inconsistencies, and the limitations of scheduling features are frequently raised.  Analyzing these reviews reveals a need for improved consistency in brewing and potentially more robust scheduling capabilities to fully meet user expectations.


##  Additional Resources and Data

The market for smart home appliances is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing consumer demand for convenience and automation.  While precise statistical data on customer satisfaction rates for specific coffee maker models requires further research, the overall trend points towards a growing preference for smart, connected devices within the home.  Industry experts predict continued innovation in smart coffee maker technology, focusing on enhancing brewing consistency, personalization, and integration with other smart home ecosystems.


## Conclusion: Is the Atomi Smart Coffee Maker Right for You?

The Atomi Smart Coffee Maker offers a compelling blend of convenience, smart home integration, and the superior taste of freshly ground coffee.  However, its higher price point, occasional brewing inconsistencies, and limited scheduling features need to be considered.  If you prioritize freshly ground coffee and smart home integration and are willing to pay a premium, the Atomi is a strong contender.  However, if budget is a primary concern or you require more extensive scheduling features, the Keurig K-Supreme Smart or Hamilton Beach Smart Coffee Maker might be more suitable alternatives.  Ultimately, the best choice depends on your individual needs and priorities.  Further research into specific user reviews and detailed comparisons with competitors will help you make an informed decision.

She seems friendly (I know that's part of the job), and I’d like to get to know her better, but I also don’t want to make her uncomfortable or come across as creepy since she’s working.

I’ve read about a method elsewhere here on reddit, where you leave your number for someone instead of asking for theirs to take the pressure off. This seems like a good approach, but I’m not sure how to execute it naturally in this kind of setting.

Here are my concerns:

1. How do I gauge if she’s open to even a small chat while working?


2. What’s the best way to leave my number without it feeling awkward or out of place?


3. Any general advice on making this feel casual and respectful?



I want to make sure I’m mindful of her boundaries and not put her on the spot. Have any of you successfully approached someone in a similar situation? Or should I just forget about it and look elsewhere?

We talked for a couple of months and then met 3 times.
She was cold most of the times, so I sensed something is off. Everytime I asked she said she is not getting comfortable with me and unsure if we take this forward.
I have been a total gentleman with her, so it's not because of any wrong actions.
She generally takes a lot of time to open up and after the last meet, she said she doesn't want to continue as she is not getting the feeling and would rather save her efforts for someone else.

Although I had my share of past relationships of every kind, it still bugging me what does this mean actually?
I even asked her multiple times to give me some concrete reasons so that i can work on it, the best i got was-""she didn't get comfortable with me after 3 meetings and doesn't see herself getting more comfortable "".

So, I'm 100% bottom who's been engaging in anal sex since I lost my virginity at 24. I haven't been with a huge amount of guys, but lately I've been indulging a bit more in casual sex.

About 3 years ago I had sex with a guy and he immediately got his dick dirty after inserting it. There was mess everywhere. I apologized, since it was probably my fault. I had a bad stomach that day and decided to drink coffee right before meeting him lol. The guy got really upset and stormed off my place.

After that experience I decided to get some toys and put more effort into douching.

Fast forward to this year when I started my slut era. I've had a few hookups and I've shat on all of them leaving every single guy disgusted. Every time it happens I apologize and try to convince them to come back another time. It's making me kinda depressed and desperate in a way.

It seems like douching just doesn't work for me. Even if I insert a dildo (it's an average sized dildo) and it looks clean, when a guy starts hitting hard they get dirty from it. Even if sometimes it's just a little, most of them will be turned off immediately.

Today everything was looking great. I didn't eat all day until 7PM just so I didn't fuck up this time! I douched with a bulb a few times, not too deep, until the water was looking clear. The guy put a dildo in my ass and it was clean... Then when he went inside it happened and it was over.

For context, I know we should clean the rectum which is around 15cm (6in) long and the dick I had today was way above that. Do I really need a full deep douche every time if a guy is hung? I really don't know what to do, is it the way I'm douching?

I feel like I will never be able to experience with my sexuality unless I find a guy who's into scat lol. This situation has been bothering me for at least 3 years, I'm getting desperate.",1,1735608659.0,askgaybros,4,1.0,False

*  Blue Tokai is a chain in the NCR (National Capital Region) and I'd put them a couple ticks above something like Blue Bottle. Their pourovers were competently done and their bean selection is good and somewhat large (6 ish choices). Nothing blew me out of the water but it was very solid. If you're in the NCR, there will probably be one of these near you at most times and they're a reliable option.
* Rosette Coffee Lab is probably the best shop in the city and one of the best shops I've been to period. They do some fun fermentations - including in rum barrels and also with Koji - and also do a great job highlighting Indian coffee estates. Their location isn't very convenient and their hours are inconsistent (check their Instagram before going) but highly recommended. Recommend also going to Prem Di Hatti (stuffed naan) if you go to this part of Delhi.
* Curious Life in Jaipur impressed me quite a bit. Unlike many Indian roasters, they don't focus on Indian origin beans so this is much closer to a normal good roaster that you'd see in the West (I'm not sure what a good comparison would be - they're not in the Onyx tier so whatever you would call right below that). I was impressed they didn't do batch brew or tea, very uncommon for India. Very happy with the Rwandan beans from them I took home.

One general comment I have is that most specialty stores seem to offer pourover in a way that's not true in the US. I always hypothesized that the pourover phenomenon in cities like Tokyo was driven by East Asian's higher rates of lactose intolerance. That doesn't hold in India - and the milk is very high quality there too - but we still see a huge pourover presence.  I don't know what explains this.",3,1735608467.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1hq39qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1hq39qa/been_living_in_poland_for_months_now_been_meeting/,"Been Living in Poland for months now.  Been meeting up with Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusian girls  for years.  Can someone tell me the truth?  Where do you meet these good girls from these countries?","So let me tell you my story.  I'm a guy with multiple hobbies like muay Thai, Judo, swimming, salsa and I have a decent job that makes an above average salary in a state like Illinois, but I get that salary in Poland since I work remotely.  I occasionally mess around with yoga studios and I go clubbing from time to time even though I don't like it. I don't smoke, drink and I recently quit coffee.  I get a lot of attention from girls in the USA as well and had no issues getting dates, however, the girls there are less attractive and they compete with men.

Now I have been looking for a serious girlfriend for a while.  I followed every single single recommendation on this sub to see where these good Ukrainian girls are.  Do you know the result?  I just ended up with empty sex most of the time just to realize I'll never see these girls again. *This is what I experienced from August 1st to December 18:*

**Ukrainian girl #1:**  We met at the yoga studio.  Girl wanted to try bachata with me since she always wanted to give it a try.  We had fun and went on multiple dates and we eventually went to bed.  Sex was very good and we had sex multiple times, but in bed one day, she said she's not really interested in a relationship at this point in her life. She said she just wants to have fun. She is 23.  Later I checked her social media and found out she has an OF.  She would message me from time to time as well, but as a way to get emotional support.

**Ukrainian girl #2:**  We met online. We meet up for a pizza at an Italian restaurant. We had an interesting conversation.  After the restaurant, she gives me gum and she also chews gum with me. Later on she kisses me.  We kissed for 4 hours.  The next day, she messages me and said she had mixed feelings.  She flaked out on me for 4 days.  On the 5th day, she messages me unexpectedly and we hang out again.  I rent out a place and we have fun there and for some reason she wants to spend the night with me.  I wake up at 5AM and catch her looking through my shit.  What the fuck?  I didn't have money on me and I only had one credit card with me which was in my pants.  I played it off like I didn't see anything.  Next day, she just vanished on me and never messaged me back again.  She is 21 years old.

**Ukrainian girl #3:** Some fool on this reddit recommended me to meet girls at the club.  I thought I'd chill out and have fun.  I thought that maybe I was overreacting.  I'd dance around a bit and I just took one shot of vodka which I haven't done in years. I'd casually speak with some Polish girls about life and eventually I met a Ukrainian girl there. She found out I have an American passport and that I can speak Russian. We hit it off and we went back to my rented place.  I don't have sex with her, but she did something intimate for me and I fall asleep like a baby since I had a good time and didn't expect evil. This time I actually did get my shit stolen.  I had 600 zloty stolen from me and she vanished in the morning. Completely unexpected since the girl before this one also looked through my shit.  This girl said she was 26 years old but at this point not sure what to believe.

**Ukrainian girl #4:**  At this point, I'm kind of irritated and cautious.  I go on this sub and lash out at some passport bros for thinking Ukrainian girls are good.  Some guy says I need to go for older girls and so I gave that a shot. There was an incredibly hot 28 year old Ukrainian girl at the salsa studio.  I asked her out for dinner.  She agreed.  First date went fine at the Italian restaurant. Second date came up. She was very intelligent and had lots of sexual energy and she teased me from under the table.  Went back to my place and had the most insane sexual experience of my life.  She used to be a ballerina and could move all the limbs in her body independently.  I thought I already experienced it all in bed but that was something else.  Disregarding that new sexual experience I had, we also talked a lot about relationships.  She said she needed a man to protect her and gift her.  So eventually in 2 weeks, I bought her gifts at Westfield Arkadia. Another week passes and she asks for the newest Iphone.  I told her that I need to wait until the next paycheck.  She was okay with that and as time passes, I see her with that new Iphone she wanted at the salsa studio.  I do some deep searching and find out she's also fucking around with another guy at the same exact time.  How did I find out? I looked at her instagram followers and saw a guy that posted a story with her in the image.  It's some Polish guy with a business. I confront her about it eventually and she completely lied about everything lol.  She said she got the new phone using her own money and told me I could gift her something else and she said that all while pretending it's a joke.

**Ukrainian girl #5:**  Now I'm pissed off at all of you on this sub for trying to convince me that I'm thinking wrongly of Ukrainian girls.  Kind of depressed since it's December and very cold. No sun in Poland. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm unlucky and I just came across bad girls.  I thought of a place where I could meet a smart girl.  Someone loyal. I go to the coffee shop and bring my laptop with me.  Over there I see a very cute girl and just start a conversation with a girl about the book she was reading(it was in Russian).  We discuss the book and eventually she ends up speaking in perfect English.  We have a long conversation and exchange contacts. After 2 days, we go on a walk and we discuss relationships.  She said she expects expensive gifts from guys from time to time. In short, her logic was that she doesn't believe in feminism but expects all the benefits of feminism + expensive gifts and chivalry from guys.  By that time, I friend zone her and realize I was right all along and that all of you guys that praise Ukrainian girls don't know what you are talking about.    To continue this story, I just kept being her friend.  I tried to be a good friend and never flirted or hinted at anything sexual.  She eventually seduced me at my apartment while we were cooking something and intimate things happened.  The next day, she hints that ""we are in a relationship now"" on telegram. I said that I'm not so sure. Another two days pass and she wants to go to the mall for her to buy shit.  AGAIN, I FELL INTO THE TRAP.  I said that we are not into a relationship and that sex can't buy things.  She goes absolutely apeshit and said I used her.  She was the one who initiated everything in the kitchen.  She's 25 years old.

Now I'm writing this post on December 31th. I'm absolutely traumatized by the future implications of this kind of lifestyle. Are you guys that recommend Ukraine joking or  or do you have some kind of Eastern Europe girl fantasy believing they are angels? Do you guys even go outside to even provide this advice that you spit out on Ukraine and Russia? I technically fucked 5 escorts within 3 months and now I'm sitting here alone with no contact to any of these girls anymore. They are doing their own shit hustling while I have no girlfriend.  I just have memories of me getting laid and I could use that to my wanking advantage but what the hell is the point of even having those memories when it's just similar to using porn. If I continue living like this for 5 more years, I will be broke and end up with nothing.  I've even dated other Ukrainian girls long term before experiencing this new adventurous bullshit you guys recommended and the result was the same but just long term mindfuckery.

I guess it's Asia for me then.  : /",20,1735608425.0,thepassportbros,23,0.92,False

First, how do you personally budget while homeless? What should I prioritize? Obviously daily $5 coffees are out. 

40F. No car (no license, I have seizures). No family, or friends due to mental health issues but i have never had a substance abuse problem and I'm hoping that fact helps me out in the coming months.  

I have $1000 left in savings, and $750/mo income. I have $500 to put toward gear and I have one month to prepare. 

I need to stay in Chicago for my gig job and medical care.

I'm planning to get a mailbox with UPS and finding a 24hour gym. Is there anything else I should look into? Safe deposit box for my super critical paperwork?

What do I need to AVOID, gear wise for being homeless in the city of Chicago?

What gear do I 100% need? Do I need a sleeping bag/tent hybrid? How does someone who snores/has sleep apnea sleep safely while homeless?

I am already a minimalist and have nothing to sell except a futon I paid $500 for. I do have an air fryer, old toaster, a microwave, and an immersion blender but i doubt I'd get $100 for the whole lot. I'd like to keep them if possible, though, for if I luck out and find a room for rent,so I wont have to rebuy but I also understand how that 'cling-to' mindset is unhelpful.  

I have already downgraded my phone plan to Visible mobile. I didn't have any subscriptions. I do have credit card debt but only $2k and if people here think it's advisable, I can see about paying that off sooner than later. 

I have a pre-paid storage unit through May 2025 so I can store my medical gear and the few clothes/toiletries I have. I feel like due to my medical needs a storage unit will be a worthwhile expense. Any advice on that?  

I planned to get Airbnb for Feb and March to get through winter with hope I'll be able to find a room for rent by April. I do have a job but it only pays $750/mo and IDK if the Airbnb route is fiscally wasteful. I just don't know what else to do for Feb and March.

We are in our late 20s/early 30s and were huge fans from the very beginning. We lived next door to each other growing up and both had brothers so we were like the sisters we never had. I remember coming home from school and going over to each other’s houses to watch the video diaries or wait for their new music videos. 

When the Up All Night tour was first announced, we tried desperately to get tickets but it was basically impossible. Her dad surprised us with tickets for her birthday that year and it was one of the best concert experiences ever. We went to the Take Me Home tour together next and it was even better! As we got older, we grew less dedicated (me especially unfortunately) but still had a deep love for the boys and followed their solo careers after the hiatus. She was the first one I texted when I heard the news about Liam. 

We have both moved away from our home town but came back for the holidays. Last week we went Boxing Day shopping, and I was playing Four as we drove. We both sang our hearts out and it was like being transported back to those carefree days when all we were worried about was getting tickets/merch and watching the latest episode of Adventurous Adventures lol. 

She’s driving home today and I fly home this Friday, so we decided to hop in the car and do it all over again before we leave. We grabbed a coffee and a sweet treat and drove aimlessly for three hours, singing our way through all five albums and reminiscing. It was worth every drop of gas. It’s so bittersweet knowing Liam won’t be joining us in 2025, but I’m so grateful to have rediscovered their music and this connection to my cousin. It’s one of my favourite memories of 2024 (I know I’m cutting it close!). 

I love her so much. I love the boys so much and I love this fandom for how we’ve come together during such a difficult time. Hope everyone is taking care of themselves. Happy New Year to the Directioner Family ❤️💚💙💛🇨🇮",1,1735606930.0,OneDirection,0,1.0,False

1hq2qbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/InkForge/comments/1hq2qbu/kindness_a_christmas_gift/,Kindness - A Christmas Gift,"It was Christmas morning. The lights on the tree danced merrily. Presents exploded from under the tree. The train sung its Christmas carols as it circled its track. The sun had just risen, and there were murmurs of wakefulness from the bedrooms.

“MUUUUUUUUMMMM!” There was a scream from the hallway. “SANTA CAAAAAAAME!”

An answering laugh came from the main bedroom and the door opened. 

“Yeah, we’re up. Put the kettle on and we can start opening presents.” The mother smiled down at the children.

The door closed again and the parents lingered in the room, sharing an early morning kiss and a few light caresses. But it wasn’t long until the children were banging on the door again, demanding their presence in the lounge room.

Hot mugs were clutched in adult hands. Childish squeals filled the room. Paper ripped and ribbons were thrown in the air. It was a mess by the time the children had torn their way through the pile under the tree.

And then the lounge room was silent, the children disappearing outside to start playing with the toys they had been gifted. In the quiet, the adults were nestled together, empty mugs on the coffee table, arms draped over each other.

“I’d say that was a success.” The father laughed.

The mother rolled her eyes, letting out a deep sigh. “I just want to go back to sleep.”

“You always do.”

A kiss was pressed to her forehead and her face crinkled up in a smile. It made his heart feel incredibly full as he looked down at her. There was a bang outside, and then a squeal of laughter that relaxed the sudden tension.

“Bloody kids.” He muttered.

“Who’d have ‘em.” She responded.

“You, you menace.” He laughed.

She grinned. “Yeah, but you enjoy putting them in me. You could say no.”

“Where’s the fun in that?”

There was a rush of movement as she sat up, her leg pressed against his. “I have a gift for you.”

“I thought we weren’t doing gifts this year.” He complained. “I don’t have anything for you. You can’t just spring this on me last minute.”

Her head tilted, a finger on her chin as she pretended to think about it. “Yes I can!”

With that, she bounded away, practically skipping to their bedroom. He sighed, rubbing his face. This woman was going to be the death of him. But there was no one he would rather stress him out than her.

“Here!”

A small thin present was pressed into his hand. He looked at it, then to her as she dropped back onto the lounge beside him. Carefully, he unwrapped it. And his fears and hopes were both realised.

Two thin pink lines showed in the little window. Her lips pressed against his cheek.

“Merry Christmas.” She whispered.

He caught her in his arms, pressing a hard kiss to her lips. “Merry Christmas.”

1hq2qbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/JAKnight/comments/1hq2qbl/a_christmas_gift_kindness/,A Christmas Gift - Kindness,"It was Christmas morning. The lights on the tree danced merrily. Presents exploded from under the tree. The train sung its Christmas carols as it circled its track. The sun had just risen, and there were murmurs of wakefulness from the bedrooms.

“MUUUUUUUUMMMM!” There was a scream from the hallway. “SANTA CAAAAAAAME!”

An answering laugh came from the main bedroom and the door opened. 

“Yeah, we’re up. Put the kettle on and we can start opening presents.” The mother smiled down at the children.

The door closed again and the parents lingered in the room, sharing an early morning kiss and a few light caresses. But it wasn’t long until the children were banging on the door again, demanding their presence in the lounge room.

Hot mugs were clutched in adult hands. Childish squeals filled the room. Paper ripped and ribbons were thrown in the air. It was a mess by the time the children had torn their way through the pile under the tree.

And then the lounge room was silent, the children disappearing outside to start playing with the toys they had been gifted. In the quiet, the adults were nestled together, empty mugs on the coffee table, arms draped over each other.

“I’d say that was a success.” The father laughed.

The mother rolled her eyes, letting out a deep sigh. “I just want to go back to sleep.”

“You always do.”

A kiss was pressed to her forehead and her face crinkled up in a smile. It made his heart feel incredibly full as he looked down at her. There was a bang outside, and then a squeal of laughter that relaxed the sudden tension.

“Bloody kids.” He muttered.

“Who’d have ‘em.” She responded.

“You, you menace.” He laughed.

She grinned. “Yeah, but you enjoy putting them in me. You could say no.”

“Where’s the fun in that?”

There was a rush of movement as she sat up, her leg pressed against his. “I have a gift for you.”

“I thought we weren’t doing gifts this year.” He complained. “I don’t have anything for you. You can’t just spring this on me last minute.”

Her head tilted, a finger on her chin as she pretended to think about it. “Yes I can!”

With that, she bounded away, practically skipping to their bedroom. He sighed, rubbing his face. This woman was going to be the death of him. But there was no one he would rather stress him out than her.

“Here!”

A small thin present was pressed into his hand. He looked at it, then to her as she dropped back onto the lounge beside him. Carefully, he unwrapped it. And his fears and hopes were both realised.

Two thin pink lines showed in the little window. Her lips pressed against his cheek.

“Merry Christmas.” She whispered.

He caught her in his arms, pressing a hard kiss to her lips. “Merry Christmas.”",1,1735606841.0,JAKnight,0,1.0,False

“It’s-”

“No it’s not. It’s Cullen.” Ron Bigsby sipped fruit juice from his coffee mug, loudly and somehow pointedly.

The office was cramped, but not because it was small. In fact, it was fairly large. It had to be, to accommodate the many, many lights, buzzers, switches, buttons, and monitors that loomed over him and whoever was on the other side of his desk at all times. It was like the cold, unfeeling eye of the government was in the room with you, waiting for mistakes. But it wasn’t you they were watching, it was all the things that weren’t inside their walls.

“Why?” Cullen asked. “Doesn’t that mean dog or something?”

“Dunno. But it’s your name now, kid.” Ron was almost sixty years old. His skin was dark and weathered, and his eyes were invariably examining, like he didn’t need to know you to know you: he just needed a quick glance, and everything in your head was bared for his interpretation. He was of an older generation, and Cullen was told he’d had firsthand experience from the start of the Change.

“Why?” Cullen repeated.

“Names are personal around here. Nicknames only. If you have to give one, just your first. Let me make this clear right now, since you never know who’s listening: first names to guide the lost. Nicknames to be addressed. Full, if you want someone else to own it. Understood?” He sounded like he ate nails, his voice was so scarred, or smoked the whole pack when he got cigarettes.

“Yeah, got it. But why do I get to know yours?”

“I have to play god. You got to call god’s real name to talk to him, don’t you?”

Cullen just stared at him. And Ron just moved on.

“So. You want to be a border boy. Why? Honest answers only. Nobody likes liars around here.”

“Is this really-”

“Yes.”

Cullen sighed. “Okay. My… Friends. Friendly friends. Fits. I want to make sure everyone gets through alright.”

“And?” Ron Bigsby waited. Waited just long enough, sipping fruit juice out of his coffee mug like it was his god given mission to defy its intended use, that Cullen grudged out an answer.

“My dad.”

“Files say you were raised by a stranger.”

“Don’t call him that.” Cullen had to keep himself from clenching his fists.

“Okay. Continue.”

Cullen paused. He debated getting up and leaving, but he looked out the window. Ron had a full bird’s eye view of the Outside, and Society. To Cullen’s left, endless dark trees, with hints of other things on the horizon. Mountains that didn’t quite make sense with where they were placed on the board. Patchworks of landscape that obviously didn’t belong where they were, but blatantly defied logic. Somewhere, over all that, an unknown nobody had ever seen. No matter where you were in the Outside, three directions led to Society. One led to a place nobody ever went, and the people who tried to make the number less negligible never came back, or they wouldn’t tell you what they saw. Couldn’t.

At least, never in a way that made the picture full: you were only allowed glimpses.

If Cullen looked right, there it was. A familiar landscape, with a familiar series of roads, leading to a familiar city where everyone was normal, no matter where they came from. Nothing out of order, nothing out of place.

He cleared his throat, turned back to Ron’s patient gaze. “I’ve heard a lot of people tell me my dad wasn’t real because of where he came from. That some of my friends, my neighbors, coworkers… Weren’t real. That they were just pretending.”

“And how does that make you feel?”

“...This isn’t therapy.” His correction got no reaction, so he just kept on. “I don’t like it. I don’t like that, if some of them just disappeared, nobody would bat an eye or ask where they went.”

“And your father…”

“I know what you’re going to say. Yes. Part of me hopes maybe I’ll just see him walk up to the checkpoint one day. But… It’s both.”

“Does any part of you want to know what’s at the far end of the road? Before you say you don’t know what I mean, no, you do. And it’s important.”

Cullen didn’t answer right away. But he did, and he did it honestly. “I do. But I don’t want to know where I’ll go, if I don’t come back.”

Ron Bigsby studied him. Cullen felt like he was thinking about something more than just professional interview etiquette and job safety. Cullen watched him turn his thoughtful blue eyes towards the Outside. He leaned back in his big black arm chair, all dark leather and comfort. Cullen wondered if he got the good chair because he was important here, or if he’d just brought it up here and nobody cared enough to question it.

“I gotta ask some really specific questions. They might be off-putting, but again, honest answers.”

“Okay.”

“Are you comfortable with repeating phrases, with little variation? Are you comfortable with being called in to replace other staff in an emergency? Are you comfortable with strange gifts? Are you comfortable with interacting through barriers? Are you comfortable with staring something in the eye at the risk of varying side effects?”

Cullen answered yes to every question, with increasing discomfort. He fidgeted a bit in his chair. His was old wood, beaten and weathered, with strange phrases carved into it.

“Quick answers, kid. You sure?”

“I know they have to do weird things at the border already. Half of it’s the same stuff we do back home every day, isn’t it? Just-”

“With more consequences.” Ron looked towards him again, turned to face him. He put down his mug, and he clasped his hands together. He smiled. Stared Cullen right in the eye. “Tell me, what makes you think I’m human?”

“I’m sorry?”

“I’m looking you in the eye. You can see all my little appendages.” He wriggled his hands. Opened his mouth, briefly, stuck out his tongue in an almost child-like gesture. It was almost insulting. “But if you looked past the desk and saw I didn’t have feet, how would you feel?”

“Uh… Like you need to go to the hospital.”

Ron paused. His eyes flashed with a bit of good humor, but it dropped just as quick. “Okay, take away one of my eyes. Hell, both of them. Pull out my teeth, my tongue, or maybe I don’t have a mouth. Maybe I’ve got no hands.”

“Where is this going?”

“Would you feel uncomfortable? Maybe afraid?”

“Depends on-”

“Now what if I had all these things, but I was lying to you? Maybe there’s eyes on the back of my head, and I’m actually blind right now.” Ron stood up, did a little twist. He had gray hair, and if there was some secret third eye, Cullen wasn’t seeing it.

“Oh.”

“Oh is right, kid.” Ron sat down. There was a bit of weight to it, like he was suddenly tired. “Now here’s another, and a lot of this is off-script, but bear with me: what if I got into an awful accident. I don’t know, maybe I got run over by a milk truck, and some of that stuff was gone. Am I someone else, or am I Ron?”

Cullen thought about it. It seemed like a trick question. Yes was obvious, no was also obvious. No, because he was supposed to watch for discrepancies at this job. “I don’t know.”

“Exactly.” Ron smiled again, but he looked like he was almost uncomfortable doing it. “People and strangers are basically the same thing, unless they’re not. Some of us keep our skin the same on both sides of the wall. Others try to fit in.” And he leaned close again, looked at Cullen like he was trying to figure out if he, sitting right here in the sectional communications officer’s own den, was a trickster himself. “Do you know why I’m rambling right now, about this?”

“Because it’s important to the job.”

“Because it’s important to the job, and keeping the job from becoming too professional.” He leaned back, finished off his fruit juice, dropped every bit of humor from his voice. It contrasted sharply with his relaxed posture. “Here’s what this job actually is. They don’t want me to bring you in this way, since it turns away candidates, but they also know damn well it’s the truth, so they never stop me. You’re not here to turn people away or let them in. You’re here to bear the burden of feeling out which side of the wall they belong on.”

There was a period of quiet. Maybe it was to let the old man’s words sink in, maybe Ron just wanted him to process. “Can I ask something?” Cullen’s voice was lower, a bit tentative.

“Always.”

“You’re talking about our job - your job - like it doesn’t matter. So… What’s the point, then?”

“Formality.” There was another silence, one where Cullen waited for Ron to follow up with some more long-winded explanation. He got one, in a way. Ron adjusted his position, rested his head on his hand as he looked out at Society. “If I picked up my mug and tried to break your nose, what would happen?”

“What?” Cullen pursed his lips. “I’d hit back.”

“And?”

“One of us, or both of us, would go to jail.”

“The point is to keep that making sense. If I walked all the way to the ends of the earth, out into that great unknown, maybe I’d come back with all the answers. Maybe I’d find none. Maybe, there’d be someone sitting at a desk over there, with a bunch of lights-” Ron gestured to the alert boards. “-With someone in a box telling them what to do about me.” He pulled out a cigarette, lit it right in front of Cullen.

Cullen didn’t bother pointing out the lack of professionalism. It didn’t seem like it mattered.

The old man continued. “I’m going to tell them to hire you now. I’m going to hand you some pamphlets, when you come back. You seem like a reasonable kid, who will listen when I tell you to do something, and maybe you’ll listen to the other people who I rotate with. But-”

“But?”

“-I need you to remember that we don’t know much. I can’t tell you where they came from, or why they came now. But I can tell you a few things: the more like us they seem, the less they have to learn, the more you should walk on eggshells. There will always be rules, and they will invariably be mostly bullshit. But they’ll be rules, so they’ll need to be followed.” He pulled an ashtray out of his desk, like putting out the cigarette was his equivalent to pulling out the bottle, not pulling out the bottle itself. “Nobody likes rule breakers. Not even them.”

Cullen wanted to ask if he meant them or the strangers, but it clicked: it didn’t matter.

Cullen was asked another series of questions. He was asked if he was comfortable working with strangers. He said yes. He was asked if he could be trusted to follow instructions, and he said yes. He was asked if he had any useful skills, and he gave them. He was asked if he had any mementos he wanted to bring in, and only hesitated when asked if he’d give them up if necessary. Finally, he was asked if he understood he was putting his life at risk, of his own volition, and if he understood that he would be severely punished if he intentionally neglected his duties and put others at risk.

He said yes.  
\---

When Ron returned from his authorized vacation days, Cullen did not ask to be let into Ron’s office. He did not ask for permission to put the note from the tube on his desk, sit down, and ask him what the hell it meant.

“It means we’re getting an inspection.” Ron answered, smoothly despite his half-burnt tone.

“From who?” Cullen asked. His voice was not smooth. It was not calm, in either sense.

“I don’t know. But be on your best behavior.”

“Excuse me?” Cullen’s muscles tensed as he felt himself quickly losing his cool. He took a deep breath, looked Ron in the eye as he was about to say something, then tossed the photo onto his desk. Ron Bigsby stared at it. He blinked, briefly off-balanced, before fully focusing his attention on Cullen. Facing him in full now.

“Do you remember when I said I don’t know what’s on the other side?” Ron didn’t wait to follow up. He started to pull out a cigarette, paused, and put the pack back. The gesture was enough to get Cullen to hold off for a moment. “I think I used to. I’m pretty sure I used to remember what the actual name of the place we walled up was, too. I’m pretty sure I could place a name on every town out in that hellscape-” And he flicked his eyes to the Outside. “But I can’t now.”

“And why not? What is making you - making everyone - forget, Ron?”

“I don’t know. But what I know is that, the ones who are meant to come inside act like they belong, and the ones that aren’t… They take things. Sometimes, they take each other. Sometimes, its places. The things we really want to keep, we stop naming. There’s special ones. Ones that like to keep things… Proper, who come around sometimes. More proper than normal.”

“Why doesn’t anyone else know about the extra rules? Why’d I learn half this shit going out to the walls?”

“You know how people leave their coat, and their shoes, at the entrance? You don’t have to wear your shoes past the door. If someone tracks mud in anyways, nobody wants them in the house.”

“Come on, Ron. Cut the dance-around shit.”

“You don’t need them inside. You just need them outside. And nobody wants there to be nowhere to go, so my guess is there’s someone who wants to do our job, their way.”

“What do I do, Ron? Advise me. It’s your job.”

Cullen expected Ron to look angry. Instead, he just looked… Hollow. He slumped into his big fancy chair. Now he took out the cigarette, now he lit it. “You follow the rules, so that they keep making sense to everyone inside. I’ll do the best I can to help, and Tommy will too, and so will Lupe.” There was a pause. A tension. Ron leaned forward, looked Cullen in the eye like he always did when he really wanted to communicate something’s importance. “Cullen.”

Cullen didn’t say a word, looked slightly aside. Out the window, towards Outside. Ron spoke anyway.

“The ones who we let in. The ones we were supposed to let in. There’s no… Conspiracy. If you’re meant to be inside, you’re meant to be inside. That’s all there is to it. Don’t look at ‘where from’, but ‘who is’.” Ron closed his eyes briefly. Cullen almost let that be all there was to it. The conversation was over and all that was left to do was quietly return to work. But there was one last thing.

“Why did you take this job, Ron?”

Ron blinked, caught off guard. He laughed, shook his head. “I’m waiting for someone to come back, too.” His voice didn’t have any humor in it, just… Other things. The humor faded from his face with the next sentence. “I want there to be something for them to come back to. That’s all.”

Cullen left his office. He was not stopped by security, and it dawned on him that maybe Ron had known he’d be storming up to his office and just did not care. Or, he’d already known what was going to happen, with the ‘inspector’ and their ‘notice’ or warning or whatever it had been. Either someone called him before he got back, or…

It didn’t matter, either way. For all he knew they just didn’t have leftover staff for it. And it wasn’t Ron’s job to let people in, it was his.

When he returned to the checkpoint booth area, he sat down. Flexed his fingers, picked up his mug. He didn’t drink from it, it was empty right now. He stared at it, instead. Even after all these years, it still made sense to him that he hadn’t been left behind on purpose. And it still made sense to do his job. What didn’t make sense anymore was all the little lines in the sand, which ones were real and which ones weren’t.

He looked over at Lupe. Let himself actually look at her, for the first time in days. He knew what she was, everyone did. They showed each other on the first day, to diffuse the tension of knowing but not seeing it. Her hair was short clipped, her face was completely in line with the exact image you’d have in your head if you only thought of a stranger as someone you didn’t quite get a good look at going down the street: plain, pleasant if you cared, nothing important if you didn’t.

But he didn’t think she was hiding what she hid because she was trying to lie to anyone. If she were trying to hide anything, she wouldn’t be shaking right now. Cullen followed her eyes towards the second window of the security checkpoint, watched her skim over every single monitor and alert system. He became uneasy because she was uneasy, his shoulders tensed because hers did.

He was afraid because he knew what she was, but she was never fully at ease when she went Outside. And he’d never seen her watch the window like that before.

Cullen pulled out the photo. He’d taken it back off Ron’s desk on the way out. He needed it in front of him so he knew it was real.

It was customary to have photos taken, when you did anything with strangers. It made the ones you wanted around feel normal, and it proved to the people you thought were normal that they showed up on camera still. It was also said that, sometimes, unfits would not show up, or you could catch them in the hidden corners of photos, and you’d know they were nearby. It was even said, if something was off about someone in a photo, it was because they were not meant to be there.

Ron was supposed to be there. So was Tommy, and Lupe, in all her strangeness, her real self. The Moss Man was meant to be there, too, having been caught in the background not long before he showed up properly and earned passage through the gates. There’d been a few others: some security officers, the ones that made double triple sure the people coming in were supposed to and that they hadn’t learned human tactics, like concealed firearms. Some of the comm aids, the other shifts… It was supposed to have at least two dozen people in it.

Only Cullen was there. And, if he looked, he could see people who he had never met, who did not look quite right, in the shadows between the trees. Cullen was slightly distorted in the photo, and he had no idea if that was an omen or not. This was a copy, the original was still in a scrapbook type folder somewhere, so could’ve just been a shitty print that got edited. But what he knew, for certain fact, was that he did not like that he was alone in it.

He liked it even less when he compared it to the apartment complex photo, and noticed most of the other people who lived with him were still in it, except one specific individual. He’d seen him disappear on the monitor, into that closet, but he’d only seen his hand then. Cullen wondered if he was alone, wherever he was, and also wondered if that was good or bad. Part of him, selfishly, hoped he never found out. If he found out, he might also discover, for certain, that he was the reason he was gone.

He looked at Lupe again. He wanted to ask what she was afraid of. Almost opened his mouth and said the words. Then he decided he did not want to know. Instead, he wanted to make sure none of them found out.",2,1735606794.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Even in elementary school when she’d ask me how school was and I said we got new seating arrangements, I learned to lie and say that my table only had girls so she wouldn’t get mad and freak out if a boy was sitting next to me. Now in college, my dad keeps reminding me to call her all the time, whenever she picks up (she has called me during exams or when im studying and lectures me when I don’t pick up, which makes me want to not pick up even more.) she asks me why I don’t talk to her about my life and acts so hurt and betrayed that I don’t tell her anything. If I tell her I tried caffeine pills because I don’t like how coffee makes me feel, she gets mad and says anything I take has to go through her (I have no health issues.) if I tell her my friends mom is trying to set up my friend with a boy from church she gets mad and tells me not to talk to that girl anymore. Not to mention when I call her or even speak to her, she will just talk and talk for literally more than 30 minutes without letting me speak. My friends know im pretty calm and collected but around her I get snappy and upset so easily and I hate who I am. I felt so much better in college bc for the first time I felt free to be myself. So yeah, I dread calling my mom. I only do it because im financially dependent and my dad tells me to. I can’t wait to finally have a big girl job, support myself, and stop calling her for good.

1hq2pd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1hq2pd1/ongoing_grief_over_the_loss_of_a_cat_soul_mate/,Ongoing grief over the loss of a cat soul mate,"Hey r/Petloss community. This is a really long read and I understand if you don't read it or comment on it, but I wanted to put it out there, chronicle my cat's story because she meant the world to me and I'm trying to heal in any way possible. Maybe it will help me, maybe it will help you if you're going through something similar, I hope it helps *someone*. Love to all of those who have lost their best buddies.

It's been almost 2 months since my beautiful bright best friend and soul cat, Rizzo, passed away, and my heart hurts intensely every single day. I have been suffering so hard, crying at least once a day, starting from when she was diagnosed with mammary cancer, at the end of September, to now. I wanted to tell the story to hopefully relieve some of the pressure constantly pushing down on my chest, the headaches that I've gotten from crying fits, just sharing with the community of folks who know what it's like to have their best friend taken too soon. She was the love of my life, I told her all of the time, and there will never be another one like her.

In May of 2024 I noticed a black lump around one of her nipples. She always did this cute stretch entering a room, into a full plop down lay on the floor, sometimes showing me her belly, that had the most wonderful soft, wavy fur. She had been doing this more often, like she was asking me to take a closer look, something wasn't right. So, not even considering what it might mean (I wasn't thinking about cancer and I'm not sure why), my husband and I took her to the vet to get it checked.

While at this first vet visit, the veterinarian that we saw seemed to rush through our visit, looking at the lump, then proceeding to lance it. Some puss and a bit of blood came out, and they said that there was ""no way this is cancer"" stating it was just cystic. So, my husband and I were relieved, and went about life as normal with our three lovely cats, now believing that nothing was wrong.

Some time goes by and Rizzo seems like her normal, chirpy, sweet self. We noticed that the cyst had returned, in force, and was now larger, with a growing mass below the skin. We took her to the vet again, and met with a different vet (not requested, just coincidental). This vet took a look at our girl and said that we should get the mass biopsied, it could be cancer. I can't say that at that moment in time it registered that this could be true. She didn't meet any markers to have cancer, as a 5 year old cat, spayed before 6 months, indoor, healthy as can be, it didn't seem right. So I had high hopes that it would be ok, after all that first vet said that there's not way a cat her age could have cancer.

Well, we had the cyst removed, it was sent out for a biopsy, and took her home later that day. She was so dopey and had to wear one of those terrible plastic Elizabethan collars, the sight of the removal looking like it was straight out of a horror movie. Luckily, I was on a short break from work and was able to stay home and be her nurse for her recovery.

Sadly, the day before I returned to work, my husband got the call with the results of the biopsy. He was at work and felt like he had to keep it to himself all day just so he could make it home to tell me in person and be by my side. The moment he said ""Rizzo has cancer"", was the moment I started to cry and I haven't stopped ever since then.

We had a decision to make going forward about treatment vs. no treatment and it was one of 2 of the hardest decisions we've ever had to make, the second being the day we had to let her go. After discussing the options with our vet, as well as a couple of other animal experts, and doing some research on our own time, we decided not to put her through a double chain mastectomy + chemo. This was SO hard to come to terms with, but ultimately we were told by an animal professional ""if you take her to those procedures she will no longer be your cat. And don't even get me started on chemo! Enjoy your cat while she is here with you."" And you know, this person was right.

I took Rizzo back to the vet to get her stitches removed, and ready with about 700 questions for our new vet, who was very kind and caring, they really helped us through our decision making and care for our girl. Unfortunately there was not too much that we could do, though I vowed to try anything that could help extend her life, keep the cancer at bay, or ease her pain.

I purchased a couple of books about natural/homeopathic care for animals. I got her mushroom supplements, started making food for her through pet friendly recipes found in the books I had, got omega 3 supplements to put on her food, and a Chinese herbal supplement that I had ordered through a local chiropractor (the supplier only sells to licensed practitioners). She went along with my crazy antics at first but quickly started saying no to all avenues I tried, and I started to feel hopeless.

She declined so quickly, sleeping almost all of the time, eating less and less, her back leg starting to swell, and then her other legs towards the end. She became so skinny and for the most part immobile, the last few days of her life making it nearly impossible for her to get out of her bed and use the litter box that was not far away. Her tumor started to smell horrible, a smell that would stay stuck in my nostrils even when I left the house. But I didn't care. I would live with that smell as long as she wanted to be here with us.

I became her nurse, once more, cleaning her wound 2-3 times a day with a solution from the vet, feeding her, bringing the bowl right up to her mouth when she wouldn't stand up to eat anymore, and then when she wouldn't eat her wet food, moved onto the Churu treats, which remained her only sustenance for the last 1 1/2 weeks of her life. Even then, she was eating so sloppily and would eventually turn her head as far away from the food as possible, breaking my heart more and more each time. She would end up with food all over her neck, and my husband and I would take turns brushing her out gently. It was so sh\*\*, she was always such a clean cat, smelling like maple syrup, it felt so undignified when she was unable to clean herself, I felt so bad for her.

About a month out from her diagnosis, we had an appointment with the vet and I knew this would be her last day. Of course the darnedest thing happened a few days prior, which was that she got up and started scratching her scratching post, she hadn't touched it in weeks, and then proceeded to pull her body up on this old homemade cat tree we have (at the top of the stairs!), my husband and I were so surprised, and she looked so proud, to be in one of her spots again, how crushing that we had to bring her down from the top, afraid that she would fall and hurt herself more or even die from a fall. And crushingly, a day before we took her in, she was ""walking"" into different rooms, trying to appear normal. Mind you, every few steps she needed to stop and lay down, with labored breathing, likely the cancer had started to spread to her lungs, as it eventually does with mammary cancer.

The entire day before our appointment, I stayed with her, and talked to her, and cried a nonstop river of tears. I wrapped her in a blanket that we had gotten for her and brought her onto the couch for a last epic cuddle, something we were unable to do for weeks, and she was so happy to be with me, like she knew we had to savor these last moments together. I didn't sleep that night, drank coffee, watched shows, mostly just stared at and gently held my girl.

The next morning, we brought her to the vet. Our vet took a look at her and told us that we did the right thing not to pursue a more intense treatment for her, that it was surprising how quickly she deteriorated. We sat there as the vet described what was going to happen step by step and we were able to pet our girl and look into her eyes telling her how much we loved her, how she was the best cat in the world. And like that, she was gone peacefully.

I never thought my heart could break this much. I've had a lot of loss in life, animals and humans alike, but this was by far the hardest one. She was my everything, a cat who was perfect for me in every way. It was the worst seeing her suffering in her decline, and somewhat of a relief when she passed, but now there's a huge hole in my heart. Even though we have 2 other cats, who I love dearly, it's not the same without her. I know they miss her as well, especially her sister Florence, the other half of their bonded pair.

And now what? I want to be and feel more positive but moving through my grief is a Herculean effort. I go to work, do all of the things I need to do, but it seems like I can't do enough to feel fully restored. I'm living a duality of existences, one where I'm shattered from loss, unable to do anything but hurt physically, mentally, and emotionally, the other being the me that is moving on with life, investing all of my love into my husband (my best friend), and my two wonderful living cats.

Before she died, it was the ""lasts"" that were so hard, not knowing they were the last. The last time she played, the last time she looked out the window, the last time she jumped into my lap, the last time we snuggled under the covers together. Now, it's the ""firsts"" of everything that are so hard without her. The holidays are a time of high grief for everyone and it's just one of those firsts, the first holiday without her, that makes it that much harder.

On an endnote, I've had a lot of support from everyone in my life, including my incredible work colleagues who had a portrait of Rizzo commissioned, it arrived just before Christmas and is now my most treasured object. She will never be forgotten, and although I don't have a fully formed belief about the afterlife, I truly hope that there is one so that one day we can be together again.

1hq2klf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1hq2klf/pr_recommendations_rincón_and_san_juan/,PR Recommendations - Rincón and San Juan ,"I just did a 5 day trip to PR during Christmas and it was truly amazing! 

The island is safe, full of beautiful and friendly people as well as amazing scenery, beaches, food, and activities. 

We rented a car and drove from San Juan to Rincon on the day of arrival. Driving in PR is pretty straight forward especially on the well marked highways. However local streets can be winding, narrow, and full of pot holes so just be careful. It’s entirely doable so don’t hold back from getting a car - it’s totally worth it and opens up so many more activities on the island. 

DO NOT RENT A CAR FROM PRICELESS THEY ARE SCAMMERS. 

Going out west to Rincon and Aguadilla is a must!!! The beaches are the best on the island and the sunset is stunning. These are sleepy surfer towns. The water was unbelievable and the vibes overall relaxing. 

Recommendations:
On the drive over make a pit stop to eat at La llave Del Mar (amazing authentic food!!!) 
Stay @ Serenity guesthouses (parking on premise) 
Eat/drink at: 
- rincon beer company
- harbor restaurant 
- ricomini bakery 
- the English rose for breakfast (unbelievable view) 
- sana farm to table
- the beach house (good for drinks and sunset!)
- Jake’s Java (coffee beach shack) 
I’m sure there are lots of more affordable and authentic places to eat but we simply couldn’t do it all haha 

After two days out west I recommend driving along the southern route and stopping at some hikes/waterfalls or making it to el Yunque one of your days on the island. The middle of the island is mountain terrain with gorgeous hills, valleys, and woods. El Yunque is more rain forest. Best to get there early AM bc it’s packed with tourists later in the day. 

If you still have your car and can make it to a restaurant called Bacao Finca + Fogon I would totally do it. Reservations are necessary they will not seat walk ins and the place gets filled up quickly! Beautiful location!! 

Then I would end the trip in San Juan. 2-3 days in the city is more than enough. It’s vibrant and fun but the beaches aren’t the best and it gets a bit pricy. 

Recommendations: 
Stay @ wind chimes boutique hotel or sister property acacia. Staying in santurce is a great idea. It’s slightly on the quieter side and safe. You’re close enough to the party area but far enough from the heavily touristy areas of condado and old San Juan. 

Eat/drink at: 
- bebos cafe 
- cafe caleta 
- la factoria 

Definitely explore old San Juan during the day. The city is vibrant with lots of galleries and beautiful streets/ views. Ubers are cheap and easy to use in the area. Old San Juan gets very crowded for cars during peak season so I reccomend setting your drop of close to plaza colon and walking the rest of the way. 

On Saturday night we went back to old San Juan for dinner and then went to La factoria. This bar is a MUST!! It has so many different rooms and incredible drinks. Salsa dancing and house music was so memorable. The crowd is also such a vibe as all the other nearby bars seem to be servicing younger underage people. (I’m 26 btw) 

On Sunday night we went out to La Placita around 10:30 PM. This is a few streets of bars with loud music and cheap drinks. I recommend going on Sunday and doing the following for an incredible time. 1. Explore the vibes and get a mojito from el coco de Luis. 2. Walk over to taberna Los Vasquez for their live music and salsa. Then make your way over to Delavida. On Sundays only they have an INSANELY LIT live band and two floors of salsa dancing and wow the vibe is insane. $10 cover charge to enter was totally worth it and we came in with our mojitos from el coco de Luis. The vibe was so incredible and fun and lively. We danced our hearts out it was so litttt!!! 

Food in San Juan is Ok and pricey, I can’t say I have the best recommendations for that other than Bebos. 

Staying in a resort type hotel isn’t worth the money as there is so much to do and explore without that. There are some ok beaches in San Juan but the water stretching from Condado beach to playa ocean park is extremely difficult to swim in. I’m a great swimmer and I still got knocked on my ass by those waves and had to like fight for my life to get to a stretch of water that wasn’t going to kill me but still it wasn’t a relaxing swim as it was out west (where there are also large waves 
But they are much easier to navigate). 

Overall PR is amazing. Be respectful of the culture and history. Go out and meet the people and simmer in the vibes of this incredible island.

I like buying my coffee out - sue me. But fuck, why is it so hard to find a place that does consistently good coffee?

The trend’s been kicking around for a while now: experienced operators set up shop with some sickly yet oh-so-trendy branding, build a solid rep, get the books looking schmick, and then flick it to a ""new resident"" looking to fast-track their PR or citizenship. All above board—apparently. But then the staff change, the beans go rogue, and the food cabinet suddenly looks like it’s been borrowed from The Coffee Club. Next thing you know they're selling sugar syrups.

anyway, we got there and sat for a little bit and just cuddled up to each other while holding hands. it was really nice and it made me feel really comfortable and it did get rid of that awkwardness aswell.

when we got home, she messaged me saying she enjoyed it and didnt expected to just cuddle together for a little bit since she's used to other stuff happening and that she couldn't stop smiling after words and honestlybi was the same.

so yeah. I really enjoyed that date and I am hoping to go on more soon aswell, she's really cute and just makes me feel comfortable and safe.",9,1735606297.0,trans,2,0.92,False
1hq2jcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1hq2jcc/searching_for_community/,Searching for community ,"So, at 28 I've finally realised that I was gay. Apparently this is a thing with a lot of phases! You can live your whole life wondering why you're so different to every other girl around you, trying to fit in where you can, feeling terrible for not being able to, until you finally abandon the idea and start trying to understand what's going on. 
For context: I'm from the Middle East, born and raised there. And being gay isn't really an ok option, so there isn't really an open community that you can see and relate to. After I moved to the city for college, I ended up making some new friends, and some of those friends happened to be gay, and that's when things started to fall into place for me. In any case, I thought of myself as an ally and didn't think about why I liked those ppl so much. Fast forward to a few months back, I had moved again for work, and I am in Dubai atm. With some soul searching I finally understood and admitted to myself that I was simply a lesbian, and even though coming out to family isn't an option for me, I still want to meet ppl from this community here.
Not to state the obvious, but homophobia is a way of life here and that means that finding other lgbt ppl the normal way is somewhat impossible. 

So here I am on Reddit, crossing my fingers and hoping that I can find someone (or even better someone-s) who can relate to this struggle. And maybe (just maybe?) we can go out for coffee and a chat? I hope this isn't too forward, and thank you  if you've read all of that 😅 🤟",3,1735606288.0,LesbianActually,8,1.0,False

It's a chill job of repairing irrigation and cleaning up trash. One of the parks that I manage is in a not-so-nice area. It's a popular spot for the homeless to hang around and they'll try to camp out there at night. It's a fairly big-sized park so most homeless people get away with being able to sleep in there. An assortment of homeless individuals come around often; some are troublemakers and some are calm. I've got into arguments and have had to call the police department on some for doing drug and making a huge mess. It's not that I have a problem with them and I think that as a society we should do more for them but regardless some of them bring dirty needles and crack pipes. There's one in particular that assaults the homeless woman who I'm pretty sure is in jail right now. Now when I'm cleaning up litter, I'm extra careful when picking these things up, the last thing I want to hear is about someone's child or dog or whatever picking up something and accidentally overdosing or catching something. Today, I fucked up to the point that I teared up driving home after work. I pulled over and just took a big sigh. I was disappointed with myself. There's a homeless guy who I'll call Jason. Justin is a pretty nice guy, he doesn't cause trouble and doesn't leave trash everywhere. Yesterday, I was doing my routine check and I came across this stash of stuff. It was a mattress, sleeping bag, clothes, glasses, food, and a coffee maker with water in it. I left it alone seeing as most homeless eventually take their things and leave. So fast forward to today, it's still there. I left it alone again and went around my park asking people if they knew who it belonged to and if they could ask whoever it was if they could take it with them since I like to have my park free of clutter. I still got no answer so I left it alone hoping that whoever it was would take it eventually. Throughout my shift, I got a call from my supervisor who found the stuff as well. He told me that it looked abandoned and to toss it. I drove back to the spot and picked up everything. I went back to the park's shop and tossed everything away. Since we threw away a lot of garbage out city dump tosses out our stuff pretty much twice a day excluding holidays. So in the last 30 minutes of my shift, I go back to the shop to put away everything and Justin is waiting outside the shop. He explained to me that it was his stuff and if he could have it back. I said sure however the dump already took it away. I apologized to him and I was expecting him to be angry or sad but he wasn't. He apologized to me because I was the one to throw it away. My heart broke, this homeless individual wasn't upset at all and he apologized to me and I threw away all of his possessions. I fucked up so bad. I feel like a piece of shit and I'm so angry at myself. Out of all of the mistakes that I have made a work this is the biggest one and I can't stop beating myself up for it.
