I thought it was beautifully made. And it worked for what I wanted it for. I still don’t love the too dim light, but I was willing to work around that issue. 

But then I was sitting on the couch with the Move sleeping on the coffee table. It had about 48 percent charge with the screen orientation locked, WiFi off and the pen several inches away, when the thing woke up on its own. 

When I picked it up the WiFi was on and the screen orientation was unlocked. And the battery was down to 34 percent. 

I decided it was too expensive to keep with the issues I had and the weird behavior. I’ll wait until it’s a second generation and all the bugs are worked out. 

Anyone else have theirs come alive by itself? I wonder when I read about people’s being drained over night if that’s an issue that no one sees and I happened to be looking that way. ",1,1757983795.0,RemarkableTablet,0,1.0,False

Understanding Dental Hygiene Basics

Proper dental care goes far beyond simple brushing. It's a holistic approach that combines daily habits, nutrition, and professional care. Let's break down the essential components of maintaining optimal oral health:

Daily Oral Hygiene Routine

1. Brushing Techniques
• Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
• Brush for at least two minutes, twice daily
• Use gentle, circular motions
• Cover all tooth surfaces
• Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months

2. Proper Brushing Equipment
**Electric toothbrushes** can be more effective at removing plaque compared to manual brushes. Look for models with:
• Multiple brushing modes
• Pressure sensors
• Timer functions

Flossing: The Overlooked Hero of Dental Care

Many people underestimate the importance of flossing. Research shows that only 30% of Americans floss daily, despite dentists recommending it as a crucial part of oral hygiene.

Benefits of Regular Flossing:
• Removes plaque between teeth
• Prevents gum disease
• Reduces bad breath
• Prevents tartar buildup

Recommended Flossing Techniques:
• Use 18 inches of floss
• Gently slide between teeth
• Curve floss around each tooth
• Use clean sections of floss for each tooth

Nutrition and Dental Health

What you eat dramatically impacts your teeth's health. Some foods promote dental wellness, while others can cause significant damage.

Teeth-Friendly Foods:
• Calcium-rich dairy products
• Crunchy fruits and vegetables
• Lean proteins
• Water

Foods to Avoid:
• Sugary snacks
• Acidic drinks
• Sticky candies
• Excessive coffee and tea

We recently got a new general manager, let’s call her Ellie (also 21F). I’ve kind of known her for a while—we lived in the same dorm hall freshman year and have had overlapping friend groups since then.
Ellie has been in a long-term relationship for years. Like, nine years. Her boyfriend goes to school across the country, and they’ve been together since they were basically kids.
Anyway, the other night my friends and I were out and taking pictures. While we were doing that, we saw Ellie walking down the street holding hands with some guy. They were being very affectionate—until they spotted us. The second they saw our group, they dropped hands, avoided eye contact, and walked quickly past us.
We all just stood there in shock. And then, when we looked down the street again, they had rejoined hands and he even had his hand on her waist. This guy was not her boyfriend. Her boyfriend is tall and blonde; this guy was short with dark hair. I know who he is—he graduated from our school three years ago.
At first, I thought maybe she and her boyfriend had broken up. But then I checked her social media and saw she had literally posted an anniversary photo with him that same day. Like… what??
Now it’s super awkward. I went back to work after the weekend, and she’s been avoiding eye contact, blushing, and just acting really uncomfortable around me. The tension is unbearable because we both know what I saw, but neither of us is acknowledging it.
I don’t know what to do. Do I just leave it alone and pretend I saw nothing? Do I confront her about it? Do I tell her boyfriend? I hate being put in this situation but I also can’t stop thinking about it.",1,1757983077.0,TwoHotTakes,3,1.0,False
1ni35gy,https://v.redd.it/mx9v497i9fpf1,Deep Lock Quarry AKA My Temple,"Although I would have loved to show you guys more even though I never wanted to show you guys where my temple was ever period 😂 
I would hate for the secrets to die with me... And the rest of the Freemasonry who are not allowed to tell anybody. 

As usual I will post pictures of my journey in the comments below so make sure to look back later, if you don't see a bunch yet...

When my grandma passed away she left behind a bunch of her fondest memories and all of her possessions in which my mom acquired and split it up between the family... I vividly remember her inviting me over after she let everybody else have first pick and me opening up the backs of old pictures and things looking for treasure.lol

My Spidey senses were tingling and I knew that there was something there of value but till the naked eye there didn't seem to be much left other than just junk...
My mom is just about as big of a talker as I am so although I kept trying to leave she kept drawing me back in and I found myself hovering the staircase trying to get one foot out the door... 

While it was standing there I felt a tingle on my left hand. Since you guys don't know me You wouldn't know that I have EMF sickness in my left hand and I use it like Exactly that.. I walk around haunted locations and feel them out literally with my hand. I could walk around your house right now and find the haunted object easily or at the very least tell you if you have bad wiring.

So I tried to ignore it but after standing by the bottom of the steps for so long I just couldn't any longer...
I looked down to kind of investigate what is over here and I see a couple suitcases. I asked my mom what's inside of them and she said probably just some clothes. 
But I couldn't just let it go... I sat down on the floor and it actually took me like 15 minutes to figure out how to open each one of these suitcases but.. I managed. 
To my surprise there weren't clothes inside of them at all? It was filled with old photo albums...

While flipping through I remembered that she was part of a golden retriever hiking club and that their group would had not only hiked Ohio but they hiked with their dogs all across the United States... But it didn't even stop there they ended up taking the dogs to Alaska and even Australia!!!

I thought how exciting!!!! 
At first I was confused because I seen some books about my general area and wondered why she would have them? I also found a big trail map of Cuyahoga Valley National Park and surrounding area...
I had totally forgotten that she used to live in brecksville Ohio because for the last remaining years of her life she had moved to Pennsylvania. 

I asked my mom if I could take the books and the trail map and leave her the photo albums... I also took a really old ladder, a couple of wall maps (She used to be a math teacher), and some old dingy protractors.

When I got home I had friends come over and I pulled the map out trying to plan my next adventure....

I used to have a paranormal club with over 550 people in it and I would take them all out on free adventures!!!
I've always had lots of friends and I love to tell people about my paranormal experiences... And one of my favorite stories is going to a haunted covered bridge that I knew was within an hour or two of where I used to grew up inwhich was Streetsboro Ohio.

So I spread out the map And without being able to remember the name our location, I found a place called Everett Road Covered Bridge... 
I thought well it'd be really cool if we could plan a big group of people to go here but I remembered it not being really all that flashy of a bridge So I thought well I don't want to drag everybody out there for them to end up half an hour later bored and want to go home... I ended up looking around to what other places were very close by and the closest Park was Deep Lock Quarry aka lock number 28. 

So of course I Google it and I start reading the description and that it looked interesting enough to click on images... Upon scrolling through the images I started to see some out of place things. Like symbols...??? And a date on the wall that just looked unusual.

I started researching the symbol in which you can see in the video and I'm also going to post a picture of the rock too just in case for some reason you can't watch the video... It actually took me like 5 hours to figure out what that symbol meant. 

I discovered it belonged to somebody they call the Royal Arc Mason and that he belonged on the right side of the steps of Freemasonry in which would be considered to be like the blood side or royalty.. You will see the Knights Templar at the top!!!  

This person only has One job!!! He puts his stamp of approval on a rock, calls it a cornerstone, And it's placed at the Northeast corner of the temple...
He only does this when he's either opening a temple like blessing it or closing a temple like condemning it. 

This is supposed to be a quarry that was used by Quaker Oats to mine millstone's so that they could use them to roll out the oats... So why is this rock here?
It doesn't make any sense There's no plaque All there is is a little poem on a bench but as you're walking to these giant three rocks steps you will pass many many plaques talking about the different stones and things that you pass and I will share pictures of those in the comments below too...

So why would they put this rock there unless it was actually a temple? Why is there no record of a ceremony of them laying the cornerstone? When there's other publicly known ones online pretty much everywhere?? 
I ended up with 10 different reasons why I believe there's a temple there... And I was right to be suspicious of the date on the wall because I believe it to be a mathematical equation that actually takes you to another date in which is the summer solstice and it's kind of in a way giving you direction I want you need to do that day to... The sky's the limit but I say whoever made this encryption on the wall was trying to explain how to open up a portal...

Either way the history is super cool and it was definitely an important Quarry because not only did Quaker Oats use the sandstone there But it was also used to build homes... 

The Sandstone Rare!! It's called Berea Sandstone and you can pretty much shape it into anything you want hence why they made millstones (circles)...
And on top of it it's very porous and has traces of quartz crystal in it. In my opinion It could have magical properties. 
I might not be too far off because I believe that Leonardo da Vinci did tests on Berea Sandstone!!??

There are herbs there that grow wild that are native to the area meaning people brought them there to bless the place... And not only did I find a crack in the wall with air coming out of it letting me know that this thing is hollow but I also found a hole with the only tree growing on a ledge growing right in front of it in which I learned is how you bless the entrance to a temple. 

I don't think that I could fit down there and besides I don't think I would take that route because there's a big TR next to it carved in a triangle shaped crack on the wall.. It's huge and flashy. 
It could stand for treasure room or temple room or it could stand for trap? 

Okay I don't want to bounce around... But you should know that this is in Peninsula Ohio (old.. Boston Township) And although you might not have heard of peninsula you may have heard of a place called HellTown. There's a lot of different theories and stories to go along with it but I think that 98% of them are just stories. 

But one of the big things that they talk about is how people were kicked off their land because of something called Save The Forest Act... Some people theorized that there was a chemical spill and at the area became contaminated There's even stories of mutant cannibals that live in the woods.. lol

When is Quarry was active the president of the United States was William McKinley. If you don't know anything about him he only was in office for a couple years before he got shot..although he didn't die immediately, he did eventually did pass away due to supposedly gangrene.. This is really suspicious because he was actually getting better. 

When McKinley was president Teddy Roosevelt was vice president and they were both part of the Freemasonry. But McKinley was very active in it and Teddy just showed up and sat in the back with his arms crossed and was just there to maybe have the title? 

When McKinley got shot Teddy Roosevelt From what I had read, had a team of doctors and surgeons who he sent to all run to McKinley's aide and help treat him.
Assuming that he was taken care of Teddy Roosevelt left to go on a big game hunting trip that he had planned even though McKinley was laid up... To me that's suspicious. 
 
Overtime McKinley was actually getting better!! But one day the top surgeon took a train all the way to McKinley from New York to give him a check up and then by the time he arrived back in New York he had to immediately take a train back because out of nowhere McKinley took a turn for the worst?!?!


After McKinley died, Teddy Roosevelt took over all of his projects including the ones in relation to the Freemasonry. He is the person who declared save the forest act. His initials are also TR......
Teddy Roosevelt was a really flash guy, I mean this is the guy who claimed that he shot at Bigfoot and cornered him in a cave. Lol

When that act was passed it made it so that they claimed the land as government property.. And then they decided to make just Cuyahoga Valley the only national park in Ohio. Even though there are plenty of other nicer parks in Ohio they still chose that one...?
My thoughts are that there are tunnel systems coming from this underground hidden Masonic temple in which I believe is at the Quarry location.

Do I think that they created this temple? 
I mean it is possible I remember vividly 10 years ago doing the math on how much stone was mined from the quarry and then by looking at it it just really didn't look like that much was gone? 
But what I believe is they stumbled upon maybe an ancient temple underneath the place and just started utilizing it. Since they didn't know where the tunnels are let out to in return they were forced to kick everybody off their land. 

Eventually couple years after McKinley passed away that surgeon retired and after doing some research I find that 50% of people think he died from a terminal illness in which she retired because of but the other half of people claim that he passed away from a big game hunting accident...
Who else is a big game hunter?? 

Anyways...
A woman reported in some social media something that she had a wedding at a church on the same side of Riverview Road as the road that leads to deep lock that while she was getting ready she had nowhere to go in the place to change so she had to go down into the basement... She wrote that there was a tunnel down there and she thought it was odd so that's why she posted it publicly online. So at the very least there's one. 

People do report that when they venture into hell town that they are followed by a hearse scaring them away and also people have reported going to a big barn where men in black show up... Other folklore talks about a big snake that escaped from a traveling circus, a werewolf, and satanists doing rituals in the area. Along with a ghost story about a bus that's no longer sitting there from what I hear that once held a bunch of kids who all got hit by a train or died from a bus accident.. I don't know I can't remember which. 

Most of these things have been debunked or just laughed off... I did venture out when I was younger to what they call the end of the world, in that area And after leaving there we turned around in a little development that had a tiny church and there are no people although there are homes with cars it just seemed like a ghost town... Like a cup of coffee sitting there with steam still coming off of it on the ledge of a porch. 
I don't know I've never been able to find that place again. 
But it was definitely weird...

They're supposed to be a satanic church with an upside down cross but they pretty much debunk that too... 

Either way this place is filled with history, hardship, and folklore. 

So if you're ever in Ohio during the spring definitely make the trip... Right now the grass is taller than me so looking for any type of treasure or even an entrance is pretty much impossible. Not only will I be sharing pictures of my adventure today... But I'm also going to share with you pictures of what the area looks like AKA the cathedral and the mathematical equation on the wall. 

It's always possible that this mathematical equation could be more than just leading to another date and I've always felt that but I'm not a mathematician. 

So if you guys get burnt out from this treasure hunt and you want to look into this a little bit more, you're more than welcome to! 

Also before I go I wanted to tell you guys about a couple incidents that I have there.. I went there on the summer solstice and the parking lot was completely empty. 
In my group went back and we ended up climbing up on top of one of the other rock wall ledges and all the sudden out of nowhere (mind you we have not been there for more than 15 minutes) The park ranger comes up and says you're not allowed up here you got to go. We all climb down but before we do I ask him why...
He could not tell me the reason why we are not allowed up on that ledge But I can tell you... The answer is erosion. We agreed to just go back to walk in the trails and he said no you have to leave all together... And we were kind of like really weirded out by that because there's no sign saying that you're not allowed to go up there and it could have been a harmless mistake.
We ended up going back to the parking lot and which we found completely full of cars and people at picnic tables sitting there smiling and greeting us all with picnics laid out looking like they've been there for an hour. 
We had been there multiple times and we never even got a hello from somebody walking by so this was a big jump!!! 

Also another time I went there to go show my boyfriend at the time but some of the cool symbols upon those big three rock steps... While we're up there I noticed an older guy hanging around and I could tell that he was looking at us but I just continued to explain like a teacher all about this awesome history. 
All of a sudden the guy comes up and says ""sure looks like a pyramid doesn't it""?... Any smiles.
I turned my head so fast and looked him dead in the eyes and I said ""as a matter of fact sir... It Does look like a Temple""!!! 
That little bit of a smile he had on his face turned into the biggest grin I had ever seen... Because he's like in his '80s at least and at that point in time he realized that I knew!!! That was a smile of satisfaction knowing that when all these people die if they haven't already mostly already that peope have figured it out. 

I've actually never felt so proud... So if you've made it through the story I hope that you enjoyed it and if you don't care that's also cool with me. 
Either way this is my life's work and although it's not exactly paranormal This is the kind of thing that I not only live for but am good at!!! Remember that thousands of people probably walked past that rock and pointed at it and said Oh how cool and then continued walking like It was nothing... I took the time to figure it out. 

This will not be my last post tonight because we also went somewhere else today!!! Lol
Yep I took Michele down the road to the Everett Road Covered Bridge...
I'm just going to include The Covered Bridge photos that I was able to take today in this post because we didn't actually get to walk the trails... She had to go pick up her car from the shop and I got her there in time! 

But yes we went to four different places today and we are determined regardless if they match up with any type of clues or anything we are getting out and we are living our best lives!! I can't say that these places were for no reason but I can say that I'm ruling them out one by one... And I also have plans to go to every Covered Bridge in Ohio 💕

1ni3393,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ni3393/mom_used_to_hang_my_art_on_the_fridge/,Mom Used to Hang My Art on the Fridge,"When I was a kid, Mom would hang my drawings on the fridge. When I was teen, Dad would hang my drawings on the fridge. And on the walls. And on the ceiling. And on the windows.

One of my first core memories was of my Mom excitedly putting one of my drawings from school on the fridge. It was one of those typical, stick man family drawings that all kids do at some point, yet despite the mundanity of it, she was ecstatic. If her goal was to give me some sort of confidence, I guess it worked, because I spent the next 12 years drawing almost everyday.

Every year in art class the teachers would normally have 2 or 3 projects where they would get you to make something for your parents as a gift. Dad was gone most nights, meaning I never got to spend quality time with him. So most, if not all of my projects were made specifically for my Mom. I'm not kidding when I say she would put anything I gave her on the fridge. By the time I was 10, there was so many it got to the point we ended up running out of space and couldn't find strong enough magnets to keep all the papers from falling off. Wanna guess what my Mom's solution to this was? That's right. Buy another fridge.

The new fridge went in the garage and held all of my older drawings since she wanted to keep my newer stuff on display in the kitchen for everyone to see. I remember being confused about why we needed two refrigerators when we could put the old stuff in a box or a drawer, but my Dad liked the idea so I never thought much more of it. Little did I know at the time, he was only okay with it because it meant he had more room to store his beer and hide snacks he didn't want me eating on him. He told me I was banned from using the garage fridge until I turned 19, half joking that it was so I could be old enough to replace any beer that I'd inevitably drink without his permission. My Dad didn't teach me much, but when he did, It stuck.

I followed that rule like it was gospel. Whenever I had friends try to convince me to take a couple of his dozens of bottles and cans, I always refused. Even if he wasn't around much, I loved my Dad and always listened to what he said. He rarely yelled, and never hit me, but there was still a threatening aura around him whenever he was upset, and no one, including my Mom, would argue with him. Mom always said that Dad knew best, and he usually did. Life was a breeze if you did exactly as Dad requested. His sports were the only thing that I'd witness him get truly angry over.

When I was 12, we ended up moving to a new neighbourhood after my Dad got into a heated argument with our elderly neighbour beside us. Later that night I was woken up by my Mom to a loud commotion and flashing lights peaking in through my curtains. She got me dressed and brought me down stairs where we sat watching late night cartoons until my Dad came back inside. He told my Mom that the old man he was arguing with earlier had died from a heart attack. My Mom drove me to my grandparents for the night while my Dad stayed behind at the house. That single night turned into a week of no school while my parents found a new place for us to live. They wouldn't tell me why we had to move, but part of me knew it was because of our neighbour.

When we got to the new house I was allowed to pick my own room, so obviously I chose the biggest bedroom with no confrontation from my Parents. In hindsight, I knew it was because they had started sleeping in separate rooms. This didn't concern me at the time because they still kissed each other, they still hugged, and professed their love for each other every day. I never saw them argue about anything other than what they wanted to get for dinner on the weekends. Eventually I got used to it and just thought it was a normal thing all adults do as they get older.

I had to change schools when we moved, so I was all alone with no friends in a new place. I didn't take the change well, so my Mom made sure to give me extra attention whenever I got home from school. She never said it out right but I knew she knew. Things started to get a bit better after I met this cute girl in my grade. I can't seem to remember her name, but I do remember having the biggest crush on her for a while, but I was too shy to talk to her. One day when we were picking partners for a group assignment, she came up to me on her own accord to ask if I wanted to be her partner; Of course I said yes.

She was my first and only friend in this new place. Our parents became quick friends too, bringing us to each others houses on weekends to have barbecues or just to visit. We would run along the creek in the woods behind my house playing Pirate and the Princess, pretending the creek was a the sea, and that the ground on either side were opposing island kingdoms. She always wanted to play outside, especially by the creak or anywhere with water. During the summer we went to the beach a lot where we'd swim until the sun went down, eating camp fire hotdogs and marshmallows. In the winter she taught me to skate, and the best places to go sledding after a fresh snow fall. I had never been happier, and soon enough, I had forgotten about all my worries.

When I was 14 my Mom was diagnosed with a degenerative disease. She couldn't work anymore, meaning I wouldn't see my Dad awake very long for days at a time. Most nights when he came home, he would help get Mom settled in bed after giving her a bath, then go straight to bed himself. He ended up moving his mattress into her room, right next to her bed. He never wanted to be too far from her. Occasionally Dad would get sent home early from work, so Mom and I got to spend more time with him on those days, even though I could tell he would rather be in bed. On one of those rare nights, Mom had to keep nudging Dad awake on our first trip back to the movie theatres since her diagnosis. Dad, and I would spend all of our free time with Mom, especially since she needed help with almost everything nowadays, which also meant I couldn't hang out with my only best friend anymore. When our parents did meet up, it never lasted very long. Mom's social battery depletes a lot faster these days, not even able to keep her signature smile on for more than a couple of hours before she needed to rest.

Despite the circumstances, Mom still put all the art I made for her on the fridge. I started drawing a lot more after her diagnosis. In fact, I drew so much so that we completely covered the deep freezer, Dad's garage fridge, Mom's bedroom mini fridge, and the kitchen fridge with my art. I suggested framing the ones she liked the most and hanging them up around the house, but she just laughed, saying that every inch of the walls would be covered in my art if we did that. She didn't want people thinking she went ""crazy"" already.

The day I turned 16 was the last time my friend came to visit with her parents. We decided to take the trail in my back yard to the creek we used to call the seven seas. During the walk she introduced me to my first joint and we got stoned by the water. She made laugh harder than I've laughed in a long time, and life almost felt normal again. When the sun disappeared behind the tree's, I gave her my jacket as a cool autumn breeze brought us closer together. She laid her head on my shoulder, and when I turned to ask her a dumb question like 'why do leaves fall' she shut me up with a kiss. Our foreheads touched, nose to nose and we giggled incessantly until the moonlight shimmered in the creek. She whispered that she made something for me. She said it was like a lucky charm; That it would protect me as long as I kept it on me and thought of her. It was a small crocheted doll, dressed as a pirate, with a fancy mustache made of what looked like tuffs of my hair. I didn't question her, I just looked into her eyes, and she reassured me everything would be okay, kissing me on the cheek, before standing up with my hand in hers. She led me back to my place where she tried to give me my jacket back, but I said she should keep it and just give it back when I see her next. So she did. Our parents said their goodbyes, and we hugged each other one last time. I could see her sob as she waved goodbye through the rear windshield, and I cried too. It wasn't goodbye forever, but it felt like it. I gave the charm to my Mom that night, and told her it would protect her. All she needed to do was think of me.

The next morning was too quiet. It was a dull, overcast day, with a seemingly permanent fog that painted my room in a brackish hue. I shuffled myself towards the kitchen to make food but noticed my Dad softly crying in the living room. I changed course for the living room, turning the corner where I could now see he was crying into bloody hands. Without a second thought I sprinted to Mom's room, throwing the door open to see her laying peacefully in her bed. I thought I saw someone peeping in through her window from the corner of my eye, so It took me a second to notice Mom's bleeding eyes, bloodied lips, and all the viscera pooling around her head, soaking into the pillow and sheets. At first I shook her softly, then violently as she continued to not respond. I grabbed the clasped hands sitting on her chest, holding my them to my lips as I prayed to a God I didn't know. In her hands was the little Pirate charm. I knew she was thinking of me when she died.

I didn't get to see the girl for a long time. I kept the Pirate on a key chain dangling from my rear view mirror. At some point I decided I wouldn't rely on luck, so now it was just a reminder of better days that were long behind me. After months of investigation and all the wasted trials, they couldn't prove my Dad guilty. It didn't feel like a win because he was already broken. He lost his jobs almost immediately, having to go on government assistance to keep the lights on. I worked two jobs under the table and helped my Dad as best as I could during his prosecution. I didn't think he killed Mom like everyone else. The cause of death was bizarre for her condition and under most circumstances, wouldn't occur naturally. Luckily for us, that wasn't strong enough evidence to convince a jury, especially after they saw the state Dad was in. I would catch him sleep walking every night, and he was always standing in front of the fridge when I found him. I'd wake him up and he'd tell me he dreamt of Mom, showing him every new drawing she hung on the fridge, before being swept away by water and pulled into the deep sea.

Miraculously I was able to graduate high school, even while working two jobs and making sure my Dad remembered to eat food between his bouts of night terrors. A week into college I came home to find a delivery driver attempting to drop off three, brand new refrigerators, which I sent back. I asked my Dad about it, but he got angry with me for the first time in years, rambling about how Mom would be upset if she doesn't have places to hang my pictures. I stopped drawing when Mom died, but somehow, Dad found piles of old drawings that younger me considered not good enough for the fridge. I was more focused on school now and ended up reconnecting with the Princess of the creek. She said she noticed the Pirate in my windshield and wanted to see me again. We go to the same college so she waited by my car until I was done class to surprise me. We talked for hours at a coffee shop, catching each other up on our lives. Hers was perfect in comparison, so I spared her the dirty details of mine. I didn't wanna kill the mood when we're talking like we were never apart. Somehow, I do remember her name all of a sudden. It was a whisper of a sound, softly billowing in my ear. A name I couldn't disrespect by butchering it with my dreamers tongue. I lost track of time, kissing the Princess goodbye before taking off back home. While I was gone, Dad had managed to get another delivery of refrigerators set up in the kitchen, with no where for them to be plugged in. He had already completely filled one fridge with my art and was starting on the second when I caught him. He was mumbling about how Mom will be so happy to see this when she's back from work. I fell to my knees, quietly sobbing as I watched my Dad go through 4 rolls of scotch tape to cover the rest of the fridges. We both slept on the kitchen floor that night.

The morning comes fast and I'm back to my regularly scheduled programing. I struggled to move the fridges to the unused dining room, and made breakfast for both of us. While cleaning up I noticed even more drawings that I swore weren't there last night. Most were incoherent doodles or just entire pages of black scribbles. I bundled them together and threw them in the garbage while my Dad was distracted with his food. After showering myself, and getting Dad comfy in the living room with his favorite show and snacks, I left for class. When I got home every inch of the walls and ceiling were covered with the pages I had thrown out that morning. Even the windows were plastered with them, creating varying black and white collages of abstract figures and symbols. Dad was laying face up in the middle of the living room floor, surrounded in a puddle of his own urine. He was repeating lines from the bible under his breath, looking up at a collage of hundreds of eyeballs that he taped to the ceiling. He wouldn't say anything to me other than bible verses, and calling out Mom's name. He did seem to hear me, but was incapable of responding or moving a muscle unless instructed to, and even then you had to guide him with a gentle push in the right direction. For weeks after, my girlfriend would come over to help me with Dad and it took a lot of stress off of me. She was adamant on not letting me do this alone, so I couldn't stop her even If I tried. She would sleep over most nights, and even her parents came to see my Dad. We hoped it might jog his memory to reconnect with old friends but all it did was make him cry out for Mom more than he already was.

I read somewhere that cat's can be great therapy animals, so when a pregnant stray kept scratching at our back door for the scraps of food my girlfriend had been sneaking her, I suggested we just adopt her. She gave birth to the cutest litter kittens I'd ever seen, and mama cat really seemed to take a liking to my Dad. She would sit in his lap and purr endlessly when she wasn't in Mom mode. When they got big enough, we showed the babies to my Dad and for the first time in a long time, his eyes lit up. He even leaned over to give mama cat a kiss on the top of her head and said how proud he was of her. It was a beautiful, but fleeting moment of clarity for him. Later on that night, we were startled awake to what sounded like a generator being run downstairs, quickly followed by several distinct shots of what I knew to be my Dads framing nailer. We looked at eachother panicked, and bolted downstairs towards the kitchen. My girlfriend screamed as she noticed the splattering of blood on the bottom step. Standing awkwardly in the kitchen next to an air compressor, framing nailer in hand, was my Dad. He was admiring a fridge he managed to drag in from the garage, which he had nailed the baby kittens to; Miscellaneous pieces of mama cat included. He turned to us with a genuine smile on his face, and said as calm as the creek ""Ran out of tape kiddo, sorry if I woke you. Mom's gonna be so happy when she sees what we made for her!"".

I'm 25 now. We have a son of our own who's turning 3 this Autumn. He only got to see Dad a couple of times before he took his own life  by gouging out his eyes in the hospital. At least that's what they told me. Doctors said something along the lines of ""He couldn't stomach the guilt of his sins any longer"" or some bullshit I didn't care to remember. Now I'm just focusing on my career, my writing, my Princess turned Queen who gave me the Prince of my dreams. A legacy we can nurture together with our love. Something I couldn't have, something he deserves. I even started carrying the Pirate charm again. Something I used to think was just silly kid stuff now meant more to me than I could've imagined. I secretly learned to crochet and even some other neat tricks to surprise my Wife with a matching Princess for her Pirate. Complete with real hair that I snuck off the floor from when she butchered her haircut last week. She loved it, carrying it everywhere she went. For the most part, life finally settled down. A bright future was starting

1ni32jt,https://i.redd.it/2amqfq5d9fpf1.jpeg,Pourover upgraded and first time trying Gesha,"Been using an Oxo Pourover for 9 years now with mainly beans from Costco or Trader Joe’s. Few weeks ago Trader Joe’s stopped carrying the coffee I had been drinking the past two years. I tired a few of the other offerings but none were great.  So I started researching coffee to see what is out there.  Oh my, what a different world of coffee I was exposed since I heavily worked in coffee at the start of the second wave. From my research and learning about the third wave I decided to upgrade my Oxo to the V60. Of course had to get the shiny metallic version they currently have with this beautiful blue server. If I am going to use it everyday beauty and function are key.  Along with the Polaris scale to aid in brewing.  My first cup brewed was the Coava Serra do Boné. I need to fine tune my style a bit and dial it in, any suggestions welcomed. From brewing it the day before in the Oxo to the V60 was noticeably different. More nuance taste specifically the Nutella called out as a tasting profile. 

Today durning lunch I stopped at Push x Pull and they had the Columbia Gesha Spirts as pour over option. From reading about Gesha coffee  had to try it.  WOW! I have never had such a complex tasting coffee in my life before. The fruity taste that really was like Fruit Loops on the tasting profile and the hint of green tea as it colded down. It was an explosion for my taste buds during every sip.  Needless to say I am now hooked on this new coffee journey and excited to explore and find out what my preferences are. I know bright forward coffees are not my cup of brew.  So any suggestion that are on the opposite spectrum from that are welcomed.  ",4,1757982775.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

One day when we were picking partners for a group assignment, she came up to me on her own accord to ask if I wanted to be her partner; Of course I said yes.

She was my first and only friend in this new place. Our parents became quick friends too, bringing us to each others houses on weekends to have barbecues or just to visit. We would run along the creek in the woods behind my house playing Pirate and the Princess, pretending the creek was a the sea, and that the ground on either side were opposing island kingdoms. She always wanted to play outside, especially by the creak or anywhere with water. During the summer we went to the beach a lot where we'd swim until the sun went down, eating camp fire hotdogs and marshmallows. In the winter she taught me to skate, and the best places to go sledding after a fresh snow fall. I had never been happier, and soon enough, I had forgotten about all my worries.

When I was 14 my Mom was diagnosed with a degenerative disease. She couldn't work anymore, meaning I wouldn't see my Dad awake very long for days at a time. Most nights when he came home, he would help get Mom settled in bed after giving her a bath, then go straight to bed himself. He ended up moving his mattress into her room, right next to her bed. He never wanted to be too far from her. Occasionally Dad would get sent home early from work, so Mom and I got to spend more time with him on those days, even though I could tell he would rather be in bed. On one of those rare nights, Mom had to keep nudging Dad awake on our first trip back to the movie theatres since her diagnosis. Dad, and I would spend all of our free time with Mom, especially since she needed help with almost everything nowadays, which also meant I couldn't hang out with my only best friend anymore. When our parents did meet up, it never lasted very long. Mom's social battery depletes a lot faster these days, not even able to keep her signature smile on for more than a couple of hours before she needed to rest.

Despite the circumstances, Mom still put all the art I made for her on the fridge. I started drawing a lot more after her diagnosis. In fact, I drew so much so that we completely covered the deep freezer, Dad's garage fridge, Mom's bedroom mini fridge, and the kitchen fridge with my art. I suggested framing the ones she liked the most and hanging them up around the house, but she just laughed, saying that every inch of the walls would be covered in my art if we did that. She didn't want people thinking she went ""crazy"" already.

The day I turned 16 was the last time my friend came to visit with her parents. We decided to take the trail in my back yard to the creek we used to call the seven seas. During the walk she introduced me to my first joint and we got stoned by the water. She made laugh harder than I've laughed in a long time, and life almost felt normal again. When the sun disappeared behind the tree's, I gave her my jacket as a cool autumn breeze brought us closer together. She laid her head on my shoulder, and when I turned to ask her a dumb question like 'why do leaves fall' she shut me up with a kiss. Our foreheads touched, nose to nose and we giggled incessantly until the moonlight shimmered in the creek. She whispered that she made something for me. She said it was like a lucky charm; That it would protect me as long as I kept it on me and thought of her. It was a small crocheted doll, dressed as a pirate, with a fancy mustache made of what looked like tuffs of my hair. I didn't question her, I just looked into her eyes, and she reassured me everything would be okay, kissing me on the cheek, before standing up with my hand in hers. She led me back to my place where she tried to give me my jacket back, but I said she should keep it and just give it back when I see her next. So she did. Our parents said their goodbyes, and we hugged each other one last time. I could see her sob as she waved goodbye through the rear windshield, and I cried too. It wasn't goodbye forever, but it felt like it. I gave the charm to my Mom that night, and told her it would protect her. All she needed to do was think of me.

The next morning was too quiet. It was a dull, overcast day, with a seemingly permanent fog that painted my room in a brackish hue. I shuffled myself towards the kitchen to make food but noticed my Dad softly crying in the living room. I changed course for the living room, turning the corner where I could now see he was crying into bloody hands. Without a second thought I sprinted to Mom's room, throwing the door open to see her laying peacefully in her bed. I thought I saw someone peeping in through her window from the corner of my eye, so It took me a second to notice Mom's bleeding eyes, bloodied lips, and all the viscera pooling around her head, soaking into the pillow and sheets. At first I shook her softly, then violently as she continued to not respond. I grabbed the clasped hands sitting on her chest, holding my them to my lips as I prayed to a God I didn't know. In her hands was the little Pirate charm. I knew she was thinking of me when she died.

I didn't get to see the girl for a long time. I kept the Pirate on a key chain dangling from my rear view mirror. At some point I decided I wouldn't rely on luck, so now it was just a reminder of better days that were long behind me. After months of investigation and all the wasted trials, they couldn't prove my Dad guilty. It didn't feel like a win because he was already broken. He lost his jobs almost immediately, having to go on government assistance to keep the lights on. I worked two jobs under the table and helped my Dad as best as I could during his prosecution. I didn't think he killed Mom like everyone else. The cause of death was bizarre for her condition and under most circumstances, wouldn't occur naturally. Luckily for us, that wasn't strong enough evidence to convince a jury, especially after they saw the state Dad was in. I would catch him sleep walking every night, and he was always standing in front of the fridge when I found him. I'd wake him up and he'd tell me he dreamt of Mom, showing him every new drawing she hung on the fridge, before being swept away by water and pulled into the deep sea.

Miraculously I was able to graduate high school, even while working two jobs and making sure my Dad remembered to eat food between his bouts of night terrors. A week into college I came home to find a delivery driver attempting to drop off three, brand new refrigerators, which I sent back. I asked my Dad about it, but he got angry with me for the first time in years, rambling about how Mom would be upset if she doesn't have places to hang my pictures. I stopped drawing when Mom died, but somehow, Dad found piles of old drawings that younger me considered not good enough for the fridge. I was more focused on school now and ended up reconnecting with the Princess of the creek. She said she noticed the Pirate in my windshield and wanted to see me again. We go to the same college so she waited by my car until I was done class to surprise me. We talked for hours at a coffee shop, catching each other up on our lives. Hers was perfect in comparison, so I spared her the dirty details of mine. I didn't wanna kill the mood when we're talking like we were never apart. Somehow, I do remember her name all of a sudden. It was a whisper of a sound, softly billowing in my ear. A name I couldn't disrespect by butchering it with my dreamers tongue. I lost track of time, kissing the Princess goodbye before taking off back home. While I was gone, Dad had managed to get another delivery of refrigerators set up in the kitchen, with no where for them to be plugged in. He had already completely filled one fridge with my art and was starting on the second when I caught him. He was mumbling about how Mom will be so happy to see this when she's back from work. I fell to my knees, quietly sobbing as I watched my Dad go through 4 rolls of scotch tape to cover the rest of the fridges. We both slept on the kitchen floor that night.

The morning comes fast and I'm back to my regularly scheduled programing. I struggled to move the fridges to the unused dining room, and made breakfast for both of us. While cleaning up I noticed even more drawings that I swore weren't there last night. Most were incoherent doodles or just entire pages of black scribbles. I bundled them together and threw them in the garbage while my Dad was distracted with his food. After showering myself, and getting Dad comfy in the living room with his favorite show and snacks, I left for class. When I got home every inch of the walls and ceiling were covered with the pages I had thrown out that morning. Even the windows were plastered with them, creating varying black and white collages of abstract figures and symbols. Dad was laying face up in the middle of the living room floor, surrounded in a puddle of his own urine. He was repeating lines from the bible under his breath, looking up at a collage of hundreds of eyeballs that he taped to the ceiling. He wouldn't say anything to me other than bible verses, and calling out Mom's name. He did seem to hear me, but was incapable of responding or moving a muscle unless instructed to, and even then you had to guide him with a gentle push in the right direction. For weeks after, my girlfriend would come over to help me with Dad and it took a lot of stress off of me. She was adamant on not letting me do this alone, so I couldn't stop her even If I tried. She would sleep over most nights, and even her parents came to see my Dad. We hoped it might jog his memory to reconnect with old friends but all it did was make him cry out for Mom more than he already was.

I read somewhere that cat's can be great therapy animals, so when a pregnant stray kept scratching at our back door for the scraps of food my girlfriend had been sneaking her, I suggested we just adopt her. She gave birth to the cutest litter kittens I'd ever seen, and mama cat really seemed to take a liking to my Dad. She would sit in his lap and purr endlessly when she wasn't in Mom mode. When they got big enough, we showed the babies to my Dad and for the first time in a long time, his eyes lit up. He even leaned over to give mama cat a kiss on the top of her head and said how proud he was of her. It was a beautiful, but fleeting moment of clarity for him. Later on that night, we were startled awake to what sounded like a generator being run downstairs, quickly followed by several distinct shots of what I knew to be my Dads framing nailer. We looked at eachother panicked, and bolted downstairs towards the kitchen. My girlfriend screamed as she noticed the splattering of blood on the bottom step. Standing awkwardly in the kitchen next to an air compressor, framing nailer in hand, was my Dad. He was admiring a fridge he managed to drag in from the garage, which he had nailed the baby kittens to; Miscellaneous pieces of mama cat included. He turned to us with a genuine smile on his face, and said as calm as the creek ""Ran out of tape kiddo, sorry if I woke you. Mom's gonna be so happy when she sees what we made for her!"".

I'm 25 now. We have a son of our own who's turning 3 this Autumn. He only got to see Dad a couple of times before he took his own life  by gouging out his eyes in the hospital. At least that's what they told me. Doctors said something along the lines of ""He couldn't stomach the guilt of his sins any longer"" or some bullshit I didn't care to remember. Now I'm just focusing on my career, my writing, my Princess turned Queen who gave me the Prince of my dreams. A legacy we can nurture together with our love. Something I couldn't have, something he deserves. I even started carrying the Pirate charm again. Something I used to think was just silly kid stuff now meant more to me than I could've imagined. I secretly learned to crochet and even some other neat tricks to surprise my Wife with a matching Princess for her Pirate. Complete with real hair that I snuck off the floor from when she butchered her haircut last week. She loved it, carrying it everywhere she went. For the most part, life finally settled down. A bright future was starting

Another guy talked to me in coffeeshop about photo editing. He asked if he could get the edited photos I used as demo and I gave my number with caution. I said I don’t use text btw (lied). Every so often he asks if I’m free or ‘Wanna coffee?’, happened for several days. Blocked the number today.

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine—then yes, I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

Also worth mentioning: I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

1ni2xhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ni2xhc/mom_used_to_hang_my_art_on_the_fridge/,Mom Used To Hang My Art on the Fridge,"When I was a kid, Mom would hang my drawings on the fridge. When I was teen, Dad would hang my drawings on the fridge. And on the walls. And on the ceiling. And on the windows.

One of my first core memories was of my Mom excitedly putting one of my drawings from school on the fridge. It was one of those typical, stick man family drawings that all kids do at some point, yet despite the mundanity of it, she was ecstatic. If her goal was to give me some sort of confidence, I guess it worked, because I spent the next 12 years drawing almost everyday.

Every year in art class the teachers would normally have 2 or 3 projects where they would get you to make something for your parents as a gift. Dad was gone most nights, meaning I never got to spend quality time with him. So most, if not all of my projects were made specifically for my Mom. I'm not kidding when I say she would put anything I gave her on the fridge. By the time I was 10, there was so many it got to the point we ended up running out of space and couldn't find strong enough magnets to keep all the papers from falling off. Wanna guess what my Mom's solution to this was? That's right. Buy another fridge.

The new fridge went in the garage and held all of my older drawings since she wanted to keep my newer stuff on display in the kitchen for everyone to see. I remember being confused about why we needed two refrigerators when we could put the old stuff in a box or a drawer, but my Dad liked the idea so I never thought much more of it. Little did I know at the time, he was only okay with it because it meant he had more room to store his beer and hide snacks he didn't want me eating on him. He told me I was banned from using the garage fridge until I turned 19, half joking that it was so I could be old enough to replace any beer that I'd inevitably drink without his permission. My Dad didn't teach me much, but when he did, It stuck.

I followed that rule like it was gospel. Whenever I had friends try to convince me to take a couple of his dozens of bottles and cans, I always refused. Even if he wasn't around much, I loved my Dad and always listened to what he said. He rarely yelled, and never hit me, but there was still a threatening aura around him whenever he was upset, and no one, including my Mom, would argue with him. Mom always said that Dad knew best, and he usually did. Life was a breeze if you did exactly as Dad requested. His sports were the only thing that I'd witness him get truly angry over.

When I was 12, we ended up moving to a new neighbourhood after my Dad got into a heated argument with our elderly neighbour beside us. Later that night I was woken up by my Mom to a loud commotion and flashing lights peaking in through my curtains. She got me dressed and brought me down stairs where we sat watching late night cartoons until my Dad came back inside. He told my Mom that the old man he was arguing with earlier had died from a heart attack. My Mom drove me to my grandparents for the night while my Dad stayed behind at the house. That single night turned into a week of no school while my parents found a new place for us to live. They wouldn't tell me why we had to move, but part of me knew it was because of our neighbour.

When we got to the new house I was allowed to pick my own room, so obviously I chose the biggest bedroom with no confrontation from my Parents. In hindsight, I knew it was because they had started sleeping in separate rooms. This didn't concern me at the time because they still kissed each other, they still hugged, and professed their love for each other every day. I never saw them argue about anything other than what they wanted to get for dinner on the weekends. Eventually I got used to it and just thought it was a normal thing all adults do as they get older.

I had to change schools when we moved, so I was all alone with no friends in a new place. I didn't take the change well, so my Mom made sure to give me extra attention whenever I got home from school. She never said it out right but I knew she knew. Things started to get a bit better after I met this cute girl in my grade. I can't seem to remember her name, but I do remember having the biggest crush on her for a while, but I was too shy to talk to her. One day when we were picking partners for a group assignment, she came up to me on her own accord to ask if I wanted to be her partner; Of course I said yes.

I made a new account for this post, because friends and family may have my main account. Please bear with me. I’m more of a lurker than a poster and hope I’ve followed the rules. I have been writing this post on my phone for about two weeks, and debating every day if I should post. So if you’re seeing this, I guess I made up my mind.

Earlier this year, I (50f) and my husband (51m) agreed to take in our youngest daughter’s (18f) friend Charlie (19m) when we found out he was basically living on the street in winter. At the time, we said he could stay for a few days.

I need to give some context. I know I’m about to be vague with some details involving Charlie’s background but I want to protect his privacy as much as possible. 

Charlie’s mom is an unfit, abusive, neglectful piece of trash. I won’t get into specifics, but her actions should have landed her in jail, or at the very least without her kids. As far as I know, there wasn’t any sexual abuse, but think about a dozen other types of abuse and a dozen ways a parent can neglect a child and you’ll probably nail at least half of the things she subjected her son to. Since Child Services was already involved, they always scheduled their visits and never caught her in the abuse and/or neglect. Charlie never reported these things to them either. The police were called sometimes, but they also never really intervened. I think Charlie kept quiet because this kind of life had been normalized for him, and his extended family behaves very similarly.  Occasionally Charlie’s mom would be nice to him and things would seem fine, but the cycle always repeated itself.

At some point last year his mom just up and disappeared. Charlie bounced from one dysfunctional relative to another. Like I said, they were like his mother, mentally ill, mean spirited, neglectful, etc. This is how he ended up homeless. My daughter was upset and scared for him. My husband and I knew his background and weren’t completely heartless, so we agreed Charlie could come stay with us. At the time, my husband and I said “a few days.” But Charlie was only 18 at the time, hadn’t completed high school, was unemployed, and broke. So we didn’t specify an end date, because we knew he would need some time to make and save money. 

Immediately, I sat with Charlie and helped him come up with plans to be able to take care of himself. We discussed many goals, including but not limited to his education, transportation, getting a job and saving as much money as possible. It’s harder than ever for young people to become independent, so we didn’t ask for money and he had 100 percent access to our fridge and pantry. The only things we asked for in return was for him to keep the living room tidy, which was where he was staying, and to clean up after himself, and maybe help with some heavy lifting from time to time. Most importantly, we encouraged him to spend wisely and to SAVE. 

It took him a couple months to start working, and that’s only because I had to light a fire under him. I took off many hours of work to help him get to interviews, for physicals, and other stuff he needed for a new job. For the first couple months, we were the ones driving him to and from work before a coworker started to give him a ride. At first I noticed he was spending money on fast food, buying stuff for his gf, and other nonsense. I let the food slide because he really wasn’t eating ours, and I get it. He’s young and just got his first job so he went a little crazy with the spending, so I didn’t say anything the first couple paychecks. He hadn’t had a normal teenage life and I wanted him to have some enjoyment. I talked to him again about saving money, opening a bank account, and the other goals we’d discussed. Charlie seemed to be on track for a time, but to be honest there were some other things that started to bother us, even my daughter.

Even though the living room is essentially his bedroom, it is still our living room. It is still the first space people see upon entering our home and the main area where the family used to come together before he came. We have to pass through the living room to get to other areas of the house. Charlie isn’t treating the space as a shared space. He constantly leaves food and trash lying around, and is generally messy, despite many conversations about this. Me, my husband or daughter will clean the living room and tidy up his clothes and other things, and he’ll leave it messy again the same day. I understand what it’s like not to have your own space to store personal things, but you can still be neat about it. 

He rarely showers, so the living room always smells like BO. He barely washes his clothes, which contributes to the unpleasant smell in the living room. In addition, he always smells strongly of weed, and sometimes we can smell it throughout the house. We don’t care if he smokes before he comes here, but we don’t smoke, and we don’t like the smell, especially when it’s attached to unwashed clothes. Because he doesn’t bathe regularly, he often leaves literal dirt, pubes, and I don’t even want to guess what else behind on the toilet. This is particularly infuriating because how do you not notice that?!

During the day and early evenings, or anytime everyone is home, he lounges across the couch under his blanket, so no one feels comfortable being in the living room or even just passing through. Short-term, none of this really matters, but it has been almost a year. I haven’t been able to really have company over, because the living room is occupied by Charlie and his stuff, and it smells. 

Periodically, I asked Charlie how saving and planning was going. He had done nothing on the education front, which was frustrating because I’d given him several FREE resources to accomplish this. But I didn’t nag about that because it seemed like he was at least saving money and actively looking for a roommate to move in with or a small apartment. I reminded him that the current living situation is temporary and not something that could be longterm. We do rent, but my landlord is most likely to sell at any time. We are actively looking for a new home, and with rent prices so high these days, we will not be able to accommodate another adult. Plus, I don’t know how my landlord would feel about us allowing someone else to live here. 

Also, I want to mention that my daughter has a major depressive disorder and major anxiety disorder. She feels trapped in her bedroom and isolated because she can’t hang out in the living room with me and her dad or have a friend over, or just sit on the couch to watch a movie. It’s hard kitchen chairs or her bedroom right now when she’s not in class. Her mental health is taking a hit.

Weekends are especially frustrating because Charlie stays up or out all night and sleeps all day on the couch. Meanwhile I’m trying to clean the house and whatnot and he makes no effort to get out of the way. 

A couple months ago Charlie started to disappear for days, and sometimes as much as a week at a time and seemed to be struggling financially. I asked him if he’d found somewhere else to live, because if so, he needed to come get all of his stuff. I got a lot of nonsensical answers, but he ultimately said he was still living with us. However, I wasn’t getting straight answers on his financial situation. As it turned out, his mother had reappeared, and he had been giving her money and spending money for her. It pissed me off because I knew eventually she would toss him aside like trash again, as she’d been doing for years. It also pissed me off because we didn’t do all of this for him to take care of his mom. 

Recently, I finally outright asked Charlie how much money he’s saved, and the answer is NONE. Yes, you read that correctly. Zero dollars. In fact, he’s now in debt that he hadn’t had before. He has nothing and nothing to show for what he’s spent. I again reminded him that this was never supposed to be a longterm thing. This time he said “I’m about to start saving.” I heard a lot of “I was gonna” and “I was about to.” That made it easier to tell Charlie he has a couple months to move out.  

We are not well off. My husband and I both work full-time with side hustles and still struggle to get by. Here we are looking for more earning potential to stay afloat in this economy, and Charlie has apparently been doing the very least he can do to help himself. Charlie’s lack of motivation or whatever it is feels like a slap in the face. We don’t have much and were willing to share it anyway to help him, but he hasn’t been helping himself. He has nothing to show for his seven months of work, not one thing. I feel bad for making him leave, but I feel like Charlie has taken advantage of us, even if he didn’t do it on purpose. There is no reason he shouldn’t have any money saved, or have even picked up a second job by now to help his situation. Oh, by the way, his mom did flip her switch again, and they’re not talking. 

For the record, we have three other children besides the 18yo. When our kids started working, they wanted to contribute to the household in some way, but we strongly encouraged them to save money. One kid just paid for his cell phone and car insurance in addition to $25/mo rent. Another didn’t pay rent but paid her car insurance and bought household supplies like cleaning supplies, etc. The oldest paid around $250-$300/mo at a time when he planned to stay home long term - it was his decision to pay that amount. That helped with food, power, internet, cell, etc. and we often took him back and forth to work. The moment he decided he was going to try to get his own place and buy a car, we stopped taking his money. We wanted to be sure that when our kids were ready to leave the nest they had the money to do so with some tucked away - and they did! They have done great! I mention all this to show that my kids were able to save money when living at home, while contributing in some way, even on minimum wage. They worked second jobs or changed employment and did whatever they needed to do. We didn’t ask Charlie for ANY monetary contributions, giving him the opportunities that even our own kids didn’t have, and he squandered it. 

Like I said, I’ve been typing this out for some time. Now I have to mention a newer development. In the past week, Charlie has missed two days of work, not including time he missed BEFORE our conversation. He has stayed out until 3am or later and overslept by hours. He has to be at work by 6:30 and would still be sleeping when I came out of my office for coffee around ten. If someone would have told me I have two months to find somewhere else to live, I don’t think I’d be slacking off at work. 

I am beginning to feel more irritation than empathy at this point. Earlier I spoke about my daughter’s mental health, but I know my own mental health won’t be able to deal with a jobless adult sitting on my couch day and night, eating my food because they won’t have money for their own, not bathing or washing their clothes, and slowing down my internet while I’m working. 

The more I type, the less of an A-Hole I feel I am, and I’m usually pretty honest with myself when I am being one. And I am OFTEN an A-Hole. But maybe I’m not seeing it clearly. I hate feeling like I’m throwing a young kid out into the streets. Yet, if someone else was in my shoes, I would say “He’s not your responsibility .” Ugh.

What do you think? Are we the A-holes? Could we have done anything differently?

Likes: Horror movies, metal/pop punk long walks on the beach (kidding), DnD (never played but wanna), RPGs, MMOs, occult-y things, comics, 3d printing, ADHD fueled deep dives into random topics and conspiracy theories, tattoos, cosplay, uh....coffee. Yeah I think that covers it.

1ni2v2b,https://i.redd.it/gcxsfpyo7fpf1.jpeg,"MacBook Pro Late 2023 liquid damage: cleaned it, now it boots but needs macOS restore. Advice needed please!","Summary: I spilled coffee on my MacBook Pro (Late 2023) and some liquid entered through the right-side vents. I opened it, cleaned with alcohol, let it dry, and reassembled it. The Mac now powers on but only asks me to restore macOS. I can still access and back up the drive in Target Disk Mode. My questions: if I restore macOS, will my files and settings remain? And with AppleCare+, should I bring it to an apple store if it still works?

I messed up earlier when a cup of coffee (cappuccino so it had tons of sugar) spilled on the table. My MacBook Pro was close by, and some coffee went inside through the right-side vents/speaker.

I immediately lifted the left side of the MacBook so liquid could drain out the right. After it dried a bit, I tried turning it on, but it said “disk not found.”

I turned it off, opened the back panel, and found coffee stains from the speaker area down toward the SD card slot (marked in red in the photo). I disconnected the battery, cleaned the area with 70% isopropyl alcohol, and lifted the screw and flex cable to clean underneath. I didn’t remove the whole board, but I wiped away as much coffee as I could.

Then I left it to dry with silica gel packs and a fan.

After reassembling, the MacBook turned on, but now it only asks me to restore macOS. The drive itself seems fine — I can access and back it up using Target Disk Mode.

So I have two questions:
	1.	Immediate question: How do I get my Mac running again? If I restore macOS, will my files and settings still be there?
	2.	Later question: I have AppleCare+. Since the Mac is turning on, is it worth bringing it to Apple for a check-up? I’m not in the U.S. right now, so no Apple Store nearby — only authorized retailers. Should I trust them, or wait until I’m back in the States for the Genius Bar?

1ni2v20,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ni2v20/friends_dismissed_my_birthday_i_confronted_them/,"Friends dismissed my birthday, I confronted them, and now I feel conflicted","A few weeks ago I organized my own birthday — escape room, dinner, and maybe clubbing. Before dinner, two of my friends came shopping with me. While we were having coffee, they casually told me they didn’t have time to get me a birthday present, laughed about it together, and then suggested maybe they’d just pay for a dress I was already planning to buy. The way they said it felt dismissive, like it wasn’t a big deal.

I didn’t say anything in the moment because I didn’t want to ruin the mood, but later I reflected and told them it hurt my feelings. For other birthdays in our group, we’ve gone out of our way to plan thoughtful gifts and even surprised one friend with cake. I had given them three weeks’ notice for mine, yet they still didn’t try. To me, offering to pay for the dress felt like a low-effort “save face” move, not genuine effort.

Fast forward: one of the girls confronted me weeks later, saying she had put effort in by suggesting shopping, and then justified herself by saying birthdays aren’t a big deal to her. I explained that even if birthdays don’t matter to her, they do matter to me — and friendship means showing up for each other in ways that the other person values. She didn’t seem to get it, and her “apology” was basically, “I’m sorry you feel that way.”

This whole thing has made me realize I get attached too quickly and assume acquaintances are closer friends than they are. I’m trying to figure out how to protect myself from getting disappointed when people don’t treat me with the same care I give them.

My question is: How do I keep building connections without over-attaching or having expectations that leave me hurt when people don’t show up the way I do?",2,1757982213.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I ordered a jalapeño bagel with butter and potato wedges, something I usually get at Tims.

This time, I paid close attention to how it was being prepared. Two employees were working on orders, but what shocked me was that the employee making the food did not change their gloves between different orders. For most people, this might not be a big issue, but as a Muslim, this is problematic since there’s a real risk of cross-contamination with non-Halal ingredients and other products.

After my order was made, I saw the same employee (with the same gloves) preparing an order with bacon. Because of this, I chose not to eat the bagel I had ordered. As for the wedges, they weren’t handled by hand but rather with a scooper.

I completely understand that the majority of people on campus aren’t Muslim and don’t follow dietary laws. But for those who do, whether Halal, Kosher, or otherwise, please be cautious when eating at places like this. Personally, unless it’s coffee or other items with a lower risk of cross-contamination, I’d recommend being careful with what you order.

1ni2t90,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ni2t90/my_grandpa_met_a_strange_man/,My Grandpa Met a Strange Man,"The wind was full of humidity as I tore down the Indiana gravel road in my 2003 Chevy Impala. In my rear view mirror, thunderclouds gathered like artillery ready for battle, and the first flashes of lightning hit the ground at regular intervals. The cornfields rippled like waves. The sky’s greenish hue made the world feel alien, and the dust cloud behind me made it seem like the ground itself was trying to escape the storm.

I turned onto a small dirt driveway and parked in front of a white two story farmhouse. Shielding my eyes, I grabbed my duffle bag from the front seat and bounded up the three stairs, closing the whipping screen door behind me.

My grandpa was seated in his chair in the living room watching Hogan’s Heroes. His dinner plate sat next to him, remnants of tater tot casserole speckling it.

He adjusted his ninety-two-year-old frame to turn and see me, then stood at a snail’s pace to offer a greeting. “Alice, how are you, my girl?”

“I’m doing good, grandpa, how are you?”

“Oh, just dandy. You got so tall,” he said, hunched shoulders raising to their limits to give me a hug. Thick arthritic fingers patted my back, hands now more like claws than hands. My grandpa had been a farmer all his life. When none of his kids wanted to take the farm over, he just kept working, selling off land piece by piece to pay for his meager living. Even now, he still kept a garden with cabbage, peppers, onions, rhubarb, and a few tomato plants. Three chickens gave him an egg for every morning’s breakfast, and a neighbor brought him milk every week. He was a simple man.

“How’s school going for ya?” His voice was gruff, yet joyful.

“I’m all graduated now.”

“Really!”

“Yep, got a job and everything.”

“That’s wonderful. Where at?”

“It’s in Washington State. That’s where I’m headed now if you can believe it.”

“Really? That’s a long drive.”

“Well that’s why I’m staying with you. Break it up a little bit. I’m visiting national parks and staying with friends too.”

“Oh wow. That sounds super. Well, if you need anything to eat, I’ve got tater tot casserole on the stove.”

I helped myself to a plate and sat on a lightly dusted sofa across from my grandpa. I told him all about school, and he told me about life in town. The bakery he went to every morning for the same burnt coffee had changed ownership, and now the rolls he brought home for Saturday lunch were sourdough, which he liked. His coffee group was now significantly smaller, as at least three of them had died and two had moved into assisted living. It was a whirlwind of names I didn’t know, yet somehow my grandpa recounting their life stories made it feel like they were old friends of mine too.

Conversation grew sparse after an hour, and grandpa was getting tired. The wind outside the house eventually triumphed over the TV as the primary background noise. The storm clouds churned as the front got closer to the house. As the wind gusted, it swayed and bounced the old power lines running to the house and barn. It made a strange, twanging sound, reverberating in the turbulent air.

My grandpa perked up at the sound. The lines in his face shifted as he turned to the window enough to see the trees whipping around them.

“He’s on the lines.” His usual content tone melted away.

“What was that grandpa?”

He turned to me with a tired face that looked older than ever. With a thoughtful ponderance I had never associated with him when I was a child, he told me the strangest story I’ve ever heard.

“When I got back from the war, I bought this house, and your grandmother and I had our own little slice of paradise, it felt like, before kids came along. Not that that wasn’t paradise, too. Just a little noisier.

Well with my pension I had a mind to buy me a tractor and so I did. It was a beauty of a thing, Minneapolis Moline, white with yellow stripes, 37 horsepower. Got it second hand, but it served me real well. Our neighbor Frank had an older one that went caput, and he just used it for parts. Said I could use anything from it if I needed.

I was out in the field planting in May when a hose on the back broke. I knew Frank had the part and I was fairly close to his farm, so I decided to walk on up the gravel road to get there. Did you come from town or from the highway?”

“Town,” I said.

“Ok, if you came from the highway you’d have passed it. I was making my way back to the tractor with the hose when I walked up over a slight hill and saw a man walking toward me on the gravel road.

He sure was peculiar looking. Even though the summer heat had just started, he was wearing a black suit and a bow-tie. His shoes were covered in dust, but I could tell they had been shined recently. At first, I thought he mighta been some traveling preacher or something, but he didn’t carry no Bible nor a suitcase. Instead, he was dragging this steel T-post of sorts. It was like two sections of four inch pipe, one welded to the middle of the other one. I thought it mighta been a tractor component of some sort, though I’ve never seen anything like it.

When I finally got close enough to say good afternoon, I could see he had this greasy jet-black hair, done up with pomade so not one strand was out of place. When I called out to him, he gave me a smile with teeth as white as a sheet, and his eyes were something deep brown. In the afternoon sun, his face didn’t have no sweat on it. Real strange. He called back to me in a sort of sing-songy way.

‘Good afternoon, mister.’ He sounded like he had a voice for a pulpit, full, but not too deep and booming.

‘What are you up to, sir?’ I said back. We were now a few paces away. The sound of gravel grating against that pipe had stopped by that point, which I was glad for.

He said, ‘I’m just a-walkin the road, mister. Looking for something or someone.’

‘Whatcha looking for?’ I said. ‘You lost?’

‘No, no, not lost,’ he said ‘Just wandering. Wondering while I wander.’

So I asked ‘You a preacher?’ He kept smiling at me, so I figured maybe he had some holy disposition. But he shook his head and said ‘No, not by profession, but perhaps related to it.’

Now he was looking over at the power lines. They were running along hundred foot between posts, set horizontal across the top bar, and there was the landline too. So I asked him ‘You a lineman?’

‘No,’ he said, still grinning.

I kinda half laughed at the thought of a strangely dressed fellow wandering around not knowing what he was looking for. ‘Then whatcha doing out here?’ I asked him.

He turned to me and raised an eyebrow. ‘I’m looking for a name.’

Something in his tone made me tense up a little bit, so I just asked him ‘Like looking for somebody? Wanting to know who lives around here?’

But he just went on like he didn’t know what I was saying. ‘Oh, perhaps,’ he said. ‘I’m just in need of a name.’

And with that, he hoisted up that T-post and planted it in the loose gravel at his feet. Somehow it stayed upright. The top bar sat a little above our heads, and in a quick step he jumped up so he was hanging on it, back to the post, arms wrapped around each side of the top bar. He crossed his legs and hung there, grinning at me. That trick was strange. Something about him looking down at me didn’t feel right.

So I asked him ‘Where’d you learn a trick like that?’ He hopped down, but that T-post stayed put.

‘When you have time to wait, you have time to balance.’ He gave a little half bow and looked at me like I was supposed to clap or something. Then he asked me, ‘You been in the army, mister?’

I said I had, and he asked me where. I told him about the Pacific and his eyes sorta lit up at every detail I was giving him. After a bit, I got feeling so strange I just stopped in the middle of a sentence. He kept looking at me, then he asked ‘Did you find your service worthwhile?’

Seemed like kind of a strange question, but I said ‘Well I say it’s what I had to do.’

He started parroting me, going ‘Mmm, yes, what I had to do.’

So I asked ‘You ever been in the service?’

He perked up again. Wouldn’t give me a straight answer. ‘In a sort of way, yes. The service has treated me mighty fine.’ He knocked on the T-post, caught it as it started to tip over, and then set it back up. Then he kept talking, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

His smile was making me uncomfortable. I watched him pull himself up to the top of the T-post and sit there on the middle of it. I was waiting for him to tip over, but then he hoisted himself up to his feet, and by Jove, he was walking along the top beam like some kinda tight rope. So I said, ‘You from the circus?’

He looked at me, standing on that beam, smiling like a loon, and said, ‘You might call it a bit of a circus. Maybe as chaotic as one.’ He jumped down and landed like a cat.

It was then that I realized how late in the day it was getting, and that the sun had been swallowed up by some clouds on the western horizon. They were big ol’ storm clouds, and it sure looked like rain. So I said that it looks like rain and that I might be needing to go. His eyebrows shot up at that, and I got scared he might follow me. Didn’t know how I’d get away, considering the tractor was busted and it was almost a straight shot back to the house. I didn’t want to try and outrun him neither. So I just figured I’d keep talking until he decided to leave. ‘You afraid of getting caught in the storm?’ I said.

‘No, I love a good storm,’ he said looking at the clouds. Then he turned to me and said ‘You got a wife?’ That grin was as big as ever. Thankfully I had turned to look at the clouds and my face couldn’t betray me to him. It was like his gaze was boring into the side of my head. I could feel it pressing up against me, sure as he was standing there. I managed to croak out a no. Then he asked me one more time. He made me look at him in the eyes like I was under compulsion or something. He looked in my eyes and he said, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

That grin was still there, and I was waiting for it to twist, for him to leap on me and drop that post on my head. But it stayed steady and I felt like I forgot how to speak. I couldn’t tell if he was asking for my name or for me to give him one, or to tell him someone else’s name, but I didn’t like the thought of what might happen if I told him one. I felt like he knew my name just by looking at me. So I swallowed a lump in my throat, shook my head, and croaked out another no.

He held my gaze for a bit longer, and then he started laughing. Just chuckling at first, kind of a hearty sound, but then it escalated, and he was all over his register, high and low, cackling like a loon.

He picked up his T-post and slung it on his shoulder. I was scared he might swing it at me, so I took a few steps back. He didn’t move toward me, to my relief.

He turned towards the powerlines and jumped, like he had springs in his shoes, some thirty foot in the air, and that T-post became light as air. The wind started to pick up, and he almost floated down between the powerlines, some twenty foot in the air, and he caught one powerline on one side of the T-post and two lines on the other side. And it sparked something awful, and he just laughed louder. All the time, laughing. And those wires, they didn’t bend like normal wires. They stretched like rubberbands as his weight settled on them. Then, following the lines, they launched him up and over the nearest telephone pole onto the next stretch of wires, almost floating like gravity didn’t remember him, all the while cackling and hooting like it was the most fun he’d ever had.

I watched him swing off into the distance, dark suit against that darkening sky. After a minute, I lost sight of him, but that telephone line was still twanging like a guitar string. The wind picked up and the sky was turning green, and I felt this overwhelming sense of fear since I couldn’t see him anymore. Only other time I felt like that was not being able to see the enemy in the war. So I turned and started running. Left the tractor in the field. That storm chased me all the way home. And that twanging of the wires…It almost sounded like laughter.

I got home, my feet were bleeding in my boots, and Dorene thought I was sick or something from how pale I was. She asked why I’d left the tractor and I just said it broke down. I didn’t say anything about the man. Seemed like he might know if I told her. Weighed heavy on my mind. The one thing I never told her before she died.”

He stopped and sat for a while, just staring out the window at that turbulent sky.

“You know, your sister inherited your grandma’s looks, but I think you inherited your grandma’s spirit. Thank you for coming to visit me.”

“Of course, grandpa,” I said, a little confused.

“Want a piece of peach pie? I got a little ice cream in the freezer.” He seemed to shake himself out of the funk pretty quick. We had some pie, and I retired to the spare room upstairs.

The storm made it hard to sleep. I tossed and turned as rain battered the window and thunder boomed and shook the house. It sounded like a war outside.

The next morning, I had a drowsy cup of burnt coffee and an egg and bacon with my grandpa before I gave him a hug, climbed into my car, and shuttled off down the gravel road. Grandpa seemed back to his usual self as he waved goodbye from the front porch. But maybe the lines in his face hid the fatigue in his eyes.

As my car zoomed over sluggish gravel roads now wet from the rain, I thought about the story. I looked to the side of the road, half expecting to see evidence of a strange man dragging a metal T-post. Maybe some of the indents in the new mud were footprints.

I finished my road trip with all the normal and happy memories I had hoped for. This one, though, stuck out in the bunch of them. And I haven’t been able to forget it easily.

1ni2sof,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ni2sof/am_i_overreacting/,am I overreacting?,"This will be long I apologize. 
I (22F) have been dating my (31M) for six months. 
We have never really had any issues and overall everything is great. Our communication is really good, we have great chemistry and previously our sex life was really good. 

let me preface with I place a lot of importance on sex. I know it’s something that I need to work on but sex is really important to me. It’s not really about the act it’s more about feeling desired and wanted and just being close to that person.
I also have diagnosed BPD and tend to get overly emotional,overthink things,and I'm constantly over analysing reasons why I'm not enough. 

when we first started dating we would have sex every time, most the time multiple times while I was there. We also are only able to see each other every two weeks on the weekend due to his job. 

This past weekend I wanted to have sex and I kept initiating and it just felt like he was pushing me away which made me feel super insecure and embarrassed. It wasnt about sex it was about wanting to feel close to him and be desired by him. Well I brought it up a few times and we had a few different conversations about it. 

The first one was I got upset and I cried to him and told him that I missed him throughout the week a lot and that I wasn’t trying to make him feel guilty for saying that it's just hard. I worded it that way because I felt super angry towards myself for feeling upset when I should just be greatful to be around him and I should cherish the few weekends I get with him. After that I told him it also kind of hurt my feelings when he pushed me away when I tried to go down on him and he said he didn’t push me away and he apologized and said that he felt bad for seeming like that.
(I also wanted to add that after I told him about how I miss him he said that he misses me too, and he feels really guilty throughout the week for not being able to be with me) 

The next morning I was a little upset because we still hadn't had sex and I was just beating myself up. Between feeling guilty for feeling that way and feeling undesirable. I got up before him and when we woke up I asked him if he wanted to go to the bedroom (I brought my new puppy over and didn't want to do it in front of her) he asked why and I said because I wanted to have sex with him and he said to let him wake up a bit and then we can. 

Come mid day I asked him if there was anything I could do to be more appealing to him. He said no and asked me why I asked that. I explained to him how I was feeling and we talked about it. He said he wanted to have sex with me and he would later. And I communicated I also would like him to work on initiating more and he took accountability for that and said that he would work on that and he apologized. It was a good conversation and that was also the first time I asked him to work on something.

Well after that we watched a few movies and he got up to go get coffee and I pulled him in for a kiss and he gave me a peck and walked away. I sat there basically pouting for 30ish minute in my head and he noticed so I finally told him what was wrong. he also said that he felt like I looked at him like I was disgusted after I kissed him, and I said I didn’t it just kind of hurt my feelings that he pulled away. I apologized for being super emotional today and in my head. he apologized, and he said he felt bad for making me upset, and that the reason he pulled away was because he hadn’t brushed his teeth yet, and he didn’t mean to make me upset, then we hugged. 

a little while later, he asked me if I wanted to play cards and I said I want to have sex with you lol. And he said let's play cards first and then we can. Well, we drank the night before and he already had a pretty bad hangover and then he drank again and he got pretty sick. He was pretty nauseous.
he laid down on the couch and I went to go cuddle with him, and I kept asking him if there was anything that I could do for him or get him to make him feel better. he said no and then he said he should’ve listened to me and had sex before we played cards and that he felt bad he wouldn’t be able to and that made me feel so horrible and guilty. I joked with him that he stuck with me forever and we have plenty of time to have sex and I apologize for being super emotional today and in my head I told him that I’m just scared and I feel like I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop and he asked me what I meant and I told him that things have been going so well for so long and I’m just scared that he’s going to get tired of me and he said he thinks it’s the opposite that things just get better and better and they have been getting better and better and if anything, we’re just continue to get stronger. I held him and stroked his hair. 

overall I just feel really horrible that I was in my head the whole time we hung out and I didn’t cherish the moments that I had. 
I also just feel so insecure right now and undesirable.
I came on to him at least 10 plus times when I was over there. I came on to him before we were super drunk. I came on him before he was super sick so if he truly wanted to have sex with me, why not during those times? and I am nervous to see him or hang out with him again now because I’m scared that the next time we hang out it’s just gonna be the same thing we’re not gonna have sex and the next time after that and the next time after that. and it’s just gonna keep proving to me over and over and over there’s something wrong with me. or if we do have sex, which honestly how I’m feeling right now I highly doubt it will just be a pity fuck.

I also would like to clarify for the past two months our sex life has been a little off just due to life circumstances which I guess is causing me to feel this way as well.
Two months ago we went to go visit my family and we didn't have sex due to being so preoccupied. Then two weeks later we did and he didnt stay up the whole time which he said was due to alcohol but we've gotten drunk and had sex many times with no issues. And then there was this time.
Due to the two week gaps we have to go the time in between stacks up. 

I know I may be making a mountain out of a mole hill and I'm alo not upset at him just myself. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice and/or outside perspectives.

1ni2pth,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1ni2pth/dating_after_leaving_the_church/,Dating after leaving the church,"Good evening,

I just joined this group to get feedback on what dating is like after leaving the church community.

I am a 34-year old white male currently attending church. However, my heart is no longer in it. The turning point for me was way back in youth group when the youth pastor told me that marriage isn't everything in the weeks leading up to her wedding ceremony. Lo and behold, she moved to a different province and unfriended me shortly after.

Ever since then, it has become clear that I will not find the woman I desire at church. I am not one of those people who believes The One will just walk up to me during coffee break. I know the chances of hitting it off with a child-free woman are slim. Furthermore, I can no longer be the single guy who's put on volunteer teams so that families and couples can ""worship"" on Sunday morning.

All of that having been said, what is dating like once you abandon your faith?",3,1757981820.0,exchristian,2,1.0,False
1ni2pd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ni2pd5/my_grandpa_met_a_strange_man/,My Grandpa Met a Strange Man,"The wind was full of humidity as I tore down the Indiana gravel road in my 2003 Chevy Impala. In my rear view mirror, thunderclouds gathered like artillery ready for battle, and the first flashes of lightning hit the ground at regular intervals. The cornfields rippled like waves. The sky’s greenish hue made the world feel alien, and the dust cloud behind me made it seem like the ground itself was trying to escape the storm.

I turned onto a small dirt driveway and parked in front of a white two story farmhouse. Shielding my eyes, I grabbed my duffle bag from the front seat and bounded up the three stairs, closing the whipping screen door behind me.

My grandpa was seated in his chair in the living room watching Hogan’s Heroes. His dinner plate sat next to him, remnants of tater tot casserole speckling it.

He adjusted his ninety-two-year-old frame to turn and see me, then stood at a snail’s pace to offer a greeting. “Alice, how are you, my girl?”

“I’m doing good, grandpa, how are you?”

“Oh, just dandy. You got so tall,” he said, hunched shoulders raising to their limits to give me a hug. Thick arthritic fingers patted my back, hands now more like claws than hands. My grandpa had been a farmer all his life. When none of his kids wanted to take the farm over, he just kept working, selling off land piece by piece to pay for his meager living. Even now, he still kept a garden with cabbage, peppers, onions, rhubarb, and a few tomato plants. Three chickens gave him an egg for every morning’s breakfast, and a neighbor brought him milk every week. He was a simple man.

“How’s school going for ya?” His voice was gruff, yet joyful.

“I’m all graduated now.”

“Really!”

“Yep, got a job and everything.”

“That’s wonderful. Where at?”

“It’s in Washington State. That’s where I’m headed now if you can believe it.”

“Really? That’s a long drive.”

“Well that’s why I’m staying with you. Break it up a little bit. I’m visiting national parks and staying with friends too.”

“Oh wow. That sounds super. Well, if you need anything to eat, I’ve got tater tot casserole on the stove.”

I helped myself to a plate and sat on a lightly dusted sofa across from my grandpa. I told him all about school, and he told me about life in town. The bakery he went to every morning for the same burnt coffee had changed ownership, and now the rolls he brought home for Saturday lunch were sourdough, which he liked. His coffee group was now significantly smaller, as at least three of them had died and two had moved into assisted living. It was a whirlwind of names I didn’t know, yet somehow my grandpa recounting their life stories made it feel like they were old friends of mine too.

Conversation grew sparse after an hour, and grandpa was getting tired. The wind outside the house eventually triumphed over the TV as the primary background noise. The storm clouds churned as the front got closer to the house. As the wind gusted, it swayed and bounced the old power lines running to the house and barn. It made a strange, twanging sound, reverberating in the turbulent air.

My grandpa perked up at the sound. The lines in his face shifted as he turned to the window enough to see the trees whipping around them.

“He’s on the lines.” His usual content tone melted away.

“What was that grandpa?”

He turned to me with a tired face that looked older than ever. With a thoughtful ponderance I had never associated with him when I was a child, he told me the strangest story I’ve ever heard.

“When I got back from the war, I bought this house, and your grandmother and I had our own little slice of paradise, it felt like, before kids came along. Not that that wasn’t paradise, too. Just a little noisier.

Well with my pension I had a mind to buy me a tractor and so I did. It was a beauty of a thing, Minneapolis Moline, white with yellow stripes, 37 horsepower. Got it second hand, but it served me real well. Our neighbor Frank had an older one that went caput, and he just used it for parts. Said I could use anything from it if I needed.

I was out in the field planting in May when a hose on the back broke. I knew Frank had the part and I was fairly close to his farm, so I decided to walk on up the gravel road to get there. Did you come from town or from the highway?”

“Town,” I said.

“Ok, if you came from the highway you’d have passed it. I was making my way back to the tractor with the hose when I walked up over a slight hill and saw a man walking toward me on the gravel road.

He sure was peculiar looking. Even though the summer heat had just started, he was wearing a black suit and a bow-tie. His shoes were covered in dust, but I could tell they had been shined recently. At first, I thought he mighta been some traveling preacher or something, but he didn’t carry no Bible nor a suitcase. Instead, he was dragging this steel T-post of sorts. It was like two sections of four inch pipe, one welded to the middle of the other one. I thought it mighta been a tractor component of some sort, though I’ve never seen anything like it.

When I finally got close enough to say good afternoon, I could see he had this greasy jet-black hair, done up with pomade so not one strand was out of place. When I called out to him, he gave me a smile with teeth as white as a sheet, and his eyes were something deep brown. In the afternoon sun, his face didn’t have no sweat on it. Real strange. He called back to me in a sort of sing-songy way.

‘Good afternoon, mister.’ He sounded like he had a voice for a pulpit, full, but not too deep and booming.

‘What are you up to, sir?’ I said back. We were now a few paces away. The sound of gravel grating against that pipe had stopped by that point, which I was glad for.

He said, ‘I’m just a-walkin the road, mister. Looking for something or someone.’

‘Whatcha looking for?’ I said. ‘You lost?’

‘No, no, not lost,’ he said ‘Just wandering. Wondering while I wander.’

So I asked ‘You a preacher?’ He kept smiling at me, so I figured maybe he had some holy disposition. But he shook his head and said ‘No, not by profession, but perhaps related to it.’

Now he was looking over at the power lines. They were running along hundred foot between posts, set horizontal across the top bar, and there was the landline too. So I asked him ‘You a lineman?’

‘No,’ he said, still grinning.

I kinda half laughed at the thought of a strangely dressed fellow wandering around not knowing what he was looking for. ‘Then whatcha doing out here?’ I asked him.

He turned to me and raised an eyebrow. ‘I’m looking for a name.’

Something in his tone made me tense up a little bit, so I just asked him ‘Like looking for somebody? Wanting to know who lives around here?’

But he just went on like he didn’t know what I was saying. ‘Oh, perhaps,’ he said. ‘I’m just in need of a name.’

And with that, he hoisted up that T-post and planted it in the loose gravel at his feet. Somehow it stayed upright. The top bar sat a little above our heads, and in a quick step he jumped up so he was hanging on it, back to the post, arms wrapped around each side of the top bar. He crossed his legs and hung there, grinning at me. That trick was strange. Something about him looking down at me didn’t feel right.

So I asked him ‘Where’d you learn a trick like that?’ He hopped down, but that T-post stayed put.

‘When you have time to wait, you have time to balance.’ He gave a little half bow and looked at me like I was supposed to clap or something. Then he asked me, ‘You been in the army, mister?’

I said I had, and he asked me where. I told him about the Pacific and his eyes sorta lit up at every detail I was giving him. After a bit, I got feeling so strange I just stopped in the middle of a sentence. He kept looking at me, then he asked ‘Did you find your service worthwhile?’

Seemed like kind of a strange question, but I said ‘Well I say it’s what I had to do.’

He started parroting me, going ‘Mmm, yes, what I had to do.’

So I asked ‘You ever been in the service?’

He perked up again. Wouldn’t give me a straight answer. ‘In a sort of way, yes. The service has treated me mighty fine.’ He knocked on the T-post, caught it as it started to tip over, and then set it back up. Then he kept talking, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

His smile was making me uncomfortable. I watched him pull himself up to the top of the T-post and sit there on the middle of it. I was waiting for him to tip over, but then he hoisted himself up to his feet, and by Jove, he was walking along the top beam like some kinda tight rope. So I said, ‘You from the circus?’

He looked at me, standing on that beam, smiling like a loon, and said, ‘You might call it a bit of a circus. Maybe as chaotic as one.’ He jumped down and landed like a cat.

The wind started to pick up, and he almost floated down between the powerlines, some twenty foot in the air, and he caught one powerline on one side of the T-post and two lines on the other side. And it sparked something awful, and he just laughed louder. All the time, laughing. And those wires, they didn’t bend like normal wires. They stretched like rubberbands as his weight settled on them. Then, following the lines, they launched him up and over the nearest telephone pole onto the next stretch of wires, almost floating like gravity didn’t remember him, all the while cackling and hooting like it was the most fun he’d ever had.

I turned onto a small dirt driveway and parked in front of a white two story farmhouse. Shielding my eyes, I grabbed my duffle bag from the front seat and bounded up the three stairs, closing the whipping screen door behind me.

My grandpa was seated in his chair in the living room watching Hogan’s Heroes. His dinner plate sat next to him, remnants of tater tot casserole speckling it.

He adjusted his ninety-two-year-old frame to turn and see me, then stood at a snail’s pace to offer a greeting. “Alice, how are you, my girl?”

“I’m doing good, grandpa, how are you?”

“Oh, just dandy. You got so tall,” he said, hunched shoulders raising to their limits to give me a hug. Thick arthritic fingers patted my back, hands now more like claws than hands. My grandpa had been a farmer all his life. When none of his kids wanted to take the farm over, he just kept working, selling off land piece by piece to pay for his meager living. Even now, he still kept a garden with cabbage, peppers, onions, rhubarb, and a few tomato plants. Three chickens gave him an egg for every morning’s breakfast, and a neighbor brought him milk every week. He was a simple man.

“How’s school going for ya?” His voice was gruff, yet joyful.

“I’m all graduated now.”

“Really!”

“Yep, got a job and everything.”

“That’s wonderful. Where at?”

“It’s in Washington State. That’s where I’m headed now if you can believe it.”

“Really? That’s a long drive.”

“Well that’s why I’m staying with you. Break it up a little bit. I’m visiting national parks and staying with friends too.”

“Oh wow. That sounds super. Well, if you need anything to eat, I’ve got tater tot casserole on the stove.”

I helped myself to a plate and sat on a lightly dusted sofa across from my grandpa. I told him all about school, and he told me about life in town. The bakery he went to every morning for the same burnt coffee had changed ownership, and now the rolls he brought home for Saturday lunch were sourdough, which he liked. His coffee group was now significantly smaller, as at least three of them had died and two had moved into assisted living. It was a whirlwind of names I didn’t know, yet somehow my grandpa recounting their life stories made it feel like they were old friends of mine too.

Conversation grew sparse after an hour, and grandpa was getting tired. The wind outside the house eventually triumphed over the TV as the primary background noise. The storm clouds churned as the front got closer to the house. As the wind gusted, it swayed and bounced the old power lines running to the house and barn. It made a strange, twanging sound, reverberating in the turbulent air.

My grandpa perked up at the sound. The lines in his face shifted as he turned to the window enough to see the trees whipping around them.

“He’s on the lines.” His usual content tone melted away.

“What was that grandpa?”

He turned to me with a tired face that looked older than ever. With a thoughtful ponderance I had never associated with him when I was a child, he told me the strangest story I’ve ever heard.

“When I got back from the war, I bought this house, and your grandmother and I had our own little slice of paradise, it felt like, before kids came along. Not that that wasn’t paradise, too. Just a little noisier.

Well with my pension I had a mind to buy me a tractor and so I did. It was a beauty of a thing, Minneapolis Moline, white with yellow stripes, 37 horsepower. Got it second hand, but it served me real well. Our neighbor Frank had an older one that went caput, and he just used it for parts. Said I could use anything from it if I needed.

I was out in the field planting in May when a hose on the back broke. I knew Frank had the part and I was fairly close to his farm, so I decided to walk on up the gravel road to get there. Did you come from town or from the highway?”

“Town,” I said.

“Ok, if you came from the highway you’d have passed it. I was making my way back to the tractor with the hose when I walked up over a slight hill and saw a man walking toward me on the gravel road.

He sure was peculiar looking. Even though the summer heat had just started, he was wearing a black suit and a bow-tie. His shoes were covered in dust, but I could tell they had been shined recently. At first, I thought he mighta been some traveling preacher or something, but he didn’t carry no Bible nor a suitcase. Instead, he was dragging this steel T-post of sorts. It was like two sections of four inch pipe, one welded to the middle of the other one. I thought it mighta been a tractor component of some sort, though I’ve never seen anything like it.

When I finally got close enough to say good afternoon, I could see he had this greasy jet-black hair, done up with pomade so not one strand was out of place. When I called out to him, he gave me a smile with teeth as white as a sheet, and his eyes were something deep brown. In the afternoon sun, his face didn’t have no sweat on it. Real strange. He called back to me in a sort of sing-songy way.

‘Good afternoon, mister.’ He sounded like he had a voice for a pulpit, full, but not too deep and booming.

‘What are you up to, sir?’ I said back. We were now a few paces away. The sound of gravel grating against that pipe had stopped by that point, which I was glad for.

He said, ‘I’m just a-walkin the road, mister. Looking for something or someone.’

‘Whatcha looking for?’ I said. ‘You lost?’

‘No, no, not lost,’ he said ‘Just wandering. Wondering while I wander.’

So I asked ‘You a preacher?’ He kept smiling at me, so I figured maybe he had some holy disposition. But he shook his head and said ‘No, not by profession, but perhaps related to it.’

Now he was looking over at the power lines. They were running along hundred foot between posts, set horizontal across the top bar, and there was the landline too. So I asked him ‘You a lineman?’

‘No,’ he said, still grinning.

I kinda half laughed at the thought of a strangely dressed fellow wandering around not knowing what he was looking for. ‘Then whatcha doing out here?’ I asked him.

He turned to me and raised an eyebrow. ‘I’m looking for a name.’

Something in his tone made me tense up a little bit, so I just asked him ‘Like looking for somebody? Wanting to know who lives around here?’

But he just went on like he didn’t know what I was saying. ‘Oh, perhaps,’ he said. ‘I’m just in need of a name.’

And with that, he hoisted up that T-post and planted it in the loose gravel at his feet. Somehow it stayed upright. The top bar sat a little above our heads, and in a quick step he jumped up so he was hanging on it, back to the post, arms wrapped around each side of the top bar. He crossed his legs and hung there, grinning at me. That trick was strange. Something about him looking down at me didn’t feel right.

So I asked him ‘Where’d you learn a trick like that?’ He hopped down, but that T-post stayed put.

‘When you have time to wait, you have time to balance.’ He gave a little half bow and looked at me like I was supposed to clap or something. Then he asked me, ‘You been in the army, mister?’

I said I had, and he asked me where. I told him about the Pacific and his eyes sorta lit up at every detail I was giving him. After a bit, I got feeling so strange I just stopped in the middle of a sentence. He kept looking at me, then he asked ‘Did you find your service worthwhile?’

Seemed like kind of a strange question, but I said ‘Well I say it’s what I had to do.’

He started parroting me, going ‘Mmm, yes, what I had to do.’

So I asked ‘You ever been in the service?’

He perked up again. Wouldn’t give me a straight answer. ‘In a sort of way, yes. The service has treated me mighty fine.’ He knocked on the T-post, caught it as it started to tip over, and then set it back up. Then he kept talking, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

His smile was making me uncomfortable. I watched him pull himself up to the top of the T-post and sit there on the middle of it. I was waiting for him to tip over, but then he hoisted himself up to his feet, and by Jove, he was walking along the top beam like some kinda tight rope. So I said, ‘You from the circus?’

He looked at me, standing on that beam, smiling like a loon, and said, ‘You might call it a bit of a circus. Maybe as chaotic as one.’ He jumped down and landed like a cat.

It was then that I realized how late in the day it was getting, and that the sun had been swallowed up by some clouds on the western horizon. They were big ol’ storm clouds, and it sure looked like rain. So I said that it looks like rain and that I might be needing to go. His eyebrows shot up at that, and I got scared he might follow me. Didn’t know how I’d get away, considering the tractor was busted and it was almost a straight shot back to the house. I didn’t want to try and outrun him neither. So I just figured I’d keep talking until he decided to leave. ‘You afraid of getting caught in the storm?’ I said.

‘No, I love a good storm,’ he said looking at the clouds. Then he turned to me and said ‘You got a wife?’ That grin was as big as ever. Thankfully I had turned to look at the clouds and my face couldn’t betray me to him. It was like his gaze was boring into the side of my head. I could feel it pressing up against me, sure as he was standing there. I managed to croak out a no. Then he asked me one more time. He made me look at him in the eyes like I was under compulsion or something. He looked in my eyes and he said, ‘I’m looking for a name. You got one for me?’

That grin was still there, and I was waiting for it to twist, for him to leap on me and drop that post on my head. But it stayed steady and I felt like I forgot how to speak. I couldn’t tell if he was asking for my name or for me to give him one, or to tell him someone else’s name, but I didn’t like the thought of what might happen if I told him one. I felt like he knew my name just by looking at me. So I swallowed a lump in my throat, shook my head, and croaked out another no.

He held my gaze for a bit longer, and then he started laughing. Just chuckling at first, kind of a hearty sound, but then it escalated, and he was all over his register, high and low, cackling like a loon.

He picked up his T-post and slung it on his shoulder. I was scared he might swing it at me, so I took a few steps back. He didn’t move toward me, to my relief.

He turned towards the powerlines and jumped, like he had springs in his shoes, some thirty foot in the air, and that T-post became light as air. The wind started to pick up, and he almost floated down between the powerlines, some twenty foot in the air, and he caught one powerline on one side of the T-post and two lines on the other side. And it sparked something awful, and he just laughed louder. All the time, laughing. And those wires, they didn’t bend like normal wires. They stretched like rubberbands as his weight settled on them. Then, following the lines, they launched him up and over the nearest telephone pole onto the next stretch of wires, almost floating like gravity didn’t remember him, all the while cackling and hooting like it was the most fun he’d ever had.

I watched him swing off into the distance, dark suit against that darkening sky. After a minute, I lost sight of him, but that telephone line was still twanging like a guitar string. The wind picked up and the sky was turning green, and I felt this overwhelming sense of fear since I couldn’t see him anymore. Only other time I felt like that was not being able to see the enemy in the war. So I turned and started running. Left the tractor in the field. That storm chased me all the way home. And that twanging of the wires…It almost sounded like laughter.

I got home, my feet were bleeding in my boots, and Dorene thought I was sick or something from how pale I was. She asked why I’d left the tractor and I just said it broke down. I didn’t say anything about the man. Seemed like he might know if I told her. Weighed heavy on my mind. The one thing I never told her before she died.”

He stopped and sat for a while, just staring out the window at that turbulent sky.

“You know, your sister inherited your grandma’s looks, but I think you inherited your grandma’s spirit. Thank you for coming to visit me.”

“Of course, grandpa,” I said, a little confused.

“Want a piece of peach pie? I got a little ice cream in the freezer.” He seemed to shake himself out of the funk pretty quick. We had some pie, and I retired to the spare room upstairs.

The storm made it hard to sleep. I tossed and turned as rain battered the window and thunder boomed and shook the house. It sounded like a war outside.

The next morning, I had a drowsy cup of burnt coffee and an egg and bacon with my grandpa before I gave him a hug, climbed into my car, and shuttled off down the gravel road. Grandpa seemed back to his usual self as he waved goodbye from the front porch. But maybe the lines in his face hid the fatigue in his eyes.

As my car zoomed over sluggish gravel roads now wet from the rain, I thought about the story. I looked to the side of the road, half expecting to see evidence of a strange man dragging a metal T-post. Maybe some of the indents in the new mud were footprints.

I finished my road trip with all the normal and happy memories I had hoped for. This one, though, stuck out in the bunch of them. And I haven’t been able to forget it easily.

Yesterday, I got a phone call that my grandpa passed. He was sitting in his chair in the living room. We had a big storm come through in Washington last night, and it made me feel like I should share this with somebody.",7,1757981722.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1ni2n53,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/1ni2n53/why_all_the_hate_for_vallejo/,Why All the Hate for Vallejo?,"I'm a fairly new member of this sub and it seems like when someone asks about where to live, people will pile on Vallejo as if it's a crime-infested dump. 

We moved here five years ago because our Peninsula landlord had hiked up our rent by $1K/month. We wanted to rent a house and the only place we could afford was Vallejo. Our rental house was in Glen Cove and cost less than the Peninsula house before the price hike. We liked living here so much, we decided to take advantage of the low interest rates and buy a house, something we couldn't have done anywhere else in the Bay Area. It's a nice house in a nice neighborhood with a lovely view.

Yes, Vallejo has some serious issues, but not more than many other cities in the Bay Area. For example, the nice Peninsula city we moved from had a serious crime issue along the 280 corridor and the local suburban shopping center has issues with bipping. 

Vallejo has nice neighborhoods with lovely tree-lined streets. Lots of Victorian, Edwardian, and Craftsman houses. I just checked and the median house price is $525K. 

I'll admit the schools aren't great and shopping is mid. The bridge tolls are a real buzz kill. Sideshows are a very annoying and dangerous problem.

The biggest plus for me is the strong sense of community, one that I've never felt anywhere else I've ever lived. We all know where we live and we know certain people will look down on us for living here, i.e., the bridge and tunnel snobs. Whatever. Anyone who's spent Friday night at the art walk, Saturday morning at the farmers market and Moschetti's coffee roasting warehouse, walked the Mare Island and Glen Cove trails,  and watched the Mad Hatter parade will know what I mean.

1ni2mf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ni2mf0/my_familys_belief_in_mormonism_will_die_with_my/,My Family's belief in Mormonism will die with my Generation.,"My parents are both converts. My father's parents also converted but my dad was an adult and his sister didn't join. It started because I had two uncles who died during childhood and after each one the missionaries came knocking. They eventually convinced my dad and grandparents to join their reunion so they could all be together in the afterlife. 

My mom had a tough life as a child and young adult and she felt that tscc helped her through it. She has a lot of siblings none of which have anything to do with tscc.

I have 3 siblings. Only one of us is active. That one sibling married a women who can't and doesn't want children. Me and my other two siblings left. Me and my siblings never went on missions even though my Dad did in his late 20s. You wouldn't commonly run into Mormons where we live in Canada. I think about 0.2% of people are Mormon. This means our family's involvement in this church should die with us.

My parents are wonderful people. I do feel like a lot of the good things I learned from my parents are not necessarily because of Mormonism. It's hard to separate how people would be without this religion in their life.

My parents are now service missionaries and I'm upset they are being exploited for free labour when they could be enjoying their retirement.

I left due to the struggles my now ex-wife went through. I was had to come to terms with a lot of the issues with tscc I had buried deep down and ask if I wanted to keep attending. It's been 8 or 9 years but I sometimes miss the community tscc gave me. I'm trying my best to build my own community even though I now live in a rural area away from my family.

I'm happy that I don't have to wear silly underwear and forgo coffee and tea which is something people here always struggled to understand. I don't have to waste 10% of my money anymore. People complain about taxes, but I'd rather the government have it than a church that hoards wealth.

I also felt closer to my extended family and could finally have a cup of coffee or a drink with some of them.

I am kind of curious how many people out there have a similar story where you didn't convert but don't have long family roots in tscc. Are other family members still active?",23,1757981562.0,exmormon,3,1.0,False

Hey there, I’m a 33 year old guy from Southeast Michigan. I’d like to meet a woman who’s also looking for something genuine, friendship first with the possibility of it naturally turning into more if the vibe is right.

A little about me: I’m 5’10”, athletic build, brown hair, green eyes, and I’ve been told I have a laid back but fun personality. I love the outdoors, camping, hiking, or just sitting by a fire, but I’m equally happy with a good book, a great show, or sharing coffee and conversation. Sarcasm, laughter, and physical affection go a long way with me.

I’m not into games or drama, just hoping to connect with someone who’s kind, fun, and knows what she wants. Whether it stays as a solid friendship or grows into something more, I’m open to seeing where things go.

\
Current Bahrain Business Environment (2025)\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain Bay., Bahrain’s GDP is projected to grow 4.2% in 2025, building on a surge of FDI led by tech and financial services. The Diplomatic Area and Bahrain Bay have become magnets for international businesses. New regional agreements have boosted 100% foreign ownership opportunities in key sectors (see Keylink: Foreigner-Friendly Activities), and the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) bahrain.com has made fast-track company formation an anchor of their global pitch.\
\
Importantly, a May 2025 Forbes Business survey named Bahrain the Gulf’s “best-kept secret for entrepreneurs” due to streamlined processes and “genuine openness to non-GCC investors.”\
\
The government’s Sijilat platform and Tamkeen’s aggressive 2025 SME support continue to simplify the process. Bahrain’s free zones and low-tax regime keep the cost of entry lower than regional peers (free zones info).\
Bank Account Approval: How Long Does It Actually Take?\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation in office workflow..\
\
\
For free zone companies (in Bahrain International Investment Park or Bahrain Logistics Zone):\
Average time is 10–18 working days, with extra due diligence on activities and ownership.\
\
\
For companies with UBOs (ultimate beneficial owners) from high-risk jurisdictions:\
  Approval can take up to 1–2 months due to enhanced KYC and CDD processes.\
\
\
Why the Range?\
Banks’ compliance departments want clarity and zero ambiguity—especially since the November 2024 CBB (Central Bank of Bahrain) directive on AML risk assessment tightened onboarding (see Compliance section below).\
A single missing document? Your file drops to the bottom of the pile.\
Pro tip:\
You can cut actual “bank visit” time to under an hour by booking early-morning appointments at less-crowded Seef or Diplomatic Area branches. (When I used Seef’s BBK branch at 8:01 am, I was out with paperwork in 42 minutes.)\
See the full Bahrain company formation process here.\
Expert Steps: How to Speed Up Your Bank Account Approval\
\
Alt text: Business meeting and professional planning in Diplomatic Area office.:*\
- Company CR (Commercial Registration) from Sijilat\
- MOICT-stamped Memorandum or Articles of Association\
- Board Resolution approving bank account opening\
- Shareholder passports (originals + clear color copies)\
- Recent utility bill (proof of Bahrain address)\
- Lease agreement for your Bahrain office\
- LMRA approval for any staff (if already obtained)\
- Business plan with cashflow projection (especially for sectors like fintech or consultancy)\
- Source of funds statement\
Time-saving tip:\
Scan and email all docs as a single, password-protected PDF to your bank contact two days prior to your meeting. (Trust me, this single habit has sliced a week off many of my clients’ approvals.)\
Step 2: Choose the Best Bank and Branch\
\
Popular banks for company formation:\
  Ahli United Bank, BBK, Bank ABC, GIB, Al Salam Bank\
Best branches to avoid queues:\
Seef District (early morning, best parking)\
Diplomatic Area (right after lunch, post-majlis)\
Bahrain Bay (quietest, but staff sometimes rotate)\
\
Budgeting for time:\
- Arriving first thing (8–8:15 am) means you skip the “majlis crowd.”\
- Avoid Thursdays—queue chaos as expats rush before the weekend.\
Step 3: Leverage Sijilat & Tamkeen Integration\
\
Sijilat now integrates directly with most bank onboarding platforms (since March 2025).\
After CR issuance, banks can verify your company file online.\
If you use a Tamkeen-supported business package, banks often prioritize your file (I’ve seen this cut one week off processing at Bank ABC).\
\
Step 4: Prepare for the Interview\
\
Expect a short KYC call or in-person interview.\
You’ll be asked about business activity, client types, and expected turnover.\
Pro tip: Have your business plan summary on hand, and rehearse a simple “source of funds” answer that matches your submitted paperwork.\
\
Step 5: Follow Up, Politely But Persistently\
\
Contact your bank relationship manager every 48 hours after submission.\
Use WhatsApp (common in Bahrain corporate culture).\
And—always accept coffee. Relationship building matters here.\
\
My personal mistake?\
Early on, I underestimated the follow-up. My file sat idle for four days until a friendly WhatsApp message from the office manager jumpstarted things. (Don’t be shy, local persistence is respected.)\
For more on optimal company formation strategies, see Keylink’s Bahrain company formation guide.\
Company Types & Structures: What Banks Expect\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain meeting.:\
  Fastest approval, especially if all shareholders are local or GCC nationals.\
- Single Person Company (SPC):\
  Also quick—just ensure MOICT registration is flawless.\
- Foreign-owned companies:**\
  Banks will scrutinize UBO (Ultimate Beneficial Owner) structure and cross-check with 99% foreign ownership rules.\
\
Branch of Foreign Company:\
  Needs parent company board resolution, parent’s articles, and additional legalizations.\
Free zone entity:\
  Must show lease, special activity approval from EDB, plus possibly extra compliance for logistics/warehousing.\
\
Traditional sectors (trading, construction, consultancies) pass quicker. Regulated sectors (finance, crypto, legal, healthcare) face extended due diligence.\
You can explore more about entity types at Keylink: Business Type Structures.\
Costs, Fees, and Budgeting: Real BHD Figures\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for business formation in Bahrain..\
- Minimum deposit:\
  Most banks require BHD 1,000–5,000 deposited upon opening.\
  - High-risk or regulated activities may face higher minimums (up to BHD 10,000).\
- Annual account maintenance fees:\
  Range from BHD 100–300 per year for standard business accounts.\
Local tip: Some banks (Al Salam, Ahli United) waive opening fees for Tamkeen-supported startups or if you maintain a balance above BHD 10,000.\
\
Consultancy and document attestation fees:\
  If you use a formation agent, budget BHD 200–500 for bank packs and document legalization.\
\
For a complete analysis of company formation costs, see Keylink: Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
Surprisingly, cash flow management in the first three months is often hampered when overseas shareholders underestimate the initial deposit and maintenance charges—make your BHD budget stretch further by confirming all fees before signing anything.\
Compliance, Documentation, and Regulatory Updates (2025)\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: contract signing in Bahrain., Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) declarations, and Source of Funds documentation.\
\
Enhanced Due Diligence:\
Required for companies with complex structures, offshore links, or shareholders from sanctioned destinations.\
\
Expect requests for supporting contracts, invoices, and tax returns.\
\
\
2025 Regulatory Updates:\
\
All banks now digitally cross-reference Sijilat and MOICT records for real-time CR and director verification.\
LMRA-registered employers must present up-to-date employee lists.\
\
Don’t forget:\
- If your office lease is shared (common in Bahrain Bay or Diplomatic Area), ensure you have direct utility bills—banks may reject subleases without clear proof.\
Common challenge:\
In my first year, a client’s account got stuck over an “inactive” LMRA registration. Quick call to LMRA hotline and uploading an up-to-date Tamkeen grant certificate solved it in 48 hours. (Always check official records before booking your bank appointment.)\
For ongoing compliance, professional bookkeeping is invaluable—see Keylink: Accounting and Bookkeeping Services.\
Professional Support: Should You Use a Consultant?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation in Bahrain..\
  - Provide on-site Arabic-speaking support to deal with nuances at MOICT, LMRA, or bank counters.\
\
Recommended resources:\
Keylink Bahrain’s formation services\
Local law firms with strong Sijilat/MOICT expertise for regulated sectors\

Without a consultant, you may spend twice as long chasing signatures, translations, and government stamps.\
And government buildings (like the Sijilat main counter in Seef) close at 1:30 pm sharp—timing is everything.\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi: Why Is It Faster Here?\
Ownership flexibility, personal relationships, and less red tape—Bahrain scores higher than the UAE and KSA for streamlined banking, according to Gulf News.\
- UAE banks usually take 30–45 days for new foreign-owned accounts (with mandatory in-person board interviews).\
- Saudi banks often require in-KSA board presence and Arabic-only documents, adding weeks.\
Bahrain’s banks are more progressive due to real-time digital government integration and a smaller expat business community where relationship-building is faster and friendlier.\
But, don’t expect everything overnight. Even with speed, the importance of proper documentation and personal follow-up shouldn’t be underestimated.\
An Unexpected Lesson: Coffee, Majlis, and Timing\
A curious tangent—on my second-ever account opening, a branch manager in Bahrain Bay explained that Thursdays are always slow “because majlis runs long, and everyone wants coffee before signing.”\
Majlis-style meetings (informal gatherings often with traditional Arabic coffee) remain common in Bahrain’s business culture, even in the most modern settings.\
Timing tip:\
- Schedule bank appointments for early in the week (Sunday or Monday) and avoid late mornings when offices serve coffee and the decision-makers mingle.\
Mastering these subtle customs—accepting the coffee, embracing the small talk, and understanding Ramadan hour adjustments—can, weirdly, speed up your file’s progress.\
Top Mistakes to Avoid When Opening a Bahrain Bank Account\
\
Submitting incomplete documents, especially missing director or shareholder info.\
Using a sublease or virtual office without utility bills in your company’s name.\
Failing to declare UBOs or provide proper source of funds evidence.\
Booking appointments too late in the day—files rarely get processed after 1:00 pm.\
Ignoring WhatsApp follow-ups with your bank relationship manager.\
Not understanding the importance of relationship-building (accept all coffee offers!).\
\
Prevention strategy:\
Have a pre-appointment checklist, assign one person to handle all government portal logins, and always run your documents past a local expert.\

[Vesuvio’s. Evening. The restaurant is warm, candlelit, full of quiet chatter. Tony, Silvio, and Christopher sit at their usual table near the back. Artie Bucco hovers proudly, holding a steaming plate.]

Artie:
[with flourish]
“Gentlemen, tonight you’re in for a treat. We got a braised osso buco—veal shank, cooked low and slow for eight hours in a white wine reduction with a little lemon zest. Served over saffron risotto, just the way Nonna used to make. And for the side, roasted peppers with garlic and olive oil, straight from Calabria.”

[He sets the plates down, beaming like a kid showing off a school project. Tony leans back, inhaling the aroma, eyes half-closed in appreciation.]

Tony:
“Mmm. Artie, you’re the only guy I know who could talk about food like he’s reading the fucking Bible. Sit down already, take a breath.”

Artie:
[wiping his hands on his apron, chuckling nervously]
“Hey, what can I say? Food is life, Tone. You gotta respect the ingredients.”

Chris:
[fork in hand, already digging in]
“Respect the ingredients, respect the chef. Got it. But more importantly—this is pretty fuckin’ good.”

Tony:
[smilling while eating]
""Now this– is what I mean by appreciation of fresh produce!""

Silvio:
[ever the diplomat, nodding politely]
“Exquisite, Artie. Really. You outdid yourself.”

[Artie beams, then finally drifts off to tend to another table. The three men eat in relative quiet for a moment, savoring the meal. Tony eventually breaks it.]

Tony:
“So… Saul Goodman.”

[Chris groans, mouth half-full of risotto.]

Chris:
“Ok, here we go…”

Silvio:
[leans in slightly, lowering his voice]
“Guy’s still on your mind, Tone?”

Tony:
“On my mind? He’s like fuckin’ parsley on every plate. Won’t go away. But I’ll admit—he got the job done. Twice.”

[Chris shrugs, cutting into his veal.]

Chris:
“Then maybe he’s worth the headaches. Better than half the mooks we got dealing with city hall.”

Tony:
[grimly]
“Maybe. But a guy like that… colorful, flashy. Sooner or later, that attracts attention. And attention? That’s poison.”

[Silvio nods slowly, chewing thoughtfully. Chris stays quiet this time. The camera lingers on Tony, his face half-lit by candlelight, as he ponders whether Saul is an asset… or a liability.]

...

[Meanwhile in Albuquerque, street at night. A garish neon billboard glows: “Saul Goodman: Attorney at Law — You Betta Call Saul!” The camera pans down to his office, where the inflatable Statue of Liberty flaps in the wind.]

[Inside Saul’s office. The place is buzzing. Francesca is on the phone with three lines blinking at once. Saul is pacing in front of a camera crew he clearly hired on the cheap.]

Director:
“Uh, Mr. Goodman, you ready for another take?”

Saul:
“Am I ready? Please. I was born ready. This face doesn’t just sell legal defense—it sells peace of mind!” [He finger-guns the camera, then turns back, muttering.] “Okay, peace of mind and maybe a little miracle or two.”

[He clears his throat, then launches into his over-the-top performance.]

Saul (to camera):
“Are you being shaken down by the city? Is zoning law making your life hell? Did some pencil-pusher at City Hall decide your property is suddenly theirs? Don’t sweat it! I’ll fight for your right to keep what’s yours. Criminal defense, civil disputes, parking tickets, DUIs—hell, if your neighbor’s cat looks at you funny, I’ll sue the furball! I’m Saul Goodman, and when the world’s out to get ya—”

[He leans closer to the camera, cheesy grin plastered on his face.]

Saul:
“You better call Saul!”

[The camera cuts. Francesca hangs up one phone line, picks up another, and groans.]

Francesca:
“Saul, you’ve got five new clients on hold, and three of ‘em are nuts.”

Saul:
“Francesca, sweetheart, they’re all nuts. Nuts with money.” [he rubs his hands together gleefully] “Which makes me nuttier than a payday bar, but hey—that’s showbiz, baby.”

[As he laughs, the camera cuts back to Tony’s world—him brooding quietly at the Bing, smoke curling around his face, a stark contrast to Saul’s circus.]

[Tony sits at a back table, cigar smoldering in the ashtray, drink in hand. The rest of the crew—Silvio, Paulie, Chris, Pussy—are scattered around him. There’s a lull in the chatter. Pussy finally breaks the silence.]

Pussy:
“Aye Tone, you alright?”

[Tony exhales through his nose, staring into his glass. He speaks slow, deliberate.]

Tony:
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just… thinkin’. About our friend Saul.”

[Paulie snorts, waving dismissively.]

Paulie:
“Guy’s a fuckin’ clown, Tone. Funny suit, funny commercials. But he gets shit done. End of story.”

Chris:
“Paulie’s right, T. He came through twice now. Yeah, he’s a circus act, but maybe that’s the point—he distracts people. They look at him, they don’t look at us.”

Silvio:
[leans in, voice even, serious]
“Or maybe they look at him and then they start looking at us. Flash like that? It’s a double-edged sword. He’s useful, but unpredictable.”

[Tony nods, tapping ash from his cigar, his expression tightening.]

Tony:
“Unpredictable gives me heartburn. We can’t afford wild cards in this thing of ours. He’s on a short leash. One more fuck-up, one more slip—he’s done. You got me?”

[The crew nods, the weight of Tony’s words settling over the table. Paulie leans back, muttering under his breath but not loud enough to challenge.]

Paulie:
“Short leash. Got it.”

[Tony sits back, smokes his cigar in silence. The neon flickers above them, music thumping faintly in the background, but the table is quiet—each man thinking about the risks Saul Goodman brings into their world.]


A day later...


[Soprano house, kitchen/dining area. Morning light streams in through the blinds. Carmela is making coffee, clinking cups onto saucers. Tony sits at the table in his robe, fork in hand, picking at eggs and sausage. The hum of the TV in the background fills the silence.]

Carmela:
“You barely touched your food. Something wrong?”

Tony:
[grunts, waving his fork]
“Just got things on my mind. Business things. Nothing you gotta worry about.”

Carmela:
[setting the coffee down in front of him, probing]
“You say that, but I know when you’re wound up. It’s written all over your face.”

[Tony exhales heavily, rubs his forehead. Before he can respond—BAM—the TV cuts to a loud Saul Goodman commercial.]

TV (Saul’s voice):
“Are you being shaken down by the city? Is zoning law making your life hell? Did some pencil-pusher at City Hall decide your property is suddenly theirs? Don’t sweat it! I’ll fight for your right to keep what’s yours. Criminal defense, civil disputes, parking tickets, DUIs—hell, if your neighbor’s cat looks at you funny, I’ll sue the furball! I’m Saul Goodman, and when the world’s out to get ya—”

[Saul leans into the camera with that greasy grin.]

Saul (on TV):
“Better Call Saul!”

[Tony freezes mid-bite, fork suspended. Carmela turns, frowning at the TV.]

Carmela:
“Who is this guy? He’s on every channel lately. He’s like a used car salesman in a suit.”

[Tony sets his fork down hard on the plate, jaw tight. He stares at the screen for a moment, then back at his food, saying nothing. Carmela watches him carefully.]

Carmela (suspicious):
“Tone… do you know him?”

[Tony doesn’t answer right away. The faint sound of Saul’s jingle echoes from the TV. Tony finally mutters under his breath:]

Tony:
“…Yeah. I know him.”

[The camera lingers on Carmela’s uneasy face, then Tony’s tight jaw as he chews his food angrily.]

[The ad fades out on the TV, replaced by morning talk show chatter. Tony stabs at his eggs like they insulted him. Carmela stands with her arms crossed, still staring at him.]

Carmela (firm, pointed):
“Tony…”

[Tony doesn’t look up. He chews, swallows, takes a sip of coffee. The silence drags. Carmela’s voice sharpens.]

Carmela:
“You said you know him. What does that mean, exactly?”

Tony (curt, deflecting):
“It means I seen his face around, that’s all. He’s a lawyer. Lotta commercials, lotta noise. Big deal.”

Carmela (not buying it):
“You don’t get that look on your face from some lawyer on TV. What are you involved in now, Tony?”

[Tony slams his fork down, the clatter echoing through the kitchen. He finally looks at her, his tone sharp but tired.]

Tony:
“Enough. I said it’s business, Carm. That’s all you need to know.”

[Carmela narrows her eyes, lips pressed tight. She picks up his empty coffee cup and walks back toward the counter, muttering just loud enough to sting.]

Carmela:
“Business. Always business. Until it’s not.”

[Tony leans back in his chair, exhales hard, rubs at his temples. The camera lingers on him—caught between his wife’s suspicion and the circus that is Saul Goodman.]

[Tony and Carmela are locked in that heavy silence. The only sound is the faint chatter from the TV. Then—]

[AJ shuffles in, half-asleep, hair a mess. He heads straight to the fridge, opens it, and stares inside like it’s going to give him life advice.]

AJ (mumbling):
“…we got any leftover ziti?”

[Tony and Carmela both glance at him, their argument paused mid-air. AJ pulls out a soda and some cold pasta, sets it on the counter without even noticing the storm he just walked into.]

AJ (oblivious):
“Hey, that Saul guy’s kinda funny. You ever see the one where he’s in the Constitution costume?”

[Tony shoots him a look sharp enough to cut glass. Carmela just exhales through her nose, almost laughing at the absurdity. AJ shrugs, pops the soda, and wanders toward the living room, leaving the tension hanging heavier than before.]

[Tony rubs his face, muttering under his breath.]
Tony:
“Jesus Christ…”

...

[In the Bada Bing, late afternoon. The place is mostly empty. The jukebox hums low in the background. Tony slumps in his chair near the bar, cigar in hand. Pussy’s nursing a drink.]

Tony (frustrated, waving his hands):
“Fuck is wrong with this guy!? It’s like I’m entrapped with Sally Jesse Raphael over here!”

Pussy (blinking, confused):
“He was a psychiatrist too? Saul Goodman?”

Tony (snaps, pointing at him):
“No! You even listening to me?! (exasperated) I’m sayin’—everywhere I look, this fuckin’ clown’s either on the radio, TV, billboards… It’s like he’s sittin’ on my chest twenty-four seven!”

Pussy (chuckles, shrugs):
“Tone, maybe that’s just his thing. The guy’s a hustler. He’s like us—except, you know, with law degrees and goofy ties.”

Tony (grumbles, taking a sip):
“Yeah, well, goofy ties don’t get ya clipped… but they sure as shit can get ME noticed. I don’t like bein’ noticed, Pussy. Not like this.”

[They sit in silence for a moment. The sound of glasses being cleaned behind the bar echoes.]

Pussy (leans in, more serious):
“So what do you wanna do about him, T?”

Tony (after a long pause, grinding his cigar):
“…Nothin’ yet. But he keeps playin’ circus clown with my name even two steps away from it, he’s gonna find out quick—this ain’t Vegas.”

[Tony glares across the table, Puffing smoke through his nose like a bull about to charge.]

Pussy (calm but firm):
“Maybe… he could use a little talking to...""

Tony (sharp glare):
...

Pussy (explains it lightly):
""You know, just a reminder. Keep it professional, keep the circus act away from our business.”

Tony (snorts, shakes his head):
“Talking to, huh? With guys like that, a talking to turns into a fuckin’ seminar. Man never shuts his trap.”

Pussy (leans in):
“Then maybe we make it a short seminar.”

[Tony leans back, considering it. He taps his cigar on the ashtray, the embers flaring.]

Tony:
“…We’ll see. But I don’t want blood spilled over some billboard lawyer with a pair’a clown shoes. If he don’t wise up… we put a little fear in him. Subtle. Understand?”

Pussy (nodding, smirks):
“Crystal.”

[They share a silent moment, only the low hum of the jukebox filling the room. Tony stares off, lost in thought, already weighing the consequences.]

Here’s how that tense silence in Saul’s office could play out:


The next day...


[Inside Saul’s office. The gaudy Constitution wallpaper and inflatable Statue of Liberty in the corner clash with the thick tension in the air. Tony sits in the client chair, hands clasped, staring at the floor. Saul leans back in his chair, tapping a pen nervously, watching Tony like he’s trying to read a storm cloud.]

Tony (sits there in silence):
...

Saul (also sitting there in silence):
...

[The silence stretches. The ticking of Saul’s novelty clock (Lady Justice holding scales that swing back and forth) fills the room.]

Tony (low, finally breaking it):
“…You like the sound of your own voice, don’t ya?”

Saul (nervous laugh, adjusting his tie):
“Well, uh, it’s kind of the product, y’know? Some guys sell meat, some guys sell steel. Me? I sell Saul Goodman™. And business is booming.”

Tony (slowly looking up, eyes narrowing):
“Boomin’ ain’t the word I’d use. More like… obnoxious. You’re everywhere. Radio, TV, every schmuck on the street’s seen your face. And now I’m sittin’ here askin’ myself: does this guy know how to keep his fuckin’ mouth shut?”

[Saul’s smile falters. He sets the pen down, folds his hands, tries to look serious.]

Saul:
“Tony… I’m a lotta things, but stupid isn’t one of them. I know how to keep a client’s business private. You think I’d be alive this long in Albuquerque—scratch that—in this line of work if I didn’t?”

Tony (leans in, voice low, dangerous):
“You better hope you’re right. ‘Cause people around me? They don’t get second chances.”

[Silence again. Saul swallows hard, but forces a grin.]

Saul:
“Message received, loud and clear. We’ll keep it between us, cross my heart, hope to… well, maybe not die, but you get the point.”

[Tony leans back, satisfied for now. Saul forces a chuckle, though sweat beads on his forehead. The office suddenly feels a lot smaller.]

Tony (shaking his head, muttering like he can’t believe it):
“You’re one hell of a media hazard, you know that?”

Saul (throws up his hands, half-grinning, half-defensive):
“Yep, here we go…–""

Tony:
Roko's Constitution...

Saul:
""–Look, Tony, I get it, I’m flashy. I got balloons, I got billboards, I got jingles that stick in your head worse than chicken pox. But that’s the game. People don’t hire the quiet lawyer, they hire the guy who’s louder than their problems.”

Tony (snaps, leaning forward):
“Yeah, and that loudmouth act of yours? It makes me the problem! People start connecting dots, suddenly I’m lookin’ like the fuckin’ mascot of your carnival act.”

Saul (trying to stay calm, smoothing his tie):
“Tony, I swear on the First Amendment—I don’t say names. I don’t even think names. Attorney-client privilege is tighter than my old man’s wallet. You’re safe. Nobody knows squat.”

Tony (narrows his eyes, coldly):
“You keep tellin’ yourself that. But remember somethin’, hazards? They get cleaned up.”

[Saul freezes, the grin plastered on but thinner now. He forces a laugh, nodding rapidly.]

Saul:
“Noted. Consider me… under the radar. Quiet as a church mouse from here on out.”

[Tony leans back, finally easing off, though the threat lingers like smoke in the air.]

...

[Inside Dr. Melfi’s office. The blinds are half-drawn, the hum of the city faint outside. Tony sinks into the couch, heavy and restless, while Melfi sits across with her notepad poised.]

Melfi (gently):
“You seem agitated, Tony. More than usual.”

Tony (snorts, waving a hand):
“Agitated? Try bein’ surrounded by fuckin’ clowns, doc!""

Melfi (calm as ever):
""...""

Tony (dials down his anger):
""...I got this lawyer… Saul Goodman. Big mouth, big commercials, big fuckin’ ego. Guy’s plastered all over TV and radio like he’s runnin’ for class clown.”

Melfi (nodding, calm):
“And that bothers you… because?”

Tony (glares, frustrated):
“Because it makes me look exposed! I sit across from him, talk business, then five minutes later I see his face on some billboard screamin’ about zoning laws and DUIs. He’s a media hazard, this guy. I don’t like it.”

Melfi (measured):
“Tony… is it possible you’re projecting some of your own anxiety about being noticed, about being seen? You’ve always expressed fear about exposure—law enforcement, the public eye…”

Tony (gritting his teeth, leaning forward):
“Doc, I ain’t worried about me bein’ seen. I’m worried about bein’ connected. There’s a difference. Exposure’s like poison—it spreads. And with this guy? He’s like a fuckin’ Typhoid Mary of lawyers.”

[Melfi studies him carefully, jotting notes, choosing her words.]

Melfi:
“So you don’t trust him.”

Tony (pauses, softer, almost reflective):
“…I don’t trust anybody. But with this guy? It ain’t about trust. It’s about control. He makes noise I can’t control, and that—” [he taps his chest hard] “—that’s bad for the heart.”

[Silence. Melfi lets the words sit. Tony exhales, sinking back into the couch, rubbing his temples.]

Melfi (after a pause):
“Maybe it isn’t Saul you need to manage… maybe it’s your reaction to him.”

[Tony smirks bitterly, shaking his head.]

Tony:
“Yeah? Tell that to my blood pressure.”

[Silence permeates the room]

Melfi (calm, leaning forward slightly):
“Perhaps it really wasn’t just about controlling noise, Tony. Maybe it’s solely and purely about control itself. Vulnerability has been proven to be humanity’s greatest weakness… and its greatest fear.”

Tony (silent):
""...""

[Tony stares at her, silent, jaw tight. He fiddles with his pinky ring, eyes darting away. The weight of her words hangs in the room.]

Tony (after a long pause, voice low):
“…Control, huh? You know, every time I think I got a handle on it, someone’s out there makin’ me feel like I’m on a leash. Media, feds, family… now this fuckin’ Saul Goodman. I can’t breathe without wonderin’ who’s watchin’.”

[Melfi nods, jotting a note, her voice steady.]

Melfi:
“And when you feel watched… when you feel vulnerable… what’s your instinct?”

[Tony leans forward, eyes cold, voice barely above a growl.]

Tony:
“…To make sure they’re watchin’ somethin’ else. Or not watchin’ at all.”

[A beat of silence. Melfi studies him carefully, but doesn’t push. Tony leans back, exhales sharply, his face clouded with frustration and a hint of fear he’ll never admit.]",1,1757980754.0,CirclejerkSopranos,1,1.0,False

1ni2b06,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ni2b06/my_mom_used_to_hang_my_art_on_the_fridge_horror/,My Mom Used to Hang My Art on the Fridge (Horror Short Story),"When I was a kid, Mom would hang my drawings on the fridge. When I was teen, Dad would hang my drawings on the fridge. And on the walls. And on the ceiling. And on the windows.  
  
One of my first core memories was of my Mom excitedly putting one of my drawings from school on the fridge. It was one of those typical, stick man family drawings that all kids do at some point, yet despite the mundanity of it, she was ecstatic. If her goal was to give me some sort of confidence, I guess it worked, because I spent the next 12 years drawing almost everyday.   
  
Every year in art class the teachers would normally have 2 or 3 projects where they would get you to make something for your parents as a gift. Dad was gone most nights, meaning I never got to spend quality time with him. So most, if not all of my projects were made specifically for my Mom. I'm not kidding when I say she would put anything I gave her on the fridge. By the time I was 10, there was so many it got to the point we ended up running out of space and couldn't find strong enough magnets to keep all the papers from falling off. Wanna guess what my Mom's solution to this was? That's right. Buy another fridge.   
  
The new fridge went in the garage and held all of my older drawings since she wanted to keep my newer stuff on display in the kitchen for everyone to see. I remember being confused about why we needed two refrigerators when we could put the old stuff in a box or a drawer, but my Dad liked the idea so I never thought much more of it. Little did I know at the time, he was only okay with it because it meant he had more room to store his beer and hide snacks he didn't want me eating on him. He told me I was banned from using the garage fridge until I turned 19, half joking that it was so I could be old enough to replace any beer that I'd inevitably drink without his permission. My Dad didn't teach me much, but when he did, It stuck.   
  
I followed that rule like it was gospel. Whenever I had friends try to convince me to take a couple of his dozens of bottles and cans, I always refused. Even if he wasn't around much, I loved my Dad and always listened to what he said. He rarely yelled, and never hit me, but there was still a threatening aura around him whenever he was upset, and no one, including my Mom, would argue with him. Mom always said that Dad knew best, and he usually did. Life was a breeze if you did exactly as Dad requested. His sports were the only thing that I'd witness him get truly angry over.   
  
When I was 12, we ended up moving to a new neighbourhood after my Dad got into a heated argument with our elderly neighbour beside us. Later that night I was woken up by my Mom to a loud commotion and flashing lights peaking in through my curtains. She got me dressed and brought me down stairs where we sat watching late night cartoons until my Dad came back inside. He told my Mom that the old man he was arguing with earlier had died from a heart attack. My Mom drove me to my grandparents for the night while my Dad stayed behind at the house. That single night turned into a week of no school while my parents found a new place for us to live. They wouldn't tell me why we had to move, but part of me knew it was because of our neighbour.   
  
When we got to the new house I was allowed to pick my own room, so obviously I chose the biggest bedroom with no confrontation from my Parents. In hindsight, I knew it was because they had started sleeping in separate rooms. This didn't concern me at the time because they still kissed each other, they still hugged, and professed their love for each other every day. I never saw them argue about anything other than what they wanted to get for dinner on the weekends. Eventually I got used to it and just thought it was a normal thing all adults do as they get older.   
  
I had to change schools when we moved, so I was all alone with no friends in a new place. I didn't take the change well, so my Mom made sure to give me extra attention whenever I got home from school. She never said it out right but I knew she knew. Things started to get a bit better after I met this cute girl in my grade. I can't seem to remember her name, but I do remember having the biggest crush on her for a while, but I was too shy to talk to her. One day when we were picking partners for a group assignment, she came up to me on her own accord to ask if I wanted to be her partner; Of course I said yes.   
  
She was my first and only friend in this new place. Our parents became quick friends too, bringing us to each others houses on weekends to have barbecues or just to visit. We would run along the creek in the woods behind my house playing Pirate and the Princess, pretending the creek was a the sea, and that the ground on either side were opposing island kingdoms. She always wanted to play outside, especially by the creak or anywhere with water. During the summer we went to the beach a lot where we'd swim until the sun went down, eating camp fire hotdogs and marshmallows. In the winter she taught me to skate, and the best places to go sledding after a fresh snow fall. I had never been happier, and soon enough, I had forgotten about all my worries.   
  
When I was 14 my Mom was diagnosed with a degenerative disease. She couldn't work anymore, meaning I wouldn't see my Dad awake very long for days at a time. Most nights when he came home, he would help get Mom settled in bed after giving her a bath, then go straight to bed himself. He ended up moving his mattress into her room, right next to her bed. He never wanted to be too far from her. Occasionally Dad would get sent home early from work, so Mom and I got to spend more time with him on those days, even though I could tell he would rather be in bed. On one of those rare nights, Mom had to keep nudging Dad awake on our first trip back to the movie theatres since her diagnosis. Dad, and I would spend all of our free time with Mom, especially since she needed help with almost everything nowadays, which also meant I couldn't hang out with my only best friend anymore. When our parents did meet up, it never lasted very long. Mom's social battery depletes a lot faster these days, not even able to keep her signature smile on for more than a couple of hours before she needed to rest.   
  
Despite the circumstances, Mom still put all the art I made for her on the fridge. I started drawing a lot more after her diagnosis. In fact, I drew so much so that we completely covered the deep freezer, Dad's garage fridge, Mom's bedroom mini fridge, and the kitchen fridge with my art. I suggested framing the ones she liked the most and hanging them up around the house, but she just laughed, saying that every inch of the walls would be covered in my art if we did that. She didn't want people thinking she went ""crazy"" already.   
  
The day I turned 16 was the last time my friend came to visit with her parents. We decided to take the trail in my back yard to the creek we used to call the seven seas. During the walk she introduced me to my first joint and we got stoned by the water. She made laugh harder than I've laughed in a long time, and life almost felt normal again. When the sun disappeared behind the tree's, I gave her my jacket as a cool autumn breeze brought us closer together. She laid her head on my shoulder, and when I turned to ask her a dumb question like 'why do leaves fall' she shut me up with a kiss. Our foreheads touched, nose to nose and we giggled incessantly until the moonlight shimmered in the creek. She whispered that she made something for me. She said it was like a lucky charm; That it would protect me as long as I kept it on me and thought of her. It was a small crocheted doll, dressed as a pirate, with a fancy mustache made of what looked like tuffs of my hair. I didn't question her, I just looked into her eyes, and she reassured me everything would be okay, kissing me on the cheek, before standing up with my hand in hers. She led me back to my place where she tried to give me my jacket back, but I said she should keep it and just give it back when I see her next. So she did. Our parents said their goodbyes, and we hugged each other one last time. I could see her sob as she waved goodbye through the rear windshield, and I cried too. It wasn't goodbye forever, but it felt like it. I gave the charm to my Mom that night, and told her it would protect her. All she needed to do was think of me.   
  
The next morning was too quiet. It was a dull, overcast day, with a seemingly permanent fog that painted my room in a brackish hue. I shuffled myself towards the kitchen to make food but noticed my Dad softly crying in the living room. I changed course for the living room, turning the corner where I could now see he was crying into bloody hands. Without a second thought I sprinted to Mom's room, throwing the door open to see her laying peacefully in her bed. I thought I saw someone peeping in through her window from the corner of my eye, so It took me a second to notice Mom's bleeding eyes, bloodied lips, and all the viscera pooling around her head, soaking into the pillow and sheets. At first I shook her softly, then violently as she continued to not respond. I grabbed the clasped hands sitting on her chest, holding my them to my lips as I prayed to a God I didn't know. In her hands was the little Pirate charm. I knew she was thinking of me when she died.   
  
I didn't get to see the girl for a long time. I kept the Pirate on a key chain dangling from my rear view mirror. At some point I decided I wouldn't rely on luck, so now it was just a reminder of better days that were long behind me. After months of investigation and all the wasted trials, they couldn't prove my Dad guilty. It didn't feel like a win because he was already broken. He lost his jobs almost immediately, having to go on government assistance to keep the lights on. I worked two jobs under the table and helped my Dad as best as I could during his prosecution. I didn't think he killed Mom like everyone else. The cause of death was bizarre for her condition and under most circumstances, wouldn't occur naturally. Luckily for us, that wasn't strong enough evidence to convince a jury, especially after they saw the state Dad was in. I would catch him sleep walking every night, and he was always standing in front of the fridge when I found him. I'd wake him up and he'd tell me he dreamt of Mom, showing him every new drawing she hung on the fridge, before being swept away by water and pulled into the deep sea.   
  
Miraculously I was able to graduate high school, even while working two jobs and making sure my Dad remembered to eat food between his bouts of night terrors. A week into college I came home to find a delivery driver attempting to drop off three, brand new refrigerators, which I sent back. I asked my Dad about it, but he got angry with me for the first time in years, rambling about how Mom would be upset if she doesn't have places to hang my pictures. I stopped drawing when Mom died, but somehow, Dad found piles of old drawings that younger me considered not good enough for the fridge. I was more focused on school now and ended up reconnecting with the Princess of the creek. She said she noticed the Pirate in my windshield and wanted to see me again. We go to the same college so she waited by my car until I was done class to surprise me. We talked for hours at a coffee shop, catching each other up on our lives. Hers was perfect in comparison, so I spared her the dirty details of mine. I didn't wanna kill the mood when we're talking like we were never apart. Somehow, I do remember her name all of a sudden. It was a whisper of a sound, softly billowing in my ear. A name I couldn't disrespect by butchering it with my dreamers tongue. I lost track of time, kissing the Princess goodbye before taking off back home. While I was gone, Dad had managed to get another delivery of refrigerators set up in the kitchen, with no where for them to be plugged in. He had already completely filled one fridge with my art and was starting on the second when I caught him. He was mumbling about how Mom will be so happy to see this when she's back from work. I fell to my knees, quietly sobbing as I watched my Dad go through 4 rolls of scotch tape to cover the rest of the fridges. We both slept on the kitchen floor that night.   
  
The morning comes fast and I'm back to my regularly scheduled programing. I struggled to move the fridges to the unused dining room, and made breakfast for both of us. While cleaning up I noticed even more drawings that I swore weren't there last night. Most were incoherent doodles or just entire pages of black scribbles. I bundled them together and threw them in the garbage while my Dad was distracted with his food. After showering myself, and getting Dad comfy in the living room with his favorite show and snacks, I left for class. When I got home every inch of the walls and ceiling were covered with the pages I had thrown out that morning. Even the windows were plastered with them, creating varying black and white collages of abstract figures and symbols. Dad was laying face up in the middle of the living room floor, surrounded in a puddle of his own urine. He was repeating lines from the bible under his breath, looking up at a collage of hundreds of eyeballs that he taped to the ceiling. He wouldn't say anything to me other than bible verses, and calling out Mom's name. He did seem to hear me, but was incapable of responding or moving a muscle unless instructed to, and even then you had to guide him with a gentle push in the right direction. For weeks after, my girlfriend would come over to help me with Dad and it took a lot of stress off of me. She was adamant on not letting me do this alone, so I couldn't stop her even If I tried. She would sleep over most nights, and even her parents came to see my Dad. We hoped it might jog his memory to reconnect with old friends but all it did was make him cry out for Mom more than he already was.   
  
I read somewhere that cat's can be great therapy animals, so when a pregnant stray kept scratching at our back door for the scraps of food my girlfriend had been sneaking her, I suggested we just adopt her. She gave birth to the cutest litter kittens I'd ever seen, and mama cat really seemed to take a liking to my Dad. She would sit in his lap and purr endlessly when she wasn't in Mom mode. When they got big enough, we showed the babies to my Dad and for the first time in a long time, his eyes lit up. He even leaned over to give mama cat a kiss on the top of her head and said how proud he was of her. It was a beautiful, but fleeting moment of clarity for him. Later on that night, we were startled awake to what sounded like a generator being run downstairs, quickly followed by several distinct shots of what I knew to be my Dads framing nailer. We looked at eachother panicked, and bolted downstairs towards the kitchen. My girlfriend screamed as she noticed the splattering of blood on the bottom step. Standing awkwardly in the kitchen next to an air compressor, framing nailer in hand, was my Dad. He was admiring a fridge he managed to drag in from the garage, which he had nailed the baby kittens to; Miscellaneous pieces of mama cat included. He turned to us with a genuine smile on his face, and said as calm as the creek ""Ran out of tape kiddo, sorry if I woke you. Mom's gonna be so happy when she sees what we made for her!"".   
  
I'm 25 now. We have a son of our own who's turning 3 this Autumn. He only got to see Dad a couple of times before he took his own life  by gouging out his eyes in the hospital. At least that's what they told me. Doctors said something along the lines of ""He couldn't stomach the guilt of his sins any longer"" or some bullshit I didn't care to remember. Now I'm just focusing on my career, my writing, my Princess turned Queen who gave me the Prince of my dreams. A legacy we can nurture together with our love. Something I couldn't have, something he deserves. I even started carrying the Pirate charm again. Something I used to think was just silly kid stuff now meant more to me than I could've imagined. I secretly learned to crochet and even some other neat tricks to surprise my Wife with a matching Princess for her Pirate. Complete with real hair that I snuck off the floor from when she butchered her haircut last week. She loved it, carrying it everywhere she went. For the most part, life finally settled down. A bright future was starting   
  
Last night my Wife found me sleep walking again. The only thing I remember is dreaming of crashing waves, pulling me further into the deep as thousands of eyes stare back up at me. When she woke me up, I was standing in front of the fridge.",2,1757980681.0,creepcast,2,1.0,False

I thought that caramelising the onions was an essential step for jap. Curry. And because they shrink down to next to nothing you need to use a large amount. 

For example I just made a curry like this:

250g pork belly, deeply browned in pot, removed

about 700g Onions, deeply caramelised in the pork fat.

Some carrots, some celery, little bit tomato paste into the pot

deglace with sweet red wine and some dry white. Reduced

Added knob of butter, flour. Then curry powder and shortly after veggie stock. Also grated an apple into it.

Blend. Pork in. Cocoa and super dark chocolate to taste. And cook for a little while.

Was quite good. Definitely should have added ginger for the pork. Little bit too sweet. Next time I either try adding instant coffee or skipping the wine.",0,1757980494.0,JapaneseFood,8,0.4,False

today, us managers noticed that the owner had removed all of the report pages from the kiosk.  the owner texted a message to the manager group chat explaining that they removed access to those pages for security reasons.  the owners said that they would text us each night to let us know how much we made in card tips.  but the other manager and myself both feel uncomfortable, we are questioning why we got locked out in the first place.  it’s strange to have to take their word for it on how many tips we’ve made, instead of being able to view it as we’ve always done.  and it’s strange they don’t trust us enough to be willing to have to text us each night.  tonight, the first night since the change, they already forgot to text me.  they did respond quickly after i reached out, but i could see them forgetting in the future 

the devil on my shoulder is questioning whether the owners are doing this because they want to be able to short everyone on tips.  some context is the owners haven’t been working as much at the shop recently because they’ve been focused on other priorities like their kids and other small business.  the owners used to share the tip pool on days they were working at the shop.  it was a little strange because they’d often not help with barista responsibilities but still share our tips.  but they haven’t been getting those tips anymore since they haven’t been working as much, so maybe they’re feeling the slightly lower income and making up for it…

the owners also reached out to us about needing to schedule a manager meeting for this week.  when they had been putting off having a meeting for months.  so maybe there will be answers there . but i want to be prepared to explain why i think we should be able to view our tips, without offending them or insinuating they would steal from us.  is it normal to not be able to view them?  or does anyone have advice on navigating this conversation?  i’m a relatively new manager, so need to tread carefully.  but this situation is ringing alarm bells.  i used to work at a restaurant where i had to log all my tips because the owner would always try to short me

I’m prepping for WRPF Canadian Nationals in the drug-tested division. I just learned that some pre-workouts and supplements can be contaminated with banned substances, even if the label looks fine. I really don’t want to risk getting popped on a test just because of something in my pre.

Right now, I’ve been using things like Raw Nutrition Essential Pre (Chris Bumstead’s brand), Mutant Madness, and sometimes Gorilla Mind energy drinks. I planned on dropping Mutant 6 weeks out and sticking with Raw + maybe some energy drinks for heavy days, but now I’m second-guessing all of it.

I know caffeine is allowed, but I’m not sure which pre-workouts or energy drinks are actually safe for tested lifters. I’ve heard about NSF Certified for Sport and Informed-Sport certified products but don’t really know what brands are available in Canada that hit hard enough for training.

So my questions are:
Are any pre-workouts 100% safe to take leading up to Nationals?
Should I drop all non-certified stuff a few weeks out and just stick to caffeine pills/coffee + creatine?
What do other drug-tested lifters here actually use for energy/pump going into a meet?

I’d appreciate any advice from lifters who’ve been through WRPF/CCES or IPF/WADA testing. I’m a bit nervous now that I know about this contamination issue, and I want to compete hard but not take any risks with my eligibility.

Thanks in advance!

The bathroom wasn’t designed.

It was consecrated.

Built into the eastern wing of the estate, it didn’t just reflect Aspen’s wealth - it revealed his knowing. 

Every inch was curated to feel like a shrine to the self, a place where flesh could remember its purpose.

The light came first. 

Not electric. 
Not artificial.

Sunlight, slanting through leaded glass windows stained in pale gold and stormwater blue.

The panes were partially veiled with hand-dyed silk that breathed with the breeze off the lake, casting long, shifting shadows across the floor like the robes of passing monks.

The floors, cool travertine, had been quarried in Italy, cut into long, holy slabs. 

Heated from beneath, they warmed Aspen’s soles as he crossed barefoot from bed to basin, the rhythm of his footfalls silent and intentional.

The tub, his favorite relic, rested in the center of the room like a ceremonial pool. 

An oval carved from black onyx, veined in silver, imported from Verona. 

It sat heavy, timeless. 

Like it remembered every ritual performed inside it. 

Every woman rinsed in oils.

Every man who’d gone under and emerged changed.

The rainfall shower towered opposite, a cathedral-sized chamber with brass and gold fixtures wrought by hand. 

Glass walls. 
Seven pressure settings. 

One button marked only with a symbol: a spiral inside a circle.

The house was silent.

Except… it wasn’t.

Aspen could feel it in the walls: a hum.

Subtle. 
Living. 

Like the mansion itself had breath.

Down the hall, Sequoia slept in her linen cocoon, her dreams laced with leftover pheromones and sacred heat. 

Their parents were away, as usual. 

Business in Milan. 

Aspen had stopped keeping track.

But he liked it this way.

No eyes. 
No voices.

Just the quiet knowing of his own reflection.

The mirror was full-body, seamless, backed in silver and smoked glass. 

It didn’t just show his body, it studied it.

He dropped the towel from his waist.

Naked.

The air greeted him like a secret lover, soft, fragrant, cool against the heat of his thighs. 

He was still half-hard from sleep, but it wasn’t from a dream. 

It was from memory. 

Something his body remembered from the night before, even if his mind wouldn’t name it.

He stepped forward, feet landing softly on the warmed stone, until he stood centered before the glass.

And looked.

His body was a contradiction:

Lush, but chiseled.
Slender, but powerful.

Skin the color of olivewood kissed by firelight.

Shoulders rolled back like a prince bred for war. 

Chest smooth, pecs softly defined. 

Waist narrow. 

His hips flared slightly, dangerous. 

Feminine only in how they seduced the eye into following them. 

His ass - high, tight, perfect - looked carved by someone who had known desire in every era.
 
And his cock - thick, smooth, flushed with blood - hung to the left like it had something to say.

He stared. 

Not with vanity.
With reverence.

“This is the weapon,” he whispered.

He turned slowly, admiring the play of shadows across his back. 

The way his deltoids caught the morning light. 

The glint of last night’s teeth marks, faint but still visible just beneath his collarbone. 

One on his hip. 

One near his inner thigh.

He hadn’t touched himself since waking.

But the ache was there.

Not lust. 
Not need.

Power.

He lifted his cock once, lazily. 

Let it rest heavy in his palm. 
His thumb stroked the crown.

“There is no greater illusion,” he murmured, 

""than pretending the body is not the altar.”

The mirror didn’t blink.
But something behind his eyes did.

A flicker.
A breath.

A brief sense that he was not entirely alone.

He moved through the space like he’d done it before.

Not last week. 
Not last month.

Before.

The ritual didn’t start with the towel.

It started with the box.

He opened the cabinet above the marble sink. 

Moved a few things aside, carefully, like they were watching. 

Behind a stack of folded cloth sat the wooden box from Tunisia.

Hand-carved. 

Sandalwood and dark brass.

Unlabeled. 
Unlocked.

But it smelled like secrecy.

And when he opened it, the whole room shifted.

Inside: seven vials. 

No names.
Just color. 

Texture. 

A faint sheen like smoke pressed into oil.

He didn’t need to read anything.

He remembered.

The memory came slow, like scent always does.

It had started with a dream.
A hotel room in Madrid. 

White sheets. 

A mirror above the bed. 

Aspen, still seventeen, on the edge of the mattress staring at a note that hadn’t been there the night before.

Hotel stationery. 

Thick. 

Cream-colored.

Written in a hand he didn’t recognize. 

Slanted. 
Almost ancient.

Myrrh.
Black pepper.
Rose Otto.
Coriander 
Sandalwood.
Anise.
Ylang -Ylang.

He didn’t know what it meant.

But when he folded it into his pocket and walked the streets the next day, his feet led him straight to the shop.

A narrow alley. 
A perfumery with no sign. 

Just glass bottles in the window.

Dust in the air.

Inside: a man in a black robe.
 
Wrinkled. 
Kind. 

Eyes the color of dark clay.
Aspen handed him the note.

The man smiled, not politely.

Knowingly.

“Ah,” he said. 

“You remember.”

“Many don’t.”

Aspen said nothing.

The man turned, moved to a high shelf, and pulled down the very box Aspen now held.

No label.
No pitch.

Just exchange.

Aspen paid in silence. 

Walked out into the heat of Tunisian sunlight. 

And when he opened the box again that night, he’d cried.

No tears. 
No sound.

Just sat on the floor of the villa in his ache like he’d just found a 
piece of himself.

Now, back in the marble sanctuary, Aspen moved without thinking.

He took one drop from each vial. Let them bead in his palm. 
His other hand cupped gently underneath, steadying the act like it was sacred.

And the smell…

It hit before he even rubbed  together.

Not fragrance.
Memory.

It was like sex in a temple. 

Like blood on silk. 

Like the kind of musk that lives in the folds of sheets long after a night has ended, but carries the echo of who you were when you let go.

He breathed in, and the bathroom disappeared.

FLASH.

He was kneeling in a stone room.

Naked.

Someone - a man? 

a god? - stood before him, cock hard, glistening, the smell of rose and spice curling from his skin.

Aspen opened his mouth.

Not to speak.
To receive.

“You’ll need these to remember,” the man said.

“You’ll need them to find your way back.”

FLASH.
Gone.

Back in the present, Aspen’s hand trembled. 

Just for a second.

Then the oils mixed.
 
Warmed.

And became something living.

He pressed the oil to his skin, one spot at a time:

Behind his ears, for what he hears but never speaks.

Over his heart, for the truths he hides even from himself

Just below his navel, for the power he pretends not to use

And then…

He paused.
Closed his eyes.

And slowly stroked a line from base to tip of his cock.

Just once.

A blessing.
A memory.

A trigger.

His hips bucked forward slightly. His breath caught.

He didn’t moan.
He didn’t speak.

But in the mirror, his reflection did.

Just a flicker.

A second mouth behind his own.

“We’ve missed you.”

He moved like a monk preparing for war.

Not hurried. 
Not casual.

Each motion carried intent, surgical, 
sensual, 
silent.

The mirror watched.

The oils still tingled on his skin, slowly seeping into his pulse points. 

It didn’t burn. 
But it reverberated. 

Like each spot now beat with a second heart. 

One behind the skin. 
One older than his birth.

He stepped to the marble basin and soaked a towel in hot water scented with eucalyptus, basil leaf, and a single crushed mint stem. 

He wrung it out slowly. 
Pressed it to his face.

And breathed.
Long draw in.

Hold.
Exhale.

He did it again.
And again.

Steam enveloped him like silk robes unfurling. 

It slipped down his back, between his thighs. 

His cock twitched once, casual, powerful. 

Not from arousal.
From activation.

You are not washing skin,
You are uncovering truth.

That thought came unbidden.
And still, he obeyed.

The cleanser came next, charcoal and volcanic ash suspended in fig sap. 

It looked like ink, but smelled like dark fruit and stone. 

He spread it over his face in upward circles. 

The grains scratched gently, enough to remind him he was alive.

But also… to remove what wasn’t.

It wasn’t just exfoliation.
It was exorcism.

Tiny flecks of someone else’s fingerprints, gone.

Lips from last night - gone.

The girl’s teeth marks - fading, but still visible. 

He let them stay.

“Some marks are meant to remain,” 
he whispered.

He reached for the body scrub next.

A coarse mix of crushed pink salt, almond oil, and three drops of labdanum resin. 

He pressed it into his shoulders first, grinding small circles into muscle. 

His back flexed, and the mirror rippled again, just for a second.

This time he saw movement.

Not just him.

Something behind him.
Or inside him, wearing him.

He didn’t stop.

Worked the scrub down his arms, over his chest, down his abdomen, his sides. 

He turned, braced a hand against the wall, and dragged the oil-salt blend down the curve of his ass.

Harder there.
Deliberate.

The bite mark near his hip looked purple now. 

He didn’t wince.
He smiled.

The masque came next. 

A thick, silvery-blue clay he kept in a small ceramic bowl. 

He didn’t use a brush. 

He dipped his fingers in and began painting his face like a soldier before sacred battle.

Forehead.
Cheekbones.
Under the eyes.

Across the jaw.

A single streak down the nose.
One dot over each eyelid.

He looked in the mirror.
Didn’t see Aspen.

He saw a mask.

And beneath it, a man becoming more than what he’d been.

He stepped back from the basin, skin glistening, heartbeat slowed.

He felt the oils still humming through his bloodstream.

And for a moment, just one moment, he realized:

He wasn’t doing the ritual anymore.

The ritual was doing him.

Every stroke had unlocked something.
Every scent had remembered something.

And now his body… didn’t feel fully his.

“This is what it means,” he said aloud,“to be ridden by something sacred.”

He looked into the mirror.
His eyes flashed green-gold.

Then dimmed.

But not before his reflection smiled.

He didn’t dress to be seen.
He dressed to be armed.

The masque had dried tight across his skin, cool and firm like lacquered stone. 

The oils had soaked in fully now, their frequencies settling. 

His cock hung thick and slow between his thighs, no longer calling for release, but commanding presence.

Aspen wiped the clay from his face with a hot towel and stood before the open wardrobe. 

Rows of shirts hung in silence, black, white, cream, charcoal. 

All silk. 
All fitted.

He reached for the black one.

Always black after a dream.

The fabric slid over his skin like breath over flame, impossibly light, but somehow grounding. 

His muscles flexed under it instinctively. 

The shirt wrapped around his torso like it had missed him.

He buttoned it slowly, fingers steady. 

Each one sealed the ritual further, like locking the spell beneath his ribs.

Button one: Memory.

Button two: Silence.

Button three: Desire, caged.

Button four: Power, disguised.

Button five: Access denied.

The collar kissed his throat.
The sleeves hugged his forearms.

The mirror shimmered again.

He paused.

His reflection had its hands in its pockets already.

He smirked.

Next: the trousers.
Black. 

Tailored to the half-millimeter. 

No belt. 

Just weight and fit.

He stepped into them like stepping into purpose.

Pulled them up in one motion. Zipped without effort.

His bulge shifted, naturally imposing, unapologetic. 

The fabric gripped it like it knew not to interfere. 

Just frame.

Aspen didn’t adjust himself.
He let it hang.

Let it show.

Let them look.
Let them ache.
Let them never understand.

He rolled his shoulders once.
Checked the angles.

The boy in the mirror was gone.
This was the Emissary.

He didn’t put on shoes.
He never did on days like this.

The ground needed to feel him.

Every toe press, every heel fall.
Let the house know he was coming.

Let the city feel the scent trail forming.

He grabbed one of his rings from the edge of the sink, onyx in a gold setting, and slid it onto his right middle finger. 

A subtle sigil carved on the inside.

He didn’t remember buying it.
Only waking up wearing it.

By the time he stepped into the hallway, the mask was on.

But the spell remained.

He was oil.
He was shadow.
He was fire.

And someone, somewhere, was already stirring from sleep.

Wet.

Mouth open.
Heart racing.

Not knowing why they ached.

But they would.
They always did.

The hallway didn’t creak.
 
It breathed.

Stone met flesh as Aspen stepped into it, barefoot, silent, his shirt whispering against his skin with every movement. 

The mansion was still, early morning quiet, but the air had changed.

Not temperature.

Pressure.

He was still.

But the scent moved ahead of him like prophecy.

A slow exhale of coriander, rose, and smoke, winding down the corridor like incense escaping a censer. 

Every molecule announcing something had awakened, and it was now walking.

Down the hall, Sequoia stirred in her sheets.

Her body turned once, then again.

Breath hitched.

A dream interrupted.

Her hand slid between her thighs, half-asleep.

She moaned softly and didn’t know why.

In the kitchen below, a spoon clattered to the floor.

One of the house staff blinked twice, confused, a flush rising to his cheeks.

He looked toward the hallway, heart beating louder, and for a split second, thought he heard a moan behind the walls.

He wasn’t wrong.

Aspen walked slowly.

No rush.

Each step its own sermon.
Behind him, his scent left a trail. 

Not just musk. 
Not just oil.

A pattern. 
A code.

Anyone walking through it would feel a chill at first.

Then a warmth below the belly.

Then a sudden memory they couldn’t place, of sex they’d never had, of a name they didn’t know but suddenly needed to say out loud.

Aspen passed a mirror in the corridor.

It didn’t reflect him.
It reflected what was coming.

Something taller. 

Horned. 

Beautiful.

A face like his, but older.
A grin that knew how the world would end.

He didn’t stop.

He reached the top of the stairs and paused.

Below, the house yawned awake, coffee machines, a quiet violin playlist someone queued on autopilot, a window sliding open to let in the lake breeze.

He gripped the banister once.

Pressed his thumb against the polished wood.

Left an oil mark that would not fade.

Then descended, barefoot, shirt hugging him like armor.


----


In the city…

A student on the Lakeshore GO train jolted upright.

A man in a Queen West condo spilled his espresso and didn’t know why.

A girl walking her dog near High Park stopped, closed her eyes, and whispered:

“He’s back.”

But she didn’t know who.

Aspen reached the last step.
Lifted his chin.

Let his bulge rest heavy against his thigh.

He walked toward the kitchen, toward the morning, toward whatever waited - 

already hunted, already divine.

He didn’t speak.

But if someone had listened closely…

They would have heard the Archive in his breath: and him repeating - 

They’ve been claimed.

I’ve begun.



●●○○● 




The First Memory





The night smelled like rain and old stone.

Mike lay stretched across the slanted rooftop of an abandoned antiques shop just off Lakeshore Road.

The shingles were rough under his hoodie. 

Cracked. 
Damp.

Each edge pressed into the skin of his back like a reminder, he was still here.

The air was heavy, cool, trembling with something he couldn’t name.

Not just weather. 
Not just night.

Something beneath it. 

Like the sky was layered, and one of the layers was thinning.

Port Credit slept around him, quiet streets, lamplight humming, a few cars slicing through the dark like afterthoughts.

Down the hill, the water of the harbor lapped against the docks, restless and silver under the early autumn stars.

He didn’t move.
Didn’t need to.

His breath was slow, but his body… ached.

Not the way a body aches after a fight.

Deeper. 
Older.

Like a door trying to open inside his chest.

He watched the stars flicker, watched one pulse twice, then vanish.

It didn’t fall.
It left.

That’s when he closed his eyes.

At first, only blackness.

Not peace.
Not rest.

Just a silence too dense to breathe.

Then - The world cracked.

Sand.
Heat.

Gold burning the horizon.

Mike gasped, but his body did not move.

He stood barefoot on polished stone, smooth and sun-warmed under his skin.

The smell hit first: incense, dust, metal, myrrh.

A scent he knew, bone-deep, though he’d never smelled it in this life.

A palace shimmered behind him.

White marble threaded with veins of gold.

Pillars carved with the faces of gods, some smiling, some stern, all watching.

His skin was different.

Browned. 
Luminous.

Clothed in linen, fine, loose, wrapped around a torso lean and sun-shaped.

He looked down at himself.
Fingers calloused. 

Feet strong. 
No shoes.

The sun had written its memory into his bones.

Around his eyes, he felt the weight of kohl, soft, cool, deliberate.

He reached up instinctively and touched his face.

The paint was real.

He could feel the drag of it beneath his fingers, anchoring him to this form.

He belonged here.
Not as visitor.

As vessel.

Ahead of him, a boy stood alone.
Barefoot.

Slim.

Not more than ten or eleven.

His eyes, amber set on fire.
Alive, watching, ancient.

He wore a crown too large for his head.

A simple one, golden, with a serpent curled at the brow.

The boy trembled, not from fear of Mike, but from something behind them.

Something vast.
Something coming.

Mike's hand moved to his hip automatically.

The hilts of twin curved daggers met his grip.

They welcomed him like old friends.

A voice rose up inside him:

“Protect him.”

Not an order.
A truth.

Mike dropped to one knee.

He placed his right palm against his chest, feeling the heartbeat steady, fierce, and then, with aching reverence, pressed his hand against the boy’s heart.

Their palms touched, flat.

The boy flinched at first, then stilled.

Trust bloomed across his face like sunlight cracking stone.

Like recognition, old as breath.

Mike spoke without thinking, without fear:

“My life is your vault.”

The ancient words burned his tongue, and soothed him in the same breath.

Like speaking them unlocked something coiled in his blood.

The boy whispered something back, but Mike couldn’t understand it fully.

Not yet.

It sounded like a name. 

Or a blessing.
Or both.

Behind them, the palace shifted.

A ripple through the stone.
The air thickened. 

Tightened.

Everything became watchful.

Danger.
Betrayal.

Mike smelled it before he heard it, the iron tang of blood waiting to happen.

The whisper of sandals across marble.

The flicker of a shadow sliding between columns.

The boy’s hand tightened in his.

Mike rose.

No words. 
No panic.

Only breath.

Only the opening of the channel inside his body where all fear melted into perfect focus.

The blades slid free of their sheaths without a sound.

The first assailant broke into the courtyard.

A man.

Armored in bronze.
Sword raised.

Mike moved.

Not fast.
Not slow.

Just… inevitable.

The first blade struck the man's weapon, disarming, spinning it across the marble.

The second blade kissed the attacker’s throat, paused.

Not cutting.
Not yet.

The man froze.

Mike locked eyes with him.

There was no hatred in Mike's face.

Only a promise:

“You will not touch him.”

The man dropped to his knees.

Mike kicked the sword farther away, silent. 

Calculated.

Protect first.

Kill only if necessary.
Always.

Another movement, a second attacker at the edge of the torchlight.

This one younger, faster. 
Less armored.

Mike turned, pivoted, caught the strike with both blades.

He twisted one, sliced the man’s thigh, not deep. 

Just enough to drop him.

The man cried out. 

Collapsed.

Mike did not finish him.
He stepped between the fallen man and the boy.

Shield. 
Sentinel.

The courtyard stilled.

Somewhere in the distance, drums began to beat.

Slow. 
Ominous.

Or maybe they were inside his chest.

The boy let go of his hand.
He reached forward.

Touched Mike’s face, gently.

Just a gesture.

Silent.
Timeless.

Recognition.

Like saying: You were always here.

Mike's body jerked.

The memory tore away like a receding tide.

He gasped, clutching the shingles of the rooftop like a anchor.

Above him, the stars spun in slow, aching spirals.

His chest rose and fell like surf.

Not panicked.

Just… shifted.

Changed.

His palms burned.
Not from heat.

From something older.

He turned his hand upward.

There, across his right palm, a faint spiral.

Not ink.
Not visible.

But he felt it.

Branded beneath the skin.

Not from tonight.
Not from this life.

From before.
He sat up slowly.

The world around him felt… thinner.

As if he could peel back the night sky and find gold behind it.

He whispered, rough and broken:

“Sobekneferu.”

The name tasted like blood and honey in his mouth.

He didn’t know how he knew it.
He just did.

It had always been inside him

Waiting.

As he said it, something moved beneath his skin.

A flicker. 
A warmth.

A memory not fully returned, but circling.

He looked down at his hands.
They did not tremble.

They had never felt more steady.

More alive.
More true.

Mike exhaled slowly, feeling the ancient breath echo in his lungs, feeling the pulse of warriors and guardians stretching back beyond counting.

He stood.

Above him, the stars pulsed once.

And for just a moment, he thought he saw her again:

The woman in red silk.

Watching from the rooftop’s edge.

Her eyes rimmed in black.
Her mouth soft with knowing.
Her silhouette crowned in gold.

She did not speak.
She only bowed her head slightly.

A teacher greeting a student
who had finally begun to remember.

And in his chest, where the ache had lived for years, Mike felt something shift.

Not pain.

Readiness.

He whispered into the dark, his voice low and certain:

“I am Michael of the Vault.
I remember.”
 





○○○●○





 

They Follow 




They Followed Him.

He didn’t walk through the hallway, he moved through it, like a pulse of heat.

Every locker creaked open slower.

Every step echoed louder.
And every gaze… found him.

Aspen wore his Spartans jacket like it was armor, collar popped, sleeves rolled, the school’s crest stretched across his thick, flexing back.

Below it?

Dark grey joggers that clung like temptation.

The outline of his weight wasn’t just visible, it was unignorable.

Girls turned their heads like leaves drawn to sunlight.

Guys looked down… then back up, trying not to compare.

Every step he took said:

I know what I’ve got. 
And you wish it was yours.

He paused by the vending machine.

Pretended to glance at the options.

What he really wanted?
To feel the eyes.

Behind him, she watched.

A senior. 
Quiet. 

The kind who only ever got straight As and wet dreams.

But Aspen’s presence broke things.

Like rules.

And routines.
And underwear.

He turned without looking.
Walked down the hall.

Not fast. 
Not slow.

Just enough to let the weight of his girth swing once.

She followed.

Her mouth dry.
Pulse racing.

Body already responding.

Aspen stepped into the boys’ bathroom.

Didn’t look back.
Didn’t need to.

He knew she’d come.

They always did.

The bathroom was still.

Too still.

Tiles echoed her breath.

Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, dim, flickering, like even they couldn’t bear to interrupt.

Aspen leaned back against the stall wall, arms folded across his broad chest.

He wasn’t posing. 
He didn’t need to.

He was the moment.

Every inch of him a weapon.

A gift.
A god.

She stood in the doorway, caught in his gravity.

It was like her pulse didn’t belong to her anymore, it belonged to him.

His eyes caught hers.

Sharp. 
Commanding.

He tilted his chin, barely.
And she obeyed.

She dropped to her knees, breath already shaking.

Not because she was nervous, because her body knew what was coming.

It felt it.
It ached for it.

Her hands slid up his thighs, fingertips tracing the seams of his joggers.

He was already hard.

She could see the heavy weight shifting with his every breath.

Thick. 
Girthy. 

Demanding.

When she brushed it, even through the fabric, he twitched.

And so did she.

She gasped softly, her fingers trembling as she gripped the waistband.

He didn’t move.

Didn’t help.
Didn’t need to.

She peeled the joggers down slowly, breath catching when his length dropped free.

God.

It hung there like a secret too big to be kept.

Tan. 

Smooth. 

Beautiful.

Veins thick and proud, crown flushed and heavy with need.

The scent coming off it made her dizzy.

She whispered something, maybe his name, maybe a prayer.

Then it spilled out - yes.

Her lips parted.
And she tasted him.

The air snapped.

The lights seemed to dim.
The world stilled.

Salt.
Heat.

Something wild.
Something alive.

She moaned against the tip,
then deeper.

Her throat opened around him as she sucked, not eager, but worshipful.

Aspen exhaled through his nose, slowly.

The only sound he made.

His hand slid into her hair, not to guide - just to anchor.

To remind her who she knelt for.

Her hands pressed into his thighs.

Her hips shifted.

She was grinding - grinding against nothing.

Desperate to feel something, anything, everything.

And then - she broke.

Her thighs shook.
Her body locked.

A guttural moan climbed up from deep inside her.

She came.
Hard.

It splashed the tile beneath her unhindered by underwear.

Hot. 

Sudden. 

Soaking.

A puddle.

But she didn’t stop.

Her mouth moved faster.
Her moans deepened.

She was crying now, tears of pleasure, of disbelief, of something she’d never felt before.

And Aspen?

Still silent.
Still watching.

Except for the slow, flexing twitch of his cock.

He was feeding her.

Letting her taste his power, his heat, his truth.
And she drank like it was her last chance.

She couldn’t stop.
Wouldn’t stop.

Her mouth had become a prayer.

And Aspen?

He was the answer to every one.

She gagged once, eyes watering, throat full -

Then pushed deeper.
His cock twitched again.

This time, Aspen moved.
Not much.

Just a slow roll of his hips - forward.

Just enough to let her know:
I decide when you break.

She gasped around him.
Her body trembled.

A second orgasm hit, violent and desperate.

Another flood hit the floor.

He looked down at her, hair tangled in his grip, lips swollen, tears painting streaks down her cheeks.

She was gone.

All that remained was need.

He took a breath.

Then pushed in deeper, slow.

Deliberate. 
Unavoidable.

She moaned and tried to hold on.
But it was over.

Aspen twitched once more.

Then released.

She felt it first - hot, thick, endless.

And then she broke.

Her entire body spasmed as he came.

She clung to his thighs, face buried, drinking him down like lightning in water.

The floor beneath her was soaked.

The stall walls trembled.

Her moans turned to sobs.

And Aspen?

He let out a slow exhale.

That was it.
That was all.

He pulled back.

Tucked himself away.

No words. 
No kiss. 

No gesture.
Just a look.

Like he’d marked her.
Possessed her.

Like she’d tasted something forbidden and now the world would never satisfy her again.

She sat there, knees soaked, lips trembling.

Eyes wide.

Aspen turned.

Opened the bathroom door.
And as he walked out, she whispered:

“Thank you…”

He didn’t look back.

She was still on the floor.
Still trembling.

Still in love with the taste.

And Aspen’s smirk returned just as the door clicked shut.

He didn’t look back.
Didn’t say anything.

Just zipped up slow, like it mattered.

Like putting his cock away would silence what just happened.

It didn’t.

The bathroom door swung shut behind him with a soft metal click.

Too quiet.

He didn’t stop walking.
Didn’t pause.

His steps were steady.

Shoulders high.
Jacket still perfect.

But everything inside him was, breaking.

The hallway was loud again.

Buzzing.

Alive with kids and lockers and noise.

He hated it.
He loved it.

Because it meant no one knew.

They smiled at him.

Nodded.

Moved out of his way.

God walking among insects,
he used to think.

But now?

Gods don’t feel like this.

His joggers still clung.

Still showed the outline of what she just swallowed.

He could feel it - his weight, softening slowly but still flushed in heat.

Like it hadn’t forgotten the feeling.

Like it wanted to go back.

He didn’t.

Not because he felt guilt.

But because guilt meant something human.

And this?

This was something else.

Every step echoed.

Not through the floor, but in him.

Her hands.
Her mouth.

That whisper:

“Please.”

He heard it again.
And again.
And he hated how much he loved that she said it.

He passed a classroom window.
Caught his own reflection.

Sharp jaw.
Sharp eyes.

Beautiful monster.

He looked like control.
But all he felt was the ache.

Not in his body.
In that secret place between breath and bone.

The one that woke up when someone gave in.

And then left him starving.

You took it again. 

And now you don’t know what to do with it.

He kept walking.

Not fast.
Not slow.

Like nothing had happened.

But everything had.
And the worst part?

He wanted it to happen again.

Looking for queer female friends (Delco, PA area)

Hey! I’m looking to make some queer female friends in their 30s around Delco. I moved here last October and while I’ve met some cool people, I’d really like to build lasting friendships. I’m in a happy, committed relationship, so I’m only looking for platonic connections with others who are in the same boat—just to keep things clear.

A little about me:
	•	I’m a writer.
	•	Big into music (Sleep Token is my current obsession).
	•	Witchy/mystical stuff is my jam.
	•	420 friendly.
      

Mostly I’d just love some down-to-earth friends to grab coffee with, see a show, or get a drink. On a deeper level, I want friends to share happy moments, celebrations, and defeats. I am a safe space and this is a no judgement zone. If you’re in the area and looking for the same, hit me up ",9,1757979228.0,LesbianActually,2,1.0,False

Anytime he's asked to write a correction or is criticized for his lack of sources he seems genuinely upset, and I don't think he's faking it. Take that scene where he goes crying to Klebanow because Gus won't print his Story about the homeless family. If that was a real story and not a lie, I don't think Scott would feel any different about Gus rejecting it. He gave him a believable Story, and in his mind that's all that matters.

Anyway, I read a lot in this sub about people's sleep changing for the better after quitting. Do you guys also notice a change after waking up?

As always I encourage folks to post their own findings both for good scores as well as to avoid and save folks the bother.

**Poland**

- Hauldi’s (only puts out rotted or spoiled refuse)

- Dollar Colonel (bins are in a raised concrete area hard to access, lots of broken glass & trash on ground that can risk flattening a tire)

- Walblue’s/CeeVees pharmacies (padlock and barrier fence their bins)



**Boardman**

- Honeyfaked Hams (just unfinished dine-in trash)

- Domiblows Pizza (just cooking trash)

- Little Emperor’s Pizza (has a long-term encamped unhoused individual who sleeps/lives behind the bins and is clearly reliant on any scraps there for survival, I’ve written this location off simply because clearly they need it more than I do, your mileage may vary; other LC locations like Columbiana are a far drive off but are worth checking)

- SaveABunch (a couple times in spring yielded some candy scores but since then the bins have just gotten extremely nasty, almost toxic to breathe near, always stagnant liquid filled in the bottom and the store is clearly making some effort to destroy and smear around any useful products tossed out)

- Dollar Shrub (locks bins; pretty much all the Dollar Shrub locations in the county do this, for some reason they think they’re better than DG)

- Bedsheets Gas (only tosses food waste and packaging, though since they’re open 24/7 and cheap I recommend getting a loyalty card and make use of their great low gas prices to fill up your tank after a night of driving around diving)

- Plunkin’ Donuts (just food waste and packaging; technically they DO throw out some pastries but never in boxes, only trash bags, so if you’re hungry enough to sort through bags of half-finished coffees and sticky melted donuts, have-at)

She's very liberal.  She took a leave of absence earlier this year, and told me that she's got some ""personal things"" that she had to address.  When she said that, I was 98% certain that she was discussing with her partner whether she would be able to stay with the VA long term.  

Got a letter in the mail today letting me know that she's made the difficult decision to leave the VA towards the end of the year, and that she'd be working with her patient census to get connected with another provider at the VA before  she leaves.  I appreciate that beyond words.

But I've been with her for more than 3 years, and have built a significant patient/provider relationship with her, to the point where I would consider her to be something of a friend.  Definitely someone that I would grab coffee with outside of the office.

But, like I said, I've been expecting this for months. It sucks that good providers are being pushed out of the VA because of the policies that are being put into place. I just hope that the provider that I get moved to will be as good as my current and soon former psychiatrist.

Secondly, those are my symptoms:
Dizziness, ringing in the ears, vertigo, numbness and tingling in the chest, arms and legs (not always), shortness of breath, muscle tension, especially in the upper part, such as the shoulder and the area next to it, chest pain, rare blurred vision, a feeling of impending doom, and gas retention from the upper and lower parts that I am unable to expel.

From 8 months my life changed upside down, I was drinking coffee as always and then after maybe 30 minutes I got super dizzy and that's freaked me out .. and I was about to fainting and called the ambulance and they come and checked me up My blood pressure, sugar and vital signs were fine. From that moment on, fear began to control me and I spent about two months going from one clinic to another to discover what was wrong with me until, by chance, my relative told me to visit the internal medicine clinic, so I went to the clinic and do upper endoscopy and the results are: incompetent at 40 cm in Cardia and small fundal polyp in stomach.
The doctor gave me nexium and say you're fine.. after that I take it maybe about a month and stopped.

After that, I got tired of the stabbing, numbness, chest tightness, and suffocation. I visited the emergency room a million times and they did x-rays, an ECG, lab tests, a Stress test, and an ultrasound. They said everything was fine and I had nothing wrong with me, and I'm still scared :)

For your information, I have had chronic constipation since childhood, and my diet is neither good nor bad, just average. I have partially stopped drinking coffee and have started drinking decaf with a little caffeine. I use nicotine pouches. I am a semi-athletic person, meaning I move and exercise sometimes not always.
The past few months when I run or play football I get so tired and sometimes not :) sometimes I feel shortness in my chest :)
Finally I'm so tired from the worrying that I'm having a stroke:)

1ni1hu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1ni1hu5/the_ache_that_remains/,The Ache That Remains.,"   I think about you the way some storms never stop—loud at first, then the sky goes quiet, and the aftertaste of rain lives in the air forever. I don’t just remember you; I keep replaying you, frame by frame, until every small thing is worn raw. Your laugh becomes a loop I can’t pause. The way you looked at me becomes an accusation. I wake up to your absence like a fresh bruise and pretend the dull throb is normal. It’s not. It’s obsession in slow motion.

I loved you like aedible mistake—knowing it would burn me if I stayed close, yet tasting it anyway. There’s a part of me that catalogues everything you did, as if a ledger will explain how this tenderness could turn so poisonous. I have memory after memory arranged like evidence: the nights I stayed awake listening for you, the promises that sounded like anchors and turned out to be stones, the small mercies you gave that began to feel like cruel jokes. I keep those items and press them flat so I can see the shape of what I lost.

Sometimes I find myself waiting for you in places that make no sense—an old coffee cup, a song I used to hate and now can’t stop hearing, the exact corner of a street where we once stood and pretended the world would always be ours. I stand there waiting for a return that will never come, and the waiting makes me smaller each time. It’s not rational; obsession rarely is. It’s the mind trying to force a story to have a different ending.

It hurts the way an infection does: quietly, then all at once. I tell myself I should hate you to make the ache stop, but hate is too generous—it would mean I’d moved on enough to feel righteous. Instead I carry this thin, stubborn longing that keeps breathing for both of us. I still imagine you reading this, or not—both scenarios sting. If you read it and keep walking, I will be both relieved and destroyed. If you read it and return, I know I will hand you my heart again like it’s an offering I’ve refined through suffering.

I find traces of you in my smallness now: the way I lower my expectations, the way I apologize too quickly, the way I rehearse conversations that will never happen. It’s humiliating and intimate to confess how much space you occupy in me. I don’t want to admit that I would choose this crater of feeling again, but I would. That choice is the cruelest part—the knowledge that pain was the price and I would have paid it twice.

There’s a part of me that wants to stitch these pages closed and never breathe your name aloud. There’s another part that can’t stop writing it, like a ritual that keeps the wound honest. I don’t want to romanticize the damage, but I won’t pretend it’s small. This love carved something out of me and left the raw interior exposed. I am tender in ways I never asked for and I am terrified that tenderness will make me repeat the same mistakes.

So I hold this ache like a proof that I was capable of the terrible, holy thing of giving myself away. It has ruined my sleep and sharpened my loneliness, but it has also taught me what depth feels like—brutal, authentic, unbearable. I am learning to carry the memory without dissolving into it, though some nights I fail spectacularly and sob until I can’t tell if the sound is grief or a kind of prayer.

I loved you. I lost you. That should be clean and finite, but it isn’t. It lingers, follows me into rooms I thought were mine, turns quiet into a cavern where your voice echoes and never quite fades. I am obsessed, I am broken, and I am still somehow grateful—for the capacity to feel this much, even when it kills me softly every day.",12,1757978526.0,UnsentLettersRaw,3,1.0,False

I’m 32 now. When I was 13 (and younger), I was relentlessly bullied by a boy who had autism and ADHD. I want to be clear: I know neurodivergence doesn’t equal cruelty. My fiancé is autistic and has ADHD too, and he’s never once hurted me in any way. His parents taught him empathy, boundaries, and accountability.

But this boy? He stabbed me with thorns. Hit me in the stomach when I was already injured. Chased me, cornered me, and hurt me in ways that left me bleeding—physically, emotionally, mentally. I developed CPTSD because of him and many other trauma's. And i still have a needle phobia because of him because like is said, he used to stab me with thorns. And the worst part? His teachers and mom told me to “get used to it” because “he couldn’t help himself.” I was taught to accept abuse as normal. That my pain didn’t matter.

Fast forward 18 years. Two years ago, I ran into him at a local coffee shop where he worked. I didn’t recognize him at first. He tried to say something, maybe an apology.. I only caught “how are you doing now?” I said “Yeah… alright,” and he left. Around thirty seconds later, it hit me. That was him. The boy who made my life hell. And I didn’t get to say anything at that moment because i simply didn't know.

Now today I walked past that school where it all happend and feel like I’m 12/13 (& younger) again. I see all the flashbacks, all the thinks he did to me... i almost broke in front of my fiance today who knows the whole story... and i info dumped all that on him once again. but i just wanted to heal.. i just can't let my ptsd win and let me ""Avoid places that make me think of my trauma"" all the time. i really tried... I’ve done so much healing. I’ve built a life, found love, reclaimed my voice. But seeing him ripped open a scar I thought was closed. I almost feel like messaging him on Facebook to ask what he wanted to say, but part of me feels like that makes me weak. Like I’m reopening something that should stay shut.

I know people change. I know he might be sorry. But I also know I was his punching bag. And I don’t know if I can or should forgive someone who never had to live with the trauma they caused.

So Reddit…  
Is it normal for me not wanting to forgive? Or maybe want to tell him what his past actions did to me? 

Should I message him or leave it buried?  
Is it okay to still be angry, even if he’s changed?

Even almost 2 decades later?

I’ve been doing intermittent fasting and cutting out breakfast and lunch most days. I’ve been losing 1.5-2lbs a week and am now down to 218lbs. According to a calorie calculator, I’m eating about 1018-1518 calories a day.

I started at 233. And in order to maintain that weight, it says I’d need 2072 calories a day. 

My goal weight is 150. When I look at the calorie calculator for 150, it says I’d need 1620 calories per day. A 452 calorie difference.

My question is… if I get down to that goal weight, and then started eating 2072 calories again… would I gain weight back up to 233? I’m fine with regaining some weight. I just don’t want to go back to over 200 ever again.

Some days I’m hungrier than normal, so that’s when I might eat lunch. I’m wondering how much I’m going to have to be conscious of that at goal weight. Id like to be able to drink morning coffee with sugar and cream again, even with skipping breakfast. Or eat dessert again.

1ni1elg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ni1elg/everything_is_fingers_part_3_final/,Everything is Fingers - PART 3 (final),"Finally, I’d found something familiar-looking, although I didn’t know if I were looking at the back of the Eidelberg or if it were a building that had been designed by the same architect. I stopped and looked around for anything else familiar.

That guy in the trench coat was off to the left with his back against a retaining wall. He was smoking a finger, taking a long drag until it burned down almost to the third knuckle before plucking it away and blowing a pattern of smoke that looked eerily like a gang sign.

He was the one who started all this. My instinct told me to flee, that nothing good was going to come from this, but I was already on the way toward him.

“You,” I said, pointing toward the Eidelberg with a thumb. “You were pointing at me earlier. Why?”

He must have been watching me the entire time from when I spotted him to when I stopped a few feet in front of him. His brow hooded most of his face until he lifted his head. I'd expected his eyes to have been jutting fingertips, but they were just black irises under a buzzing sodium lamp.

He didn’t speak and he may not have been blinking, either. He just stared at me for a few more long seconds before letting his eyes drift off to something in the middle distance.

“Hey, you look at me.” I snapped my fingers in his face. He looked at my hand intensely, then smiled wide, revealing the incomplete set of blocky, deeply-yellowed teeth that began at either side of his mouth.

He laughed, then wiped his mouth. The trench coat was unbuttoned and one side slipped, revealing bare skin, but weird bare skin.

The hand went back in his coat, closing my short view of whatever was going on in there.

“Why did you point at me?”

The smile turned into a half-interested smirk. This could have been ennui, a language barrier, or the man could’ve had a brain made of mashed fingerling potatoes. I considered grabbing him by the lapels and giving him a good shake to see whether that helped.

But before I could move, he took one step forward, opened his trench coat, and said, “Ha!”

It was supposed to be a flash. Maybe that was why he liked to hang around here. But it was all fingers from his collarbone down. Long ones, short ones, gnarled, manicured, some with painted nails—like he’d collected them from anybody who’d had one or two to spare. Skinny fingers as long as my forearm wiggled out of his beard. Save for the clusters of tiny fingers that didn’t appear fully formed, starting at the edges of his pecs and trailing down to his hips, they all twisted, curled, or stretched to point at me.

Even the thatch of pubic hair had wire fingers coming out of it, like someone was standing behind him and was about to pick him up by the crotch. The tiny fingers were like cilia, gently swaying in a pattern like each one was signaling for me to come closer.

This was by far the scariest of anything I’d seen tonight, but I was too mentally exhausted for the flight part of fight-or-flight. I punched him.

He fell back against the retaining wall, and emboldened, I stepped closer and kicked him in the stomach. Several of the fingers broke and that was a very satisfying sound. I’d connected with about a dozen which were pointing everywhere *except* at me. I didn’t know whether this was all his fault, but I took it out on him anyway.

I’d like to say I blanked out. That my mind snapped and I couldn’t control what my body was doing. But no, I was fully conscious of everything. Even when I knocked him to the ground and spotted a chunk of concrete about a foot away from his head. I picked up the mostly intact cinder block and brought it down on his head.

I did that a few more times before doing the same all over his body, making sure to break as many fingers as I could. Even the particularly freaky baby ones. I smashed all I could until I was too tired to pick the block up. The fingers I hadn’t broken shrank back into his flesh. The rest hung uselessly.

I left the block on his chest. I didn’t feel bad about what I’d done, but I'd broken a promise to myself that I'd never get in a situation like this again.

Nobody was around, at least as far as I could see. I didn’t have the energy or the inclination to climb the retaining wall, and it was a pretty safe bet that was the Eidelberg behind me. Going around it would take more time than I was willing to give, so I tried the back door.

It was open.

I really wasn’t familiar with the building, so it took a bunch of right turns before I found the atrium, and from there, spotting the lobby was easy. I pushed my way out those doors for, hopefully, the second and final time. There were people outside, but they were doing things that didn’t involve looking at me, so I didn’t care. I crossed the street, got in my car, and drove off as I was putting on my seatbelt.

The journey home was as boring as I could’ve hoped for. I wasn’t supposed to use my phone while I was driving, but I had to know whether my wife had called or tried to message me.

‘B HOME SOON?’ she’d texted almost an hour ago. I looked at the time. It wasn’t as late as I’d guessed.

I responded that I had gotten held up with something at work. A lie, but the truth would go down much easier with pizza. I ordered from a place on the way.

There was nothing extraordinary about the restaurant, the person who took my payment, nor the pizza itself. I breathed like it was the first time I’d tasted air and got back in my car. I felt good again.

My wife answered the door in something sexy. Life was already eighty-percent better. I tossed the pizza box on the coffee table and let her lead me upstairs.

She kissed me right outside the bedroom. Her mouth was sweet, but I couldn’t place the flavor. It was nice, though. We continued kissing and squeezing parts of each other until I scooped her up and tossed her onto the bed. This was *exactly* what I needed.

Then her face began changing. I couldn’t tell what it was at first, but the transformation was fast. I had already dropped trou and stood in horror with a puddle of pants around my ankles.

In seconds, her entire upper body had shifted into a giant finger. It wasn’t like one of those sexy werewolf transformations like in the movies. I almost threw up. She opened her legs in invitation. It kind of looked like that thing boys used to do when two of them put their palms together and connect them, vertical to horizontal, and the horizontal one would spread his hands to see the faux vagina they’d made.

I took a step back, not able to process the information my eyes were transmitting to my brain. I looked down at my erection.

It was pointed at me, and of course, was a finger. A bigger than average one, but that was hardly comforting.

I must have fainted after that because I woke up here.

I've had nothing but time to think since then. Nothing to do but pretend to get better and keep retelling this story to myself. I have to keep the details as sharp as possible so I can be ready.

*Pretend* to get better isn’t exactly true. I do have work to do. They gave me soft white mitts to wear so I don’t wake up screaming when I see my hands. Once, I was able to get a plastic knife and I tried to saw my left hand off. I didn’t make it very far, but it was the effort that counted.

Part of my therapy involves sitting in a controlled environment where I sit and remove one of the mittens and just stare at my own fingers. The doctors call this condition somatoparaphrenia. They have me say what I want my hand to do and then do it as a means of reteaching my brain that these are indeed my fingers.

My wife comes sometimes. She looks like she used to—not like a finger, that is—but I honestly have difficulty touching her, at times. When I was killing the man in the trench coat, his skin hadn’t felt right. Pliant in the way skin wasn’t supposed to be. Wrong like Gee’s skin had been wrong. Like had I’d pushed hard enough, my hand would have gone right into him. Right through him. I didn’t want to touch her and feel *her* skin like that. Seeing her that way had broken me up good, like a sledgehammer to a cinderblock. The one good thing about being in here was the people helping me piece me back together.

I wanted to touch her. But I couldn’t do anything that involved hands with my wife.

Even though I’m getting better, this isn't over. The pendulum is just swinging in the other direction. For anyone paying attention, you may already know what's coming next. I got a clue, then passed it to you one thousand, four hundred, ninety-five words into this story, then a couple more times after.

I listen and watch to get a better color of what it'll be. It’ll start with people. It’ll start with flesh. But as they change, I’m changing. I’m getting ready. I’ll learn how to act like people again. My wife thinks I’m getting better, and I’m using her to mold this new face. The sooner I get “better,” the better.

I could leave anytime I want. But what happened that night really did do a number on me. I mean, I *killed* a guy.

This therapist talks a lot more than she listens. I wouldn't waste my time trying to convince her something was coming. Especially after what she just did.

“You think you could just stop, close your eyes, and take a deep breath the next time you start seeing all those extra fingers?” she’d asked just a minute before.

“Yeah,” I’d said. That first night, I said all kinds of things—*that were true*—that I regret now because they were using that against me. Obviously, they didn’t believe me. But also, because they didn’t care enough to get what I’d said right. I didn’t say ‘extra’ fingers. I said fingers where they weren’t supposed to be. The fingers were real. Flesh, and everything else had all exchanged atoms with something from some sort of side-universe where everything there was a finger. Fingers that had all come to this universe to point at me. Even my... my... y’know. It still almost makes me scream when I think about it too long. 

I'd touched some of those fingers, felt the change beneath the surface of skin. 

I'd *killed* that man after he'd opened up like a curio cabinet full of phalanges. It was curious that nobody had mentioned him despite me leaving his body behind the Eidelberg. It’s not like I’d even tried to clean up behind myself.

But this therapist was maybe telling me that that ol’ pendulum had finally begun swinging back this way and it was a matter of time before it got a second chance at me.

She gave me a thumb’s up.

I went inside One apartment, sure that no One would come. I was with my Little dog too, I made my self comfortable and started eating in the couch watching TV with my dog on my side.


WHAT I SEE LOOKING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW !!! THE OWNER OUTSIDE HIS CAR, HE SAW ME AND WAS SHOUTING AT ME. ""WTF ARE YOU DOING THERE INSIDE MY HOUSE ! GET THE FUCK OUT NOW!!! I would shout ""OKAY OKAY JUST LET ME GRAB MY THINGS IM GOING OUT"" and hearing him ""GO OUT NOOOOOOW!!!! IN THIS FUCKING MOMENT!! NOOOOOOWWW!!!!! YOU BETTER GO



It was really really scary. For whatever reasons he left with his multi milionarie car. But I didnt Watch TV again, I started packing my things in a hurry wanting tò go out the sooner possibile.


But.


A problem.


I made a mess of the house. Just for cooking something for my self before, the house was a mess. I had left crumbles everywhere, Sorry utensils and plates, pots. I started cleaning sooo fast. But... It never came tò an end. There was Always something new. HOURS passed with me cleaning, dreaming of finish everything and already feeling the sense of peace I would feel running down the street with my dog both safe. 



I was almost There, almost finished cleaning when... When I saw a car arriving, the Gates opening, It wasnt the same car, Always a multi milionarie car but different and the person inside It was still the OWNER of the apartment I was in, but he was different from before.


I was There, looking and hoping he wouldnt see me from that far. 


But for whatever reasons he saw some intruder was inside. He was at the phone and said ""oh, someone Is inside my apartment. Lets see Who It Is. It's Always happening more, to a lot of people here. I cant believe It, now lets see. 



I Just Remember the despair I felt as I Watch him getting close. Too late tò go out because I would not make It in time tò grab all my things without leaving trace. So I Just stood there waiting for my fate.....


I woke up feeling really scared. Only One hour passed since I fell asleep.



I ate a big peace of cake and coffee at night Just before going tò sleep. If that can made It worse




And I am changing my pleace where I live a lot. I dont have a Place tò call home and I absolutely relate on making the house a mess and then Always running up late cleaning everything when I have tò go, and Always carring my big heavy bags tò the car, in and out.

I liked the jungle trail because it seemed fun and there’s interesting additions (coffee park, biking, zip lining) and it was recommended by a friend. However, im worried about the mosquitos as I get bitten very badly and that we will miss some good views. 

Inca Jungle Trail: Less hiking, more variety (biking, zipline, jungle, hot springs), lower altitude, moderate difficulty.
Salkantay Trek: Harder trekking, higher altitude, mountain scenery, Humantay Lake, very challenging on Day 2.

Aug 3rd I started and jumped in the scale at 199.  Well that’s frustrating being down 10 lbs on day 0 before doing anything.   Literally had a large DQ blizzard the night before.   So now it’s September 15th.  I’m over a month in and I feel good.  I probably don’t eat enough beef and fat but I’m staying away from carbs for the most part.  I have enjoyed some small ice cream with my family and still occasionally have coffee creamer.  But even with these cheats I’m trying to stay under 20 carbs per day and increasing fat all the time.  Breakfast is always eggs and usually bacon too.  Lunch is typically left overs from the night before.  Dinner I try to eat the same thing as my family just not the carbs stuff.  Just the meat.  So this evening I jumped on the scale at 182.  30ish pounds from my average and 20 from my official start.  The weight is still slowing coming down.  Next I’m going to start adding some workouts.  Nothing crazy at first.  Just more walking and morning pushups and sit-ups and basic things like this.  I’ve never been a runner so I don’t see myself picking that up ever.  But I’m feeling good.  I’m down a full pant size and people have told me I look skinnier.  Still don’t love my body ( main reason why I’m doing this) but it’s getting better.

First, thank you once again. Your trust and belief in SPINN continue to fuel us, especially through the ups and downs of this journey. We know that waiting has not been easy. Some of you have chosen to withdraw your pre-orders, and we fully understand. To those who continue to stand with us, we are deeply grateful. We will not stop until SPINN2 is in your kitchen, delivering the coffee experience we promised and beyond.

Where We Are Today
The development of SPINN2 is in full swing. Over the past months we’ve had to make pivotal changes to our brewing system based on UL certification feedback. These adjustments were critical to ensure we pass both the UL certification and the FCC radio test. This has led to delays, but it has also pushed us to engineer a stronger, more reliable machine. New tools have been ordered, prototypes have been built and tested, and we are confident the next round of certification will deliver the results we need.

Building Smarter, Building Stronger
We’ve had to make some very tough decisions. Earlier this year, we closed the SPINN Lab in Amsterdam and consolidated our development efforts in Asia. Saying goodbye to valued colleagues was incredibly difficult, but as founders who have been building products in Shenzhen since 2005, we know from experience that this is the only place in the world where speed, cost, and access to the strongest supply chain come together. This step was necessary to build a stronger, faster R&D team positioned at the heart of the global ecosystem that makes high-precision, complex products like SPINN possible.

We are aware of the global commotion around the trade tensions between China and the United States. These tensions have placed SPINN in a very difficult position from both a fundraising and a business perspective. For investors, the constant uncertainty around import duties and rising taxes has created concerns that limited our ability to successfully raise capital. From a distribution point of view, it has made our proposition and business model far more complex to manage and nearly impossible to predict with confidence.

In recent months, we have been riding a rollercoaster, recalculating almost daily what kind of tariffs to anticipate, how to adapt our pricing, and how to optimize the cost of the coffee maker itself. This is the reality for many hardware companies manufacturing in China with the U.S. as their main, and sometimes only,  market: trade wars and shifting tariffs create immense pressure on planning, margins, and long-term strategy.

That said, having worked with highly specialized and deeply committed partners in China for nearly two decades, we are confident these tensions will not stop us from manufacturing advanced consumer electronics like SPINN. When it comes to producing complex, high-precision products at cost and at scale, there is still no alternative to Shenzhen. Consolidating our know-how and experience here is essential for the future of SPINN.

Our new setup now spans China and Indonesia, placing us in the center of the world’s most powerful manufacturing ecosystem. Here, surrounded by factories, vendors, and distribution networks, we have everything we need to create high-complexity, high-precision products at the quality and cost required. From product development to sourcing, testing, and endurance trials, our Asia-based team is now fully focused on bringing SPINN2 to life.
 
Perfecting the Coffee Cake
One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring a consistent coffee cake inside the brew unit. This step is absolutely critical for achieving reliable extraction and yield. In early tests, we discovered that the cake would occasionally deform during formation, leading to inconsistent results.

To address this, we carefully analyzed the system and redesigned several of the key CNC and die-cast parts, improving grinding precision and stabilizing cake formation before brewing begins. In parallel, we introduced hardware changes to the brew unit itself and developed new tools to reinforce overall performance.

With these updates and fine-tuned parameters, we now consistently achieve the right TDS and yield levels across all brew types, from ristretto and espresso to coffee and cold brew. All of these efforts have been driven by one clear goal: creating a coffee maker that is consistent, delivers uncompromising quality, and does so in a convenient and fast way.
 
Why This Matters
SPINN has always been about more than a coffee maker. It’s about reinventing the way coffee can be brewed: fresh beans, no waste, no pods, better taste, and a hassle-free connected experience. SPINN2 is the culmination of years of learning, rebuilding, and refining. We believe that once it launches, it will set a new standard in home coffee.
 
The Road Ahead
We continue to work relentlessly on securing the right capital to not only launch SPINN2, but also to scale it into retail in the U.S. and beyond. Over the past months, this has been one of our biggest challenges. Raising capital for hardware startups has always been tough, but in today’s climate, with trade wars, rising tariffs, and global uncertainty, it has become even more difficult. Investors are cautious, timelines stretch longer, and sometimes we’ve been unable to secure the necessary funds at the exact moments we needed them. This has contributed to delays, put stress on the team, but it has never stopped our determination.

What keeps us going is that we feel we are not alone in this. Our community and dear customers remain with us, and we are actively working with a potential new investor and partner, Steven. Steven is not only one of our biggest customers, owning 16 SPINN V1 machines, but also a true partner who is helping us rebuild the company. He is supporting us in restructuring the organization, strengthening operations, and preparing for an international rollout. The process has been turbulent, but with Steven’s involvement, alongside every discussion, every adjustment, and every step forward, we are building a stronger foundation for a sustainable future.
 
Launch date
We know many of you are eager for a firm launch date. Right now, we can’t responsibly commit to one. What we can promise is that every day we are fighting to bring SPINN2 closer to your kitchen, and every decision we make is about ensuring the quality, reliability, and experience you deserve. Your patience and continued belief mean the world to us, it is the reason we can keep pushing forward.
 
Why We Won’t Stop
We are the biggest users of SPINN ourselves. Every morning at home, throughout the day in the office, and even in the evenings when camping or at family gatherings, SPINN is part of our daily lives. We’ve carried our machines in suitcases across the world to share with people outside the United States what makes SPINN so unique. And every time, the reaction is the same, the taste of SPINN coffee is something truly special: smooth, velvety, and unlike anything from a standard fully automatic coffee maker.

That’s what drives us. Because when we imagine a world without SPINN, all that remains are the generic flavors from conventional machines that simply can’t deliver the quality of a true SPINN brew. There is no other coffee maker in the market that can prepare a single-serve espresso, 20 oz of drip, or a cold brew at the push of a single button. What we built with the original SPINN V1 was already a kingmaker, and with SPINN2 we’re determined to raise the bar even higher.

It all comes down to flavor, the distinctive, unique SPINN taste that no other coffee maker in the world can replicate. This is why, despite the challenges, we keep pushing forward. Our passion for this product and for the community around it drives us every day. We believe that once SPINN2 is in your kitchens, the experience and the community will only grow stronger.
 
A Heartfelt Thank You
We want you to know how much we value this community and how deeply we appreciate your patience and support. We would love to keep you as excited as we are, even though communication can sometimes be challenging. The truth is, we are sailing through one of the most uncertain and critical phases in SPINN’s existence. Every update we send out must be carefully considered, because we can’t afford to keep shifting our communication while we’re in the middle of such an important fundraising phase, restructuring our organization, moving offices, and reallocating resources to strengthen our team.

At times it may feel quiet, but behind the scenes we are working harder than ever, driven not only by our passion for this product, but also by you, our community and dear customers. The positive reactions and words of encouragement we receive from you on a daily basis keep us moving forward. For that, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

We also understand that many of our SPINN2 pre-order backers feel they cannot wait much longer. We hear you. But we promise this: if you stick with us, you will be at the very core of SPINN’s future, part of a group, a team, a community that is shaping a new way to experience coffee. And we believe that even those who choose to step away today will return once SPINN2 is in the market, because once you taste SPINN, you never want to go back.

There is no other fully automatic coffee maker that can do what SPINN does. We see SPINN not just as a product, but as a kingmaker, a technology that defines how people will experience coffee at home for years to come.

Thank you for your belief, your patience, and your faith. The vision that started this journey is still alive, and with every iteration SPINN2 is becoming not only what we promised, but something even better. Together, we will make it happen.
 
With gratitude,
Roderick, Serge and the SPINN Team

I’m typically the one waiting, but my date was already there. “Oh nice, he likes to be prepared like me.” Then I glance at the coffee in his hand, and it’s already half empty. “Oh, so he arrived at least 30 minutes early and didn’t say anything?” It takes time to line up and receive your order. He could’ve texted before he came that he’d be early. 

AIO or was it rude of him to already have finished most of his coffee before I even placed my order? Did he do this just to avoid paying for my coffee, instead of just telling me he’d like to go Dutch? Whenever I meet with friends, we always wait for the other parties to arrive before ordering, unless someone says they’ll be very late and to just go ahead.

Bonus points if you can compare Philly neighborhoods to Boston. We currently live in Northern Liberties, which is essentially center city Philly.

I am trying this again…
Hey i am Kareem! Nice to meet you!I am 23 year looking for a women, ideally we would chat on here for a while and see if we can establish a connection or if we seem to trust each other maybe switch to another app? I will follow your pace and lead with how comfortable you are. A little about me, i am actually North African , but lived my entire life in the middle east, I am chubby, 5’9, brown eyes and hair, i like watching movies, car rides, very and reserved (often seen as non-chalanat but definitely not the case), always respectful due to customs/culture taught me so and playing video games and i love cuddling! I really love anime and can geek out about for hours, my favorite is AOT followed by Naruto (one piece enjoyers are not welcome lol), i like fantasy stuff as well so Game of thrones, House of dragons or Vikings are also another thing i love. For video games i am kinda of in slump especially trying to balance work, gym and family, but i mainly play league of legends, mainly play support but will try to learn a new role soon, hit me if you even just want to play! I love deep talks especially about life and i am very open minded and can always try to and will probably relate to your situation. I do come with some emotional baggage not from relationships but just life in general and i am working on it in therapy. Ideally you would be Minnesota or somewhere close by cause i would love to meet someday for coffee, walk or maybe even a cute date if we get that far lol. If any of this resonated with you feel free to message me! I am located near zumbrota. Looking forward to hearing from you!

Please don’t message me if you are going to send one boring message and disappear, all i ask is to have some common courtesy since it’s a two way street. Even if you are letting me know if you don’t enjoy the conversation 

Have a nice day!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: NC Dinos vs. SSG Landers (KBO, 2025-09-16)**  
*“Baseball, but make it a high-stakes game of ‘Guess Which Team Has the Better Coffee Order’”*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Might Spread 1.5 Runs)

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The **SSG Landers** are the favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering between **1.77 and 1.85** (implied probability: \~54-57%). The **NC Dinos**, meanwhile, are priced at **1.8–2.05** (implied \~49-55%), giving you a +1.5-run spread at **1.53–1.62** (Dinos) and -1.5 for the Landers at **2.28–2.45**. The total runs line sits at **8.0**, with the **Under** priced slightly better (1.83–1.93) than the Over (1.81–1.91).

Here’s the breakdown:

* **Landers -1.5** (implied 69-70% chance to cover): They’re the clear favorites, but that spread feels like a “half-bagel” in a bakery—just enough to make the underdog’s life harder.
* **Under 8.0 Runs** (implied 52-53% chance): With both teams’ pitching staffs seemingly preoccupied with avoiding the KBO version of “Groundball Roulette,” the Under feels like a bet on “Let’s Not Swing at 80% of Pitches.”

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Roster Moves, and Why the Dinos Are “Bring a Bat, Bring a Prayer”

No recent news? No problem. Let’s extrapolate from the odds like a sportswriter with a sixth sense:

* **SSG Landers**: Their pitching staff must be channeling the ghost of Mariano Rivera, given their ability to consistently shut teams out. Or maybe they just hired a statistician to fake ERA numbers. Either way, their -1.5 spread screams “we’re not losing this one unless the game is played in a hurricane.”
* **NC Dinos**: The +1.5 spread and 2.05 moneyline suggest they’re the “David” of this matchup. Are they injured? Possibly. Are they relying on a rookie phenom who’s 60
