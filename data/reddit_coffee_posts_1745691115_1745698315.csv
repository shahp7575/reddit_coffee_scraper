first find the agencies using clutch you can search for digital marketing seo branding ppc email marketing any type of agency you want

then place an order inside scrapeamax tell them you want for example digital marketing agencies first two pages or you can say scrape all pages for unlimited data.  


once you get the list you will have company names and domains ready.

then import the csv into clay create a new workbook import the file replace spreadsheet

inside clay use the find people at these companies function make sure you map the domain correctly otherwise it will not find the right people.

include job levels like owner partner ceo vp director manager senior you can even filter by location like united states.

after that run the enrichment and you will get the list of people working inside those agencies

now for emails you can run enrichment and search find work email, u can use credits (which i dont recommend at all) or api or even run waterfall enrichment.  


also make sure you turn on mark only safe to send emails meaning only valid emails not catchalls so you keep your bounce rate below 1%  


this way you can scrape agencies find people get verified emails all without paying crazy monthly fees.  


been using this for 3 months and it works smooth if you want the link to scrapeamax or have questions happy to help",1,1745697949.0,coldemail,0,1.0,False

Anyways on the way there was a cemetery the area was really creepy tbhü´£ When I got there he looked nothing like his photos! (obviously it wasn‚Äôt who they said they were) The man who I thought was meeting in the photos was more heavy set and older and white male and the man that showed up looked latino and very skinny and not as old as the other man in his photos. Completely different face anyways before I saw him I was waiting for him and sat right in front of the starbucks He told me he had a white tesla? I called him because I didn‚Äôt see him (the whole time while I was I sitting in front of the starbucks) and then he picked up sounding kinda weird and then I told him what color outfit I had on he was saying he couldn‚Äôt find me. Because I don‚Äôt know him yet of course and he doesn‚Äôt know me well yet. It turns out he parked right in front of the starbucks He got out of a completely different car a white Nissan He told me he was looking for an arrangement and said I was beautiful and giving me compliments then he got up (all while i was sitting down keep in mind) I got a closer look at what he was wearing when he walked up to the table I was sitting at he was wearing very old basketball shorts a hat and a old looking tee shirt (keep in mind I just got a good look at his clothes and this is not what SD i‚Äôve ever been like dressed like or even the way he carried him self) then he walks over towards his car making hand motions telling me to get in his the car that my money for the gas was in‚Äôs there then I told him i‚Äôm not getting in his car and that I don‚Äôt know him yet I thought we were gonna get coffee and get to know each other?

Also keep in mind this man on his profile was claiming he had a lot of money was willing to spoil which is obviously not true and I could tell he wasn‚Äôt a real POT he was just a creep so I just got up walked away!! left the starbucks  and went into a grocery store with lots of people in it that was near by and ordered my uber in there and left So after he says all this stuff I got extremely disgusted by him and everything he said is untrue I did pageants as a child teenager and do modeling now.

Later I ordered my favourite coffee after finishing the Alfredo. The coffee somehow made me recall more of the moments about my trip. I didn't left the cafe until I was done writing.

So I do want to say he's white and gay and a republican (he has a maga sticker on his coffee mug), not that I have an issue with that (well, 2 of 3 I have no issue with), but it is actually relevant.

He was hired after the previous principle got promoted and the first week of this year he came through the office and I was with the testing coordinator about proctoring because she's the type who wants it all coordinating well in advance. He came over and just snapped immediately that he needed us to wait until it got closer because ""I need to approve the short list for proctoring"" and left.

During our leadership meetings he make constant remarks towards male admin to the point our para had to tell him if he said any of that towards her he'd be arrested for sexual harassment that same hour. When he started to get snippy with everyone who was friends with our para, I called him out during a leadership meeting and he said ""well I'm the principle so you can't talk to me like that, babe."" So I wrote a letter to my superintendent. Well now we're ""restructuring"" for next year and he's saying I have to ""reinterview"" because he ""isn't sure I have the skills"" for my job (that I've been doing for almost ten years and have a master's degree). Meanwhile he's replacing me with someone who has never done the job and only been a teacher for a year. No interview for *them* of course (and yes, they are a traditionally attractive gay man too, and yes I am implying unethical behavior).

Also, every role he's ""replacing"" and making reinterview are all PoC, mostly women and are all being replaced by white predominantly male staff. And again, I ***am absolutely*** implying unethical behavior.

I‚Äôm currently making water via a zero water filter and lotus drops. Have been using the bright and juicy recipe, but also have explored the others on their site. The vast majority of my brews are still far from where I want them to be. 

I‚Äôm using an ode gen 2 with ssp mp burrs, calibrated one click past chirp and grinding at 7 and going as low as 5 to try to dial in. V60 with both cafec abaca and sibarist b3 hybrid filters depending on what mood I‚Äôm in. 

It seems like every brew is a bit vegetal and lacking the acidity I like. But if I go finer to try to extract more, I instantly get into astringency issues. Have been moving between 1:15 and 1:16.5 attempting to rectify as well. And yes, only changing one variable at a time. 

Truly the only variable I can think that could be off is my water.

1k8ldj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k8ldj6/should_you_buy_peg_perego_ypsi_travel_system/,Should You Buy Peg Perego Ypsi Travel System Review for Ultimate Baby Comfort?,"I recently had the chance to get my hands on the Peg Perego IPMS26US00SO13 Ypsi Travel System: a sleek, Italian-made stroller and infant car seat combo designed to simplify the life of busy parents. For context, I‚Äôm the parent of a very active toddler and an infant, so finding gear that balances durability, comfort, and versatility is a big deal. Using this travel system daily gave me real insights‚Äîboth good and not-so-good‚Äîabout what it offers.

**Design That Catches the Eye**

The design of this travel system is truly something to appreciate. Its modern, dynamic aesthetic isn‚Äôt just a visual treat‚Äîit‚Äôs also highly functional in cramped or crowded environments. Navigation through narrow aisles at the grocery store felt effortless, which is likely thanks to the sturdy 4-wheel setup and compact frame. The fact that it's finished in onyx with eco-leather details on the hand-sewn handlebar adds a touch of elegance. While I usually don‚Äôt care much for style in baby gear as long as it works, this combo felt genuinely premium every time I took it out.

**Effortless Baby Transport**

One of the best things about this travel system is how seamlessly the Primo Viaggio 4-35 Nido Infant Car Seat docks onto the stroller chassis. The one-time link system eliminates the frustration of fiddling with complex attachments‚Äîbonus points when I‚Äôm trying to juggle a diaper bag, coffee, and an increasingly wriggly infant. Removing and reattaching the car seat became second nature after just a few tries. The car seat itself is rear-facing‚Äîadjustable to support babies from as small as 4 pounds up to 35 pounds‚Äîand has an impressive dual-stage cushion system. My newborn seemed snug and supported, which gave me peace of mind on both short and long drives.

**[Find the best price for Peg Perego IPMS26US00SO13 on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07kd7wp74/)**

**Versatility: One System, Multiple Modes**

Versatility might be its strongest feature. While primarily configured as a single stroller, this system allows for a second seat to be added with optional adapters, which I foresee being hugely beneficial as my kids grow. The reversible, detachable stroller seat was game-changing during a trip to the park. Facing my baby towards me kept her calm and engaged, while flipping her outward let her soak in the surroundings. Both the foldable design and telescoping handle height adjustments saved me from countless inconveniences. At just 22.6 pounds for the stroller seat and about 20 pounds for the frame, folding and carrying it was easier than other bulkier strollers.

**Pros**

- Reversible and foldable seat adds versatility.  
- One-time link system simplifies car seat attachment.  
- Telescoping handle accommodates different user heights.  
- Compact build aids maneuverability in crowded spaces.  
- Premium materials and finish create a luxury feel.  

**Safety Features That Stand Out**

Safety is always at the forefront of any parent's mind, and the features in this travel system are a testament to thoughtful engineering. Its infant car seat boasts an innovative Load Leg base and Anti-Rebound Bar, both of which significantly reduce movement during a collision. It‚Äôs comforting to know these features make a big difference in safety, even though we all hope never to need them. Additionally, the five-point harness felt secure yet easy to strap in, which adds convenience to its already robust safety package.

**Areas for Improvement**

No product is perfect, and the Peg Perego Ypsi Travel System was no exception.  

- The system didn‚Äôt come with the double adapters or companion seat needed for doubling it, which means they need to be purchased separately.  
- The undercarriage basket seemed spacious but didn‚Äôt always hold bulkier items well.  
- Tire materials (rubber or plastic mix) felt less capable on uneven terrain.  

**Competing Brands**

During my search, I also tried a couple of competing travel systems. Chicco Bravo Trio, for instance, offered an equally impressive infant car seat but lacked the sleek, modern aesthetics and adaptability of this system. Uppababy‚Äôs Vista performed well in terms of versatility as it too accommodates growing families, but its price point is significantly higher. Comparing features, the Peg Perego Ypsi holds its own with its Italian craftsmanship, practicality, and thoughtful design.

**Affordable Quality**

I‚Äôd describe the price-to-quality ratio of this travel system as competitive. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, but every aspect of its design feels like a well-justified investment in safety, durability, and ease of use. You‚Äôre paying for premium materials and functional features‚Äîlike the reversible seating, innovative car seat cushion system, and thoughtful safety measures. In the long run, the flexibility to expand with double adapters adds even more value.

our store has two-seater high tables, a long table for groups, lounge chairs, and outdoor seating. these new stores will all be to-go places. no seating area indoor or outdoor, tiny lobby. just the register. espresso machine, and drip coffee in the front, kitchen in the back.

which sucks for everyone. customers want to sit and eat their breakfast somewhere other than their car, lines out the door will become lines down the sidewalk + a super crowded tiny little lobby. because the store is smaller less people will be hired which will make service worse as we'll be spread super thin.

My family and I like the versatility, convenience and all the available cup sizes. Went on vacation, stayed on a hotel that had an OL Essenza, but charged an outrageous 2.5 USD per pod. Naturally, I said fuck that and bought myself some Starbucks branded OL pods and tried them out, plus just the one pod from the hotel's selection. I was impressed by the flavor and the size of the machine, so much so that I just had to buy myself one of these little ones to accompany my Vertuo Next.

Perhaps I should have gone to my boutique to slowly taste the different OL pods on offer, but I jumped the shark and bought the pods that sounded interesting and/or to my liking using u/alvinbunk 's spreadsheet and reading on the various taste notes and reviews, when available.

The pods I bought are: Nicaragua, Shanghai Lungo, Kahawa ya Congo, Istanbul Espresso, Barista Creations Nocciola, Arpeggio and Indonesia. Really excited to try them out, might even set up a cupping. If anybody has any experiences, good or bad, with any of these pods, I'd love to hear them. Or hell, even recommendations for down the line.

1k8l6sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1k8l6sp/27_m4f_just_like_mom_and_dad/,27 [M4F] Just like Mom and Dad,"This is definitely a repost but the intro accurately describe what I've been craving in a rs. This is a pretty long post.

I wouldn't have known about true love if it wasn't for my parents. How come it's so hard to find that other half of myself. I never had a long list of exs, and only a small circle of friends. I've always seen the both of them just laughing their hearts out with the spirit of lovers from their teen years at their late 40s. The sweetest kissed that mom ever gave to dad everytime he came home. The tightest embrace that dad gave when they're out on the boulevard for a walk. And the jolliest karaoke in which they both sing their hearts out to relieve their stresses. ""I never imagined that your dad gave me wings to soar beyond my wildest life, the other half that completes me"" - Mom


All I ever ask for is my version of Mom & Dad's love. It manifested to my elder brother how come mine still hasn't arrive lmao. Someone I can take on a spontenous date. Someone I can talk to for hours about random stuff. Someone who is willing get to know each other deeply. Someone who can show me the best version of herself. Someone who is able to withstand my voice in karaoke lmao. I am also a christian

About me:

- 27

- 168cm

- Home province is Mindanao atm I am in Taguig

- Normal BMI haven't gone to the gym lately but I've been doing home cardio for strength training

- No vices but I do drink alak occasionally or socially with my workmates but the catch ay dapat may karaoke. Clubs ain't for me but karaoke is perfect (don't make me hold the mic!)

- Finances. The career path I took can secure the finances and be stable independently but still not satisfied kaya I'm juggling both my career and business plans in the province alternately during vacation. Not there yet but closer than yesterday.

- LDR. I love my job as I work on a floating piece of metal on the ocean. Besides it pays well and gives room for investments.

- Emotionally Stable. We can be accountability buddy for each other. I know there are things left unsaid but I want to connect wholefully with you kase ganun yung parents ko and my elder brother with his wife. To genuinely connect with each other.

- Family Oriented. Closely knitted family. It doesn't apply to my titas, titos and grandparents kase qng gulo sa mga matanda hahaha. But in our generation sa mga pinsan we're all close - knit. From giving advices and showing the pro and con to a very magulo decision. I got a very small circle of friends and majority of which ay pinsan ko lang. I'm happy kase yung mga pinsan ko would trust us (kami ni kuya) mag bigay ng advice during their mid life crisis especially transitioning from studies to adulting.

- Hobbies. Marksmanship for guns. Manga and manhua. Cooking (YT is the best teacher pag wala si mom). Loves history specifically warfare. Coffee. Outdoors im nature

About you:

- Not beyond 30

- Capable for LDR. Ghorl yung work ko wala sa lupa

- As long as youre taking steps to improve your health. A daily exercise routine lowers anxiety which is why I would recommend doing it. 

- Emotionally Ready for a Commitment. Stop hitting up on me if ayaw mo mag commit and hindi pa ready sa relasyon. I'm not an open book for everyone to read. I want to be exclusive for my partner only.

- Finances. Mahirap yung financial security sa liit ng sahod sa Pinas but I do hope na alam mo mag manage ng finances mo at hindi lang panay gala and de stress kase sis we're not getting younger.

- Goal - Oriented. Sana may pangarap ka din sa buhay. Major turn off yung napapagod na ako gusto ko nalang maging housewife. Buti pa maging patatas ka kesa maging housewife.

- Know what they want. I want to know your career path and how you see yourself at the age of 30. Kase I've already figured out mine and there are set backs but I'm definitely progressing.

- Family - Oriented. Not all parents are good and even their own siblings but I do hope na nag strive ka for a good family environment kase gusto ko kagaya sa parents ko yung love and affection that they have for each other even when theyre both old na.

- Thoughts of having a Child. Honestly speaking, having a child right now would completely derail all my plans lmao. I still havent closed my thoughts to be childless for life sana ikaw din. Somewhere in between na mag decide tayo in the near future for it. It's your body and painful yung child birth and somethings wouldnt be the same sa katawan mo kaya I totally respect your decision but dont make that decision just yet lmao.

I posted here last October and got bombarded sa messages. I have a very low social battery kaya I want to be exclusively available for one person only. You can hit me up again since tapos na yung ka talking stage ko verbal din kami to stop. There were no physical dates virtual lang lahat but lasted for awhile *insert its something meme*.  Dates during adulting phase is seeing na kaya mo mag compromise for another person.

Again, I am not an open book for everyone to read. I'm not looking for a friend and want to keep my circle small. I'm here for awhile so we got a whole lot of time to get to know each other virtually bago the physical date. Ask for my picture and see if we fit with our own perspective of beauty. I would appreciate you a whole lot pag yung intention mo ay date to marry po

Later I ordered my favourite coffee after finishing the Alfredo. The coffee somehow made me recall more of the moments about my trip. I didn't left the cafe until I was done writing. This was the longest that I stayed in a Caf√©. The vibe was really great. People would come and go without crowding the place.

So, with the money that my dad had, he wanted to replace my car and I asked if he didn't even wanted to ask for my opinion, since it's my 1st ever car. He said he didn't cared about my opinion because I wouldn't wanted to replace it anyway. We discussed how he doesn't even want to understand my feelings and how that broke me inside. In the afternoon I cried during work about how my family doesn't treat me right. I sended audios to my friend (let's call him Andrew (32M) and he responded with things to support me and saying how my parents don't take my feelings into consideration and that should be the most important here. My parents found those messages (only the writtens from Andrew) and they started hating him, saying that my friend is a bad company and he wants to destroy my family connections. In that response, I asked them if they even heard my audio of 7 minutes breaking down at work because of them, they ignored the audio and don't want to see the full picture. If this all came from my mother, I would feel bad, but ok, we don't get along. My father was the one that broke me. I felt disrespected and heart broken because I trusted him, we did get along pretty well. Just the thought of it hurts me inside.

In the meanwhile, my brother started dating a girl (14F) that lives in a institution, he was at the time 17 and they had their fights and broke and got back together a few times. I told him that this girl wasn't a future for him if they were always breaking up. So the decision my brother made, having a child with this girl just a week before turning 18. It was a shock for everyone at my house. He wanted to take her out of the institution, so they thought that having a child would do that. Me and my father denied it, my mother loved it, she wants more grandkids and I feel she doesn't like me because I told her I'm never gonna give her grandchildren, just not interested in nothing romantic. So he is a 18 year boy with 1 year still of obligatory school and who's gonna take responsabilities for the kid that will be born in a few months, since both parents still have school? I think I'm the only sane guy in the family to think how this has more problems attached to it, like the girl still hasn't left the institution, the child will be born in there, my brother went to court so she could leave, that failed. Now they're accusing the judge of lying (which that still baffles my mind).

During this pregnancy, my parents opened a coffee shop so my mother could have a work and get out of the house, so me and my brother stayed at home when we could after class and work to clean the house. I wash the dishes, put clothes on washer and drier machines and iron them and cleaning the house. My brother only sometimes cleaned the dust or swiped the floor, most rarely both at the same weekend. We argued over he not helping enough with the chores and I'm feeling like a slave in this house and he should have more responsability since he's going to be a father and the house chores must be done by us, since our parents leave the house in the morning and arrive late at night everyday. My mother was there seated watching all this happen and my brother, all frustrated, asked me to let him go to his room to calm down, I didn't let him because I haven't finished talking, so he reached me and put his fist on my face, saying if I don't let him go, he would punch me for real. I was in shock, my brother, a child I watched grow and never did nothing bad to him, only want the best for him, and here he threatened me. I looked to my mother, my eyes pleading for help, she did nothing. I had to let him go, after that I asked my mother why she didn't did nothing. She said she was in shock, but it was my fault. After almost being punched hearing my mother not wanting to support me at this time of need, it broke me inside even more.  
  
So I decided to leave the house with my friend Andrew and start a life for both of us to divide a house. When I told my parents that I would move out, they said I was being stupid and manipulated because my friend wanted to ruin my life and my money (which they didn't gave me all of it, only about 12 thousand, saying the rest I won't get because my brother needs it more for the newborn daughter) but after that, they begged me to stay and promised things would change and my brother promised to help more around the house. Me, wanting to believe in a change of heart in them, I naively accepted and how wrong I was. Nothing changed, it even got worse. After 3 weeks of not helping, I told my brother that there would be no more drives to the school until he started cleaning again (house to school its 5 minute walk, but he is too lazy), he yelled at me saying ""I DON'T WANT NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THIS GUY!"" and we didn't talked to for 3 months and went to school everyday on Uber instead of apologizing for what he had said. On the 1st month, my parents talked to me, that I should forget about that, in due to family being good again. I refused because my honor and my self-respect was being thrown out the window. He disrespects me after failing a promise and I'm the one that should say sorry? I said no, I wouldn't do that, my parents called me idiot for ruining this family.

I started to feel bad about all this. Am I doing anything wrong? Am I in the wrong here? I talked about this with my friends and they all support me and my decisions until now because what I'm doing is thinking about myself and what's right for me. Right now, I'm gonna move out with my friend and his girlfriend. The overall plan is for her to get a house for her, a few months later he goes to live with her and I have the rented house for myself. Haven't told my parents yet, but I know as soon as I tell them that, hell will break loose, specially since I'm moving out to a village that it's 30 minutes drive from where I currently live so for my mother (that praises family over anything) will say that I'm breaking the family apart and they are counting on me to help them with my new sister-in-law and raising my nephew (which I will love my nephew as I do with my other 3 from my older brother, however I'm not the father, I shouldn't be the one to give him all the necessities he needs, like diapers, food, doctors apoitments, etc...). I'm thinking about telling them when I get the keys of the house so I can show them it's really it this time. I'm done, I'm mentally exhausted and I need space, freedom and peace of mind in my life and here in the household I grew, I don't feel that at all. It's sad that I'm getting out of the family I grew up with, but I'm gonna be with the family I choose which are more understandable, reasoning and know to respect me, and I don't know how much I can pay them for helping me so much in my times of need, because I know, if I was alone during all this, I don't think I would be brave to went through all this and had given up and hated the person I was becoming, like a jailed bird not knowing how to open it's door, and my friends just raised my cage door so I could fly away from all these problems.

Am I the asshole in this whole situation? What should I do more to help me get prepared for the innevitable discussion?",2,1745695630.0,AITAH,1,0.75,False

Not here for hookups. Honestly just looking for conversations because life sometimes feels like a really long elevator ride where the music sucks. Bored? Same. Lonely sometimes? Also same.

I'm a night owl by nature, sleep? Yeah, not really my thing. Wish it were. Turns out I was born with an overthinking, overlapping, overblabbing mind that decided sleep was optional. So if you're also someone who‚Äôs awake at questionable hours wondering about the universe or regretting life decisions, we might get along.

If you like Star Wars, Tolkien (LOTR, Hobbit, Silmarillion, the whole beautifully complicated mess), Marvel, pop culture, or just knowing what's going on in the world without sounding like a conspiracy theorist ‚Äî we‚Äôll probably click. Bonus points if you read books¬†*and*¬†actually finish them (tell me what the last thing you read was, unless it was the back of a cereal box... I‚Äôm not judging... much).

Movies? LOTR (again), some Marvel (again), Ocean‚Äôs series, Dumb and Dumber, Ad Astra, Interstellar (*basically a poem*), The Godfather, Inception, The Prestige, Django, The Shawshank Redemption, The Dark Knight, Schindler‚Äôs List, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Star Wars (obviously), The Matrix, Gladiator, Whiplash, Alita, Alien... and the list goes on because commitment issues when choosing favorites.

People say I‚Äôm funny, sarcasm included free of charge. I enjoy dark humor, occasional seriousness, and strategic bursts of foul language. (It's called balance.)

Introvert when necessary. Extrovert when coffee kicks in. Raised Catholic, currently just vibing.

Music taste? Chaos. Think: The Cure, Metallica, Ed Sheeran, Silent Sanctuary, Bj√∂rk, Toto, Epica, Chainsmokers, and somehow still managing to squeeze in opera and classical without my brain exploding. Basically, if it sounds good, I‚Äôm in.

If you like talking about history, philosophy, quantum physics, or wild theories about the universe, we‚Äôll probably get along weirdly well.

Oh, and I speak Spanish (native), English (obviously), and enough Tagalog to survive but not enough to debate with your lola.

Anyway, if you‚Äôre also looking for conversations with¬†*actual substance*¬†(or at least some entertaining nonsense with a sprinkle of existential dread), hit me up. No pressure. Maybe a bit weirdness (well, not¬†*too*¬†much). Who knows, maybe we‚Äôll meet one day. Maybe not. Life‚Äôs weird like that.",1,1745695602.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

Thank you CJ for all your hard work 
Hi im bunny but also go by tea and im writing a horror series based on strange encounters please enjoy - bunny 


Hello welcome to the institution of the unexplainable, also known as IOU we studie the unusual and strange encounters one might have and try to contasept them. I'm the head of the logs, this means I have to go through and read archives and cases that get dismissed due to the lack of evidence or questionable sources.

On today's log we will talk about a strange encounter with a house that seems to end in a misunderstanding and a mysterious place of events. 

Name: Chole Sharp 
Age: 25
date of incident: april 29 2015 
Log. 105 : holes in the windows 
Start of Recording:

It all started the day I moved into Willy, it was my great grandma's old house that she left me once she passed, It always seemed strange. When I would go there as a little one it felt almost as if there was always another thing in the house like it was alive in self. It was a small creepy house with 2 floors.

 The downstairs with a kitchen, bathroom, a guest and living room but there was also this dank small crawl space where she would put all of her nicknacks and old knitted blankets. It was moist and musty, the white paint now cream and peeling, revealing the brown rotten wood that always looked slightly wet.

 The worst part was how to get out. See you had to crawl through a dark muggy tunnel that smells like molding out grime. But this house it also had its up, like the upstairs where my great grandma's room was along with the other bathroom there was an array of beautiful colored glass painted windows, they were alluring almost like they called to you and the way they were so detailed and perfect with every stroke and the changes of magnificent colors it was so heavenly like the gods themselves had put all their affection and travels into them. I think that's what made me stay and for the fact it was a free place to stay. 

  I also decided to stay in my great grandma's room. It had the same glass windows but this time there was a small chip in the corner of the window. It was on the lower left side but there were no cracks around it, just a hole. Once I saw it was implemented into my mind almost like a bug that will never leave you alone, that buzzes around and around your head till the noise gets too loud and with a smash there goes the loud sly bug that once thought it was so great is now dead. 
In that moment I saw a very dark shadow surry through my peripheral vision. It was quick and disappeared in the blink of an eye with the turn of my head. When a small herd of flies began to form at the edge of the hole then all the noise began to grow again. So furthermore I was gonna smash it but I couldn't because it would break all the elegance around where hole was not, so to fix my problem I put some duct tape on the hole along with a fake flower plant placed right where the devilish hole was. Then I ignored it or at least I tried to. At first just not paying much mind to it and that was going just fine. But then I started to see things, at least I think like the duct tape had a cut in it like long  claw marks and no matter how much I tried to re-tape it the gapping tear would just reappear but bigger and bigger and I swear there were eyes watching me through the tears. 

I just thought it's all in my head and I just tried to settle into my new life starting with looking for a new part time job. So I could at least be busy with something. I also wanted a reason to get out of this god forsaken house and its overbearing feelings. I was also starting to feel lonely and frustrated, my mom and dad died in a car crash so my grandmother raised me from when I was 5 and I mean I already felt like a failure and have low self confidence. I really wanted to prove that I can live on my own. But that's just me rambling, I'll get back to my story. I think it's hard to really tell when I began to change or even realize it was so fast but slow, almost like if I had made days last months and months last years I would see and hear things, lights would flicker and bumps in the night.

 There was even a time where I swore I saw a large creature standing in my doorway. I wanted to cry so bad but once I met eyes with it, it slowly brought up it's dark hand up to it mouth and shhhhed me while closing my door. The morning after I was just sitting there drinking my coffee trying to wrap my head around what was going on when I heard the buzzing noise. At first it sounded like maybe one or two I wonder where it could have came from but the more I looked the more I began to feel ill and then it being to feel like a mass that of a millions and the Begrudging sound of the buzzing begin filing my head, swarming as to almost make me dizzy. That's when it went silent then as if I didn‚Äôt control my body, I started to almost float up the creaky stairs and straight to the room with the hole in the window. 

It was still the same colorful glass and was now lit up by the rising sun and you could feel the warmth. That's when the buzz sound came back making my head shoot immediately to the plant that had been put up to hide that forsaken hole and to which I walked up to that disgusting aggravating model of pottery and picked it up to see there was nothing there but the buzzing still continued and it just got louder like a sonic boom that is being created inside your brain. Like nothing could stop it and that‚Äôs when I shattered the disgusting creation of the dry painted clay. And slowly, very slowly, almost as if I had learned a new subject and was looking over all the new curiosity that I have gained about the subject, like an owl watching the mice scurry along the cold ground at night. I watched the maggots crawl out the nasty pot they wormed around screaming out along with an eyeball.It rolled on my wood floors straight to me. I put my foot under it and made a small squash sound as I stepped on it, slightly squeezing out some blood along with the veins to which fall on the floor with a layer look.

 I took a deep breath and I kneel down to picked up some of the maggots then I began to feast on them, I scarf them down like last night's dinner, I ate them like I was dying, like I had never eaten anything in my life, I ate and I ate and I ate until nothing was there it feels like gushers in my mouth with all the gougy inside it was warm. And that‚Äôs when It had finally stopped all the buzzing. It had finally gone, this was really the end of it. And for the first time in all the short time I have been here I felt at peace. At that moment I just felt a flood of emotions. I began to cry and with that sadness came anger with anger came sickness and with sickness came falling asleep on my toilet all my vomiting attempts unachieved.

 But that's not even the worst part. I found out when I woke up that morning everything was in its place, the pot still in its spot, the mess all cleaned up, the only difference was the hole it was gone and in its place was dark black glass. It's different from the beautiful aray the actual glass around it. I tried to touch it but once my hand even just lightly grazed it, it all began to crack and shatter then there was the buzzing again followed by a ear-piercing shriek and that's when my nose began to bleed and I swear the house began to shake. I quickly ran down stairs to find out the blaring noise along with what was causing all the convuling house and I tried to get to the front door but when I tried to turn the knobe I was met with resistance. It was locked. 

To what next led me to the crawl space and its deep black tounel that I so idiotically crawled through. But this time it felt more cramped and the walls seemed more as if they were breathing. There were little droplets falling on my hands as I moved. They were cold and slimy. But when I got to the opening I began to see small white lights in my dissent, the same light I saw in my doorway. But I just couldn‚Äôt see and I turned on the light. It was one of those pull lights and I just didn't know but after that click that's when I finally saw willy. A skinny slimy tall boney black creature. He had a hunched back for he didn't find in the crawl space and his eyes were a solid black mass with bright white pupils. They looked like an overjoyed clown and he had a huge white teething grin almost as if he wanted me to see him and was elated to finally be revealed. That's when I looked down to see my grandmother, her dead body ripped open organs coming out, the blood now pooling. Willy sees this and smiles wider, I mean I didn't even think it could get wider. But he points to her and cackles then sticks his long shaped knifed fingers into her stomach and grabs out her heart. I cover my mouth and begin to sob thinking of a way to get out of here.

 The lights flicker and he begins to crawl closer and closer to me. I could hear the cracking of bones as he tried to follow me though the growing smaller space. I decided my best chance was to run back into the tunnel to crawl space and try to get out somehow. Sprinting Willy laughs and tries to grab my ankle to which I scream and begin to crawl faster the liquid that was once falling on my hand in droplets now pouring on me and making the floor wet and hard to crawl through Willy start to check up. But I'm so close I can make it I know it and that's when I pull myself out I see the light but I realized that Willy is no longer chasing me and now looking around the house is spinning, I feel as if I am drunk. I try to walk to the door but fall to my knees and grab my stomach and cry. Then I look down at my hands at the liquid that covered all over me.

 It's blood and I begin to bring it up to my mouth and slurp it up from my hands now realizing that I didn't make it out, my eyes flashing to my grandma's body and me over it digging my hands into her pulling out whatever I can to eat. I felt like I just had to keep eating and eating that If I the monster inside of me would eat me from inside out. When I feel and hand on my shoulder it grips tightly and I look up and my eyes meet once more with Willy. He smiles and I go back to eating. The last thing I remember was walking upstairs and all the glassed painted windows were covered in holes, the moon light shining in. 

In the case of the house a neighbor had called in to say there was a foul smell coming from along with screaming in the house and once police came for a wellness check they had found a 25 year old Chole eating her passed away grandmother and shrieking about the holes in the windows. She was taken to a hospital for the mentilly ill. Later that year the house was condemned. There have been no more cases from this property since then but speclution  says it has a bad aura.

End of recording:
3 years after the incident chole came in and re-listened to her statement.

State your name ‚ÄúChole Sharp im 28‚Äù the young girl nervously says across from me. 
‚ÄúNow that you've listened, what do you think?‚Äù I ask
‚ÄúI mean i don't even know I don't believe in this stuff.‚Äù She begins to mudder. 
‚ÄúWell didn't you just get out of the ward.‚Äù I ask 
I did but I was just so confused, I mean that can‚Äôt be me.‚Äù She raises her voice

I went to three interviews, got the job, and then ordered myself cute tennis skirts for the new job I just got. After I did that, I got a message from my job about my schedule. It says I‚Äôm a SERVER‚Ä¶ not a Bev Cart girl‚Ä¶ so upon receiving that I reached out to the manager and asked what this is, I applied for Bev cart, not serving 
*CONTEXT- I served before, no shade on the serving industry but some people get the hang out of it and do great, and others (me) do not. It‚Äôs a tough gig. The only job I‚Äôve had was a Barista at Starbucks for 4 years, and that is it. 
So back to the story. When he told me I have to train on serving to get the hang of the food, customers, and drinks then I can be a Bev cart girl. I then said ‚Äúokay that is fine‚Äù and left it at that. After one week of working there, it was fine. Then life happens. On a Monday in April I woke up with terrible back pain. I then went to my chiropractor that morning to see what is going on. I could barely move, couldn‚Äôt sit down without feeling pain and it was unbearable. My chiropractor then said she will schedule an MRI on that following Thursday. The following day my back was okay, but still hurt. I took my dogs outside and then it happened. My dogs saw a baby squirrel and attacked it and i intervened and while picking up the squirrel I got bit in the process‚Ä¶ it was only a small bite so nothing crazy. The squirrel was fine i relocated it and i told my mom what had happened and she said to go the clinic to see if i need a rabies. So the following day, Wednesday, I did. I was supposed to work that night but I was in the ER for 5 hours. I had an hour until work, so I told my manager I wouldn‚Äôt be able to work, I told him everything that went down and he felt bad for me. So he was fine with it. I didn‚Äôt leave till close to 7pm, I got there at 12pm‚Ä¶. ANYWAYS on Thursday I had my MRI and another follow up on my rabies shot and got the first three. You may wonder why i didn‚Äôt get it on Wednesday when I was there for 7 hours. Well after waiting and waiting by 6:30 they told me they didn‚Äôt have the first three shots you get for rabies. I only talked to three nurses, signed two papers, and laid on a bed. Got charged $700, for nothing. So anyways, on Thursday I got my MRI results and it turns out I have degenerative disc disease, mild stenosis, a tear in my L4-L5 and two bulging discs. All in my lower spine. (This all happened from working out legs and me doing hip thrusts is when this whole things started) on Friday I told my boss this and he was shocked because how young I am and I told him I will get random flareups. But here is the context on why I may have it: I have 5‚Äô11, I was born with scoliosis and I was terrible on my back due to me being in colorguard and dance for years. I also worked out and used heavy weights. It‚Äôs also hereditary so I got it from my dad. 
Anyways, a week after all of this I was working at my first job (a drive thru coffee shop) and we‚Äôve been having really bad plumbing issues. When I was mopping I went to walk to a car that came by and slipped and fell on my back. I got the wind knocked out of me, the lady climbed through the window to help me get up because I couldn‚Äôt due to me landing on my already broken back. She wanted to call 911 but I told her no and instead called my boss what happened and she came in to help close and told me to go home. I called my mom and she took me to my doctor to see if I messed up my back even more. Well I did. I got another MRI and when I said I stenosis, I‚Äôm the first MRI it was mild, now it‚Äôs severe. My tear in my L4-L5 went straight up to my L2-L3. It‚Äôs also causing me to have nerve damage in the outside of my spine. I was supposed to work that night and I told my boss about it 45 minutes before I was supposed to go in. I was put on some high medication for my pain so I wasn‚Äôt able to text back fast enough. He accused me of faking it all and saying I‚Äôm lazy and upset i didn‚Äôt get the Bev cart job. My mom read the text to me and she wanted to say something but I told her not to and just leave him on read. The next day when I woke up I woke up to 15 texts from him claiming I am a piece of shit and lazy. He even called me a whore because on my first day of serving I got 4 guys numbers on their receipts. ( I have a bf). He then asks me for pictures of proof of my admission to the doctors and wants a Dr.notes. Which is so weird for him to ask because last Sunday (Easter sunday) I had to go get my third shot of rabies at 4 and I was scheduled till 4 and I asked to leave a little bit earlier and he said that‚Äôs fine and I asked if he needed a Dr notes and he said no we don‚Äôt ask for that kind of stuff‚Ä¶.. so why is he asking now?? 
He‚Äôs seen me wear my back brace, he‚Äôs seen me do my stretches cause my back tenses up when I‚Äôm on my feet to much. He‚Äôs seen me take meds to help with the pain. I just don‚Äôt understand. So I just simply said ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm sorry you feel that way. Have a nice life a nice day.‚Äù and just left it at that. He scheduled me for the following week and I‚Äôm simply just not gonna go. If he can treat me like that why should I waste my time with a guy, especially a boss, and just go ahead and work for him? My doctors told me I need rest and not to work until we figure out a plan if I need surgery or do steroid shots 
*this job isn‚Äôt my only job, I have two other jobs so I‚Äôm not worried about losing this one* 
My mom thinks I‚Äôm an AH for not going in but also says I shouldn‚Äôt deal with someone like that. I simply don‚Äôt want to put up with a POS of a boss. It‚Äôs actually insane to me. My other coworkers there believe me and are trying to back me up. They have me on snap and I post all my medical stuff on it so they‚Äôve seen it. They even told me they don‚Äôt get asked for proof of a medical stuff when they have to go suddenly and can‚Äôt make it to work. Idk, is it just me or am I the AH?

Months of studying had come down to this moment. I had read all the books, done thousands of practice questions, attended review classes... but suddenly none of that seemed to calm my nerves.

The strategy that helped me the most was visualizing success before I even entered the building. Every night for two weeks before my test, I closed my eyes and imagined myself sitting confidently at the computer, breathing steadily, reading each question carefully, and knowing the answers. I didn‚Äôt just think about passing  I felt it in my body like it had already happened.

Another thing that kept me focused was creating a mantra. I told myself: ""One question at a time. One breath at a time."" Every time I started to panic   especially when I saw a tough SATA (Select All That Apply) question   I would whisper that mantra silently in my head. It grounded me.

I also made sure to treat the NCLEX like a marathon, not a sprint. I scheduled my exam in the late morning because I knew I‚Äôm not a morning person. I ate a real breakfast (eggs, toast, and coffee  nothing new that could upset my stomach). I packed a water bottle and a snack for the break. I planned for little things because I realized confidence doesn't just come from ""believing""  it comes from being prepared.

Maybe the most powerful thing, though, was changing my relationship with fear. I stopped seeing fear as a sign that I wasn‚Äôt ready. Instead, I told myself, ""Nerves mean you care. You‚Äôre ready."" That simple mental shift turned my fear into adrenaline and focus.

When I finally saw the screen go blue after 75 questions, my heart stopped. I thought, That‚Äôs it? I walked out not knowing if I had passed or failed, but I walked out proud because I stayed calm, stayed focused, and stayed present.

Two days later, when I saw my name on the BON (Board of Nursing) website... I cried. All the little strategies, the late nights, the early mornings, the self-doubt, the hope  it all led to that moment.

If you're getting ready for your NCLEX, just remember: it‚Äôs not about being perfect. It's about staying present, managing your mind, and trusting your preparation. You are ready.",1,1745694921.0,IfailedNCLEX,0,1.0,False

When he broke up we still loved each other and he agreed to try to maintain a friendship and ""wait for me - if I changed maybe hed come back to me"" but he did say it wouldnt be in a near future (maybe coulple of months). The weekend afterwards we were still texting and he said things like he felt as if I was everything in is life to him, that i was fantastic, and said he didnt hate me. In between I wrote a page to him respectfully showing my side of the story because he was blaming me for everything and twisting my actions when he called it off and I found it unfair. Then all of a sudden he says he was hurt by what he read and he doesnt want to talk to me anymore until the day we were supposed to have coffe and return our stuff.
I had to antecipate that date and we ended up just returning our stuff in the entryway of my building, and he was feral; said he hated me, that I havent changed at all, and that all I did was manipulation (...just by explaining myself). Still, he agreed to have that coffee 3 weeks forward but with NC on the meantime

He unfollowed me from everything and removed all of our messages and photos which left me confused because he said we could still be friends.

After some anger and speculation, 3 weeks have passed and he has been returning my messages about the time and date and how to move forward without feeling resentment from one another with more that just a ""üëçüèº"". Usually its me who reaches out but its been more respecful.

He did show a lot of anger in that time and he did tell me that he was better off without me and not to hope too much on taking me back. This was a person who just a week before leaving me said hed end it if I left him.

Well, Im wondering what do you think I can expect when I have coffee with him tuesday. Was he bluffing or is he softening and will perhaps reconsider? Im honestly so lost and obsiously still hope he cares about me in some way.",1,1745694902.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Overall, I'm down 4lbs, and very pleased! (I did write this all out into ChatGPT and had it organize/polish this post for me):

**üíâ The Basics:**

* Took my first 2.5mg shot this past Sunday.
* Injected 2 inches below my belly button on the right side.
* Planning to try my thigh for tomorrow night's shot.
* My doc said I could titrate to 5mg week 3 if I tolerate 2.5mg well, but insurance won‚Äôt cover more until after week 3, so it looks like I‚Äôll be on 2.5mg for a month.

**üëç The Good:**

* Food noise was gone from Monday‚ÄìThursday. I haven't craved chips or snack food at all, which has been a major issue for me for a very long time.
* When cravings did hit (Thursday/Friday evenings), it was sugar-related. Had some chocolate, but the portion was super controlled compared to my usual.
* Diet has been mostly high protein, low fat, moderate carbs.

**üíßThe Hydration Game:**

* I‚Äôve been chugging so many fluids that I gave myself a sore throat from all the drinking üòÇ
* I've been judging my hydration level by the color of my urine.
* Using coconut water for electrolytes for now. Ordered Drywater packets for some variety.

**üí© The Ugly (GI Stuff):**

* No poop for 3.5 days. Tried everything:
   * Tons of water
   * Fiber + flaxseed in smoothies and oatmeal
   * Citrucel, Mag07
   * ¬æ cap of Miralax in my coffee
* Finally got relief on Thursday (the miralax is what pushed it over the edge), and also went regularly on Friday (without taking anything), and then‚Ä¶ diarrhea Saturday morning. üòÖ
* I think it was from a giant egg white scramble with butter & TJ‚Äôs Unexpected Cheddar. Felt bloated Friday but better now.

**‚ö†Ô∏è The Weird One ‚Äì Menstrual Changes:**

* I‚Äôm 45 with historically very regular periods.
* Finished my last period just over a week ago, started spotting mid-week, which has turned into full-on bleeding (not too heavy).
* No cramps, but I felt some bloating/pressure in my uterus earlier in the week.
* Feeling much better now, but definitely watching it.
* I‚Äôve read others had this side effect too. I‚Äôm hesitant to tell my doctor just yet because I don‚Äôt want her to take me off the Zep. But if it continues beyond a typical cycle, I absolutely will.

**Looking Ahead:**

* Second 2.5mg shot tomorrow night.
* Planning to inject in the thigh this time.
* Still feeling positive and motivated.
* Very happy with 4lbs down in Week 1!

1k8klzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k8klzr/how_does_the_3m_hf25s_water_filter_perform_a/,How does the 3M HF25-S Water Filter perform? A detailed review,"The 3M HF25-S Water Filtration System landed in my life at a moment I was deeply frustrated with cloudy tap water and a faintly metallic taste sneaking into my daily glass. As someone who works in a bustling caf√©, I‚Äôve spent countless hours around commercial filtration systems. Testing it wasn‚Äôt just another ‚Äútask‚Äù on the list but rather an extension of the relentless quest for better-tasting water‚Äîboth at home and professionally. The HF25-S genuinely intrigued me with its claim to reduce sediment and ensure safety and reliability in water filtration. But does it live up to the hype? Well, let‚Äôs explore.

**Design and Build Quality**

What strikes me immediately about this water filter is its compact form. Measuring just 3 inches in diameter and 12 inches in height, it‚Äôs impressively sleek. The easy-to-install design requires no complex fiddling. I swapped my older filter unit in record time, especially with the simple twist-off mechanism. Its lightweight 1-pound build made the entire experience hassle-free. The plastic construction feels durable, although I‚Äôd be lying if I said it feels Ultra-premium. But hey, it‚Äôs NSF certified for safety, so it‚Äôs at least not cutting corners where it matters most. 

**Core Functionality and Installation**

Installing this under-sink filter in my kitchen was a breeze‚Äîno special tools or expertise necessary. Even my coworker, who considers IKEA furniture a mortal enemy, commented on the simplicity. Its function is clear-cut yet impressive: reducing sediment, improving water‚Äôs taste, and ensuring purity. After running it for the first time, I noticed an immediate improvement in water clarity. Whether brewing coffee, refilling water bottles, or handwashing produce, everything just felt fresher. That said, I was curious how it would perform under the more intense demands of a food service environment, and its reliability didn‚Äôt disappoint even after weeks of heavy use.

**Key Benefits**

- Genuine OEM design ensures safety during use.  
- Compact footprint fits the tightest under-sink spaces.  
- Requires minimal tools for installation, making it beginner-friendly.  
- NSF-certified for peace of mind regarding contaminants.  

[Check 3M HF25-S price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b077tprk8b/)

**Performance: Testing the Water Quality**

After gulping some water through this system, I‚Äôd describe the taste as crisp. It significantly reduced that odd metallic tang that had previously plagued my faucet. Brewing coffee became a revelation, with my beans tasting brighter, an outcome I didn‚Äôt fully expect. Its impact on sediment filtration was equally impressive; I literally tested the outflow with clear glasses side by side and could see less residual floating particles compared to untreated water. Over time, it quietly kept things pristine‚Äîno clogging, no sudden flow reductions. That said, after about two months, I logged a slightly slower flow rate, suggesting that keeping replacements on hand is a smart move.

**Plusses**

- Noticeable improvement in water taste, especially in brewed beverages.  
- Reliable sediment filtration, enhancing visual clarity alongside flavor.  
- Keeps up with everyday demand both at home and in small-scale caf√©s.  

**Limitations**

No product is perfect, and this filter isn‚Äôt any different. For starters, the flow rate isn‚Äôt supersonic‚Äîit‚Äôs adequate but not spectacular. Replacing the filter every six months can also feel like a chore that sneaks up on you, but that‚Äôs common territory in this category. Lastly, the plastic housing‚Äîdespite being sturdy‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt blow me away aesthetically. Filter systems can be utilitarian, sure, but some design pizzazz wouldn‚Äôt hurt.

- Flow rate diminishes gradually with heavy use.  
- Filter replacements add maintenance costs mid-year.  
- Plasticky feel lacks a premium touch.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing it to a big-name rival, the Frizzlife Under Sink Water Filter, the 3M HF25-S has a clear advantage in simplicity. The latter is more plug-and-play, whereas something like Frizzlife requires more effort during setup. However, Frizzlife‚Äôs inline design offers slightly better space efficiency for kitchens where literally every inch counts. On the other hand, Brita faucet filters, while more user-friendly straight out of the packaging, are dwarfed by the exhaustion 3M can handle in commercial settings. You could say while Brita is great for occasional use, the HF25-S provides consistent reliability for people, like me, who guzzle water or need industrial-grade output. Cost efficiency tilts in 3M's favor as well‚ÄîFrizzlife tends to lean pricier for marginally comparable results.

**Affordable Quality**

What stands out about this water filter is its competitive pricing compared to other commercial-use systems while managing to retain quality across demanding usage. Considering features like the NSF certification and sediment reduction, it delivers excellent value without unnecessary frills. Whether you‚Äôre upgrading from a budget option or considering stepping up from disposable faucet filters, this model feels like money well spent. It strikes that sweet spot between high-end filtration capabilities and practical, everyday usability.

I am a naturally shy 28 year old woman who lives in a small town and all my high school friends have moved for college or work.

Our convos have been long, 3-4 hours when we hang out and while I do contribute, I find myself not having much to say, or at least anything I think he would find interesting. The convo gets awkward and dry sometimes and takes him initiating a new topic or me asking a question about himself to start again. I feel bad but I literally sometimes can‚Äôt think of things to say. I just worry that he won‚Äôt bother spending time with me anymore.

Magic? Nope, it's cookies - and they're probably the most dangerous snack in your web app's kitchen. 

**The key thing to understand:** Cookies are how your app remembers who's who between page visits.

When someone logs into your vibe coded app, you give their browser a special cookie that says ""this person is authenticated."" Every time they visit a new page, their browser automatically sends that cookie back to prove who they are. No re-entering passwords needed.

**Real Cookie Disasters I've Witnessed (names redacted for confidentiality):**  
  
\* *A webdev agency missed enabling the ""Secure"" flag (this forces Cookies to be sent via HTTPS) on a real estate listing project. This meant login cookies were sent unencrypted - like shouting your password across a coffee shop. Hackers stole sessions from public WiFi users in real-time.*  
  
\* A health-tech startup stored *""user preferences"" in cookies for convenience. Later, they found payment details were accidentally being saved there too - completely unencrypted, like leaving credit cards in a shopping cart overnight.*  
   
\* *An e-commerce site didn't properly expire sessions. When a user's laptop was stolen, the thief had full access for weeks - even after the victim changed their password, because the old ""session token"" (digital key) kept working.*

The worst part? Unlike password breaches which require a new login, or API key theft which requires technical knowledge, stolen cookies give instant access with no special skills required.

**How to keep your cookies safe (tbh there are LAYERS to the topic, but covering the items below is a solid start)**

# 1. Lock Down Cookie Access

* ‚òëÔ∏è¬†**Block hackers from stealing cookies**¬†‚Üí Enable ""HttpOnly"" (stops malicious scripts).
* ‚òëÔ∏è¬†**Force HTTPS only**¬†‚Üí Enable ""Secure"" (no unencrypted sending).

# 2. Make Cookies Expire Smartly

* ‚è≥¬†**Short sessions**¬†‚Üí Log users out after 15-30 mins of inactivity (adjust based on sensitivity).
* üìÖ¬†**""Remember Me""**¬†‚Üí Max 30-90 days, then require re-login.

# 3. Store Less, Protect More

* üîí¬†**Never store passwords or personal info in cookies**¬†‚Üí Use random session IDs only.
* üö´¬†**If hacked, limit damage**¬†‚Üí Cookies should¬†*point*¬†to data (not contain it).

# 4. Log Out = Truly Log Out

* ‚ùå¬†**Don‚Äôt just delete the cookie**¬†‚Üí Invalidate sessions¬†*server-side*¬†(or hackers can reuse stolen cookies).
* üì±¬†**Let users see active logins**¬†‚Üí Offer a ""Devices"" page (like Google/Gmail).

# 5. Change Session IDs Often

* üîÑ¬†**New ID on login/logout**¬†‚Üí Prevents ""session stealing"" attacks.
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è¬†**New ID after privilege changes**¬†(e.g., user ‚Üí admin).

# 6. Extra Shields (If Possible)

* üõ°Ô∏è¬†**Add CSRF tokens**¬†‚Üí Extra protection against forged requests.
* üìç¬†**Check for sudden location changes**¬†‚Üí Log out if a user‚Äôs IP/device jumps suspiciously.

# 7. Clean Up & Monitor

* üßπ¬†**Clear cookies on logout**¬†‚Üí Tell browsers to wipe them (via¬†`Clear-Site-Data`).
* üîç¬†**Watch for weird activity**¬†‚Üí Alert on rapid logins from different countries.

Magic? Nope, it's cookies - and they're probably the most dangerous snack in your web app's kitchen. 

**The key thing to understand:** Cookies are how your app remembers who's who between page visits.

When someone logs into your vibe coded app, you give their browser a special cookie that says ""this person is authenticated."" Every time they visit a new page, their browser automatically sends that cookie back to prove who they are. No re-entering passwords needed.

**Real Cookie Disasters I've Witnessed (names redacted for confidentiality):**  
  
\* *A webdev agency missed enabling the ""Secure"" flag (this forces Cookies to be sent via HTTPS) on a real estate listing project. This meant login cookies were sent unencrypted - like shouting your password across a coffee shop. Hackers stole sessions from public WiFi users in real-time.*  
  
\* A health-tech startup stored *""user preferences"" in cookies for convenience. Later, they found payment details were accidentally being saved there too - completely unencrypted, like leaving credit cards in a shopping cart overnight.*  
   
\* *An e-commerce site didn't properly expire sessions. When a user's laptop was stolen, the thief had full access for weeks - even after the victim changed their password, because the old ""session token"" (digital key) kept working.*

The worst part? Unlike password breaches which require a new login, or API key theft which requires technical knowledge, stolen cookies give instant access with no special skills required.

**How to keep your cookies safe (tbh there are LAYERS to the topic, but covering the items below is a solid start)**

# 1. Lock Down Cookie Access

* ‚òëÔ∏è¬†**Block hackers from stealing cookies**¬†‚Üí Enable ""HttpOnly"" (stops malicious scripts).
* ‚òëÔ∏è¬†**Force HTTPS only**¬†‚Üí Enable ""Secure"" (no unencrypted sending).

# 2. Make Cookies Expire Smartly

* ‚è≥¬†**Short sessions**¬†‚Üí Log users out after 15-30 mins of inactivity (adjust based on sensitivity).
* üìÖ¬†**""Remember Me""**¬†‚Üí Max 30-90 days, then require re-login.

# 3. Store Less, Protect More

* üîí¬†**Never store passwords or personal info in cookies**¬†‚Üí Use random session IDs only.
* üö´¬†**If hacked, limit damage**¬†‚Üí Cookies should¬†*point*¬†to data (not contain it).

# 4. Log Out = Truly Log Out

* ‚ùå¬†**Don‚Äôt just delete the cookie**¬†‚Üí Invalidate sessions¬†*server-side*¬†(or hackers can reuse stolen cookies).
* üì±¬†**Let users see active logins**¬†‚Üí Offer a ""Devices"" page (like Google/Gmail).

# 5. Change Session IDs Often

* üîÑ¬†**New ID on login/logout**¬†‚Üí Prevents ""session stealing"" attacks.
* ‚¨ÜÔ∏è¬†**New ID after privilege changes**¬†(e.g., user ‚Üí admin).

# 6. Extra Shields (If Possible)

* üõ°Ô∏è¬†**Add CSRF tokens**¬†‚Üí Extra protection against forged requests.
* üìç¬†**Check for sudden location changes**¬†‚Üí Log out if a user‚Äôs IP/device jumps suspiciously.

# 7. Clean Up & Monitor

* üßπ¬†**Clear cookies on logout**¬†‚Üí Tell browsers to wipe them (via¬†`Clear-Site-Data`).
* üîç¬†**Watch for weird activity**¬†‚Üí Alert on rapid logins from different countries.

1k8kfh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k8kfh4/does_the_homezay_nugget_ice_maker_deliver_the/,Does the HOMEZAY Nugget Ice Maker Deliver the Best Countertop Experience Review?,"The HOMEZAY B0DDXLJLMF Nugget Ice Maker has become a staple in my kitchen for one simple reason‚Äîit serves up a fresh batch of soft, chewable nugget ice in no time. I'm an ice enthusiast, and the promise of nugget-style ice was a game-changer. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first, but using this compact ice maker daily has truly shifted my perspective. From afternoon iced coffee with the family to blended margaritas on weekend nights with friends, it's quickly proven its worth.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
This countertop ice maker is compact yet sturdy. Its dimensions‚Äî11.3 x 8.5 x 12.6 inches‚Äîoffer a small enough footprint to comfortably sit on most kitchen counters without taking over valuable workspace. At 17.64 pounds, it‚Äôs portable enough to move around if needed, but substantial enough not to slide around while in use. A sleek exterior elevates the modern aesthetic, making it a blend of function and design. The included LED indicator and single-button operation make the machine surprisingly user-friendly. My 14-year-old niece was able to operate it on her first try.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
The ice production amazes me‚Äî33 pounds a day! That‚Äôs about 150 drinks‚Äô worth of ice in 24 hours. Chewable nugget ice is ready in just ten minutes after powering it on. Whether I needed ice for something as basic as chilling water or creating fancy cocktails for guests, the consistency and speed of the production couldn‚Äôt be better. I‚Äôve previously owned ice makers that are slow and temperamental, but this device feels much more dependable. 

**[Check HOMEZAY B0DDXLJLMF price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0ddxljlmf/)**  

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
Cleaning ice machines has always been a chore, but the self-cleaning feature on this one? Pure genius. Add water or a vinegar-water solution, press the button, and it handles the tough work for you. When it‚Äôs done, all I have to do is drain it over the sink. As someone who previously spent way too much time scrubbing tiny nooks and crannies in older models, this feature is a blessing I didn‚Äôt know I needed.  

**Chewable Ice Texture**  
Let‚Äôs talk about the standout feature of this ice maker: chewable nugget ice. The texture is perfect‚Äînot too hard and not too melty. If you‚Äôre a fan of restaurants that serve chewable ice, this machine brings that same luxury to your kitchen. I‚Äôve found it works great in blended drinks like smoothies, juices, and frozen cocktails, delivering a refreshing and versatile base every time. My kids can‚Äôt get enough of it in their sodas.  

**Positives**  
- Quick ice production within 10 minutes  
- Compact size, perfect for countertops  
- Convenient self-cleaning function  
- Quiet operation, even during peak use  

**Negatives**  
- Doesn‚Äôt store ice for extended periods‚Äîit melts and recycles if not used  
- A slightly higher noise level during self-cleaning mode  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this model to other nugget ice makers, the attention to detail becomes clear. For example, Opal's countertop ice maker has a similar appeal with chewable ice and compact dimensions, but it's often heavier and pricier. Unlike the HOMEZAY unit, some competitors fail to include a one-button design or self-cleaning functionality, adding unnecessary complication to daily use. On the other hand, models like GE Profile‚Äôs nugget ice maker may boast higher output, but they lack the same portability and user-friendly cleaning settings.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Assessing whether the HOMEZAY Nugget Ice Maker justifies its price tag was a key question for me. Given the consistent daily output, durability, and user-friendly elements like self-cleaning, I rate it highly on cost-effectiveness. It‚Äôs rare to find a product that balances convenience, reliability, and performance without feeling overpriced. Plus, its chewable nugget ice feels like a premium feature in itself.

I've had my Barista Express for about seven years now, and after lurking here and seeing all your upgrade posts, I'm starting to get that itch. 

For context: I've got a good scale, decent hefty distributor and tamper, and use a bottomless portafilter, and the Breville Dosing Funnel (which has been a game-changer for mess control). I also stopped storing beans in the hopper a while ago because I like being able to switch things up (like if it's late and I want to make a decaf without having a full-blown existential crisis at 10pm).

So my workflow right now is: grab beans from an airtight container, weigh them, pour into hopper, grind with the built-in grinder, distribute (no WDT because I'm lazy), tamp, and manually start the shot while timing it on the scale. It's a bit of a whole production at this point. Feels a little extra sometimes.

Lately I‚Äôve been wondering if upgrading to the Barista Express Impress or the Touch Impress would actually make life easier... less fuss, more consistency, that sort of thing. Before I start spiraling into full research mode, figured I'd ask:

Would upgrading meaningfully improve my setup, or am I just looking for an excuse to buy a shiny new toy?

Appreciate any advice, horror stories, interventions, encouragement, or coffee. Thanks!",1,1745694011.0,BrevilleCoffee,5,1.0,False

I'm just a girl who likes energy drinks. I can't drink coffee or tea on an empty stomach, so I like to have energy drinks to fill the gap when I want caffeine first, and breakfast later. I started with Celsius, which gives me the best jolt. I added Alani and Ghost to the mix. Alani has the best taste, but sometimes I wish the 12 oz can was bigger. 

I have heard good things about Gorilla mind, and want to try it. My only hestiance is that it, like C4, is from a brand that normally sells pre workout. I don't want an energy drink that has the ""pre workout"" tingles effects that C4 has. It seems to me that Gorilla mind does not contain Beta Alanine. So it is safe from that?

And if the men I truly admire are on LinkedIn, why not look them up there? It's wild, I know, but if I'm gonna invest my time, let it be with a man who can at least write a complete message without fire emojis.

So I decided to give it a shot. And low and behold, my first connection that went somewhere was with Diego... on LinkedIn. Wild. It felt easy and...natural.

So yeah, My  process went kinda like this (lol):

**who's On My Radar** (filter): basically looked for guys in tech, consulting, creative fields, people who seem driven. If I saw founder or ceo but couldn't find their company online. Red flag. NEXT.

**profile pic:** had to be professional-ish but not boring. Someone I was actually attracted to. No gym selfies or bathroom mirror pics, please

**work experience:** wasn't looking for the richest dude, just someone with a solid track record tells me a lot about their goals and stability.

**skill check:** if communication or leadership had multiple endorsements. My brain went ""oooh"", who might actually be nice to people!



My move was to find something cool they posted, drop a genuine comment, and then send the connection request. My  go-to message (totally steal this btw, it worked lol):

""Hey \[Name\], really interesting point you made about \[topic in their post/profile\]. Would love to connect and maybe learn more about your take on \[something else specific from their profile\].""

  
Key takeaway here: play it cool. You are not desperate.

  
After Diego accepted, I started playing the engagement game but subtly (dont wanna freak em out). A like here, maybe an ""insightful"" comment there.

A few days later, I sent a casual message related to something in his experience. He didnt reply instantly, but when he did, the conversation actually flowed!!! it felt...awww. so I smoothly dropped a line about wanting to keep the convo going and wrote: hey you, I've been digging into \[the topic we were chatting about\] more. Would you mind if I shot you a text to keep talking about this?

We exchanged numbers and agreed to grab coffee. I wish I could tell you it was sparks fly. But honestly, he was talking about his ""vision"" I got this weird vibe. It wasnt chemistry; it felt like he was... selling me on investing in his cryptos. 

Disappointment :(

LITERALLY that same afternoon, another connection replied‚Äì a support engineer. His profile pic was way less corporate, but his messages were genuinely funny and felt super sincere.

We talked for hours that night. The conversation was so good. When he asked me out to dinner I was excited! and then he drops this: Rosie , quick question, you mind if I bring my grandma? I'm her caregiver and don't wanna leave her alone tonight.

1k8kdi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibew_apprentices/comments/1k8kdi6/aptitude_test/,Aptitude test,"Took a test for 269 recently. God I hope I got in.
Overall:
Studied for about 30 days of algebra basics and Algebra 1 from Khan Academy. Kahn academy was very helpful, it‚Äôs been over 10 years since high school math. 
Took the Ultimate electrician‚Äôs free exam night before and got 82(they suggest 90)
Had issue with quadratics and sequences.
Day of exam: 5hours of sleep, woke up hydrated, showered, yoga and light run, coffee vitamins and electrolytes. 
During the IBEW exam I‚Äôd say the pool of questions where outside of what I studied enough for. Don‚Äôt think I did as well as I liked for the math.
IBEW exam had sequences that I skipped over immediately, there were problems such as Y=x/2+5 what statements are true if x is <5 and I had no idea how to attack those. In addition the graphs I had little experience with and were difficult to read, laptop screen and having points land on what was a guess of 37 or 36 as it was between 20-40 on y axis that fell on just shy of 15 on x axis.
In addition another difficult part was stress I began making minor mistakes which made me 2nd guess answers from previous problems I had given. 
If I could sequences and graphs would be great to go over more practice, little confidence led me to skip and return with little time. I was able to return to questions: in my heart I think I had 24 right, 1 maybe and 7 guesses and one I ran out of time no answer so automatic wrong. I spent a lot of time on quadratic and slope but mostly didn‚Äôt need besides quick identification to answer a graph question or two, as well as functions on graphs and equations weren‚Äôt used in my pool. 
I‚Äôd say being conservative I got 34/36 right on reading, more than enough time but I‚Äôm sure overlooking a key word or two could have costed me the correct answer. I.E. as how many colored grapes are mentioned at the market 1) several, 2)more than 2 3) 3 at jacks table and 2 in Jill‚Äôs basket 4) there are red, green, purple, cotton candy and white grapes at the market. And the passage listed multiple colors including white, red and green grapes were at available at the market.
Math felt more difficult than the given problems on Kahn but closer on ultimate electricians. 
Suggest taking a few practice exams. 
Personally, If I don‚Äôt pass the aptitude, I will enroll in a course at my local CC and be honest about my intentions with my instructor to see if they can provide similar problems and/or adjacent homework.

TLDR: 
Kahn academy‚Äôs problems were easier, ultimate electrician has near same problems difficulty wise. Exam was more difficult and less topics than I studied (30 days) for. Reading wasn‚Äôt difficult and had extra time.
If I make it will update, if I didn‚Äôt I will study again and take an alg 1 course at local community college. ",1,1745693891.0,ibew_apprentices,0,1.0,False

1k8kcuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k8kcuj/could_the_zamron_cold_brew_coffee_maker_be_your/,Could the Zamron Cold Brew Coffee Maker be your ultimate pitcher? Review here!,"The **Zamron 3 Cold Brew Coffee Maker** genuinely surprised me with its functionality and practicality. With its food-grade glass construction and sleek gray color, this cold brew coffee pitcher fits seamlessly into my daily coffee routine. I find myself reaching for it every morning, whether I‚Äôm brewing my favorite cold coffee or experimenting with iced teas and infused fruit drinks. While I‚Äôve been satisfied with the product overall, there are some key considerations worth highlighting.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the robust build of this cold brew coffee maker. Made from thick soda lime glass, it feels solid, durable, and safe for daily use. Unlike plastic alternatives, there‚Äôs no risk of that odd plastic taste leaching into your brew. I‚Äôve accidentally clinked it against my sink more times than I‚Äôd like to admit, and it still holds up like a champ. However, do keep in mind one caveat‚Äîit‚Äôs not suitable for hot liquids right out of the fridge, which isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for me, but worth noting if you‚Äôre considering all-in-one versatility.  

**Ease of Use**  
Using this pitcher is ridiculously straightforward, even for someone like me who isn‚Äôt a morning person. Its ergonomic thickened handle ensures a secure grip, a savior when I‚Äôm half asleep. The threaded cap with a silicone ring seals tightly, meaning no messy leaks on my countertops. The pour spout lid is an unexpected bonus, allowing for drip-free pouring‚Äîpractical when serving guests or simply saving myself cleanup time.  

[Ready to buy Zamron 3? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d929jtc9/)

**Filter Performance**  
One of its standout features is the finely woven 160-micron filter made from stainless steel. It‚Äôs designed to keep coffee grounds out of your brew, and so far, it‚Äôs exceeded my expectations. The resulting coffee is smooth, rich, and devoid of any sediment that would typically distract from the flavor. I‚Äôve also noticed that the filter doesn‚Äôt rust or degrade after frequent use‚Äîsomething I can‚Äôt say for every coffee maker I‚Äôve tried in the past.

**Advantages**  
- Constructed from food-grade glass, ensuring a clean taste with every brew.  
- Dependable leak-proof design with a secure lid and silicone-sealed spout.  
- Easy washing with a thoughtful ergonomic handle and dishwasher-safe material.  
- Extremely versatile, suitable for cold brew coffee, iced tea, and even ingredient storage.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Glass material could be restrictive for those looking to brew hot drinks directly.  
- Slightly on the heavier side when filled, which might be an issue for those with reduced grip strength.  

**Cleaning Simplicity**  
Cleanup has always been my least favorite part of making coffee, but this product actually makes it tolerable. The included cleaning brush streamlines the process, and thanks to the premium glass construction, it‚Äôs dishwasher-safe. I‚Äôve never had to fight stubborn stains or odors, which is a game-changer compared to other pitchers I own. That said, the filter does require some attention‚Äîyou have to ensure all coffee grounds are thoroughly rinsed to maintain its effectiveness.

**Multi-Use Versatility**  
I‚Äôve played around with this pitcher beyond just cold brew coffee, and I have to say, it works wonders for iced teas and flavored waters. Recently, I made a batch of cold brew green tea infused with mint and lemon, and the results were phenomenal. You can even store pantry staples like nuts, sugar, or salt in it if needed. It‚Äôs refreshing to own a product that offers this kind of multipurpose usability.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this cold brew coffee maker to other brands, I‚Äôve noticed where it truly shines. For instance, some competitors use plastic, which can affect taste and durability over time. Models with cheaper filters tend to let sediment slip through, but the stainless steel fine mesh filter in this pitcher ensures consistently smooth coffee. While there are smaller and lighter models available, they often compromise on capacity, which makes this one perfect for entertaining. A downside worth acknowledging is its heavier build compared to products like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker, which might appeal more to users prioritizing portability.  

**Value for Money**  
When assessing the cost-to-quality ratio, this cold brew coffee pitcher holds its ground. Its long-lasting build and premium-grade materials make it a financially smart choice for regular users like myself. While there are cheaper glass pitchers on the market, they either lack the same secure seal or don‚Äôt integrate a high-quality filter. It also eliminates the need for disposable coffee filter packs, which saves money over time. Whether you‚Äôre a veteran cold brew drinker or just starting out, I feel it‚Äôs worth the investment for what you‚Äôre getting.

It's been so long that some of the details are a bit fuzzy. It's a somewhat long story because there is a lot of backstory that lead up to this moment but it's generally unimportant. Short version: my aunt used to get the family together for holiday dinners on Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Her neighbor, that she was very good friends with, had essentially no family other than her husband and daughter, so my aunt would always invite the three of them over.

The daughter never liked her full name, so she always liked for people to call her Tacia (tuh-SEE-uh). Only her parents would ever call her by her full name. I had heard her parents call her by her full name but had never seen it written. It was pronounced like AH-nis-tuh-SEE-uh. In my head, I could never quite picture how it was spelled. Always imagined something like Honestacia or something strange like that because it was such an odd-sounding name and I always understood why she didn't like it.

Here's the real kicker. I was sitting in the living room this one particular year, and I happened to look down at the coffee table and i don't remember exactly what it was that i saw but it was some sort of paper that she had written her name on. I shit myself when I saw it.

1k8k84h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k8k84h/explore_the_krups_xp1020_steam_espresso_machine/,Explore the KRUPS XP1020 steam espresso machine review for a budget-friendly coffee solution!,"The KRUPS XP1020 Steam Espresso Machine left quite an impression on me during my time using it. It's a sleek, compact espresso machine that promises professional results in a home setting and delivers on most fronts. With a stainless-steel design and a 4-cup capacity glass carafe, it felt both stylish and practical in my kitchen. The first thing that caught my eye was its promise of passion and precision‚Äîtwo qualities that are hard not to admire in an espresso maker. But as with any product, it has its highs and lows.

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
This machine measures roughly 9.5 x 8.5 x 11 inches, fitting snugly in my small kitchen without feeling intrusive. It‚Äôs relatively lightweight, which is great because I find myself switching spots on my counter often. The stainless-steel exterior finish gives it a modern look, blending seamlessly with more premium appliances, although certain parts like the oversized control knob had a plastic feel that didn‚Äôt quite match the chic aesthetic. However, the included drip tray being removable was a nice touch for cleanliness and convenience‚Äîbig thumbs up there.

**Performance and Steaming Ability**  
The 750-watt steam-driven functionality is where this machine really leans into its strengths. Each batch effortlessly brewed up to four cups of espresso at once, a huge win when hosting a family brunch. The steam wand, fitted with a black tube cover, was surprisingly user-friendly even for someone who doesn‚Äôt have professional barista skills. Initially, the wand‚Äôs oversized dial took me a couple of tries to finesse correctly, but it held up well once I got the hang of it. A helpful tip: ditching the black cover on the attachment entirely makes frothing and foam management much smoother‚Äîmilk explosions were a no-go after doing so.

**Ease of Maintenance and Cleanup**  
Between brewing sessions, cleaning was something I actually didn‚Äôt dread with this machine. Both the carafe and drip tray are easy to remove and sanitize, though I noticed the glass used for the carafe felt a bit thin. I became overly cautious while washing it, and reviews suggest this fragility often leads to breakage over time. On the bright side, the reusable metal filter eliminated the need for single-use filters, saving me a fair bit of cost and waste!

[Check KRUPS XP1020 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b001a44jam/)  

**Merits**  
Here‚Äôs why this machine stands out:
- Compact size suits even small kitchens.
- Produces rich espresso at an affordable level.
- Effortless cleanup with removable, dishwasher-safe components.
- Great froth once you skip the black steam wand cover.
- Reusable filter reduces operational costs.

**Shortcomings**  
However, it's not perfect:
- Fragile glass carafe requires extra care.
- The steam wand's plastic cover design isn't practical, leading to potential milk mishaps.
- Rotary dial controls feel less intuitive compared to button-based systems.
- Not as portable due to increased size compared to earlier KRUPS models.  

**Product Contenders**  
Comparing it to its peers, the KRUPS XP1020 stacks up fairly well against brands like De'Longhi and Breville in its price range. For instance, entry-level De'Longhi models like the EC155 offer a pump-driven system that yields superior espresso shots, but the tradeoff is a higher price tag. Breville espresso makers outperform in terms of durability and premium feel, though they also don't cater to budget-conscious buyers. That said, for a simple steam-driven option, this product holds its own‚Äîbare-bones functionality that reliable brands like KRUPS have championed over time.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Price-to-performance on this steam espresso machine is quite reasonable, particularly if you‚Äôre dipping your toes into the world of home espresso making. Its cost-effectiveness makes it an intriguing option for beginners and coffee lovers who prefer a lower entry barrier. While not the ultimate choice for enthusiasts craving caf√©-level espresso quality, its affordability ensures you‚Äôre not left regretting the investment.

* **Vocabulary Categories in Everyday Moments:** Waiting for coffee? Name everything in the caf√© in Japanese. Stuck in traffic? Describe other cars by color and type. These micro-practices build retrieval pathways.
* **React to Media in Japanese:** Watch your regular shows but verbalize reactions in Japanese. Simple responses like *""„Åà„ÉºÔºÅ"" ""„Åæ„Åò„ÅßÔºü"" ""„Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ!""* create emotional connections to the language.
* **Watch a short Japanese youtube clip** Maybe when you just need a quick breather, try watching [Japanese cooking videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%E9%A3%9F%E3%81%B9%E7%89%A9%E4%BD%9C%E3%82%8A%E6%96%B9) or whatever your interested in
* **Voice Memo Conversations:** Record a question in Japanese, then answer it later. Having these mini-conversations with yourself builds speaking confidence without the pressure of a live partner. *(I actually built* [*kaiwa*](https://trykaiwa.com) *for this exact reason ‚Äî to make short, daily speaking practice as natural and easy to start as possible.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why Choose Vegan Bran Muffins Sweetened with Dates?

When looking to boost your fiber intake, vegan bran muffins are an excellent choice. Unlike traditional muffins packed with refined sugars and saturated fats, this recipe uses natural sweetness from dates, making it a healthier dessert or snack option. Dates not only provide a rich, caramel-like flavor but also offer minerals like potassium and magnesium. dates into your bran muffins means you‚Äôre replacing empty calories with nutrient-dense ingredients.

The bran component is essential for anyone aiming to enhance their digestive health. Bran is a powerhouse of dietary fiber, which supports regular bowel movements and helps maintain a healthy gut. When you enjoy vegan bran muffins sweetened with dates, you benefit from a low-fat, high-fiber snack that keeps you energized and satisfied. This recipe appeals particularly to people who want to maintain a balanced, plant-based diet without sacrificing taste or texture.

### Nutritional Benefits of High-Fiber Vegan Muffins

Fiber plays a crucial role in health, especially when it comes from whole food sources like bran and dates. Here‚Äôs what makes high-fiber vegan bran muffins a smart choice:

- **Improves Digestion:** Fiber helps food move smoothly through your digestive tract, reducing constipation and promoting gut health.
- **Supports Weight Management:** High-fiber foods take longer to digest, keeping you full for longer and preventing overeating.
- **Regulates Blood Sugar:** Fiber slows sugar absorption, which helps maintain stable blood glucose levels, particularly useful for people managing diabetes.
- **Heart Health:** Soluble fiber in bran may lower cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of heart disease over time.
- **Plant-Based Protein:** Vegan bran muffins can also contain sources of protein, such as nuts or seeds, complementing a plant-based diet.

### The Role of Dates as a Natural Sweetener

Many traditional muffins rely on refined sugar, which can cause energy crashes and provide little to no nutritional value. Using dates as the sweetening agent is more than just a flavor upgrade‚Äîit‚Äôs a nutrition upgrade. Dates are naturally sweet and contain antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals like vitamin B6, iron, and magnesium.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
Additionally, dates come with fiber that works together with bran to improve digestion and slow the absorption of sugar. This combined effect means your blood sugar is less likely to spike compared to eating muffins sweetened with white sugar or corn syrup. You get a treat that satisfies your sweet tooth and supports your overall wellbeing.

### Crafting Your Own Vegan Bran Muffins

Making vegan bran muffins at home is simple and gives you control over the ingredients, so you know you‚Äôre consuming something nutritious and wholesome. When following a recipe that uses dates as a sweetener, you typically soak the dates in warm water until soft, then blend them into a paste. This paste mixes seamlessly into the batter to add moisture and natural sweetness.

Core ingredients include:

- Bran flakes or wheat bran for fiber
- Whole wheat or spelt flour
- Plant-based milk like almond or oat milk
- Baking powder for that light, fluffy texture
- Flax egg or chia egg to replace traditional eggs
- Date paste as a natural sweetener
- Optional mix-ins: nuts, raisins, or cinnamon to add flavor and nutrients

Preparing these muffins ensures you avoid artificial preservatives, excessive sugar, and unhealthy fats common in store-bought alternatives. Plus, the recipe is easy to customize to your taste preferences or dietary needs.

### Integrating Vegan Bran Muffins into Your Daily Routine

Vegan bran muffins sweetened with dates can fit into your daily life in many ways:

- **Breakfast Boost:** Start your morning with a fiber-packed muffin paired with a cup of tea or coffee.
- **Healthy Snack:** Keep muffins on hand for a quick snack that refuels without the sugar crash.
- **On-the-Go Nutrition:** Muffins are perfect for busy days when you need convenient, healthy food options.
- **Post-Workout Fuel:** The natural sugars in dates combined with fiber help replenish energy after exercise while aiding digestion.

Because these muffins are vegan, they also suit people with dairy allergies or lactose intolerance, making them widely accessible while promoting a lifestyle based on plant nutrition.

### Tips for Enhancing Flavor and Texture

To make your vegan bran muffins even more delicious and enjoyable:

- Toast the bran lightly before mixing to bring out a nutty flavor.
- Add warming spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger for a cozy twist.
- Mix in chopped walnuts or pecans for crunch and extra protein.
- Use ripe bananas or unsweetened applesauce to boost moistness if desired.
- Experiment with different plant milks for subtle changes in taste and creaminess.

These small tweaks allow you to personalize your muffins and keep mealtime interesting while staying on track with healthy eating habits.

### The Environmental and Ethical Appeal

Choosing vegan bran muffins isn‚Äôt just about personal health‚Äîit's also a choice that supports environmental sustainability. Plant-based baking reduces reliance on animal products, lowering carbon footprints and conserving water resources. By replacing refined sugars with dates, you also cut down on heavily processed ingredients.

Tips for Perfecting Your Vegan Bran Muffins: Ingredients, Baking, and Storage Strategies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Choosing the Right Ingredients for Your Vegan Bran Muffins

Creating delicious vegan bran muffins starts with selecting the best ingredients. To make these muffins both high in fiber and naturally sweetened, it's crucial to focus on nutrient-dense staples. Start with wheat bran, the star ingredient, as it is packed with dietary fiber that supports digestion and keeps you full longer. Pairing bran with whole wheat flour can improve the texture, giving the muffins a wholesome but tender crumb.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
Instead of refined sugar, use dates as your natural sweetener. Dates add a rich sweetness and moisture, cutting back on added sugars while providing antioxidants and vitamins. When using dates, it‚Äôs best to soak them in warm water before blending to make a smooth date paste. This will evenly distribute sweetness throughout the batter and enhance the muffins' moistness.

For the wet ingredients, plant-based milk like almond, oat, or soy milk works wonderfully. These options keep your muffins dairy-free without altering taste. Use vegetable oil or melted coconut oil to maintain a soft and moist texture. To give your muffins a lift without eggs, flaxseed or chia seed eggs are excellent vegan substitutes. They bind ingredients together while boosting fiber content and adding omega-3 fatty acids.

### Techniques to Perfect the Baking Process

Getting the right texture and rise for vegan bran muffins requires attention to a few key baking details. First, avoid overmixing the batter. Once the wet ingredients meet the dry, mix just until combined. Overmixing activates gluten in the flour, making muffins tough instead of tender.

Using baking soda along with baking powder balances acidity and encourages an even rise. For recipes with dates and bran, which are acidic, a little baking soda enhances fluffiness and prevents dense, heavy muffins.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
Preheat your oven properly‚Äîmost vegan bran muffin recipes bake best at 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Make sure your muffin tins are either lightly greased or lined with paper liners to prevent sticking while allowing easy release.

- **Fill muffin cups about two-thirds full:** This prevents overflow while ensuring a nice dome on top.
- **Check doneness early:** Start checking your muffins around 18 minutes by inserting a toothpick. It should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
- **Rotate the pan:** Halfway through baking, rotate your muffin tray to promote even browning.

### Storing Your Vegan Bran Muffins for Maximum Freshness

Proper storage extends the enjoyment of your bran muffins without compromising freshness or texture. First, allow the muffins to cool completely on a wire rack after baking. Storing them while warm traps steam, which can make muffins soggy.

For short-term storage, keep muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for up to two days. To keep them moist, place a paper towel inside the container to absorb any excess moisture. For longer storage, freeze your muffins. Wrap each muffin tightly in plastic wrap and place them collectively in a freezer bag. This method locks in freshness for up to three months.

When you‚Äôre ready to eat frozen bran muffins, thaw them at room temperature or warm gently in the microwave or oven. If you prefer, toast them lightly for an enjoyable crispy edge, adding a pleasant contrast to the soft, sweet crumb.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Enhancing Flavor and Texture Without Compromising Health

Adding mix-ins is a great way to customize your vegan bran muffins for both taste and nutrition. Consider incorporating chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans for crunch, or add raisins, dried cranberries, or shredded coconut for bursts of flavor and natural sugars. A pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg complements the sweet notes of dates and enhances the warmth of the bran.

Remember that each addition can affect moisture. For example, dried fruits soak up liquid, so you might need to adjust the plant-based milk slightly to keep the batter just right. Experiment with small batches to find the perfect balance for your taste.

By paying close attention to ingredient quality, mixing techniques, baking times, and storage methods, you‚Äôll master the art of making vegan bran muffins that are both satisfying and wholesome. These muffins deliver a generous dose of fiber with the confident sweetness of dates, making them an ideal snack or breakfast choice that supports digestive health and sustained energy throughout your day.

### Conclusion

Vegan bran muffins sweetened with dates offer a delicious and nutritious way to boost your fiber intake while satisfying your sweet tooth naturally. These muffins are packed with whole grain bran, which supports healthy digestion and helps keep you full longer. Using dates as a natural sweetener adds a rich, caramel-like flavor without the need for refined sugars, making these muffins a wholesome treat you can feel good about.

To get the best results, choosing quality ingredients is key. Opt for fresh bran, ripe dates, and plant-based milk to ensure your muffins have the perfect texture and flavor. Mixing the batter gently helps keep the muffins tender and moist. When baking, watch your oven closely to avoid overcooking, which can dry them out. After baking, proper storage is essential; keep the muffins in an airtight container at room temperature for a couple of days or freeze them for longer freshness.

Even if you have only as few days in Paris, I suggest that it's well worth the time to get into other parts of the city, particularly since the metro will get you anywhere inside the Peripherique in 20 minutes or less from the center.

My wife and I are US citizens and residents. We've visited Paris at least 20 times. We love the city‚Äîits culture, people, physical beauty, parks, public transportation, museums, churches, food, markets, shops, streets, smells ‚Ä¶ everything! (Except the gray, cold winters.) We‚Äôve visited all of the city‚Äôs 20 Arrondisements and about 3/4 of the 80 quartiers (4 per Arr.).¬†

This wasn‚Äôt by plan. Other than booking tickets in advance online to such things as the Louvre, Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, or performances, we *never* have an itinerary. That doesn‚Äôt mean we wander about ignorantly, however. We read constantly about Paris and enjoy consulting guidebooks and watching videos about the city. But when we‚Äôre there, our plan for any given day is based on the weather and what we feel like doing.¬†

As is well known, strolling for hours is the ideal way to experience Paris. We also use our Navigo passes for Metro and bus transport almost daily. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever taken a taxi, Uber, or Bolt in Paris. Also, we travel with carry-on luggage exclusively, whether for a few days or an entire month. We stay in typical 3-star tourist hotels or rent small apartments from Parisians we have come to know personally (not Airbnbs). You‚Äôd be surprised at how little we spend‚Äîmuch less than the vast majority of tourists.

On a typical day, we‚Äôll have a leisurely breakfast in the apartment‚Äîcoffee, croissants from the bakery down the street, fruit, and maybe a bowl of muesli with milk or yogurt‚Äîand muse about how we might spend the day. Then we head out, perhaps with a snack or picnic lunch. We often stay near one of Paris‚Äôs best streets for food, shopping, and wandering,¬†**Rue des Martyrs**. That‚Äôs not merely our opinion. The longtime Paris bureau chief for the New York Times, Elaine Sciolino, wrote an entire book about Rue des Martyrs and titled it ‚ÄúThe Only Street in Paris.‚Äù

We love them all. Standouts include Luxembourg Gardens, Tuileries Garden, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, Parc Monceau, Jardin de Plantes, Champ de Mars, Nelson Mandela Garden, Bois de Boulogne, and Bois de Vincennes.

**2. Museums**

**Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay**¬†is probably our favorite museum in the world. After visiting there, we sometimes stop at Sennelier, located on the Left Bank directly across from the Louvre. The shop has sold artist supplies for more than 130 years. Cezanne bought oil paints there. A few doors away is the residence where Rudolf Nureyev spent the last years of his life.

We also love the¬†**Louvre**, of course, and the¬†**Mus√©e Rodin**. Other favorites of ours are:

**Mus√©e Marmottan Monet**, in the 16th Arr. neighborhood of Passy. It houses the world‚Äôs leading collection of works by Claude Monet.

**Mus√©e Carnavalet**, an overlooked gem in the Marais‚Äîand it's free! The museum occupies two former mansions a block west of the Place des Vosges and displays a huge collection on the history of the City of Paris from neolithic until modern times. Explanatory signs are in English as well as French. It's the perfect place to spend an unseasonably warm afternoon, followed by a cool drink in the interior garden.

**Fondation Louis Vuitton**, which was designed by architect Frank Gehry and opened in 2014 on the site of a former bowling alley in the Bois de Boulogne. We visited it in 2023 to view a special Warhol-Basquiat exhibit and to experience the building itself. Afterwards, we strolled through the nearby **Jardin d' Acclimatation**¬†amusement park and down the Av. de la Grande Arm√©e to the¬†**Arc de Triomphe**. We continued down the¬†**Champs-Elysees**, visualizing Tour de France cyclists speeding up the cobblestones.

**3. Neighborhoods**¬†

We roam for hours in the¬†**Marais**. We often stop to get the obligatory falafel pitas on Rue des Rosiers and eat them in the¬†**Place des Vosges**. (Actually, we like the falafel pitas from the two Maoz locations in the Latin Quarter better. You get to put your own toppings on them there, and the staff are less rushed and friendlier.)¬†

We‚Äôve spent many brilliant days and drizzly ones in¬†**Montmartre**. Once, a visiting band from Sao Paulo, Brazil performed on the plaza just below¬†**Sacre-Couer**. The area around the Basilica is almost always packed with tourists, but if you continue down the backside of the hill and into the old village, it‚Äôs quite peaceful, particularly in the interesting¬†**Montmartre Cemetery**.¬†

On the Left Bank, the¬†**Latin Quarter**¬†and the nearby area of¬†**St. Germain des Pres**¬†are chock full of wonderful shops, cafes, historic sites, and churches‚Äîeven if they tend also to be chock full of tourists. The historic¬†**Place des Contrescarpe**¬†and¬†**Rue Mouffetard**¬†are worth strolling through and stopping at a caf√© for a snack and refreshment, perhaps envying the university students who are privileged to enjoy their days here.

We often walk along lovely¬†**Rue Saint-Dominique**¬†(in the 7th),¬†with its postcard view of the¬†**Eiffel Tower**, before heading up the¬†**Rue Cler**¬†market street to buy the makings of a picnic, which we have on the lawn in front of¬†**Invalides**.

We‚Äôve strolled through many of the city‚Äôs covered shopping passages, including¬†**Passage des Panoramas**, which is particularly interesting and historic, and¬†**Passage Choiseul**, where we sometimes have lunch in one of its restaurants.

We love the marvelous¬†**Rue Montorgueil**¬†market street. We make a point of stopping at Stohrer, which opened in 1730 and offers the finest house-made French pastries and chocolates.¬†

We‚Äôve walked the¬†**Promenade Plant√©e**, a 3-mile elevated linear park built atop an abandoned railway in the 12th. The High Line in New York City was inspired by this peaceful stretch of greenery within the bustling city.¬†

The neighborhood of¬†**Butte-aux-Cailles**¬†is tucked away on the edge of Paris in the 13th. It's virtually untouched by tourism and retains much of the charm of a small village. It‚Äôs a haven for young artists and creative types, with wonderful street art, cafes, and bars.

The¬†**City University of Paris**¬†is located at the far southern edge of the city in the 14th, but it‚Äôs only a 20-minute Metro ride from the center of town. The university sits between two lovely parks.¬†**Parc Montsouris**¬†is particularly peaceful and lovely, with not a tourist in sight.

**Belleville**, in the 20th,¬†is a lively, primarily working-class neighborhood that has long been a haven for immigrants, artists, and musicians. As you roam its streets (which are entirely safe, even if a bit gritty), you‚Äôll enjoy the ubiquitous, high-quality street art. You may also happen upon open-houses at art galleries or a raucous outdoor performance by a local brass and drum band, as we did.

**4. What about food?**

We‚Äôre vegetarians. Happily, Paris offers cuisines from all over the world, including ones that have lots of options for us. For example, many of the South Asian restaurants wedged between Gare du Nord and Gare de l‚ÄôEst are terrific, with high quality food and friendly service. Great Italian food may be enjoyed all over the city, as well as Greek, Lebanese, North African, and more.¬†**Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis**¬†(in the 10th) is packed with lively spots offering great food of this type at good prices. Head east of¬†**Canal St. Martin**¬†into the 11th, and you‚Äôll find many more. Meanwhile, classic French eateries typically offer dishes such as omelets, onion soup made with vegetable stock, ratatouille, and quiches. We love them all‚Äînot to mention all the superb boulangeries, patisseries, and gelato/glace shops all over the city. Lastly, there are a surprising number of very good vegetarian/vegan restaurants in Paris, especially in the 9th and the Marais. But we rarely go to them: there are simply too many other great choices.",33,1745693025.0,ParisTravelGuide,6,0.97,False

1k8jz6i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8jz6i,Fragrance Shop NYC Custom Fragrance Experience,"So today I went to the Fragrance Shop NYC to make my own custom fragrance. I'm a local but had never heard of this place until now. Their website says to call ahead to make an appointment but their instagram says they take walk ins. I called and got an appointment for an hour later. 

The shop is ADORABLE. I was surprised by how quiet it was considering it was a weekend. It was only me, the two employees and two other customers. I worked with Krista and she was amazing. They start you off by having you sniff all the oils they have: base notes, middle notes, top notes. It's about 40-50 scents total. You write down the ones that you like.

After you write down the notes you like you're given samples of the each of the groups to sniff together. You choose four base notes, three middle and two top. So for example I was given all six of the base notes I liked and I had to choose the four that I liked the best together. They have coffee to smell for cleansing and they have you go outside to smell the combinations in the fresh air. 

After picking the notes the employee starts to blend the oils together and has you smell the oil wet and dry (they have you rub the oil in very well to get a sense of the fragrance after the top notes fade). You go back and forth outside to smell the combination and decide which notes to bump up. 

Finally you pick your bottle/size and type of fragrance (oil or spray). I went for a 1/2oz oil because it was the cutest bottle. The price of this size was $92 and with tax and everything it was about $103. Finally you name the fragrance and they keep your recipe on file so you can always call for refills or a change from oil to spray, spray to oil. 

This was such a fun experience and I really enjoyed myself. The staff was lovely and the process was just wonderful. I felt so calm and welcomed in the space. The whole process took about and hour and fifteen minutes (I showed up fifteen minutes early and they took me early!). Although it was quiet today I would suggest going on a weekday or scheduling in advance if you want to go on a weekend to avoid crowds/waiting. 

Finally my perfume!

Base Notes: amber, pink sugar, sweet vanilla, woody smoke  
Middle Notes: rhubarb, violet, english pear wildflowers   
Top Notes: pomegranate, fig leaf bergamot

I named my perfume Ophelia after the painting by John William Waterhouse. It smells whimsical but intriguing. Like walking through a springy forest filled with secrets. My goal was a signature scent that I could wear in all seasons. The oil feels so nourishing and soft, no greasiness at all! It's also hair safe! I couldn't stop smelling my wrist on my walk home and the final product makes me smile so much. 

If you're a local or just visiting I HIGHLY recommend going to Fragrance Shop NYC. It was a truly magical experience and I would go back in a heartbeat. ",33,1745692814.0,Indiemakeupandmore,10,1.0,False

# Embracing Flexibility: Key Components of the Digital Nomad Lifestyle

Living the digital nomad life is about embracing flexibility and making the most out of technology to work remotely while traveling the world. But what does it really take to make this lifestyle work for you? Here‚Äôs a closer look at the key components that can help you transition smoothly into the digital nomad lifestyle.

[More about Digital Nomad](https://digitalnomadroutes.com/)

**1. Reliable Internet Access**

One of the most critical aspects of being a digital nomad is having access to reliable internet. Without a stable connection, it's challenging to meet deadlines or collaborate with team members. Many digital nomads invest in high-quality portable Wi-Fi devices or purchase local SIM cards upon arrival in new locations. Some also opt for co-working spaces that offer fast and secure internet connections.

|Location|Internet Speed (Mbps)|Recommended Device|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Chiang Mai, Thailand|50|Netgear Nighthawk M1|
|Berlin, Germany|100|TP-Link M7350|
|Porto, Portugal|70|Huawei E5576|

**2. Flexible Work Schedule**

A flexible work schedule is essential for managing time zones and personal productivity. Digital nomads often adapt their work hours to align with those of their clients or teams. For instance, someone working with a New York-based company might start their day early to overlap with peak business hours in the U.S. This flexibility allows for better communication and collaboration despite geographical distances.

* Set clear boundaries between work and leisure time.
* Create a routine that fits your personal rhythm.
* Use time management tools like Trello or Asana to stay organized.

**3. Portable Workspace Setup**

Having a portable workspace setup is crucial for maintaining productivity on the go. This typically includes a lightweight laptop, a good pair of headphones, and a reliable power bank. Some digital nomads also carry portable monitors or keyboards for enhanced comfort and efficiency.

|Item|Brand/Model|Price Range ($)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Laptop|MacBook Air|999 - 1499|
|Headphones|Sony WH-1000XM4|349 - 399|
|Power Bank|Anker PowerCore|30 - 50|

**4. Financial Planning and Budgeting**

Financial planning is another vital component of the digital nomad lifestyle. It involves understanding the cost of living in different countries, saving money, and setting up a sustainable budget. Many digital nomads use budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB to track expenses and plan for future travels.

* Research the cost of living in your destination cities.
* Open a multi-currency bank account for easy transactions.
* Consider setting up an emergency fund for unforeseen expenses.

**5. Cultural Adaptation and Language Skills**

Cultural adaptation and language skills play a significant role in making the digital nomad lifestyle fulfilling. Learning basic phrases in the local language can help build rapport with locals and enhance your travel experience. Additionally, understanding cultural norms and customs ensures smoother interactions and integration into new communities.

* Enroll in language classes before your trip.
* Join local expat groups to meet fellow travelers.
* Be open to learning and adapting to new cultures.

**6. Legal Considerations and Visa Requirements**

Understanding visa requirements and legal considerations is crucial for a seamless digital nomad journey. Different countries have varying rules regarding remote workers, and failing to comply can result in penalties or deportation. Researching visa options, such as the digital nomad visa programs in some countries, can provide peace of mind and legal protection.

* Consult with immigration lawyers for advice.
* Stay updated on changes in visa policies.
* Keep copies of important documents for easy reference.

**7. Health and Safety Precautions**

Maintaining health and safety is paramount when traveling frequently. Digital nomads should ensure they have adequate health insurance coverage, carry essential medications, and stay informed about local health advisories. Regular exercise and a balanced diet can also contribute to overall well-being while on the road.

* Purchase comprehensive travel insurance.
* Carry a first-aid kit and necessary medications.
* Stay physically active and eat nutritious meals.

By focusing on these key components, you can create a solid foundation for a successful digital nomad journey. Embracing flexibility, staying organized, and adapting to new environments are all part of the adventure. Whether you're just starting out or looking to refine your approach, remember that the digital nomad lifestyle is about more than just location‚Äîit's about freedom and choice. So, pack your bags, connect to the world, and enjoy the ride!

# Tools and Technologies Enabling Remote Work

As the digital nomad lifestyle continues to gain traction, the tools and technologies enabling remote work have become increasingly sophisticated. Whether you're working from a bustling caf√© in Bali or a quiet cabin in the Swiss Alps, these tools help ensure productivity and seamless collaboration with teams around the globe.

# Communication Tools

Effective communication is key to any successful remote work setup. Several tools have emerged to facilitate real-time conversations and project management. Slack, for instance, is a popular choice for team messaging, allowing users to create channels for different projects and topics. Microsoft Teams integrates seamlessly with Office 365, offering chat, video calls, and file sharing functionalities. For those preferring more traditional email, Gmail and Outlook offer robust features like calendar integration, task management, and collaboration tools.

# Project Management Software

Managing tasks and deadlines can be challenging when working remotely, but project management software helps keep everything organized. Trello uses boards, lists, and cards to visualize workflows, making it easy to track progress and delegate tasks. Asana is another powerful tool, offering detailed task breakdowns, timelines, and progress tracking. [Monday.com](http://Monday.com) provides customizable dashboards and integrations with other apps, making it a versatile option for managing complex projects.

# Video Conferencing Tools

Video conferencing has become essential for virtual meetings and presentations. Zoom remains a top choice due to its user-friendly interface and high-quality video and audio capabilities. It supports large group meetings, webinars, and breakout rooms for smaller discussions. Google Meet offers seamless integration with Google Workspace, providing secure video calls and screen sharing. Microsoft Teams also includes robust video conferencing features, making it a one-stop solution for remote collaboration.

# File Sharing and Storage Solutions

Efficient file sharing is crucial for remote workers. Dropbox allows users to store and share files securely, with versions available for desktop and mobile devices. Google Drive integrates with other Google apps, offering unlimited storage for Google Workspace customers. Box provides enterprise-level security and compliance features, making it ideal for businesses handling sensitive data. Microsoft OneDrive offers seamless integration with Office 365, ensuring documents are always accessible and up-to-date.

# Security and Privacy Tools

With the rise of remote work, ensuring data security has become paramount. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) like NordVPN and ExpressVPN encrypt internet traffic, protecting users from cyber threats. Password managers such as LastPass and 1Password help generate and store strong passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond just a password.

# Productivity and Time Management Tools

To stay productive while working remotely, tools like Pomodoro timers and time-tracking apps are invaluable. Toggl and RescueTime automatically track time spent on tasks, helping users identify areas for improvement. Forest is a unique app that encourages focus by growing a virtual tree for every uninterrupted period of work. Todoist simplifies task management with intuitive interfaces and reminders, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.

# Collaboration and Creative Tools

For creative projects, tools like Figma and Sketch enable real-time collaboration on designs. Miro is a versatile online whiteboard that supports brainstorming sessions and workflow visualizations. Adobe Creative Cloud offers a suite of tools for graphic design, video editing, and photography, all accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. Canva makes it easy to create professional-looking graphics, presentations, and documents without needing extensive design skills.

|Tool|Functionality|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Slack|Team messaging|User-friendly, integrates with many apps|Paid plans can be expensive|
|Trello|Task management|Visual, flexible, easy to use|Limited in-depth project management features|
|Zoom|Video conferencing|High-quality video, robust features|Data privacy concerns|

As the digital nomad lifestyle continues to evolve, these tools and technologies empower individuals to work effectively from anywhere in the world. By leveraging these resources, remote workers can maintain productivity, foster collaboration, and enjoy the freedom that comes with a location-independent career.

# Balancing Work and Travel: Strategies for Success

As a digital nomad, balancing work and travel can be both exhilarating and challenging. The freedom to work from anywhere in the world is a dream for many, but it requires careful planning and execution to ensure productivity and enjoyment. Here are some strategies to help you achieve a harmonious balance between your professional responsibilities and your wanderlust.

**1. Set Clear Boundaries**

To maintain focus and avoid burnout, it's crucial to establish clear boundaries between work time and leisure time. Define specific hours during which you will dedicate yourself to work tasks. Communicate these hours with clients or colleagues to manage expectations. For example:

|Day|Work Hours|Leisure Hours|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Monday|9 AM - 5 PM|5 PM - 9 PM|
|Tuesday|9 AM - 5 PM|5 PM - 9 PM|
|Wednesday|9 AM - 5 PM|5 PM - 9 PM|
|Thursday|9 AM - 5 PM|5 PM - 9 PM|
|Friday|9 AM - 5 PM|5 PM - 9 PM|

This schedule helps you stay organized and ensures you have ample time to explore new places and cultures.

**2. Choose the Right Tools**

Efficient tools can streamline your workflow and make remote work more manageable. Invest in reliable software and hardware that fit your needs. For instance, consider using project management tools like Trello or Asana to keep track of tasks and deadlines. Cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive can help you access files from anywhere. Additionally, a good Wi-Fi connection is essential; always check the internet speed before committing to a location.

**3. Plan Your Moves Wisely**

Planning your travels thoughtfully can minimize stress and maximize productivity. Research destinations that offer high-speed internet, comfortable working spaces, and a conducive environment for your work. Some popular spots for digital nomads include Bali, Lisbon, and Chiang Mai. Consider factors like local amenities, cost of living, and cultural attractions when choosing a destination. By planning ahead, you can ensure that you have a smooth transition from one place to another.

**4. Stay Connected**

Maintaining strong connections with friends, family, and colleagues is vital for your mental health and professional success. Utilize video calls, instant messaging apps, and social media to stay in touch. Regular check-ins can help you feel connected and supported, even when you're thousands of miles away. This also ensures that you remain visible and engaged within your professional network.

**5. Embrace Flexibility**

Flexibility is key to thriving as a digital nomad. Be open to changing plans and adapting to new environments. Sometimes, unexpected events can lead to better opportunities. Embracing flexibility can also help you manage unexpected challenges, such as unreliable internet connections or sudden changes in travel plans. Keeping an open mind and being adaptable can turn potential setbacks into positive experiences.

**6. Take Care of Yourself**

Maintaining physical and mental health is crucial for sustaining a productive and enjoyable lifestyle. Incorporate regular exercise into your routine, whether it‚Äôs yoga, running, or swimming. Eating well-balanced meals and getting enough sleep are also important. Consider activities like meditation or journaling to manage stress and enhance your overall well-being.

**7. Network Locally**

Networking is an essential aspect of professional growth. Engage with local communities and attend meetups or events. This can provide valuable connections and insights into the local job market. Platforms like [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) can help you find relevant groups and events in your area. Building relationships with other professionals can lead to new opportunities and collaborations.

**8. Document Your Journey**

Sharing your experiences through blogging, vlogging, or social media can be rewarding and can also help build your personal brand. Documenting your journey can inspire others and provide a record of your adventures. It can also serve as a portfolio of your work, showcasing your skills and achievements to potential clients or employers.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively balance your work and travel life as a digital nomad. Remember, the key is to strike a balance that allows you to enjoy the freedom of remote work while still maintaining a high level of productivity and engagement. With careful planning and the right mindset, the digital nomad lifestyle can be both fulfilling and successful.

# Overcoming Challenges: Common Pitfalls and Solutions for Digital Nomads

Embracing the digital nomad lifestyle can be incredibly rewarding, offering freedom, flexibility, and the chance to explore new places. However, it also comes with its own set of challenges. Understanding these common pitfalls and how to overcome them is key to making the digital nomad life work for you.

# Internet Connectivity Issues

One of the most common challenges faced by digital nomads is unreliable internet connectivity. Whether you're working from a bustling caf√© in Bali or a remote cabin in the Swiss Alps, having a stable internet connection is crucial. To combat this, consider investing in portable Wi-Fi hotspots or satellite internet options. Additionally, always have a backup plan, such as a local SIM card with data or tethering capabilities through your smartphone.

# Power Outages and Unstable Electricity

In some regions, power outages can be frequent, which can disrupt your workflow. Bring a high-quality power bank and a laptop battery extender. For longer stays, invest in a good UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) to ensure your devices remain powered during unexpected outages.

# Maintaining Productivity

Working remotely can blur the lines between work and leisure, leading to burnout or procrastination. Establish a routine and designate a specific workspace, even if it‚Äôs a corner of a hotel room or a cozy caf√©. Set clear boundaries and stick to a schedule to maintain productivity. Tools like Trello or Asana can help you manage tasks and deadlines efficiently.

# Time Zone Differences

Working across different time zones can be challenging, especially when collaborating with teams in other parts of the world. Use tools like World Clock or [Timezone.io](http://Timezone.io) to keep track of your team's schedules. Scheduling meetings in advance and setting clear expectations can help streamline communication and avoid delays.

# Staying Connected with Family and Friends

Maintaining relationships while traveling can be tough. Regular video calls and messaging apps can help you stay connected. Consider sharing your journey through social media or blogging platforms to keep loved ones updated. Planning visits home or inviting friends to join you occasionally can also strengthen these connections.

# Social Isolation

Loneliness is another pitfall of the digital nomad lifestyle. Joining co-working spaces, attending networking events, or participating in local meetups can help you build a community and combat feelings of isolation. Engaging in hobbies or sports can also provide a sense of belonging and fulfillment.

# Financial Management

Managing finances while living a nomadic lifestyle requires careful planning. Keep track of your expenses using budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB. Opening a multi-currency bank account can simplify transactions and currency conversions. Always have an emergency fund set aside for unforeseen expenses.

# Currency Exchange Rates

Fluctuating exchange rates can impact your budget significantly. Stay informed about currency trends and consider locking in rates when possible. Using credit cards with no foreign transaction fees can also save you money on international purchases.

# Legal and Administrative Hassles

Navigating visa requirements, tax obligations, and legal paperwork can be overwhelming. Research thoroughly before moving to a new country and consult with local experts if needed. Keeping organized records and staying compliant with local laws will prevent future headaches.

# Healthcare Access

Access to healthcare can be limited in certain areas. Purchase comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies. Research local clinics and hospitals in advance and keep a list of emergency contacts handy.

|Common Challenges|Solutions|
|:-|:-|
|Unreliable Internet|Portable Wi-Fi, Satellite Internet, Local SIM Cards|
|Power Outages|Power Bank, Laptop Battery Extender, UPS|
|Productivity Loss|Establish Routine, Designate Workspace, Use Task Management Tools|
|Time Zone Differences|World Clock Apps, Schedule Meetings in Advance|
|Staying Connected|Video Calls, Social Media, Co-Working Spaces|
|Financial Management|Budgeting Apps, Multi-Currency Bank Accounts, Emergency Fund|
|Legal and Administrative Hassles|Research Thoroughly, Consult Experts, Keep Organized Records|
|Healthcare Access|Travel Insurance, Research Local Clinics, Emergency Contacts|

By anticipating these common pitfalls and implementing effective solutions, you can make the digital nomad life more manageable and enjoyable. Embrace the adventure, stay proactive, and remember that each challenge is an opportunity to grow and adapt. With the right mindset and preparation, you can thrive as a digital nomad.

# Building a Community: Networking and Social Connections While Roaming

As a digital nomad, building a community can be one of the most rewarding aspects of your journey. It's not just about making friends; it's about forming connections that can enhance your work life, provide support during challenging times, and enrich your overall experience. Whether you're working remotely from a bustling city or a serene beach, here‚Äôs how you can network and build social connections while roaming.

# Networking Platforms

To start building your community, leveraging networking platforms is essential. Utilize LinkedIn to connect with professionals in your field. Join groups related to digital nomads, remote work, or your specific industry. Participate in discussions, share insights, and offer help to others. This not only expands your network but also positions you as an engaged and knowledgeable member of the community.

# Meetup Groups

Joining Meetup groups is another effective way to meet like-minded individuals. These groups often organize events tailored to digital nomads, offering opportunities to network and socialize. From co-working sessions to cultural outings, these events can help you connect with people who share similar interests and challenges.

# Co-Working Spaces

Co-working spaces are hubs where digital nomads converge. They offer more than just a place to work; they provide a platform to meet other professionals. Engage in conversations, attend workshops, and participate in networking events organized within these spaces. Many co-working spaces also host regular meetups, which can be excellent opportunities to expand your network.

* **Networking Events:**¬†Look for local networking events in the cities you visit. These can range from informal coffee meetups to formal seminars. Attending these events can introduce you to new contacts and potential collaborators.
* **Online Forums:**¬†Participate in online forums dedicated to digital nomads and remote work. Platforms like Reddit, Slack channels, and Facebook groups can be invaluable resources for finding advice, sharing experiences, and connecting with fellow nomads.
* **Local Coworking Spaces:**¬†When you arrive in a new location, check out local coworking spaces. Many spaces offer tours or open days where you can meet the members and learn more about the community.

# Building Relationships

Building relationships goes beyond just attending events. Here are some tips to foster meaningful connections:

* **Follow Up:**¬†After meeting someone, follow up with a message or email. Mention something specific from your conversation to show you were attentive and interested.
* **Offer Help:**¬†Be proactive in offering assistance. If someone mentions they need help with a project or task, offer your expertise. This can lead to reciprocal relationships down the line.
* **Stay Connected:**¬†Keep in touch with your new contacts through social media, messaging apps, or occasional emails. Sharing updates about your projects or asking about theirs can keep the relationship alive.

# Volunteering

Volunteering can be a great way to meet people and contribute positively to the communities you visit. Many organizations and events look for volunteers, and this can be a fantastic opportunity to meet locals and other digital nomads. Volunteering not only helps you build a community but also gives you a sense of purpose and connection to the places you visit.

# Community Projects

Participating in community projects can be a fulfilling way to integrate into the local scene. Look for initiatives that align with your skills and interests. For example, if you‚Äôre a graphic designer, you might offer to redesign a local non-profit‚Äôs website. These projects can lead to lasting connections and a deeper understanding of the culture and people around you.

|Event Type|Frequency|Location|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Networking Events|Weekly|Local Co-working Spaces|
|Meetup Groups|Monthly|City Centers|
|Volunteering Opportunities|As Needed|Local Non-profits|

By actively participating in these activities, you can build a robust community wherever you roam. Remember, the key is to be genuine and engaged. Your efforts to connect with others will not only enhance your digital nomad experience but also create a supportive network that can last a lifetime.

# Conclusion

As you dive into the digital nomad lifestyle, you'll find that embracing flexibility, leveraging the right tools, and balancing work with travel are essential. By navigating common challenges and building a supportive community, you can thrive in this dynamic world. Whether you're working from a bustling caf√© in Bali or a serene park in Paris, the key is to stay adaptable and connected. Remember, the journey of becoming a successful digital nomad is as much about personal growth as it is about career advancement. With the right mindset and strategies, you can make this lifestyle work for you, turning your travels into opportunities for both exploration and professional development. So pack your bags, connect with fellow nomads, and embark on an adventure that blends work and play seamlessly.",1,1745692793.0,digitalnomadlife,0,1.0,False

Have you ever wondered why your blood sugar levels seem to skyrocket after enjoying your morning coffee? Many people experience this puzzling phenomenon, and it can be both frustrating and concerning. While coffee is a beloved morning ritual for millions, its impact on blood sugar is more complex than you might realize. Understanding the intricate relationship between caffeine, insulin, and your body's metabolic response can help you better manage your blood sugar levels and enjoy your daily brew without unexpected spikes. click here to learn more: https://gluco6.myofferdeals.com

The Science Behind Coffee and Blood Sugar Spikes

Coffee contains more than just caffeine ‚Äì it's a complex beverage that can trigger multiple physiological responses in your body. When you drink coffee, several mechanisms come into play that can cause blood sugar levels to rise unexpectedly.

How Caffeine Affects Insulin Sensitivity

Caffeine has a significant impact on how your body processes sugar. **Insulin resistance** can be temporarily triggered by coffee consumption, leading to:

‚Ä¢ Reduced insulin sensitivity
‚Ä¢ Increased glucose production
‚Ä¢ Elevated stress hormone levels
‚Ä¢ Disrupted blood sugar regulation

Click here to learn more: https://gluco6.myofferdeals.com

The Role of Stress Hormones in Blood Sugar Elevation

When you drink coffee, your body releases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can cause:

1. Immediate glucose release from liver stores
2. Increased metabolic activity
3. Temporary insulin resistance
4. Heightened blood sugar levels

Important Factors That Influence Blood Sugar Spikes

Individual Metabolic Responses

Not everyone experiences blood sugar spikes the same way. Several factors contribute to how your body responds to coffee:

‚Ä¢ Genetic predisposition
‚Ä¢ Overall metabolic health
‚Ä¢ Time of day
‚Ä¢ Coffee preparation method
‚Ä¢ Individual insulin sensitivity

Caffeine's Impact on Different Body Types

Research shows that caffeine affects people differently based on:

‚Ä¢ Body composition
‚Ä¢ Existing metabolic conditions
‚Ä¢ Age
‚Ä¢ Overall health status

Managing Coffee-Induced Blood Sugar Spikes

Practical Strategies to Minimize Blood Sugar Fluctuations

To reduce unexpected blood sugar spikes after coffee, consider these expert-recommended techniques:

‚Ä¢ Consume coffee with a balanced meal
‚Ä¢ Choose lower-caffeine options
‚Ä¢ Monitor your body's response
‚Ä¢ Consider adding protein or healthy fats
‚Ä¢ Stay hydrated

Alternative Coffee Options for Blood Sugar Management

Not all coffee is created equal. Consider these alternatives:

1. Decaffeinated coffee
2. Half-caf options
3. Low-acid coffee varieties
4. Bulletproof coffee with added healthy fats

When to Seek Professional Advice

**Blood sugar management** is a complex issue. If you consistently experience significant spikes after coffee, consult a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance.

Understanding Your Body's Unique Response

While coffee can cause blood sugar spikes, it doesn't mean you must eliminate it entirely. By understanding your body's unique metabolic response and implementing strategic approaches, you can continue enjoying your favorite beverage while maintaining stable blood sugar levels.

Developing awareness and making informed choices will help you navigate the complex relationship between coffee and blood sugar. Pay attention to your body's signals, experiment with different approaches, and don't hesitate to seek professional medical advice if you have ongoing concerns.

Your morning coffee doesn't have to be a source of metabolic stress. With knowledge, mindfulness, and potentially some minor adjustments, you can enjoy your brew while supporting your overall health and well-being.

Remember, everyone's body is different. What works for one person might not work exactly the same for another. Continuous monitoring, understanding, and adaptation are key to managing your unique metabolic response to coffee.",1,1745692392.0,diabetessugarcontrol,0,1.0,False

I didn‚Äôt know they were in relationship,"Hey Reddit. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, so I'm just going to trauma-dump here like any normal person would.

I e-met this person online a little over three years ago. One random day, I got a notification that this person (someone I was a huge fan of, niche micro-celebrity level, but still a big deal to me) liked two of my posts. I was honestly starstruck because what are the ODDS that this person would like my posts? They must have actually gone through my account to like those posts, right? It was probably a miss-click, but still, my heart skipped a little.

Some time has passed, out of the blue they hit me up in DMs. I was so surprised, I thought, ‚ÄúIs this really happening?!‚Äù At first it was casual, just short conversations maybe once a week. Then it became more frequent. We started sending memes, songs, and random thoughts. They would send me selfies from their day, pictures of their meals, snaps from their messy room, even funny moments with their family and siblings, which, I don‚Äôt know about you, but that felt so personal. Too personal even lol.¬†

We would talk about everything. Work stress. Stupid internet gossip. Deep fears. Childhood traumas. Fucked up family drama. Future plans. Sometimes they would spam me with memes when they knew I was having a rough day. I remember once when they were bored at a family event, I joked, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? Just staring at them?‚Äù and they said, *‚ÄúNo, I'm staring at my phone texting you.‚Äù* Fair to say, talking to each other became part of our daily routine, and before I knew it, they became one of the closest people in my life.

There were nights when we stayed up texting about our dreams for the future, laughing until one of us said, ""Okay, okay, we really need to sleep now. It‚Äôs 5 AM, I have to get up at 8"" There were days when something funny would happen and the first thing I would think was, ""I can't wait to tell them."" I know this is silly since we only know each other online. But the way they would open up to me, made me feel like I‚Äôm actually closer to them. Naturally, since we text everyday and everynight, I consider them my best friend.¬†

One day something shifted for me. We were texting as usual, and they said they‚Äôre watching a movie and asked me to also watch it with them. We hit play at the same time and live-texted the whole thing. They would tease me about what scene was coming up. I would send them my reactions. We were texting and sending voice notes back and forth the whole time. It was *stupidly* cute. It felt like we were in the same room, side by side, sharing popcorn and laughing together. And somewhere in that night, I realized I had a crush on them.

I didn‚Äôt want to make it too weird, but still wanted to know if they‚Äôre single or not. So I asked about their dating life here and there. They said they were too busy to date, they wanted to focus on getting richer first. Whenever I tried to dig deeper, they always brushed it off. Though one day they finally talked about their past ‚Äútalking stages‚Äù, emphasis on *past*. But then they would say, ‚ÄúCan we change the subject :)‚Äù. So I assumed, logically, that they were single. They never mentioned seeing anyone. From their answer, they‚Äôre just not ready for a relationship since they want to have a stable career first, which is fair obviously. But maybe, just maybe, there could be a chance after all that settled.¬†

So I take this as a green light for me to start flirting with them, so they would notice that I am interested. I sent them good morning texts and good night messages. I hyped them up when they doubted themselves. I teased them and made them laugh on bad days. I cheered for every little win they had, no matter how small. (I mean, I already did that anyway, because we were friends prior to my feelings. But I made it more heartfelt, sweeter, more than joshing around. In¬† hopes that maybe they would feel it, maybe they would understand what I could not bring myself to say.)¬†

Their response? It was always hot and cold, so I had no idea what they were actually feeling. Sometimes they would flirt back, in a way that would make my heart racing. But sometimes they would leave me hanging, and I would just sit there, overthinking every word. I know I should have asked what his feeling was, but they once said they were planning to visit my city, and in my head, that became the perfect chance. I thought, *I'll wait. I'll tell them then. I'll confess when we meet face to face.* So I never told them my feelings. I waited, holding onto the hope of that meeting that never came. Plus, I thought we were building something.

Cut to a year later, everything feels normal, we‚Äôve grown even closer than ever. Until one day, I met with our mutual friend, so ofc they naturally come up in conversation. My mutual friend casually said,

""Yeah, they have been super busy, saving up for their wedding.""

I felt my stomach drop.

I laughed it off and asked, ""Wait, what wedding?"" thinking it was some kind of joke

But my friend just blinked at me and said, ""Wait, they didn't tell you?""

Apparently, they had been in a relationship for a year. And is now engaged. Planning a wedding.

They never told me. Not once.

They told me everything else. What coffee shop they‚Äôre in right now, How annoying their siblings and their family was being. Told me what they ate for breakfast. Told me when he was stuck in traffic. Told me when he bought new clothes, for God‚Äôs sake. But this? This life changing news? Nothing. Somehow, they forgot to mention they had a whole fianc√©e.

So from then, I just felt so lost. I thought all this time, I had more time.

More time to build up the courage. More time to maybe, be brave enough to tell them how I felt. 

But it was too late. They're engaged now and is getting married soon.

It just messed me up that all this time‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt tell me.

I know it‚Äôs technically none of my business. I know that. But tell me, Reddit, if you had a best friend, wouldn‚Äôt you want to share the happiest news of your life with them? Wouldn‚Äôt you want to celebrate together? Why tell our mutual friend, someone they‚Äôd only known for a year, and not me, who they knows longer?

It made me question *everythin*g. Were we even close? Were we even *friends*? What was all that flirting for? What was all the late-night texting, the selfies, the life updates, the teasing, the voice notes, the memes, the songs we shared, what was all of it?

It hurt. God, it hurt so much.

I hurt not just I know they were taken. I was more heartbroken that they hid it.

And deep down, I think I know why they didn‚Äôt tell me. They knew. They knew I had feelings for them. And they didn‚Äôt want to lose what we had. They knew that if I found out they were in a relationship, engaged, no less, they would lose me. Because of course they would. I would never keep flirting with someone who's taken. I would never keep sending flirty texts and racy memes to someone who‚Äôs promised to someone else. I would have pulled away immediately. Out of self-respect. Out of respect for their partner. I would have protected their relationship the way THEY should have.

But they didn‚Äôt stop me. They let me keep flirting. They let me stay. They let me fall deeper, while knowing the whole time that they had someone else.

And that made me furious. Because if you‚Äôre really serious about your partner, how can you let someone else get this close to you? How could you let someone keep crossing lines they didn‚Äôt even know were there? Even if their fianc√©e is the chillest, most non-jealous person in the world, it‚Äôs not about jealousy. It‚Äôs about basic respect. I would have stopped if I knew. I wish I had known.

And now...I just feel used.

Maybe they used me to fill some emotional void. Maybe I was just convenient. Someone who would always pick up the phone, always send funny memes, always know exactly what to say when they felt like the world didn‚Äôt get them.

Maybe I was just an easy audience for their highs and his lows. Someone who cheered a little too loud for their small wins. Someone who listened a little too closely when they needed to vent.

And the free labor too, *fuck*. I gave them my insights, my feedback, my ideas for their content. Every piece of advice, every suggestion, every hour spent helping them improve, all for free. And maybe they know if they told me they were in a relationship, they can‚Äôt get this anymore from me.

So they let me.

They let me pour pieces of myself into them, into their work, into their dreams, while knowing the whole time that they had a life, a future, being built with someone else.

They let me believe that I was special. That maybe, someday, I could mean something more.

But I was just... filling a gap. A placeholder. A distraction they didn't want to lose until they no longer needed it. Until they no longer needed me.

And realizing that, realizing I was only ever valuable when I was useful? God, it broke something inside me that I don‚Äôt even know how to fix yet.

So I started replying to their text slower. First, two days later. Then a week. Then I just stopped replying altogether. I know it‚Äôs not the healthiest way to handle things. But honestly? I‚Äôm tired. I need peace. And honestly, for the sake of their fianc√© too, I don‚Äôt want to be a part of their life anymore.

And for those of you wondering why I didn‚Äôt tell their fianc√©, well, because I don‚Äôt even know who they are, lol. And honestly? I don‚Äôt even think it *counts* as cheating? It just feels like betrayal in a way that words don‚Äôt quite capture.

And if I confronted them? I can already hear the excuses: ""Well, it‚Äôs none of your business whether I'm in a relationship or not."" ""Well, I never asked you to do all that for me."" ""Well, I feel like I never led you on.""

So yes, I am ghosting them. They made their choices. Now, I‚Äôm making mine. No explanation. No long text. No grand goodbye. Just silence. I don‚Äôt even want to give them the satisfaction of closure.

Some goodbyes don‚Äôt need to be spoken. They just need to be lived.

I choose to walk away without looking back. I choose to love myself louder than the silence they left me in.

It breaks my heart. Because I loved them. As a friend. Maybe something more. But I love myself more now

Things with L started going downhill last autumn, and during this winter things got worse. We just distanced ourselves from each other without any specific reason. 
I saw P at the local pub and we chatted for a bit. 

He was my boyfriend around 10 years ago, during my last years of high school. We broke up because we had different plans but he took it worse than I did. We were just kids, and haven‚Äôt really seen each other since then, he worked in a different city and we lost touch.

During the last 3 years we randomly met during some events in our local hometown, and things were never awkward, just friendly.

As mentioned, I saw P at the local pub not too long ago and he keeps popping up in my mind. Meanwhile, me and L broke up and a month after that while going for drinks with a coworker I texted L and we went for coffee. Talking to him felt like the most natural thing ever, we laughed a lot and talked about our lives. We met at a local party 3 weeks ago, we spend the evening together (with a group of people) and thats about it, there are some minor details but I don‚Äôt think they are relevant to the story.

Now, I texted him a week ago asking if he wanted to go for coffee, he said he was busy this week (the one which just ended) and we could maybe meet next week (so starting from tomorrow) but I kinda have the feeling he isn‚Äôt going to text me (I told him to let me know when he had time).

The thing is, I don‚Äôt know what to do even if he does text me - which I don‚Äôt think he will. 
Should I tell him I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him since we met at the pub? Should I let it go since he hasn‚Äôt really shown any interest? 
My friends tell me I should take some time to myself, I kinda agree since I haven‚Äôt been single in a while, although my last relationship ended unofficially last year and officially 2 months ago. 

I don‚Äôt think he has any interest in me, but what should I do? Would you want to know it if you were him?

She said throughout the next hour ""you owe me"" three other times throughout our conversation and I really thought she was joking. About a third of a drink was untouched and left from the cup. She put the dirty lid back on it and said she couldn't drink it because now there's a hair in it from the dirty lid . This made me believe she was joking even more . She got really upset throughout the event and left early. Fiber her behavior I'm actually starting to think she was serious and she expects me to buy her another $9 coffee. I can do that but I feel like she's sending mixed messages. Can somebody help me out on this social situation because I'm not sure I quite understand",12,1745691991.0,AutisticAdults,25,0.88,False

1k8jnjs,https://i.redd.it/xtuciv6h28xe1.jpeg,"Second trip, first solo","It's going to be a gorgeous night tonight and I'm ready to go! Here's my whole load (e-reader not pictured but it's coming along).

Total weight is about 28 pounds (12.7 kg). I'm (obviously) new to backpacking, so I'm making do with a lot of my car-camping and day-hiking gear while I decide what I do and don't like or need. The heaviest hitter by far is my tent. It's a ten-year-old REI Half Dome 2+ and with the body, fly, stakes, and poles it weighs in at 5 pounds 6 ounces (about 2.4 kg). I've ordered a Durston X-Dome 1+ which will be less than half the weight, but it won't be here until June. My pack itself is also pretty heavy (4 pounds 11 ounces, about 2.1 kg) but it fits me so well and is so comfortable it practically carries itself.

Luxuries I'm including are a chair, the aforementioned e-reader, and a lantern/string light combo which also doubles as a powerbank. The weather will be cool and the hike is less than 3 miles, so I'm not bringing a change of clothes, just a set of lightweight sleep clothes. The campsite is a hike-in site at a state park; they keep a stocked woodshed out there so I'll be able to enjoy a fire tonight. There's a water spigot and a pit toilet as well so I kinda feel like I'm only barely roughing it, but I think it'll be a nice, gentle introduction to solo backpacking.

Dinner tonight will be couscous with pouch chicken and some carrots; breakfast tomorrow will be instant coffee, oatmeal, and some dried apricots. I'm also bringing Fig Newtons and roasted chickpeas for snacks. No bears here, but the main campground in the park has nuisance raccoons. I don't know if the backcountry raccoons are pests too, but I'm bringing some cord to hang my food bag tonight just in case. 

I'm a little nervous. I'm not new to camping, and I've solo hiked hundreds of miles (many of them at this park), but I've never camped solo. I feel prepared, though, and I'm looking forward to getting out there! I'll be in my favorite park, at my favorite time of year in that park, in one of the darkest-sky parts of the state. It's gonna be a good night. üèïÔ∏è",18,1745691969.0,backpacking,1,0.96,False

Does it make the copper toxic?","I bought my parents a Moccamaster some years ago with the idea that if it's cleaned properly it'll last a lot longer than the cheap drip machines they keep buying.

When I was using and cleaning it, I'd use the Durgol stuff that Moccamaster recommends, but I haven't used the machine in years.

Noticed it doesn't really look like they're doing much to clean it, so much residue from leftover coffee. Then my mum used citric acid to descale it, told me the Durgol ran out a while ago and she used citric acid in the past.

But the Moccamaster website says to *not* use citric acid, and that if you have, you can clean it with a soda solution, and that citric acid voids the warranty. So she put the soda in it afterwards.

https://www.moccamaster.eu/blog/post/how-maintain-moccamaster

> do not use (organic) descaling agents based on citric acid, as this results in a lasting bad taste of coffee because the acid is aggressive and starts a chemical reaction with the copper heating element.

To me that just sounds like it ruins the taste of the coffee, but isn't particularly dangerous? I've been trying to Google it and almost *everything* I've read actually recommends using citric acid to clean copper. So what's with Moccamaster calling it ""aggressive""? Is it somehow stripping a protective layer or is this just some sort of fear mongering to get you to buy the Durgol? Everything else I've read says that copper *does not* react to citric acid, and some of the Reddit/forum posts I've read have similar confusion over this.

1k8jk1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1k8jk1v/trying_to_figure_out_if_im_going_crazy/,Trying to figure out if I‚Äôm going crazy.,"I‚Äôve been married to my husband for four years, known him for six. 

We met on Hinge, and we were young. 22 and 21. I had gotten out of a relationship a year and a half prior with a man who was manipulative and loved to stonewall me that I had known since I was 16, and was ready to date. He was in therapy for social anxiety, told me he was attending a church we both had similar views on, etc. 

He took me to antique malls, coffee shops, did arts and crafts. Said he only hiked once a year (I‚Äôm a big indoors girl), never mentioned how obsessed he was with sports or how much he pretty much hated all the things I love. Reading? He hates it. Writing? Art? Music? No no no. He said he did those because he wanted to spend time with me, not because he enjoyed them. He led me to believe he liked the activity as well. We have nothing in common now. We get engaged, and then, his very compassionate, funny personality slooooowly turns into joking ‚Äújabs‚Äù, and he gets more‚Ä¶I guess the word would be blas√©?

We got married, and got covid on our honeymoon. I‚Äôm chronically ill, and it made my health take a DIVE. The premarital counselor was telling him, hey, you KNOW you‚Äôre marrying someone who‚Äôs chronically ill. Are you prepared for that? He swore yes. He made me promise to get my license and a full time job by the time we married. Got my license. But I had zero energy for full time after I got Covid.

I work part time and he decided to go back to school at 25. We moved cities, and once we were further away, he started getting worse. Irritable, more jabs. Holding it over my head that I didn‚Äôt have a full time job. I‚Äôm trying to not fall asleep at the wheel from my chronic exhaustion, but that‚Äôs just an ‚Äúexcuse.‚Äù 

List of things he‚Äôs done, and responses that make me feel crazy:

-he hates stuff on his side of the bed. I forgot to take the small plastic from a vitamin bottle off, and he tossed it on my face instead of in the trash. But he said I was in a playful mood, and he never would have done it if he knew it would‚Äôve upset me. (I was laying down getting ready for bed. Not in a playful mood. Also, who likes trash thrown on their face?!)

-he lied and said he actually changed his mind about church and what he likes. He uses his social anxiety as an answer for e v e r y t h i n g. 

-says he‚Äôs too tired to help cook. Or clean. I do the laundry, I fold it I clean it. I cook, I do the grocery shopping. He won‚Äôt get gas in my car if he takes mine and I‚Äôm low because he doesn‚Äôt like getting out and doing it at night, it makes him nervous. (He‚Äôs a white man.) 

-he thinks supplements (that have physically shown improvement for me) don‚Äôt work. And if my doctor says hey, slow down, or anything he doesn‚Äôt agree with, he says if you pay a doctor enough, they‚Äôll tell you anything you want to hear. (That‚Äôs NOT how that works???)

-used to have anger issues but said he got over them with therapy. He‚Äôs recently stopped going. 

-he agreed to marital counseling regretfully. 

-we were play fighting and he tapped my cheek. I immediately stopped and asked if he just hit my face and he said he‚Äôs done it before. I said no you have not, he SWORE he had and never would‚Äôve if I hadn‚Äôt been okay with it.

He gets moody, depressed, he‚Äôs INSANELY insecure and will cry if I give any feedback. He cries if we argue and blames me for the poor sleep he gets, or crying on the bus or in class. He chooses to walk 2 miles home after school instead of the bus, and then says he‚Äôs too tired to help with any chores, and that his school is his work. (He‚Äôs doing 20 credit hours. Bare minimum, no work.)

He says I‚Äôm the one that‚Äôs never satisfied with what he does for me, the sacrifices he makes, (going to the dr with me when I was afraid because i have health PTSD from childhood experiences, and I was texting my mom the updates and not thanking him enough.) 

I‚Äôll tell him things that hurt me, and he acts surprised and says ‚Äúoh, sorry, I wouldn‚Äôt have said that if I would‚Äôve known it would hurt you.‚Äù But it‚Äôs such blatantly painful things? Like how WOULDN‚ÄôT it hurt me? 

And heaven forbid I need help. He heavily sighs, says how much he does and I don‚Äôt appreciate it or him and that he‚Äôs just not perfect enough when that‚Äôs how I feel about HIM. Like nothing I do is enough.

Oh, and he has a porn addiction he didn‚Äôt tell me would affect us. So abstinent for a year because ‚Äúmy fear of pregnancy needs to be worked through with my therapist.‚Äù Uh, no. Im just in an apartment without a clear future so I don‚Äôt want to add a baby into that?? And he refuses condoms because he can‚Äôt keep it up. I‚Äôm afraid to gain weight because he calls fat women whales. 

Any advice or words are welcome. I‚Äôm 28 and feel like I‚Äôm 50. I‚Äôm so tired. 

Edit: my therapist I‚Äôve had for 6 years said she didn‚Äôt flag it because she‚Äôs not 1. His therapist, and 2. She isn‚Äôt specialized in it. But she thinks he is a covert narc. My psychiatrist ABSOLUTELY thinks he is, but I am way too terrified to tell him that‚Äôs my worry. ",1,1745691710.0,NarcissisticSpouses,9,1.0,False

1k8jfui,https://www.reddit.com/r/fsbo/comments/1k8jfui/how_to_sell_fsbo/,How to Sell FSBO,"As many of you know, I sold FSBO in late March. And I had a very successful approach using a few methods. I am happy to share why I chose FSBO over an agent and why I like traditional FSBO over a Flat-Fee service in another post, if you'd like the answers. These are the steps I follow in preparation of listing my home for sale. The below items are the things you should do before choosing to hire a real estate agent or going FSBO. This is your prep work:

* **Start going to open houses**. This will help you to see what comparable homes are currently on the market. You will see what upgrades they made to the home, how they staged in preparation for sale, and help you figure out pricing of your own home. This will also help you decide if it's worth upgrading your home before sale. You might think about updating light fixtures, upgrading appliances, remodeling a bathroom, painting the inside of your home in neutral tones to give it a fresh look, etc.
* **Declutter**. I cannot say this enough. If you have lived in your home a long time, you have probably also collected a lot of unnecessary stuff that you do not want to have to move to your new home. Create piles of things you want to: throw away, give away, or store away so that it's not in the way when selling. Do not use your garage as storage space, unless you have intentions of storing it neatly in bins against a wall, so that potential buyers can actually walk in and see what your garage looks like. A home inspector is going to need access to the area as well. Remove anything on top of surfaces and store away (coffee pots, air fryers, picture frames, etc.). Decoration here and there is fine. But you want to create as neutral of environment as possible for potential buyers to feel as though they can picture themselves living in your home.
* **Deep clean.** No one is going want to buy a dirty house. You can hire a company to do a deep clean, but honestly, I think your family and you would do a better job. Clean walls, molding, corners where cobwebs may be, etc. If you have carpets, I would seriously consider changing them over to LVP if it's within your budget. It is a cleaner look for potential buyers and it's easier to keep your home clean when selling. Don't forget about the outside of your home. Make sure you have curb appeal. If you need to hire someone to trim/prune some trees/bushes, just do it. And make sure the outside of your home and walkways are power washed and gutters are cleaned.
* **Staging**. Do not buy anything to stage your home. Use the furniture you have available to create a minimalist look so that rooms appear bigger than really are and it makes rooms feel bright and welcoming.
* **Pets**. I have four dogs. I love them. I do not love their hair, and neither will a potential buyer if they are in your house while you are trying to sell. Trust me. When I walk into a house and I see cats and kitty litter, I immediately walk out. Why? Cats don't always use the kitty litter. And if there are beautiful hardwood floors underneath your carpet, chances are that cat's urine ruined them. I know because my parents unknowingly bought a house that had cats living there. My dad had to replace the hardwood floors that were damaged by cat urine. He found the hardwood floors when he went to rip up the carpet. Board your pets and find a kind family member to house them so they will not get in the way of being able to sell your home. One of my siblings had my parents take her animals so she could sell her house. I had to board mine, since I don't have family close by to help.
* **Pre-inspection**. I never had an agent tell me to do this. Most will tell you not to. You are selling FSBO. The only person who will know you did a pre-inspection of your home is you. I loved having one done because I was able to get ahead of any issues. After the inspection was done, I sat down with one of my friends and we reviewed it together. I decided to hire a plumber, electrician, and HVAC specialist to repair/replace any issues that were found on my report. Doing these things in advance saved me from having to offer any concessions. And I didn't find anything worrisome. If I had, I would have figured out if it was worth fixing or pricing my home accordingly and disclosing. Knowing me, I probably would have just fixed whatever it was so that I wouldn't have to disclose.
* **Appraisal**. If you have finished prepping your home for sale there are a couple of ways to handle the appraisal. You can have agents come and talk to you while also asking that they provide you with a CMA (Comparative Market Analysis). I strongly suggest this because they will try to scare the hell out of you and make you feel that you are far too incapable of doing this on your own. And their tactic almost worked on me. It really did. I had to call friends for moral support. I actually had one agent yell at me. Take a few deep breaths, vent, and then sleep on it. When you wake up in the morning and play back the things that were said to you, realize that they wouldn't be this pushy and underhanded if they didn't think they could sell your home. And if they can sell it, so can you. Now that you have your Comparative Market Analysis make sure you also hire a certified real estate appraiser. What I've found with agents is that they are supposed to give you a CMA and then talk to you about market trends and where they think your home should be priced. The certified real estate appraiser will compare you home to homes that have sold in the last 3-6 months and then compare your home offering credits where they think your home is better for lack of a better word. For instance, they may give you additional credits for your home having a larger lot, higher quality materials used on the outside of your home (fiber cement siding vs vinyl), or hardwood flooring over carpet, etc. Credits can also be taken away if another home offer higher quality than yours. From there, the certified real estate appraiser gives their opinion on what they believe the value of your home is. Why is this important? When I naively went to hire a real estate agent to list my home, I interviewed three agents. All of whom wanted to undercut the market by listing my home under value to drive a bidding war. Without hiring the certified real estate appraiser, I wouldn't have known that the agents planned to list my home $70k less than what a real estate appraiser told me my home was worth based upon his opinion. I ended up selling that home for full asking price in less than two weeks. My first offer was $30k under list and my second offer was full asking. Those agents couldn't guarantee that my home would have sold for well over $70k to make up for the commissions I would have had to pay out. Appraisals are not always accurate, so be careful when reviewing them. u/Ykohn was nice enough to explain the appraisal I received for the sale of my second home. He is incredibly knowledgeable. I would encourage you to join his weekly calls.

This is the stuff your agent is supposed to do and/or remind you to do. However, I know you can do it yourself and be successful in selling your home. After all, you got through the hard part.

* **For Sale Sign**. Now that you either created a for sale sign or received one from somewhere else, you will need a holder. I loved this one so much that I used it twice [Amazon.com: Real Estate Yard Sign Metal H-Frame, 18 x 24 Slide-in with (2) Riders, Black (Pack of 1), C 290 : Office Products](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0947G2CVV?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3&th=1) along with this: [Amazon.com: 6 Pack Bundle of Real Estate Rider Signs 6x24"" - FOR SALE, OPEN HOUSE, SOLD, COMING SOON, SALE PENDING, NEW LISTING - Double-Sided Waterproof Corrugated Plastic Made in America (Red Letters) : Office Products](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S8DF2QF?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1)
* **Attorney**. You will need one whether you choose to go FSBO or not. I found mine by asking others. I tried googling FSBO attorneys in my area. And although the law firm stated on their website that they handled FSBO, it was clear by talking to the attorney that they did not. Ask others. I went on the Next Door app and Facebook group for my town and just asked if anyone knew of attorney who specialized in FSBO. I called three and narrowed it down to one firm that I wanted to use. They also provided the disclosure forms I'd need to use to be compliant.
* **Professional Photographer**. I did this a few different ways. I went on Zillow and started looking at comparable homes. If I found photography I liked, I found the floor plan and looked at the small writing on the bottom of the plan that gave the business name of the photography company. An then I infiltrated real estate groups and asked for references. Has anyone used this company before? Do you like their work? Is there someone else you'd recommend? The photographer I chose was so good that I had an agent call to tell me I had the best photos he had ever seen for an FSBO and asked if I would be willing to share the name of the company. When I told him, he said he knew the company but they had fallen off his radar until he saw my photos. Photography companies will also provide floor plans for an additional fee. DO IT! It is worth it because no one is going to take the time to read your listing description (I don't). I want to see your floor plan, so I know where rooms are located. I do not like the virtual tours. They hurt my eyes.
* **Picture Day**. I am anal retentive about everything. I am a ridiculous perfectionist. I had my home professionally cleaned the day before picture day and stayed at a hotel that night to keep everything perfect. I went back by myself to make sure the cleaners did a good job and cleaned where they missed. I made sure all blinds/curtains were pulled up/over and out of the way to allow natural light shine through and made sure all surfaces were clean and rechecked bedding (I bought neutral dog-hair free bedding for my son's room, since he insists the dogs sleep with him.). I turned on every single light in the house, including under kitchen cabinets. I turned the fireplace on so it would be active during photos. And I paid for the extra stuff like aerial views of the amenities and neighborhood, video to be used on Zillow and social media. I did not set the kitchen/dining room tables as advised. I had packed most of the good stuff away. But you may consider doing that to give a lived-in feel to your photos. For more information on how to prepare, I have provided a link to my photographer's photo shoot prep work: [McNamara-Photography-Preparation-List-8\_2022.pdf](https://valueabode.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/McNamara-Photography-Preparation-List-8_2022.pdf). The photographer could not have been kinder. He actually sold his own home FSBO.
* **Paperwork**. If you made it through the above, then you are almost ready to list your home. But you will need a few things. Make sure those disclosure forms are filled out. Create a word document that has all your utilities and service providers. You will have to provide this information before closing, anyway. If you did any recent renovations, such as, new HVAC units, roof, water heater, etc., have those warranties ready to show if asked for them. Also, call those companies to see if the warranties are transferable because it is an excellent selling point for your home. If you live in an HOA, you will need to provide those documents as well. Although not required, I would create marketing materials on your home for your open house. I had a two-sided flier which contained all upgrades/renovations that had been done to the home and when along with community information and who I use for utilities and vendors to keep my home well-maintained.
* **Videos**. If you do decide to have video done on your home, you are going to have to upload it to YouTube or some site that will allow you to post videos to share with others.
* **Listing**. When you list FSBO, you will need a yard sign. I strongly suggest listing with saveonyourhome.com. Why? Because it's a free site and u/ykohn was nice enough to provide me with a free yard sign which had a QR code to my very own personalized listing. And I saw a few people stop in front of my house to grab the listing, which was very cool! It was not only advertising for my home but also for his company. I couldn't be happier to do it because I have very much enjoyed joining his weekly calls and helping answer other FSBO questions. Plus, he has been great about helping me, too. The other thing that I LOVED about his site is that I could see he repeat and unique visitors to my listing. Full disclosure: I get nothing for recommending the site. I really did think that I would need the site to setup showing requests. I also listed on [forsalebyowner.com](http://forsalebyowner.com), which received no traction. I didn't think it would as the platform is not user friendly at all. I also listed on Zillow FSBO, which is where I believe I received the most traction.
* **Commissions**. Be prepared for this question as it will come from both unrepresented buyers and buyer agents. Just say, ""I am open to all offers."" And you will get pushy people. Agent: ""My clients want to see your home, but only if you are offering my 2.4% commission. Otherwise, they will pass."" You: ""I am open to all offers."" Unrepresented Buyer: ""Since I do not have an agent, are you offering a discount?"" You: ""I am open to all offers."" If they pressure for an answer, ""I am not prepared to offer anything upfront without having a formal written offer."" You do not have to negotiate hypotheticals. The one unrepresented buyer wasn't even interested in my home, since she wanted a master bedroom on the first floor. Do not negotiate hypotheticals. It is a waste of everyone's time and energy.
* **When to List?** My research told me April-June (depending on where you live and when schools open/close and typically on Thursdays, but from experience from listing on Thursday, I think Friday is your best bet to drive urgency. I also listed the same weekend that my neighborhood was having a neighborhood wide yard sale, which I think also drove traffic to my open house. I submitted my FSBO listing to Zillow on a Friday morning, but I had to stay on top of them to approve it by Friday evening to make sure it went live to show that I was having open houses on Saturday and Sunday. In less than 24 hours, I had two people working on submitting an offer from out-of-state and a few agents calling to setup appointments for their clients. The one agent could not schedule a showing for her clients until Tuesday. When I told her I was having open houses that weekend, she asked if I would tell her if I had any offers because her clients really wanted the house. During my open house, the agent's clients told me that while I was talking to their agent, one of their mom's called to tell them she drove passed my house and that I was having an open house. Their pushy mom made them dive from 90 minutes away to see my house while their agent was on vacation. They were truly a lovely couple. The husband asked if he could look up into my attic while they were there. They asked lots of questions. I told them about the walking trails throughout the neighborhood. They asked if they could stay a little bit just to walk around the neighborhood. The wife came back later without her husband to tell me that she and her husband knew as soon as they walked in that they really wanted my home. I told her I still had my Sunday open house, three private showings, and other offers that I was waiting on. The couple's agent waited until after the weekend when I confirmed that all best and final offers would be accepted Monday evening. Despite getting one better offer, I renegotiated their offer a little bit. As much as they wanted my house, I wanted them to get it, too. And their agent has been lovely to work with, which was a nice surprise from my last home sale.
* **Open House Prep Work**. Remember those marketing materials I told you to make? You will need them now, along with some other stuff. I used Canva to create my open house announcement for social media. If you send me a private message, I am happy to send what I made as an example. I also bought these open house signs from Amazon. I love them because they are BIG and what other agents use. [Amazon.com : 14 Pack 24 x 18 Inch Open House Sign Double Sided Real Estate Sign Posts Plastic Heavy Duty Directional Yard Mark with Left Right Arrows 14 Pcs H Metal Stakes(Red) : Patio, Lawn & Garden](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BB68QX8M?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1). I also bought feedback forms, which came with a doorknob accessory to let people know they walk right in: [Amazon.com: Juvale 2 Pack Sign in Book for Open House Visitors, Guest Registry with 2 Pack Realtor Tent Cards for Real Estate Agent Supplies, Home Sale Business (Navy Blue, 8.5x11) : Home & Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L8TL81G?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4). It let's you know who came to your open house and allows them to leave feedback about your home which helps you figure out the positives and negatives to your home.
* **Marketing**. You should have made a Canva open house sign to use for Facebook. You have to be very careful and strategic as to how you do this because Facebook will block you from posting your open house after you post it in 15 groups on the same day within a few hours. Your open house announcement should contain Saturday and Sunday open houses if you plan to do two in one weekend. I posted that announcement and attached the video created by the photographer's company of my home. And these are the Facebook groups where I posted it:
   * Moving to <insert name of state>
   * FSBO groups for my state, county, town, and surrounding areas. Be careful if you use a flat-fee listing agent, you are not allowed to post in in FSBO groups, at least not in the groups I belong to.
   * Real estate groups for my state, county, town, and surrounding areas
   * Your town's Facebook Group
   * Your neighborhood Facebook Group - Someone is always listing their home for sale in case someone knows someone. And someone even post when a friend of theirs wanted to move to our neighborhood.
* **Offers**. I submitted all offers to my attorney to review once I had them all. Once he told me everything was pretty standard in the contracts and I all I really needed to do was pick one, that's when I went back to negotiate with the agent whose clients I wanted to get the house, as long as they would agree to pay their own agent. Their agent called me and said that she spoke to her clients and said she would walk away from deal so they could get the house. Since they wanted her to represent them, the agent renegotiated her commission from 2.4% down to 2% and asked if I would split the commission with her clients. I obliged.
* **Inspections**. Remember when I told you to get a pre-inspection done? The agent told me that her inspector said my home was the best maintained home he had ever seen for its age. Damn right it was! But the agent shot herself in the foot. Her clients asked for $1,500 in concessions. Under normal circumstances, I probably would have agreed. But I put so much work into this house to make it perfect that I declined the request with that explanation. I knew her clients weren't going to walk over $1,500. Plus, I still had agents calling to ask if I'd accept backup offers. I wasn't worried.
* **Post-inspections**.  You made it! You are that much closer to closing. Now is the time to cofirm the closing date is still on schedule and start transferring warranties to the new homeowner, if you have any. This is also when the agent will ask for a list of your utilities, which you already provided during your open house and again once you were under contract.
* **Closing paperwork**. Hopefully, you have stayed in close contact with your attorney. I only bothered him when I had questions, which were few. Your attorney will make an appointment with you to sign all paperwork, unless you choose to go to closing.

This was a lot of information to digest. I think I covered everything. If I did not, let me know what I missed and I will add it into this list. So many people have questions. And they shouldn't feel lost, intimidated, or pressured into using an agent or flat-fee listing broker because they didn't know enough about FSBO. I think the above is easy. Others don't. Am I wrong to keep stating that selling is easy? If you have any questions, I will always be here to answer them. I don't know everything. But I think we have a pretty good group of people who can really help along the way. And u/yKohn I believe is still holding weekly calls for those who have questions.",2,1745691406.0,fsbo,2,1.0,False

Can I get some advice before the bad luck fully kicks in? ('M30 'F22),"I seem to have walked into a cultural standoff, and I‚Äôm definitely losing.

Quick background: I'm ('M30) a chronic whistler. I whistle when I'm happy, when I'm bored, when I'm stressed... basically, if I'm breathing, there's a tune coming out. Literally whistled as I was writing this post.  
  
My girlfriend ('F22), who is Romanian, warned me early on that in her culture, whistling indoors is bad luck. I thought she was joking. She wasn‚Äôt. Apparently, whistling inside is basically inviting financial disaster, heartbreak, and probably a few angry spirits for good measure all at once.

Now, every time I whistle while making coffee or doing any menial task, she looks at me like I‚Äôm juggling broken mirrors under a ladder. I‚Äôve *tried* to stop. Honestly. But breaking a lifelong habit is harder than it sounds, it‚Äôs like trying to forget how to blink.

So here I am, fighting my own instincts, trying to respect her beliefs, and losing badly.

1k8jc0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTableCentral/comments/1k8jc0i/can_loryergo_lett01b_tv_tray_revolutionize_your/,Can LORYERGO LETT01B TV Tray Revolutionize Your Home Setup Review Reveals All Details,"**Flexible Design and Multipurpose Usability**  
The LORYERGO LETT01B TV Tray is a surprising gem for anyone in need of a multifunctional piece of furniture. I‚Äôve been using this TV tray daily for the past few weeks, and it has seamlessly adjusted to my routine. It‚Äôs not just a TV tray‚Äîit‚Äôs a workstation, a dinner table, and even a makeshift study setup for my nephew when he visits. Measuring 20.4 inches wide by 15.5 inches deep, it offers ample space to hold a variety of items. There's even a built-in 3-inch cup holder, which has saved me from spilling my coffee more than once. Its modern black finish pairs effortlessly with the sleek style of my living room, never looking out of place.  

**Adjustable Height and Tilt for Maximum Comfort**  
Comfort is where this TV tray truly shines. The height is adjustable to six settings between 20.4 and 28 inches tall, making it incredibly versatile. Whether I‚Äôm slouching on the couch or sitting upright, I can adjust the tray to the perfect height. The three tilt angles are another bonus; I often keep it at a gentle 30¬∞ upward tilt when eating or 23¬∞ downward when reading from my tablet. It feels like this TV tray was designed with ergonomic ease in mind, adapting to just about any seated position without a fuss.  

[Check LORYERGO LETT01B price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b088db5v13/)  

**Sturdy Construction with Enhanced Stability**  
One thing I didn‚Äôt expect from the LORYERGO TV Tray was how sturdy it feels for something so light. Weighing just 6.53 pounds, it‚Äôs easy to move around the house, but thanks to the crossbar stabilizer at the bottom, it doesn‚Äôt wobble around like cheaper models tend to do. I‚Äôve even placed my laptop and a plate of food on it simultaneously without worrying about it tipping over. This stability makes me trust it more, especially around my curious cat who loves jumping onto things!  

**Quick and Hassle-Free Assembly**  
Putting this table together was an unexpectedly smooth experience. It comes with the instruction manual, hardware, and even an Allen key, which means I didn‚Äôt have to hunt down any tools. From opening the box to setting it up, the whole process took about ten minutes. For someone like me, who dreads complicated furniture assembly, this was a massive win.  

**Space-Saving and Easy Storage Options**  
What makes this tray even more appealing is its foldable design. Once you remove the stabilizing rod, the table unit collapses flat to just 2.1 inches. I‚Äôve found it incredibly convenient to slide it under my couch when it‚Äôs not in use. With limited storage space in my apartment, this feature genuinely feels like a lifesaver. It‚Äôs also a great reminder that even functional furniture can be compact and easy to store.  

**Highlights**  
- Adjustable height and tilt with six height levels and three tilt angles.  
- Lightweight design coupled with enhanced stability from the crossbar stabilizer.  
- Effortless assembly requiring no extra tools.  
- Foldable and compact for easy storage under furniture.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Of course, no product is without its drawbacks. While the LORYERGO TV Tray excels in many areas, there are still some aspects that could be improved:  
- The surface, while smooth and easy to clean, has a somewhat unfinished feel to it and might not withstand heavy scratches.  
- The cup holder is great for standard cup sizes, but anything larger doesn‚Äôt fit well, which could be limiting for some.  
- While folding is straightforward, removing the stabilizing rod every time can feel slightly tedious.  

**Competitive Options to Consider**  
While I‚Äôve enjoyed this TV tray, I‚Äôve used a few similar products in the past. One competing option I tested was the Table-Mate II, which offers a similar range of height adjustments but lacks the stability provided by the LORYERGO crossbar. It tends to wobble a bit and doesn‚Äôt feel as secure when holding heavier items. Another option is the Winsome snack table set, which has a more premium wood finish but lacks tilt flexibility and the essential cup holder. Compared to these products, the LORYERGO TV Tray strikes a perfect balance between functionality, stability, and ergonomic design, especially for a modern apartment or multipurpose use.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering its thoughtful design, stability, and versatility, the LORYERGO LETT01B TV Tray offers excellent value. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, its features, such as the adjustable height and the tilting angle, justify the investment. For anyone who needs a reliable and customizable tray without taking up much space, this product feels worth every penny.
