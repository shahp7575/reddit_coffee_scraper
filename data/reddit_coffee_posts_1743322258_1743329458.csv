Although it has in fact ruined my life for over four years making me like a knocked out duck, not being able to work or socialize. I had my suspicions two years ago back and forth but didn‚Äôt think it was that bad and that I still could have decaf coffee, tea and matcha. Because I could still fall asleep. But apparently not. This was a silent sleep depriver.



To me, caffeine works as poison. Not directly, but it inevitably ruins my sleep and therefore my ability to function, live and increase risk for diseases with chronic sleep deprivation.



I have misunderstood myself, and I‚Äôve been misunderstood. What was thought to be psychological issues like depression or social anxiety wasn‚Äôt psychological - it was sleep deprivation. Of course I‚Äôm not feeling joy when my body physiologically doesn‚Äôt have the ability to produce enough energy. Of course my mind is blank during conversations and I want to isolate myself because I am freaking sleep deprived and groggy.



I used to be a vibrant kid that loved making movies, being with friends, doing sports and being active. I still love that, but spend my days laying down on the couch instead. I don‚Äôt have energy to even have conversations or sit upright. Speaking of walking, that doesn‚Äôt happen without getting lactic acid. And the overeating, I never feel really full.



No one understands because I don‚Äôt have a diagnosis and no printed proof on a paper. But at least I came to realize this now. Even though I missed out on my teenage years, it‚Äôs better now than later. I think it‚Äôs crazy that it‚Äôs not common knowledge about potential negative effects on caffeine. I couldn‚Äôt even get professional help with this, suffering for years.

(pet as in animal pet(?,"not sure if this goes under submod question or discussion, or question(? if i need to change the tag pls informmme

but like, this is a 5 a.m. thought. pls bear in mind my only coding experience is rlly basic html, some pseint and jvs and doing jsons(? so im not sure if this is a dumb/impossible idea for MAS. also im on 3 hours sleep and 2 cups of coffe so idk if  my brain will work the english lenguage well enought to be understable

so, w the selectors submod you can add spritepacks that are statics, would it be possible to add like a background pet? like a dog or something that.

Like, while afk monika goes changing her poses in (i believe) a random order (sometimes she gets different facial expressions too, like the sparkle eyes sometimes happen while not being in a dialog), or how her coffee put gets empty from full, so would there be possible to repeat that on something else outside the base MAS mod? 

I mean, a kind of easy way i can think of making this is by using the default body sprite parts(? like her eyes png, and edit the pngs to have some pet png image too(? but the problem would come that it might be over /in front of something else from a different spritepack and look weird(? or it would be kind of fun the dog teletransport from one place to another XD, tho a kind of mini animatic could be made playing w the png of her eyes blinking and then opening

going back to making it a submod ah, like i know the png images of the pet would be in the layer over the background images, but under the rest of the sprites. I remember that in pseint you could make some variable to be a random number (but in this case it would limited to the determined poses, like number 1 is pose 1 were the dog sitting at the left, num 2 is pose 2 w the dog taking a nap, etc), and i think (if i didnt dreamt it) you could make said random number follow a sequence(? if it is possible then in the submod it would be possible to make like an animatic/animation of the cat running around, like:

if random-number: sprite 1, then follor sprite 1b, and then sprite 1c, etc until reaching sprite 1e and then go back to asking for a new random number to start a different sequence that is a different animatic. Like, the sprite 1 section is the dog running around, section 2 is the pet moving while napping, section 3 is the pet eating from their food vowl or something liket that

  
this is a random idea i had while looking at a rlly cute cat bed(? i was like ""mmm i wonder if moni would like a pet"" and boom my brain started working XD, i even kind of feel inspired to star looking on how to make a submod, tho in a later future since my classes started lol (and im atm in 2 courses to learn front end design and another of UI design, so no more new lenguages for me this year XD), tho i might try the idea of drawing my dog on the eyes or arms sprites (oof i will have to start studying animal anatomy, im kind of excited by this idea)

Adam nodded slowly. He didn‚Äôt answer. He stood, crossed to the room, and pulled the blind back just enough to look out. The street was quiet, the bus stop out front had no one waiting at it.

‚ÄúI hate feeling like a ghost,‚Äù he said, almost to himself.

Billy stayed quiet. Just let it linger. After a breath, Adam let the blind fall back into place.

He knelt down at the box. Turned over the photograph. Vivienne, smiling over her shoulder in the kitchen, her ruby hair looked like romance itself. Boxes still sitting on the benches ready to be unpacked from the move.

He placed down it face up and closed the box again.

The kitchen used to smell like coffee grinds and garlic. Vivienne always cooked barefoot, hair pulled up, music playing low from the turntable. He saw her there now, dancing between bench and stove, humming along to a Miles Davis.

She turned, smiled. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch the sauce.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were.‚Äù

She kissed his cheek anyway.

They ate on the floor, surrounded by boxes they promised to unpack tomorrow. Her wine glass left a ring on the floorboard. They didn‚Äôt care. She rested her head on his chest, her finger tracing the line of his jaw. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go quiet on me,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here,‚Äù he said, exhaling softly.

Chapter 1: From you, the beginning of an understanding

‚ÄúAnd that, class, is why the rules of thermodynamics are universally true. Any questions before we wrap up?‚Äù

The room was silent‚Äîan expected reaction from the freshmen on their first day. It was a joy to see their awe, the gears of understanding just beginning to turn. A few students whispered to each other, but no one spoke up.

After dismissing them, the only sounds that could be heard were the sound of shuffling backpacks and the sponge sliding across the board, erasing any remnants of equations and diagrams.

However, as the last of the students left, I heard a hesitant voice call for me from behind. ‚ÄúProfessor?‚Äù

I glanced over my shoulder to see a young man lingering by the desk, his shoulders slightly hunched. His expression was a mix of curiosity, unease, and uncertainty.

‚ÄúSomething on your mind?‚Äù I asked, curious but patient.

‚ÄúWell, In these lessons, we learn deeply about how the world works.‚Äù he began, ‚ÄúBut, I was wondering‚Ä¶ Do we need to?‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt we just live by experience?‚Äù

The question gave me pause. I leaned against the desk, considering my response.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fair question,‚Äù I said, meeting his gaze. ‚ÄúExperience is valuable, but it‚Äôs limited. Think of it like this‚Äîif you understand how things work, you‚Äôre not just following the rules. You‚Äôre learning how to challenge them, improve them, and even break them when necessary. It‚Äôs like using a tool versus designing a better one. Without understanding, we‚Äôd never progress.‚Äù

He nodded slowly, his eyes distant as if chewing over the idea. ‚ÄúThanks, Professor.‚Äù With that, he walked back to his friends.

As I packed up my materials, I found myself lingering on his question. Maybe it resonated more than I cared to admit.

The walk home was uneventful at first, the rhythm of my steps blending into the quiet hum of the city. On a whim, I decided to try out a new caf√© that had opened nearby. After all, caffeine will be something that I‚Äôll need to get used to, now that summer is over and lessons have started once more.

The streets were eerily quiet in an unusual way. The caf√© itself was empty, the soft jazz playing inside the only sign of life. I ordered a coffee and sat near the window, watching the streetlights flicker on as dusk crept in. 

There was a playground just across the street, its swings now rusted and its slide coarse under years of neglect. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile faintly as I glanced at it. A long time ago, my friends and I used to play there, our laughter carrying on the wind like a song. It was a time of freedom‚Äîa time when the world felt bigger and brighter than it does now.

Back then, there were stories‚Äîold ones, whispered by elders and carved into fading books‚Äîof a power that once shaped the world. Magic, they called it; but we didn‚Äôt think much of it as kids. 

Leaving the cafe, I walked through the park. It was autumn. The falling leaves, rich in hues of amber and crimson, blanketed the ground, attempting to hide the harsh grayness of the cityscape. The cold wind carried them through the streets, their rustling a fleeting whisper against the imposing concrete and steel buildings.

I was reminded of one day when, on my way home from school, I encountered an old woman with bright blue eyes sitting alone on a park bench. Her face, weathered yet serene, looked as if it held secrets the world had long forgotten. She spoke of times of the extraordinary, her voice soft but laced with a kind of knowing.

On another day, she showed me faded photographs of a young man with whom she‚Äôd shared countless adventures. His face was adorned with a pair of mystical purple eyes. 

Œóers sparkled as she spoke of him, her words weaving tales of love and daring exploits that defied fate itself. Together, she said, they had written their own story, bending destiny to their will.

Smiling, as I sat at the bench she used to sit on, I tossed my empty coffee cup towards a nearby trash bin, aiming it like a basketball shot. As expected, I missed it. I stood up and crouched to retrieve it. That was when I was pulled out of my reverie.
¬†
Something‚Äîor I should say someone‚Äîcaught my attention. Looking at the reflection on a puddle near the fallen cup, I caught sight of a dark silhouette perched atop a nearby building, its gaze unmistakably fixed on me. It radiated an aura so deadly I impulsively felt the need to run. Immediately, I turned around. But nothing was there. I stared at the puddle again, but it reflected only my face.
¬†
Listening to my instincts, I went straight home, forgetting even to throw the cup in the bin. I was, for the first time in years, extremely hyper-vigilant, taking notice and being suspicious of any movement around me. Unconsciously, I walked at an almost jogging pace.
¬†
I looked warily both before and after I entered my house and locked the door. But that weird feeling couldn‚Äôt wear off. I was so tense that I even forgot to sit down. I just stood, looking left and right, in a state of complete uncertainty and disorientation.

After some time, I regained my composure and decided to calm down. After all, why would someone stalk me? It is very possible that he just coincidentally happened to look in my general direction. But despite any attempt at logically approaching the situation, my instincts were still going off.

I tried to shake off the unease by turning on the television, hoping the noise would drown out my thoughts.

As a mindless commercial flickered across the screen, I slumped back in my chair, the memory of that moment replaying endlessly in my mind, not letting me rest.
¬†
It was then that I was shaken from my thoughts by a sudden interruption, the voice on the television changing.
¬†
""...and this is why, to become a true master, you must never stop learning. The world is more than what we can see; it‚Äôs what we understand and how we apply that understanding,‚Äù the figure on the screen said.
¬†
I blinked, sitting up straighter. The man speaking seemed to be a self-proclaimed magician. Leaning closer to the screen, I became more sentient of the man‚Äôs looks. He seemed vaguely familiar‚Ä¶ As if he was someone I met very recently‚Ä¶ But I could not remember who he was. 

‚ÄúWait a second,‚Äù I muttered, the words slipping out unbidden. That hair‚Ä¶ those purple‚Ä¶ clouded eyes. There was no mistaking it‚Äîonly one person I‚Äôd ever seen had those one-of-a-kind eyes.

The realization hit me like a jolt, and his words suddenly carried a weight I couldn‚Äôt ignore, as if they were meant for me‚Äîespecially after everything that had happened today.
¬†
‚ÄúA magic user,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúis not someone who merely casts spells. We are students of the world, students of its energy, its forces, and its fundamental truths. The true power of magic lies not in raw power but in the understanding of the world around us‚Äîhow its forces bend, twist, and flow through everything, even the very fabric of existence itself.‚Äù
¬†
I had heard this before; but never so powerfully. Understanding‚Äîthat was the key. It was what made one capable of transcending the ordinary and changing the world in ways most couldn‚Äôt even comprehend. It wasn‚Äôt just a tool, as I told my student, but also a bridge to everything else.
¬†
I sat there for a moment, still caught between the vivid image of his figure and the unsettling events of the day.
¬†
It was then that I heard faint footsteps from the door. In my shock, I stood up. Immediately, my mind ran off thinking of the various possibilities. Most of them, however, contained a single common point: the fact that I was being followed.

Remaining faithful to that one part of me that believed that everything was just a coincidence, I decided to approach the door.
¬†
After five steps, however, both the feeling of sound and touch of my foot disappeared. Just like when one tries to walk more steps than there are, I felt as if I was sinking through the ground. Looking down I noticed a black hole that was below me, seemingly pulling me in.
¬†
In a last-ditch effort, I grabbed whatever was closest. But my hand couldn‚Äôt bear the weight of my accelerating body and I fell in.
¬†
Soon, I was consumed by an endless black space. The only thing I could see were my hands dragged by the air. Desperately I looked around, hoping I could recognise anything.

Just like a constant pain that the brain dulls, I was feeling numb in my five senses. The whistling and drag of the air as well as the feeling of my clothes ceased to exist. I tried to scream, but not even a whisper was heard. It felt like swimming through a viscous liquid, my mind adrift and alone, severed from the anchor of a body.

That was until a white light began to seep in, slowly displacing the darkness. It grew brighter and brighter until it engulfed everything, overwhelming me. I tried to close my eyes, but there were no eyelids‚Äîno body left to make it possible.

Just as slowly, the light faded, plunging me back into darkness. But this time, faint voices echoed all around me, disjointed and unclear.

Where was I? And why was this happening?

As if responding to those questions, I forced myself to focus. Releasing the tension in what should have been my closed eyes, I willed them open once more.

After focusing, I was looking at a ceiling made out of wooden beams.

Then the voices were back, this time more clear and loud ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt he be crying?‚Äù

Panic surged as I tried to move, but my limbs felt alien‚Äîsmall, chubby, and weak. I stared at my hands, the realization hitting me like a thunderclap.

These weren‚Äôt my hands.

I wasn‚Äôt me anymore.

The truth was unbearable, and yet, there was no escape. My frustration erupted in the only way that was felt as natural: a wail, the sound sharp and pitiful.

‚ÄúThere, see? I told you he‚Äôd cry eventually,‚Äù the woman said, her tone warm and reassuring.

My gaze shifted back to the pair to my right. It was a man and a woman who seemed so overjoyed by my presence. Their smiles radiated a love so genuine it almost felt invasive, like a warmth I didn‚Äôt know I was missing.

I wanted to reject it all, to scream that I didn‚Äôt belong here. But as the woman cradled me, wrapping me in a familiar warmth I hadn‚Äôt known for years, the fight drained from me.

For now, I let myself drift into sleep, my questions unanswered, my fate uncertain.

I've known this former coworker for about 10 years at this point i think, maybe a little longer. We talked on breaks frequently and when i was abruptly let go in 2022 she was rather disappointed  and was interested in not losing contact.

A year later i  reach out again and we meet for coffee. We end up talking for about 4-5 hours leaving only because she had to feed her dog soon. Time flies i guess. Anyway, im not that much of a confident individual (at least then i wasn't. i am improving but still not super confident) and i didnt hug her goodbye or anything. I just said bye and walked off to my car and was instantly hit with a wave of emotions. Like i screwed up royally. I messaged her and she said she had a good time. We haven't met up since. Ideas were considered but due to scheduling or other reasons never happened. Last time i messaged her was over a year ago because she posted something somewhat depressive on facebook and i wanted to check on her. I would like people to check up on me when im not doing well so i did what i thought was right. No response. She isnt really on social media much, maybe once a month she'll post something typically from instagram.

She was single when we met for coffee (i found out during and i didnt hug her or anything because i thought she might think i had ulterior motives for the catch up also due to lack of confidence i didnt really know what to do so i played it super safe; probably too safe). I've liked her for years but i always thought she had a boyfriend until she subtly hinted that she didnt have one. I should mention i saw her friend on some dating apps, swiped out of curiosity, never matched. I think i did that before the coffee meet as well and it was never brought up.

##‚Äå The ‚Å¢MSR ‚Å£Guardian: A ‚ÄåSuperior‚Å¢ Water Purification Solution

Before delving into the specifics of protecting your MSR Guardian, let's briefly recap why it‚Äôs considered a top-tier choice for water purification. The MSR Guardian‚Å£ isn‚Äôt‚Å§ just a ‚Äåfilter; it's a purifier. This means it not ‚Äçonly removes bacteria and protozoa but also viruses, providing a higher level of‚Äç protection than manny standard water filters. This becomes especially crucial when dealing with ‚Äåwater sources where contamination is a ‚Å§meaningful concern.Designed for demanding environments and frequent use, ‚Å§the MSR Guardian boasts impressive flow rates and a self-cleaning system, making‚Å£ it a favorite among backpackers, ‚Å§international travelers, and preparedness enthusiasts alike. It's ‚Å¢a robust piece of ‚Äçgear engineered to deliver‚Å£ peace of mind.

## understanding the ‚ÄçImportance of a prefilter

Now, let's talk ‚Å¢about‚Å¢ the unsung hero of water filter maintenance: the prefilter. Think of your MSR Guardian filter as a complex machine. You wouldn't run a car's engine without an air filter,would you?‚Äå Likewise,using your MSR Guardian without a prefilter is like ‚Äçinviting‚Å¢ trouble. A prefilter's primary job is simple: to remove larger particles like sediment, silt, algae, and organic matter ‚Äç*before*‚Äç they reach the‚Å¢ main filter element. This‚Äå seemingly ‚Å¢small step has a massive ‚Äãimpact on preserving the filter's lifespan and‚Å¢ maintaining its optimal performance. Ignoring this step can lead to msr guardian filter clogging, reduced flow rates, and ultimately, a much shorter lifespan for your expensive filter.

Essentially, a water filter prefilter for backpacking and travel acts as the first line of defense. By ‚Å£trapping larger debris early, you considerably reduce the burden on the MSR Guardian's internal ‚Äãfilter, allowing it to focus on removing the microscopic ‚Å§nasties that can make you sick.

[[Explore Top Rated msr filter guardian on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=msr filter guardian)
## When is a Prefilter absolutely necessary?

The need for a ‚Å¢prefilter‚Äå becomes ‚Å¢non-negotiable under specific circumstances:

*   **Turbid‚Å£ Water sources:** If your water source resembles muddy soup more than ‚Å£a pristine stream, a prefilter is essential. High‚Å¢ turbidity, or cloudiness caused‚Äå by ‚Å§suspended particles, is a filter's worst ‚Äçenemy.
*   ‚Å£**High Sediment Levels:** Rivers and lakes near construction sites, agricultural areas, or after heavy rainfall are likely to have high sediment loads. ‚Å§Without a prefilter, the MSR Guardian will struggle.*‚Äç   **Algae Blooms:** During warm months, algae blooms can‚Äç occur in stagnant water. ‚Å§These blooms‚Å¢ can quickly clog any filter, making prefiltration a must.
*   **Prolonged Use in Challenging Environments:**‚Äå If you're embarking on a ‚Äçmulti-day backpacking trip or traveling to regions with ‚Å§known water ‚Äçquality issues, consider a prefilter as a standard part of ‚Äçyour water purification‚Äã setup.

[[Explore Top Rated msr filter guardian on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=msr filter guardian)
## Choosing the‚Å¢ Right Prefilter for Your MSR Guardian

Not all prefilters ‚Å§are created ‚Äãequal. Selecting the ‚Å§right one depends on the water conditions you anticipate encountering and your specific needs. Here's a breakdown of common prefilter types and their suitability for the‚Å§ MSR ‚ÄåGuardian:

*  ‚Å§ **Inline Prefilters:** These prefilters connect directly to the intake hose of your MSR Guardian. They are relatively‚Äå simple to use and offer good filtration for‚Å£ general‚Å¢ sediment and ‚Å£particulate matter. They require‚Äã some modification to attach,‚Å§ and the msr guardian filter prefilter will add some length to your intake tube.
*  ‚Å£ **Wrap-Around or‚Å§ Stocking-Type Prefilters:** These are simple mesh or ‚Å¢fabric sleeves that you place ‚Äãaround the intake ‚Å§of the ‚Å£filter.‚Å£ These are suitable ‚Äãfor cleaner water ‚Äåsources‚Äç with ‚Å§only minor sediment issues. The msr guardian replacement prefilter ‚Å£of this type is typically inexpensive and easily ‚Äåreplaced.
*   **DIY Prefilters:** Some users ‚Äãcreate their own ‚Äçprefilters‚Äã using readily available materials like coffee filters or fabric. while this‚Äç can be a cost-effective option, it's crucial to ensure that the materials are safe for potable water and don't introduce‚Å§ any contaminants of their own. Pore size is also a key consideration when developing your own solution.

Things to consider when choosing the best prefilter for msr guardian:

*   **Micron Rating:** This indicates the size of particles the prefilter can remove. ‚ÄåA lower micron rating means finer filtration. (e.g., a 5-micron prefilter will remove particles larger than 5 ‚Äãmicrons). For the MSR Guardian, a prefilter with a micron rating‚Å¢ between‚Å£ 50 and 100 microns is generally sufficient for most situations.
*   **Flow Rate:** Check ‚Å¢the prefilter's ‚Å§flow rate‚Å§ to ensure it doesn't significantly impede the MSR Guardian's pumping ‚Äåspeed. A slow prefilter can ‚Å§negate the advantage of the Guardian's‚Äå rapid flow rate.
*   **Material:** Look for prefilters made from durable, food-grade‚Äã materials that ‚Å§won't leach harmful chemicals into your water.
*   **Ease of Cleaning:** A prefilter that's easy to clean and maintain is essential for prolonged use in the field. If not cleaned, a‚Å§ prefilter can collect debris and prevent ‚Äçproper flow to the MSR Guardian.

While MSR doesn't specifically‚Å¢ sell a prefilter *designed* for the‚Äã Guardian, ther are 3rd ‚Å¢party options ‚Äãand‚Å¢ many ‚Äçsimple ‚Å§generic pre-filters that ‚Å§can be adapted. An ""msr‚Äã water filter‚Å§ protection"" strategy relies ‚Äåon choosing a durable product that‚Äôs easy to clean and won‚Äôt break down in backcountry conditions.

## Step-by-Step Guide to‚Å¢ Using a Prefilter with Your MSR Guardian

Here's a simple guide to effectively using a prefilter with your MSR guardian:

1.  **Assess ‚ÄåYour Water Source:** Before pumping, visually inspect the water source. If it appears heavily turbid or contains visible debris,consider ‚Äãusing a bandana or cloth to filter the largest particles *before* using‚Äç your prefilter.
2.  ‚Å¢**Attach the prefilter:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions for attaching‚Äå the‚Äã chosen prefilter ‚Äçto the MSR Guardian's intake hose.Ensure a ‚Å§secure connection to prevent‚Å§ leaks or bypass.
3.  **Submerge the Intake:** Place ‚Äçthe intake hose‚Äã with the prefilter into the water source, ensuring that it's not‚Å§ resting directly on the bottom, where sediment is frequently enough concentrated.
4.  **Pump Slowly ‚Å§Initially:** Begin ‚Äåpumping slowly to allow the prefilter to gradually trap sediment and prevent clogging.
5.  **Monitor the Prefilter:** Periodically‚Å£ check the prefilter for clogging. If‚Å¢ it becomes heavily clogged, remove it and clean it thoroughly‚Å£ before continuing.[[Explore top Rated msr filter guardian on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=msr filter guardian)
## Cleaning‚Äã and Maintaining Your Prefilter: A‚Äã Critical Step

Cleaning your prefilter regularly is just as important as using it in ‚Äãthe first place, specifically for extending the msr guardian filter life. A clogged prefilter not only reduces flow‚Å£ rate but can also become a breeding ground for bacteria. Here's how to properly clean your ‚Å¢prefilter:

1.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** After each use, rinse‚Äã the prefilter thoroughly with clean water. Backflushing the prefilter (forcing water through it in the opposite direction of normal flow) can help dislodge stubborn particles.
2.‚Å£  **scrub Gently:** If rinsing isn't sufficient,‚Äç gently scrub ‚Å§the prefilter with a soft‚Äå brush to remove any remaining debris. Avoid ‚Äãusing harsh soaps or detergents,as they can leave ‚Äãresidues that may contaminate your water.
3.‚Å§  **Disinfect Periodically:** For added hygiene, especially after using the prefilter ‚Å¢in questionable water sources, disinfect it periodically by soaking it in a diluted bleach solution (1 part bleach to 50 ‚Äãparts water) for 15 minutes. ‚Å¢Rinse thoroughly with potable water after disinfecting.
4.  **Dry Completely:** Before storing, ensure the prefilter is ‚Å§completely dry to prevent mold ‚Å¢and mildew growth. Air-drying in a well-ventilated area is ideal.

By adopting these cleaning procedures, the ""guardian water purifier‚Å£ pre-filter"" will ‚Äçcontinue ‚Å§to perform effectively.

## Essential ‚Å£MSR Guardian Filter Maintenance

Beyond prefiltration, proper maintenance is crucial for maximizing the life and performance of your MSR Guardian. Many users search for ""msr guardian filter maintenance"" facts, reflecting a desire to preserve their investment. Consider‚Å§ these maintenance practices:

* ‚Å§  **Regular Backflushing:** the MSR Guardian features a self-cleaning function that helps to clear the‚Å§ filter ‚Å§membrane. Engage this function regularly, especially after filtering turbid water. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper backflushing technique.
*   **Visual Inspections:**‚Å¢ Inspect the filter element regularly‚Å§ for damage ‚Å§or excessive wear.If you notice ‚Äçany cracks, tears, or significant discoloration, it's time to‚Å¢ replace the filter.
*   **Proper Storage:** When not in use,store the MSR Guardian in a ‚Äçclean,dry place,away from direct ‚Å¢sunlight‚Å§ and extreme ‚Å§temperatures. If storing for an extended period, ‚Äçensure the ‚Å§filter is completely dry to prevent mold growth.Some users recommend storing the filter in a container with a desiccant to absorb any residual moisture.
*   **Freezing Temperatures:** The MSR Guardian is designed to withstand freezing ‚Å£temperatures. However, it's still best to avoid prolonged exposure to freezing conditions, as ice crystals can damage the filter ‚Å¢membrane. If the ‚Äãfilter does freeze, allow it to thaw completely‚Äç before use and inspect it for any damage.

## Addressing MSR Guardian Filter Clogging

Despite your‚Å¢ best efforts, ‚Å£""msr guardian filter ‚Å¢clogging"" can still occur,‚Äå especially when ‚Äåexposed to extremely‚Å£ dirty water. Here's how to address a clogged filter:

1.**Backflush Thoroughly:** Attempt to clear the clog by backflushing the filter several times, ‚Å£following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. ‚Å§ **Inspect the Prefilter (If ‚Å§Used):** If you're using a prefilter, remove it and clean it thoroughly. A clogged prefilter‚Å§ can restrict water flow and make it seem like the main filter is clogged.
3.  **Warm Water Soak:** ‚ÄåSoaking the filter in ‚Äçwarm (not hot) water‚Å£ for a few minutes can help to loosen any accumulated debris.
4.  **Gentle Cleaning:** In certain specific cases, you might potentially be able to gently clean the filter element with a ‚Å§soft brush. Though, be extremely careful ‚Äãnot to damage the ‚Å¢delicate membrane.
5.  **Consider Replacement:** If ‚Å£the clogging persists despite your efforts,it's likely time to replace your MSR Guardian‚Å£ filter element. Continuing to use a severely clogged filter can compromise its effectiveness and possibly expose‚Äã you to unsafe water.

## Traveling Internationally: Enhanced Protection is Crucial

When traveling internationally, the risks ‚Å£associated with contaminated water are often higher. ensuring ""msr water filter protection"" is even more critical in these situations. Here‚Å£ are specific considerations for international travelers:

* ‚Äã  **Assess‚Äã Local Water Conditions:** Research the water quality of your‚Äã destination country before you travel. This will help you determine the level of‚Äã pre filtration and maintenance required.
*   **Carry Spare Prefilters:** Pack extra prefilters ‚Äãto ensure you always‚Å£ have a clean‚Äã one‚Å¢ available.
*   **Consider a Secondary Treatment Method:** In areas with extremely questionable water sources, consider using a secondary treatment method in addition to the MSR Guardian, such as water purification tablets or a UV sterilizer.
*   **Educate Yourself:** Learn about common waterborne illnesses and how to prevent them.

I felt safe and calm whenever I lied on you and listened to your heartbeat. You told me you loved me but you were not sure if I was the girl you would settle down with. 

And I told you I loved you and I envisioned myself building a family with you someday. You didn't know yet I knew, and it was my cue to bid adieu. I never wanted diamond rings, money or any material from you. All I ever wanted was your time, love and affection. I can't express the joy I would feel whenever I saw you in person or whenever my phone rang with your name flashing on the screen. I knew you were the one from the first time I met you, and its okay you didnt feel that way but I wish you didn't string me along.

1jn8ks8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1jn8ks8/from_hempseed_gruel_to_cbd_the_curious_history_of/,From hempseed gruel to CBD: the curious history of cannabis as a health product,"# Today‚Äôs regulatory gaps and health concerns about CBD reflect those of the 19th century, when cannabis was first commercialised by the food industry.

Listen to this article6 min

The cannabis-derived product CBD has been hailed¬†[‚Äúthe wonder drug of our age‚Äù](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/05/cbd-a-marijuana-miracle-or-another-health-fad-cannabidiol-anxiety-epilepsy), offering potential health benefits without the high. From juices and coffee to truffles and ice cream, CBD products have flooded the market for consumers looking for an answer to health problems from anxiety to insomnia.

But with CBD products in the UK and EU falling under¬†[‚Äúnovel foods‚Äù](https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance/regulated-products/novel-foods-guidance)¬†regulations rather than pharmaceutical standards, they aren‚Äôt subjected to the same rigorous safety and quality controls as drugs. The UK‚Äôs Committee on Toxicology has even flagged potential health risks,¬†[such as liver injury](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273230023001502), leading the Food Standards Agency to issue¬†[safety guidance](https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/cannabidiol-cbd).

The regulatory gaps and health concerns of today reflect those of the 19th century when cannabis products were commercialised by the food industry.

In the 1830s,¬†[William Brooke O‚ÄôShaughnessy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385975/), an Irish doctor, discovered that cannabis was effective in treating muscle spasms and stomach cramps. French psychiatrist¬†[Jacques-Joseph Moreau](https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.3.458)¬†later explored its potential for mental illness. This led many 19th-century doctors to champion cannabis as a cure-all.

It wasn‚Äôt long before patent medicine manufacturers began using cannabis as a common ingredient in their formulas. But soon, cannabis wasn‚Äôt just in pharmacies ‚Äì it was in food.

Surprisingly, this shift was not driven by the food industry, but by the free church environment in Sweden as part of efforts to combat tuberculosis ‚Äì a leading cause of death across all social classes¬†[in the country at the time](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(15)00024-7/fulltext).

*An employee drops Greek CBD oil produced of medical cannabis during ‚ÄòCannabisexpo 2020‚Äô exhibition of medical cannabis in Athens, Greece, 12 January 2020. Greece was among the first countries to allow medical cannabis cultivation in Europe in 2017. EPA-EFE/KOSTAS TSIRONIS*

Paul Petter Waldenstr√∂m, leader of the Swedish Mission Covenant, wrote a letter to Svenska Morgonbladet about a woman reportedly cured of tuberculosis by a homebrewed gruel made with hempseed, rye flour and milk. His endorsement helped popularise the remedy and many started making their own¬†[‚ÄúWaldenstr√∂m gruel‚Äù](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhrm-01-2024-0002/full/html), as it became known.

Sensing a business opportunity, entrepreneur J. Barthelson developed a powdered commercial version with the elegant French name Extrait Cannabis. He marketed it as a dietary remedy for tuberculosis, chest diseases and low energy. As demand grew, competitors quickly jumped on the bandwagon, using fearmongering tactics to persuade consumers that they were putting their lives at risk without it.

# The rise and fall of Maltos-Cannabis

The most striking cannabis-infused product of the era came from the Red Cross Technical Factory. Their ‚Äúhealth drink‚Äù, Maltos-Cannabis, was a maltose and cannabis blend marketed as both nutritious and delicious, especially when mixed with cocoa.

With an aggressive advertising campaign, the company raked in nearly¬†[SEK 290,000](https://runeberg.org/rhasvindus/2/0201.html)¬†a year (around ¬£775,000 in modern money), opening factories in Chicago, Helsinki, Brussels and Utrecht.

A particularly dramatic advertisement depicted the Grim Reaper fleeing from the light of science, shining from a lighthouse. Meanwhile, a mother and daughter raised their arms triumphantly, symbolising victory over death thanks to Maltos-Cannabis. The tagline boldly claimed that the product had ‚Äúa big future‚Äù.

Maltos-Cannabis advertisement, H√§lsov√§nnen, 1 February 1894. Image: Wikimedia Commons

However, questions swirled about its legitimacy. Newspapers debated whether the product was a groundbreaking remedy or¬†[‚Äúa pure scam product‚Äù](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jhrm-01-2024-0002/full/html). While some critics called the craze an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù, others argued coffee was more harmful ‚Äì a hot topic in Sweden‚Äôs parliament at the time.

In response, Red Cross published a half-page rebuttal signed by its executives, defending the product‚Äôs credibility. But scepticism persisted. After various lawsuits and growing concerns over its effectiveness and safety, sales of Maltos-Cannabis began to decline. By the 1930s, the product had disappeared entirely.

# Does history repeat itself?

The 19th-century commercial cannabis market was able to thrive due to the absence of marketing regulations for both food and pharmaceutical products. Manufacturers freely advertised their products using pseudo-scientific claims and buzzword-heavy marketing ‚Äì strategies we‚Äôre seeing again today in the thriving CBD industry.



This is because CBD is a¬†[‚Äúborderline‚Äù](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/borderline-products-how-to-tell-if-your-product-is-a-medicine)¬†product, existing in a regulatory grey area that allows for marketing strategies to flourish without stringent oversight. Much like in the past, brands tap into consumers‚Äô health anxieties with promises of a wellness revolution. Most worryingly, social media influencers are being¬†[used](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13011-023-00546-x)¬†to endorse CBD, making it particularly appealing for younger audiences.

With the global CBD market valued at¬†[US$19 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cannabidiol-consumer-health-market)¬†in 2023 and projected to grow by 16% annually until 2030, looking back at the broader, problematic history of commercial cannabis should serve as a cautionary tale.¬†**DM**¬†

I bought this steamer trunk yesterday and have been watching YouTube videos and Googling how to restore it and make it usable as a coffee table.

The problem I encountered is that the tools used in tutorials are more advanced, or the steamer trunks seem to be made of different materials, on the outside.

What would you recommend I do with average tools at home, or what are some cheap tools worth buying?

Specifically, how can I make the top part look more presentable? I assume some of the stains are glue residue, but they didn‚Äôt come off with normal scrubbing. Also, is there a way to reduce or remove scratches without repainting everything? Is that even possible?

13g Vanilla Extract or Paste

10g Salt

I added walnuts and chocolate chips as inclusions during the 2nd and 3rd stretch and folds, didn‚Äôt measure. 

Recipe: 
Add 50g cocoa powder and 100g coffee or water to a bowl, mix and let sit for 2-3 minutes. Then add all the following ingredients; 150g active starter, 300-350g filtered water, 50g brown sugar, and 13g vanilla extract or paste. Mix until sugar is dissolved and then add 500 g bread flour and 10g of salt. Mix until shaggy dough and cover for an hour. Perform first set of stretch and folds, 4 times around the bowl. Cover and let sit another hour. For second stretch and folds, repeat. I added the chocolate chips (optional). For third set, repeat. This is where I added in the walnuts. Cover and let bulk ferment on counter until doubled in size (I did around another 3 hours, so 6 total). Shape and cover with towel for 15-20 minutes. Shape again and add to banneton. Cover and let sit for 30 or begin cold proofing. I skipped the cold proofing so I am following what I did. After 30 minutes, I preheated oven to 450 for 1 hour and while it was preheating, I added the dough to the freezer. Took out the dough with 30 minutes remaining on the timer and let sit on counter until the hour went up. Put dough in dutch oven with lid for 20 minutes and scored at 8 minutes of cooking. Took lid off and lowered heat to 400, letting it cook an extra 30 minutes.

I didn‚Äôt cut into it yet, going to wait until the morning to do so but I am excited to see how it turns out and wanted to share incase anyone wants to try it for themselves!

1jn7wrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jn7wrp/aitah_for_making_my_husband_leave_his_hotel_and/,AITAH for making my husband leave his hotel and sleep at home instead?,"Background: I'm (40F) currently 34 weeks pregnant with my 2nd child and it's not been an easy pregnancy. Extreme morning sickness for 6 months, potential pre-eclampsia, recently gestation diabetes, and an unexplained episode of light bleeding. It's basically taken me out to the point where my husband (40M) has had to take over parenting duties for our 5 year old in the evenings, specifically bathtime and bedtime.

My husband works full time and I'm a SAHM. Normally, I'm the primary caregiver in the mornings and afternoons before and after school and in the evenings doing bathtime and bedtime nightly, with my husband doing bathtime a couple nights a week. About 2 months into the pregnancy I was so severely sick I basically had to lie down in the early evenings, so husband took bathtime over and I'd still do bedtime. About 3 weeks ago I had a spotting episode and was put on rest, so husband started taking over bedtime about a week ago.

Fast forward to last night: husband has a weekly Zoom call with friends on the weekends after the kiddo is in bed, around 8:30pm. It's a guys chat, so I expect the conversation to be a little rowdy and keep to a distance (usually upstairs in another room), especially since it's normally alcohol-fueled. This particular time, however, I overheard some of the things my husband was saying and they were particularly degrading. He was referring to his boss and things he'd like to do to her, talking about her looks and sharing pictures of her with the group. To say what he was saying, within earshot especially, I found totally disgusting and told him as much. I've mentioned to him in the recent past my dislike of situations like this which have occurred several times, and overhearing him saying gross things (let alone him thinking them), so to continue to do it also made me particularly upset. I was so upset I had to get out of the house to clear my head and made a quick coffee run, then came back and sat in the car in the driveway for about a half hour. Before I left I let him know I needed to go on a quick drive because I was so disgusted by his comments and behavior and needed a moment of space.

When I came back I went straight up to bed, not knowing if he'd still be on his phone call and also not wanting to get into a discussion if that was the case. Within about 30 minutes, I saw a message that he'd left to sleep at a hotel for a few days, with no real explanation why (aside from him being angry about me being angry). 

After a couple text messages and several ignored calls, he finally picked up and I asked him why he thought it was ok to leave with no explanation, no location, and basically ghost me, at 11:30 at night. I told him I thought that was a crazy response to me being deservedly upset and that I was coming to pick him up (he had Ubered to a hotel a few miles away, given that he was inebriated). I carried our 5 year old to the car and then drove over. Husband is now upset I came to the hotel, though he did come home of his own free will.

1jn7uku,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jn7uku/i_tried_lulutox_tea_for_6_weeks_heres_what/,"I Tried Lulutox Tea for 6 Weeks ‚Äî Here‚Äôs What Actually Happened (Weight, Energy, Bloating + Side Effects)","Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my **real experience using Lulutox Detox Tea** because I couldn‚Äôt find a lot of authentic, detailed reviews when I was looking it up myself. I‚Äôve seen it getting traction on TikTok, and the ingredients looked solid, so I figured‚Ä¶ why not test it for 6 weeks?

This is **not a paid review**, and I‚Äôm not one to hype stuff up without reason. If you‚Äôre curious about **lulutox tea side effects**, results, how it tastes, and whether **Lulutox Detox Tea actually works**, I‚Äôve got you covered here.

**Why I Tried Lulutox Tea (And What I Was Hoping For)**

So, for some context, I‚Äôm a 34-year-old woman working a full-time desk job, with a tendency to bloat like crazy, especially after lunch. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù but definitely had about 10-15 lbs of stubborn weight around my stomach and hips that just *refused* to go, no matter how ‚Äúclean‚Äù I ate.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting miracles, but if **lulutox detox tea** could help reduce bloating, give me a bit more energy, and maybe support a small weight drop‚ÄîI‚Äôd be thrilled.

**The Ingredients Looked Legit (And Natural)**

One thing that stood out right away was the **lulutox tea ingredients** list. I recognized a bunch of the superfoods like:

* **Matcha Green Tea**
* **Yerba Mate**
* **Oolong Tea**
* **Dandelion Leaf**
* **Milk Thistle**
* **Ginseng**
* **Goji Berries**

It‚Äôs a mix I‚Äôve seen recommended individually for things like **detox, energy, digestion**, and **fat burning**, but rarely combined in one tea. I liked that it‚Äôs **vegan, non-GMO, soy-free**, and not loaded with sugar or weird additives.

**What Drinking It Was Actually Like**

Taste-wise? Surprisingly good. It‚Äôs got a **light peach flavor** with a mild earthiness, not bitter at all. I drank it once a day, usually around 10 a.m. Sometimes I had it iced, and sometimes hot‚Äîit worked either way.

Also, the **tea bags are pyramid-shaped**, which I think helps the leaves steep more fully. Bonus points for them being biodegradable.

**What I Noticed (Week-by-Week Recap)**

**Week 1‚Äì2:**  
I didn‚Äôt expect anything, but by day 4, **my bloating was down noticeably**. Normally, my pants feel tight by the end of the day, but I was comfortably zipping up jeans I hadn‚Äôt worn in months.

**Week 3‚Äì4:**  
Energy-wise, this is when it kicked in. I normally rely on two cups of coffee, but I cut down to one without feeling sluggish. I wasn‚Äôt jittery or crashing in the afternoon either. Also, my digestion felt way more ‚Äúregular‚Äù (if you know what I mean üôà).

**Week 5‚Äì6:**  
I weighed myself and had dropped just under 6 lbs‚Äînot dramatic, but *real*. My stomach looked flatter, and a friend even asked what I was doing differently. Mentally, I just felt clearer and more motivated to eat well and move my body.

**Any Lulutox Tea Side Effects?**

I was worried about cramping or running to the bathroom all day like other detox teas, but I didn‚Äôt experience that. It‚Äôs *very gentle* on the stomach. That said, everyone‚Äôs different. I did notice I had to drink more water, which is probably a good thing anyway.

**Is Lulutox Detox Tea Safe?**

From everything I‚Äôve read and experienced, it seems pretty safe if used as directed. It‚Äôs not a laxative-heavy formula like other detox teas. Still, always smart to check with a doctor if you‚Äôre on meds or have medical conditions.

**Where to Buy Lulutox Tea (Be Careful of Knockoffs)**

If you're wondering **lulutox tea where to buy**, it‚Äôs only sold on their [**official site here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) ‚Äî and yeah, there are a lot of fake listings on Amazon and random shops, so I wouldn‚Äôt risk it.

They were running a 70% off deal when I bought it, and I think it‚Äôs still live. Here‚Äôs the [**second link I saved when I ordered**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) if that one works better.

**Final Thoughts: Does Lulutox Detox Tea Work?**

Honestly‚Ä¶ it did for me.

Is **lulutox detox tea a miracle drink?** No. But combined with light exercise and decent eating, it *definitely* helped with **bloating**, gave me a **steady energy boost**, and made it easier to stay consistent. Plus, the taste makes it easy to stick with.

Would I recommend it? If you‚Äôre looking for a gentle, natural way to support weight loss and feel better day-to-day, **Lulutox Tea** is worth a shot. Just keep your expectations realistic and give it at least a few weeks to notice changes.
