1otzjq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LAMetro/comments/1otzjq4/pismo_beach_to_la_traffic/,Pismo Beach to LA traffic,"Hello!
Hypothetical (or not so much in my world) question to my LA peeps. This is going to require some brain work with the math and I need help. A friend from out of town is visiting this weekend, and we decided to take a trip up the central coast to Pismo Beach.  In short, how realistic is it to leave Pismo by 10AM, hit Avila Farms to buy Pies, Do a quick sweep of the monarch preserve in Pismo, then hit Porto’s in Northridge, charge my RV for 10-15 minutes, and make it to LAX by 4PM with a person who moves slowly? And needs a few coffee and potty breaks?

If you want to long version:


My friend has a flight out of LAX at 6PM on Monday of Veterans Day weekend. I have warned her traffic in LA is unpredictable and volatile, and it’s possible we may hit traffic in Santa Barbara as well or on the 101. Keep in mind, my friend is not a fast mover - slow to get up and get ready, lingers in stores, and when going out  to eat, and needs multiple bathroom breaks and coffee stops. 

We have planned to go to breakfast at 9, and leave our hotel in Pismo by 10AM. From there, we will go to Avila Farms, only to buy pies for Thanksgiving, then to the Butterfly Sanctuary in Pismo off the 101 to briefly see the wintering Monarchs. From there, we plan to head towards LAX….after going to Porto’s in Northridge. 

My friend is dead set on going to Porto’s in Northridge, which really isn’t on our route off the 101, or convenient. If our ETA to Porto’s in Northridge is 2PM, and she needs to be at the airport 2 hrs in advance by 4PM to pass TSA and board the flight, how realistic is this? Please keep mind, it’s certain we will need at least one bathroom break along the way. Also keep in mind, if we stop at Porto’s, I need to stop and charge my electric vehicle for at least 10-15 minutes to make it to LAX safely. Also, Porto’s lines are insane and unpredictable, like LA traffic. We will need to head down the 405 to LAX after Porto’s. Do you think this is realistic, or should we skip? 

PS - I know this is a multifaceted equation, and my brain simply cannot do the math. Thank you my friends! 💙

1otzhtu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1otzhtu,Welcome to Camp Mojave ⛺️🌵🏜️,"Just finished building this desert campground! 

I imagine Camp Mojave being a summer field trip location in a desert region somewhere like Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, or California. It’s one of those campgrounds that a well-funded middle school, high school, or community center would take students annually for a short getaway to experience and learn more about nature, breathtaking desert landscapes, animal and plant life, and the indigenous peoples of the region. 

I wanted it to feel fun, rustic, homey, somewhat quaint, encompassed with nature and greenery, and full of activities and adventure. I imagine the teens and chaperones participating in activities such as hiking, birding, stargazing, buggy riding, dune boarding, swimming, sports, games, and all of your typical camping pastimes. 

The main building features:

• A Welcome and Information Center - Visitors can grab coffee and tea, purchase keepsakes, and even check out a display of desert beetles
• Dining Hall - Campers can choose to enjoy their meals here or in the outdoor dining space. They can also stop by the bulletin board in the dining room to see what’s on the agenda during their stay
• Indoor/Outdoor Kitchen - Includes plenty of space for Camp Mojave staff to prep meals, plus an outdoor kitchen for BBQ and wood-fired pizzas 
• Recreation Room - Hosts an array of games and activities for the teens to enjoy in their downtime 
• Screening Room - Perfectly equipped for informative presentations and cozy movie nights. Popcorn and candy free of charge!
• Observation Deck - Sims can birdwatch, stargaze, or relax by the fireplace 

Additionally, this lot includes: 

• Designated living quarters for the Owner(s)/Head Counselor(s)
• Two cabins sleeping 12 Sims each
• An outdoor dining area 
• A swing tree
• A campfire perfect for s’mores and spooky stories
• A small performance area for camp talent shows and guitar solos courtesy of the Head Counselor
• A furnished tent for campers to chill out in and have picnics during the day 
• An outdoor bathroom area including outhouses, a trough sink, and private showers 
• A basketball court and rockclimbing wall 
• A gated pool area with a slide, hot tub, volleyball net, floaties, and plenty of lounge chairs 

So glad I could finally use some of the camping items we got seeing the summer updates! This was a fun build to create ✨

1otzeob,https://www.reddit.com/r/valvereplacement/comments/1otzeob/here_we_go_again/,Here we go again…,"So, last week I met with my surgeon to discuss my ongoing case. This post is a little long, and is not meant as a cautionary tale to anyone considering valve replacement surgery, it is a life saving surgery, but my experience over the past year has been interesting and frustrating to say the least.

One year ago last Saturday I had an OHS to replace my aortic valve. The surgery went well, and I was doing well with pain management, walking and my insperometer. While in the hospital I developed an ileus, so what was supposed to be a 4-5 day stay in the hospital turned into an 11 day ordeal. After the ileus was resolved with the help of coffee mixed with prune juice, I got sent home to rest and mend. A couple days after getting home, I developed a horrible case of hives, which required two trips to the ER and a couple shots of epinephrine. It turned out that I suddenly became allergic to the Diltiazem and Protonix that I had been taking the whole time I was in the hospital. Once I stopped taking those two meds it all went away.

A few months later I have a follow up echo and they discover that for some reason my mitral valve now has moderate to severe regurgitation. A follow up echo downgraded it to mild to moderate, but still regurgitating. Also, a chest x ray was done and they told me that my sternum has not fused back together and they want to do a sternal plating procedure to make me solid again. This was scheduled to happen in July. 
At this point I’m beginning to think something doesn’t sound right. 

Then, on July 5th I blacked out while watching the Ozzy tribute and wound up in the ER again. Now I’m thinking something isn’t right. Another echo a few days later showed my mitral valve now has severe regurgitation and I am seriously beginning to feel it. The sternal plating is canceled because they don’t want to seal me up in case someone has to go in again. 

A TEE was performed in August and confirms that my mitral regurgitation is severe and showed that I have a “tethered” leaflet and a cleft in the annulus. I’m now told I need to have my mitral valve replaced too. The hospital and doctors that did my AVR do not do MVR so I have to be referred to another hospital with a new doctor. 

So, I finally met with the chief of cardiac surgery up in Portland to discuss my fate.

After asking me how I’m feeling and me telling him that life kinda sucks right now, he tells me that after reviewing my case, and all the films, I definitely need to have my mitral valve replaced. However, he said that in order for him to get to the mitral valve, he has to remove the year old aortic valve and replace it with a new one after he does the mitral. So, I will have a new bio-prosthetic mitral valve and a new Inspiris Resilia aortic valve when this is all done. Recovery will be 8-10 weeks. 

Thanks for reading my story. It feels good to get it all down in words. I’m still processing it and trying to keep a positive attitude. 

My second surgery is scheduled for Wednesday, December 3rd. One year, one month and two days after my first.",3,1762833106.0,valvereplacement,0,1.0,False

1otzebo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1otzebo/friendship_troubles/,Friendship troubles,"Looking for some advice on how to approach this conversation with my best friend. We have been extremely close for the past 10 years. 5 years ago I had a child which did change our dynamic a bit. She is single and likes going out which obviously I can't do as much anymore. 
The last 3 months or so she has started texting me less and less, leaving me on read for hours, does not invite me to do anything with her. We meet up once a week for coffee and everything is fine in person when we talk, but in between it feels like she is has no time or interest in messaging me (we used to talk over text all day every day). She's always telling me about things she does with other people and now every story she tells me starts with ""did I tell you this already?"" Or "" I think I told you this"" and it's stuff she hasn't told me but has obviously talked about with other people. So it feels horrible, like she has time to do stuff and talk with other people but not me.

 I just want to know the best way to tell her these things without making her defensive 
I'm scared the friendship is slowly dying. I am not totally innocent here either, I have taken a long time to reply sometimes or not been 100 percent there (because of working full time with a kid) and I too stopped asking her to do things (because she bailed 3 times in a row, or just didn't seem interested) she has a lot of other close friends, and I only have 1-2 other close friends, so I get anxious that she will be fine without this friendship because she has others to fall back on 
Any advice on how to handle this conversation? We are both people pleasers so this doesn't come naturally for either of us!",0,1762833074.0,AskWomenOver30,1,0.5,False
1otzdl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumpsandBeyondAu/comments/1otzdl8/baby_reflex_and_postpartum_pain_and_cramps/,Baby reflex and postpartum pain and cramps,"Thought I share something with the sub because it was a big learning curve for me.

Bub had serious reflex issues from week 2 when formula fed. She would have a bottle, fall asleep, and then 10 mins later she would reflex and vomit everything out, and start screaming. This repeated all day and night for 3 weeks. We tried different brands of formula, nothing worked.

Then we came across Aptamil reflux formula, it stoppef the reflux but it gave her constipation. And it was so thick she had trouble sucking the formula from the bottle. So we ended up mixing Aptamil regular with reflux, and adjusted to the point that she has no reflux nor constipation. For us it was 1.6 scoop of Aptamil and 0.6 scoop of reflux with 120ml of water 

Also I had mysterious cramps that hurt really really bad postpartum. But nothing explains to me what triggered the cramps. I went to GP and did bloods and ultrasound and everything was fine. 

I have had the cramps every 3-4 days postpartum for 3 months. Then I read that for some people having hot drinks postpartum triggers cramps. I immediately realised every time I had the cramps was after I had morning or afternoon coffee. Also I found out stretching in bed actually alleviates the cramps.

I have been super careful with food and drink temperature and so far it seems a lot better. Will keep monitoring. Thought I share with the sub in case someone is going through something similar. ",1,1762833013.0,BabyBumpsandBeyondAu,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

The ground was cold, I felt tired, but my heart was racing a hundred miles a minute. I slowly pried my body off the frost grass and looked up toward the twisted branches of the trees. My mind is quiet, almost mimicking the forest or woods, I don’t know. Despite the cold breeze, I don’t feel anything. Put my hand to my chest to check if I am alive —and yes, I am alive. I look to my left and see a trail about a mile away. I don’t know where I’m headed, but I can’t stay here forever. I slowly start walking toward the trail without an ounce of urgency in my step. “Should I be running?” “What will I be running from?”   The thought of that alone scared me. The crunching under my foot encourages my mind to wander, “Why am I still moving?” My body starts to shiver, but not from the cold. I stop to close my eyes. Flashes of images plague my eyelids. A man yelling, white walls, water—lots of water. I quickly open my eyes to run away from the pictures. Nothing makes sense. I don’t know who I am. Why am I here? Who am I running from?  As I see the trail getting closer, my feet pick up the pace. It's so close, I’m so close. I hear yelling in the distance, “MNEME!!!”, “NEM NEM !!!”  There seem to be a couple of people, I don’t recognize what they are calling for, but I feel the need to run towards them. I want to see them. It seemed like suddenly my body started running on its own. As I reach the trail, I look down the road and don’t see anything. “THERE SHE IS!!!” whip my head to me, four people racing toward me, two men and two women. My body stops shivering, and my mind grows silent with one last hopeful thought: “Are they looking for me?”

Chapter 2

I grab onto the bus railing and quickly pull away as I feel its sticky, wet exterior. I begrudgedly wipe my hand with a napkin between my other hand and coffee. I balled the napkin up into my contaminated hand and opted to sit down. I put in my earbuds and settle in for my ride. I looked out the window as Desert Disco by Beach Weather serenaded my ears. I slowly close my eyes, preparing for the hectic day I am about to enter. As the bus jolts, I suddenly open my eyes and see an elderly man and what looks to be his granddaughter board. A gorgeous brunette girl with bright green eyes, probably no older than 21, leads him closer to where I am sitting. “Is it okay if we sit here?” pointing at the seat holding my bag, “-OH, of course,” I said, flustered. I quickly moved my bag and let them settle in. I put the earbuds back in and hugged my backpack. As I fiddled with my apple charm, I looked over and saw the girl giggle as the old man whispered in her ear. I brush my braid behind my ear as if to help me listen in. I notice the woman tightly wrapped around his arm as if he were going to disappear. I try to contain my drama-filled thought: “They could just be really close.”  But my focus wanders to my peripherals as I see her whisper back and lick her lips. “Okay, that's not normal.” I quickly scan the bus to see if anyone is looking at me. I just had to confirm my suspicions, so I slowly closed my eyes and lightly touched the girl’s arm with my elbow. Allowing a flood of memories into my mind, I see her in a run-down apartment, counting money with a young man, also around 21. She gives him a peck on the lips as they laugh at the stupid amount of cash. Then my mind flashes to another scene: the girl, charismatically laughing over steak, with the old man telling her unremarkable stories of the olden days. She seductively rubs his leg under the table, showing off her red bottom heels. I slowly open my eyes to another jolt from the bus; I quickly apologize to the girl and get off at M-3. I watch as the bus drives off before walking down the rundown street, slightly dizzied from my snooping earlier. I should’ve minded my business. My mind keeps reminding me of how dangerous my abilities are. Every time I gain someone else's memories, I lose my own. It starts with my short-term memories, then eats away at my long-term ones. As a precaution, I try to fill my head with unimportant stories from the newspaper or social media posts, sometimes going over them twice to make sure they stay, also between clients. So, I would say I have some memories to spare. I approached a cube-like building with a red brick front and white sides; the roof was fenced off with a rooftop garden. Connected Thoughts Therapy Clinic. The inside is way better than its uninviting outside. I walked through the gated door to see Kyson spinning in his chair. As I heard the door shut, he shot up in his chair, straightening his posture. “Dr. Callen, back with the box braid, nice to see you back in your natural form.” That comment made me chuckle a little bit. “Did you steal that from your last Anime marathon?” “chiiilll, I’m just trying to lift team spirits.” He surely is trying, I guess. “Well, I’m not the person to direct to if you’re trying to get a raise.” “Yeah, but Dr. Vo is in a mood, and I need someone to practice on, you feel me.”  I dare not respond to his comments to not enhance his pretty-boy ego, but his ridiculous logic made me laugh all the way to my office. I glance at my door name plate, “Dr. Mneme Callen, Trauma Therapist”

I open the wooden door to a stack of papers, turning my neat desk into chaos. I hurriedly set my bag down beside the mess and scanned through the papers. “What the hell?” I whisper under my breath. I can feel my brow furrow as I stress. “KYSON!!!” I yelled. I looked at the door to see Kyson casually coming in. “What is all this?” I exclaimed. “Those are all the Trauma patients from the bus explosion a couple of weeks ago.”  He said this as if it were common knowledge. “What bus explosion?”  “The one that happened a couple of weeks ago on Chene St., it was all over the news. Dr. Vo even warned you about the possible influx of clients sent from nearby hospitals.”  I try to rack my brain for even a fragment of this event. “Damn, now I see what Dr. Vo means when he says your memory is horrible.” I flashed him with an unamused smile and sank into my chair. This must be one of the memories erased from my session last week. I know peering into my clients' memories has to be violating some kind of privacy laws —well, if they knew someone could access others' memories —but still. It helps me connect with them, and seeing them feel understood makes it worth it. I slowly sift through the paper, trying to plan how to manage all of them without leaving work with early-onset dementia. I sigh and mindlessly walk toward the door. I peer through the crack toward the reception desk. Kyson leaned back in his chair, his dread pushed back with a black plastic hairband, his blue polo slightly crinkling against the chair. Casually scrolling on his phone. I can see why all my female clients fall for him. His laid-back demeanor also gives off charisma in its own way. Almost like a breath of stress-free air after the horrors they have been through. I sigh again and head back to my chair. “ I will just need to keep that newspaper subscription,” I say to myself.  I bury my thoughts into organizing the swarm of client charts on my desk, organizing those who need an immediate meeting from those still waiting to be discharged. I open my desk drawer for a pen and see my newspaper from two weeks ago, “CITY BUS SET ABLAZE ON BUSY STREET.” I read through the dramatized article as if the situation wasn’t scary enough. A girl was not accounted for after the blast. People are speculating that she could be the cause or just scattered around the site. The options for what happened to this poor girl are both horrifying. A knock at the door woke me up from my inner thoughts. Kyson's head peered through the door, eager to get back to his seat. “Your first client is here”, I quickly move all the papers to my desk drawer, trying to make it look as neat as possible. “Send them in, “I reply. A white man in his late 30s enters, his beard unkempt and his eyes bewildered. “Mr. Klein, it's nice to see you back.”  “Alex… Alex is fine.” “I’m sorry, Alex, please sit down. I gesture to the couch in the middle of the room and move to join him on the other couch across. “What brings you in today? Usually, I see you at the end of the week,” I said gently. “I saw.” What did you see, Alex?” “I saw the bus.” My brow furrows as I feel what his answer might be. “What did you see on the bus?” “No... no outside bus”, “the bus made a loud sound, then fire everywhere.” “My clothes...” he sobbed, “my clothes were ruined, too much blood.” I looked at myself fearfully. “I don’t want to clean blood,” he buried his head in his hands. My heart ached from his pain. Alex had lost all his money to his ex-wife, who was his high school sweetheart, and had cheated on him with her swim instructor. Turns out her swim instructor, then boyfriend, was really into drugs and got her hooked. One year after they divorced, Alex came home to see that his ex-wife and boyfriend had broken into his house and attempted to rob him, but ended up overdosing on meth. He did everything he could to save her, but it was too late. Now, he witnessed even more deaths. “Alex,” I say warmly, “Would you like to hold my hand?” He slowly lifted his head and nodded. As I grasped his hand, I could feel his sobs shake his whole body. “Let's do some square breathing before we talk, okay?” he vigorously shook his head yes. “Okay, follow me,” he said as he attempted to straighten up. I closed my eyes and started with four counts in. Then I sucked into Alex’s memories, and I saw him down Chene St. It looked like he was going to the barber shop to cheer himself up a bit. He made so much progress. I hear commotion and turn around in sync with him. A bus was driving erratically. I could feel the panic in Alex’s chest. Then…BOOM. The bus was in flames. Alex lunged forward into chaos and stopped in front of a little girl. I looked toward her legs, and everything was blurred. It seems that Alex had blocked this scene in his memory. I flashed to another scene where Alex uses his plaid shirt to stop another woman’s bleeding arm; she looked like she was about mid-50s with her tight, coiled hair spread out on the concrete. The woman is screaming and begging for someone to find her baby. A white fluffy dog with a hair bow. I whip around the scene to look for the dog, and I focus on an alleyway, although it is out of the memory frame, I see a figure peering from the building. I try to look further, but a wave of nausea hits. I suck myself back into reality and open my eyes. Alex is freaked out but slightly calmer. “Alright, now we can start our conversation.”

I've heard that Decent is complicated to use, and there is a very long ramp-up time to making a good espresso. However, with all the profiles/receipes that come with it, I would have thought it would be the opposite - that you can get good espresso and get used to the machine and making espresso in general by using the current profiles. It's only really when you want to start experimenting and really play with it that there's a lot of factors that you need to better understand.

For people who have a Decent machine, what is your experience? Is this something you would recommend for a newbie, or would you say that really you need to have a very good understanding of the fundamentals before even considering getting one? ",2,1762832652.0,decentespresso,3,1.0,False

Would you pray for
 a moment of happiness if
 you knew it would
 bring about the end of the world?


I don't really think that there is a good way to start my story, so I'm going to begin with the part that really caused this. I'm an adult in my twenties who, like many young adults, feels like my life doesn't have any purpose. Ever since I graduated high school, I have been roaming around North America, trying to find a place to call home-to find people to call home.
  My family is great, if a bit strange, but they weren't the type of family I wanted to have for my own. I wanted to find like-minded friends and maybe even someone to fall in love with, to make our own little family. I moved from state to state, hoping that the next place would have what I was looking for, but I was never so lucky.



Part one: I need a break


I had just moved into my new apartment in Cedar Hollow, Maine-a place so obscure I wasn’t even sure I’d heard of it before. But I needed somewhere to stay, and this cheap Craigslist find would have to do. It wasn’t the worst place I’d lived, but it was far from anything to brag about.

  Nearby, I landed a job at a small company called “Cryp-tee-d Co.”, which made quirky T-shirts featuring cryptids-those mysterious creatures from folklore. The shirts were amusing but hardly destined for big sales outside Maine. Little did I know, this job would mark the start of the darkest chapter of my life.

  At first, everything seemed normal. The company had a handful of long-time employees, and there was a steady flow of people coming and going. Over the first year, I met someone special, and by the end of that year, we decided to start dating.

  We had fun going on little dates, trying out odd restaurants, and venting about the ridiculous shirts we made-shirts no one ever seemed to wear. We dreamed of escaping the job, especially since our boss was a verbally abusive nightmare, constantly yelling about how we failed to capture the ""essence"" of cryptids in our designs.

  Both severely underpaid, we decided to move in together to split rent. That’s when things started to unravel.

  Spending every moment together should have been a blessing, but my old habits of self-sabotage crept in. Growing up in a strange family, I struggled with genuine affection. I thought gifts were the way to show love, but I forgot to be emotionally present. My girlfriend often told me this, but instead of opening up, I shut down and isolated her.

  Over two years, things worsened until she packed up and left. I never knew where she went. Attempts to reach her failed-she likely blocked me. I sank into a pit of despair that bled into my work, and the quality of my shirts plummeted.

  My boss’s anger grew with every recycled or worse design I submitted. Depression took hold. My last friend from high school grew distant, caught up in his own life. I started calling out of work, using family emergencies as excuses to take time off, but I never visited them. I feared their judgment and rejection.

  I stayed home, draining my savings, playing video games on my oblivious neighbor’s open Wi-Fi. My apartment was cold and lonely, even with the heat on. I never slept in the bedroom anymore-I wanted my things to still smell like her. Instead, I crashed on the awful couch she hated but I had insisted on keeping. It was a cruel joke how right she’d been about its discomfort.

  Things got so bleak I began searching for an escape-whether through drugs or something darker. One night, before sleep, I prayed to any god that might listen. I just needed a break.


Part 2: Learning to dream

  I started spending more and more time online, searching for ways to help myself. I tried everything-from psychedelic drugs to one of those online therapy apps. Honestly, those apps almost did more harm than good. The people never seemed all that professional, and after a few sessions, I felt even worse. One night, after another disappointing therapy call, I lay in bed feeling like I’d nearly run out of options. That’s when a memory from my school days floated up: lucid dreaming. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you become aware in your dream and can control everything about it. You could be a knight in a castle, a hero fighting Godzilla, or even create your own Garden of Eden. I made a mental note to call out of work the next day and dedicate myself to learning about lucid dreaming. As I drifted off to sleep, the last thing I remember was the faint sound of sorrowful laughter, then darkness.

  I was never one to sleep long, so a few hours later I woke up and decided to get coffee to jumpstart my research. I never really believed coffee made me more productive, but with enough sugar, at least I’d be wired enough to keep searching for answers. On my way home, I called my boss to say I was feeling sick and would be bedridden all day. As fate would have it, I was standing at a red light when my boss pulled up right beside me. We made eye contact-me on the phone, him in his car. He rolled down his window and yelled through both the phone and the open window that I’d better see him in his office as soon as I got to work, or I’d be fired. Frustrated with my own stupidity, I spiked my half-finished coffee onto the sidewalk, rushed home, changed into my work clothes, and headed in.

  When I got to my boss’s office, I knocked on the door. No answer. I waited, knocked again, still nothing. Slowly, I pushed the door open. He was sitting with his back to me, staring out the window. My heart sank-this was exactly how movies showed someone right before they were found dead. Was I about to be framed? Would I go to jail for something I didn’t do? Was today the end of my free life?

  I skirted around the edge of the room, careful not to touch anything. I didn’t want to leave any evidence behind. When I finally saw his face, I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. He wasn’t dead. But he wasn’t right, either. He sat there, unblinking, tears rolling down his cheeks, a huge smile plastered on his face. A strange, ominous laugh leaked out of him. As soon as I moved into his peripheral vision, he snapped back to his usual angry self. He barked at me for not knocking, told me to sit down, and when I just stood there, stunned, he grew red in the face and demanded I sit immediately. I backed around his desk and sat, never taking my eyes off him, wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.

  The conversation went about as well as I’d expected. He told me I was on my final strike. My shirt designs were slipping in quality, I’d been calling out too often, and I’d lied to him that very morning. If I didn’t shape up, I’d be out of a job. The whole time he yelled, tears kept streaming down his face, as if he didn’t even notice. I thought to myself that this might be the most uncomfortable situation I’d ever experienced.

  After that strange encounter, I went back to work and actually managed to come up with a few decent shirt ideas. The weirdness of the morning seemed to spark my creativity. When the day was over, I hurried home, eager to put the whole ordeal behind me. I didn’t have to work the next day, so I could stay up as late as I wanted researching lucid dreaming. Everything I read said I needed to get into a meditative state before dreaming. That was going to be tough, but I was determined. I sat on my uncomfortable couch, put on relaxing music, closed my eyes, and tried to meditate. I had no idea what I was doing, and before long, I just fell asleep without any results.

  Over the next week, I scoured YouTube for meditation guides and found a ton of options. But I didn’t pay for ad-free content, so every time I started to relax, a loud ad would jolt me out of it. I realized I’d need to make more money if I wanted to meditate without interruptions. So, I started showing up to work more often, and my boss seemed to ease up on me.

  After that day in my boss’s office, nothing weird happened between us, and I didn’t notice anything strange with anyone else. Gradually, I forgot about it. By the end of the month, I’d upgraded my streaming services so I could meditate without ads. I kept practicing, and little by little, my sleep improved.

  A week into my new routine, my dreams started to return. At first, they were just scattered fragments-disjointed ideas and themes-but it was better than nothing. I couldn’t remember them clearly, but just knowing I’d dreamed at all felt like progress. My life began to take a turn for the better. It’s amazing what a full eight hours of sleep can do, even if the motivation is just to avoid getting fired.

  A month in, I noticed the first signs of being able to control my dreams. I could make things happen on purpose and remember them when I woke up. It felt like directing a movie, though I was a pretty bad director. I could fly around the world, but since I’d never left the United States, my world was basically just a giant globe. I jumped off the Empire State Building and landed unharmed, like in that scene from The Matrix. I knew that with more practice, I could become a true lucid dreamer.

  The first time I had a dream where I was fully in control was incredible. I created a world of endless meadows and wildflowers, the sun shining bright and warm. I wandered through fields, feeling the grass brush against my legs, smelling the flowers. I set up a picnic and ate my favorite foods, which tasted better than anything I’d had in years. It was as if someone had turned up the color saturation in my life. For the first time in a long time, I felt okay. After eating, I wandered further, until I reached the edge of a dense, mysterious forest. It was thick but somehow inviting. I heard a stream trickling just beyond the trees. I tried to will the forest away, to return to the meadows, but nothing changed. Just as I gathered the courage to step into the forest, my alarm went off, pulling me back to reality. I decided that if I ever found myself at the edge of that forest again, I wouldn’t hesitate-I’d step in and explore the unknown corners of my dream.



Part 3:Hopeless Romantic 

  Something about the edge of that forest must have really messed with my subconscious, because after that dream, I couldn’t control my dreamscapes the way I had before. It was as if the border of that imagined woodland had erected a barrier in my mind, keeping me from returning to that place of wonder and possibility. Frustrated, I decided it was time to take a break from chasing dreams and focus on real life for a while.

  I figured some fresh air might do me good, so I actually applied for vacation time-legitimately, for once-and got it approved. I packed a bag, got in my car, and drove west for a couple of hours until I reached a quaint little town nestled beside a sparkling lake. The place felt like a secret, a pocket of peace tucked away from the world, and I decided I’d spend at least one night there.

  Wandering the town’s winding streets, I stumbled upon a shop that stood out from its sleepy surroundings: “Conspira-See,” the sign read, adorned with a psychedelic eye. The place looked so out of place, I couldn’t resist stepping inside. Given my own line of work, I was curious to see if the people here were as odd as the ones back home.

  Inside, the store was a treasure trove of the bizarre and the old-books that looked a century past, shelves crowded with objects I couldn’t even begin to name. There were cryptid references everywhere, familiar and strange all at once. But the oddest thing by far was the complete absence of a shopkeeper. I waited at the counter, called out, and heard nothing but the creak of old wood. Suddenly, a shuffling noise behind me made my skin prickle. I spun around, heart pounding.

  Standing just two paces away was what I thought was a statue of Mothman, looming over five feet tall. But then it moved-a young woman, dressed in a full Mothman costume, grinning at me with the satisfaction of a prank well played. She slipped out of the costume, laughter bubbling up as she saw how thoroughly she’d startled me.

  She was strikingly beautiful, with dark hair cascading down her back and eyes that sparkled with mischief. Her skin glowed with a warm, sun-kissed hue, and her smile-crooked, goofy, utterly endearing-caught me completely off guard. She moved with a charming clumsiness, and her voice, soft and lilting with an Irish accent, made me feel instantly at ease. Her name was Helena, and in that moment, I felt a strange, immediate connection.

  We chatted for a while, and she managed to convince me to buy a couple of odd trinkets. When I asked for her number, she laughed-a laugh that sounded oddly familiar, joyful but somehow forced at first, before settling into something more genuine. I brushed it off as my imagination, chalking it up to not having heard real laughter in too long.

  I left town the next day with a lighter heart and Helena’s number saved in my phone. We started texting, and I was surprised by how easy it was to talk to her. She told me about her love for painting and comics, and her enthusiasm made me realize I needed a hobby of my own-something more than just video games and meditation. I wanted to be a part of the world again, if only to have more to share with her.

  When she asked what I did for fun, I awkwardly tried to explain lucid dreaming. To my relief, she already knew all about it-more than I did, actually, which made sense given her job in that shop of curiosities.

  One evening, she suggested we talk on the phone. The thought gave me butterflies, and I dialed her number right away. As the phone rang, something strange happened: a raspy, ancient voice seemed to answer, whispering the word, “Holi’andr.” The name made me smile involuntarily, filling me with a sudden, inexplicable joy so intense that a tear rolled down my cheek. Then, just as quickly, the sensation faded, and Helena answered, her voice grounding me in reality. Relief and disappointment mingled inside me-I was happy, but a little wistful that I couldn’t always feel that euphoric.

  We talked late into the night, until I drifted off to sleep with the phone still pressed to my ear. It was the first time I’d slept in my own bed since my ex had left, and it felt like a turning point-a step forward into something new.

  The next morning, I woke up energized. At work, my creativity soared-I designed shirts better than I ever had, good enough that my boss actually complimented me for the first time. It was so out of character that I texted Helena about it right away. She replied with a joke about spreading positivity, and I couldn’t help but smile.

  That afternoon, I went on a cleaning spree at home, clearing out old junk and making space for something better. I scheduled an appointment to finally get my own internet connection, and even went grocery shopping instead of ordering in. Sitting in my freshly cleaned house, I realized how much lighter everything felt-the oppressive shadow of my past was finally gone.

  That night, I played some games and then settled in for meditation. For the second time ever, I slipped into a dream where I had full control. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was Helena’s presence in my life that made the difference. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to dream again-both asleep and awake.


If you read this far, thank you so much. This is the first story that I'm ever working on so it's fairly rougher in the edges but I was going for a spin on cosmic horror: cosmic bliss. I felt like I haven't seen too much of it so I tried to write the story that I would like to read.

I had a recent traumatic experience with PayPal who permanently limited my account after 3 years and started asking me for documents unrelated to my work as a freelancer and then took 30k+ or froze them can't even refund, it said 180 days, it was so depressing causing me to take loans and more workload to survive from the sudden financial problem. 

I also promised my siblings to pay for their needs only to be humiliated that I couldn't it was so painfully stressful. But as a breadwinner, I can't cry forever about it. So, I looked for an alternative way to earn and be paid that's comfortable for my clients (they don't want to use Wise or other payment methods that shows their personal information- I'm a freelance artist working with virtual streamers they usually prefer to hide their identity). 

  
Now, I'm using BuyMeACoffee and have $300+ when I withdraw it asked me to wait for review, they said it can take up to 7 days. I'm just a nervous wreck from the trauma from PayPal and that what I earned would be, again, taken from me. I usually, as a people pleaser, do not take away my client's right on their purchase or cancel their orders so it brings me a lot of stress to have the financial loss and needing to take more work and basically destroying my health to survive from my financial loss.

  
Sorry for adding too much info, but I want my heart to be prepared for disappointment and pain. Has anyone experience the verification process and how did it go for you?

  
I want to hope and rely on the money on my account but also don't want to have my heart broken from stress as this greatly affected my mental health and almost did the unthinkable during the initial panic and grief from PayPal. I want to know other users experience with BMC's accout review, it also hurts that PayPal waited for my balance to get higher before freezing my account and I'm afraid if BMC would do the same...

Which of course they did. 

Obviously now that they're both past the more common college age, and they both have kids, I see why it'd be more challenging to get a college education. While they both received absolutely subpar educations at SOTDRT, I've seen a fair amount of people with dismal grades get into college(s!) and succeed. Obviously Jing has her ads reciting podcast she has to maintain and Jill does wtf she does, but they could attend college? If they really wanted to, they could. Even if they didn't end up getting a degree, they could still take classes they're interested in just to get a feel for it. They seem pretty entrenched in being near/aroudn/affiliated with colleges, soooo, why not try? 

I guess it's also just unpopular in their depravity to be a formally educated woman. I mean it is for men too, lol.

If they were more normal, I can see both of them studying psychology. But that would open the can of worms that is their upbringing and gawsh that's just too hard. 

What do you think they'd study if they hypothetically attended college, if anything?

  When I got to my boss’s office, I knocked on the door. No answer. I waited, knocked again, still nothing. Slowly, I pushed the door open. He was sitting with his back to me, staring out the window. My heart sank-this was exactly how movies showed someone right before they were found dead. Was I about to be framed? Would I go to jail for something I didn’t do? Was today the end of my free life?

  I skirted around the edge of the room, careful not to touch anything. I didn’t want to leave any evidence behind. When I finally saw his face, I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. He wasn’t dead. But he wasn’t right, either. He sat there, unblinking, tears rolling down his cheeks, a huge smile plastered on his face. A strange, ominous laugh leaked out of him. As soon as I moved into his peripheral vision, he snapped back to his usual angry self. He barked at me for not knocking, told me to sit down, and when I just stood there, stunned, he grew red in the face and demanded I sit immediately. I backed around his desk and sat, never taking my eyes off him, wondering if I’d imagined the whole thing.

  The conversation went about as well as I’d expected. He told me I was on my final strike. My shirt designs were slipping in quality, I’d been calling out too often, and I’d lied to him that very morning. If I didn’t shape up, I’d be out of a job. The whole time he yelled, tears kept streaming down his face, as if he didn’t even notice. I thought to myself that this might be the most uncomfortable situation I’d ever experienced.

  After that strange encounter, I went back to work and actually managed to come up with a few decent shirt ideas. The weirdness of the morning seemed to spark my creativity. When the day was over, I hurried home, eager to put the whole ordeal behind me. I didn’t have to work the next day, so I could stay up as late as I wanted researching lucid dreaming. Everything I read said I needed to get into a meditative state before dreaming. That was going to be tough, but I was determined. I sat on my uncomfortable couch, put on relaxing music, closed my eyes, and tried to meditate. I had no idea what I was doing, and before long, I just fell asleep without any results.

  Over the next week, I scoured YouTube for meditation guides and found a ton of options. But I didn’t pay for ad-free content, so every time I started to relax, a loud ad would jolt me out of it. I realized I’d need to make more money if I wanted to meditate without interruptions. So, I started showing up to work more often, and my boss seemed to ease up on me.

  After that day in my boss’s office, nothing weird happened between us, and I didn’t notice anything strange with anyone else. Gradually, I forgot about it. By the end of the month, I’d upgraded my streaming services so I could meditate without ads. I kept practicing, and little by little, my sleep improved.

  A week into my new routine, my dreams started to return. At first, they were just scattered fragments-disjointed ideas and themes-but it was better than nothing. I couldn’t remember them clearly, but just knowing I’d dreamed at all felt like progress. My life began to take a turn for the better. It’s amazing what a full eight hours of sleep can do, even if the motivation is just to avoid getting fired.

  A month in, I noticed the first signs of being able to control my dreams. I could make things happen on purpose and remember them when I woke up. It felt like directing a movie, though I was a pretty bad director. I could fly around the world, but since I’d never left the United States, my world was basically just a giant globe. I jumped off the Empire State Building and landed unharmed, like in that scene from The Matrix. I knew that with more practice, I could become a true lucid dreamer.

  The first time I had a dream where I was fully in control was incredible. I created a world of endless meadows and wildflowers, the sun shining bright and warm. I wandered through fields, feeling the grass brush against my legs, smelling the flowers. I set up a picnic and ate my favorite foods, which tasted better than anything I’d had in years. It was as if someone had turned up the color saturation in my life. For the first time in a long time, I felt okay. After eating, I wandered further, until I reached the edge of a dense, mysterious forest. It was thick but somehow inviting. I heard a stream trickling just beyond the trees. I tried to will the forest away, to return to the meadows, but nothing changed. Just as I gathered the courage to step into the forest, my alarm went off, pulling me back to reality. I decided that if I ever found myself at the edge of that forest again, I wouldn’t hesitate-I’d step in and explore the unknown corners of my dream.



Part 3:Hopeless Romantic 

  Something about the edge of that forest must have really messed with my subconscious, because after that dream, I couldn’t control my dreamscapes the way I had before. It was as if the border of that imagined woodland had erected a barrier in my mind, keeping me from returning to that place of wonder and possibility. Frustrated, I decided it was time to take a break from chasing dreams and focus on real life for a while.

  I figured some fresh air might do me good, so I actually applied for vacation time-legitimately, for once-and got it approved. I packed a bag, got in my car, and drove west for a couple of hours until I reached a quaint little town nestled beside a sparkling lake. The place felt like a secret, a pocket of peace tucked away from the world, and I decided I’d spend at least one night there.

  Wandering the town’s winding streets, I stumbled upon a shop that stood out from its sleepy surroundings: “Conspira-See,” the sign read, adorned with a psychedelic eye. The place looked so out of place, I couldn’t resist stepping inside. Given my own line of work, I was curious to see if the people here were as odd as the ones back home.

  Inside, the store was a treasure trove of the bizarre and the old-books that looked a century past, shelves crowded with objects I couldn’t even begin to name. There were cryptid references everywhere, familiar and strange all at once. But the oddest thing by far was the complete absence of a shopkeeper. I waited at the counter, called out, and heard nothing but the creak of old wood. Suddenly, a shuffling noise behind me made my skin prickle. I spun around, heart pounding.

  Standing just two paces away was what I thought was a statue of Mothman, looming over five feet tall. But then it moved-a young woman, dressed in a full Mothman costume, grinning at me with the satisfaction of a prank well played. She slipped out of the costume, laughter bubbling up as she saw how thoroughly she’d startled me.

  She was strikingly beautiful, with dark hair cascading down her back and eyes that sparkled with mischief. Her skin glowed with a warm, sun-kissed hue, and her smile-crooked, goofy, utterly endearing-caught me completely off guard. She moved with a charming clumsiness, and her voice, soft and lilting with an Irish accent, made me feel instantly at ease. Her name was Helena, and in that moment, I felt a strange, immediate connection.

  We chatted for a while, and she managed to convince me to buy a couple of odd trinkets. When I asked for her number, she laughed-a laugh that sounded oddly familiar, joyful but somehow forced at first, before settling into something more genuine. I brushed it off as my imagination, chalking it up to not having heard real laughter in too long.

  I left town the next day with a lighter heart and Helena’s number saved in my phone. We started texting, and I was surprised by how easy it was to talk to her. She told me about her love for painting and comics, and her enthusiasm made me realize I needed a hobby of my own-something more than just video games and meditation. I wanted to be a part of the world again, if only to have more to share with her.

  When she asked what I did for fun, I awkwardly tried to explain lucid dreaming. To my relief, she already knew all about it-more than I did, actually, which made sense given her job in that shop of curiosities.

  One evening, she suggested we talk on the phone. The thought gave me butterflies, and I dialed her number right away. As the phone rang, something strange happened: a raspy, ancient voice seemed to answer, whispering the word, “Holi’andr.” The name made me smile involuntarily, filling me with a sudden, inexplicable joy so intense that a tear rolled down my cheek. Then, just as quickly, the sensation faded, and Helena answered, her voice grounding me in reality. Relief and disappointment mingled inside me-I was happy, but a little wistful that I couldn’t always feel that euphoric.

  We talked late into the night, until I drifted off to sleep with the phone still pressed to my ear. It was the first time I’d slept in my own bed since my ex had left, and it felt like a turning point-a step forward into something new.

  The next morning, I woke up energized. At work, my creativity soared-I designed shirts better than I ever had, good enough that my boss actually complimented me for the first time. It was so out of character that I texted Helena about it right away. She replied with a joke about spreading positivity, and I couldn’t help but smile.

  That afternoon, I went on a cleaning spree at home, clearing out old junk and making space for something better. I scheduled an appointment to finally get my own internet connection, and even went grocery shopping instead of ordering in. Sitting in my freshly cleaned house, I realized how much lighter everything felt-the oppressive shadow of my past was finally gone.

  That night, I played some games and then settled in for meditation. For the second time ever, I slipped into a dream where I had full control. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was Helena’s presence in my life that made the difference. Maybe, just maybe, I was starting to dream again-both asleep and awake.


If you read this far, thank you so much. This is the first story that I'm ever working on so it's fairly rougher in the edges but I was going for a spin on cosmic horror: cosmic bliss. I felt like I haven't seen too much of it so I tried to write the story that I would like to read.

I have discovered that to break through all the flakes out there, it is best to meet for lunch or coffee right away. Not only does it weed out those who are not genuinely interested, but I personally feel that you get to know a person much better than you do over text.

This guy's profile mentioned being an animal lover, which was a positive for me, as I am too. We agreed to meet for lunch within a few days of the first text. I was really looking forward to this date because he mentioned that he had pigs, and I found that an interesting fact. I also appreciated that he was seeking a long-term relationship, just as I was. We exchanged numerous texts during this time, and based on what he told me, it seemed like a good match. He also told me that he was employed in the restaurant field.

So the day comes and we meet at a buffet place. We get our food and sit down, and then we begin really talking. He was very sweet and even made a point to say that I was beautiful and had a great smile, which was the right thing to say. However, as we delve into the real discussion, I discover that he wasn't actually working but on medical leave. I was trying to ask more specific questions to determine if he was, in fact, on medical leave or if he was using code for ""unemployed"". I couldn't get a direct answer, so I allowed the topic to shift and felt I could bring it back to the employment question a little later in the conversation.

The topic of animals came up, and I mentioned that I had three cats. He told me he had three pigs and a dog, and I was very curious about this because I had heard of people raising pigs, but I had never met one. Before I could ask any questions about his pigs, he said, ""So you'll have to excuse me cause I don't usually eat meat because of my pigs"". I was like, what?

I asked him if he was a vegetarian, and he replied that he was. He explained that when he is home, he doesn't eat any meat in front of his pigs. Since we were on a date, he felt it would be okay to eat meat on our date. He went on to say that most people come around to his way of thinking after meeting his pigs. The entire time he was talking, I was mentally asking myself how I could have missed that piece of information in his profile or in our text. Being a vegetarian is essential information. So, during his comment about not being able to eat a bacon sandwich and look at these pigs at the same time, I commented, ""Yeah, I can see how that can be awkward, especially since I LOVE bacon."" It was meant as a teasing comment, but he stopped and looked directly at me, saying very sternly, ""Not at my house!""

This utterly took me aback because I had explicitly stated that I was looking for a long-term relationship. I know he said he was too, and if he was a vegetarian and I'm not, and he has drawn a line in the sand that NO ONE can eat meat at his house, then how would this be a good match? Before I could express this thought, he had moved on and was again telling me how beautiful I was and how he was so excited to have met me, and that I was willing to give ""this unemployed man a chance""! (There's the answer to that question)

It was at this point that I had had enough, and I pulled out my wallet, telling him I needed to go home. He insisted on paying the bill, and I explained that I could pay for myself, but he insisted again. So I let him so I could get out of there. When I got home, I had received several texts from him about how much of a good time he had and how he was looking forward to another date.

It was at this time that I had to know. I texted him and asked, ""How do you see a relationship between you and me working? If you are serious about a long-term situation, then we would never be able to stay at your house, much less cohabitate if a relationship developed to that point."" He responded that he dealt with this issue at work all the time, and there isn't a problem, and that I shouldn't be so judgmental. I explained that dealing with something at work is very different than dealing with it in your home where you live. I told him I grew up on a farm, and I could very easily pet his pigs on the head WHILE eating a BLT and it wouldn't bother me. We have different values, and that's okay. With him being very direct and very clear that no one is allowed to be in his house and eat any meat, then he probably needs to seek out a vegetarian as himself. He once again said it wasn't an issue and that I was making a bigger deal out of it. I then reminded him that he stated, ""NO ONE is to eat meat in his house, and I wasn't interested in pursuing a relationship with someone where the possibility of cohabitation in the future was off the table."" He replied that cohabitation was not off the table, and there would be no problems living together if the relationship progressed to that level. I once again asked him, How do you see that happening when you won't let anyone eat meat around your pigs, and I eat meat. I don't see you getting rid of your pigs, so are you expecting me to adopt a vegetarian diet?"" He didn't respond to that and only answered that he wanted to date and thought we would be good together.

I ended the conversation right there and blocked him. A month later, the guy created a new profile and reached out to me. Before blocking him again, I took a look at his profile and there was NO mention of seeking a vegetarian partner. I just shook my head and blocked him. I just had to laugh that it wasn't the whole ""unemployed"" thing that he tried to hide from me that got him blocked, but his utter lack of awareness that his stance of ""no meat eating"" should be a part of his profile.

Before the vegetarians come after me, I don't care that he was a vegetarian. He can eat whatever he wants. But it was very clear that he didn't feel the same way about me and that he would expect ME to change what I ate. When asked directly, he wasn't man enough to even admit that was what he would expect AND he was unemployed to boot!

I really hate the dating culture today and I miss the old ways of meeting people! Good luck to all of you out there trying to find your person. I will forever remember this as the ""Great Bacon Date of 2025""!",2,1762830617.0,u_Jeleki2020,0,1.0,False

So I (20M) just started my first internship a few weeks ago. It’s my first real job, and I’ve been trying super hard to make a good impression. The other intern on my team, Sarah (20F), is really smart, confident, and honestly kind of intimidating — she knows her stuff.
Anyway, here’s where things went wrong.

Every month, “period week” was basically a sacred event in our house.

When it happened, the women of the family were off duty. Full stop. They didn’t cook, they didn’t clean, they didn’t go to school — they rested. My dad and I would take over everything.

We’d make the meals, do all the dishes, deep clean the house (my dad claimed if help with the Hormones), and deliver food straight to my mom and sisters’ beds like they were convalescing queens. My dad said it was important because “they’re losing a lot of blood, too much movement and they could pass out.”

He also swore that chocolate had medicinal properties for periods. Like, actual medicine. 
“Helps balance the hormones,” he’d say, handing me a Chocolate bar like it was Tylenol.

So yeah — I grew up sincerely believing that when a woman’s on her period, it’s a near-death experience that requires bed rest, male assistance, and cocoa-based medicine.

Sarah and I were in a team meeting, talking about our shared project, when she mentioned in passing that she got her period that morning. I, with all the confidence of a man who has no idea what he’s talking about, went full caretaker mode.

I said,“Oh no, you should take it easy today. I can handle your parts of the project.”

And then — God help me — I reached into my desk drawer, pulled out a chocolate bar I keep for snacks, and said, “Here, this’ll help with the hormones.”

The look on her face. She just stared at me for a solid five seconds before going, “Excuse me?”
And I, completely oblivious, continued, “Yeah, my mom and sisters always say it helps when their bodies are pushing out all that blood. Don’t worry, I’ll take over today so you don’t pass out or anything.”

The room went silent. Our supervisor literally choked on her coffee. Another intern started laughing so hard he had to excuse himself.
Sarah looked genuinely offended (rightfully so) and said, “You do know women can still function normally when they’re on their period, right?”

I froze. That was the exact moment I realized I’d somehow turned into the office Victorian doctor.

Later, my supervisor pulled me aside for a quick “chat.” She was trying so hard to be professional about it, but I could tell she was seconds away from laughing. She said, very carefully, “So… I heard about the chocolate situation.”

I immediately started apologizing, saying I didn’t mean to offend anyone, I just thought that was something you were supposed to do.
She nodded and said, “I appreciate the thoughtfulness, but… just to clarify, periods aren’t really something that stop women from working. They don’t actually, um, bleed out.”

I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole. I muttered something about “the hormones and the blood loss,” and she just sighed and said, “Okay. I think we’re working with some… unique family health education here.” She ended up emailing me a five-minute educational video titled “Understanding the Menstrual Cycle” with the subject line “For your professional development.”

Now the office calls me Dr. Hershey, people keep leaving chocolate bars on my desk labeled “for hormone emergencies,” and Sarah hasn’t looked me in the eye since.

so i made a post here a couple days ago and got embarrassed because i thought i was overthinking things, do i deleted it. but things have continued to get worse over the last few shifts ive had with this particular ssv.

i’ve only been at starbucks for two weeks today. i had one week of training and was sent off on my own. There’s still a lot of things i’m working on getting down and finding my rhythm, and the other partners at my store tell me i’m doing great and this job has a HUGE learning curve. 

But, i’ve run into an issue with an ssv. she’s really really mean to me, and only me. she constantly tells me i need to hurry up, nitpicks every single thing i do.. even things i know how to do, and her attitude towards me is just really really negative. i’m the only person at my location she doesn’t like. 

she shoved the coffee timer at me and said “brew, now.” and when i was on DTO (for the first time ever) she kept barking that i needed to be taking orders before i could even open my mouth to greet the customer. she was annoyed with me today when i was doing DTO because i still am not super in the flow with it yet (juggling both screens, the window, and handing out food and drinks) im still adjusting, and when i asked her for help she was like “just do it properly.” and kinda raised her voice at me not to close the window. 

my SM told me not to take things personally and coaching is just part of the job, but it feels super personal and directed.. i’ve been told by other ssvs that i’m doing great and killing it but i don’t know how to feel anymore. i feel like i want to give up just so i don’t have to work with her anymore. I don’t really care that she doesn’t like me, but she’s really unprofessional and her criticism isn’t constructive in the least, she doesn’t point me in the right direction ever, she just belittles me. 

anyway, any advice would be appreciated. i am also autistic so i don’t know if that plays a part in me just being overly sensitive or what and making a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be, but ive never been treated like this by someone who’s supposed to help me learn. thanks! 



TLDR: ssv not providing constructive criticism, just nitpicking and singling me out since i’ve worked with her. she acts very warm and kind to literally everybody else and acts super friendly to everyone but immediately shifts her attitude when i come around. any advice appreciated.

Need Your Brutal Honest Feedback!,"Yo r/bitcoin fam,I'm just a regular dude who's been diving headfirst into coding 'cause I'm obsessed with Bitcoin and wanna build stuff that makes this wild ride a bit more fun and helpful for all of us. No fancy dev background here—I've been working away for about a month now, fueled by coffee and late-night Satoshi memes. Got three little web prototypes cooking that I think could add some value (or at least some laughs) to the community. But I'm stuck: which one should I double down on? I've tested 'em out myself, but y'all are the real experts—holders, miners, noobs, and OGs alike. Hit me with your thoughts, roast 'em if they suck, or suggest epic upgrades. Let's make Bitcoin even more awesome together!Quick intros to each (links included if you wanna poke around— they're super basic right now, built with some simple tools, but hey, gotta start somewhere):

1. [Satoshi Ball](http://satoshiball-blttcixx.manus.space)
   * Basically a magic 8-ball but powered by the spirit of Satoshi. Ask it Bitcoin questions like ""Should I buy the dip?"" or ""Is this altcoin a scam?"" and it spits out cryptic, fun answers. Think oracle for your HODL decisions!
   * Why I'm hyped: It's lighthearted, could help newbies get a chuckle while learning, and who doesn't love a bit of mysticism in crypto?
   * Status: Prototype's live, but needs more polish and maybe AI smarts.
2. [Crypto Weather](http://cryptoweath-76bf8scd.manus.space)
   * A ""weather forecast"" for the Bitcoin market—sunny skies for bull runs, thunderstorms for dumps, with quick stats on price, sentiment, and news. Like checking the weather app before heading out, but for your portfolio.
   * Why I'm hyped: Makes market volatility feel less scary and more predictable, especially for folks who check charts obsessively (guilty as charged).
   * Status: Half-baked, got the basics working but wanna add real-time data feeds.
3. [Panic Button](http://cryptobtn-kkgkropo.manus.space)
   * Ever freak out during a flash crash? This is a big red button you ""press"" to get instant calming tips, meme distractions, or even quick sell alerts (but mostly to remind you to breathe and HODL). No actual trading, just anti-panic vibes.
   * Why I'm hyped: We've all been there—paper hands moments suck. This could save some sanity in the community.
   * Status: Early days, functional but could use community-suggested features like custom alerts.

So, what do ya think? Satoshi Ball for the fun factor? Crypto Weather for practical daily use? Panic Button to keep us all from rage-quitting? Or scrap 'em all and pivot to something else? I'm all ears—pros, cons, ""this reminds me of X app,"" tech tips (I'm using basic web stuff, open to suggestions), or even if you'd actually use one. Bonus points if you've got Bitcoin-specific twists to add!Thanks a bunch for reading my ramble and dropping wisdom. This sub's always inspired me—let's keep the orange pill rolling!What's your vote?

It's a huge phrase that can feel a little intimidating, right? Like you have to climb a mountain every single day. But honestly, most of the time it's not about massive leaps. It's about small, smart adjustments—the little **life optimization hacks** that stack up over time.

For me, it boils down to a few simple ideas that keep me moving forward.

**The ""One Thing"" Brain Hack** 🧠

We're constantly told to multitask, but it’s a myth. Our brains are built for focus. When I feel overwhelmed, I just ask: ""What's the *one thing* that, if I do it now, will make everything else easier?"" Sometimes it's answering that one dreaded email. Sometimes it's just tidying my desk. Focusing on that single task until it's done is like a reset button for my productivity.

**The ""Proof of Awesome"" Happiness Hack** ✨

Our brains are hardwired to notice what's wrong. To fight this, I started keeping a ""Proof of Awesome"" list. Every night, I write down *one* thing that went well. It could be big or small—crushing a workout, having a great conversation, or just making a really good cup of coffee. It forces you to hunt for the good and trains your brain to see that life is, in fact, pretty awesome.

Speaking of the emotional side of things, it’s not always easy to manage on your own. Sometimes feeling happier and less overwhelmed requires a bit more structure than just a daily list. If you're looking for something to help you map out your emotional well-being, I've had a good experience with **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**. It helped me get my thoughts in order when I felt stuck.

**The ""Tiny Momentum"" Rocket Fuel Hack** 🚀

A rocket doesn't get to space in one giant burst; it's a continuous, powerful burn. That's how I think about my goals now. Instead of ""I'm going to get fit,"" it's ""I'm going to do a 10-minute walk today.""

*   Want to start a project? Open a blank document and write a title.

These tiny actions feel almost too small to matter, but they build momentum. They are the small wins that fuel the bigger ones.

I started talking to this girl 2 weeks ago from a dating app and we hit off right away, we quickly switched over to texting and talking all day. With in the first week, we had a date set up already but the day of our date her uncle that she grew up around  passed away. She showed me memories with him so it was true not an excuse. 

Two days after her uncle passed we did a last minute date for coffee and it was a 3 hour coffee date and it was so much fun! Before we left we made our second date for this Thursday at the county fair and bought our tickets on the spot, and we continued to talk everyday. That night when she got home she texted me  even told me when we’re planning our weekend get away to relax. 

For the past 4 days though she has been slowly pulling back in texting, stopped putting emoji, her texts took longer to respond or would leave me on read. I told her if everything is ok and she said she has been feeling lost since her uncle passed away and I told her if I’m here if she needs to talk but I understand if she needs to be left alone, and I wrote a long message but she hasn’t responded all day, but she hasn’t seen the message either because she has the setting that’ll show if she read it. 

I’m not sure if I should check up if she’s ok or just wait till she texts me back, and if I wait off should I message her Thursday to see if we’re still going to the fair? I was thinking of taking her mom and her flowers I’m not sure if that’s to much if we do hang out.

My wife realized her Oura ring was missing. We checked the Oura app — last known location: our house… about five hours earlier.

We downloaded Wunderfind (that Bluetooth device finder app) and scanned everywhere — the house, both cars, the driveway. Then we literally drove a mile down and a mile back along our road — the same one she’d walked that morning — creeping along the berm hoping for a Bluetooth ping. Nothing.

Next stops: the seamstress and sub shop she’d gone to that day. Still nothing. Finally, the gas station — where her gas cap tether had broken — we searched the entire parking lot. I even went inside to ask about lost and found. Zero luck.

We eventually gave up and left town for a week.

When we came back, she made coffee like normal in her old-school percolator — filled it with water, coffee basket on top, boiled for five minutes, poured her cup.

After she finished, she went to wash the pot, dumped the leftover coffee into the sink and — CLANG.

It was the ring.

We figured out that before she’d started her day, she’d cleaned the percolator and while putting the metal parts back in, the ring must’ve slipped off into the pot. Any sound it made would’ve blended in with the rest of the clanging metal.

So it sat inside that percolator for a full week — and then survived a rolling boil of coffee.

The wild part? There was still enough battery left that it synced with the app that morning when she found it. We recharged it — and a week later it’s still working like new.

For something meant to track sleep, surviving percolator coffee is next-level durability.
Oura, if you’re reading this — you’ve built a little tank disguised as a ring. ☕💍

⸻

TL;DR: My wife lost her Oura ring. A week later, she found it at the bottom of her coffee percolator — after it had been boiled. Still works perfectly.

## The Gift Guide: Xmas Gifts for Her, Sorted by Vibe

We’ve broken down these killer gift ideas by personality type. Just find her category below and let the inspiration flow.

### ### For the Cozy Homebody

She believes the best nights are spent in, with a good book, a soft blanket, and zero pants. Her sanctuary is her home, so let's elevate it.

*   **Weighted Blanket:** More than just a blanket, it's like a constant, gentle hug. Perfect for someone who loves to de-stress and snuggle up on the couch. Look for one with a washable, removable cover.
*   **Luxury Candle Subscription:** Instead of one candle, give her a new scent to discover every month. Brands like [Scentbird](https://www.example.com/scentbird) or [Vellabox](https://www.example.com/vellabox) offer incredible, curated experiences.
*   **Silk Pillowcase & Eye Mask Set:** A touch of everyday luxury. It's better for her skin and hair, and it feels incredibly opulent. This is one of those ""I would never buy this for myself, but I adore it"" gifts.
*   **Smart Mug:** For the coffee or tea lover whose drink is always going cold. An Ember mug² keeps her beverage at the exact temperature she wants for hours. It's a game-chancer for her work-from-home routine.
*   **High-Quality Loungewear Set:** Think beyond cheap pajamas. Invest in a beautifully made set from a brand like Lunya or Eberjey. It’s a gift of comfort that she’ll feel amazing wearing.

### ### For the Tech-Savvy Trendsetter

She's the first to know about the latest gadget, and her life runs on smart tech. These gifts are for the woman who loves innovation.

*   **Portable Photo Printer:** A device like the Canon Ivy Cliq or HP Sprocket lets her print photos straight from her phone. It's perfect for creating tangible memories in an instant.
*   **Smart Jewelry:** A piece of tech that's also beautiful. Consider the Ringly smart ring or a bellabeat Leaf health tracker. It subtly notifies her of calls and texts while tracking her wellness.
*   **Wireless Charging Valet:** A sleek, all-in-one station that charges her phone, watch, and earbuds without a mess of cables. It keeps her nightstand tidy and her tech ready to go.
*   **Aerial Drone:** For the adventurous spirit! A beginner-friendly drone like the DJI Mini series opens up a whole new world of photography and fun.
*   **Voice Assistant with a Smart Screen:** An Amazon Echo Show or Google Nest Hub is more than a speaker. She can use it for video calls, following recipes, watching videos, and controlling her smart home devices with her voice.

### ### For the Creative Soul

Her hands are always busy making something beautiful. From painting to pottery, she expresses herself through her craft.

*   **MasterClass Subscription:** Give her access to online classes taught by world-renowned experts in their fields. She can learn cooking from Gordon Ramsay, writing from Margaret Atwood, or filmmaking from Martin Scorsese.
*   **High-End Art Supplies:** If she's a painter, get her a set of professional-grade paints or brushes from a brand like Winsor & Newton. If she sketches, a beautiful leather-bound sketchbook and a set of fine-tip pens will be treasured.
*   **DIY Pottery Kit:** Let her get her hands dirty with an at-home pottery kit. It comes with everything she needs to create her own small pieces, from the clay to the sculpting tools and paint.
*   **A Modern Calligraphy Set:** This elegant hobby is both relaxing and productive. Look for a complete kit that includes a variety of nibs, a pen holder, ink, and practice pads.
*   **A ""Creative Retreat"" Day:** The best gift isn't always a thing. Plan a day for her to be alone and create. Book a hotel room for a night, pack her supplies, and let her have uninterrupted time to work on her passion project.

### ### For the Wellness Guru

Her self-care routine is non-negotiable. She's all about mindfulness, movement, and treating her body like a temple.

*   **Theragun Mini:** The holy grail of muscle recovery. This pocket-sized percussive therapy device is perfect for working out knots after a workout or a long day at her desk.
*   **Acupressure Mat:** It looks like a bed of nails, but it's an incredible tool for relieving tension, improving circulation, and encouraging deep relaxation.
*   **Hydrogen Water Bottle:** For the friend who has everything. This trendy tech-infuses water with molecular hydrogen, which some studies suggest has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
*   **A High-Quality Yoga Mat:** If her current mat is slipping and sliding, upgrade it to a luxurious, non-slip, eco-friendly option from a brand like Liforme or Manduka.
*   **Sunrise Simulation Alarm Clock:** A gentler way to wake up. This clock gradually brightens to simulate a natural sunrise, which can help regulate her sleep-wake cycle and make mornings less jarring.

### ### For the One Who Deserves a Little Luxury

She works hard, and she deserves to be spoiled. These gifts feel opulent, special, and utterly indulgent.

*   **Designer Wallet or Cardholder:** A small but significant luxury. A beautiful leather piece from a brand like Kate Spade, Tory Burch, or even a classic Gucci or Prada adds a touch of class to her daily life.
*   **Personalized Jewelry:** Go beyond a simple necklace. Consider a custom birthstone ring, a bracelet engraved with a meaningful date or coordinates, or a locket with tiny photos inside. Brands like Mejuri and Catbird are fantastic for this.
*   **A Classic Fragrance:** A signature scent is the ultimate luxury gift. Go to a high-end department store and get her a classic from Chanel, Dior, or Byredo. For a more personal touch, find a local perfumery that offers scent profiling.
*   **Cashmere Sweater:** The epitome of cozy, timeless luxury. A well-made cashmere sweater in a neutral color like camel, grey, or black is a wardrobe staple she'll have for years.
*   **Wine or Whiskey Tasting Experience:** An experiential gift is often more memorable than a physical object. Book a private tasting for two at a local vineyard or high-end whiskey bar.

## Still Stuck? Think About These Pro Tips

If you've scrolled through this list and still feel unsure, take a breath. The best gift doesn't have to be the most expensive.

1.  **Become a Detective:** Pay attention in the weeks leading up to Christmas. What does she complain about? (""My headphones always die!"") What does she admire? (""Oh, that's a beautiful bag!""). These are your biggest clues.
2.  **Focus on Experiences:** Research shows that experiences often bring more lasting happiness than material possessions. Concert tickets, a cooking class, a weekend getaway, or even a fancy dinner out can be the most cherished gift of all.
3.  **When in Doubt, Personalize It:** A personal touch transforms a good gift into a great one. A simple photo book of your memories together, a framed print of a special place, or an item engraved with her initials shows thoughtfulness that no store-bought item can replicate.

Happy hunting! Finding the right Xmas gifts for her is all about showing her how well you know her. You've got this.",1,1762828656.0,JollyDecorAndGifts,0,1.0,False

1otxv2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1otxv2h/im_30m_lost_2_years_with_my_wife_42f_and_we_are/,I’m (30M) lost.. 2 years with my wife (42F) and we are separating..,"So, long story..

I fell head over heels in love with a woman. She reminded me so much of my first love and had a wonderful charming sweet personality. She made me feel loved and cared for.. she even said once “youve been neglected, havent you?” And brought me to tears..

We immediately fell in love. I was so happy to have her.. we shared with each other our disabilities and we vowed to always work around abd help each other with our disabilities.

Then a few more weeks in- I told her that I was VERY sensitive, and cry very easily.. and that I will never be a rich man probably, but I am full of love and a loyal to a fault.. she told me that she had anger issues, and some mental health issues. We agreed to work around those as well. 

Anyways, a few months In- I start to notice slight verbal abuse, but nothing crazy. Mostly just pointing out that I do dumb stuff or making a snarky comment about it. I am book smart, but I lack common sense, and can be very absent minded. I don’t do it on purpose- it’s just me. But I notice the small things I accidentally do- seem to trigger her and make her act different… anyways- I acknowledge no one is perfect, and deal with that no problem. I have a good ability to laugh stuff off, or can find humor in the silly situations my absent mindedness gets me in..

In October she started wanted a new car for some reason. She did have a car, but she decided she wanted a new one. We went to. Couple dealerships- and I even tried to sign with her, but we couldn’t get approved immediately without a down payment and that upset her a lot… one day she goes down with her sister to a dealership for her sister to get a new car.. and then on the way home she starts texting me that she’s really sad and wants to commit suicide.. I beg her not to… I tell her it’ll be okay. I tell her that she can always use my car as much as she ever needs, that it’s just as much hers as it is mine… she responds, “no it’s not. If it was mine, I’d have traded it in already.” Then she texts me “I was going to drive off the cliff but I had to miss the turn so my sister didn’t get lost” because they were following each other… I get very upset because my girlfriend wants to commit suicide.. I end up just offering for her to trade in the car, but I couldn’t afford the payments so she would probably have to get rid of her other car… she gets happy and agrees.. after we get the new car (which my mother actually helps us sign for so we get a good rate) she says “your happy ***** is back,” 

Few weeks later I propose to her at the place of our first date. She accepts.. I feel so happy. I feeel like I’ve secured the love I lost with my first love..

Few weeks go by- she starts texting her most recent bf a lot. Constant texting, good morning texts, pet names.. all that. I had made it very clear that I’m monogamous.. I’ve been cheated on a whole lot in the past… I told her I didn’t like it at all, but she said it was nothing and she loved me.. she asks to go out for a girls night twice that month. We share location- so I do notice where she is.. 

Fast forward past her marriage, and getting a house with my mother and my family, she is having an outing with a group of friends that include this “most recent ex” and she ends up at that address she went to twice for “girls night”. And out of curiosity I ask her where she is. She said “exs house, I did not know they wanted to meet up her..” later I confront her about the addresses and she denies it and calls me crazy.. then a few months later she starts asking to go hang out along with this ex at his house. That is way too much for me. I’m not comfortable with that. I tried to set a boundary.. she told me I was controlling, insecure, and did not trust her, and that she wanted to divorce me… so I gave up and just let her go… (3 times total in the relationship).. I just didn’t see the reason for her to go over there for “coffee” or to have dinner.. he’s an ex for fucks sake, treat him like one..

At this point the word divorce is almost daily in her vocabulary and I cry almost every day because of it.. we come to a point where she starts to anger towards my family. Sends a passive aggressive group text message to the entire family saying no one helped us “clean”… she sent it as my mom was pulling in with groceries.. after she was done working her 2nd job that she had been pulling to try to keep up with all the new bills.. mom comes in, the room, and says “it seems like your upset, …” before she can finish. My wife starts saying I a very loud voice “hell yeah I’m upset”.. my mom replies, “are you yelling at me?” And she replies (in a yelling voice) “THIS IS ME YELLING”… mom walks out, and we end up in a text message war.. and while mom does try to make things work, it ends up not working and she moves out, about a month or two after the incident..

We move out into our own apartment… the abuse that has turned physical at this point is increasing. At this point I’ve been choked, slapped, pushed, kicked, punched, headbutted, target practice, all sorts of things.. I still fight to stay with her, even though she threatens me with divorce and breaks me down every day…

Well without support from my mom, and my wife quitting her job because she was sick of it- my usual income of Lyft driving and my disability check was no longer enough.. I started working another job at a call center on top of this.. 

I am 8 months into my job. She’s just started working again because we were struggling even with me lyfting, working a 40hr week, and a disability check, it wasn’t enough. 

Anyways 2 Fridays ago- we had a blow up. She went to the doctor, and the doctor did tell her that the stress she’s under could cause a flare up. She got mad at me about this. She said that my bad providing and my mom’s fight has caused her so much stress that I’m causing her to be miserable, and need to be hospitalized. Then she tells me I also don’t do nearly enough housework to keep things manageable for her… every single day I came home after working 2 jobs, and cooked dinner, took out trash, did more laundry, dealt with my sons homework, bath, put him to bed.. I literally never stop. I don’t play video games anymore. I haven’t played cards with friends in years. No more jam sessions. I put all my effort into this relationship and our life… and she tells me I don’t do enough.. 

Now know I still have never called her a bitch, or anything like that, I have tried to never do anything except call her “mean.” But I lost it. I started yelling. We were on face time. I said “I don’t want this anymore, it’s not fair. I’m sorry that I make you so miserable. If I make you this miserable, I’ll stay OUT of your life” I hung up, thee my phone in the backseat. I was over it then. I wanted to be done… she had finally pushed me there. I had been taunted with divorce for so long, and fought against it, and now I was the one that wanted it. I went back inside from my lunch break and told my employer what was going on.. they gave me the rest of the day off.

The next week actually goes half smoothly.. I mean she still did threaten to leave me, but there weren’t any HUGE fights.. until this past Friday again. I woke up early to go make a little bit of money that we needed to finish paying this month’s rent. I woke up super early. I noticed the dog peed in the floor. I started. Leaning it after getting ready. I told my wife. She said “wow, she wouldn’t have if you would have walked her like you were supposed too.” I ignore it and keep cleaning, but she gets up- in a bad mood, and says “I’ll clean it, you don’t do it right.” .. so I just step aside and respect her. She’s giving me commands and things to do while she cleans it, and I said “ok” in the most plain neutral way I could’ve said it and I hear “Oh, so we’ve got an attitude now? Asshole.” And I know that the day is goo to be crap… she’s in an awful mood. I kiss her bye and go to work. She seemed to have calmed down a bit- but not even 1 or 2 miles down the road I get a text “I’m unhappy” “I want a divorce..”.. I start crying and type back …… . She said “boy, bye. Don’t come home.”.. she says something like so I need to leave or will you? And I said I’ll come pack my stuff… I go home and start packing. She says “all this because you just had to be an asshole.” And I was a smartass and said “all this because your dog peed in the floor.” She comes storming down the hall and shoved me into the kitchen sink. I fall back but catch myself on the corner. I start screaming “Ah” and trying to get past her. She bear hugs me and starts hushing me… I squirm freee and go towards the door and just pace and freak out for a few. I get really anxious when she gets physical towards me…. She eventually calms me down and convinces me to stay. While we are sitting there talking, she begins to sob and say she wants to take all her pills and kill herself. I cry too and tell her it’s terrible and I hope she never does that. We talk, and while she’s still sad, she tables the suicidal talk, and I put the pills up. I have to go to my actual job now- in which I e taken so much time off for her mental health, that I don’t have any remaining “missed time” and even being late gets me fired. So I cannot stick around to keep cheering her up, and I know she has to work very soon anyways. So I kiss her bye and head to work. When I’m at work, she starts saying that I left her to die. She says “what kind of husbands leaves their wives the way I felt”. I keep telling her “if you want me to quit and come home, I will, but if I leave I will lose my job. Is that okay?” And she wouldn’t answer it. I’m not making your decisions… all day fighting and her making me feel bad, and I quit my job for her. Which makes me feel AWFUL. They were so good to me, and it felt good to have that extra money, AND I felt accomplished. But I did it for her… and she still wasn’t grateful. She just kept hanging the fact that I didn’t go it before work or on my lunch break. She says since it took since my last break, that it really didn’t matter..

Anyways fast forward two more days to today. She made me stay home from Lyft when I woke up super early. I was having a good time chatting with her cause she was awake and seemed to be I.  Good mood! So I stood and talked a few minutes.. and she was like GO OR STAY stop TEASING me, then got up and said guess I’m going to, even though I don’t fucking want too. So I told her just to get back in bed and we weren’t going and I stayed.. 

She starts working. Doesn’t feel good. I call and make her a doctors appointment. It’s time to leave. I put my jacket on. She asks me “is my jacket OUT THERE?” I glance around the living room? Didn’t see it.. glanced around the dining room, didn’t see it, and she freaks out “what’s taking you so long?!?, obviously it’s not there and it’s in the closet dumbass.” “This is why I don’t want to be with you. This is why I want divorce.”… then in the car on the way to the doctor she starts in on the “you left me alone while I wanted to kill myzelf” “you left me to die”… and I just start bawling again. She’s yelling T me, which one of us is packing and leaving? And I said me, and I packed, and I called my mom which I’m so surprised she came to help after the way things turned out, and left…

I’m sitting here now, and can’t help but think of the good times, the butterflies, the laughs, the adventures, the sweet way she used to say my name, her sweet voice, her beautiful warm eyes.. and it takes all I have to hold myself together. Why after all this, why do I still miss her so bad, and want to hear her say something sweet to me? Why do I want to hear her tell me that she loves me? Why am I dying inside because I’m not checking on her? 

I’m so lost.. I’m so sad… I’ve been beaten down and abused, and I’m still longing for her…. Is it worth fighting for? Do abusers ever change?.. or do I just be sad and forget? 

Any guidance anyone?

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in



I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline",1,1762828602.0,BlockbusterTVSeries,1,1.0,False

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline",1,1762828572.0,BlockbusterTVSeries,1,1.0,False

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in



I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in



I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

# [✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://appbitly.com/MeBQd)

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline",1,1762828508.0,BlockbusterTVSeries,1,1.0,False
1otxsul,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1otxsul/my_sibo_wasnt_actually_sibo_it_was_my_thyroid_the/,My SIBO wasn't actually SIBO - it was my thyroid the whole time (and 15 naturopaths missed it),"If you're reading this at 3am googling ""why does rifaximin only work for 5 days"" or ""SIBO keeps coming back,"" I need you to hear something that took me over a decade and $12,000 to figure out.

Your SIBO might not be the problem. It might be the symptom.

I've been where you are. The endless rounds of rifaximin that work like magic until day 5 post-treatment when everything crashes back. The herbals (oregano oil, berberine, allicin) that give you hope for two weeks before the bloating returns with a vengeance. The restrictive diets that make you feel like a social pariah while barely moving the needle on your symptoms.

My health journey started at 28 when I developed alopecia totalis, complete hair loss, eyebrows and all, practically overnight. That crisis sent me down the functional medicine rabbit hole. Since then, I've seen 15+ naturopaths (only 2-3 were actually helpful), multiple gastroenterologists, various functional medicine doctors, nutritionists, acupuncturists, and ""gut health coaches.""

I tried every protocol this subreddit mentions. Things like elemental diet (done it twice). Low FODMAP became my personality. I have spreadsheets tracking my reactions to 200+ foods. I spent $800 on SIBO breath tests alone, watching my hydrogen levels bounce between 45 and 80 ppm no matter what I did.

The most frustrating part was for years, my thyroid labs were ""normal."" TSH bounced between 2.0-2.5, free T4 right in the middle of the range. Every doctor looked at those numbers and moved on to prescribe another round of gut-focused treatment. Meanwhile, I had Hashimoto's antibodies through the roof, but they kept saying my thyroid function was ""fine.""

Here's where things got interesting for me:

Last year, during perimenopause hormone testing, I specifically sought out an endocrinologist who specialized in women's hormones and thyroid conversion issues, something I learned about from digging through PubMed at 2am. She noticed something odd. My TSH had dropped to 1.2 (still ""normal""), but I had all the hypothyroid symptoms. Brain fog so thick I couldn't remember my coworkers' names, hair falling out in clumps (again), feeling hungover every morning without drinking, needing 3 cups of coffee just to form sentences. My partner would want to do things and I'd be too exhausted to even consider leaving the couch.

She ran a full thyroid panel including free T3, reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies. My free T3 was at the absolute bottom of the range. The pattern suggested central hypothyroidism with a T4 to T3 conversion problem. Basically, my body was making thyroid hormone but couldn't convert it to the active form my cells actually use.

She suggested I run my existing 23andMe raw data through a health interpretation service to check for conversion issues. Sure enough, I have the DIO2 variant that impairs T4 to T3 conversion, particularly in the brain and muscles. My Hashimoto's wasn't just attacking my thyroid. It was part of a bigger pattern where my body literally couldn't use the thyroid hormone it was making.

Why does this matter for SIBO - I hear you asking.

Thyroid hormone directly controls the migrating motor complex (MMC), those cleaning waves that sweep bacteria out of your small intestine. It also controls stomach acid production, digestive enzyme release, intestinal motility, and bile flow.

When your thyroid isn't functioning properly, your entire digestive system slows down. Food sits longer, bacteria have more time to ferment, and the normal cleaning mechanisms fail. You develop SIBO not because you have ""bad"" bacteria, but because your system can't maintain proper bacterial geography.

The KEY here is Standard thyroid treatment (levothyroxine/Synthroid) only provides T4, which my body couldn't convert. I needed T3 support specifically.

Started on compounded slow-release T3. It took three dose adjustments over two months to find my sweet spot (started at 2.5mcg, now at 5mcg twice daily). Added selenium, zinc, and tyrosine to support conversion. Within 3 weeks, my morning ""hangover"" feeling was gone. I was actually having bowel movements without coffee. Bloating reduced by maybe 50%. Brain fog starting to lift. I had energy to actually do things with my partner again.

The bloating took longer, probably 6-8 weeks to really improve. Still have bad days, especially around my cycle. At week 8, I retested for SIBO. Hydrogen was 12 ppm. First negative result since my thirties. Had to retest it because I didn't believe it.

The restrictive diets I'd been following were actually making my thyroid worse. Carbohydrates are essential for T4 to T3 conversion. Every time I went low-carb or did another elimination diet, I was sabotaging my thyroid function and perpetuating the cycle.

The autoimmune protocol that was supposed to heal my gut? It tanked my already struggling thyroid. My body needs those carbs, especially during perimenopause when hormone fluctuations already stress the thyroid.

I'm not saying everyone with SIBO has a thyroid issue. But if you're stuck in the treatment-relapse cycle, consider looking upstream:

**Get comprehensive thyroid testing:**

* TSH, free T4, free T3, reverse T3
* Thyroid antibodies (TPO, thyroglobulin) - especially if you have Hashimoto's
* First morning basal body temperature (under 97.8°F suggests low thyroid)
* Consider genetic testing for thyroid conversion variants

**Check related markers:**

* Ferritin (low iron impairs thyroid function)
* Vitamin D
* B12 and folate
* Selenium and zinc

**Question the connections:**

* Did your SIBO start during a stressful period?
* Do you have other hormone issues (PCOS, perimenopause, low testosterone)?
* Is your body temperature always cold?
* Do you have a family history of thyroid issues or autoimmune conditions?

After all these years of treating the bacteria as the enemy, I finally understood they were just opportunists in a slowed system. Fix the system, and the bacteria sort themselves out.

I still take digestive enzymes and a prokinetic (ginger/artichoke), but I'm eating normally again. Real pasta. Actual bread. Vegetables that aren't just ""low FODMAP approved."" My last three breath tests have been negative.

We get so focused on killing bacteria that we miss the bigger picture. Your gut doesn't exist in isolation. If you've tried everything and nothing sticks, maybe it's time to look beyond the small intestine.

After all this, I wanted people to know that the solution might be hiding in those ""normal"" lab ranges that aren't normal for you.",75,1762828457.0,SIBO,21,0.97,False

# first things first, let's line up the facts / info we have:

☑️ Jillian and Riley were in a relationship up until at least end of August 2024 (*romantic trip to italy in April 2024 where her post still shows up in his tagged posts, but his profile doesn‘t show up as tagged on her profile anymore. Both were tagged in a post and were posing in pics together from the same trip / wedding on August 24, 2024*)

☑️ Jillian met Vinnie in **October 2024**, but they were ‚*just friends back then*‘, however Jillian allegedly mentioned on a live stream that Vinnie *'tried to make a move on her'* back then already

☑️ Jillian mentioned on her **letterboxd** review on **June 22, 2025** that she‘s *'missing her soulmate'* who at that time was *'traveling on the other side of the world'*

☑️ Jillian also mentioned in the same review that she has a *'special connection with someone'* she met 11 years ago, had *'instances of crossing paths in between'*, AND *'finally reconnected'* with in 2024. And she ended the review with *‚if u are reading this i miss u come home </3‘*

☑️ **on June 22, 2025**, Vinne was in Toronto for a Valorant event and spent quite some time with Sabrina Olaso

(🖇️ check here for more info [https://www.reddit.com/r/jillianbrennasnark/comments/1oq735c/jillian\_no\_one\_wants\_your\_man\_you\_had\_him\_because/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jillianbrennasnark/comments/1oq735c/jillian_no_one_wants_your_man_you_had_him_because/), 🖇️ link to the Tiktok Sabrina posted back then on her second account [https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdKrWCGH/](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdKrWCGH/))

☑️ Jillian then mentioned on **June 30, 2025** in a seperate **letterboxd** review that she‘s using her *‚bf‘s netflix‘* who was gone for two weeks and then complained about her *'f\*cking up'* his algorithm.

☑️ It looks like around **June 30, 2025**, Vinnie also came back from his Toronto / Paris trip

☑️ On multiple occasions Jillian claimed Vinnie and her got closer in July

☑️ **Vinnie** made his **own letterboxd** account on **July 23, 2025**, wrote two half assed reviews, did **not** like any of Jillians reviews, did **not** follow Jillians account, **followed some dude named Frank**, logged off and was **never active on the platform again**

☑️ Vinnies stream that confirmed their relationship was on **September 17, 2025**, claiming their one month anniversary would be the next day, making the official **start of their relationship August 18**

☑️ Around the time of Vinnies September 17 stream, Jillian got called out for her obsessive letterboxd reviews, and she was quick to **delete and alter** certain parts:  
she deleted ~~the entire soulmate and backstory part~~ on her **June 22** review, including the ~~‚i miss u’~~ at the end, and on her **June 30** review, she changed ~~‚i use my bf‘s netflix‘~~ to *‚i used someone else‘s netflix‘* and the ~~‚he said‘~~ to *‚they said‘*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# So what was up with these letterboxd reviews?

**After gathering all these contradicting infos and breaking them down, there's two main possibilities...**

1️⃣ either the letterboxd reviews in June were 100% about Vinnie 

2️⃣ or there was a third person, a guy that was NOT Riley but that she was obsessed with and actually met 11 years ago, and maybe all these reviews in June weren‘t about Vinnie at all

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Let's explore these possibilities, compare them to the facts that we have, and do a little deep dive...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1️⃣ **POSSIBILITY 1**: ""the letterboxd reviews in June were about Vinnie and Vinnie only""

✅ **what would speak FOR this:** 

💭 *the theory of her being completely delusional:*

* they could’ve hooked up much earlier than July with no strings attached, and Jillian could’ve fantasized about Vinnie being her ‚bf‘ and ‚soulmate‘ as early as June, while they weren’t exclusive yet and Vinnie was still getting involved with Sabrina
* she could’ve made up an entire red string theory / backstory with Vinnie that wasn’t real
* she could've exaggerated on the *‚other side of the world‘* part or even meant his following Paris visit
* Vinnie returned from his Toronto / Paris trip around June 30 so it would line up with the *‚he came back from traveling for two weeks‘* in her review from that day
* the *‚if u are reading this i miss u come home </3‘* part and calling him her *‚bf’* and *'soulmate'* look especially creepy in this context because if they weren't an official thing back then, I highly doubt she would have wanted for him to genuinely read these things, she must have written them more for herself
* so when she got called out for those obsessive sounding reviews, she deleted those exact parts because they were about Vinnie, and Vinnie wasn't supposed to know, and she was scared he would see and notice how obsessed and weird she was ~~(But Vinnie made a letterboxd account on July 23, so if she was in panic about what he might think, wouldn't she have altered these reviews much earlier?)~~

💭 *the theory of some actual conspiracy happening that BOTH of them are in on:*

* they both could have been hooking up and mutually calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend since June, and she could‘ve actually posted the review for Vinnie to see (~~despite the fact that he only got his own account in July and didn‘t interact with her account or reviews at all~~)
* if that’s the case, there must be some big and good reason for them both to hold back the info about an acutal past with each other 11 years ago and in between (~~but then why would she write about it on a public platform in the first place only to delete it after?~~)

❌ **what would CONTRADICT this:** 

💬 *the fact that people have doubted their connection and relationship in terms of hurriedness and authenticity since the beginning*

* if they truly had any prior connection, let alone 11 years ago, and had crossed paths in between, they would‘ve said so. It would have made them look more established, more organic / meaningful and authentic. They made it no secret they were friends since October 2024, why would they not admit to an even longer history?

💬 *the fact that Jillians repeated pattern is to make things sound bigger and more meaningful als they are*

* If there was more substance behind their relationship, she wouldn‘t suddenly hold that info back

💬 *the fact that Vinnie was in Toronto*

* Vinnie wasn‘t on the ‚other side of the world‘ on June 22, and you‘d think while being a hopelessly romantic and dramatic person, Jill would have enough knowledge about geography since she‘s been outside of america and even to europe a few times 😭

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2️⃣ **POSSIBILITY 2:** ""the letterboxd review was about a third person / love interest""

✅ **what would speak FOR this:** 

💭 *the theory that Riley might have already been out of the picture since August / September ish 2024?*

* so there was possibly a bit of a gap before she met Vinnie and could've gotten involved with somebody else

💬 *the fact that Vinnie and her never confirmed meeting 11 years ago or in any way earlier than October 2024*

💭 *the theory that it could've been some type of long friendship turned friends with benefits / situationship that had no official relationship label but made her feel a limerence and sense of destiny similar to what she's now expressing with Vinnie*

* if it was a situationship, the 'bf' on her letterboxd review on June 30 could also mean 'best friend'? would fit with the '11 years ago' 'soulmate' narrative
* the *'finally reconnecting'* in 2024 could be about them if they came back into her life between the break up with Riley and the first encounter with Vinnie
* the entire *'red string theory'* part would make sense then
* that would mean she was still with that person in June, using their Netflix, not Vinnies
* according to that theory she would've literally been involved with Vinnie AND said person at the same time to some degree and there WOULD have been some kind of overlap

💬 *the fact that despite already meeting in October, Vinnie and her were 'just friends' until July*

* if Vinnie 'tried to make a move on her in October' like Jillian allegedly claimed once, why would she have hesitated?
* either she was still too involved with that other person and actually felt some loyalty
* OR that claim is false / she was trying to make things seem bigger as they were once again and Vinnie DID NOT show actual romantic interest in her back then, so she stayed in that other 'situationship' for a while

💬 *the fact that Vinnie was spending an alarming amount of time with Sabrina Olaso in Toronto while Jillian wrote her 'I miss u come home </3' note*

* the entire situation on Vinnies end would make more sense and would have been more acceptable if Jillian had someone else at that time, too

💬 *the fact that Vinnie made his own letterboxd account but did not care about Jillians reviews or her profile at all*

💬 *the fact that Jillian deleted and altered those exact parts in her letterboxd reviews right after being called out in public, NOT right after Vinnie made an account of his own*

* maybe they were never about Vinnie or written for him to read, and she only changed them because she didn‘t want more of his fans to come to that false conclusion
* or maybe she didn‘t want his audience to find out there was somebody else she was obsessed with right before she got with Vinnie, because it would've only made her look even worse

❌ **what would CONTRADICT this:** 

💬 *the fact that there's no sign of a third love interest ever existing on her social media*

* was there never any evidence because it was a very one sided thing and the other person didn't want to make it public? Or did she delete all the evidence before she got involved with Vinnie?

💬 *the fact that she's very opportunistic and Vinnie most probably has much more followers and opportunities to offer than any third person in her environment*

* it doesn't really make sense that she would turn Vinnie down to stay in a situationship if Vinnie actually made a move on her as early as October 2024
* if that's the case, she must have really felt a deep obsession with that third person
* but if she met that other person 11 years ago and believed in the red string theory with them, that might have made her want to hold on to it for a while

💬 *the fact that the person was allegedly traveling the 'other side of the world' for two weeks*

* if the third person was also traveling at the same time as Vinnie was in Toronto / Paris, it would admittedly be a huge coincidence

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# 🚩After exploring both possibilities, I don‘t know what‘s more of a red flag. 🚩

1️⃣ **saying all that about Vinnie and romantically addressing him without him actually reading or acknowledging it** (he had no account back then and didn't even like the review later on when he made one) **- and either blatantly lying and being delusional about a mutual backstory or the backstory being true, but both of them are for some reason trying to sweep it under the rug now**

OR

2️⃣ **Having a third person besides Riley and Vinnie to call her soulmate and tie the red string theory to and use their Netflix in June, then getting closer to Vinnie while still being involved with them, only to then toss it all overboard in the span of a month because Vinnie, the person with more following and opportunities, was suddenly ready to commit to her**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Or maybe the truth is somewhere in between?

3️⃣ **POSSIBILITY 3:** ""her daydreaming about and mentioning two different connections in the same letterboxd review.""

# oh look, the flag got even redder 🚩🚩🚩🚩

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# what do you think? 🤔

I’ve learned from struggle, and I carry that with humility. I’m drawn to someone genuine, curious, and grounded, someone who believes connection is built slowly, through shared laughter, patience, and care.

**Five important characteristics about me:** 

* Emotionally warm and grounded: someone who can hold space for both silence and conversation, who doesn’t rush to fix but listens to understand.
* Genuine and empathetic: kind not just in words, but in small, consistent actions that show care.
* Intellectually curious: someone who loves to think deeply, explore ideas, and have conversations that go beyond the surface.
* Communicative and steady: values honesty and emotional transparency, yet knows when to be gentle and patient.
* Values growth and connection: sees love as a journey of mutual evolution, not perfection; someone who’s willing to grow together through both joy and struggle.

**Level of religiosity:** 

I practice Hinduism with a spiritual, reflective approach. My faith in God has been a quiet source of strength, and I’m deeply grateful for the kindness life has shown me. Growing up in the diverse, cultured neighborhoods of Dhaka taught me to value respect and openness toward all faiths and ways of life.

**Level of education and preference:** 

I am drawn to someone educated, with at least a bachelor’s degree, who is intellectually curious, witty, and thoughtful enough to hold conversations that flow with both depth and warmth. 

**Current job status:** 

PhD candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at a leading research university in the southern United States.

**Do you want kids:** 

Yes, hopefully someday. I sometimes dream of a future where my first child is a daughter, a thought that always fills me with quiet warmth.

**Hobbies and Interests:** 

I enjoy reading, writing, and cooking; they help me slow down and stay grounded. I’m passionate about fitness and long walks that clear the mind. I love meaningful conversations, exploring psychology and spirituality, and finding calm in simple things, such as a cup of coffee, good music, or watching the sunset after a long day.

**Something interesting about me:** 

I’m the kind of person who gets equally excited about a deep research idea and a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. I can lose track of time discussing psychology, philosophy, or why Dhaka feels so nostalgic. I’m a bit of a nerd, in a good way, of course; thoughtful, curious, and always up for a conversation that starts serious and ends in laughter.

**What I am looking for in a partner:** 

I’m drawn to someone kind, emotionally intelligent, and grounded, someone who values depth, warmth, and honest communication. I admire a woman who’s educated, curious, and passionate about her own path, yet finds joy in life’s quieter moments. Above all, I’m looking for a connection built on mutual respect, patience, and growth, where both inspire each other to become better and more whole.

**Preferred mode of contact:**

1otxn6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1otxn6n/minimal_effort_maximum_return_heres_what_actually/,Minimal effort. Maximum return. Here's what actually works,"I'm tired of complicated optimization advice. Here are the simple changes that genuinely transformed my life with almost zero effort:

Walk everywhere (seriously, design your life around this)

Move close to work, groceries, gym whatever matters to you. Walking is the most underrated life hack. Free therapy. Free exercise. Free thinking time. No traffic stress. No parking anxiety. Just automatic daily movement and mental clarity. This one change fixed my health, my mood, and my bank account.

Earplugs ($2 investment that changed everything)

Best money I've ever spent. Deep sleep even with noise. Focus in chaos. Peace on planes, trains, coffee shops. Your environment is constantly stealing your attention and rest. Two dollars solves it. Keep a pair everywhere nightstand, bag, desk.

Notifications off. All of them. Always.

This is non-negotiable. Every notification is someone else's priority interrupting yours. Your phone should be a tool you use, not a leash that controls you. Turn off every badge, banner, and buzz. Check things when YOU decide, not when an app demands it. This alone will reclaim hours of focus.

Remove negative associations with yourself

Stop calling yourself lazy, stupid, undisciplined, or any other label that reinforces failure. Your brain believes what you repeatedly tell it. Every time you say ""I'm bad at this"" you're training yourself to be bad at it. Rewrite the narrative. You're not lazy, you're learning better systems. You're not stupid, you're building new skills. Words shape identity.

Pocket notebook (just trust me on this)

Carry a small notebook everywhere. Not for journaling or perfect notes. For capturing thoughts before they disappear. Ideas. Tasks. Random observations. Things you need to remember. Getting it out of your head and onto paper frees up mental RAM. Phones don't work for this too many distractions. Paper is instant and focused.

Why these work:

They're all one-time decisions with permanent benefits. You don't need daily willpower or motivation. Set it once, gain forever. No apps to maintain. No habits to track. Just structural changes that automatically improve your life.

Most self-improvement advice is exhausting. ""Wake up at 5 AM! Meditate! Journal! Track macros! Cold showers!"" These things work sure. But they require constant effort.

These five things only need minimal ongoing effort. Maximum return. Just tiny adjustments that quietly compound into a completely different quality of life.

Here what I observed, most netizens are just stereotype her nationality, and that's it, case closed? The video was posted by her, of course we can identify her based on the source of the video, understand who she is, and what made her behaving like this.
That's the problem if we're too much stereotyping a perpetrator and categorizing whole nationality, then justice won't be served, and those innocent behaving people from that nationality will feel unfair and distanced from tending with the public.
If the perpetrator is a Malaysian or Singaporean, of course netizens will expose her and made her remorse about consequence of her misbehaviour. If we stop stereotyping and really put effort to understand her identity and what led her to this, actually 99.9% people from that nationality who are behaving and friendly all the time, will feel grateful and stand with us.
Let make a peaceful world and let those misdemeanors feel shameful about their aggressive behaviour. Also we should also practice forgiveness and give chance for her rehab of her anger management issue before she return to us as part of society.",0,1762827802.0,Bolehland,7,0.36,False

I recently took the XPT train from Sydney to Melbourne and was pleasantly surprised to find vegan options available on board.

I honestly did not expect there to be any, so I had packed a few snacks just in case.

For breakfast, they offered a coconut curry pie ($7), and for lunch, a Thai green curry with rice ($13.50). The pie was good, lunch was ..Edible.

There were other snacks as well: cut fruit and carrot, celery, hummus boxes. Didn't get those. 

The crew were lovely and very helpful.

1otxj2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1otxj2f/i_have_overwhelming_social_anxiety_and_i_cant/,"I have overwhelming social anxiety, and i can’t take it anymore.","(21 y/o guy). Idk what do to anymore. I have horrible social anxiety when I’m out alone. I can barely go into fcking walmart to get a fee things. It’s gotten so damn bad, and im really scared. I’ve never dated, am im not sure I’m ever going to be able too anymore. I can’t even look strangers in the eyes. 

Literally yesterday, i went to Walmart to get just green tea, coffee, trail mix, and jello-chocolate pudding mix for my sister, since my parents for got to get it. I sat there in my car in the parking lot, trying to be convinced that i’m okay, people or are just people and everyone is too busy focused on themselves to really give a damn about focusing on me. I felt alright up until i got to the doors, because past that threshold theres obviously a ton of people, and my mind immediately started wanting to run away, bad. I’ve been trying to work on both trying to ignore the feeling, or just trying to sit with it and go about my business with it lingering and present. So like usual i just go in, trying to be a normal person. It eventually gets so overwhelming, very quickly. I felt myself going stiff, and getting warm and physically irritated all over, and my eyes trying to water. I kinda semi-hid in an empty isle for a bit, trying to distract myself with whatever, and try and take some good breaths to try and steady damn nerves. I thought i brought my mental to a decent enough state to try again, but as soon as I left the isle, it came back. I did this a few times, and just pushed myself throughout the whole process. I tried repeatedly pulling my phone out, trying to make a visual excuse as to not to look so weird. Its very stupid, I definitely understand that. I didn’t know what else to do to keep any tear or anything from happening. The phone is right there and accessible, so i went for it, a lot. Its really weird because it felt like at some point its like that part of my psyche gave out or something, and all that instense anxiety kinda lifted for a brief moment, and i got kinda mentally numb to the surrounding stimuli and people. I was able to look up and in front of me where people were, and it felt SO fucking awesome. Ive never had that happen before. But then it came back down on me when going to check out. I just avoided looking at people at all. Its like if i try to focus on anything outside of whatever’s directly right in front of me, the anxiety increases a ton. 

I hate it, and i fucking hate that i can’t handle everyday normal shit like talking to people, or even something as simple as eye contact. It’s gotten so bad, and me trying to expose myself more to the scary stress, doesn’t seem to help much. 

Ive never really talked to anyone about it. Its this deep deep shame i have. Ive only vaguely mentioned to my friends that i have a bit of social anxiety, but thats it. I don’t really feel okay talking about it with my dad, because I don’t think he’d really believe me. I don’t really think he believes in stuff like that. And i’m not as close with my mom as id like to be, so that would be weird af. I just watch videos, try and read up on it, and read other reddit user’s experience with social anxiety. I watch a ton of HealthyGamerGG, and try to apply that way of internalization to myself, trying to pretty much self dissect my mental space from the inside out.

(Sorry this is a ton to read, its sort of a vent in a way. My bad lol.)

But yeah, I’ve always been single throughout my whole life. School was kinda rough, and especially high school, when i git interested in dating. Ive always had socializing issues, and use to have VERY bad self worth issues, especially as a young kid. Very well hidden issues, that i never dared share with any one soul at all lol. Sorta internalized a lot of that stuff, and got used to the feelings. I still don’t share my issues with my family at all, but I’ve slowly built up a little bit of a since of self worth and still trying. But yeah, I felt very lonely and awkward in school years, and was frustrated a lot, not knowing how to connect to people, and not feel weird or wrong for trying. 

That shit absolutely got worse after graduation. I never went to college, and instead went to work with my dad as a diesel mechanic, because i had zero clue what i want to do. I was really depressed for a very long while. A lot of questioning my intrinsic worth as a person, and what i could possibly have to offer to the people around me. Felt like such a blank slate of a person, with no real value. 

I think thats still kinda lingers in my mind a bit, even given the fact that I’m now trying to build a sense of self worth (a lot of which i found in valuing my ideals, and my thoughts on how i like to treat people). Just this weight in my mind, that i have to amount to something, and have to be able to have skills and intrinsic worth as a person to be of value/worthy of attention and affection. Its not quite enough in my mind to just be me, of that makes sense. 

I want a partner bad. I just have this looming thing that feels like i can’t control it when it happens. Any advice would be so amazing.",1,1762827687.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1otxht5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1otxht5/im_still_grieving/,I'm still grieving,"Hi, just a quick letter I hopefully get the courage to send you.

It's been four weeks since the funeral, but things are getting tense.

Charlie and Sally Ann have gone home.
The house feels empty but not empty if you know what I mean.

But what gets me going now is that some say, especially close friends like you, Marylou.

 Time will heal, even though it doesn't seem real.

I know you and they mean well but saying, seeing is believing, but how can you and others see, what I'm feeling? 

While I'm still grieving, while the black hearse of loving is always leaving, whenever I look at our old photographs?

Leaving all once treasured things behind like scattered Autumn leaves.
.
Things like sweet perfumed love letters from our first meeting at university.

My twin golden engraved wedding ring.
Perfume filled white sweaters.

Memories of Christmas and holidays.

Fun seaside days away with Charlie and Sally Ann and enjoying all things once kind and divine, which once made our souls sing.

So, Marylou, it's a cruel lie, saying time will heal what I'm feeling.

For I struggle to live through each day, alone, now, she's gone.

For inside, I'm quietly dying.
The smiles fake as I deal with this almighty heartbreak.

Listening to people say at church or over coffee at Starbucks, seeing is believing, time will bring healing.

And, knowing deep down inside, how can they see what I'm still feeling when I'm obviously still grieving?

Always seeing the black hearse of love, leaving, and quietly going out of my mind:

Like a victim of organized crime.

After my marriage to the hand, I'll always love has run out of earthly time, and is no longer in your realm.

Breathing.

I apologize for sending this, but my smiles wearing thin as I see and hear her everywhere I look or go.

Next time I see you at church, we'll go for a coffee and talk about her.

I'm sure she'll love it.
Your old army buddy, Ralph.

1otxhrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrCreepyPasta/comments/1otxhrg/the_blackened_shell_the_night_i_saw_bowsers_band/,“The Blackened Shell: The Night I Saw Bowser’s Band,"I don’t talk about this night often. Not because I’m scared—okay, maybe a little—but mostly because no one believes me. They think I’m trolling. But I swear on my limited edition Luigi’s Mansion GameCube: Bowser started a black metal band. And I saw them live.

It all started with a Craigslist ad. Yeah, I know. That’s already a red flag. But I was desperate. My doom metal band, Mushroom Doom, had just imploded after our bassist got radicalized by a Breath of the Wild speedrunning cult. I needed a new gig.

The ad read:

> “Seeking drummer. Must be able to blast beat at 300 BPM. Must not fear fire, spikes, or the void. No plumbers.”

I thought it was a joke. But the contact email was legit: koopa.king666@darknetmail.ru.

I replied with a link to my SoundCloud and a photo of me in corpse paint holding a double kick pedal like a battle axe. Ten minutes later, I got a reply:

> “You’re in. Rehearsal tonight. Bring earplugs. And a goat.”

I figured it was a gimmick band. Maybe a viral marketing stunt for a new Mario game. But I was bored and curious, so I packed my gear, grabbed a plush goat from my niece’s toy bin (close enough), and drove to the address.

It was an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese on the outskirts of town. The animatronics were still inside, but someone had spray-painted pentagrams over their eyes and replaced the ball pit with lava lamps and dry ice machines. The smell of burnt pizza and brimstone hit me like a Koopa shell to the face.

That’s when I saw him.

Bowser. In the flesh. Seven feet tall, spikes gleaming, wearing a leather vest with “BLOODSPINE” stitched across the back in crimson thread. His shell had been painted matte black with inverted crosses carved into it. He was holding a Flying V guitar the size of a surfboard.

“Yo,” he growled. “You the drummer?”

I nodded, too stunned to speak.

“Good. You’re late. Let’s melt some faces.”

The rest of the band was equally unhinged. On bass was Dry Bones, who played with his ribcage and occasionally detached his skull to scream backup vocals. On keys was Kamek, who summoned synth riffs from a cursed Moog that levitated and occasionally wept blood. And on rhythm guitar was a Chain Chomp in a studded collar, tethered to a mic stand and growling in 7/8 time.

We rehearsed for six hours straight. No breaks. No water. Just blast beats, guttural roars, and the occasional fireball. Bowser didn’t sing so much as roar lyrics in a language I’m pretty sure predates Latin. The songs had titles like “Throne of Molten Spines,” “Yoshi’s Final Breath,” and “Peachless Eternity.”

At one point, he turned to me and said, “Double kick harder. I want the floor to crack open and summon the Lakitus of the Abyss.”

I did. And I swear I saw something crawl out of the ball pit.

After rehearsal, Bowser handed me a contract written in what looked like Goomba blood. I signed it. I don’t remember why. Maybe it was the fumes. Maybe it was the music. Maybe it was the way he said, “We’re opening for Gorgoroth at the Underworld Coliseum.”

The gig was the next night.

I showed up in full corpse paint, only to be told that wasn’t “kvlt” enough. Kamek hexed me into a shadow version of myself. My skin turned grey, my eyes glowed red, and my drumsticks screamed every time I hit a cymbal. It was metal as hell.

The crowd was… not human. I saw Shy Guys in leather harnesses, Boos moshing through walls, and a Hammer Bro with a face tattoo of Mayhem’s Dead. Someone was selling bootleg shirts that said “BLOODSPINE: Koopa or Die.”

We opened with “Shellfire Baptism.” Bowser screamed into a mic made from a petrified Toad skull. The crowd went feral. I lost three cymbals and most of my hearing in the first song. Dry Bones exploded during the bridge and reassembled just in time for the breakdown.

Then came the finale: “Bowser’s Lament (Peach Rejected My Demo Tape).”

It was a 12-minute epic with a harp solo, a spoken word interlude in ancient Koopanese, and a wall of sound so intense it caused a dimensional rift. I saw glimpses of alternate timelines—one where Luigi was a warlock, one where Mario was a sentient fungus, one where Toad ran a black metal coffee shop called “Corpse Brew.”

When the last note hit, Bowser breathed fire into the crowd. Not metaphorically. Literally. Half the audience was incinerated. The other half cheered harder.

After the show, Bowser pulled me aside.

“You did good,” he said. “You’ve got the fury. The darkness. The tempo of torment.”

“Thanks,” I croaked, my throat raw from screaming backup vocals in Koopa Latin.

“But you’re too… alive.”

Before I could ask what he meant, Kamek hit me with a spell. Everything went black.

I woke up in my apartment. My drum kit was gone. My corpse paint was permanent. My cat won’t come near me. And every time I try to play music, my instruments whisper in tongues.

I tried to find the Chuck E. Cheese again. It’s not there. Just an empty lot with scorched earth and a faint smell of lava.

No one believes me. But sometimes, late at night, I hear blast beats echoing from the sewers. And if I listen closely, I can make out the lyrics:

> “No gods. No plumbers. Only pain.”

So yeah. Bowser started a black metal band. And I was their drummer. For one night.

And if you ever get an email from koopa.king666@darknetmail.ru… don’t open it.

Unless you’re ready to shred.

hubby comes in she talked to him first all upset and he jumps on me ur overdoing it fam sticks together blames my preg for making me nuts or not pulling weight - not pulling weight? im sick every am still working he golfs saturdays. worst tho she hates cats says allergy so she grabbed my rescue kitty 8 yrs old he got me thru bad depression after grandma and left him at shelter no word. hubby knew didnt say shit just like eh get a dog for baby later whatever.
