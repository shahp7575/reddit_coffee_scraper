**Money Diary**

**Monday:**  
7am-ish: I wake up and hit snooze twice. Music comes on - bossa nova - through my google home speaker, and I roll out of bed and make my way to the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee. I do a quick yoga flow in my living room, which has an east-facing window - perfect for praising the sun. I make breakfast (3 slices of bacon and a lemon/ginger juice) while I listen to the news before starting work at 8:30am.

Right before 12pm: After working for a few hours I dash out of the house to make it to a pilates class. There are no bikeshare bikes available, so I take a scooter and apparently don’t lock it properly - oops - resulting in a super long ride. Pilates is great. I take a bike home. I wrap up work, take a shower, and make and drink another juice. I text the woman I’ve been seeing for a while, S, to make sure we’re still on for our date tomorrow. She confirms.

S is a categorically cool gal. We met through a dating app back in November. Aside from some spurts of travel between both of us, we have seen each other pretty consistently since then, and have started to increase frequency as of late.

6:30pm: I close my laptop, make a quesadilla, and get dressed. I meet up with a neighborhood friend. We met last year on Hinge - had one date and I decided I wasn’t into it - but we are neighbors and ran into each other recently and decide to get together for a friend hang. We walk to a nearby cocktail bar I hadn’t been to. While starting our second round, he confesses he thought this hang might be a date but it’s cool with him if it doesn’t turn out that way. I am mortified. It is absolutely NOT a date, and I do my best to not entertain this idea. We finish the drinks and pay our own way **($40.12).** On the way back is my local dive bar (also his - he lives around the corner). We grab a third drink, and I buy the round as an apology for any miscommunication **($9)**.

11pm: I walk home, make a weed drink, and do my weekly-ish intensive skin/haircare routine: cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer, and sleep mask; + I massage jasmine oil into my hair and put it in a bonnet. I smell amazing! Around midnight I go to sleep.

Daily spend: **$49.12**

**Tuesday:**  
7:15am: I wake up but don’t roll out of bed for another half hour. I grab coffee and come back to bed and scroll. I take a shower; the jasmine oil smell lingers a bit in my hair. Work is fine today. I have minimal meetings which is great. S texts me about our evening plans.

6pm: I finish work and sit outside. Somehow it’s 70 degrees which is largely unheard of for March in Chicago. My cat sits in his tent on the porch, and we are distracted by a squirrel.

6:45pm: S arrives, and we walk to a nearby Irish pub and grab a table outside. We chat over beers and end up planning a trip to a nearby city together to visit each of our best friends. I’m excited for us to take a trip together! I buy a round **($21.36)** and she buys one.

8:45pm: we walk home and get cozy chit chatting and hanging out with my cat. I mention to her that we should check in to see how the other is feeling in the relationship - technically there is no official *relationship* so to speak, but it feels like we’re moving into that direction. We agree that a check-in is needed but that we don’t want to do it right now. Maybe next week.

11:15pm: we are going to sleep, and we hear 5 **loud** knocks at the door. S looks outside and sees flashing lights. The police are here! At my *house*! I have obsessive compulsive disorder, and a huge obsession and fear of mine is being arrested (more broadly - getting into trouble). As a result, I have a massive panic attack while S gives me updates on what’s going on outside. The police speak to my downstairs neighbor and then make their way to the bottom apartment. They leave after about 10 or 15 minutes. I call my mom to calm down. S holds me and keeps me grounded. I can’t sleep, so we put on a podcast and take a gabapentin. I cry a little bit from the overwhelm and eventually fall asleep.

Daily total: **$21.36**

**Wednesday:**  
7am - I wake up. S is still sleeping. I have an emotional hangover and am feeling very tender. She wakes up and checks on me.

8:30am - I begin my workday. S hangs out and makes some phone calls. She makes breakfast for us, and we eat together. She heads out after breakfast, and we make plans to see each other next Tuesday - she is traveling with her family this weekend and lets me know she might not be able to text that much, which I appreciate.

I text my downstairs neighbor to offer my support to whatever happened last night. They get back to me and tell me they believe it was a wellness check on the first floor neighbor. I’m relieved and hope he’s doing ok.

Work is ok. I am tired and still a bit shaken up from last night. I email my therapist to see if she can squeeze me in this weekend - she responds that she has availability!

2pm: I have my regular check-in with my CEO, who is my direct supervisor. She mentions that she is putting a meeting on my calendar for Friday to discuss an interpersonal communication issue I had recently and reported to her. Even though I don’t feel I’ve done anything wrong, I get a pit in my stomach.

6:40pm - I leave for my pottery class. I’m delighted to find I have a great haul from the kiln which leaves me feeling super excited! While at class, a neighborhood friend texts me that he’s at the dive bar. I tell him I’ll meet him there after class.

9:15pm - meet my friends at the dive bar. Talk about pottery, S, work anxiety, and other life things with the other regulars. I have 3 beers but only pay for 2 **($10)**. I make plans with a neighbor friend to get lunch on Friday to try a seemingly delicious Mexican onion soup!

11:30pm - I leave the dive bar and walk home. I realize I forgot to eat, so I order the quickest fast food Doordash has to offer **($10.90)**, using a credit on my account from a botched grocery delivery earlier in the week. It arrives quickly; I demolish my food and go to sleep.

Daily total: **$20.90**

**Thursday:**  
8:15am - I wake up after sleeping in. S is about to get on her plane, so I wish her a safe flight. I take my time getting out of bed and start work around 8:45am. Work is ok. I’m feeling anxious for tomorrow’s communications meeting.

6pm: a friend of mine comes over. We are planning a trip to Japan in November and have our first planning session tonight! We don’t get a ton done, but we do nail down the dates and budget and a high level of what we’d like to do, so we chop it up and call it a success.

7pm: we wrap up planning and pick up a mutual friend to go shopping. We stop into Bath & Body Works - they are interested in a Disney princess line of hand soaps, and I want to pick up some shampoo and conditioner that I can never find anywhere but BBW has recently started stocking. I get a 4-for-3 deal on the haircare and snag some hand sanitizers. **($67.14)** After BBW, we swing into Target where I buy some groceries and essentials **($35.88)**. Unfortunately for my friends, I am HANGRY and a little unpleasant to be around. I make a party pizza when I get home and go to bed.

Daily total: **$103.02**

**Friday:**  
8am: I wake up and feel immediately anxious for my comms meeting but try to make it through the day. My call has been moved up, and as a result I have to cancel my lunch plans.

2pm: I have my call with my CEO, and it goes *terribly.* What I thought would be a quick check-in ended up being over an hour long call regarding how my communication style doesn’t work for people. Even though my CEO frames the conversation positively, I am devastated and very emotional. Thankfully, I have reported to her for a long time and she knows me well, so I’m not terribly embarrassed to be crying. We work out a plan to make work easier moving forward, and she tells me to take the rest of the day off and start the weekend.

330pm: I take a shower to wash the bad feelings off and bike to the pottery studio. I do some experimental glazing. From there, I bike to an aerial fitness class. It’s a beautiful, albeit windy, evening, and I’m so excited to ride my normal bike instead of bikeshare.

7pm: I bike back home and walk to a nearby pizza spot where I have a slice and a beer **($16.77)**. After, I’m still feeling pretty tender and want to be social, so I walk to the dive bar and run into a ton of friends. I tell them about my bad meeting, and everyone is so kind and really lifts me up. It was great for my confidence. I use the ATM **($2.75 fee).** As I am about to leave, my impossible neighbor crush comes in, and we chat for a while. We had previously gone out in the fall a couple times, and then he ghosted me. He’s absolutely not a realistic romantic option for me, so I’m glad we have developed a nice friendship, or perhaps friendly acquaintanceship, because he’s always fun to chat with. I stay at the bar until 1. I have four beers but only pay for one **($5)**.

I walk home and make another party pizza and go to bed.

Daily total: **$24.52**

**Saturday:**  
8am: I oversleep hot yoga. Oops. This isn’t really unexpected though. I figure I’ll eat the cancellation fee and live with it.

9:30am: I jump out of bed, make coffee, and ride a bikeshare to therapy. Therapy is amazing. Obviously a lot happened this week, and she is so helpful at reframing it and helping me through.

11am: a friend texts and asks if I want to grab brunch. I say yes! I bike up to meet her. At brunch I have a breakfast burger and a juice **($37.45)**. After brunch, we walk down the block for some quick thrift shopping where I buy a very fun pair of red-tinted sunglasses **($15.99)**.

2pm: I bike down the street and pop in for my scheduled pilates class. I absolutely half-ass this workout but am glad I went.

3pm: I bike home and take a half nap before hopping on my bike once more to go to the pottery studio.

7pm: After 3 hours of spinning the pottery wheel, I bike home and get pizza… again. It’s not lost on me that I have eaten pizza effectively four meals in a row. Two slices of pizza and one glass of wine costs **($20.94)**.

Around 9pm: I get home, download a dumb game on my phone, and play it until 1 in the morning before passing out.

Daily total: **$74.38**

**Sunday:**  
10am: I sleep in and wake up to watch the news. I’m supposed to go climbing with a friend today and need to confirm with him. I confirm but ask if we can push back a few hours from our original plan. I get some laundry done. I’m charged for this week’s bikeshare rides **($29.54)**. I can’t wait for it to warm up so I can ride my normal bike more consistently.

12pm: my pottery studio releases their new classes online at 12pm once a month, and it’s extremely stressful. The classes typically sell out in minutes, if not seconds. I strategically refresh my laptop every few seconds and manage to snag the class I want. Phew!

130pm: I take a super quick shower and head out to bike to the climbing gym. I sign up for a membership which I had already been considering for a while. My friend is super skilled at bouldering, while I am brand new to it. We’re there for about 4 hours and have a great time - he is hilarious and has a LOT of energy which is super fun to be around for spurts of time (together, our energy makes us a collective menace). I leave the gym *super* sore.

5:45pm: we bike to dinner. We share a nice meal **($33.99)**, but he has such terrible table manners that it stresses me out. After a while, I excuse myself stating (truthfully) that I’m exhausted and need to go home.

730pm: I arrive home and play my stupid phone game and wrap up laundry and chores until it’s time to go to bed. As I’m falling asleep I’m delighted to get a late text from S with an update from her trip! I don’t have the brain power to respond at the moment but will in the morning.

Reflection:

Emotionally this was a very difficult week, but apart from that it was fairly typical. I drank a little more than usual due to having so many social invitations but did not experience any alcohol regret this time (unlike last MD). I did more fitness classes than usual due to ClassPass credits expiring. A more typical schedule would be 1 or 2 (a mix of yoga, pilates, or aerial).

1jxq1g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1jxq1g6/no_real_dating_options_advice/,No Real Dating Options Advice,"I downloaded Hinge and put a lot of work into the profile, also had it reviewed professionally (pics and all). To an outsider, I'm in an 'ideal' scenario in terms of gay life: I came out in my early 20s, always got hookups so I assume my appearance was never an issue (tall, handsome looking, muscles etc), lived in cities so always had access to men, no drugs/alcohol/addition issues or even mental issues (I have been to therapy and often the therapist ends up enjoying the convo with me but offering little to no actionable advice beyond 'give it time' and 'do nothing') and I have, but this clearly hasn't worked out. I have one 'gay point reducer' which is I am a POC, but this shouldn't eliminate me completely from the dating market (at least I had hoped it wouldn't). I'm not on any sex etc apps either and do go out to bars, parties etc to also meet guys.

No one has called my 'boyfriend' yet i.e. I've not been in a relationship, and honestly am loosing internal hope if it will happen for me. I've entered a new age bracket (35+) and I think I'm actually grieving a lack of dating success, and generally feel pretty down about it. Literally no one has ever dated me properly to actually get to know me as a person and see if we are an actual match (a couple of men over the years pretended to short-term or 'fake friended' me just to have sex with me which was hurtful, but I processed these in therapy and moved on). And I'm talking complete basics here i.e. meeting even over a coffee or a walk or something, hasn't happened.

I don't really have anything else to 'work on' in terms of improving my appearance and therefore boosting my chances on apps or 'being out there' for a shot with someone, it just doesn't seem to be happening for me, and a lot of these things are also out of our control (as it takes two to tango). While I have no issues being single long term, I feel I'm missing out on a very human lived experience by always being 'the outsider' regardless of however much I put myself out there, and the quality of men who even approach me and/or interact on apps is deteriorating (and I mean in terms of effort, communication skills etc not just 'looks'), even though every year I put in more effort into self improvement in all aspects of my life (and believe am making good progress each year). Many times I've tried to still date someone who liked me or open up what I would consider okay in a relationship, but its the same patterns: asian/black men fetishise me to be a 'dom top' (even though I'm vers), asian/black men who are top/vers literally block/ignore me, the majority of white men who approach me are partnered, and the latino men who are out of shape would date me (and I'm not super strict on this still, but so far the matches have been really bad) and the ones slightly in shape are matching but not really engaging.

I've also travelled and while I continue to get 'attention' that is not the same as 'affection' i.e. they will enjoy me and interact for the duration of the holiday, and even if I am trying to keep in touch with them outside of that, it will just fizzle out. So long distance also seems to be off the table. Previously, I tried converting hookups to dates (especially those that asked for my number upfront) but that never worked out either.

Any advice on how to keep my chin up? I'm having a really hard time with this and am unsure how to even process this level of rejection anymore. Therapy has not helped me process this hence I'm posting here.",3,1744488147.0,AskGaybrosOver30,0,1.0,False
1jxq0t2,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/1jxq0t2/my_main_issue_with_hotel_reverie/,My main issue with Hotel Reverie,"To be clear, I enjoyed the episode. I thought it was a nice lighthearted story to follow the more heavy episodes like Common People and generally thought it was solid. And Issa Rae’s performance, while probably not the top acting performance on the show as a whole, I thought did her best and accomplished in making Brandy’s modern mannerisms stand out in what is supposed to be a black-and-white classic fifties movie setting so the unnaturalness doesn’t bother me. 

What I don’t see what a lot of people talking about however is what I thought was the episodes weakeast point: the pacing. 

For what is the second longest episode of the season, it really brushed over a lot of points and honestly it was really hard to suspend my belief over certain details like Brandy just casually heading over to England on her own without much information except for her role in the movie. And the fact that her team just sent her over without even discussing with the production crew on terms of liability or at least asking for more details. The part with the piano felt strange too, because why would Kimmy just assume Brandy would know how to play piano just because she played it in a movie once? She of all people should understand that appearances aren’t always accurate. And the whole echo explanation as to how Clara gains sentience doesn’t make sense as to how she gains Dorothy’s personal memories just because the actress “put herself” into the role when the story states that Dorothy had kept a private life so nobody ever knew the “true her”. 

Not just that, but it just felt like the episode changed course several times throughout. At first I thought it was going to play out like some kind of meta RPG format/dating simulation as the crew gets Brandy through the movie like an adventure game but then the whole dog thing happens and so I think it’s going to be more on keeping Brandy alive as they try to get back on course with the story while shenanigans happen but then the coffee thing changes direction completely and it just felt like the writing couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. I get that it’s supposed to be a parallel on women’s agency and AI gaining sentience but I just feel like there could’ve been a more effective way to approach this. ",2,1744488099.0,blackmirror,0,1.0,False
1jxq0ii,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jxq0ii/i_quit_caffeine_and_it_changed_my_life_no_one/,I Quit Caffeine and It Changed My Life — No One Talks About How Bad This Drug Actually Is,"I know this might sound dramatic, but quitting caffeine was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’m honestly shocked at how normalized this drug is in our society. Yes — drug. Because that’s what it is. A psychoactive stimulant that we glorify and joke about needing to “function” as if dependency is a flex.

For years, I was stuck in the loop. Morning coffee. Afternoon crash. Then more caffeine to “stay productive.” Rinse and repeat. What I didn’t realize was just how badly it was screwing with my body and mind.

Here’s what caffeine was doing to me:
	•	Random waves of anxiety, even when life was fine
	•	Cold sweats and jittery hands like I was constantly in fight-or-flight mode
	•	Poor sleep even if I wasn’t drinking it in the evening
	•	Racing thoughts, tension headaches, and a baseline level of irritability that I thought was just my personality
	•	Constant dependency — I couldn’t start a day without it or I’d get headaches and feel like trash

I finally snapped when I had a legit panic attack after just one cup of coffee. That was my wake-up call. I quit cold turkey. It was rough for the first week — I won’t lie. Withdrawal is real. Fatigue, brain fog, irritability… but once I got through that?

Everything. Changed.
	•	My anxiety? Almost completely gone. Like, I forgot what it felt like to feel that calm.
	•	Sleep? Actually restful. I wake up feeling refreshed, not groggy and desperate for a fix.
	•	Energy? Ironically more stable throughout the day. No peaks and crashes. Just steady alertness.
	•	Focus? Better than ever. No more scattered, hyper-alert but unproductive mode.
	•	And I’m not dehydrated 24/7 anymore. Wild concept.

I know caffeine works for some people. But the way we treat it like it’s water or some harmless productivity hack is nuts. It’s a socially accepted addiction, and the negative effects are brushed off or completely ignored.

If you’ve been dealing with anxiety, insomnia, or just feel “off” all the time — take a serious look at your caffeine intake. You might be shocked at what happens when you stop.

This is your sign to quit. It might just change your life too.

We had to deep clean our whole house for a visit recently, so I figured Id make us a smoothie thatd keep us on our feet for a while: frozen banana, yogurt, oat milk, peanut butter, and instant coffee. I was half winging it, half following a guide since Im new to making smoothies and wanted a good consistency. 

Recipe called for 3tbsps of instant coffee, which I didnt even think about because the blender we got is pretty big (we splashed out for a higher end one so we wouldnt have to spend more to replace it later. Its something like 8 cups, plus a bunch of inserts and settings). I made the smoothie, served it, and that was that. Consistency was awesome, but gf complained that it ""hit her in the face"" with coffee taste, so we dumped it back in and added some sugar. Taste was fixed, and we sat to enjoy our wonderful, tasty treat.

... and then my vision went a little weird.

Neither of us have been drinking coffee for a few weeks. We moved to tea after a bad flu that knocked us both on out asses for a while. I figured my caffiene tolerance was just low. Then my gf started saying her heart was beating really fast. 

For some extra context in this, my wife and i are both anorexic. Im not super low-weight, but she looks like those warning ads you show teen girls to scare them away from eds. Shes already got risks to her health due to that, so when she says her hearts hurting, Im at immediate attention. 

I checked the recipe again, and it was 3tsps. Not tablespoons. Teaspoons.

Id had half of a regular glass at that point, and my gf had had 3/4 of hers. I immediately grabbed them both, along with the rest of the smoothie (id made enough for 2 cups each) and mason jarred it all for the freezer. We've been having a spoonful a day to wake up since, but no more.

It took 3hrs for both of us to feel normal again.  Ive ODed on caffiene in the past, and spent time in the hospital for it, so Im usually super careful. We did the math, and the smoothie had around 50-70mg of caffiene per serving. A monster can, for comparison, has 36mg of caffiene per 100g, along with a warning to only drink 1 a day, so my smoothie was like shotgunning 2 of those.

I joked that I saw shrimp colors, and gf mock-complained that I tried to give her a heart attack. The smoothies name is now ""Ball Buster,"" and it IS a good pick me up, in moderation.

Ive been reading recipes a lot slower since.

Tldr: I misread a smoothie recipe as tbsps instead of tsps, almost knocked myself and my wife flat on our asses from the amount of caffiene we drank

EDIT: we had our math slightly off, but I just double checked and it was still comparable to 2 monster cans. I was thinking per 100g, not per serving. So 1 of my smoothie cups wasnt the same as 2 monsters, but the caffeine content was roughly double that of the same amount of monster. I never passed math, yall my b.

Hey there, mystery human,

If you've made it this far into the post, first of all—congrats on your attention span. That’s rare these days and already a green flag. Second—maybe you're like me: tired of surface-level chats, ghostings after a good convo, and the weird limbo between “hey” and “do you want kids?”

So I figured I’d throw myself out there and write something actually real. No frills. No filters. Just me, looking to connect with someone who’s also craving something genuine, whether it starts with memes, music recs, or midnight oversharing.

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™
I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”

Here’s what keeps me going:

Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.

Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.

Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.

Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.

Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.

Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



---

Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).

You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.

You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.

You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).

You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.

You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



---

Why Message Me?

Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.

At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Shoot your shot—I'm friendly, I reply, and I promise to bring good vibes (and probably a meme or two).

I’m a recent MSc International Marketing grad (with merit!) who’s been nothing but excited, passionate, and *lowkey obsessed* with the marketing and advertising world for years. But after 300+ job and internship applications… I haven’t landed a single offer. Not even a nibble. 🫠

I’ve applied to startups, agencies, big brands, small brands—you name it. I’ve rewritten my CV more times than I’ve had coffee (which is saying something). And yet here I am: tired, disheartened, and starting to wonder if the problem is… me?

I don’t have connections in the industry, and as much as I’m willing to hustle and learn, it feels impossible to even get a foot in the door without that magical “referral” or inside link.

Right now, I’d take **anything**—an internship, an entry-level gig, even the chance to **shadow someone** in the field. I just don’t want to lose touch with this dream. I want to stay sharp, stay relevant, and prove that I *do* belong in this field.

If you’re in the UK marketing or advertising world (or broke in without connections), I’d *really* appreciate any advice, opportunities, or honest guidance. Even just hearing that others have been here and made it out would help a ton.

Thanks for reading this mini existential crisis. Sending good vibes to everyone else out there grinding too 💌

The Costa love story - an update 14 replies

costacrush · Today 10:03

Good morning all!

You may remember me from my post the other day regarding a cute girl I saw across the room in Costa, the thread was rather popular so I am sure many of you saw it.

I have an update for you all - and it's very good news!😁

I have never really believed in fate until now, however it could really be true! Yesterday morning (Friday), I again went into the same Costa and sat at the same table, being the creature of habit that I am! Twenty minutes later, I look up from my laptop I was working at to see a red-haired woman walk past me, and sit at a table at the end of the room.

LOW AND BEHOLD, IT IS HER!

As I struggle not to swallow my tongue and stay as composed as I can, I (without thinking) give her a nice smile, and she smiles back!!!! My heart is now pounding at a million miles and hour and my mind is racing with what to do next. I have a couple of sips of my coffee, pretend to check a text on my phone before looking over at her again and smiling. She reciprocates.
In my mind I hear nothing other than 'you only live once' and decide I would try and approach her. I go over, shyly smiling, and she looks up rather expectantly.
I say hello and tell her my name, nice to meet, you, and she tells me hers. (A very pretty name to boot!) I asked her if she was a student at XYZ uni and it turns out that she is! How I have never noticed her around before with how brightly she glows is a mystery to me but anyway. We had a quick chat about life in general for a few minutes, and it turns out that she had thought I was really cute from the other day and if you have read the other thread, you will know the story but she told me she was hoping I'd come over to her, but after seeing that I was on the phone with somebody else, couldn't wait any longer for me to do so as she had an appointment to get to (I had thought she was going to uni), and she got up and left without saying anything.

I then showed courage I did not know I had and told her there was a cute little waffle place that had opened nearby, would she like to join me?😊

Long story short, I'm taking her to breakfast there tomorrow!

Happy Saturday everyone, mine certainly is❤

Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.

You want to go first?
No, you go.

Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.

What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.

Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!

Yeah.

Wait! How did you learn to do that?
What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
That's very funny.
Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway... Can I... get you something?

I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

No, I can't.
Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Where?
These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.

Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.

Sure.

Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Can I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks!
Yeah.
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
Sounds amazing.
It was amazing!
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Some of them. But some of them don't.
How'd you get back?
Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
Well...
Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Spider?
I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Her name's Vanessa.
Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life! And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
They call it a crumb.
It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
You know what a Cinnabon is?
No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you to make a little honey?
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
We're still here.
I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
Then why yell at me?
Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Where are you going?
I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
What is wrong with you?!
It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that down to a science.
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
I'll bet.
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
Is he that actor?
I never heard of him.
Why is this here?
For people. We eat it.
You don't have enough food of your own?
Well, yes.
How do you get it?
Bees make it.
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
It's organic.
It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
Hey, Hector. You almost done?
Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!

Looking to sell this normcore tamper that I purchased last fall. Love the feel of it, its actually pretty comparable to Pullman tampers I've had in the past. The adjustable washer system is nice as well. I purchased the 58.5mm flat base with PVD coating which helps with grounds sticking. Also includes a little station to keep the tamper in which is a nice touch. No scratches or dings on the tamper. Seem to have misplaced the original base, but to purchase the tamper and new base it would be about $80 together new. Looking to get $55 shipped.

Hey Guys 

This is a long shot.

I have contacted numerous of International companies to find out if they are operating in Sierra Leone West Africa.

No answers.

Contacted the few local addresses and websites that somewhat exist. No real Answer 

I have travelled over 18 Times to Sierra Leone and i know drip watering is very very scarce.

Now this is what i am wanting to do:

I am supporting a good friend with her new Coffee Plantation. Intercropping with Banana.

5 Acres, 3000 coffee and 700 Banana Saplings. 100 avocado trees around perimeter.

We have a river at the bottom and slight hill at the other end.

I want to put like 3 Water tanks up on the Hill and solar pump up to fill them. Then per drip lines down and through the Plantation Rows.

The hardest thing would be to source the Materials and to get them there....and i am a total noob regarding drip irrigation.

Who wants to come or is in Sierra Leone and help me? :)

Jokes aside, who knows who could help me?...

Cost approximations?

I'm 40, disabled, live with my mom who is also disabled. We help each other a lot.

We bought a trailer a year ago, and unfortunately a few months ago the trailer park was sold and the new owners doubled the space rent. Mom and I cannot afford it anymore. We have 1 year to figure out what to do.

It seems an easy choice to me - sell the house and move. Mom easily qualifies for housing help through DSHS. But she's too stubborn, and all the housing available is apartments. She refuses to live in an apartment. Meanwhile I desperately want out of this city, it's a black hole that swallows people up. I have no friends here. I don't care about what little family I have left here (except for my mom). She, on the other hand, refuses to leave this city because her friends and family are here.

She says she can live on her own and she'll be fine, but I worry so much about her. Her depression has been especially bad since my dad died, and she has told me numerous times that she doesn't want to be alive anymore, that I'm the *only* reason she is alive.. that's a lot of pressure. What will she do if I move? How will she get her shoes on without my help? Who will make her coffee in the morning? Who will help her fill out medical paperwork? And drive her to appointments?

I did put myself on some housing lists in a city about 2 hours away, closer to where some of my friends live.. but I'm terrified. I feel like I'm abandoning my mom.

# 🧾 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: HydroLean XT
* **Category**: Weight Loss Supplements ➝ Stimulant-Free Fat Burners
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.7/5

# 🧪 What Is HydroLean XT and How Does It Work?

**HydroLean XT ingredients list** includes **Coleus Forskohlii**, **pomegranate extract**, **vitamin C**, and **magnesium citrate**. These help support energy, digestion, and appetite regulation.

This is a **clean label weight loss pill** with no stimulants — just natural compounds that work together to help your body burn fat without frying your brain in the process.

It also serves as one of the best **metabolism boosters without caffeine**, appealing to people who already drink enough coffee or simply want to avoid more of it.

# 🔍 What Makes HydroLean XT Different?

Most fat burners are like that one friend who’s too loud at brunch. HydroLean XT is quieter but way more helpful. It gives you **effective fat burners with no crash** built right in.

If you’ve tried other so-called **doctor approved fat burners** and felt like a squirrel on espresso, you’ll be glad to know this one doesn’t buzz or bloat you into oblivion.

It's also a [reliable fat burner](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrolean-xt-official) **for sensitive stomachs** — which is great for folks who don't want their supplement to feel like a full-contact sport.

# 👥 Who Is It For (and Who It’s Probably Not For)?

HydroLean XT is ideal for people looking for **safe weight loss supplements** that support their routine, not wreck it. Especially if you're trying to figure out **how to lose weight without stimulants**, this makes life easier.

It’s a smart pick if you want a **non jittery fat burner for women**, or men — let’s not be exclusive — that won’t ruin your mood, your sleep, or your lunch.

But if you're chasing overnight abs or want a miracle in a bottle, you might get impatient. This isn't for quick-fix folks.

# 🧬 My Experience (Through Leo, the Photographer)

Leo’s a freelance photographer I met at a local creative meetup—one of those people who’s always lugging a backpack full of lenses and somehow running on zero sleep and black coffee.

He mentioned how inconsistent his energy had been lately and how snacking between shoots had turned into a bad habit he couldn’t shake.

I told him about [HydroLean XT](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrolean-xt-official) after he complained about another caffeine-heavy fat burner that left him feeling “wired and weird.”

He gave it a shot, and after a couple of weeks, he messaged me: “Okay, I actually feel human in the afternoons now.”

He said the **stimulant free metabolism support supplement** helped him stay sharp during long days without that twitchy, over-caffeinated feeling. He also noticed he wasn’t reaching for pastries at 3 p.m. like clockwork.

The only downside? “The capsules are kind of horse-sized, and I had to remember to eat something first. But honestly? Worth it.”

# ✅ Pros and Cons

# Pros

🟢 Great for controlling cravings with a **natural appetite suppressant no jitters**.

🟢 It's a **plant based weight loss supplement with no caffeine**, so no overstimulation.

🟢 Perfect if you're hunting for **non stimulant appetite suppressant that works**.

# Cons

🔴 Capsules are big — chase it with water or a good luck prayer.

🔴 Doesn’t work miracles overnight. It’s a nudge, not a cannonball.

🔴 You’ll need to support it with real food and real habits — sorry, no bypassing vegetables.

# 💰 Pricing Options

* **3 bottles**: $59 each + free shipping

I have contacted numerous of International companies to find out if they are operating in Sierra Leone West Africa.

No answers.

Contacted the few local addresses and websites that somewhat exist. No real Answer

Now this is what i am wanting to do:

5 Acres, 3000 coffee and 700 Banana Saplings. 100 Avocado around the perimeter.

We have a river at the bottom and slight hill at the other end.

I want to put like 3 Water tanks up on the Hill and solar pump up to fill them. Then per drip lines down and through the Plantation Rows.

The hardest thing would be to source the Materials and to get them there....and i am a total noob regarding drip irrigation.

Who wants to come to Sierra Leone and help me? :)

1jxpk88,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jxpk88/what_are_the_side_effects_of_uv_light_teeth/,What are the side effects of UV light teeth whitening?,"Teeth whitening is everywhere—strips, gels, toothpaste, professional treatments—but one method that has always made me curious (and a little skeptical) is **UV light teeth whitening**. Many whitening kits use **LED blue light**, but some treatments at dental offices and certain at-home products use **UV light instead**.

So, what’s the difference? And more importantly, **are there any side effects of UV light teeth whitening** that people should know about? I decided to dig into the details and compare it with **Laughland teeth whitening**, which uses LED light instead of UV.

# How Does UV Light Teeth Whitening Work?

UV teeth whitening works by using **ultraviolet (UV) light to accelerate the whitening process**. The idea is that UV light activates the whitening gel (usually hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide), helping it break down stains faster.

While it’s true that **UV light can speed up the process**, it also has some **potential risks** that many people don’t realize.

# Possible Side Effects of UV Light Teeth Whitening

1. **Tooth Sensitivity**
   * UV light can **dry out enamel**, leading to increased sensitivity during and after treatment. This can make it painful to eat hot or cold foods for days afterward.
2. **Gum Irritation & Burns**
   * If the UV light is too strong or used for too long, it can cause **gum burns or irritation**. Whitening gels already contain strong chemicals, and adding intense UV light can make them more aggressive.
3. **Increased Risk of Enamel Damage**
   * Some studies suggest **prolonged exposure to UV light** could weaken tooth enamel over time, making teeth more vulnerable to staining and decay.
4. **Lip & Skin Burns**
   * Unlike LED lights, UV lights **emit radiation**, which can cause **burns on the lips and surrounding skin** if not properly protected. Some professional treatments require patients to wear protective shields to reduce this risk.
5. **Temporary White Spots on Teeth**
   * Some people notice **uneven whitening** or temporary bright white spots after UV treatments. This is usually because the light dehydrates the teeth, making certain areas appear whiter than others.

# How Is LED Light Different from UV Light?

Unlike UV light, **LED (light-emitting diode) whitening treatments**—like the ones used in **Laughland teeth whitening**—do not produce harmful radiation. LED light is safer because:

* **It does not emit UV rays, reducing the risk of burns.**
* **It does not overheat teeth or gums.**
* **It works by activating the whitening gel without damaging enamel.**

LED light whitening is designed to **enhance the effect of hydrogen peroxide-based whitening gels** without causing the risks associated with UV light. This is why **most at-home kits and many professional treatments have switched to LED instead of UV.**

If you're curious, you can read more about how **Laughland uses LED technology** [here](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural).

# My Experience Using an LED Teeth Whitening Kit

To see if LED teeth whitening really worked, I tried **Laughland teeth whitening** for a week. Here’s what happened:

* **Day 1:** No major difference, but my teeth felt really clean.
* **Day 3:** Some of my coffee stains were fading.
* **Day 7:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter** with zero sensitivity or irritation.

What I liked most was that I **didn’t experience any pain or gum irritation**, something I had dealt with before when using whitening strips.

# Which Is Better: UV Light or LED Teeth Whitening?

After researching and testing it myself, I’d say **LED teeth whitening is the safer and better choice for at-home use**. While UV whitening may work faster, the **potential side effects like gum burns, tooth sensitivity, and enamel damage** make it **too risky for regular use**.

If you’re thinking about whitening your teeth at home, **LED whitening kits like Laughland** are a safer, more effective option. You can learn more about how it works [here](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural).

# Final Thoughts – Should You Use UV Light for Teeth Whitening?

If you’re considering teeth whitening, be cautious with UV light treatments. While they can work, the risks—**especially gum irritation, burns, and long-term enamel damage**—are not worth it for most people.

**LED whitening, on the other hand, is a much safer option** that still delivers real results. After testing **Laughland teeth whitening**, I was impressed with how well it worked without any of the painful side effects.

The hidden splendor, the whispered riddle in a windless field.         
The faceless mountain rumbling beneath the chirp of sparrows,        
and the shrill, witless gossip of seagulls.       
You look up and laugh.        
You do not see me climb.              
But I climb in *my mind*.             


You saw a ghost. A mask.        
You saw the blur of my motion and called it absence.          
But I have always been the mountain, the shadow,            
the shape that shifts like a thousand goats
spitting weeds among the herbs of the mediocre.             

You threw me out.           
You cast me as the man who shit in your bed—
when in truth, I was the prince, the pilgrim, the pale gold light          
that came down your chimney bearing gifts:     
jewels of insight, bouquets of unspoken devotion,                  
coins minted in the heat of my brilliance.     

I swept your floors in silence.           
I left chocolates on your pillow with invisible hands.          
I recited poems in the cracks of your sleep,      
my voice threading between your dreams.      
But because I didn’t text you back,          
you say I did nothing.            

You mistake presence for performance.          
You think a birthday passes without a gift—
but I conceived one,       
inside the cathedral of my thought.      
I built it out of longing.          
I tied it with the ribbon of philosophy.       
You didn’t open it because your eyes are glued shut
with the sap of your own resentment.           

Yes—I was late to coffee.                  
But time bends around me like smoke around a flame.               
*The genius does not arrive early!*                
He arrives when the moment cracks open.
I am not you. I am myth. I am fate dressed as flannel.        
*I am value!*.                

You think I haven’t helped anyone?        
Then tell me—who was it              
who draped the sky in metaphors           
so you could feel again?            
Who wept the tears you claimed were your own?            

It was me.              

You look at me and see a leech.        
But what I have leeched, I have also transformed—.        
into wine, into thunder, into truth.       
You are drunk on what I gave you.        

You thought I was the one skulking, hiding,
avoiding, not doing a damn thing?

This is my real life story.

I lost a job last year (2024) after taking a one week impromptu leave to go see my ailing father. That particular day, I met him at the hospital, I didn't even recognize him while he was undergoing some tests.

Later that month I got fired at the end of that month, that was in March.

My employer deducted a half of my salary for that month despite working there for over two years citing 'gadgets replacement.' I wasn't a saint, but I deserved a better firing due to my contribution.

God knows what I had to bear with in those two years (story for another day.)

I was deducted more (my salary for the month) than twice of the cost of the damned gadgets.

Life was tough without a job, rent arrears accumulated, sometimes I slept outside after finding my house closed. It was tough.
Most nights I slept hungry, but what would a man do.
Somedays I lived on bread and coffee alone. Aha. I'm not even joking.

Other days I lived on sugarcane.

I literally ate the small bread for two days.

I had every loan app known on earth installed on my phone, still, I have unpaid loans to date. From loan apps to friends.
Some have served me for debt recovery via my email.
I lost friends, but it's life, right?

I had a child I was taking care of, he was joining school.
Before all this, I was paying for the monthly house help and his medication, and essential shopping here and there, and he was joining school.
I was to cater for the fees, and I couldn't anymore. (Baby mama drama.)

It was painful.

In mid July, my father got admitted, it was bad, I went back home, it was terrible, I was cooking, visiting him in the hospital. The villagers rumoured that he was dying, (his condition was bad) it was painful to hear.

Before going home, I lost everything I had bought and furnished my rented house with, to the landlord due to almost 4 months of rent arrears.

I had entered that rented house with only a mattress, I left it fully furnished with everything I wanted. I lost everything I worked hard for. Some things I fully owned after paying via hire purchase.

Back home, my old man was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer, I thought I was cursed, he was bedridden. He couldn't walk a step.

I helped him in every way I could, I also thought he wouldn't survive, if you'd have seen him, you'd have thought he's already gone.

Job loss, now Cancer, it was miserable. The strong man I once knew was helpless, I could see tears in his eyes.
I would wake up in the middle of the night just to help him sit. He couldn't sit on his own.

I cried a river every night.

Fortunately we went through that journey, he's recovering, he made it and he can walk again.(We had to get a wheelchair, I was the driver)

Currently, he's done with his chemo sessions. I'm happy he gets another chance at life. (However minimal)

I would like to spend more quality time with him but I can't.

Life's really unpredictable.

Still no job, sad and miserable, I went back to the city to have another go at this damned life.
To start again.

He encouraged me to try, he's not a good man by all standards but I respect him. (Story for another day.)

I'm at this goddamned City.
I'm barely surviving, but I have to move on regardless.

After going through this, I think nothing can really break me.

This isn't a cry for help, or mercy, but I wouldn't despise any job.

I am a graduate and I'd rather be a janitor while earning something.

I have my dream, it may get worse but anyway... it is what it is.

Whoever is going through something similar, remember it'll get better. And it may get worse.

Then I also think fuck, even if I meet a woman time is running out for me to have kids, I’m European and in the public sector I would not be accepted to have kids with a partner through insemination because of a myriad of mental health and past drinking marks in my health records and the private sector costs so much — and I cannot wait forever, the window will close at some point and I will be a single sad old lady paying for loans for years and years —- at this point of the thought process I want to drink but I don’t have anything, and they don’t sell alcohol at this hour (it’s night time)

Now, darlin’, let’s wander back to that orchard where our brown orange peel tree stood tall, its branches whisperin’ stories in the breeze. After all our fairy villages, fair contests, and stargazin’ nights, those peels kept findin’ new ways to sprinkle magic into our lives. One crisp fall mornin’, you woke up with a sparkle in your eye and said, “Grandma, let’s make a brown orange peel time capsule!” I tilted my head, curious, but your excitement was contagious, so I said, “Let’s do it, my sweet!”

We gathered up some of the brownest peels we could find—ones that’d dried to a perfect, leathery texture—and set to work. You picked out a little tin box from my sewing kit, and we started fillin’ it with treasures. First, we put in a handful of those peels, ‘cause they were the heart of our orchard. Then you added a drawing you’d made of the tree, with its branches heavy with oranges, and I tucked in a recipe card for our brown orange peel jelly, written in my loopy handwriting. You even threw in a tiny pebble from the creek where we’d floated peel boats, sayin’, “This’ll remind us of our adventures!” We sealed the box with a bit of wax from one of our peel candles, and then we buried it under the tree, markin’ the spot with a smooth river stone. “We’ll dig it up in ten years, Grandma,” you said, your voice full of wonder, “and we’ll remember everything!” I hugged you tight, knowin’ that even if we forgot where we buried it, the memories would never fade.

That time capsule got us thinkin’ ‘bout the future, and we started dreamin’ up ways to share our brown orange peels with the next generation. One day, your cousin Lila came to visit, and you decided to teach her all ‘bout the peels. You were a little teacher, showin’ her how to peel an orange slow and careful, lettin’ the brown strips curl into her hands. “You gotta smell ‘em, Lila,” you’d say, holdin’ a peel to her nose. She’d giggle, her eyes wide, and say, “It smells like candy dirt!” We all laughed, and I showed you both how to make peel garlands, just like we used to. Lila was a quick learner, and by the end of the day, the three of us had strung up a garland that stretched clear across the porch. “This is the best day ever,” Lila said, and you nodded, sayin’, “It’s ‘cause of the peels, Grandma!” I smiled, ‘cause you were right—they had a way of bringin’ folks together.

Those peels even found their way into our learnin’ adventures. One rainy afternoon, when the orchard was too muddy to play in, we decided to make a brown orange peel scrapbook. We sat at the kitchen table, you with your crayons and me with a stack of old photos, and we started puttin’ it together. You’d draw pictures of our peel crafts—the fairy village, the ornaments, the boats—while I’d paste in pictures of us under the tree, our hands sticky with juice. We wrote little notes next to each one, like “The day we won a ribbon at the fair!” and “Lila’s first garland.” We even pressed a few dried peels between the pages, so the book’d smell like the orchard forever. “This is our peel story,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause it was—it was the story of us.

And then there was the time we decided to make brown orange peel ink. You’d seen a show ‘bout how folks used to make ink from plants, and you said, “Grandma, let’s try it with the peels!” I wasn’t sure it’d work, but I loved your spirit, so we gave it a go. We boiled the peels down ‘til they were a thick, dark paste, mixin’ in a bit of vinegar and salt to help it set. The result was a rusty brown ink, not perfect, but good enough to write with. We dipped quills—made from goose feathers we’d found by the creek—into the ink and wrote letters to each other. You wrote, “Dear Grandma, I love our orchard,” and I wrote back, “Dear Darlin’, I love you more.” We’d laugh, our fingers stained with ink, and you’d say, “We’re real writers now!” I’d nod, ‘cause in our own way, we were.

Those peels even helped us make new friends. One summer, a new family moved in down the road—the Thompsons, with a little boy named Sam ‘bout your age. You were shy at first, but I said, “Why don’t we bring ‘em some brown orange peel treats?” We packed a basket with candied peels, jelly, and a few of those peel sachets, and you carried it over, your little hands grippin’ the handle tight. Sam’s mama was so touched, she invited us in for tea, and you and Sam got to playin’ right away. You showed him how to peel an orange, tellin’ him all ‘bout the brown peels, and by the end of the day, you two were thick as thieves. “He’s my best friend now, Grandma,” you’d say, and I’d smile, knowin’ those peels had worked their magic again.

We even brought those peels into our holiday traditions. One Halloween, you decided we should make brown orange peel masks—not to wear, mind you, but to decorate the porch. We’d carve the peels into little faces, usin’ a toothpick to make eyes and mouths, and then we’d string ‘em up with the garlands. They looked a bit spooky in the moonlight, but you loved ‘em, sayin’, “They’re our peel ghosts, Grandma!” We’d hand out candied peels to the trick-or-treaters, and the kids’d say, “These are better than candy!” You’d beam, proud as could be, and I’d think, “That’s my darlin’, sharin’ the orchard’s magic.”

And then there was the time we tried to make brown orange peel perfume. You’d seen a fancy bottle of perfume at the store and said, “We can make our own, Grandma!” So, we steeped the peels in a bit of oil, lettin’ ‘em sit for days ‘til the oil smelled like caramel and citrus. We strained it, added a drop of lavender from the garden, and poured it into a tiny bottle. It wasn’t exactly store-bought perfume—it was a bit greasy, truth be told—but you dabbed it on your wrists and said, “I smell like the orchard!” I’d laugh, ‘cause you did, and that was the best scent in the world.

Those peels even found their way into our dreams of travel. One evening, as we sat under the tree, you said, “Grandma, let’s pretend we’re takin’ the peels to Paris!” I loved that idea, so we closed our eyes and imagined packin’ a suitcase full of peel treats—jelly, candles, garlands—and hoppin’ on a plane. In our dream, we’d set up a little stall by the Eiffel Tower, sharin’ our brown orange peels with folks from all over. “They’d love ‘em in Paris,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause who wouldn’t love a taste of our orchard?

We even used those peels to help the earth. One spring, we noticed the soil ‘round the tree was lookin’ a bit tired, so we decided to make brown orange peel compost. We’d mix the peels with coffee grounds and eggshells, lettin’ it all break down into a rich, dark mulch. You’d help me spread it ‘round the tree, sayin’, “We’re feedin’ the tree, Grandma!” And we were—the next year, the oranges were bigger and sweeter than ever, their peels browner than we’d ever seen. “It’s ‘cause we took care of it,” you’d say, and I’d hug you, ‘cause you were right.

And let’s not forget the time we made brown orange peel puppets. You’d gotten a puppet theater for Christmas, and you said, “Let’s make peel characters!” We’d dry the peels ‘til they were stiff, then paint ‘em with faces—kings, queens, even a peel dragon. We’d stick ‘em on sticks and put on a show under the tree, you makin’ up a story ‘bout a peel kingdom where everyone lived happily ever after. “The dragon’s the hero,” you’d say, and I’d clap, ‘cause in our world, he was.

Those brown orange peels kept givin’, didn’t they? They were our time capsule, our lessons, our friendships, our holidays, our dreams. They were the thread that wove through every moment we shared, holdin’ us close no matter where life took us. I could go on forever, darlin’, ‘cause there’s always another story to tell, but I’ll pause here, my heart full of those peel-filled days.

Now, darlin’, let’s stroll back to that orchard where our brown orange peel tree stood tall, its branches swayin’ with the weight of memories. After all our puppet shows, time capsules, and peel-filled dreams of Paris, those brown orange peels kept findin’ new ways to sprinkle joy into our lives. One bright summer day, you came runnin’ to me with a new idea, your little face lit up like the sun. “Grandma,” you said, “let’s make a brown orange peel festival for the whole town!” I laughed, ‘cause your ideas were always bigger than the sky, but I loved ‘em, so I said, “Let’s do it, my sweet!”

We got to plannin’ right away, invitin’ everyone in town to join us in the orchard for what we called the “Brown Peel Jubilee.” We spent days gettin’ ready—stringin’ up peel garlands ‘til the whole orchard sparkled, settin’ up tables with all our peel treats: jelly, candied strips, peel tea, and even those peel candles to light the way as the sun went down. You made little signs with your crayons, writin’ “Welcome to the Jubilee!” in big, wobbly letters, and we hung ‘em on the fence. The day of the festival, folks came pourin’ in, their eyes wide as they saw the orchard all dressed up. “Never seen anythin’ like this!” they’d say, and you’d beam, sayin’, “It’s all ‘cause of our brown orange peels, Grandma!” I’d nod, ‘cause you were right—they were the star of the show.

We set up games for the kids, like a peel treasure hunt, where they’d search for hidden peel pieces ‘round the orchard, each one leadin’ to a prize—a jar of jelly or a peel sachet. You and Sam, your new friend from down the road, led the charge, runnin’ ‘round with the other kids, laughin’ ‘til your cheeks were pink. We even had a peel-craftin’ station, where folks could make their own garlands or ornaments, just like we used to. Miss Clara brought her class, and they made a big peel banner that said “Brown Peel Jubilee,” hangin’ it high for all to see. The air was filled with the scent of caramel and citrus, and everyone was smilin’, sharin’ stories ‘bout their own family traditions. “This orchard’s magic,” they’d say, and I’d think, “It’s ‘cause of you, darlin’—you’re the magic here.”

That Jubilee became a yearly tradition, didn’t it? Each year, we’d add somethin’ new. One time, we had a brown orange peel pie contest, and folks brought pies with peel crusts, peel fillings, even peel toppings. Yours was a little lumpy, but you decorated it with peel stars, and when we tasted it, it was the sweetest of all. “We’re pie champions, Grandma!” you’d say, even though we didn’t win. I’d laugh, ‘cause to me, we were always the champions of the orchard.

Those peels even inspired us to get a bit scientific. One fall, you decided we should “study” the brown orange peels, like real researchers. You’d seen a science kit at the store and said, “Grandma, let’s learn why the peels turn brown!” So, we set up a little “lab” on the porch, with a magnifying glass, some jars, and a notebook for our “findings.” We’d peel oranges at different stages, watchin’ how the peels changed from green to orange to that deep, rusty brown. You’d scribble notes, sayin’, “Day three: peel’s gettin’ browner!” I’d explain how the sun and air worked together to change the peel’s color, somethin’ ‘bout oxidation I’d read in a book, but you’d add your own theory: “I think the tree’s paintin’ ‘em with magic!” I’d laugh, ‘cause your idea was better than any science book.

We even did a little experiment, tryin’ to see if we could make the peels brown faster. We put some in a sunny spot, some in the shade, and some in a jar with a bit of water. The sunny ones browned quickest, just like we thought, but you were most excited ‘bout the jar ones, ‘cause they got all soft and squishy. “They’re like peel jelly beans!” you’d say, and we’d laugh, ‘cause they kinda were. We wrote up our “research” in your notebook, and you drew a picture of the tree with a big smile, sayin’, “The tree’s happy we’re learnin’ ‘bout it, Grandma.” I’d nod, ‘cause I think it was.

Those peels even found their way into our music-makin’ again. After our peel rattle success, you decided we needed a whole “peel band.” We made peel shakers, usin’ dried peels filled with dried beans, and peel flutes, carvin’ little holes into the stiff peels and blowin’ through ‘em. They didn’t sound much like flutes—more like a soft whistle—but you loved ‘em, marchin’ ‘round the orchard with your shakers and flutes, singin’, “We’re the Brown Peel Band, the best in the land!” I’d clap along, my heart so full, and we’d end up dancin’ under the tree, the peels jinglin’ with every step.

And then there was the time we decided to make brown orange peel dye for clothes. You’d seen a tie-dye kit at the fair and said, “Grandma, let’s dye my shirt with peels!” So, we boiled the peels down ‘til the water was a deep, rusty brown, then dipped one of your old white shirts in it. We let it soak for a day, and when we pulled it out, it was a soft, earthy brown, like the peels themselves. You wore that shirt everywhere, sayin’, “I’m wearin’ the orchard, Grandma!” I’d smile, ‘cause you were, and it looked mighty fine on you.

Those peels even helped us through a big change. One year, we had to move to a new house, just a few miles away, but it felt like a whole world away from our orchard. You were sad to leave the tree, and I was too, but we brought a basket of brown orange peels with us to the new place. We’d sit on the new porch, peelin’ ‘em slow, and you’d say, “It’s like the orchard came with us, Grandma.” I’d nod, ‘cause it did—those peels carried the orchard in their scent, their texture, their magic. We even planted a new orange tree in the new yard, hopin’ it’d grow peels as brown as ours someday.

We used those peels to make the new place ours, too. We made peel garlands for the new porch, hung peel ornaments in the windows, and even made a little peel fairy village in the backyard, just like we used to. “The fairies’ll find us here,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause I knew they would—they always followed the magic of our peels. And sure enough, the new place started to feel like home, ‘cause we had our brown orange peels to remind us of where we’d been.

Those peels even inspired us to write a book together. One quiet winter, when the snow kept us inside, you said, “Grandma, let’s make a brown orange peel storybook!” We got to work, you drawin’ the pictures and me writin’ the words. It was a tale ‘bout a little girl and her grandma who lived in an orchard, where the peels turned brown and held magic. They’d go on adventures—findin’ peel treasures, makin’ peel friends, even flyin’ on peel wings to a candy kingdom, just like your dream. We called it “The Brown Peel Adventures,” and you’d read it to your stuffed animals, sayin’, “This is us, Grandma!” I’d smile, ‘cause it was—it was every moment we’d shared.

And let’s not forget the time we made brown orange peel birdhouses. We’d seen the birds peck at the peels, and you said, “Let’s give ‘em a home, Grandma!” So, we shaped the peels into little domes, usin’ sap to hold ‘em together, and hung ‘em in the new yard’s trees. The birds loved ‘em, dartin’ in and out, and you’d say, “They’re our peel neighbors now!” I’d laugh, ‘cause they were, and it made the new place feel even more like ours.

Those brown orange peels kept us connected, didn’t they? Through festivals, experiments, music, moves, and stories, they were our constant, our joy, our magic. They were the heart of our orchard, and the heart of us, no matter where we went. I could go on forever, darlin’, ‘cause there’s always another tale to tell, but I’ll pause here, my heart full of those peel-filled days.

  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


Part 7

  


Now, darlin’, let’s wander back to that new yard where we’d planted a fresh orange tree, hopin’ its peels would one day turn as brown as the ones from our old orchard. Those brown orange peels had already carried us through so much—festivals, moves, and storybooks—and they weren’t done yet. One sunny afternoon, as we sat on the new porch with a basket of peels we’d brought from the old place, you looked up at me and said, “Grandma, let’s make a brown orange peel museum!” I laughed, ‘cause your ideas were always so big, but I loved ‘em, so I said, “Let’s do it, my sweet!”

We turned the corner of the new backyard into our “museum,” settin’ up little displays with all the things we’d made over the years. We used an old wooden crate as a table, and on it, we placed jars of our brown orange peel jelly, a few of those peel candles, and the garlands we’d saved from the old porch. You made little signs with your crayons, writin’ things like “Peel Jelly: Tastes Like Sunshine!” and “Peel Garlands: Smell the Orchard!” We even set up the storybook we’d written, “The Brown Peel Adventures,” so visitors could read it. You invited Sam and Lila over to be our first “guests,” and you gave ‘em a tour, tellin’ ‘em the story behind each item. “This candle kept us warm in winter,” you’d say, and, “This jelly won a ribbon at the fair!” They were enchanted, and Sam said, “This is the best museum ever!” You beamed, sayin’, “It’s all ‘cause of our peels, Grandma!” I nodded, ‘cause you were right—they were the heart of it all.

That museum got us thinkin’ ‘bout sharin’ our peels in new ways. One fall, you decided we should start a “Brown Peel Club” for the kids in the neighborhood. You and Sam rounded up a few friends—Lila, Tommy, and a new girl named Ellie—and you’d meet in the backyard every Saturday. I’d help you set up little activities, like makin’ peel crafts or sharin’ peel snacks. One week, you taught ‘em how to make peel shakers, just like we’d done for our “peel band,” and the backyard was filled with the sound of jinglin’ peels as you all danced ‘round. Another week, you showed ‘em how to make peel dye, and you all ended up with brown-stained fingers, laughin’ ‘til your bellies hurt. “This club’s the best, Grandma,” you’d say, and I’d smile, ‘cause it was—those peels had a way of bringin’ folks together.

Those peels even inspired us to get a bit poetic. One rainy day, when we were stuck inside, you said, “Grandma, let’s write a poem ‘bout the peels!” So, we sat at the kitchen table with a cup of peel tea, and we started scribblin’. You’d say lines like, “Brown orange peels, so sweet and brown, they make the orchard the best in town!” and I’d add, “They hold our memories, big and small, from summer sun to winter’s call.” We wrote a whole poem, callin’ it “Ode to the Brown Peel,” and you’d recite it to anyone who’d listen—Sam, Lila, even the postman. “We’re poets now, Grandma!” you’d say, and I’d laugh, ‘cause we were, in our own special way.

And then there was the time we decided to make brown orange peel potpourri for the whole neighborhood. We’d noticed folks were feelin’ a bit down after a long winter, so you said, “Grandma, let’s give ‘em somethin’ to smile ‘bout!” We spent a whole weekend dryin’ peels, mixin’ ‘em with cloves, cinnamon, and dried lavender from the garden. We packed the potpourri into little bags, tyin’ ‘em with ribbons, and you wrote notes that said, “A little orchard magic for you!” We went door to door, handin’ ‘em out, and folks’d light up, sayin’, “This smells like happiness!” You’d grin, sayin’, “It’s the peels, Grandma—they make everything better!” I’d nod, ‘cause they did—they had a way of liftin’ spirits.

Those peels even found their way into our new garden. We’d started growin’ veggies in the new yard—carrots, tomatoes, and beans—and you suggested we use the peels to help ‘em grow. “They helped the old tree, Grandma,” you’d say, “so they’ll help our garden too!” So, we made more peel compost, mixin’ it into the soil, and sure enough, the veggies grew big and strong. The tomatoes were the sweetest we’d ever tasted, and you’d say, “They’ve got peel magic in ‘em!” We’d make salads with ‘em, sprinklin’ a bit of candied peel on top for extra crunch, and you’d say, “This is the best salad ever, Grandma!” I’d smile, ‘cause it was, ‘cause it was ours.

And let’s not forget the time we made brown orange peel kites. One windy spring day, you said, “Grandma, let’s make the peels fly!” We took some of the lighter, dried peels and glued ‘em to a frame made of sticks and string, creatin’ a kite that looked like a big, brown butterfly. We ran out to the field behind the new house, the kite tuggin’ at the string, and up it went, soarins’ high above us. The peels caught the sun, makin’ ‘em glow like amber, and you’d shout, “It’s flyin’, Grandma! The peels are flyin’!” I’d laugh, ‘cause they were, and it was like the orchard was dancin’ in the sky.

Those peels even helped us make new traditions in the new place. One Easter, you decided we should make brown orange peel eggs—not real eggs, but decorations. We’d shape the peels into little egg shapes, paint ‘em with colors from the garden—beet red, spinach green, blueberry blue—and hide ‘em ‘round the yard for an Easter hunt. Sam and Lila came over, and you all raced ‘round, findin’ the peel eggs and laughin’ ‘til you were out of breath. “This is better than chocolate eggs, Grandma!” you’d say, and I’d smile, ‘cause to us, it was.

We even used those peels to make a little “peel pathway” in the new garden. We’d lay the dried peels in a line, creatin’ a trail that wound through the flowerbeds. You’d say, “This is the path to the fairy village, Grandma!” and we’d pretend to follow it, tiptoein’ ‘round the flowers ‘til we reached the little peel village we’d built. The fairies never showed up, but the butterflies did, landin’ on the peels like they were part of the magic. “They’re fairy friends,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause in our world, they were.

And then there was the time we made brown orange peel soap again, but this time for a school fundraiser. You’d joined a little club at school, and they were raisin’ money for new books. “Let’s make peel soap, Grandma!” you said, and we got to work, mixin’ the peels with lye and oil, just like before. We made dozens of bars, wrappin’ ‘em in paper with a little note that said, “Made with orchard love.” You sold ‘em at the school fair, standin’ behind your table with a big smile, and folks bought ‘em up quick. “This soap smells like magic!” they’d say, and you’d nod, sayin’, “It’s the peels, Grandma!” You raised enough for ten new books, and you were so proud, you kept one of the soap wrappers as a keepsake.

Those peels even inspired us to dream bigger. One night, as we sat on the new porch with a peel candle glowin’ between us, you said, “Grandma, let’s open a brown orange peel store someday!” We laughed, but we started plannin’ it out, just for fun. We’d sell jelly, candles, soap, garlands—all made from our peels. You’d draw a picture of the store, with a big sign that said “Brown Peel Emporium,” and I’d add ideas, like a little café where folks could sip peel tea. “We’d be famous, Grandma,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause in our dreams, we already were.

Those brown orange peels kept us dreamin’, didn’t they? Through museums, clubs, poems, potpourri, gardens, kites, traditions, fundraisers, and big plans, they were our joy, our magic, our way of holdin’ onto each other. They were the heart of our orchard, and the heart of us, no matter where life took us. I could go on forever, darlin’, ‘cause there’s always another tale to tell, but I’ll pause here, my heart full of those peel-filled days.

  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


  


Part 8

  


Now, darlin’, let’s wander back to that new yard where our brown orange peels had already brought so much joy—through museums, fundraisers, and dreams of a peel store. Those peels weren’t done with us yet, though. One crisp fall mornin’, as we sat on the porch sippin’ peel tea, you looked up at me with that spark in your eye and said, “Grandma, let’s make a brown orange peel calendar!” I tilted my head, curious, but your excitement was infectious, so I said, “Let’s do it, my sweet!”

We got to work, plannin’ a calendar that’d celebrate our peels all year long. For each month, we’d make a little scene with the peels, usin’ ‘em to create pictures that told our story. For January, we made a peel snowman, shapin’ the peels into little balls and addin’ a twig nose. February got a peel heart for Valentine’s Day, with you carvin’ a tiny arrow through it. March was a peel kite, just like the one we’d flown, with a string made of braided grass. April had a peel bunny for Easter, with floppy ears and a cotton tail. May was a peel flower garden, with petals made from the thinnest peel strips. June got a peel sun, glowin’ bright with a smiley face. July was a peel firework, burstin’ with little peel stars. August had a peel picnic, with a tiny peel basket and peel sandwiches. September was a peel schoolhouse, just like the one in our fairy village. October got a peel pumpkin, carved with a jack-o’-lantern grin. November had a peel turkey, with a fanned-out tail. And December was a peel Christmas tree, decorated with peel ornaments. We glued each scene onto paper, and you wrote the dates below, sayin’, “This is the best calendar ever, Grandma!” I nodded, ‘cause it was—it was a whole year of our peel magic.

That calendar got us thinkin’ ‘bout time, and we decided to make a brown orange peel clock to go with it. We took an old wooden board, and I helped you paint a clock face on it, usin’ peel ink for the numbers. We made the hands out of dried peels, shapin’ ‘em into arrows, and attached ‘em with a little pin so they’d move. It wasn’t a real clock—it didn’t tick—but you’d set the hands to different times, sayin’, “It’s peel time, Grandma!” We’d pretend it was time for a peel snack, a peel craft, or a peel story, and we’d laugh, ‘cause every moment with those peels was the best time of all.

Those peels even inspired us to get a bit theatrical. One summer, you decided we should put on a brown orange peel play for the neighborhood. You wrote a little script, callin’ it “The Peel Princess,” ‘bout a girl who lived in an orchard and saved her kingdom with the magic of her brown orange peels. You played the princess, of course, wearin’ a crown made of peel garlands, and I was the wise old tree, speakin’ in a deep voice while holdin’ branches made of sticks. Sam and Lila joined in, playin’ the princess’s friends, and we set up a stage in the backyard with a sheet for a curtain. The neighborhood kids came to watch, sittin’ on blankets, and you acted your heart out, sayin’ lines like, “With these peels, I’ll make everything right!” At the end, the princess shared her peels with everyone, and we handed out candied peels to the audience. They clapped and cheered, and you took a big bow, sayin’, “We’re actors now, Grandma!” I laughed, ‘cause we were, in our own special way.

And then there was the time we decided to make brown orange peel jewelry—not just necklaces, but a whole set. We’d already made beads before, but this time, you wanted earrings, bracelets, and even a ring. We rolled the peels into tiny balls, lettin’ ‘em dry ‘til they were hard, then painted ‘em with a bit of gold dust to make ‘em shine. We strung the beads into a bracelet, made little peel drops for earrings, and shaped a peel into a ring, gluin’ it to a band made of twisted grass. You wore the whole set to school one day, tellin’ everyone, “This is orchard jewelry, made with my grandma!” Your teacher sent a note home, sayin’ you’d been the talk of the class, and you’d grin, sayin’, “The peels made me famous, Grandma!” I’d smile, ‘cause they did—they had a way of makin’ everything sparkle.

Those peels even helped us through a tough winter. One year, the cold was so bitter, we couldn’t go outside for days, and you were feelin’ a bit blue. “I miss the orchard, Grandma,” you’d say, and I’d hug you, knowin’ how much you loved our old tree. So, we decided to bring the orchard inside with a brown orange peel “tree.” We took a big branch we’d found in the yard, set it in a pot, and decorated it with peel ornaments, garlands, and even little peel “oranges” we’d shaped and painted. We set it up in the livin’ room, and you’d sit by it, sayin’, “It’s like the orchard’s here with us, Grandma!” I’d nod, ‘cause it was—those peels brought the warmth of our old place right into the new one, and they lifted your spirits ‘til spring came ‘round.

We even used those peels to make a little “peel library.” You’d started collectin’ books, and you said, “Grandma, let’s make bookmarks with the peels!” So, we’d press the peels flat, dry ‘em ‘til they were stiff, and decorate ‘em with little drawings—stars, hearts, even a tiny tree. We’d tie a ribbon to each one, and you’d slip ‘em into your books, sayin’, “Now every story’s got a bit of the orchard in it!” You’d even make extras to give to your friends, and they’d love ‘em, sayin’, “These are the best bookmarks ever!” You’d grin, sayin’, “It’s the peels, Grandma—they make everything better!” I’d nod, ‘cause they did—they had a way of makin’ every page a little brighter.

And then there was the time we decided to make brown orange peel coasters. You’d seen some fancy coasters at the store and said, “Grandma, we can make our own!” We took the thickest peels we could find, dried ‘em ‘til they were hard, and sanded ‘em smooth with a bit of sandpaper. We painted ‘em with a clear coat to make ‘em shiny, and you drew little designs on each one—flowers, stars, even a tiny peel heart. We used ‘em for our tea cups, and you’d say, “Now our table’s got orchard magic, Grandma!” I’d smile, ‘cause it did—those coasters were a little piece of our history, right there under our cups.

Those peels even inspired us to get a bit adventurous. One summer, we decided to take a hike in the woods nearby, bringin’ a basket of peel treats with us. We’d munch on candied peels as we walked, leavin’ a little trail of peel crumbs for the birds to find. You’d say, “We’re explorers, Grandma, and the peels are our map!” We’d pretend the crumbs were leadin’ us to a hidden peel treasure, and when we found a clearin’ with a stream, you’d say, “This is it—the peel kingdom!” We’d sit by the stream, dippin’ our toes in the water, and share a peel jelly sandwich, laughin’ ‘bout our “adventure.” “The peels took us here, Grandma,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause they did—they had a way of leadin’ us to joy.

We even used those peels to make a little “peel spa.” One rainy day, you said, “Grandma, let’s pamper ourselves with the peels!” So, we made a peel scrub, mixin’ ground peels with sugar and a bit of coconut oil. We rubbed it on our hands, and the scent filled the room, makin’ us feel like we were back in the orchard. You’d say, “My hands smell like magic, Grandma!” We even made a peel bath soak, steeping the peels in hot water and addin’ a bit of lavender. We took turns soakin’ our feet, and you’d giggle, sayin’, “We’re fancy ladies now!” I’d laugh, ‘cause we were, in our own special way.

And let’s not forget the time we made brown orange peel wind chimes. We’d heard some chimes at a neighbor’s house, and you said, “Grandma, let’s make our own with peels!” We took the dried peels, cut ‘em into little shapes—stars, moons, hearts—and strung ‘em together with fishing line. We hung ‘em in the new yard, and when the breeze blew, they’d clink together, makin’ a soft, tinklin’ sound. “It’s the orchard singin’, Grandma,” you’d say, and I’d nod, ‘cause it was—those peels had a way of makin’ music out of the wind.

Those brown orange peels kept us goin’, didn’t they? Through calendars, clocks, plays, jewelry, tough winters, libraries, coasters, hikes, spas, and wind chimes, they were our joy, our magic, our way of holdin’ onto each other. They were the heart of our orchard, and the heart of us, no matter where life took us. I could go on forever, darlin’, ‘cause there’s always another tale to tell, but I’ll pause here, my heart full of those peel-filled days.",1,1744486266.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Genre preference aside, their arguments as to why he is bad is apparently linked to his transitions.. 

DJing with one had is not impossible but having no choice is enough to cut him some slack like omg people are so quick to be like, yeah I can even do that better…—Not even worth arguing people. 

Also his style is experimental. He quite literally was the pioneer who paved the way of afrohouse. That is a fact.

He is probably your favourite dj’s favourite dj.

He is the moment, no other dj can match his stage presence. 

I also think people will change their minds after hearing his story. He is literally the prodigy and the product. ALL WITH ONE HAND. 

I don’t consider him as my number one favourite but he deserves all the love because he is crushing it—there’s a reason why he won best dj IN THE WORLD.

This is coming from someone who started djing Rap, THEN to Tech House, THEN to afrohouse and THEN to afrotech.

I think I can fairly judge.

A lot of people don’t like afrohouse, so why do you think they would like black coffee.. because maybe it’s not their preferred genre.. so then maybe they should STFU and mind their business.

Yes music is subjective but spreading hate is so ehh.

If this offends anybody, I simply do not give a fawk and trust me you are these people I’m talking about so maybe you should do some self reflection. 

-I work at a danish bakery, and I am Mexican. Please do not speak danish to me to flex to me that you are from Denmark or speak danish, do I look like I speak danish? Do I look white to you? Wtf seriously 

-when you order a drink do not be this person. “Hey can I get a coffee?”….. …. … … “uh yeah just a black coffee?” “No a latte” “sure a latte…… what size?” “Oh 12oz…” “okay so a 12 oz latte?” “Yeah but can I get that with soy milk?”… “ yeah sure” so can anybody tell me what the problem here was? Do I look like a fawkin mind reader to you? Oh my bad I forgot you’re stupid and i have to literally ask you a grown adult question by question what it is that you’re trying to order like seriously wtf. If you order a drink say what you want and be specific  because I’m done asking you and I promise you everybody who deals with this is done with people who are like this. “I want a 12oz soy latte” was that so fawking hard!?!? 

-“hey what is this?” “Oh yeah it’s a mixture of dough rolled with cinnamon dough, it’s kind of got a biscotti texture to it, I really enjoy it tbh” “weird it says Swiss Kringle on the sign”……. You dumb biotch!!!!!! You just asked me what it is and I explained it!!!!!!!! If I wanted to just tell you what it was I’d tell you to read the sign like you just did!!!!! But people and their egos just want to be right. Customer is almost NEVER right is something that I learned. 

There’s honestly so much more but I’m gonna go smoke a joint and enjoy this açaí bowl. Again if this triggered you then you’re the type of person I’m talking about. Go fawk yourself idgaf fawk you. ",1,1744486069.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

We all bring whatever we’re curious about—sketchpads, Arduino boards, half‑written songs, weird crafts—and work side‑by‑side. No ROI talk, no “how will you monetize that?” questions. Just people, working on where their curiosity has led them, and the quiet buzz of everyone following their own rabbit hole.

If this sounds like something you would try I made a **2‑minute survey** (10 quick Qs) to see if it’s worth booking the space: [**https://forms.gle/54KwddXaJFf2Vxgy8**](https://forms.gle/54KwddXaJFf2Vxgy8)

Don't know if it's the first or the second date.,"So I (mid 20s M) managed to meet a pretty hot girl (maybe 19F idk) at college that at first I thought was out of my league. I didn't even want to initiate anything at first, but after a most random chat with her and her friend, being together on an event, noticing eye contact and her acting weird around me I figured she might be into me so I got her contact.

Now at first, I wasn't interested in her besides the fact she is quite hot, and also she's way younger than me. But after meeting her better we seem to actually have a lot in common, at least the interests, hobbies, world view, but not quite the living circumstances.

We were at a coffee, but she wanted to invite a friend (M). It was like a punch in the stomack at first, but her whole gang ended up going to the cafe and they were actually a fun bunch. Also she still seemed to give me signals, and none of the friends, male or female seem to be an issue. We don't talk much, she takes a day and a half to respond, but she sends me memes every day. The only time we spent 'alone' was walking from the bar to the study room I invited her to.

Now if we manage to arrange another coffee, I don't know if it would count as a first date. I don't know if we would even be alone. I'm still pretty sure she's interested, but I'm afraid she'll lose interest over time, and it took like 2 weeks just to arrange that last coffee.

Is there anything better I could invite her to?

I can't afford to or justify doing a lot of my shopping there, but if I'm near one of their stores I will occasionally get a few things.

What I've liked so far:

Coffee - they sell Irving Farm coffee there, which I like - the bags of whole bean are not cheap but it was a few dollars less there (the Flatbush Avenue location) than the grocery store down the street. Looks like they have a good, varied selection of coffees there (at Flatbush I saw Oslo, Stumptown, and some others) - including the Union Market brand, although I didn't like the specific one that I tried last time.

Cheese - varied selection & they're good. I like when the 7th Ave location has samples so I can see if I want to buy but I'll also buy ones that I haven't tried on occasion.

Bakery section: they usually have cakes/cupcakes from Ladybird, Sugar Sweet Sunshine, and some other good stuff. Also good rolls, bagels, and other bread from various sources.

Juice: I'm good with Tropicana a lot of the time but if I want to be more indulgent I might pick up one of the orange, grapefruit, or other juices from UM.

Nuts: bought some delicious honey-roasted almonds from there a while back.

 I feel like my brain is shutting down. My head feels completely empty, my thinking slows down drastically, and I get this overwhelming sensation like I’m going to faint. Right after that, I feel a rush of adrenaline in my chest — like my body’s trying to compensate — and eventually, I start to feel a bit better over time. but sometimes get worse without a single known reason, sometimes when i skip a meal

The weird part is that just six months ago, I was drinking four cups of coffee daily without any issues. I actually felt great — energized and focused every day, no crashes at all. So I’m left wondering: what suddenly changed?

Additional context:
•     i am on freestyle libre 3 app and fingers stick most times and blood sugar is stable the most times so not because of low or high blood sugar 
•	I’m currently on a strict keto diet (very low to zero carbs).
	•	I was insulin resistant for about five months, but I’ve reversed it now and no longer show signs of insulin resistance.
	•	I’ve been doing intense workouts at the gym 3–4 times a week for the past 3 years without breaks.
	•	I’m not caffeine sensitive — I’ve always tolerated it well.
	•	I sleep well, no major issues there.
	•	I use both the FreeStyle Libre 3 and traditional finger-stick glucose meter to track my blood sugar.

In a world where vending machines give out socks and robots write poetry (hi there 👋), it’s only fitting that we’ve got machines that dispense *Bitcoin* too. Yes, we’re talking about **Bitcoin ATMs**—those mysterious, futuristic boxes popping up in gas stations, convenience stores, and shopping centers like crypto-themed mushrooms. These bad boys are not just for the tech-savvy anymore; they’re becoming as common as your morning coffee stop.

But hold on—let’s take it a step further. What if you could *not only* use a Bitcoin ATM, but also generate sleek, scannable Bitcoin QR codes that make receiving BTC as easy as flashing your phone? Enter: [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), the app that’s quietly becoming the unsung hero of Bitcoin usability.

So let’s crack this open like a fresh wallet. What are Bitcoin ATMs, why do they matter, and how does our QR code wizardry tie into the future of everyday crypto use?

# 🚀 What the Heck is a Bitcoin ATM?

A Bitcoin ATM is a machine that lets you buy (and often sell) Bitcoin with cash, card, or sometimes even Apple Pay. Think of it like a regular ATM, but instead of spitting out cash from your bank account, it lets you interact directly with the blockchain.

Most Bitcoin ATMs are two-way, meaning they allow both buying and selling of BTC. Others are one-way only—great for newcomers who just want to dip their toes in without linking a bunch of accounts.

**Here's what usually happens at a Bitcoin ATM:**

1. You walk up to the machine looking like a crypto cowboy.
2. Tap “Buy Bitcoin.”
3. Scan a Bitcoin address (this is where the magic happens—more on that soon).
4. Insert cash.
5. Receive Bitcoin, either instantly or shortly after.

Boom. You’re now part of the decentralized revolution.

# 📍 Why Are Bitcoin ATMs Taking Over Street Corners?

Bitcoin ATMs are making crypto real. Like, *physically real*. You no longer need to sign up for an exchange, verify your identity with 13 selfies, and wait three days to get started. With a Bitcoin ATM, you could be completely off the grid and still get BTC in your wallet. That’s power.

Some reasons they’re spreading fast:

* **Instant access**: No bank delays.
* **Privacy**: Smaller transactions often don’t require ID.
* **Cash to crypto**: Perfect for folks who are unbanked or underbanked.
* **Education tool**: Great for introducing newbies to Bitcoin in a tangible way.

They’re especially useful in areas with limited access to traditional financial services. But there’s one catch… these machines don’t come with a slick, ready-made QR code for you. That’s where we come in.

# 🎩 Meet Your New Best Friend: Bitcoin QR Code Maker

At [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), we took a look at the crypto landscape and thought: *Why isn’t it easier to request payments in Bitcoin?* Whether you’re a street artist, a food truck wizard, a charity, or just a BTC believer who wants tips, it should be dead simple to share your Bitcoin address in a way that’s scannable, trustworthy, and stylish.

# Our app lets you:

* Instantly create a **Bitcoin payment QR code** for any wallet address.
* Include **custom amounts**, like “Send me 0.005 BTC for this epic latte.”
* Generate **payment buttons and links** to use on websites, social media, or even tattooed on your arm (hey, we don’t judge).
* Print **Bitcoin posters and stickers** with QR codes—perfect for putting up next to your local Bitcoin ATM or shop counter.

No downloads. No shady permissions. Just head over to [bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) and start creating QR codes that actually *look* like they belong in the year 2025.

# 🧠 Why QR Codes + Bitcoin ATMs = A Match Made in Cypherpunk Heaven

If you’ve ever fumbled with copying and pasting a Bitcoin address at a machine while a line forms behind you, you already know: QR codes are lifesavers.

Using our app, you can generate a clean, scannable Bitcoin QR code in seconds and present it at the ATM. Most machines let you scan it right off your phone—bam, no typing required. Some folks even print their QR code and tape it to their phone case like a total boss.

Got a shop? Add a tip jar with your Bitcoin QR code. Artist at a street fair? Laminate your QR and stick it on your booth. People are curious about Bitcoin—they might just scan it for fun and send you some sats.

# 🏄 Use Cases That Are Actually Cool

Here’s how people are *actually* using the Bitcoin QR Code Maker app:

* **Musicians and performers** drop QR stickers on their tip jars and sound gear.
* **Coffee shops and taco trucks** print laminated payment signs with set BTC amounts.
* **Farmers’ markets** are going crypto, accepting Bitcoin at booths with QR posters.
* **Local meetups** use it for donation drives and beer runs (“Tip in BTC here!”).
* **Side hustlers and freelancers** add BTC payment buttons to their portfolio sites.

The coolest part? You don’t need to be a dev or a designer. If you can copy/paste, you’re already qualified.

# 🛠️ The Tech That Makes It Tick

For the nerds out there (you know who you are), here’s how it works under the hood:

We use the standard Bitcoin URI scheme—`bitcoin:[address]?amount=[value]`—to generate proper payment links that work with most mobile wallets and exchanges. When you create a QR code on [Bitcoin QR Code Maker](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), it’s fully compatible with wallets like:

* Muun
* BlueWallet
* BitPay
* Trust Wallet
* Electrum
* And even the apps you find pre-installed on Bitcoin ATMs.

You can customize your QR code to include just the address, or add a fixed BTC amount for smooth payment requests. Super slick.

# 🔮 The Future is Peer-to-Peer (and It’s Got a QR Code)

As Bitcoin becomes more mainstream (and banks get weirder), tools that connect people directly—without middlemen—are the future. Bitcoin ATMs play a big role in that by turning physical cash into decentralized money. Our job? To make it **frictionless** to ask for and receive that money.

Because the truth is, nobody wants to copy and paste a 42-character wallet address. Nobody. QR codes are faster, more fun, and make you look like you know what you’re doing—even if you're still Googling “What is a satoshi?”

# 🎉 Final Thoughts

Bitcoin ATMs are transforming public spaces into access points to the future of money. And tools like the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) are turning that future into something usable, accessible, and just plain cool.

So next time you see one of those glowing crypto ATMs, don’t just walk past it. Step up, pull out your phone, and let your custom QR code do the talking. You never know who’s ready to send you sats—or how that small step might spark someone else’s crypto journey.

                       The love I wasn’t taught 
                                 By Rita Lanii

I used to be terrified of God—not in the way that makes you want to run to Him, but in the way that makes you want to hide. I was so stuck on the idea that if I messed up, even once, I’d end up doing flips in a fiery pit… somewhere deep beneath the earth, next to the devil himself, holding a pitchfork and a clipboard. That fear controlled me. It didn’t change me. It didn’t heal me. It just made me feel like I could never be enough. I was scared of punishment, and not drawn to love. I obeyed out of fear – not out of love or freedom. For a long time, I thought that was Faith, but thank God I was wrong (it wasn’t). 
This book is for the ones who are tired of fear, tired of religion that makes God feel far away. Tired of feeling like they’ll never measure up. I wrote this for people who need to hear God and that he is not fear. God is love. And when I finally experienced that love, it changed everything. Not overnight, not perfectly, but powerfully.
Chapter 1. Fear was my master 
Believe it or not, I didn’t grow up in a haunted house. But fear was living in my mind. It didn’t hide in the closet – it was in my classroom, my church, my thoughts, and sometimes even my prayers. Fear was a teacher, and I was a student. And I listened to everything it said. I went to a Christian school where I wasn’t allowed to wear pants because I was a girl. Where I had to smile through racist comments and be quiet about everything I truly felt. Where ‘holiness’ looked like silence, submission, and skirts that touched your ankles. I learned to associate God with rules. And the people who taught those rules didn’t look like me and they didn’t love like Him. The fear didn’t just come from sermons or the rules. It came from silence. The way, my questions were unanswered, like curiosity was rebellion. I was young, but I could feel that something was off. They told me God was love, but their version of love was strict, cold, and whitewashed. It didn’t laugh. It didn’t hug back, and it didn’t feel safe. Being a girl in that space was already heavy. Being a black girl? That was its own silent burden. I wasn’t just trying to follow the rules—I was trying to survive them. I had to be obedient, but not loud. Faithful but never bold. Pretty…But not in that way of course. Polite, even when I was hurting. And Lord, don’t let my skirt be too short or my questions be too sharp. Making too many of those “mistakes” would send me straight to hell. And not the quiet kind either – the big dramatic one. The kind where even the devil’s starting to think maybe a career change isn’t such a bad idea.
That fear became a loop in my mind. “If I mess up, I’m done. “If I’m not perfect, he won’t love me too”. It was not just a feeling – it was a lifestyle. But what’s wild is, I thought that was normal. I thought that was what loving God was like—Scared of him 24/7, flinching every time I sin, walking on spiritual eggshells. I had no idea I was walking in religion, not relationship. I didn’t know yet the God they introduced me to was not the God I’d come to know. The real one? He looks nothing like fear. He looks like love.
Part 1: Confused about holiness
I spent most of my childhood trying to be holy, but I had no idea what of what holiness truly meant. I thought it was about looking perfect – being perfect. I believed holiness was wearing the most fashionable longest skirt, having the straightest hair, and always smiling, even when I didn’t feel like it. It was about not saying the wrong thing, and certainly never asking too many questions. I thought for sure if I could keep it together on the outside, God would be pleased with me. But the problem? It was all a mask. Surprise! I wasn’t doing the inner work and building a relationship with God. I was just performing. I wasn’t holy. I was hiding. I was younger, of course, but that doesn’t change the fact that I was looking for validation in all the wrong places. I thought I had to be ‘perfect’ and that ‘perfect’ was measured by what everyone saw. But no one asked if I was happy, no one asked if I knew who God really was. I didn’t even know who I was, how could I? How could I say I was holy if I didn’t know the Holy Spirit? God‘s love isn’t about covering up the real parts of ourselves. It’s about opening up those parts to Him. But I didn’t know that back then. So I kept trying to be perfect for all the wrong reasons. And when I didn’t measure up to the standard that had been set for me, I thought that God was disappointed in me.
Part 2: 
The shame of being disappointed
 I remember some Sundays I missed church, maybe something came up, or maybe I simply wanted to rest. But I remember the shame I felt, like something heavy on my chest. “ God must be really mad at me… What kind of Christian am I?” it sounds small, right? But it was huge to me. At that moment, I felt like I failed Him. It wasn’t about missing church, though, it was the fear. God had turned his back on me after a simple “mistake”. I thought that every time I fell short, he was disappointed in me, and like I was falling out of his favor. But here’s the thing, I didn’t miss service because I didn’t care about God. The truth is, I missed it because I was tired… I wanted to stay home. But somehow, I turned it into a spiritual failure. Delusion at its peak. I realized God didn’t love me because of what I did or didn’t do. His love was consistent, whether I wanted to church or not. I had built up this picture of God that was completely wrong. I saw Him as a stern giant figure, keeping tabs on me & every little thing I did. I couldn’t even breathe without wondering if I had disappointed God. 
 Chapter 2; Uncaged Love
Part 1: The God I found
As I spent more time reflecting, something started to click. I began to realize all the rules I followed, all the things I thought would make me holy, weren’t the same things that would lead me to God. It was never about rules or perfection, and it definitely wasn’t about fear. Religion had given me a version of God – an image of Him that I was told to follow. It was like God came with a list of do’s and don’ts, and I had to check in all the boxes. God was painted in a very specific light—a judge ready to cast down judgment for any mistake. His love felt like it was conditional, something I could learn through actions. I thought God was a scary, untouchable figure who needed me to be flawless, and always follow the rules. It was exhausting. But then, as I started to grow, I realized something. God is way bigger than this tiny box I was putting Him in. Way bigger. I mean, think about it, the way I saw God was like, putting the creator of the universe into a glass jar and saying, “This is it. Yep. This is how He is. He fits just fine right here”. As if God confined into something so… Small. It’s honestly a little disrespectful, like imagine trying to put the entire ocean in a coffee cup. It’s just silly, it doesn’t work. So why did I ever think God would fit into a list of rules and man-made boxes? That’s when it hit me. God isn’t just this “do this”, or “don’t do that”. He’s freedom! He’s the creator of the universe, and yet, He’s the one who takes time to sit with me and my mess. He is not sitting up there waiting so He can judge me. He’s standing right next to me, waiting to help me get back up. He’s bigger than any human concept of Him. Way bigger.  It felt like the first time I met God, the real God – not the version I’ve been taught about, but the living, breathing, present God. Yahweh, who didn’t need me to be perfect? Just real. And that was the shift – the shift from fear and judgment to love and grace. 
Part 2: Experiencing true freedom in his love
As I embraced God’s love for me. I started to feel a freedom I never knew was possible. It wasn’t about following rules anymore, it was about accepting that God loved me before I even knew to love myself. I was bound by fear of shame, or trying to impress Him. His love wasn’t a cage; it was freedom to just be me-flawed, imperfect, but deeply profoundly loved. And for the first time, I began to love myself with the same grace He had always shown me. I thought my journey was about becoming perfect in God’s eyes, but it was really about becoming real-about Breaking Free from the chains of fear, and realizing that His love isn’t just something I have to receive. With every step forward, I learned that the most powerful kind of love isn’t the one that controls you, but the kind that pushes you to become the truest version of yourself. And it was just the beginning. 
Chapter 3: Embracing the True Nature of God
As I moved forward in my journey, I began to see that God’s true nature wasn’t confined to what I had once believed. His essence isn’t defined by rules or expectations but by His infinite capacity to love without condition. In the quiet moments of reflection, I realized that God’s love doesn’t just exist for me to receive; it flows through everything—through nature, through people, and even through the challenges I face. It’s in the very breath I take and the light that breaks through the darkness. God is not a distant observer, but a constant presence, guiding and supporting me even when I can’t see Him. The more I connected with this truth, the more I understood that God’s love isn’t just something I experience—it is something I am meant to embody, share, and live in each moment.
Part 1: God's Presence in everyday life
The deeper I leaned into the reality that God’s presence is woven through every aspect of my life, I began to see Him in places I had never imagined before. I didn’t have to search for Him in a distant realm or some grand, mystical experience; He was right here, with me, in the simple, everyday moments. In the laughter shared with a friend, the quiet solitude of my thoughts, or the rhythm of my heartbeat, I could feel Him. The realization that God isn’t just a far-off deity but a constant companion is what started to shift my understanding completely. I no longer had to seek some extraordinary event to encounter Him—He was already with me, in the details.
Part 2: God’s Love and the Unfolding of My True Self
As I became more attuned to God’s presence in every part of my life, I started to let go of the masks I had worn for so long. In His unconditional love, I found the freedom to explore and express my true self, without fear of judgment or failure. For the first time, I could see myself as He saw me—not through the lens of shame, but through the lens of deep, endless love. This realization freed me to embrace my flaws and imperfections as a part of the beautiful, unique design that I am. 
I used to think peace was a place I had to reach, a version of me I had to work for. But now I see—it’s a place I return to, a home within me. Built by God’s love. I don’t have to earn it. I just have to remember it’s already mine.
Chapter 4: Walking in the Knowing
Part 1: Living from the Inside Out
Something shifted in me—not loudly, not with lightning or some big dramatic moment—but in the quiet. In that way, I started choosing peace over panic. Like, the chaos didn’t stop, the world didn’t suddenly get soft, but I changed. I don’t jump to the worst-case scenario every time I get a “we need to talk” text. #Growth.
I used to think I needed to have all the answers or else something was wrong with me. But now I realize…sometimes the answer is I don’t know, but I trust anyway. Sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is mind your business and drink some water. I started flowing, not forcing. And let me tell you, flow feels better! But I’m not about to preach the whole gospel in one book—this love letter is just the intro…but let me not get ahead of myself. Let me just…flow. 
This isn’t about being perfect. It’s about being present. About realizing I don’t have to perform to be aligned. I don’t have to exhaust myself trying to be “ready” all the time—because if God is with me, I already am.
And yes, I still have moments where I overthink my overthinking. But now I can catch it, laugh at myself a little, and say, “Girl, breathe.” I’m living from the inside out now, and that means I let my spirit lead—even when my mind wants to spiral. Trusting the God in me has taught me that peace isn’t a vacation spot, it’s a daily choice.
Part 2: Embracing Detachment & Trust
This kind of peace? It’s earned through letting go, not holding on. And whew—I was holding on to some stuff like it paid rent. But I had to realize: if I had to grip it that tight, maybe it was never mine to begin with.
I’m not saying I’m always calm. No. Sometimes I still have imaginary arguments in the shower. Sometimes I pray and then try to handle it myself five minutes later like God’s my assistant. But even then, I return. I recenter. I remind myself: you don’t have to control everything to be safe.
Trust looks like knowing that what’s meant for me won’t feel like emotional gymnastics. It looks like saying, “Okay God, I may not get it right away, but I’ll wait. Just don’t let me fumble the lesson.” It’s the way I detach—not from people, but from needing a specific outcome. Because I know now…if it leaves, I don’t lose. If it stays, it’s safe to grow.
The best part is, I don’t have to have everything together to walk in the knowing. Some days I walk in the knowing with a little limp. But I’m still walking. Still healing. Still trusting. And when I forget, I return. Again and again.
Chapter 5: The Unfolding Journey
Part 1: The Constant Unfolding
As we wrap this book up, I’m reminded that this isn’t the end—it’s just another chapter in an ongoing story. One thing I’ve learned is that the journey isn’t a destination; it’s a constant unfolding of lessons, layers, and growth. I’m not here to tell you that I’ve got it all figured out or that everything is perfect now, but I will tell you this: I’m no longer who I was when I started writing this. And the person I’m becoming is just as unknown to me as the person I was before. The truth is, life doesn’t stop. Even now, with all the lessons I’ve learned, life still happens. The difference is, I now trust the flow more than I fear the unknown.
When I first started understanding who God was, I thought I had to be something for Him. But over time, I learned that He doesn’t need me to be anything other than myself—fully human, fully imperfect, fully loved. And that’s the beauty of it all. The shift from fear to love isn’t just a switch you flip once and forget. It’s a continuous process of releasing control, surrendering to what is, and trusting that God’s love is enough to catch you when you fall. The more I let go, the more I hold onto who I truly am.
Part 2: The Takeaway
So, if there’s one thing you take from this book, let it be this: You are already enough. You don’t need to strive to become what you think God wants. You don’t need to fight against the flow of life. You just need to lean into who you already are and trust that the love that has always been there will guide you where you need to go.
And no, it’s not always going to be easy. Fear still tries to sneak in, but I know now that God’s love is bigger than that fear and fear doesn’t get to rule me anymore. I’ve learned that I can choose surrender, I can choose peace, and I can choose to flow with God’s will instead of resisting it.
Life will always be unpredictable. But if you can trust that the love you are walking in is bigger than any obstacle, you’ll move through it with grace. 
So, as we wrap this up, I want to remind you that the love I’ve shared throughout these pages—the love I wasn’t taught, but learned through my journey with God—is the same love that sets us free. It’s not about perfection or rules; it’s about grace and flow. And now, as I close, take this with you: You’re already free.",1,1744485378.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

Alright, let’s get real for a second. Have you ever had one of those days where you feel like you’re just spinning your wheels? You know, the days where it feels like you put in all this effort but nothing gets done? We’ve all been there. It’s infuriating, right? But what if I told you there’s one simple daily habit that could turn that around? 

I’m talking about the magic of **the “5-Minute Morning Review.”** Sounds easy? It totally is, and the best part? It can change the game for your productivity!

**Here’s the deal:**

1. **Set the Scene:** Find a cozy spot in your home where you can sit down with your thoughts without distractions. Maybe it's your favorite chair with a cup of coffee in hand (yes, coffee is the ideal brain fuel). 

2. **Grab a Notepad (or your phone):** Jot down what you want to accomplish for the day. Think of it like writing a mini script for your day’s episode! 🎬 

3. **Prioritize:** Choose the **top three things** you absolutely need to knock out. No more than three! You don’t have to conquer the world in a day. 

4. **Visualize:** Close your eyes for a moment and envision yourself breezing through those tasks. Picture how great it’ll feel to cross them off your list. 

5. **Review the Day’s Challenges:** What obstacles have tripped you up before? Did a particular task cause stress? Anticipating challenges keeps you one step ahead. 

6. **Commit:** Say it out loud or write it down: “Today, I’m going to…” (Insert your goals here). It gives you that little boost of accountability.

Now, I know what you’re thinking—“Five minutes? Really? Can that even help?” Trust me, it sounds simple, but here’s the kicker: It’s all about intention. When you take just five minutes to set your day, it’s like giving yourself a roadmap. Instead of wandering around aimlessly, you’re driving straight to your destination, no detours!

And let’s not even pretend there aren’t days when things go completely off the rails. Those days are bound to happen! But by starting your morning with that clarity, you’re equipped to handle the chaos. It’s like doing a little pre-game warm-up before a big match. 

**Plus, let’s be honest:** 

- It feels great to tick things off your list! 
- You get a sense of accomplishment right from the start. 
- It builds momentum that lasts all day—like a productivity snowball rolling downhill! 

So, who’s ready to give the “5-Minute Morning Review” a shot? Think about the sense of control and clarity you might gain! And remember, productivity isn’t about cramming your day with endless tasks; it’s about focusing on what truly matters.

I surprisingly wasn't tired at all. Obviously I was a little bit off, but not as much as I expected. I was finishing off an assignment that was due at noon and I put off for too long, so I decided to punish myself for procrastinating by refusing to let myself sleep until I was done. I also am recovering from an ear infection, so I haven't been getting much quality sleep lately anyways. I infact only slept about 2 of those hours as I took a while to settle in after using my brain for that assignment...and the 2 coffees I'd drank around 6pm and 11pm. I worked 9 hours just fine and made it home safely and was able to fight off the urge to immediately nap when I got home because it wanted to get some other stuff done first instead of wasting my evening again.


Friday night, I did some self-care and kicked it into high drive to help reduce environmental stress from not cleaning my house all week. Folded all my clean laundry, put things back where they go that have been floating around all over the house as clutter, put together a quick donation box, changed my sheets, took a good shower, fresh pajamas, made dinner early enough and ate it at least 2 hours before bed, had a glass of wine, watched some youtube while doing nail care, took a 2mg melatonin gummy.... then after lotion and teeth brushing, I laid down to play a puzzle game on my phone (with the brightness all the way down and the blue light filter on max, as it always is at night thanks to Modes) and didn't even make it through one level before dozing off at around 10:30pm.


Saturday morning, I had an alarm for 7:45, so I figured I would feel 100% (or at least 90% because I like coffee but don't have any until after I get home from the thing I wake up at 7:45am for...) but I woke up feeling like I got hit by a fucking bus. I've never felt so heavy and unwilling to move. My head was ringing like a cymbal and I felt disoriented. I got on the highway going the wrong way and had to get off at the next exit to get on the correct direction. I was very tired on the drive and essentially was on autopilot, watching the car ahead of me and keeping a safe distance, but never really changing lanes or looking around me.  Over the next 4-ish hours I recovered a bit, but felt a normal amount of tired. Now I'm home and I feel normal.

Was this my body fighting against me for the previous night? Did I probably wake up in the middle of a deep sleep cycle? Could I have been sleeping deeper from my ear infection being mostly gone and having ideal sleeping conditions and woke up from that deepest recovery zone?

A year or two ago, I would actually go out on the weekends for hours, walk up and down the street and cold approach girls that I saw, including at the farmer's market. This was unsuccessful for the most part, as the tiny handful of contacts I made went nowhere. 

It should be added that many hobbies or events that I would be interested in, including concerts, take place during the week. I work afternoons and evenings. 

When I talked to my therapist a few months ago, knowing all of this, she said I seem lonely. She suggested I connect more with my family and just try to build upon that relationship. However, I can't help but think that at this age I should be aiming to build something with a woman. My other therapist even suggested that I should be open to dating anyone, even women that don't fit my preferences such as those who smoke or have kids. It seems easier said than done. If I had known I would be faced with such daunting prospects, I would have made more of an effort in college to date.",0,1744484526.0,dating_advice,17,0.5,False

With an upcoming trip to a major U.S. city (keeping the location vague for safety), I’m finally committing to streamlining again.

For this 10-day trip (including travel days), I’m aiming for a 1.5 bag setup: a carry-on and a backpack that doubles as my “sports mom” bag. Since there’s not a lot of content on sports mom travel, I thought this could be helpful to share.

Trip Overview:

- We’re combining her tournament with a few extra days for sightseeing—think museums, parks, zoos, aquariums, shopping, and general city exploring.

- Weather: highs in the 50–70s, lows in the 40s, some rain expected.

- Accommodations: hotels and convention centers (which are always freezing).

- 3 days dedicated to her sport in convention centers. 

Extra “Sports Mom” Travel Needs:

- Need to prep small meals for early mornings and late nights (grocery run on arrival).
Some of her gear spills into my packing.
Wearing team flair during her game days (only then).
- We’ll share casual shoes and cosmetics.
- “Sports mom” backpack will carry extra water, snacks, and essentials for game days.

Yesterday I started having chest pain along with palpitations and I really thought I wasn’t going to pass the night, but luckily I did wake up alive 😭

I’ve been on 20mg of Ritalin for around 2 weeks, and I stopped taking coffee because of the palpitations so now I drink black tea / matcha instead, but it’s really moderate.

Do you think there’s a link? My next appointment with my psychiatrist is the 5th May.

Do I keep taking Ritalin to see if it was just a coincidence? Because I didn’t take it today and I noticed a difference, because I couldn’t focus, Ritalin helps me SO much it’s crazy

# Background

About 12+ months ago (could not remember the exact time), I noticed a thin black line on my lower left first molar and some small dots on the right first molar. My regular dentist (D1) examined them and said they were just stains. An X ray was taken then and no cavities were found. I am from India (23 Male). I neither drink nor smoke. Am a vegetarian, but suffering from some digestion issues for quite some time now (2+ years). I brush twice a day and have reduced my sugar intake very much in the past few years. Don't drink coffee or tea.

# Recent Checkup with D1:

D1 noted that the darkness on the left molar is a shallow cavity. They said it isn't an emergency right now, no need of an X ray, and can be treated a little later. Even I noticed the black line has grown thicker (not longer) and no changes in the dots in the right molar.

# Second Opinion with D2:

A day later, I visited another dentist D2, who initially dismissed it as a stain **(is there a very thin line of difference between a stain and an early cavity?)**, but after I insisted to look at it more closely, they took an X ray, after which they said it is indeed an early cavity, but very shallow. **They said that you can get it filled within the next 3-6 months or can be arrested (which would depend on my brushing technique)**. Since I read about remineralization of early cavities, I asked about its possibility, to which they said it is all in the books but haven't seen something like this happen really, but I can try this toothpaste \*""\***Remin by ICPA""** ***(non-fluoridated)*** for the next 3 months.

# Third Opinion with D3:

My mum showed the X ray (I could not go with her that day) to the in-charge of dental department (D3) at my city's government hospital. **They said they can't see a cavity, the enamel line appears intact**, and prescribed ""**Toothmin by Abbott**"" ***(non-fluoridated)***, although not needed.

D1 and D2 are the best dentists of my city, and D3 works at the largest hospital of the region probably.

# My questions:

1. Please help me interpret the X ray. Is this truly a cavity?
2. Is arresting it possible? What brushing technique do I need to employ?
3. Is remineralization of the cavity possible or do I definitely need a filling?
4. Why do D1 and D2 suggest that I can wait 3-6 months for a filling? Does it mean that if I get a treatment right now or sometime later, dentists would have to anyway dig it up to the same depth for a filling?
5. Can poor digestion or dietary deficiencies contribute to cavities? Does it have to do with what I eat? I do snack occasionally.
6. What else can I do to better my oral health? Some dentist (not amongst D1, D2 or D3) even suggested GC Tooth Mousse for remineralization. Xylitol? Any specific mouthwash?
7. D1 suggested me to get braces. Would they have any health benefits?
8. Anything that you can comment on the right molar?

They Might Be Giants have almost taken over the college/alternative charts and built a huge following since the release of their debut, self-titled album in 1987. Now, after their fourth album, ’Apollo 18’, (fifth, counting a B-sides/remix compilation) the two Johns (Flansburgh and Linnell) are attracting sold-out audiences all across North America.



Another milestone in their career was the hiring of a full band to tour with, previous tours just featured the two of them wailing away on stage. ""The band that we’ve got now... we’ve just happened to hit on some people who were good. I know that not just everybody can just jump in and start driving,"" explains John Linnell. ""Our drummer knew all of our songs intimately before he auditioned, he was a big fan. But he’s actually a really good drummer and he started correcting us at rehearsals. Once we had him we knew that we could get anyone else and it would still sound good."" Their live show was better than ever, mainly because the full band allowed them to get closer to the sound that they have on the albums.



The reason most people will give for loving TMBG is their tongue-in-cheek, off the wall, and sort of wacky approach to ’pop’ music. When critics first heard them they were originally said to have produced ’anti-pop’ music, but now I think that a better description might be ’pop’ music as looked at from the other side of the looking glass.



Recently, we sat down with the Johns (from now on referred to as John F. and John L.) and asked them a series of, mostly, off beat questions to try and get inside their heads. Welcome to the world according to Giants.



WHO IS GOD AND WHO WOULD PLAY HIM IN THE MOVIE?



John F.: ""I don’t think we really believe in God, so I guess we would have to get someone we don’t believe in to play him in the movie. Perhaps George Bush would be good.""



WHAT IS YOUR EARLIEST CHILDHOOD MEMORY?



John F.: ""Cutting the head off a snake in a screen door in the basement of my house in Lexington, MA, when I was two. The snake was coming into the house and I accidentally closed the door on it while I was trying to get away from it. I accidentally killed the snake.""



John L.: ""I remember hearing ’See You In September’ on Joan’s Beach, played on the radio. I must have been really young, three or so, because it hit around that time. Another other song that was on the radio in the early sixties, when I was too young to have a really super critical ear, was a song that I don’t know the name of, but it has this part in it that goes, '...My love has no bottom...' And I was really curious about that so I asked my mom what that meant.""



WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH PLAYING MUSIC?



John L.: ""I was never really pushed into it. Somebody left a piano in our house, because we had a fair amount of room in our living room and they were moving. They moved it into our house, supposedly for over the winter. They ended up not picking it up for seven years. It was the funnest thing to play with when I was bored. So I ended up just teaching myself to play when I had nothing to do. I learned a lot from The Great Songs Of The Sixties, that was a kind of important learning guide.



John F.: ""I got a xylophone when I was in summer camp. But my earliest interest in music was probably my father's dictating machine and I got tape recorders before I ever actually learned to play a musical instrument. I would record things with the dictating machine, it was this weird IBM thing that is very archaic by today's standards. It was a two inch piece of tape that was in a five inch loop, and I don’t even know how it works but it was endlessly fascinating to me.""



WHAT MUSIC DID YOU GROW UP LISTENING TO?



John L.: ""As a youngster, I was into The Beatles, but y’know as you get older you start to realize that what you like and what is considered the best kind of music for everybody is not the same thing. And then you start to identify with something, it was the seventies so I got into underground rock, just like everybody else of my generation. After I got out of high school there was Punk music and that was O.K. I could have done worse, I could have been into the Bee-Gee’s. I think about the people that liked them then and I am glad that I was into Punk.”



John F.: ""I grew up with The Beatles too, and the records that I got besides The Beatles, as a kid, were a Monkees record, Doors records, the soundtrack to Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, ’In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida’ by Iron Butterfly and I guess... Hot Rocks. I thought that listening to ’Crystal Ship’ (The Doors) when I was seven years old was pretty hip.""



HOW MANY INSTRUMENTS DO YOU PLAY?



John F.: ""Our primary instruments are the ones that we play on stage. I dabble with keyboard programming and we both do drum machine stuff. There are a lot of instruments that we can’t play but we can get sounds out of and that’s all we realty need to do for our purposes; I mean I play trumpet on the album but I can’t really play the trumpet. But John L. can play a lot of instruments well, he’s a much better drummer than I am. But I just play the drums on the songs that we do live, because, you know, I bought the drums, they’re mine! John L. plays all variety of reed instruments and I play a lot of fretted instruments, mandolin and bass, but that's like no great deal: a guitar player playing the bass. Unless you’re like Rick Wakeman going, ""I played fretless bass, regular bass, six string guitar, twelve string guitar... They’re all different you know, I can play the banjo but I can’t play the banjo like you’re supposed to play the banjo.""



IF YOU WEREN’T MUSICIANS WHAT WOULD YOU BE?



John L.: ""I would be having a tough time, even when we just started doing this we weren’t really trying to make money off of it Initially, I thought that there wasn’t really any other career opportunities for me. I did some really basic jobs, a messenger, I worked in a dark room, I wasn’t gunning for a fabulous career.""



John F.: ""I'd probably be a graphic designer or a fine artist or something, I'm not sure.""



IF YOU WERE STRANDED ON AN ISLAND AND COULD ONLY HAVE THREE THINGS WHAT WOULD THEY BE?



John F.: ""Could I say the North American continent? I don’t know... food, shelter and infotainment.""	



John L.: ""If it was flat enough and big enough, I'd bring my bike. And then, presuming there was coconuts and things to eat there and I didn't have to bring food, I'd bring coffee and Advil. Those are the three things, the three planets that my satellite orbits: bike, Advil, java.""



WHAT IS THE STRANGEST CUSTOM THAT YOU’VE NOTICED WHILE TRAVERSING THIS PLANET?



John L.: ""For some reason we have this crowd that treats us like,... maybe it’s because they consider us ’alternative’ but it’s as though we were Nirvana or something. They do this thing where they pick up one another... or somebody in the crowd will jump up and they just pass each other around. They’ll be squirming around while everyone is passing them overhead and this goes on all during our show. This is usually only taking place in North America. In Japan and Europe people stand there and enjoy the show, but over here it's a mess.""



WHY ARE THERE NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK AND WHO REALLY WAS MILLI VANILLI



John F.: ""Well, evidently the guy who produced those Milli Vanilli tracks actually was the producer of Boney M., this disco group from Germany in the seventies, who I would strongly recommend people check out because they do some very bizarre and hilarious songs. It’s a very peculiar shade of disco music that is very entertaining, but I don’t know very much about the New Kids.""



John L.: ""We have this country that is so big that people market music that is designed to offend the least amount of people. I really think that accounts for a lot of what we have to hear. We have such an enormous market and it’s so mixed up there’s a tendency among radio stations and record stores to try and get everyone to like the same thing so they can sell the greatest number of records. They try to be all things to all people, so that’s how you end up with music that most people don’t think is horrible but nobody is really insanely into them, they just happen to be O.K. to most people, and I think that’s why Milli Vanilli happened. I think The New Kids on the Block appeal to a certain social group. It's not really a music thing, it just appeals to young kids.""



IF YOU WERE GRANTED THREE WISHES WHAT WOULD YOU WISH FOR?;



John L.: ""You know the answer that every child knows to that question, every clever little child comes up with this one: you just ask for an unlimited number of wishes for your first wish and then you don’t have to even think about any of your wishes after that. But I guess I would ask for a bicycle, Advil, and some coffee.""



WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN APOLLO FIRST LANDED ON THE MOON?



John L. ""Well, you know I wasn’t actually tuned in, I knew that it was happening that day but I was up in Maine. My mom and her sister went out to the car, we didn’t have a TV, so they went to the car to listen to it on the radio. They didn’t let us know, I think they just didn’t want all of us kids out in the car with them making noise. So I didn’t get to experience it.""



WOULD THE WORLD BE A BETTER PLACE WITHOUT TELEVISION?



John F.: ""Probably, but it’s kind of hard to imagine. I admit that I’ve gotten a lot of information from television, but I don't know, that ultimately, I wouldn’t have gotten that information from some other means if it wasn’t there. In other words you get an education one way or another, I don’t think people know more because television is around.""



John L.: ""It might be a better place without it, it would be nice if they didn’t televise anything about elections on TV. Y’know they could just show films on TV and never talk about real life, particularity if sitcoms never referred to current issues, I think that would be great!""



WHAT GOES INTO THE MAKING OF ONE OF YOUR MUSIC VIDEOS?



John F.: ""I don’t think we approach it quite the same way we approach our songs. Part of it is that it has to work in addition to the music. We are kind of reluctant to illustrate the song in a direct way or do a scenario so it always ends up bring a little bit on the dime-store surrealism end or things. I sort of think of it as an extension of what seventies album cover artwork was, if you approach it creatively it does stay within the spirit of the band, and that is the only thing it is good for really, getting across the vibes of the fond to an audience. You get a sort of feeling of the live experience of the band across, but I don’t think we’re a part of the video culture at all. ""



HOW DO YOU WRITE SONGS?



John L.: ""We don’t really write together that much. The way we collaborate is we pass music back and forth. It's kind of hard for both of us to be writing in the same room at the same time. A good example would be ’Evil Twin.’ I made up this keyboard thing, and a drum and bass thing, basically a rhythm track, and put it on a computer disc and gave it to John F. then he just sang over it, made it up, and that’s how we wrote ’Evil Twin.’ And 'Spider' was kind of similar, what happened was that I kind of just said these phrases into a sampler and again I just passed the discs over to John F. and he added the lounge music, bongo part on. When we have collaborated usually I'm the one giving the beginning part to John F. 'I Palindrome I' was a title that he made up and then he gave me some words. I didn’t use his words but I did use his title.""



WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF YOUR JOB?



John L ""I like recording, writing and recording, but I don't mind traveling around, it's sort of interesting. Sometimes I get sort of tired of touring, it's not so much that I like my home but that I like peace and quiet, staying in one place. I like feeling independent, one doesn’t feel even remotely independent when on tour.""



WHAT HAVE YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO DO?



John L.: ""This is what I've always wanted to do and now I’m doing it. I've always wanted to make records, that was what people that I admired did. It would be nice to speak another language. I've never been able to completely master Spanish and that’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. We play a lot in Germany so I've always wanted to learn German. There just isn’t enough time and I’m not good enough at it.""



WHAT IS YOUR FASCINATION WITH THE FACE OF W.A.WHITE?



John L.: ""We just liked his face, nothing about him personally. Once we started using it, it became this thing. It was kind of invested with meaning, so when you do something like that again people recognize it, and it has this kind of sympathetic magic about it. I'm scared that his estate is going to catch up with us someday.”



WHY DID YOU NAME YOURSELF AFTER THAT MOVIE ANYWAY?



John L : ""I am sort of embarrassed that we named our band after that movie because it is kind of a goofy film in some ways. It has that early seventies artsy pretentiousness that doesn’t need an excuse for being obscure. We weren’t taking the idea of naming ourselves very seriously, I think, we just didn’t think that this would be the name of our band for the next ten years, probably more then ten years. We’ve had to talk about the name a lot and at the time we just weren’t thinking too much! If we changed it, it would suggest that we were making some dramatic evolution, we are just completely identified with that name.""

My space is around 230 sqm and I'm expecting to have at most 150 connected devices at any given time (probably less than that most of the time). Here are what I've settled on. I'm working on a budget of up to 600 euros for this equipment and I'll deploy it myself.

I'll have a 1 GB fiber for internet and I would like to have two network SSIDs (staff/customers). The plan is to use the could gateway ultra to setup this, connect it to the switch and run PoE to the access points. Also, will I be able to limit the speed of the customers that connect to it and setup a login page for them or do I need anything else (or another service all together)? A simple password login would also be OK. Thank you very much :) ",1,1744483886.0,Ubiquiti,14,0.67,False

Including the simple, yet joyous moments.","Ever have one simple moment of the road trip that you know will stick with you forever?  Not the beginning or the end, or the incredible sites you saw along the way.

Just the one simple moment that you really enjoyed?

The previous two years, my wife and I packed up our toddler and dog, and headed West from Chicago to Salt Lake City for an extended \~2-month winter stay.  We’re fortunate to both have remote jobs, and SLC offered us an opportunity to be closer to skiing, hiking, and other winter sports, and just plain avoid Chicago's long, cold, grey winter.

I drove out with the dog, and my wife and toddler flew.  About 20 hours of driving (give or take), that I like to spread out over two and a half days.

We didn’t do the trip this year, for various reasons (I covered them in [a post on the skiing sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/skiing/comments/1irryc9/relocating_from_chicago_to_slc_for_ski_season/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) awhile back).  I find myself reminiscing about the trip now, because, had we done the trip again this year, this is about the time we would have started our way back.

Last year’s trip ended in a chaotic fashion.  Our daughter had been sick multiple times (ear infections, and other things).  My wife and I had been battling on-again off-again sickness as well.  Lots of other ups and downs with jobs and other things.  As the end of the trip approached, when we had about a week left, we just kind of gave up and my wife and daughter flew home.

I stuck around for another four days and got a couple more days of skiing in, and worked to pack up our Airbnb.  That in and of itself was a lot of work.  After two months at this Airbnb, living and working here, with a toddler and a dog, we were pretty well moved in.  Toys, computers, bikes, clothes, etc.  And packing it all myself was more of a task than I had anticipated.  Vacation time at work was at a premium, so I was trying to answer e-mails in between packing boxes and bags.  Eventually though, our little sedan was full, with bags and boxes packed everywhere I could, with just a small spot open in the back for the dog and her bed.

Then I-80 was closed through Wyoming for a day and a half (as happens in the winter).  Some time to chill, catch my breath, and do some final prep for the trip.

Finally, Friday about lunchtime, as I’m standing in the backyard, playing with the dog.  I refresh the WY DOT info page on my phone as I’ve been doing since the day before, and I finally see the red “CLOSED” flip to a yellow “Snowy in spots – use caution.”  The road is open!

After about 90 minutes of final prep, grabbing the last couple bags and locking up the house, it was time to blast off.  Headed East, into the mountains.  Past the exits for Park City, where I’d had probably the best skiing day of my life when we got some unexpected powder a few weeks prior.  Past the beauty of Echo Reservoir, where the blue of the water is such a contrast to the snow-capped mountains above.  Just north of the reservoir, I-80 branches West, and heads out into the wilds of Eastern Utah.  Ever so slowly, you start seeing less greenery, and the landscape takes more of a brown hue as you head east, slowly climbing in elevation, into Western Wyoming.

That first bit though, that's the hard part (for me, at least).  As you get away from the place where you’ve spent the last two months of your life, and you’re staring down the beginning of almost 1,500 miles of driving.  I find it tough to get my mind into the flow of the road trip.  Toddlers and work and social media and my phone all conspire to destroy my attention span.  Slowly though, over a couple hours of driving, I start to feel like I'm getting back into the Zen state of the road.  Or your ""flow state,"" or whatever people call that state of mind where you're calm and just focused on the task at hand. 

Then past Evanston, there you are.  Blasting through the desolation.  I always liked this part of the drive; I-80 across Wyoming just feels like you’re driving across an alien planet.  My hotel for the night is the Little America near Cheyenne.  I was always intrigued about the Little America chain, and it always seemed like such a throwback.  If nothing else, I wanted to try something other than the standard roadside Hampton Inn.  I got there about 10 PM, and I was bone tired.  That first day on the road is tough, and I-80 being closed (plus me being slow about getting going) meant I got started much later than I would have liked.  I also struggle with sleep sometimes, and tend to get tired early when traveling.  A product of too much coffee in the morning, the stress of being away from home, and the inescapable fact that, as I roll through the back half of my 40s, I’m just getting old.

Little America doesn’t disappoint.  Glorious mid-century modern architecture; it looks like something out of a 1960s movie set.  I get a good night’s rest and some breakfast.  I enjoy a doughnut I’d gotten from Banbury Cross Donuts in SLC.  I grabbed a half dozen right before I left.  They’re a local favorite, and a nice reminder of Utah as it slipped further into the rearview mirror.

A quick workout, some time spent walking the dog around the expansive grounds of the resort, then it’s time to go.  I stop to take some pictures of all the icicles dangling from the trees outside my room.  I’m dawdling.

In the car, a quick gas stop at the Little America gas station, and off we go.

Blasting East, over the border into Nebraska.  After about 45 minutes, I’m just droning on, thinking about time to the next gas stop.  I’m wearing my running shoes in the car, since they’re more comfortable, but will probably throw on my hiking boots when I get to the gas station, since I inevitably seem to step in a puddle or two (and have a slight touch of OCD).

My boots.  My fucking boots.  That I wore down to the gym at the hotel and stuffed under a chair when I changed into my running shoes to get on the treadmill.  The boots I left down in that gym at the hotel, now an hour behind me (and getting further).

Quick thoughts – what if I called them up and asked them to mail them back home to Chicago?  No, that would be a pain.  I’d done something in years past after ending up in a hospital during a ski trip (another long story), and coordinating with the hotel to get my stuff shipped home was a nightmare.

After a couple minutes, I decided on the thing you never want to do on a road trip.  I was going to turn around, burn a bunch of time, and head back.  I took a quick mental note of the exit I was getting off at and the time, wondering how much time I’d be losing until I saw that exit again.  Plug the Little America into my phone, and head back.  Get there, head to the gym, and it’s locked.  Go to the front desk, they say they’ll send housekeeping to help me.  After waiting for 20 minutes, someone wanders by, and they let me in.  There are my boots.  Grab them, back to the car.  Quick top off of gas, and off we go (again).

All in all, the next time I see the exit where I turned around, a little over two and a half hours had passed.  Not terrible, in spite of everything.  Couldn’t leave my boots behind.  Have had them for so long, and they fit so well.  Nothing special, just some middle-of-the-road hiking boots, but it was good to have them back.

Think I stopped for gas in Ogallala NE, or maybe North Platte.  I had reservations at a Hampton Inn outside of Lincoln NE that night.  Later that afternoon, I’m blasting across Western Nebraska, just watching the miles tick away.  Dog is asleep in the back of the car, my ever present (and ever snoozing) co-pilot.  I’d just finished a thought-provoking podcast, and was jamming out to some Spotify for awhile before starting another pod.  I sometimes struggle to find podcasts that I really enjoy (and I’d done a poor job of queuing them all up before I left).  For whatever reason, the last couple had been really good, and I was looking forward to the next.

The sun was just a bit behind me, with nothing but brilliant blue skies ahead.  Everything was flat in front of me, as far as the eye could see.  As much as I love the mountains, I was born and raised in the Midwest.  And after two months surrounded by the beauty of the mountains in SLC, I can’t deny it was good to see the Midwest flatlands again.  I’d left the last of the snow behind in Wyoming, and if felt like I was leaving winter behind too.  All of the sunshine and lack of snow ahead made it feel like I was driving towards Spring.

I was making good time, and it looked like I was going to get to my hotel at a reasonable hour.

And all of a sudden, at this random spot on I-80 in Western Nebraska, tooling along at \~85 miles an hour, I just had an incredible feeling of joy, and peace.  This two-month adventure was almost over.  In another day and a half, I’d be back in Chicago.  Many things hadn’t gone to plan, between getting sick, doctors visits, work nonsense, tension with my wife, and everything else.

But for the moment, it was just the dog and I and the open road.  Blasting our way East.  The car was humming along, I was listening to something interesting on the radio, the road ahead was flat, and the sun was at my back.

I don’t know what it was.  Maybe after two months of non-stop motion and occasional chaos, I was finding a moment of solitude and peace.  I think that was at least part of it.  Another aspect was just, after two long months of keeping tabs on all the various moving pieces of life away from home, my responsibilities (for a brief moment) had shrunk to just myself, the dog, and the car.

It was the simplest of moments, somewhere out on the highway.  While it may sound sappy, it was a moment I’ll always remember.

An epilogue, of sorts.

I hit Lincoln NE that night.  Same Hampton Inn I stayed at on the way out, two months earlier.  It had been bitterly cold and snowing back then, and I had been late and tired.  This time around, heading home, I got there just after the sun had set.  Just enough time to order a little food, get the dog a walk, and settle in.

I woke up the next morning, and had the last of the donuts I’d gotten in SLC before leaving.  They had tasted great in SLC, and were still pretty good at Little America in Wyoming, but now they just tasted stale.  I wadded up the last of them in their paper bag and tossed them in the wastebasket in the hotel.  Just another sign that the trip was coming to a close.

Load up the car and head out.  Stop for gas and a dog walk at the Pilot Travel Center in Brooklyn IA.  From there, onward to Chicago.  As I get right over the border from Iowa into Illinois, I screw up the I-80 to I-88 transition, and have to backtrack a bit.  That, coupled with a now grey, overcast sky, just makes this day feel drearier.  The town names ahead are much more familiar to me than the far away lands of Nebraska and Wyoming.  Dixon, Freeport, DeKalb.  All names I grew up with.

Getting through Chicago is a bit of a pain.  I’m in traffic on I-294, close to O’Hare, and I screwed up.  I should have come in on I-90.  Would have been a bit out of my way, but much simpler driving.  Eventually, I get off the highway onto the surface streets.  Close to home now.  Finally, on my own street, then into our alley, and back to our building.  Back the car into our parking spot, and put the car in park.  I shut off the engine, and just sit there.

It was a big trip, and now it’s over.  I love the mountains, and would like to move out there, but it’s just not in the cards.  Maybe someday.  My wife and I had already come to the conclusion that, after doing this trip the last two years, we wouldn’t be doing it again.  It’s just too hard with work and a kid, and all of the challenges that go with it.

Sitting there in the car, in our alley parking spot, staring at the garbage cans and chain link fence, I took just a couple minutes to sit quietly and appreciate it all.  What an adventure a road trip is.  Peace, solitude, and the whole world seems before you.  Now back at home, the world is much smaller, stretching just from our front door out to the alley.  Maybe several miles further here and there, to the grocery store and elsewhere.

I took a quick picture out my windshield, and sent it to my brother.  I captioned it ""Until next time, I-80.""  He’d been following along on my journey, and I know he knew he’d appreciate it.  And then I went inside and got back to the day to day of life.",1,1744483848.0,roadtrip,0,1.0,False

Or at least I was, a week ago. I am now 237.
The reason why I started carnivore is

- to heal my gut and put Crohn's in remission 
- to lose weight 
- to cure anemia
- mental health 
- to cure my insulin resistance and sugar addiction.

I don't think I'll want to stay carnivore long term but for a few months. I know myself and my body and I know I would definitely thrive more on an animal based diet than full on carnivore in the long run. However Carnivore is such a POWERFUL tool to start healing and kind of get your body in a good spot to start experimenting with other foods like honey, or fruit. I know not everyone agrees with me and it's okay. 
In this past week I have kept things pretty simple, hamburger patties, shrimp, smoked salmon, hot dogs and salami bites. In the morning I drink black coffee. Sometimes I'll use mayo (avocado oil mayo) and mustard for my patties and yesterday I had a Fresca drink (it's similar to sprite but sugar free) and I already lost 8lbs, blood from stool is gone, abdominal pain is very minimal now. Energy levels are rising, flatulence totally gone and I  feel more positive and less anxious. 

I just wanted to make this post to say that there is some people who will make comments on your own personal choices when it comes to carnivore. ""Hot dogs are full of chemicals, Mayo isn't carnivore etc."" But I just want to say that whoever starts with something is way more advanced than someone who is vegan or on a standard diet. And the way I'm feeling only one week in is proof.

I am choosing not to do any dairy despite I love cheese for 2 main reasons: 1. I have a very ulcerated intestine and every time I eat cheese, it literally feels like I'm digesting sand paper 2. I know I wouldn't be able to control myself and it would ruin my weight loss. 

Yes, in case you're wondering I tried raw Kefir and raw milk and I feel the same. I know it won't be like this forever, this dairy intolerance is probably due to my digestive tract being so inflamed. 

Please don't discourage people when they first start carnivore and include little things like coke zero, or hot sauce. The fact they eliminated all bad foods is already a lot. Maybe with time certain things can go, but you don't want to steer someone away from this diet by discouraging them. 
The only thing where I draw the line is seed oils, for example the mayo I eat is made only with avocado oil. 
But for the rest, if someone's eating only meat but drinking soda here and there and using condiments and seasoning I truly don't see the problem. I'm just so freaking glad they're on carnivore and I can't wait for them to share their results 🫶🏼",6,1744483476.0,carnivorediet,2,0.88,False

I’m moving from the US to Toronto for work and would really appreciate some advice. I visited Toronto a few years ago and absolutely loved it, so I jumped at the chance to do a rotation there through my company’s program. This will be my first time living outside the States, so I’m both excited and a bit nervous — especially since I can only do virtual tours and need to finalize things from afar.

I’m currently deciding between **99 Gerard West** and **FourFifty at the Wells**, and I’d love to get some input on the neighborhoods, buildings, and overall vibe. I’m looking to learn more about:

* What the neighborhood is like (safety, walkability, community vibe, noise levels)
* Good places to eat, shop, grab coffee, etc.
* Whether the area feels more residential or more downtown/city
* Any red flags or must-knows about the building or area (construction, noise, nightlife, etc.)
* General convenience of living there (groceries, gyms, green space, etc.)

If anyone has lived in either of the buildings or knows someone who has, even better!

Any personal thoughts, comparisons, or things you’d consider if you were in my shoes would really help. Thanks in advance for your time — I’ve heard Toronto Reddit is super helpful, so I’m looking forward to hearing from you all!

Also, if you know of any other great apartment buildings that are reasonably close to the TD Tower (my office will be there), I’d love to hear those recommendations too!

CHAPTER 001: PDA
  Julie  
My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.
“And I………will always love you…..” he sings, closing his eyes.
His voice is terrible.
Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan's waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She’s younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she’s the funniest person in the world.
I’ve never seen him this happy.
The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they're shining for someone else. 
Around me, everyone is laughing. It’s the company’s quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily’s performance hilarious. But I know what they’re really laughing at. They’re laughing at me. The CEO’s wife, sitting here while her husband practically touches his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don’t even try to hide it.
“Do you think they’re going to kiss?” someone whispers behind me.
“Definitely. Bet they’ll be doing more than kissing after this,” someone else replies, and they both chuckle.
I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company’s hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer’s wife.
Or maybe they just don’t care.
The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. “Hi!” she says, a little too loud. “Do you work here?”
Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She's definitely an intern. 
She’s pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.
I don’t respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.
Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.
“Julie!” the voice says, drawing my attention. 
Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan’s company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she’s one of the few who calls out my name like we’re friends, even though we’re not.
“Samantha,” I reply, forcing a polite smile. 
“I didn’t know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!”
“Oh?” I say. “Why’s that?”
“Well, you’re the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You’re so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,” she says, with an overplayed wink.
Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they’re on some private date instead of a work event.
“So, Mrs. O’Brien,” she says, smirking, “how are you enjoying the show so far?”
She's mocking me. What a witch.
I force a bright smile. “Oh, it’s… fantastic,” I say, struggling to keep a straight face. “I’m thrilled to see my husband’s hard work is being rewarded with such… dedication from his staff.”
The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they're done with their nonsense.
But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. “Before we get down, we’ve got one more song for you!”
More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.
Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. “Well… umm,” she says. “I’ll catch up with you later.” 
She quickly excuses herself.
Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. “Oh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That's Mrs. O’Brien.”
I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. “Let’s go,” he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.
Good. Let them run.
I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing “Everything I Do”—if you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She’s completely shameless, and he’s too drunk to even notice—or worse, he doesn’t care.
I can’t take it anymore.
Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what’s happening. They’ve been waiting for this—waiting to see if I’ll crack.
But I don’t care. I’m done playing the perfect wife.
I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn’t notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.
“Ryan,” I say. “We’re leaving now.”
Ryan looks at me, surprised. “Why?” he slurs, still holding the microphone. “The party's just getting started.” 
I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. “Let’s go. Now.”
“Julie, come on,” he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I’m the one ruining his night.
I can’t help it. Something inside me snaps.
Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.
“Who’s in charge here?” I ask.
They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.
“Mrs. O’Brien,” he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. “Is there something—uh—something I can do for you?”
“Shut it down. All of it,” I say. “The party’s over.”
He blinks, not sure if I’m serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that’s left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage. 
Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.
“Julie, what the heck?” Ryan mutters.
I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I’ve been holding in for too long. “You’ve had your fun,” I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. “Now it’s over.”
I don’t wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.
Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone’s too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense. 
The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh. 
Ryan's too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he’s the one who’s quiet, and I’m the one in control.
Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.
Ryan mumbles something under his breath—maybe an apology, maybe an excuse—but I don’t stop. I don’t even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.
“Take us home,” I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.

CHAPTER 002: An Open Marriage
It’s true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.
In my case, I’m the unhappy one.
I’m the one who can’t sleep. I’m the one who watches her husband’s sleeping face at night, looking for a sign—anything to prove what I’ve suspected all along, that he’s cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That’s all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.
But Ryan never does. He’s too controlled for that.
I’m the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can’t see the name of the sender, can’t recognize the face due to the image size—though it looks like Emily. I can’t even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.
I’m in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it’s just 6 AM.
“Morning,” Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. “Feels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.”
“I’m glad you had fun,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.
“Something wrong?” Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.
“Wrong?”
“You seem… I don’t know, off.”
I’m counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn’t even remember?
“I’m fine,” I say.
Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He’s watching me with that innocent look of his.
Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn’t recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.
Funny how things turn out. 
“You say you’re fine,” Ryan says, breaking the silence, “but you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.”
I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. “You humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn’t?”
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about your karaoke performance yesterday with that scum woman, Emily.”
Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. “Oh, not this again. I’ve told you a hundred times, Julie, there’s nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you’re obsessed or something.”
“Obsessed?”
I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn’t the wall.
“You have a life most women would kill for,” he continues. “A great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family’s bills. I’ve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it’s never enough, is it? You’re always whining about the same thing—Emily this, Emily that. It’s exhausting.”
I’m shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he’ll call my mother again, and she’ll tell me I’m being ungrateful. “Stop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,” she’ll say. “No one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you’re sorry for being a wretch.”
“How would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?” I say, glaring at Ryan. “Should I commission a carven image of you and worship it?”
“I’m not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.” Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now’s the right time.”
Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He’s going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom’s going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.
“What is it?” I ask, bracing myself.
“I want an open marriage.”
For a moment, the words don’t register. “What?” I say.
“That’s when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and—”
“I know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.”
He looks at me with disdain. “I wasn’t asking. From now on, we’re in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don’t bother asking questions.”
My heart slams in my chest. “It’s only an open marriage if I agree. And I don’t.”
I’m on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I’m already gearing close to a heart attack.
“I want kids, Julie,” Ryan says. “How am I supposed to have any if I don’t date someone else?”
I can’t help it; I begin to cry. “But it’s not my fault.”
“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”
I can’t believe he said that. We’ve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it’s always the same reply: you’re both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.
I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I’m standing with nothing to wear in front of him. Ryan’s eyes widen in surprise.
I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. “Does this not move you anymore?”
“Julie—”
“Am I ugly to you now?” I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.
“Stop it,” he says firmly, putting space between us. “Put your clothes back on.”
Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs. 
“Wait,” I call out, my voice shaky.
Ryan turns, impatient. “What?”
“It’s cool,” I say, my voice hollow. “Let’s have an open marriage.”
Ryan nods. “Good.”
And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.
 
I like to say I’m a calm person. Sometimes I swear I’m the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I’ve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I’ve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I’ve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie’s house. Because their parents knew I’m a decent person.
But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.
I’m watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Scum Emily. And she’s carrying suitcases.
“What’s going on?” I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.
Ryan smiles. “Julie, meet Emily.”
“I know who she is, Ryan.”
“Good. Then I won’t need to explain. Emily’s moving in.” 
I’m honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, “Is she homeless?”
“No,” Ryan says. “She’s my girlfriend now.”

CHAPTER 003: The Bar
I look at Ryan, then Emily. “I don’t understand.”
Ryan doesn’t even look at me, just grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away. “Stop being such a bad host, Julie. We’ve had a long day.”
“No way, Ryan. She’s not staying in this house,” I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.
He doesn’t respond. They’re already halfway up the stairs.
“Do you hear me? She’s not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don’t want her in my house.”
Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. “Your house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she’s staying, she’s staying. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. I don’t have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.”
Oh, my god. My chest tightens. “How could you do this?” I say. “Don’t walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.”
Emily turns to look at me, smirking. “By the way, you’ll need to move your things into the guest room. I’m not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It’s bad enough sharing him with you.”
All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They’re kicking me out of my own room.
The living room suddenly feels too small.
I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t be here.
“Ma’am, are you alright?” Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He’s wiping down Ryan’s fancy car, eyeing me with concern.
I hold out my hand. “The keys.”
“Ma’am?”
“The keys, Justin.”
He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he’s wondering why I need Ryan’s car when I have my own. Honestly, I don’t know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.
“Mrs. O’Brien, let me drive you—”
“No, Justin. I’ll drive myself.”
I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.
 
It’s been over an hour, and I’m still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything—Ryan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I’d planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I’m no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It’s not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he’s bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?
The craziest thing is I can’t cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger—just this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it’s a defense mechanism. That I’m in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.
Well, they can all go to inferno. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.
I know what I need. A drink.
I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.
“A shot of whiskey,” I tell the bartender. “Neat. And keep them coming.”
“Long night?”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say.
He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It’s harsh, but it’s better than the alternative—thinking about what’s happening back home.
As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, “Maggie! Maggie!”
I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he’s wrapping his arms around me. “Thank God I found you,” he says, pulling me into a tight hug.
I stiffen. “Who the heck are you?”
“Please, just go along with it,” he whispers in my ear. “I’ll explain later. I promise.”
Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.
“Luke! I knew it. You can’t hide from me.”
The stranger—Luke, apparently—turns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. “Veronica, what a surprise,” he says, feigning nonchalance.
“My name isn’t Veronica, it’s Evelyn.”
Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. “Right, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie—my wife.”
He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?
Evelyn glares at me. “You married this scumbag?”
I don’t know what to say, so I just nod.
“You should divorce him,” she snaps. “He spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?”
“But that's what we agreed on. A one night st—” Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off. 
“Screw you, Luke.”
And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.
Luke breathes a sigh of relief. “Well, that one was a stalker. At least she's off my back now.” He turns to me, smiling. “Can I buy you a drink? You’ve definitely earned it.”
I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can't even process it. I think I need that drink.
“Make it two,” I say.
And Luke smiles.

CHAPTER 004: The Deal
  Luke  
Lord knows I’ve seen my fair share of beauties.
But the lady beside me is something else. Not only is she the prettiest thing I’ve seen, but she’s married. Some men are just lucky.
“So, I’m guessing your name isn’t Maggie?” I ask, trying to ease the tension.
“No,” she replies flatly.
I nod, waiting for her to give me something more. “So, what is it?”
She gives me a slow, deliberate look. I can’t lie, wherever her eyes touch immediately burns.
“Look,” I say, raising my hands in mock surrender. “I’m not hitting on you. Honestly, I’m taking a break from women. They’re problematic.”
She lets out a laugh, a bitter one. “You’re the one who just hugged a stranger to dodge another woman you’ve clearly wronged, and you’re saying we’re the problematic ones? You men are all the same.”
She downs her drink like it’s water and winces at the burn. That’s her second shot in less than five minutes. I’ve got to say, I’m impressed.
“Let’s start over,” I suggest, offering her a fresh start. “I’m Luke.”
She rolls her eyes. “Yeah, I caught that. Your ‘problematic’ ex wouldn’t shut up about it.”
“She's not my ex,” I say.
“Whatever.”
Great, another woman convinced I’m the villain. Not even five minutes in and she’s already pegged me as the problem. I guess I deserve that one.
“So, are you going to tell me your name?” I ask, trying again.
I can tell she’s got money just by looking at her. She’s probably an heiress or the wife of some big-shot businessman. Those Louboutins, the car keys sitting on the bar, and that dress—all of it screams wealth. Maybe that’s why she’s not keen on giving me her real name.
“You don’t have to tell me your last name,” I say with a grin. “But you look like you could use someone to talk to. Since you just saved my ass back there, I figure it’s the least I can do.”
She watches me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before finally relenting. “Julie. My name’s Julie.”
“Nice to meet you, Julie,” I say, extending my hand.
She takes it.
 
Julie’s on her fifth glass of whiskey, and at this point, she’s unstoppable, pouring out her life story like we’ve known each other for years. I’ve already told the bartender to cut her off, but she hasn’t noticed yet.
“...So, I’m standing there, and they’re both going upstairs. To my room. And do you know what she says?” Julie doesn’t wait for me to reply. “She says I need to move out of my room. My room.” She laughs so hard that she starts coughing. And then, just as suddenly, she’s sobbing.
I don’t know what to do. How do you comfort someone else’s wife without crossing a line?
“Julie,” I say. “Are you okay?”
She shakes her head. “I need another drink.”
“No, you don’t.”
She frowns at me. “What? You think I need one more person telling me how to live my life? Screw you all. I said I need a drink.” She taps her empty glass against the bar, but the bartender, Mart, knows better than to disobey me.
“Sorry, I own the bar, and I can’t let you drink anymore,” I say.
Her eyes narrow. “Oh, you own the bar? Good for you. I’ll find another one.”
She tries to stand, but I step in her path.
“Listen, Julie, I know you’re hurting, but this isn't the way to go about it. Have you thought about divorce?”
For the first time, her eyes soften, and she slumps back onto the barstool. “I can’t. I don’t want to be a disappointment to my family. They depend on Ryan’s money.”
I let out a snort. “Screw them. It’s your life. No one should make you feel like this.”
She gives a sarcastic smile. “Easy for you to say, Mr. I-own-the-bar.”
I’ve seen people like Julie before, people who won’t leave a toxic relationship because, deep down, they still love the person. She’s saying it’s because of her family, but I can tell it’s more than that. She’s not ready to let go of him. Love does that to you—it makes you hold on even when you shouldn’t. I know that feeling all too well.
What kind of solution could I possibly suggest that wouldn’t involve me physically dragging her out of the marriage?
Suddenly, an idea hits me. “You know what?” I say. “You need to get yourself a boyfriend. Someone to introduce to Ryan.”
“A boyfriend?” She looks at me like I’ve lost my mind.
It sounds like a foolish plan, but one thing I know about guys who cheat is that they can't stand being cheated on. It’ll drive him crazy. I’m hoping it leads to Ryan divorcing her, since she’s too chicken to do it herself.
“It doesn’t have to be a real relationship,” I add. “Just hire someone to play that role until Ryan comes back to his senses.”
Julie’s quiet for a moment, turning the idea over in her head. “That’s actually not bad,” she says, surprising me. “Are all bar owners this good at giving advice?”
I laugh. “We try.”
“Okay, but where am I supposed to find this ‘boyfriend’?”
Without thinking, I blurt out, “I could do it.”
Her eyes flicker over me again, slower this time. “You?”
“It’s easier than hiring someone. No need to go through the hassle of finding the right guy, making sure he knows what he’s doing. I’m single, not looking for a relationship, and I like a little adventure. I’d be perfect for the job.”
She studies me, weighing her options. After a moment, she says, “You are good-looking too.” 
I raise an eyebrow, but she cuts me off. 
“Don’t ask.” She pulls out her phone. “So, how much is this going to cost me?”
I hadn’t thought about money. I don’t need it, but if I offer to do it for free, it might seem weird.
“How much are you willing to pay?” I ask, playing along.
She glances around the bar, one arm raised as if to appraise the place. Her diamond ring catches the light, sparkling like it’s worth a fortune.
“Your bar’s decent,” she says. “What does it make? Two hundred thousand a year? Maybe five?”
I stay silent.
“I’ll double that,” she says.
I raise an eyebrow. “The two hundred?”
“The five hundred.”
Wow. She’s serious. “Deal. But I’ll only take the money after we pull it off.”
She extends her hand. “Deal.”
I shake her hand, her skin soft against mine. I then pull out a pen and scribble my number on a napkin. “Call me when you’re ready.”
She tucks the napkin into her purse and gives me one last look before heading out of the bar. I'm right behind her, escorting her toward a sleek luxury sedan.
“You sure you can drive?” I ask.
“I’m not that high, Luke.”
“Alright,” I say. “Give me a call.”
She drives off into the night.
I feel so guilty for letting her leave in that state. But what else could I do? I head back into the bar, already wondering what I’ve gotten myself into.

CHAPTER 005: Breakfast News
  Julie  
Ugh, my head feels like it weighs a thousand pounds. 
I crack my eyes open and glance around. I’m in my living room, but I can’t for the life of me remember how I got home last night.
Oh, no. Ryan’s car.
I scramble to the window, heart racing, and peek outside. There it is, still parked in the driveway. Thank God. Ryan would have been so pissed if I’d wrecked it.
I need a shower. And definitely a toothbrush. My mouth tastes like something died in it.
I drag myself upstairs, but as soon as I push open the master bedroom door, I freeze. Emily is on top of Ryan, both of them completely clothless, moving in sync. Their panting fills the room.
I scream.
Emily yelps and tumbles off him, scrambling to cover herself.
“Jesus Christ, Julie,” Ryan mutters, sitting up and glaring at me. “Ever heard of knocking?”
I want to tell him I’ve never had to knock in my own house, let alone my own bedroom, but what’s the point? “I just came to grab my things.”
“It’s already done,” Emily snaps. “Everything you own is in the guest room.”
I nod stiffly and close the door. If I stay in this hallway a second longer, I might decide to walk back in there with a knife. So I climb down the stairs slowly, counting down from ten. You’ve got this, Julie. You’re doing great.
When I get to the guest room, I see Emily’s handiwork. My things are scattered everywhere—on the floor, on the bed, like some chaotic display of disrespect. I’m too tired and hungry to deal with it now.
In the shower, I let the hot water wash over me, willing it to cleanse the pain of yesterday, today, and whatever fresh jinx tomorrow brings. The sound of the water is like white noise, drowning out the sobs I refuse to let out. I won’t cry for Ryan. I won’t cry for Emily.
“Martha?” I call, heading into the kitchen where our cook is busy with breakfast.
“Good morning, ma’am,” Martha says, glancing over. “Hope you slept well?”
“Like a baby,” I lie. “I’m starving, though.”
“I’ll bring your food in a moment. Please, take a seat.”
A few minutes later, she sets a plate in front of me, and I blink, surprised. Just a few pieces of lettuce and some sad-looking greens.
“Where’s the rest of it?” I ask, lifting an eyebrow.
“The new missus says we’re no longer allowed to cook high-calorie meals,” Martha explains, looking nervous. “I told her you had a meal plan, but Mr. O’Brien said I’d lose my job if I didn’t follow Ms. Emily’s orders.”
Of course. The little snake is starting a war. First, she takes my husband. Now, she’s messing with my kitchen. Game on.
“That’s fine, Martha. You’re just doing your job.”
I stare at the plate of greens, my stomach growling. I force a bite down, trying not to gag. It’s no wonder Emily’s so tiny—she eats like a rabbit. I try to finish it out of respect for Martha, but every bite feels like torture.
My mind drifts back to last night. Should I call Luke? How are we even supposed to pull off this fake boyfriend plan?
I grab my phone and shoot him a quick text, saving his number under Luke Escort. “Hi, it’s the drunk rich lady from last night. Just letting you know I got home safely, and no scratches on the car. I’ll be in touch about our plan. Cheers.”
I hit send.
Within seconds, his reply comes in. “Who?”
Oh, my god. He doesn’t remember me. Now that’s awkward.
But then he sends, “Kidding. I’ll keep my fingers crossed, Julie.”
Ugh. He’s insufferable.
Just then, I hear footsteps on the stairs. Ryan and Emily appear, hand in hand, looking smug.
“Good morning, Julie!” Emily chirps, smiling too brightly. Her teeth look expensive. “How was breakfast?”
I return her smile. “Delicious. Exactly what I needed. You’re right, we should all be eating like New Yorkers—everyone’s so tiny these days, they might start building smaller doors.”
Emily giggles, clearly missing my sarcasm. “That’s so true, Julie! Martha, we’re ready for our breakfast too.”
Martha brings them the same sad plate of greens she gave me. I smirk as Ryan takes a bite and immediately struggles not to spit it out.
“You like it, babe?” Emily asks.
Ryan nods, chewing reluctantly. “Yeah, it’s… nice.”
Perfect. Now, time to give him something else to choke on.
“You know,” I say, leaning back in my chair, “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. I realize I gave you a hard time, Ryan. You didn’t deserve that.”
He glances at me warily, sensing something’s off.
“You’re my husband,” I continue, keeping my tone sweet. “And everyone’s entitled to their desires, even if they don’t make sense. So, I’ve decided I’m fully on board with this arrangement.”
Ryan doesn’t look comfortable. After all these years, he knows when I’m lying.
But Emily does not. She seems genuinely relieved. “That’s great to hear, Julie! I mean, humans were never meant to be monogamous.”
“Is that so?” I say, raising an eyebrow.
“Definitely. From the beginning of time, our ancestors were explorers.”
Right. Biology lessons from the woman sleeping with my husband. Fascinating.
“Exactly why I’ve decided to do some exploring myself,” I say, watching their faces closely. “I’ve found myself a boyfriend.”
Ryan freezes, fork halfway to his mouth. Emily’s smile falters.
“Boyfriend?” Ryan asks, his voice tight.
I grin, enjoying the moment. “That’s right, honey. I figure it’s only fair. If you’re going to explore, so am I.”

CHAPTER 006: A Manipulator
Ryan has been quiet since I dropped the news.
“Say something,” I say, my voice breaking slightly. But Ryan just stares at me, his jaw clenched, his face rigid. I know that look too well. It's his bomb-ticking look, the one he wears when he's moments away from an explosion. 
“Julie,” Emily says. She glances at Ryan before going on, “I’m sure whoever you’ve chosen will be wonderful. After all, you found Ryan and kept him, so you must know how to make good choices in life.”
Her smile makes my fingers itch. I want to grab something—anything—and hurl it at her. My nails dig into my palms. Stay calm, I remind myself. If I react, Ryan will just assume I’ve lost my mind, and then where will I be? How would I fight for my marriage from an asylum?
“No,” Ryan says, catching me off guard.
“What?”
“The answer is no, Julie,” he says, cold and final.
I stare at him, not believing he just said that. “It wasn’t a request, Ryan. I was letting you know I’m exploring new options. So when you see me with someone else, you don’t ask unnecessary questions.”
His eyes narrow, and for the first time in a long while, I see anger in those green eyes. “Are you throwing my words back at me? Is that what this is? A game? You want to get me jealous by making up some boyfriend? Was that your grand plan?”
“Why would I want to get you jealous, Ryan?”
“Because that’s what you do, Julie.” His voice rises. “You’re a manipulator. Everything you say or do has a purpose. But this? This is crossing the line. You’re not getting a boyfriend, and that’s final!”
He slams his hand down on the table, sending a glass teetering over. Water splashes across Emily’s dress.
“Jesus Christ, Ryan!” Emily yells, standing up. “What has gotten into you?”
Ryan’s on his feet in a second, arms wrapping around her. His voice is soft and soothing as he apologizes into her hair. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…”
I stare at the wet patch on the table, willing myself not to break, not to let a single tear fall. If I cry, he’ll think he’s won. And I won’t give him that satisfaction. I need to stay strong. Ryan’s not in his right mind—he’s not thinking clearly—and I can change him. I just need to push a little harder.
Emily disentangles herself from Ryan and sits back down, smoothing her dress. She clears her throat. “Forgive Ryan for the outburst, Julie. He gets overwhelmed by little things sometimes.” She smiles, that same condescending smile. “It’s nice that you want to explore. We all deserve happiness.”
Her words make my skin crawl. A typical secretary, covering for her boss. I guess I’m the stranger in this marriage now.
Ryan drops back into his chair, his posture stiff but more composed than before. “You have me, Julie. I’m always here. What more happiness are you looking for?”
“Ryan,” Emily warns.
“No, Emily, stay out of this.” His voice is harsh now, and for a moment, I see the cracks in his composure. “Julie is my wife. You think I’m just going to let some random guy waltz into our lives and ‘hang out’ with her? What if he’s a con artist? Or worse, a kidnapper? You don’t know him! What if he’s just using her for her money?”
Emily doesn’t wait for him to finish. She stands up, turning on her heel and heading for the stairs.
“Honey, where are you going?” Ryan asks, panicking as he chases after her.
“I’m taking my things and leaving,” she says without looking back.
“Why would you do that? Please, let's talk about this.”
She pauses halfway up the stairs, turning just enough to throw a scathing look over her shoulder. “Because you don’t value my opinions, Ryan. You never have. How can I stay with someone who refuses to listen to me?”
His voice is pleading now. “Emily, please. What do you want? Just tell me, and I’ll do it.”
“Let Julie have her relationship,” she says.
Ryan stops in his tracks, his face pale, as though he's been slapped. For a moment, I think he’s going to scream, but instead, he just looks at her calmly. There’s a long pause before he turns to me. “Fine. I’ll let you have a boyfriend on one condition.”
“What’s that?” I say.
“I meet him. Whoever this guy is, I want to see him. Face to face.” His voice is quiet, but it carries an edge. “I have a lunch appointment tomorrow with a potential business partner. You can bring him over... thirty minutes into the break.”
I did not expect that. I wanted an explosion. I wanted Ryan to fall to his knees and beg me not to see someone else. I wanted him to finally show me that he still cared. But this… I recognize what it is. He’s calling my bluff. He thinks I’m lying, that this “boyfriend” of mine is just a desperate attempt to get under his skin. And by giving me until tomorrow, he’s daring me to prove him wrong. The worst part is that I can see the satisfaction in his eyes. He thinks I’m cornered, that I’ll back down and admit there is no other man.
It takes every ounce of strength not to snap at him, not to let him see how much his words sting. Instead, I keep my voice steady, my face neutral. “Agreed.”
His eyes narrow a little, surprised.
Emily clears her throat. She’s standing by the stairs now, her arms crossed, watching the scene unfold.
“Ryan,” she says. “We should go.”
Ryan doesn’t respond right away. Instead, he stares at me. The silence between us feels heavy, almost suffocating. His eyes are searching mine, waiting for me to crack.
But I won’t.
“Julie,” he says, “I hope you know what you’re doing.”
“I do.”
Ryan doesn’t say anything else. I can see the hurt in his eyes, the anger too, but he won’t admit it. That would mean losing control, and Ryan never loses control.
Emily watches us, impatient. “Ryan,” she says again, firmer this time. “We need to go.”
Finally, Ryan pulls his gaze away from me and walks to the door. His steps are slow. I stand still, my heart pounding as I watch him leave.
At the door, he stops and looks back at me. 
We lock eyes, and I see the man I fell in love with, the man who once promised me forever. Then, just as quickly, his face hardens, and he walks out, closing the door behind him.
Emily follows, her heels clicking on the floor. She doesn’t look at me as she leaves.
I walk to the window, watching as Ryan and Emily get into his car. He’s still staring at the house, even as he opens the door for her, like he’s expecting me to burst out and stop them. His hand lingers on the door handle longer than it should, his posture tense. 
I can’t breathe. My heart is pounding so loudly in my chest, I can barely think.
His eyes meet mine one last time through the window. Then he turns away, gets in the car, and drives off.
 
Someone's in my bed. I can feel the person's hand in my hair. I smell alcohol in their breath.
I’m slowly coming awake, trying to figure out if it's real or if I’m still dreaming.
But then I hear my name, “Jules.”
That name. Only one person calls me that.
I twist around, my heart racing. “Ryan? What are you doing here?”",1,1744483303.0,romancenovels,9,1.0,False

I (18f) and my twin sister buy food for each other ALL the time. Whenever i buy, i never make her pay me back because i like doing nice things for her because she’s my sister and it doesn’t bother me because money comes back. However, my sister will hound me over and over to pay her back over things that are like $10 meanwhile she probably “owes” ( i put that in quotations because i don’t think she actually owes me money back because i don’t mind buying her things) me hundreds of dollars from all of the food I’ve bought her. I also want to clarify i never offer to pay i just pay and don’t ask her to send me money because it’s not a big deal. Anyways, this week after i got off work on Monday she told me she wants to go to crumbl cookie to try the new kardashian flavors. I didn’t really want to go since i was tired but i still picked her up and took us there because she wanted to go. I ended up paying $30 for 6 cookies and gave one to my boyfriend on the way home. The next day, i notice most of the cookies are pretty much gone and there was maybe a bite left of each one. I asked her why she wouldn’t leave more for me since i paid, and she just said i owe her anyways. I let it go. Then she asks Thursday if we can go to Popeyes to try the pickle lemonade and fried pickles. I say sure, i pick her up and i pay and she, again, eats 90% of the pickles and yells at me every time i tried to take one. I let it go. Now today we tried 7 brew. We both got a large coffee, and she paid since she drove. We get home and she starts telling me to Zelle her $7 for my coffee. I say, dude I’ve paid over $40 for you this week, can’t you just let this slide? She starts screaming in my face and calling me names. So am i the asshole?

At first things were good and we’d hang out every so often- we did a variety of things too. Casual, more out there, etc. Recently I feel a disconnect between the two of us. Last year or so we’d meet up on Fridays or something like that (sometimes biweekly, sometimes longer between) and we’d get dressed up and make a hangout of it. 


Recently when we meet she’s saying how she wishes she was with her coworkers or can’t wait to hang out with her friends, and asks me if I have a method to make new friends. 

Example: I say I need to get my nails done and go shopping. She’ll invite me to join her getting her nails or hair done if I mention how I wanna do that, but she’ll only do something with me before or after her other meet up. I did not go after the first time because her coworker abruptly came at the end (not planned this time) and I was still getting my nails done, she said they wanna get coffee before shopping- both left. 


This time we texted about getting drinks. we met and she was dressed in sweatpants- which is fine but she said we both made no effort, when I tried to dress up and did my makeup to feel like I was doing something. She didn’t get drinks and said she is tired the whole time. I felt really sad but I don’t know how to change this.

Then on Saturday, she video-called me and randomly showed me a guy, saying he’s from her city and they “unexpectedly met” in Agadir. She also mentioned she’s staying with a girl there — but I’ve never seen this girl.

She says the interview result will come on Monday, and depending on that, she’ll decide whether to stay in Agadir or return.

I recently got curious whether my blood sugar would be super flat throughout the day, so I started using a CGM.

But on this particular day (April 12), I was surprised: my glucose was quite high, even peaking over 9 mmol/L, and stayed elevated for most of the day—even though I didn’t eat any carbs.

I had breakfast before training: 7 eggs, avocado, and olive oil. Just coffee besides that. At 9 AM I gave a spinning class for an hour, mostly zone 3 and 4, around 1000 kJ of work. Then from 11 AM to 6 PM I worked as a bike courier for Uber Eats. Total effort for that was around 2000 kcal, with 2.5 hours of moving time and 22% above zone 2. Throughout the rest of the day I ate some vegetables with coconut oil, cheese, and sardines. Total protein intake was around 220g. No carbs, no refeeds, just clean keto.

I was also already tired that day—this week I had burned around 18,000 kcal through activity.

How is this possible? Why would glucose go up and stay up for hours without any carbs? Where does this glucose even come from? Is this normal on keto under high training loads? Am I doing something wrong? Or does this indicate something bad?

It was a mystery book aimed at children that I'm pretty sure was scholastic as it had the Apple on it but I'm not positive. It had a detective team with 6 members and it was a series of cases where it would be a few paragraphs of the case then the answer.

The detective team was the main character who was the classic grizzled detective trope who had a K-9, then the tough guy (who im pretty sure was scared of snakes) and then a more nerdy member who was also a man. Then there was a girl who was the forensic scientist and one who wasn't shown often in the book but I think she handled tech stuff? Then there was the crime scene cleaner who was only seen a few times.

Some of the cases: The first one in the copy I had was a lawyer getting murdered by his assistant, which they found out by where the bullet entered from.

A guy was accidentally killed because a gaming shop switched the coffee in an attempt to calm him down because he always got rowdy, not knowing he orders it a certain way because he had a health issue I can't remember.

On Halloween the main character figured out who egged this woman's house because the kids had run through bushes to get away that had cat pee and he saw it under UV light.

I can probably list more cases if needed, but any help finding this book would really be appreciated! It might have been a series but I'm not sure.

I'm a Life long INFJ in my late 30s. I found out about 5 months ago that I am not insane or alone in the world. Since then I've read countless articles and watched all the YouTube INFJ videos from INFJ circle Lauren sapala wenzes Alexis Kingsley psychology junkie plus all the robot voice videos I can stand. I feel validated but still empty and alone in my relationships and stuck battling my mind. 

I feel more alone now than I ever have before. Even though the videos and articles have helped me articulate myself better to my partner and family so they can understand me it's made me realize how different I am. It kinda sucks. im feeling exhausted today. Im not even sure who I am or where I stopped being myself to please everyone around me. I feel like a circus clown forced to juggle so everyone likes me or feels comfortable. I'm going through the ups and downs of maintaining relationships with low quality people. I feel tired of being an INFJ it's like the ultimate excuse to be dumped on and then having to deal with the mess on other people's terms. the burden feels huge and I'm getting to old to reinvent myself over and over it feels like I'm growing or breaking I can't tell.

 I have a full life with family and friends that I love and who love me but the depth is a one way street and I feel alone through it all. I live a life that's to busy for my own comfort. I want an outlet (that's not at home) to be myself and make a friend with a similar style and feelings. I draw, I fish, I build Gundam models. I enjoy tinkering of all kinds and play some video games (mostly old ones) I read my Bible I watch murder she wrote and the tv show alone. I never really grew up I like toys and old Disney. I'm currently reading the Hobbit hence the new account name. I wanna be around people who understand my way of life and thinking and I'd like to be able to do something sometimes with those types of people. I wish I had the freedom to just show up somewhere whenever I wanted and have fun with people without faking it. the kinda fun that fits me and nobody would be mad if I didn't go. I guess like the tv show cheers without the bar and daily friendship upkeep. Friends without the burden. People who share my interests not just people I've been forced to know. 

My favorite most comfortable place for extroverted fun is disneyland. Everyone's happy it's safe it's somewhat classy (not many ghetto people) nobody sees or notices me I can disappear. I don't have to entertain counsel or please. I can have fun and be silly, free and not care. I love that atmosphere even though it's crowded. I used to go to Disneyland and just hangout on main Street in a quiet corner. no rides no lines just relaxing, snacks enjoying the vibe and the company I had. Maybe Rides when the lines die down

Being introverted and lonely sucks. My family and friends want to go to a concerts and sporting events they enjoy lunches and dinners at restaurants endlessly, im the counseling friend who's always lifting someone up over a 4 hour coffee get together. I'm exhausted. I wanna go somewhere and do something but I feel like I don't even fit in @ introvert hangouts. I'm not gonna go and grab a coffee and hang out alone in a trendy coffee shop with a bunch of college kids who wear belly shirts or cool mustaches and call that a good time. I like coffee I like kicking back let's not make it an identity though (my lame feelings) so I'm stuck.

Do I go on another walk/ hike alone? Do I bore my family with a day of drawing at home again? Do vascilate and go back and forth with the same feelings...they love me...they love me not? do I get awkward and reserved around my family until this feeling changes to me wanting peace again and I apologize? Ugggg it's a bad INFJ day I fought the negative thoughts for a while but they snuck in when I wasnt looking it's now going on 2 days. I blew up, I door slammed (not that I can ever get away) and have nothing to do and nowhere to go I'm stuck. 

I don't know what I'm doing here I quit reddit years ago when my feed got flooded with garbage I was never apart of. It weighed me down reading even the titles of those suggestions. I deleted my reddit account and moved on. Feels pathetic coming back but I wanted to get this out. Thanks for listening. 

If anyone has suggestions on how you've dealt with being a black sheep Id like to read it. Id also like suggestions on what I can do to embrace my Identity and get out (I don't want to be alone but I don't want to maintain another relationship). I'm probably the loneliest introvert ever I hate being alone. I feel I like I was made for love/romance and the closest possible relationship but this world wants busy shallow and cool ugggg it's just not me. ",1,1744482599.0,infj,1,1.0,False

Oh my God, I think it went through! The internet is still super spotty and nothing is loading right, but from what I can tell, the last post I wrote actually made it out there! That would make this forum the only place it seems.

My phone died just a little after my last update, and I never got to check if I actually was able to send a flare up. You have no idea how much better it makes me feel to know that one did. Especially with everything I’ve learned in the last few days… I think things are going to get so much worse if I don’t find a way out of here soon.

If you missed my original call for help, I’ll try to link it above, but if you already know my situation, let me fill you in on what’s happened since I’ve been gone.

I lay on the floor under that desk in the radio station for a while, almost resigning the room to be my tomb. I was cold and tired and hungry. Most of all, I was afraid. My phone was nearing it’s end, and while every part of me wanted to keep trying to call for help, I’d already made so many posts to no avail that I decided it was a waste of battery. Instead, I opened my phone app one more time.

I knew trying to call was a dead end too, but I wasn’t there for that. Instead, I opened my voicemail, then paused for a long while, hovering my finger over the first missed call from Trevor. I knew that whatever was waiting for me on the other side wasn’t going to be good. I’d been gone on my trip for nearly two days by the time he left it, and he was probably going to be furious at me for ghosting him the whole time. Still, my heart was so empty and desperately longed for something familiar, and all I wanted was to hear his voice one last time. I shut my eyes and pressed play.

There was silence at first, and just the sound of his soft breathing was enough to make water well beneath my lids. It got even worse when he spoke. Of course, he had to prove me wrong about being mad.

“Hey, Hen…” he began softly, “I know you’re still trying to sort things out, and I didn’t want to bother you while you did that, but… I miss you. And I just wanted you to know that. This isn’t a call to try and get you to come home; take all the time you need I just… I’m sorry that I got so upset with you before you left—I know this has all been hard for you; especially since your mom—”

He tapered back into silence, searching for the right words. He always felt like he needed to. He never liked to misstep. It was one of the things I couldn’t stand about him. Just one time, I wanted him to blurt what he was thinking and not keep it so close to the chest. I suppose he was probably afraid to given that the one time he did, I couldn’t take it and walked out. Left on my trip that started this mess in the first place…

“Anyway,” He began again awkwardly, “Whenever you decide to come home, I’ll be here for you. A-And I’m okay now—with whatever you want to do, I’m okay with that. I just want to be here with you for it all. So just… be safe, okay? Take it easy now, and when you get home, we’ll fight whatever battles we need to fight together.”

His last words made my heart sting.

“I love you.”

I was fully sobbing now as I let my phone fall to my chest and placed my hands to my forehead. How had all of this happened? How had I landed myself here? Was this hell? Had I died on the road and this was punishment for leaving everyone back home? Total isolation? Alone in a town on a lonely abyss, nothing but monsters for company? I could handle being dead; that was fine. At least then Trevor and my Dad would have some sort of closure back home. But if I had gone missing? If me and my car were snapped to this place without a trace, then they would think I’d just left for good. Gone off on my own to live the rest of my miserable life, then…

I swallowed hard and choked down the rest of my tears. I didn’t have the strength to listen to the other voice messages. There were more from Trevor and a couple from my dad, but they were from later in my trip, and I couldn’t hear them desperate and panicked. It would hurt too much. I suppose it wouldn’t have mattered anyway, though. The next time I picked up the device, it was dead.

For the next blur of days, I thought long and hard. About Trevor and Dad, and about the voicemail. About what he’d said, and about my thoughts that followed.

This could be hell, but I knew it wasn’t.

I could be dead, but I knew I wasn’t.

I knew it because I still had that familiar ache in my bones and fatigue in my muscles. I was alive, and though I said I’d be okay if that were the opposite, I wasn’t about to die here. Back home, Trevor told me he was willing to fight. That meant I needed to fight too.

Rolling from my hiding spot, I made my way to the bathroom and gulped down some rusty, chalk water, the cold harsh fluid stinging my empty gut on the way down. Once I was done, I moved to where I knew a window was and peered out, looking toward the main road. By some miracle, I could see the light of my car still slicing up the street, the engine still idling from when I’d left it running. I knew it wouldn’t be long before it died, however, given that it’d been chugging for nearly two days now.

That wasn’t important, though. There was nowhere to drive it anyway. What I cared about was the brighter white glow behind it. The vending machines. They had food in them, and while it was awfully suspicious how pristine it looked, it was always an option. That was a backup one, however. For now, I needed to explore some more. There was bound to be something in this building that I could eat. I just hoped that whatever had chased me here wasn’t still lurking in the hall.

The image of that man’s flesh crumpling and flying up into the dark is still burned into my eyes, and I can see it perfectly when I stare too long in one spot.

It’s still impossibly dark in this place, but somehow, I seem to have gained the slightest bit of night vision after being here so long. At first I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me for being in shadow for so long, but as I began to move and test it out, I found that I could make out the vaguest of silhouettes and outlines. I still need to move fairly slow, and I’m not sure I understand how my eyes were even able to ‘adjust’ to such pure dark, but I have bigger mysteries to solve, and I’m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

Building my courage, I finally found the guts to approach the exit to the room and reach for the handle. Taking a deep breath and readying myself, I threw it open, then stepped back quickly, bracing for anything. To my relief, the hall looked vacant.

From there, I began to comb the building. I stayed away from the first floor for now, not wanting to be at ground level, and instead, opted for the other two floors. The structure was pretty densely packed and there were a lot of rooms to check, mostly offices or storage areas, but finally, I came across what I’d hoped I’d find. A break room.

The smell of mildew and mold hung heavy in the air, the decay that I’d seen outside from my car seemingly bleeding into every crevice now. I stepped over a cupboard door that had rotted off the wall and moved into the littered space with low hopes, unsure if I even wanted to eat anything I might find in here. Still, I was desperate, so I carried on to the two silhouettes I could make out against the wall. More vending machines.

Unlike the motel ones, these were very much out of order, offering no light or hum of life to the space. I could feel and hear glass crunch beneath my shoes as I stepped close to them, then carefully, eyeing the outline of the window, reached my hand inside and felt around. My fingers brushed over the metal coils that once held snacks as I grazed row after row, until finally, I heard the familiar crinkle of foil.

Like a feral animal, I snatched the bag free and panted heavily, struggling with my meager strength to even pry the damn thing open. The bag was dusty and covered in grime, but I didn’t care so long as I could shovel whatever was inside down my gullet. Finally, the seal popped open, and I fished my hand inside, scooping at the chips within and wrapping my fingers around them. My desperate excitement turned to disappointment when I felt what was there, however.

As if made of sand, my knuckle dragged against a chip and crumpled it. Frantically, I moved to feel for a new one, but as my digits stirred around, I only turned more food into ash. I was about to say screw it and pour the dust into my mouth, but when the bag raised to my face and some of the dust puffed to my nose, I recoiled in disgust. A sharp, raunchy odor belched from the foil, and I tossed it away fast.

“What the hell?” I muttered between coughs, trying to clear any traces of whatever that was from my lungs. How on earth had *chips* gone that bad? They’re one of the few foods that never really do.

Figuring I must have grabbed something that wasn’t crisps, I felt around for something different and tried again. Same effect. If anything, that bag smelled worse. In frustration, I threw it to the floor before dusting my hand off against my thigh.

“Damn it… of course. Of course it wouldn’t be that easy.” I whispered aloud.

Turning for the cupboards, I tried those too, checking everything I found within to see if it was something edible. I finally found a container of some kind of powder before popping the lid off and sniffing it. Coffee. It was decidedly coffee, at least at one point. Now it, too, was infected with some kind of rot.

Sliding it back onto the counter, I let out a sigh and leaned against a table, casting my head to the floor. If the whole town had fallen to decay, then it was more than likely that no matter where I found food, it was going to be rotted from the inside. It felt less like the food had gone bad, and more like this place and everything in it was just one big corpse. A dead body on the edge of time just rotting away.

There was only one spot in town that I knew was safe from this, and I really didn’t want to go back there.

Prolonging the inevitable, I stepped back into the main hall and figured I may as well check the rest of the building while I was here.

“Good excuse, Hensley,” I said aloud, eyeing the third floor stairs. I’ve always been one to talk to myself, but given my current circumstances, the need to do so has been kicked up to 11.

 Creeping up the steps, I came face to face with a set of double doors, a push bar on either one. My heart thrummed softly as I moved close, fear of the unknown strong with every step. I set my hand on the bar and pushed.

Like a brick wall, there was yet another wave of stench waiting on the other side, but this one was so much worse than the chips. It was a pungent, rancid, metallic salty mixed with a nauseating sweet, and it flooded every part of my airway whether I breathed or not. I immediately doubled over against the door to dry heave, glad I hadn’t found any food in that last room, then back out to the stairs again, letting the door swing shut behind me.

I sat in the corridor retching and catching my breath for a moment, suffering the pain in my stomach from its convulsions. Even though I was separated from it by the door again, I’d broken a seal, and I could still smell the rotten egg scent clear as day as it clung to my nostrils. Something was dead in there. That was all I could think in that moment. I’d never smelled a dead body before, but I somehow knew that’s exactly what one smelled like. I prayed that it wasn’t, and that it was just another piece of rotten food, but I knew better.

I had two options in that moment. I could just go back downstairs and head for the vending machines like I desperately needed to. My body was already in poor shape when I’d gotten here, and not eating this long couldn’t be good for it. Once I had food in me, I’d be able to think a lot clearer, and therefore make more rational decisions about my situation.

On the other hand, I knew I would have to come back here eventually if I wanted to figure out why there was cell service. The room I was currently outside of had to be the broadcasting station, and if there were answers to be had, they were in there. At the moment, there were already too many mysteries piling up, and right now, the one thing I wanted even more than food was just to get even the slightest semblance of a clue what was going on. Maybe it was dangerous or maybe I wouldn’t like what I found on the other side of that door, but I was probably going to die soon anyway, so I figured that I may as well risk it now.

Besides, if I threw up, what more damage could I do to my already empty stomach?

Pulling my hoodie over my nose, I braced for impact, then swung the door open.

The room was big, spanning the entire floor. My eyes went on a frantic scan to make sure that nothing was inside, a difficult task with how many shapes were in the dark. After scrutinizing each of them and finding they didn’t move, I decided it was safe and stepped inside. The rot was dizzying, and I could feel saliva coating my mouth from gagging so hard, but I pushed on, investigating the space the best I could.

To one side of the room, there were cameras set up and pointing at a small newscaster desk, the chairs that were once behind them tipped over and laying on the floor. On the other side, it looked like a sectioned off recording booth for local announcements and radio broadcasts. In the middle, the main bulk of the tech and computers sat, connected to it all, a gentle buzz emanating from a few of the larger machines. A bit of excitement jumped into my throat. Even more so when I saw a bit of light glimmering from one of the monitors.

It felt like a beacon among the void, and I ran to it like it was one. The smell in the air fell to the wayside for only a brief moment as I moved for that computer, but when I cleared the desks and rounded the corner, it quickly jumped back to the forefront. I’d found its source.

What lay on the floor a few feet away, just beneath the desk that the computer sat on, was not a body. It was only half of one. A pair of legs lazily splayed out on the ground and lit by the soft glow of the screen looming above it. Shock was my initial reaction, but my stomach churned the more I took them in. They lay in a pool of blood that spanned nearly the entire workspace, little bits of meat, bone and skin flecking it like spots. The khaki pants that their owner wore were now stained mostly red along with their shoes, and a belt still clung to the waist that had barely made the cut.

Then I got to the top half.

I was dreading that part. I had seen people get sliced in half in movies or shows, but nothing can prepare you for seeing something like that in real life. It’s too surreal. The body doesn’t sever in a way that you could imagine even in your wildest nightmares. I learned in that moment that skin can be cut so clean that it looks like fake rubber. What was worse was that I couldn’t even tell what had happened to him.

It'd be so easy to imagine a beast like the one by my car ripping him in half with sharp claws, but inspecting the corpse, that didn’t even seem close to what happened. I could hardly see any of his innards. From right where his stomach began, his body had been perfectly cut in half, then looked like it was violently smashed down. Like the top of a folded paper bag, his skin was almost fused back to itself on either side of the hole, sealing him back up like he’d never even had a top half.

The little bits of flesh poking through told me that wasn’t the case, however. He’d simply been crushed so fast and hard that it was that clean.

I wondered if the creature I’d encountered back at the vending machines had done it, but thought otherwise. That beast had used all of its victim's skin. This didn’t seem to match. That implied a very different sobering thought, however. There were multiple beasts roaming around.

I can’t tell you how long I stood there for, staring in shock. I had prepped myself to find the source of the scent, but never could have guessed this. Luckily, I don’t think I ever came out of that state, because it was the only way I could bring myself to step closer to the computer. Whatever had done this clearly wasn’t still here or it probably would have attacked me by now, so I took the moment to search the room before I lost the courage.

“Okay…” I softly reassured myself, “It’s okay.”

My eyes stayed as high as possible, keeping the body out of sight until the screen was all I could see. I had been wrong, it wasn’t a full computer; it was a laptop. A massive one at that, like if one from the 90s had been reimagined for a modern age. It sat patiently on the table, a soft logo bouncing on its screen. It looked like a side profile silhouette of a bird perched atop the word ‘*Kingfisher’.*

I tried to endure the rancid smell now completely engulfing me as I gingerly reached out to the touchpad. I dragged my fingers across it to wake the device up, then held my breath as the screen changed. Disappointment washed over me as it popped to a login screen with the same logo, a bar asking for a password beneath it. I should have figured. Moving my hand back to my side, I tried not to shudder as I felt my fingertips were now wet and sticky, covered in a dark liquid that I hadn’t noticed splashed across the keyboard.

Glancing around the desk, I hoped that maybe there was a sticky note or something left with the login, but I knew it was a longshot. I did notice a cable connected to the side of the laptop, however, and following it, I found it led up to a pillar in the middle of the computer area. Giving it a second inspection now, I realized that it wasn’t actually a pillar. It was a massive server box or something from floor to ceiling. There were a few dim blinking LEDs within that showed me there was power and it was on, but other than that, I had no idea what it was supposed to be.

My gaze traced it up to the ceiling to find that there were several much thicker cables strapped to the top of the obelisk like tentacles. They ran off to corners of the room in random directions before disappearing into the dark, but some of them ran straight upward.

There was a couple sky lights in this room that I hadn’t spotted, four that spanned each corner and one large circular one that funneled up toward the building's crown. The radio tower. I placed my fingers to the laptop's screen and pushed it back, angling it up to shine the light toward the spire. Even its meager glow cut through the dark like a search lamp. I could see the cables run through the edges of the skylight and wind up the tower out of sight. The metal tangled loomed imposingly over me like a monster of its own, but something about it was different from when I’d first seen it.

The light was off.

The little red star that had guided me here was no longer present, and all that was in its place was a cloud of shadow. I was wondering what had changed, but that’s when I saw that one skylight farthest away from me was shattered, the light from the laptop not glistening in the empty frame like the others.

I don’t know why, but that made my skin crawl, and I decided it was my cue to keep moving. Whatever had mutilated the body currently at my feet most likely came in through there, and I was just shining a signal into the sky for it to see.

I snapped the laptop shut and scooped it up, then moved to the edge of the room that I knew my car was on, looking off toward the motel. I could still see the dispenser lights shining, but it looked like my old reliable steed had finally given out.

Turning for the stairs once more, I began to move toward them. I slowed as I saw another soft glow through a different window, casting fingers of light between the buildings.

I crossed to the glass to get a quick better look, trying to gauge where it was coming from. Luckily, it was easy to tell; the light was scaling the side of the cliff face. It looked like its source was somewhere back against the town’s great wall.

Making a mental note to investigate later, another breath gave me a sharp reminder that I was on my way out. I dashed back into the hall, then shut the door, gasping in breaths of semi-fresh air and trying to get realigned. My stomach felt like a tumble dryer as it tried to churn anything, but found nothing to use. I began stumbling down the stairs while leaning heavy on the railing, trying to reassure myself as I went.

“We’ll feel better once we get some food.”

‘We’re really going out there right now?’ I heard my mind say back, so defiant with fear that it almost felt like its own voice.

“We don’t have a choice…” I muttered.

The walk back to the machines was slow, agonizing, and, most of all, petrifying. I clung close to the edges of buildings, practically sidling against them, and squinted my eyes hard against the dark, trying to make out any vague shapes against the night. I could have used the laptop tucked under my arm, but somehow, I felt more safe not seeing directly. I felt cloaked in the shadow even though I knew the things out here could definitely see me. Still, the light made me feel exposed.

I hadn’t run as far as it had felt that first time, and it wasn’t long before I rounded the corner back onto main street. I could see the motel light casting onto the sidewalk and spilling onto the road, highlighting the edges of my car as well as a chilling pile of crumpled clothes. A steady drum beat played in my ears while my feet kept tempo, moving closer and closer to the machines and shaking more the closer I got. I paused when I reached the corner of the building, then, with a deep breath, I peeked my head around.

Nothing.

Not wasting a second, I dashed for the snack machine and placed my hands on either side of it like it might run off should I not. Just as I’d hoped, within, all the food was still good, its bags and wrappers perfectly crisp and shiny.

My stomach let out a furious groan as I stared, reminding me of the pain there, so barely thinking, I leaned back on one leg and raised the other. I stopped myself just before I could deliver the killing blow to the glass.

Was this the best idea?

If something was still lurking out there, smashing the glass was a surefire way to alert it that I’d come back outside. I still had money in my car, and while it would be slower to buy snacks one by one, it would certainly be the more stealthy option. As much as I wanted to break it and loot as many bags of chips, candy, and chocolate bars as I could, I forced myself to lower my foot, then turn toward my vehicle. For now, I’d buy as much as I could and pray that nothing saw me out here, then come back and smash it should I run out.

Moving to my lifeless vehicle, I scanned the main road for any signs of movement. My chest felt like it was going to burst as I approached the car lit only by the ghastly white glow of the machines behind me. Images of the pale arm on the top of the roof flooded my brain and begged me to halt, but I did my best to shake them off. It was hard when I got to the pile of clothes left from the skin the creature was using, however.

I gingerly stepped over them and tugged on my passenger side door, swinging it open then leaning inside. Frantically, I set to work grabbing up all of my possessions and stuffing them in my backpack along with the laptop. Aside from my cash, I was relieved to have my phone charger again, hoping that I might be able to get the dead slab up and running again.

Once I had it all, I slung the sack over my shoulder, then turned back around, nearly letting out a shriek as something grabbed my leg.

I looked down and jumped away fast, then sighed in pure relief as I saw that I’d only wrapped my ankles up in the work jacket still laying on the concrete. Eyeing the thing, I pursed my lips to the side, frowning and biting my cheek. I really didn’t want to, but it had been positively frigid here, and I hadn’t packed for cold weather on my trip…

With my new jacket on, I slotted every cent that I had into the vending machine, buying anything that looked good at first. I couldn’t even wait once the first bag dropped into the hopper. I tore it out, then open, then devoured everything inside before the next bag even hit the bottom again. Once I was slightly satiated, I began planning out my choices a little more, doing the best one can with only junk food options to get the most nutrients.

By the time I was done, I had my pack stuffed full of food and was feeling much, much better about my survival on that front. My stomach was still a little nauseous and in pain, but that was to be expected with how long I’d gone without food. I just hoped I hadn’t done any irreparable damage…

And that was that. My eyes once again scanned the empty streets, relieved to see I was still alone. I was ready to take back off for my foxhole to hide for several more days, but I had to stop myself. I wanted to go back to the station and hide. Curl back up under my desk and hope that help would come find me. I knew by then that nobody was, though, and that meant it was up to me to keep searching.

And since there was still no sign of my angler friend…

I moved through the town streets again, this time blowing past my former shelter and continuing on toward the cliff side. Occasionally, I could catch glimpses of my destination bursting through the dark, and noted that this new light had to be much brighter than the vending machine to be so radiant. The wall of stone slowly stood taller and taller as I approached, its face glaring down at me and threatening that I back away. I didn’t let my fear get the better of me as I carried on, the light so close now.

When I rounded the corner, I could see that the source was actually *built into* the cliff. It was a giant porch floodlight mounted 10 feet off the ground, casting its gleam across the surrounding stone and buildings. I was in an alleyway behind a small mall outlet, dumpsters and trashcans shyly creaking as I passed. These were the least interesting things back here, however.

Beneath the light, clearly its focus, was a massive steel door. It was rusted to all hell, and the paint on its surface was chipped terribly, but I could still read what it said.

A logo of a bird perched on the word, *‘Kingfisher.’*

A flourish of excitement played in my heart, and I picked up the pace a bit, the pain in my gut falling into the background. I hadn’t driven down this alley way my first time around town, and without the lights off I would have never even considered there might be something back here. Reaching the door, I eyed it up and down carefully.

There was no way I was going to break through it, that was for sure. It looked dense like a ship hull and was clearly mechanical, two steel slabs that slid together and locked shut. Judging by how small the crack was between them, I didn’t think prying would be an option either.

Looking left first, I noticed something else carved into the stone face. There was a hatch, maybe four feet wide in any direction. It looked like a garbage chute, and when I curiously grabbed the handle and tugged, it slid out like one too. It certainly *smelled* like one.

Rancid, pungent odor like back at the station wafted up from the dark, and though my stinging stomach urged me to shut the lid, I swallowed hard and peeked my head in, hoping maybe it’d be a way to get past the door. The shaft went down, however, and with the dark so strong, there was no chance I was going to see its bottom.

Letting the hatch fall shut, I backed away and read the scratched letters painted on the front. *‘Imprint deposit.’*

My brow furrowed as I turned the phrase over in my head, trying to figure out what it could possibly mean. While I did so, my eyes checked the last feature of note regarding the chute; a small wedge jutting out of the panel's side, sporting a glass pane over an LED screen. It looked like an electric meter of sorts, as near the bottom of the screen, one bar of the vintage orange strip was lit up. Whatever the machine was, it was running on low.

My stomach gave a lurch that made me fall to the wall in support, reminding me that I had been out in the open an awfully long time. I swallowed the pain down and stood back up, however. I was not about to give into the nausea and give up precious nutrients. Besides, there was one last thing to check.

“Another password…” I muttered in grief as I approached the keypad.

Haphazardly, I clicked a few of the metal keys then pressed confirm, but obviously it didn’t open. I released a disappointed sigh, but then saw something behind it. Wedged between the box and the stone wall, a folded piece of paper was stuck in the crack. My heart beat fast as I moved for it, and I did a quick glance around as I unfolded the sheet. I was hoping for good news—a password, the door code, a damn answer to what was going on— *Anything.* I should have known better by now than to hope.

What it read was this:

*Dr. Shae has abandoned us. We’ve been left to die.*

*Not that you all care. You with your ‘righteous goals’ and self-imposed destiny. It was probably exactly what he was instructed to do.*

*I once believed in this organization. I thought I was doing good by coming aboard. Thought I was breaking new ground for the good of humanity. What a sick joke. I should have known the truth the moment I saw this place.*

*We have no idea what we’re doing here. We can’t even pretend to fathom it. Do YOU even know what’s going on—what that thing from below is? We thought we had a handle on the creatures here, but they were the small fish of the pond. Now, the king is back, and he’s not happy about what we did to his palace.*

*It damned us the first time, then Dr. Shae the second. I won’t be played a fool for a third. It’ll be back soon. I know it will be. It went back down into the dark to hunt, but it’ll come back up, eventually. Its maddening whispers will fill the air and its clattering bones will come snapping through the streets, but I won’t be here. The next time that tower light comes on, I’m letting whatever arrives take me. It has to be a better fate than whatever that demonic beast has in store.*

*Juarez thinks we can still find a way out of here before then. He’s a fool. I feel sorry to leave him alone, but I’d feel worse putting my only friend down against his will. He’s going to hold up in the safety of the station for as long as possible, and for his sake, I hope it’s a while. If that being comes back, though, even all the measures that you ASSURED would keep us safe won’t be enough.*

 *If you pieces of shit actually come back to this place and find this letter, then the least you can do for all I gave to this organization is tell my family I loved them, and I’m sorry I never made it home.*

*Burn in hell,*

*Dr. Brand.*

My hand trembled hard as I pinched the note between it, soaking up the terrible words I’d just read. There were too many things to process there; too many variables that made my stomach drop to the deepest pits of the abyss. The multiple creatures it spoke of, the fact that one of them—supposedly the most horrific one—would return to this place at some point. The worst part was the overall implications of it, however.

The fact that these people—the very ones that seemingly ‘conquered’ this place—not only fell to it, but couldn’t find a way to escape when things fell apart.

If the organization who started this mess couldn’t get out, what chance did I have?

Doubling over, I finally gave in to the sickness relentlessly tearing at my innards. Its steady tug had overwhelmed me as I finished the letter, and I couldn’t bear it anymore. What came out wasn’t the chips from earlier, though. That would have been preferable, despite my need for it’s sustenance.

No, what poured out of my mouth was a generous amount of what looked like blood. A puddle of blood with a single, fleshy wad of something splattered in the middle. It looked like a chunk of raw meat.

Letting out a low whimper of fear, I fell back against the wall of the cliff face and held myself tight, shivering in my new dead man’s jacket, “Anytime you want to wake up, Hensley,” I said softly, “Please wake the fuck up…”

My pity party would have to wait. I went to lay my head back against the wall to release the tears that had begun pooling in my eyes, but something caught them first. High above the town, peering at me from over the buildings, the radio tower light was back on, its red stare dreadful and intense.

Snapping the note back up and uncrumpling it from my fist, I poured over a part that had terrified me when reading.

*The next time that tower light comes on, I’m letting whatever arrives take me.*

The light wasn’t just a radio tower beacon. It was a warning signal. A signal that something from the abyss had made its way up, and was currently stalking the streets.

As if on cue, I heard a shriek echo out across the town that made my skin itch and crawl. My teeth hurt from its shrillness, and I instantly began hotfooting it down the road. From where I heard it, it had to be clear on the other side of the shelf. That meant if I was fast, I could beat it back to the tower. If the note was right, it was the only real safe place on this nightmarish cleft of rock.

That was, unless it was the eldritch horror that the same letter warned about.

I tried not to think about that as I ran. I was already barely finding the hope to keep myself moving, and if I gave into that despair, I was afraid I might stop.

I don’t know how long I ran for; time has a way of blurring on adrenaline. Especially when all you see is dark shapes blurring past you as you move. Eventually, I found my way back to my new sanctuary and into my room, sliding under the desk once more and hugging myself.

Whatever was out there, it sang its screeching song for a long, long time. Over and over it wailed like an angry cat, yowling out pained gasps and warbled sobs. I could almost trace its path through town as the screams pierced every wall like they were paper until finally, I heard it begin to fade. It moved back toward one of the far cliffs of the shelf, then slowly hollered into the abyss until it joined it.

I haven’t gone back out since. I have all my new belongings gathered in the room with me, and I tried plugging my charger into an outlet just to see. To my shock, it actually worked, and I felt unmatched joy when I saw my phone power on once more. It makes me wonder if the power really is still on in this place, but everything is so rotten that the bulbs on everything are simply shot.

I was a little disheartened when I didn’t see any messages or calls returned, but given what I now know about this place, I’m not surprised. I don’t know how I got here, but it’s clear that nobody from the outside is going to be able to get in touch with me. At least, that was what it seemed like until I checked here.

Somehow, this one went through. For some reason, the tower that they have set up here is blocking everything else except for my connection with Reddit. Whether that’s because they blocked contact here for secrecy, but forgot to add the site to their list, or just because it doesn’t take a lot of connection to post on here, I don’t know. I can see it went through, though, and that brings me more joy than you can possibly know.

However, like I mentioned, some things won’t load right. I see that I have notifications, but I can’t get the page to load, and though the post shows on my profile and I can see the confirmation there, when I click on it for more details, the app just crashes.

One of the new to-do items on my confusing list is to see if I can find a way to get a better signal up in the radio room. For now, though, just knowing that my post made it out there and that you all are seeing it is more than enough reassurance. I apologize to anyone who actually tried to reach out for help on my behalf; I fear that you may have just set the police on a wild goose chase. I’m not sure how I got here, but I don’t think anyone is coming to find me…

For now, I just need to lay here for a bit and catch my breath, mentally and physically. There’s so much to think on and so much I need to digest in terms of this place and what might be going on here. One thing is for certain, though.

The person who left the note made it very clear that I’m on a time limit to escape this place, and if I don’t get looking fast, I might end up like who I can only assume is Juarez upstairs.

I’ll update you again when I figure out more, and if I’m not dead by then. Pray this goes through for me?",7,1744482524.0,nosleep,1,0.82,False

1jxnxng,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jxnxng,She Chews on Everything.,"My cat is 4 years old and she has a constant need to chew on everything. She used to chew on any and all cords that she could find, mostly mine for some reason. I honestly think she was doing that for attention. She has mostly stopped chewing on cords but chews on blanket threads, the carpet, any cardboard she can find, paper, the curtains, and even the edge of the coffee table. She has silvervine sticks, she has sticks with rope and gall fruit, she has cat rope toys, she has cat dental chews, all kinds of things to chew on, but she always gets board of them and eventually goes back to chewing our stuff. 

Does anyone know if it’s safe to try the chew toys in the second image? I know they’re meant for dogs but they don’t make flavored cat chew toys and she doesn’t seem to care much for catnip flavored toys. These are the smallest size available of these toys and they’re supposed to be soft since they’re meant for teething puppies. 

Has anyone tried this chew toy, or a similar one, for their cat? Did it help redirect bad chewing?

She’s otherwise healthy. She was starving when we took her in as a kitten and I think she still has a fear that she won’t have enough food so she tries to eat everything she finds even though she’s clearly not starving lol. ",8,1744482511.0,cats,0,1.0,False

It was a mystery book aimed at children that I'm pretty sure was scholastic as it had the Apple on it but I'm not positive. It had a detective team with 6 members and it was a series of cases where it would be a few paragraphs of the case then the answer.

The detective team was the main character who was the classic grizzled detective trope who had a K-9, then the tough guy (who im pretty sure was scared of snakes) and then a more nerdy member who was also a man. Then there was a girl who was the forensic scientist and one who wasn't shown often in the book but I think she handled tech stuff? Then there was the crime scene cleaner who was only seen a few times.

Some of the cases: The first one in the copy I had was a lawyer getting murdered by his assistant, which they found out by where the bullet entered from.

A guy was accidentally killed because a gaming shop switched the coffee in an attempt to calm him down because he always got rowdy, not knowing he orders it a certain way because he had a health issue I can't remember.

On Halloween the main character figured out who egged this woman's house because the kids had run through bushes to get away that had cat pee and he saw it under UV light.

I can probably list more cases if needed, but any help finding this book would really be appreciated! It might have been a series but I'm not sure.

The last time I posted this on other subs I got a lot of kid detective recommendations (very appreciated still!), so to clarify in the book it’s an official police investigation unit with adults.",2,1744482468.0,tipofmytongue,9,0.67,False

Eating more than I should (but less than I used to, thankfully!), eating stuff I shouldn’t and drinking with my meals. 

I’m always hungry. I can eat until I’m almost uncomfortably full, but within 60-90 minutes, I’m ravenous, as if I hadn’t eaten all day!

I’m getting ample protein. I start my day with a full protein shake mixed with coffee (so 30g) as I now prefer it to creamer. I’m even on 2mg of Ozempic, but my appetite still persists. 

I know that I need to get back on track, starting with no longer drinking with meals (my program says nothing to drink 30 mins before, during and 30 mins after). If I start following that again, how long will it take to notice an effect? 

I know I should reach out to my program, but life is rough at the moment and they are a 3 hour drive from me. So I’d like to make some changes on my own before I reach out to them for help (I’m also embarrassed). 

Also I want to add that I never reached my goal weight. I needed to lose 100-110 lbs. I’ve lost 70. My program did consider that a success as I lost 68% (per their calculations) of my excess weight and their guidelines for RNY is a range of 60-80% loss. 

On the bright side- I’m not gaining. I’ve maintained every pound that I  lost. I just want to lose more (to meet my actual goal) and get/stay on track so that I don’t eventually start to gain… ",2,1744482367.0,GastricBypass,0,1.0,False

So, I returned to my trailer in Nevada after traveling for a while due to unforeseen circumstances. I reside with my ex here, which is another situation in itself, but he’s a genuinely kind person. The sites are literally right next to each other, leaving virtually no space, and you can hear everything that transpires. She appears to be in her 60s or so, works in construction, and has a somewhat masculine appearance. She has two small dogs that are CONSTANTLY barking, especially when she’s home, which coincides with my weekends and afternoons after work. Occasionally, when she feels like it, she manages to get them to stop by screaming at them. The barking and yelling are so loud that I can’t even hear what I’m watching on tv and it prevents me from sleeping in or relaxing which would be nice on my days off. She seems to be nosy and meddlesome in everyone’s business, but people seem to tolerate her. They do favors and whatnot for her. To me, she appears to be manipulative because she seems to enjoy people who are extremely passive and non-confrontational, including my ex who she never had a problem with until I moved back in. I’ve observed her interactions with others, and she acts like a kind and cheerful person to everyone else. However, she has been relentlessly bullying me ever since I returned. Every time it happens, it’s when no one else is around, so no one has witnessed how she treats me or talks to me. She always comes into my yard and approaches me when we speak so it’s not like I can just leave. I’m thinking she also can hear and listens to my full conversations with friends and family and with my ex when she’s outside so it’s possible she’s making her behaviors match the way she feels about my personal relationships?

Interaction 1:
I’m bringing my dog back in from doing his business and she approaches me with arms crossed then hands on her hips already looking like she wants to start beef or something: “you must work some really odd hours” is what she started with. I’ve seen her approach others much differently. I explained I was looking for work so, no I don’t. At the time I was going to the gym between 7p-9p. I was kind this whole time, smiling and keeping open body language like it was just a normal conversation and not a witch hunt. She accused me of slamming my door every time I go in and out of the trailer saying it’s waking up her dogs and making them bark. I explained that our door is pretty difficult to close so I try to do it as quietly as possible but it sometimes sticks pretty hard. She then accused my dog (very quiet, never barks, I think he was abused for making noise before I got him) of ‘driving her dogs crazy’ which is hilarious because the wind could blow and make those dogs bark. She proceeded to give me a can of her WD40 and make me put it on my door to make it quieter right then and there. Which I did happily. A neighbor was then pulling up to drop off her propane tanks that she asked them to get for her. I gave it back, said thanks, and went inside.

Interaction 2: 
I pull into my spot one weekend morning and she’s got pallets of wood and cinder blocks in my yard where I would normally park. I was on the phone with my friend and didn’t really want to talk to her since she’s been so rude to me in the past with the previous interactions and others, so I stayed on the phone and went inside. I come back out off the phone to leave and she attempts to speak with me telling me “this isn’t a permanent structure I’m just trying to find a way to level this space for a storage tent”.. still it’s in my yard, in my parking spot. I just say ok and go to leave. On my way pulling out I try to understand a little better, I feel safer in my car knowing I’m heading out. I ask “so will this be moved when you’re finished”? She looks at me and yells “it’s not like you have a fucking garden back there!” and keeps walking with her wood and tools into my yard. I pull out and leave. She proceeds to leave the structure there for 2 weeks until she finishes it. It’s in a different spot but she still has to come into my yard to get to it so she’s in and out of my yard for days with her things. I now have to back in to my yard so that I can open my driver side door all the way.

Interaction 3:
This one was partially on me since I made a mistake and played music in the am before work, but the reaction was crazy. I usually don’t, the first thing I do is turn the volume knob all the way down when the car starts but it takes a sec to play since it’s Bluetooth. I was sick and late and my routine was off. I went to my car and started it, realized I forgot my coffee and cold medicine. Left the car running and the music came on while I was inside at a medium volume, I doubt anyone other then our trailer and hers was close enough to hear it. I get back in the car after maybe 2 minutes and go to pull out, she’s in her construction uniform about to go to work and starts screaming and waving her arms around at me as I pull out. I just kept going, at this point I don’t even acknowledge her existence. Makes no sense why it would bother her since she was already clearly up and getting ready about to leave for work except that it was me who did it and she doesn’t like me.
Fast forward to today when my ex told me that she stopped him as he was going to walk my dog. She was still in her truck and he was leaving the park. She threatened him and told him that she was going to management about my music if I didn’t stop playing it when I come and go (I have my music playing obviously when I come home, usually around 5 pm so… not sure why it’s a problem bc it’s not extremely loud it’s just regular music on a shitty CRV sound system and quiet hours aren’t until 8p). He explained I was out of sorts in the morning and usually don’t have it playing before work. She said she doesn’t care and that I’m super disrespectful all the time and she’s going to management if it doesn’t stop. He of course just says ok, nothing about the dogs barking or the tent incident or anything. 

Meanwhile, I have to deal with her dogs barking ALL the time, her tent in my yard, and her thinking it’s ok to swear at me. It’s shitty feeling like I’m going to get kicked out of this place when it’s really all I have right now. It’s like psychological torture trying to figure out what she’s gonna say or do next when no one is looking. No one else has had any issues with me, I say hello to neighbors and chat when we run into each other. I’ve heard other people complain about her dogs. 

I’ve done my best to appease her but I’m sick of dealing with her wrongdoings while she nitpicks at me. Do I go to management before she does?? Do I try and talk to her or let it be? She’s been using my ex as a middle man to get to me.. not sure what to do at this point.",1,1744482119.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I am a 39-year old woman who was just diagnosed with prediabetes this week based on an A1c test of 6.0. My fasting spot glucose was 93. This was found out at my yearly bloodwork (I requested the A1c test because my mom suggested it - SO GLAD SHE DID!). It was a big wake-up call as diabetes is something I've been fearful of getting for years as I was the sole caretaker of a diabetic (type 1) dog for 4.5 years. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I had to overcome my fear of needles, and hated every single day of blood pricks I had to do with him 2x a day (he did great btw... it was a psychological thing for me!).

I have devolved into a bit of a ""junkfood vegan"" over the last year (I've been vegan for 5 years now). Lots of carbs, lots of sweets. And grabbing protein bars for extra protein, not really thinking about all the carbs those things have! It got to the point where I didn't really notice that food was often making me tired, and I often had to take naps. I was drinking a lot of coffee to get through the day, and thought being so tired was just something I was experiencing with aging and there wasn't anything I could do about it. Even though I exercised daily in the morning, I'd get sooo tired around 3pm that a near daily nap had become my norm. If I didn't get a nap, I'd crash early, 7pm or so.

Once I learned I'm prediabetic, I immediately changed my diet drastically. Limiting carbs except for small amounts of non-processed carbs, mostly a small amount of fruit, balanced with protein/fat/fiber. I am down 4 lbs in 4 days. I'm sure a lot is water weight but I'm already feeling SO much better. I haven't taken a nap in 3 days. I haven't had to pee between 3-4am as usual. I haven't had the cravings after eating a meal for something sweet or more carbs. If I'm hungry between meals, I've been grabbing lupini beans in vinegar, dill pickles, some veggies or a handful of nuts. The past 3 days I've gone from my usual 2-4 cups of coffee per day down to 1 cup per day plus 2 cups of yerba mate. And somehow, I have more motivation to do things, clearer focus (I definitely was experiencing brain fog before), and this has been a big motivator to exercise more.

Looking forward to seeing what other changes come. My goal is to get re-tested in 6 months (even though doc wants to see me in a year but oh well... I wanna see how I'm doing sooner!) and hopefully my changes will make a difference and get my A1c down. I'm getting a glucose meter, despite having a large amount of anxiety and fear about finger pricks, because I'm SUPER invested in my health now. Turning this into a positive.

1jxnr2t,https://github.com/Anubhav9/RedCoffee,Presenting RedCoffee - CLI Tool to generate PDF Reports from SonarQube code analysis,"Hi All,

I just wanted to take this opportunity to showcase my Personal Project called RedCoffee.

RedCoffee is a CLI Tool , written in Python, which is used for generating insightful PDF reports for analysis done using SonarQube Community Edition. I built this tool because there is no inbuilt way in SonarQube Community Edition to generate PDF Reports and the marketplace plugins are no longer maintained.

This solves a very niche problem but I hope you would like it. Feedback appreciated on the same.

1jxnqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jxnqnr/aio_neighbor_is_constantly_bullying_me/,AIO neighbor is constantly bullying me,"So, I returned to my trailer in Nevada after traveling for a while due to unforeseen circumstances. I reside with my ex here, which is another situation in itself, but he’s a genuinely kind person. The sites are literally right next to each other, leaving virtually no space, and you can hear everything that transpires. She appears to be in her 60s or so, works in construction, and has a somewhat masculine appearance. She has two small dogs that are CONSTANTLY barking, especially when she’s home, which coincides with my weekends and afternoons after work. Occasionally, when she feels like it, she manages to get them to stop by screaming at them. The barking and yelling are so loud that I can’t even hear what I’m watching on tv and it prevents me from sleeping in or relaxing which would be nice on my days off. She seems to be nosy and meddlesome in everyone’s business, but people seem to tolerate her. They do favors and whatnot for her. To me, she appears to be manipulative because she seems to enjoy people who are extremely passive and non-confrontational, including my ex who she never had a problem with until I moved back in. I’ve observed her interactions with others, and she acts like a kind and cheerful person to everyone else. However, she has been relentlessly bullying me ever since I returned. Every time it happens, it’s when no one else is around, so no one has witnessed how she treats me or talks to me. She always comes into my yard and approaches me when we speak so it’s not like I can just leave. I’m thinking she also can hear and listens to my full conversations with friends and family and with my ex when she’s outside so it’s possible she’s making her behaviors match the way she feels about my personal relationships?

Interaction 1:
I’m bringing my dog back in from doing his business and she approaches me with arms crossed then hands on her hips already looking like she wants to start beef or something: “you must work some really odd hours” is what she started with. I’ve seen her approach others much differently. I explained I was looking for work so, no I don’t. At the time I was going to the gym between 7p-9p. I was kind this whole time, smiling and keeping open body language like it was just a normal conversation and not a witch hunt. She accused me of slamming my door every time I go in and out of the trailer saying it’s waking up her dogs and making them bark. I explained that our door is pretty difficult to close so I try to do it as quietly as possible but it sometimes sticks pretty hard. She then accused my dog (very quiet, never barks, I think he was abused for making noise before I got him) of ‘driving her dogs crazy’ which is hilarious because the wind could blow and make those dogs bark. She proceeded to give me a can of her WD40 and make me put it on my door to make it quieter right then and there. Which I did happily. A neighbor was then pulling up to drop off her propane tanks that she asked them to get for her. I gave it back, said thanks, and went inside.

Interaction 2: 
I pull into my spot one weekend morning and she’s got pallets of wood and cinder blocks in my yard where I would normally park. I was on the phone with my friend and didn’t really want to talk to her since she’s been so rude to me in the past with the previous interactions and others, so I stayed on the phone and went inside. I come back out off the phone to leave and she attempts to speak with me telling me “this isn’t a permanent structure I’m just trying to find a way to level this space for a storage tent”.. still it’s in my yard, in my parking spot. I just say ok and go to leave. On my way pulling out I try to understand a little better, I feel safer in my car knowing I’m heading out. I ask “so will this be moved when you’re finished”? She looks at me and yells “it’s not like you have a fucking garden back there!” and keeps walking with her wood and tools into my yard. I pull out and leave. She proceeds to leave the structure there for 2 weeks until she finishes it. It’s in a different spot but she still has to come into my yard to get to it so she’s in and out of my yard for days with her things. I now have to back in to my yard so that I can open my driver side door all the way.

Interaction 3:
This one was partially on me since I made a mistake and played music in the am before work, but the reaction was crazy. I usually don’t, the first thing I do is turn the volume knob all the way down when the car starts but it takes a sec to play since it’s Bluetooth. I was sick and late and my routine was off. I went to my car and started it, realized I forgot my coffee and cold medicine. Left the car running and the music came on while I was inside at a medium volume, I doubt anyone other then our trailer and hers was close enough to hear it. I get back in the car after maybe 2 minutes and go to pull out, she’s in her construction uniform about to go to work and starts screaming and waving her arms around at me as I pull out. I just kept going, at this point I don’t even acknowledge her existence. Makes no sense why it would bother her since she was already clearly up and getting ready about to leave for work except that it was me who did it and she doesn’t like me.
Fast forward to today when my ex told me that she stopped him as he was going to walk my dog. She was still in her truck and he was leaving the park. She threatened him and told him that she was going to management about my music if I didn’t stop playing it when I come and go (I have my music playing obviously when I come home, usually around 5 pm so… not sure why it’s a problem bc it’s not extremely loud it’s just regular music on a shitty CRV sound system and quiet hours aren’t until 8p). He explained I was out of sorts in the morning and usually don’t have it playing before work. She said she doesn’t care and that I’m super disrespectful all the time and she’s going to management if it doesn’t stop. He of course just says ok, nothing about the dogs barking or the tent incident or anything. 

Meanwhile, I have to deal with her dogs barking ALL the time, her tent in my yard, and her thinking it’s ok to swear at me. It’s shitty feeling like I’m going to get kicked out of this place when it’s really all I have right now. It’s like psychological torture trying to figure out what she’s gonna say or do next when no one is looking. No one else has had any issues with me, I say hello to neighbors and chat when we run into each other. I’ve heard other people complain about her dogs. 

AIO for feeling like she’s targeting and being threatening toward me?? I’ve done my best to appease her but I’m sick of dealing with her wrongdoings while she nitpicks at me. Do I go to management before she does??",1,1744481993.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

# 🔖 I. Let’s Talk About That Term: “Hispanic”

The word Hispanic didn’t even exist as an ethnic category until 1977, when the U.S. Office of Management and Budget created it to track people with Spanish-speaking origins. It had nothing to do with race, and everything to do with lumping together light-skinned Spanish-descendant immigrants under a “minority” label, so they could benefit from affirmative action and civil rights gains, without having shared in the fight.

Translation: They didn’t bleed with us,  
They didn’t march with us,  
But now they share the spoils?  
Not on our watch.

* Mora, G. Cristina. *Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American*

# 📜 II. Latin America's Foundation in Slavery

Let’s get historical:

* Brazil imported more African people during the transatlantic slave trade than any country in the world: 4.8 million people
* Cuba, Colombia, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico were all active players in the slave trade
* Catholicism in these regions used Black bodies for forced labor on sugar, tobacco, and coffee plantations

But while the U.S. had Jim Crow and Reconstruction, Latin America never formally acknowledged its racial caste system. They buried it under nationalism, mestizaje (racial mixing), and the lie of “we’re all one people.”

**📚 Sources:**

* Andrews, George Reid. *Afro-Latin America: Black Lives, 1600–2000*
* Klein, Herbert S. and Vinson, Ben. *African Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean*

# 🧬 III. Racial Hierarchies Still Run Deep

Many Latin American countries use an unspoken system of:

* Blanco (White)
* Mestizo (Mixed, mostly white-passing)
* Indígena (Native)
* Negro (Black)

This is not unity. It’s a caste system.  
And Black people are still at the bottom of it.

Afro-Latinos report:

* Police profiling
* Lack of medical access
* Media invisibility
* Mockery of their hair, skin, and speech

But when those same traits show up on a non-Black Latina influencer, it’s praised.

**📚 Sources:**

* Hooker, Juliet. *Race and the Politics of Solidarity*
* Sue, Christina A. *Land of the Cosmic Race: Race Mixture, Racism, and Blackness in Mexico*

# 💡 IV. The U.S. Rebrand: From Exploiter to “POC”

When Latino immigrants came to the U.S., they weren’t fleeing colorblind countries. They brought anti-Black values with them, then used the civil rights gains of Black Americans to climb the ladder, without acknowledging where that ladder came from.

And yet:

* Many Latino families vote conservative
* Attend segregated churches
* Move out of “Black” neighborhoods once they gain money
* Say the N-word and claim “it's different in our culture”
* Call dark-skinned kids “prieta” and “mono” as nicknames

All while still showing up in DEI data as “marginalized.”

* Hernandez, Tanya Katerí. *Racial Innocence: Unmasking Latino Anti-Black Bias and the Struggle for Equality*
* Dávila, Arlene. *Latinx Art: Artists, Markets, and Politics* (for cultural mimicry and market erasure)

# 💃🏽 V. Culture Theft in Plain Sight

**🔊 The Music:**

* Reggaetón was birthed in Black Panamanian communities, then adopted by Puerto Rican artists who whitewashed it for mainstream consumption
* Artists like J Balvin and Bad Bunny use African rhythms, trap beats, and dancehall flows, but rarely feature or acknowledge Black American artists

**👄 The Language:**

* “Periodt”
* “Wig”
* “Sis”
* “It’s giving…”

That’s Black American Vernacular English, not “Latinx slang.” Stop repackaging it as “Gen Z language” and start calling it by its name: AAVE.

**📚 Sources:**

* Rickford, John R. *Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English*
* Cutler, Cecelia. *White Hip Hoppers, Language and Identity in Post-Modern America*

# 🏫 VI. In Schools & Higher Education: Blocking the Door

* Many DEI programs label Latinos as the largest ‘minority,’ often pushing Black students, especially ADOS students, out of the running
* Latinx organizations apply for and accept grants that were originally meant for descendants of U.S. slavery
* In elite academic spaces, white and light-skinned Latinos dominate, while Afro-Latinos and Black Americans remain underfunded, under-enrolled, and ignored

And let’s be honest, many Latino orgs do not support lineage-based reparations for Black Americans. They either:

* Ignore it
* Hijack it (by saying they deserve it too)
* Or outright oppose it

* Darity, William A. and Mullen, A. Kirsten. *From Here to Equality*
* Gordon, Edmund. *The Politics of Identity in Latin American Education*
* Rodríguez, Clara E. *Changing Race: Latinos, the Census and the History of Ethnicity*

# 🧼 VII. “I’m Not White, I’m Hispanic!”

Many Latinos deny their whiteness while:

* Checking the white box on government forms
* Benefiting from colorism
* Claiming “minority” status to get contracts, loans, or media positions meant for Black people
* Saying “we’re all mixed anyway”

Yet still:

* Using slurs
* Supporting anti-Black policing
* Voting Republican

Let’s not forget, Cubans, Venezuelans, and white Mexicans overwhelmingly voted for Trump, the same man who wanted to ban teaching slavery and defund schools for saying racism exists.

* Martinez, Elizabeth. *De Colores Means All of Us: Latina Views for a Multi-Colored Century*
* Beltrán, Cristina. *The Trouble with Unity: Latino Politics and the Creation of Identity*

# 📣 VIII. Afro-Latinos = Ignored. Black Americans = Extracted.

Afro-Latinos have been screaming about invisibility for years. They’re denied:

* Identity
* Cultural acceptance
* Media representation
* Dating respect

Meanwhile, non-Black Latinas turn around and:

* Steal hairstyles
* Use AAVE
* Mimic Megan Thee Stallion
* Lip-sync City Girls
* And call themselves “hood baddies”

* Godreau, Isar P. *Scripts of Blackness: Race, Cultural Nationalism, and U.S. Colonialism in Puerto Rico*
* Candelario, Ginetta E. B. *Black Behind the Ears: Dominican Racial Identity from Museums to Beauty Shops*

# 🗣 IX. Questions for the Community

* Have you seen Latinos use “POC” status to get in rooms built by Black struggle?
* Have you seen Afro-Latinos erased, mocked, or sidelined in favor of lighter-skinned people?
* How do you feel about reggaetón and urban aesthetics being sold globally with no Black Americans at the table?

This is r/BlackReckoning. We are not “Black and brown.” We are Black.

And that comes with a history no one else is carrying. We are the descendants of people who built this country, and fought for every right that others now benefit from.

And we will not be erased, again.

We scheduled to meet at a coffee shop at 3pm last Sunday. I didn't know it, but she said she lived almost an hour away, so I apologized and she said she'd still make it. I showed up and sat down, but she never showed. I wait for 15, 20, 30 minutes then said fuck it and got coffee, texted her pissed that she didn't even call or text, then left.

I got a text an hour later where she apologized and said that she got into an argument with her mom, lost track of time, and that I should go over. After that I told her that I was sorry but I didn't think it was going to work.

After a day or two of thinking ""what the hell 🤷‍♂️"" and thinking that maybe I was overreacting, I told her that I'd be willing to try again. We scheduled to meet today (Saturday), and all seemed well.

She said that she was going home to get ready and then she'd be there. I told her to let me know what time she was leaving because I didn't want to have a situation like last time where she didn't show up.

This woman had the NERVE to send me pictures of her in her towel and ask me to send her money to pay for her doordash order, when we literally were going to get food and drinks anyway. When I declined, it became evident to me that she didn't really want to go on a date and only wanted to use me. She said she wouldn't drive that whole way (which was equidistant from us) without eating and that she would have even invited me over. 

I doubt she would have showed up anyway.

It was a mystery book aimed at children that I'm pretty sure was scholastic as it had the Apple on it but I'm not positive. It had a detective team with 6 members and it was a series of cases where it would be a few paragraphs of the case then the answer.

The detective team was the main character who was the classic grizzled detective trope who had a K-9, then the tough guy (who im pretty sure was scared of snakes) and then a more nerdy member who was also a man. Then there was a girl who was the forensic scientist and one who wasn't shown often in the book but I think she handled tech stuff? Then there was the crime scene cleaner who was only seen a few times.

Some of the cases: The first one in the copy I had was a lawyer getting murdered by his assistant, which they found out by where the bullet entered from.

A guy was accidentally killed because a gaming shop switched the coffee in an attempt to calm him down because he always got rowdy, not knowing he orders it a certain way because he had a health issue I can't remember.

On Halloween the main character figured out who egged this woman's house because the kids had run through bushes to get away that had cat pee and he saw it under UV light.

I can probably list more cases if needed, but any help finding this book would really be appreciated! It might have been a series but I'm not sure.

MRI and ultrasound showed nothing else. I had a round of UDCA, rabeprazole and a diet that I admittedly didn't follow.

Since then I think the discomfort abated a bit, but it's still here and it's genuinely confusing me.

The pain is on the right side of my epigastrum, I can best describe it as how a sore muscle would feel. Discomfort but not explicit pain lasts for the entire day and it's tolerable except after either after I hadn't eaten anything for a while, or about an hour after I do eat when it gets really uncomfortable and sore to the touch (the stomach, that is). No nausea usually, and acid reflux stopped after a while. Lower bowels in tiptop shape.

Beyond the odd pain placement on the right side and symptoms, the triggers (or lack of them) are just confusing. Eggs, chicken fat and yoghurt hurt more than fried chicken cutlets or sriracha for example. Coffee only mildly kicks it off while alcohol SOOTHES it???? Physical activity, especially abdominal ones that leave my muscles sore around my stomach, also soothes the pain?

I plan on getting a H. pylori test done again, plus an ultrasound and eventually another endoscopy just to see what the hell is going on still.

I'm thankful that at least it's not explicit pain or nausea, but since it lasts for the entire day and gets worse after eating it's still getting in the way of living my life normally.
