I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iomjhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1iomjhs/lets_talk_about_our_favorite_lesbian_movies/,let's talk about our favorite lesbian movies!,"we keep seeing the same posts and everyone says they're bothered by it, so let's talk about our favorite lesbian movies for a minute. i'd like to talk about these over coffee with friends but unfortunately none of my irl friends watch lesbian movies, so...

my favorite is desert hearts (1985)! the film itself is amazing, but the story behind it is even more astonishing. it is the first lesbian movie to capture a lesbian relationship from a positive perspective. meaning no one dies or leaves the other for a man, which was the deal for many lesbian books and movies. the reason for that was simple tho. the producers/companies avoided positive perspectives on lesbians as to not ""pervert women"". anyway. the director donna deitch read the book desert of the heart (I'm currently reading it) and asked the writer jane rule for her permission to make it a movie. jane approved it only because she knew donna was gonna change the story (so far i didn't see many differences in the book lol).

they made the movie with a low budget, in 30 days. it was a small crew, they all stayed together in the middle of a desert. they didn't know if the movie was ever going to be shown on a screen, or even developed. background actors didn't know they were playing in a lesbian movie, the hotel owners that allowed them to film in didn't know it was a lesbian movie. they kept it secret, they worked real hard. and in the end... they made a great movie, they made queer history.

last week i made my best friend watch it. she said she didn't even realize how the time passed and the vibes of the movie were ""unmatched"". i strongly advice you to see it if you haven't.

Little did I know who I would get paired with‚Ä¶thankfully I wound up studying abroad my whole sophmore year and didn‚Äôt need the housing.  Email below with names/personal info redacted:

Good Afternoon Mr. *****
1) [Intro] I was recently notified of our appointment as future roommates. In brief summary, I am a Mechanical Engineering Major and an Air Force ROTC cadet. I am frequently busy with work, ROTC duties, and Engineering homework. I typically spend little time in my room,but when I am in my room I expect professional conduct.
2)[Warning] I chose a 24 hr quiet hours hall to evade unprofessional behavior. I do know know of your conduct and mannerisms, but I will politely let you know now; I will not tolerate disorderly behavior such as recreational substances, alcohol, and breaches of university policy or law. On the off chance you  conduct such activities, I recommend you apply to change your assignment at your earliest convenience. I also have an early military schedule starting 05:40 and ending at 22:00(lights out).
 3)[Personal Qualities] As for my personal aspects, I enjoying building and fixing things. I have a very serious personality, my life is focus on serving the Air Force and advancing my engineering skills. I enjoy listening to soft rock, country/pop and hard rock. If you've heard the Boston radio station, magic 106.7, that's most of my music. I may opt to play that station as background noise in the room with your kind permission. My sole redeeming quality is that I would be willing and able to repair any of your belongings or things around the room.
4)[Room Preferences] I have some preferences, they are of course my personal preference and not mandates. We can discuss formal terms at later date. I value efficiency above all, so my preferred layout reflects that quality. I would like to loft the beds together on the front left side of the room for resting. The front right side would be a living area, fitting with a T.v, coffee table and a couch. I can supply all but the T.v. The desk in the back would serve as the study area. All extra materials would be neatly placed under the bed or with in the closet areas.
5)[Conclusion] This is a lot to take in, and I apologize for seeming almost hostile, but I am a busy professional man.I may have sounded assertive, but all of these terms are just suggestions and preferences. I fully respect and recognize your rights and own preferences. I assure you, you will have a fair say in the matters. That being said if you find me too disagreeable or if you do participate in unprofessional practices, I do suggest a reassignment. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to contact me at *******@student.umass.edu, *****@gmail.com or (xxx)-xxx-xxx. I look forward to meeting you and our cordial cooperation as roommates.

I have been able to finally manifest a free coffee the other day after months of ‚Äútrying‚Äù. Sometimes I am so surprised by the universe and how manifesting works, but others I don‚Äôt understand what I am doing wrong.

A couple months ago for example I was manifesting to have the entire row to myself on my flight. Well it kinda worked. The middle seat was left empty, so I had a little more space, but still not the entire row.

This has happened quite frequently. I mean that I only got ‚Äúhalf‚Äù my desire.

Now the reason I write this post is because I am currently at an acting competition with my university. I was sure I was going to get into finals (there is preliminary rounds, semifinals and finals). I honestly didn‚Äôt have a doubt in my mind. Well yesterday we got the results of preliminary auditions and I did not get into semifinals. I am really bummed out and embarrassed. Maybe I was being too cocky or maybe I was too focused on it? But I don‚Äôt understand. Now I did a revision meditation last night and will continue affirming that I got into semifinals and we‚Äôll see if something changes‚Ä¶

1iomgz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1iomgz0/is_bayka_fpv3v108_the_best_french_press_coffee/,Is BAYKA FPV3V108 the best French press coffee maker for daily use? Read this review.,"As a coffee enthusiast who can't begin the day without the perfect brew, the BAYKA FPV3V108 French Press has been a delightful addition to my kitchen. Its sleek copper finish caught my eye immediately, blending seamlessly with my other countertop appliances. It‚Äôs not just about aesthetics though; this coffee maker brings a lot more to the table.

The first thing I noticed was its sturdy construction. Unlike some flimsy French presses I've tried in the past, this one feels solid in the hand, and the heat-resistant borosilicate glass has been a lifesaver for someone as clumsy as me. It‚Äôs survived a few light bumps on the counter, which is impressive for a glass coffee maker. Plus, the copper frame gives it a modern yet timeless charm that I genuinely appreciate.

Using the BAYKA French Press is straightforward. The 4-level filtration system is a standout feature, ensuring my coffee is sediment-free with every cup. I‚Äôm admittedly picky about coffee grounds sneaking into my morning brew, so this was a game-changer. Whether I‚Äôm preparing a strong espresso in the morning or a cold brew for a hot afternoon, this press handles it all. My partner even loves using it for tea, which makes it versatile for our household.

Cleaning, though, is where I had mixed feelings. While the plunger and filter are dishwasher-safe and easy to disassemble, I‚Äôve noticed water can sometimes get trapped in the metal frame surrounding the glass. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it does require a bit of extra attention during drying to avoid countertop drips.

[Check BAYKA FPV3V108 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-french-press-coffee-maker-bayka-fpv3v108-review-b087ptgx94/)

**Pros**

* **Elegant design**: The copper finish and glass combination make it visually appealing.
* **Durable materials**: Heat-resistant borosilicate glass and metal frame ensure longevity.
* **Efficient filtration**: The 4-level filtration system delivers clean, sediment-free coffee.
* **Multi-purpose use**: Perfect for coffee, tea, or even cold brews.
* **Portable and lightweight**: Ideal for camping or traveling.

**Cons**

* **Potential drips**: Water occasionally gets trapped in the frame, causing minor spills.
* **Glass fragility**: Despite being heat-resistant, glass inherently risks cracking over time.
* **Basic capacity**: The 34-ounce size may fall short for larger households or heavy coffee drinkers.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When stacked against other French presses like the Bodum Chambord or the Frieling Stainless Steel Press, the BAYKA FPV3V108 holds its ground. Its aesthetic appeal surpasses the utilitarian look of the Frieling press, making it a lovely countertop addition. However, the Frieling model, being entirely made of stainless steel, offers better durability over time.

The Bodum Chambord excels in simplicity and affordability but lacks the sturdy build and premium feel of the BAYKA French Press. If you‚Äôre searching for a balance between style, functionality, and price, the BAYKA strikes that middle ground. However, if you desire something futuristic and indestructible, the Frieling might be worth the extra investment.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Given its robust build, the BAYKA FPV3V108 offers excellent value for its price point. While it may not be the cheapest option out there, the combination of aesthetic appeal and practical features justifies the cost. For someone transitioning from plastic or cheaper French presses, this model feels like a significant upgrade. It‚Äôs also a great gift idea for coffee lovers who appreciate both form and function in their kitchen tools.

The reusable filter is a bonus, saving money and reducing waste compared to coffee machines with disposable filters or pods. Its manual operation means no extra costs for electricity or maintenance, another win for budget-conscious users.

I 28(F) is an only child who used to live in the city after graduating from college and started working in several corporate companies. 

Tatay ko (sana hindi nalang), 54 ay nakaasa lang sakin simula nung nagtrabaho ako. Simula pagkabata ko masasabi ko naman na may mga good memories ako with him but that doesn't change the fact na he's an AH. Growing up, chaotic ang  childhood ko. I have half siblings sa side ng mom ko and around 7-8 years old ako nung nahanap nila si mama and lived with us. We were okay, not until years passed by and laging nag-aaway sina mama at papa. My sibs were teens during those times pala in their 15s-20s. 

Nasaksihan ko pano murahin ng tatay ko ang mga kuya ko na para bang sya ang nagpapalamon samin, when in fact asa lang din sya sa kita ng mama ko. Palamunin din sya kagaya namin. Sinasabihan nyang tamad ang mga kapatid ko pero sya ang numero unong tamad. Mga ate at kuya ko ang laging naghuhugas ng mga pinaglutuan at pinagkainan. Naglilinis ng paligid naglilinis ng bahay. Tatay ko? Hilata all day. Bisyo at sugarol pa. Tapos pag hindi nabigyan ng mama, mumurahin si mama mula ulo hanggang paa. Ambag nya? Tagaluto. Dapat lang. 

Ilang beses nyang pinalayas ang mga kapatid ko sa walang kwentang dahilan. Mga palamunin daw. Ang totoo nyang gusto nyang solohin lang ang kakarampot na kinikita ng nanay ko non. Pero my mom was an amazing woman. Nakaya nya kaming buhayin living a comfortable like kahit 3 kaming nag-aaral non ng ate at kuya ko, elem, hs at college. Then 9 katao kami dito sa bahay. 

Growing up din, elementary and high school ilang beses kaming pinalayas ng magaling kong tatay dito sa bahay namin. Dahilan? Hindi daw nakikinig ang mama ko sa kanya na palayasin ang mga kapatid ko. My mom was perfect and a supermom. Wala akong masamang masasabi sa kanya. Gago lang ang tatay ko kasi selfish at narcissist sya. 

Ff. College freshman ako when my mom died because of cancer. Gumuho mundo ko non haha. Depressed. 9 years ago na pero the pain is still here. I graduated college sa tulong ng mga lolo at lola ko pati ng tito ko. Parents at Kapatid ng tatay ko. Yes, iniasa nya ko sa kanila dahil wala syang kakayahan. Wala syang trabaho. 


Thankfully, nakahanap agad ako ng trabaho sa city. I stayed there. That's the only time I felt free. And simula ng kalbaryo ko. Sakin nalipat ang lahat ng responsibilidad. Malakas pa sa kalabaw ang tatay ko. Ayaw nya lang magtrabaho dahil nakaasa sya buong buhay nya sa mga tao sa paligid nya. 

My salary is not that high, sakto lang. Nagbabayad akong rent sa city and pagkain ko pa. Other bills and such. 
Minsan delay ang sahod. Kapag ganon, abot abot ang mura na nakukuha ko sa tatay ko dahil wala pa kong maipadala. Hindi masyadong malaki napapadala ko, pero alam kong tama lang yon to buy his needs and necessities. 

Cycle went on, palala ng palala. I'm now the breadwinner I never wished to be. 

Last October he had a back surgery. My partner and I had to stay with him dahil hindi daw pwede ang live in partner.btw, inintay muna nilang lumala yung sugat sa likod bago nadala sa ospital. Hinahayaan lang sya dito sa bahay, he refused my tito's offer to bring him to the doctor and such. Until my kuya checked on him and told me he has boil sa likod. It got infected. I never wanted to see him. But out of awa, I asked my partner to see him to check if it's true ganon. Then tumawag sya sakin to show how terrible my dad's back looks like. Boil was infected. Madaming nana, namamaga and he's like kuba na. My partner did not hesitate to bring him to the nearest hospital. He was confined and underwent a back surgery. Open wound. Sabi ng doctor if di pa nadala aabot na sa buto ng spinal nya yung nana. Mas mahirap. 

After few days nakalabas na sya, ako nagbabantay sa kanya non. I needed to file leaves sa work kase walang magbabantay sa kanya. Sa bahay, akin lahat. After a week of travelling from province to city everyday, I feel like pabagsak na ang katawan ko. I only sleep for 1-3hrs everyday. Hindi bedridden ang tatay ko. Tamad lang. I gave him that time to recover kaya I endured lahat ng pagod. 

That same week, I asked my partner if pwede nya ako masamahan pansamantala dito sa bahay just to make sure someone would look after sa tatay ko while I'm at work. He even offered it too though before I even asked. Alam nya pagod ko and all. Oks naman nung una. May mga moodswings tatay ko na hindi lang mabili ang gustong ulam di na kami kakausapin, laging galit. Bababuyin ang bahay  itatambak ang hugasin. Lahat ng bawal na pagkain yun ang gusto. Ofc aalma ko, naggagamot sya e. 

We work nigh shift, full time ako and part time si partner. 3-4hrs per night sya.  Sobrang draining neto. After a month naospital at naconfine ulit sya. Acute gastritis. Hindi maawat sa kape at yosi e. Partner ko ulit nagsugod sa kanya sa ospital nasa byahe nako non patrabaho. I needed to stop midway to go back. All 3 days he was in the hospital magkaaway kami. Second night na nandon sya, his live in partner came. So I left and told them hindi nako magbabantay. Bibilhin ko lang mga gamot na kailangan at kukunin mga panglinis ng sugat nya, ihahatid don at uuwi nako. Galit na galit sya sakin at sa nurses for not letting him eat. NPO kase kailangan kunan ng dugo at i-ultrasound. So bawal food. Inaway nya nurses pati ako. Nagsagutan kami. Since that day, naipon na naman ng naipon lahat ng galit ko. He even told my tito na hindi sya dinadalhan ng pagkain don. Sinungaling talaga haha. 

Nagdadabog ako all throughout whenever I enter or leave his room. Gusto kong maramdaman nya na galit na galit ako. Nung ilalabas na sya, tinggalan ng swero. Lumabas ng kwarto kasi mainit daw. Ghorl, may AC don. Ayaw nyang ipasara ang pinto kaya umiinit sa loob. Niradyo sya ng guards. Live in partner nya takot sa kanya. üòè 

I stopped talking to him. Nung ibinababa na sya ng wheelchair for discharge, iniwan ko sila. I waited sa lobby kasama partner ko. Nung dumating yung service iniwan ko din sila. Nagcommute kami ng boyfriend ko. Pero dala namin yung mga gamit. 

Things got worse, recently we had a heated argument and pinapalayas nya na kami ng partner ko. For context, we covered all expenses here. Some things got compromised. Our rents were behind and all. Naubos pati savings namin. I got severely depressed and I needed to quit my job. Almost 1 month na din na wala akong trabaho but I still provide may natira pa naman. 

Now he hates us for sleeping in the morning. Perwisyo daw kami at malas all because he wakes up early only to drink his coffee then hihilata na buong araw. While us? Work at night. 

Nilock nya yung gas tank, tinago mga lutuan. Nagkasagutan kami. I told him na napakasama ng ugali nya. This all rooted from all the anger I burried inside me. Unspoken shts. And he answered back saying ako ang masama ang ugali na PI ko and animal ako. I just told him  aalis kami once we have the money and I even said pasensya na dahil di pa kami makaalis. Pero di kami magiging pabigat. Never naman talaga kami naging pabigat sa totoo lang sya ang perwisyo e . All he knows is maghintay ng biyaya haha. 

I left one day for an interview. My boyfriend said nawalan ng kuryente. When he said that, alam ko na kagad na pinatay yon ng magaling kong ama sa main switch. Hindi ako makafocus non. I was too worried because my partner has athma and buti hindi masyado mainit that day. After interview umuwi kagad ako. Kuryente is back. Dumating kasi live in partner nya. 

Wala na kaming kibuan dito sa bahay. Suklam na suklam ako. Kung may pera lang kaming pangrent nakaalis na kami agad. But for now kailangan namin magtiis. 

I can't go to work because I'm worried about sa pwede nyang gawin sa partner ko pag wala ako. He may not hurt my partner physically pero his mouth is too evil like him at baka hindi na sya mapagtimpian neto. I'm praying na sana makaalis na kami asap.

It's to the point I will watch it voluntarily and even stay up to watch resolutions to cliffhangers. I give the show 10/10 even when some of the storylines are absurd (Sheryl Crow coincidentally showing up at the coffee shop comes to mind.)

That being said, why does Chad Michael Murray squint so much? I pointed it out to my fiancee who said she never noticed it until I said anything. Is it a Chad thing or a tick that Lucas has? Is it something that guys did in the early 2000s to try and look hot?

I make the same face when I'm trying to read small print and don't have my glasses on me.

1iomcau,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1iomcau/50_days_clean_advice_for_quitting_nicotine/,50 Days Clean! | Advice for Quitting Nicotine,"(22M) I‚Äôm officially 53 days clean today! Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to make it this far without nicotine pouches.

Here‚Äôs Some Advice for Anyone Looking to Quit Nicotine:

1. Remember Why You‚Äôre Quitting 

For me, I decided to quit because the pouches were causing throat problems, anxiety, and high blood pressure. I had my right tonsil swell up and I believe part of it was due to the irritating presence of nicotine. 

The swelling has since gone down so I‚Äôm not too worried about it now. I thought I had cancer at one point. I plan to visit a doctor just to make sure. 

I‚Äôm also less stressed and anxious. You don‚Äôt realize how bad the anxiety is until you quit. 

2. Substitute Nicotine with Caffeine 

Recently, I‚Äôve been consuming more caffeine to help with my Nicotine cravings. I actually bought some caffeine gum today at Walmart. I believe it‚Äôs okay to substitute one stimulant with another if that stimulate is better for your overall health.

Caffeine has been proven to be better for your health than nicotine. Coffee and Tea both have antioxidant effects on the body. Nicotine has only been shown to be beneficial cognitively where Caffeine is beneficial both cognitively and physically. 

3. Be Patient with Yourself 

You have to realize that nicotine is one of the most addicting chemicals on planet earth. Of course it‚Äôs going to be difficult to quit. Your brain is still getting used to the drastic absence of dopamine caused by nicotine. 

Realize that you may experience brain fog or feel lazy even months after quitting. That‚Äôs okay. You are rewiring your dopamine reward system to no longer rely on such a potent external stimuli for dopamine. 

Eventually, your dopamine receptors will reset and you‚Äôll be able to feel motivated again. It just takes time.

1iombjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1iombjk/i_feel_like_my_life_has_been_turned_upside_down/,I feel like my life has been turned upside down,"OK- long story here, but after finding this page, I feel like I finally have hope after my life being turned upside down possibly by R-CPD. I read on here about R-CPD being a spectrum, and I am almost 99% sure I have it- I just want to see if anyone else has experienced this god forsaken condition like I have. 

I have had gurgling in my throat since I can remember, which started around middle school (I am currently 22 completing a rigorous in-person masters program- this is important later on). Such a painful, awkward time in anyones life, but then on top of that, I had this loud gurgling in my throat that no one knew what in the world it was coming from. Thankfully, all I had was gurgling and a tough time burping when the gurgling happened, but I was always still able to regularly burp from time to time. As I progressed through middle school, high school, and my college undergrad, I noticed that the gurgling usually happened when I drank coffee, protein shakes, and was nervous (which is almost all the time!). Fast forward to 12/26/24, I am now getting random nausea, hot flashes, and the worst acid reflux. At first, I thought I was pregnant and was already planning in my head how much school I would need to take off to have a baby. Once pregnancy was ruled out by my regular occuring cycles (thank god!), I was at lost for what was causing me to randomly be nauseous and this uptick in acid reflux. I started eating smaller meals to help with the acid reflux and nausea...and then I was fine after a couple of weeks and started up my regular (not so good for you) diet and eating however much I want with no acid reflux/nausea consequences. I still had my gurgles of course, but it didn't make anything worse. Now, last week (2/6/25), I just started to get these awful waves of nausea again while I was working with clients (apart of the masters program) and thought I was literally going to throw up. I went home early thinking I had gotten the stomach bug. Of course, I was fine after I laid down and came to the conclusion the acid reflux/nausea/hot flashes were back. Now, I live my life at school and seeing clients carrying a plastic bag in my pocket in fear I am randomly going to get nauseated and throw up, all the while I have this acid sitting at the base of my throat making me feel more sick and eliminating any trace of appetite I have. Getting food down has been the hardest part of all of this. I also noticed that the only time I am fine is in the mornings when I regularly workout, and don't experience any of these symptoms. This is the safest part of the day for me- but I feel that maybe it is mostly psychological. 

So, I am really wondering if anyone has ever experienced these symptoms randomly coming on as apart of R-CPD? Especially, having the gurgles all your life (and being FINE!) and then getting hit with this nausea/acid reflux/hot flashes crap. I have a classmate in my program (small world) that had all of these problems and got the botox injection- which has changed her life. She doesn't even think about acid reflux/nausea/or the gurgles anymore. This is how I have been lead into the R-CPD world. I have an appointment in April to get all of this checked out, but I am curious if any of your lives have been turned upside down in this way too. Anything helps.

1iom8t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iom8t7/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriends_sister_to_stop/,AITA for asking my boyfriend's sister to stop cooking pork?,"Two months ago, my boyfriend's sister (19F) broke up with her boyfriend and had to move out of his apartment, so my boyfriend (26M) and I (27NB) offered to let her move in with us. When she moved in, I asked her to clean up after herself if she cooked meat, as neither my boyfriend nor I eat meat, and not to cook anything with shellfish, as I have a severe shellfish allergy. She said that was fine and she would make sure to do it.

She has not been cleaning up after herself in the kitchen, and almost every day I have to clean congealed animal fat off  pans and dishes that she has left out overnight. I don't mind doing her dishes when I'm already washing mine and my boyfriend's, but I really hate having to clean out animal fat and bits of meat from all my cookware. I have asked her several times to remember to clean up after herself, and she always says she will but never does. 

I'm also Jewish, and although I'm not religious, it's still important to me to follow my cultural practices. Having pork in the kitchen makes me uncomfortable generally, as you are not supposed to share any cooking surfaces or utensils between kosher and non-kosher foods; but having to clean it up myself makes me feel dirty in a way that I can't fully explain. When I woke up yesterday, she had left sausages wrapped in foil on top of the coffee machine and it had dripped juice (?) down into the machine. I was really mad, so I told her to stop cooking pork until she was ready to clean up after herself. I was going to ask her to stop cooking meat altogether, but it felt too harsh when I'm already imposing restrictions due to my allergy.

She said I was being unfair, since she doesn't ask me not to cook things she doesn't like. I replied that if I was cooking in her kitchen and she was doing all my dishes for me, she'd be within her rights to ask me not to keep cooking something that she hated cleaning, and that it's not even about me not liking pork, it's a religious obligation not to contaminate my food with it. She started crying, saying that I must think her food is gross or dirty if it will 'contaminate' mine. I tried to apologize, as I didn't mean to insult her food, but my boyfriend interrupted to tell me to stop bothering her about it. He said it doesn't matter whether there's pork in the kitchen, and it's not a religious obligation since I don't believe in G-d.

His sister left, saying she was going to stay with a friend where she wasn't being contantly policed, and my boyfriend is now really mad at me for 'expecting her to organize her life around my demands' because she has already accommodated me enough with my allergy. I really don't want to be controlling or demanding, and I feel like I've been too harsh, but I also feel really uncomfortable with having to ignore something so important to me.

1iom6bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Easysidehustlebiz/comments/1iom6bc/amazing_opportunity_to_earn_passive_income/,AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO EARN PASSIVE INCOME!! üåüüí∞,"It‚Äôs so simple, even my 14-year-old is doing it with me! üî•

üö® Imagine 20-30 MILLION people joining this revolutionary business model soon. üò± No other company in history has grown like this ‚Äì EVER! Amazon took two years to reach 1 million members... we hit that in just 13 months! üöÄ

For only ¬£7.50 / $9.95 a month, and with no selling or product pushing required, this is your chance to jump on board! All you need to do is get started, and we‚Äôre about to turn on the funnels. Guess where those millions of new members could end up?  Under you! üò±üî•

Important: This is **not** a get-rich-quick scheme. I had to attend two Zoom calls, then four more after that, before it clicked. But if you focus and give it time, by this time next year, the results can be very rewarding.

Here‚Äôs how it works:
- I signed up myself, my daughter, and my mom as affiliates, so it cost $150 upfront. But, because I signed my daughter and my mom under me, I got $50 back the following week. For every affiliate you sign up, you receive $25 back ‚Äì it‚Äôs as simple as that.
- After that, it‚Äôs just ¬£7.50 / $9.95 per month, per person, to hold your place in the matrix.
- As your matrix grows, you earn 0.25 per person, per month. With 8,000 people in your matrix, you‚Äôre looking at $4,000 a month in passive income once your matrix is full. 

Even if you choose not to rank up (those who haven‚Äôt signed up two more people to reach bronze status), with 8,000 sign-ups, they would still earn **$2,000 each month**!

The beauty is, it‚Äôs a **forced matrix**. If I, my daughter, or my mom sign someone up, they automatically fall into the next available spot in the matrix!

Plus, the earning potential doesn‚Äôt stop there! üò≥üò≥üò≥

Weekly Fast Start Commissions 
are paid out on the first month‚Äôs membership and the $40 affiliate sign-up fee. This means you'll earn $5 for any new member you refer, and $20 for any new affiliates. Since most people join as both a member and affiliate, that‚Äôs a $25 payout the following week!

THE BEST PART üíÉüèºüíÉüèºüíÉüèºüíÉüèºüíÉüèºüíÉüèºüò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
Matching Bonuses: Here‚Äôs where it gets even better. Imagine you‚Äôve personally enrolled 10 people, each earning $6,000 per month from their matrix. You‚Äôll match 50% of their matrix earnings, meaning you‚Äôll get a $3,000 bonus per person, totaling $30,000 per month from just those 10 people! üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥And that‚Äôs just the beginning‚Äîyou can earn matching bonuses from hundreds or even thousands of other people across different generations. If you're a Platinum you‚Äôll also match Gold and Silver Generation earnings, increasing your income even further!

Matrix Commissions and Matching Bonuses are paid out the first week of each month for the previous month‚Äôs volume, starting from your second month. All initial orders are paid out in Fast Start Commissions.

Plus, all products are available at **cost price** for members, with no pressure to buy or sell. You also get a retail link, so if someone purchases through it, you earn commissions. And for those who do want to refer, referral commissions are paid a week in arrears -no waiting around!

One lady‚Äôs matrix filled in 18 months, and without even reaching bronze, she‚Äôs earning $2,000 a month in regular income. 

It‚Äôs easy to start!!!

The time to act is now! A big ad campaign is about to launch, with an estimated 30 million new sign-ups. Whether you join now or later, those people could fall into your matrix, so why not get ahead of the wave? üåä

Don‚Äôt look back in regret ‚Äì this is the #1 home-based business in the world, and you‚Äôre being offered the chance to get in now. For the cost of just two coffees or a bottle of wine a month, you could start building a future that earns you passive income for life.

Once you see it, can‚Äôt un see it!! 

Stop waiting ‚Äì COMMENT to this post, and see for yourself how easy it is! ‚úâÔ∏è

I used to like Gucci guilty, but now it smells too stuffy. Right now I still like kensie zest for life (citrus I believe), but I am looking for more staying power and a variety. What are some good sample packs I can try?

So far this is what I know about my likes/dislikes.

Dislikes:
Vanilla -(I knowwwww:( - I like real vanilla, but the perfume versions have always been too sweet)
Coconut 
Rose
Overpowering cashmere scent
Laundry clean smells? Think linen and sky febreeze scents-I mean no offense  
Anything smelling like a pastry or icing
 Most highly floral perfumes

Likes:
Citrus including things like bergamot
Apple
Watermelon (most fruits)
Coffee
Cinnamon undertones(not main event)
Chocolate(just not the sweet pastry kind)
Lavender hints ok
Maybe aquamarine?
Open to slightly woody/spicy- but not old spice level

I'm glad Seinfeld did that [Comedian](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005JLW5/?tag=jamesaltuc-20) movie to call attention to it, then things like [Talking Funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKY6BGcx37k&ab_channel=KenJones) and [Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee](https://www.netflix.com/title/80171362). Know of any good other meta- things like that? That talk about the craft of standup or good comedy writing? Comedy is like pop philosophy to me. So I want to study it even more.

Those are indeed a good start. I sent him this list of my other top picks re: the craft of standup:

Okay, so I have to start this off by saying I know I‚Äôm not the greatest person. In this situation I made so many mistakes, but it just got to the point where I felt compelled to do what I thought was the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. Well, if it was the right thing.

So for context, about two years ago me(33M) and my wife (29F) let‚Äôs call her Mae moved to a new place knowing minimal people after being together and constantly moving for work for the past 5-6 years. When we moved we both created friendships, and the relationship strained.
We had always fought and had bad fights before we moved, but these turned into knock down, drag out, looking at the other person with hate in your eyes kinda fights. We always just kinda let them pass, but they would continually happen and got worse. We never really talked about them, or about getting help, even though we had gotten couples therapy in the past. It is important to note, we did get married because we knew at that moment in our lives it would give us significantly more income and her benefits. That being said, there were true feeling and love that were shared and had while together, and there was a point where I believe we both loved each other in a healthy way.

Fast forward to both of us living here for about 6 months, we had gotten a sort of friend group of people we had met here and seemed to really enjoy us. Expect for the fact that everyone enjoyed us kind of‚Ä¶separately? The problem was whenever the whole group would get together and try to do something fun, we would always almost ruin/make things weird because there would always be something was was making us fight / causing tension. And most times is was the smallest, dumbest things. And I know I was a part of that. We both have ALOT of very long, very serious conversations where we both agree that maybe us being together isn‚Äôt for the best. Since we were stuck in the same place since we had moved, she sought out a place to rent with a couple from the friend group that was getting a new, bigger place and I ended up getting a place with a buddy of mine from the same friend group. I tried to make the split as amicable as possible (because we have had two dogs for about 5 years) but I understand that these things are incredibly difficult, so I just offered her access to the dogs and that I did want to be friends, if possible (I know, I know, I‚Äôm a frickin idiot).

She moves out, no contact. Doesn‚Äôt want to see the dogs, doesn‚Äôt want any contact, and hey I get it. It‚Äôs still a little awkward because we work together, but I‚Äôm cordial when in the same space and when she ignored me I obliged and just moved on. Again, I get how rough this thing is. This all happens for about 4 months or so, and the friend group all decides that they are going to a huge music festival for about a week. Now, I figured that both of us going would possibly be a huge distraction for the entire group and this thing wasn‚Äôt cheap, so I talked to the friend who was organizing it and she agreed it might be the best thing for the entire group of I stayed behind. No drama, and everyone can focus on actually having a good time. I completely agreed, and hey, I could stay home and use the extra money.

Here‚Äôs where I fucked up. Another member of that friend group (28F) let‚Äôs call her Amy, had a dog and she was going to be gone more than anyone else because she had an add on trip to see family after the festival‚Ä¶Now I have two dogs, a huge yard, and am a single guy in a new place so I have a lot of time on my hands. So we talk, and I offer to watch her dog for the two weeks she gone. Now I have to be honest. I didn‚Äôt just look at Amy and see an androgynous blob. She was very kind and sweet, and every interaction we had ever had was small (how could we have any big meaningful interactions with the dynamics the group had) but I always enjoyed her take or opinions on things when I got to here them. So was I trying to be a good guy? Yeah, of course. But I can‚Äôt lie and say that I didn‚Äôt look at Amy and just see a friend. The friend group basically went no contact with me after the split with Mae, with the exception being the friend I moved in with, and Amy. And when my grandpa died, she was literally the only person that was there for me. 

So I watch her dog for two weeks. The first week goes by, the rest of the friend group comes home, and all is the same. No communication, no really hanging out unless we see each other at work. And hey, like I said I get it. I knew that they were probably being there for Mae, and I had my dogs. And I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I missed them. But sometimes friends have to choose a side right? And sometimes it‚Äôs just not yours. I know it was a hard/impossible situation I put them in.

But Amy stays gone because she went to visit family after the festival, and we start talking. Every. Day. First it‚Äôs how‚Äôs her pup doing, then it‚Äôs how the festival went, to just calling and talking about our days or what we were up to. It got a little outta hand fast, maybe I‚Äôll leave that up for you to decide. But by the time she was supposed to come home, we were video chatting multiple times a day and texting a bunch. And I can‚Äôt lie, I fell in love with her dog over the two weeks I had him. I really believe you can see its owner in a dog, and her dog was so good, got along so great with both of my dogs, and was just so easy going and had suuuch a funny personality. And just for frame of reference, this dog is like the dog from sandlot big. A huge, furry, sweet monster

Soooo anyways she comes home and I‚Äôm excited. Like stupid excited, more so than I think I‚Äôd been in years. She picked him up and the feeling was mutual. We went on dates, we hung out with her gma. When I had time off I would bring her coffee and food to work, and she would give me these little things like candles and soap she made from scratch, with I thought was so incredibly talented and cool. But there was a catch. We couldn‚Äôt go out in town, because what if someone saw and told our friends. We couldn‚Äôt be plain and open with what was going on, because she didn‚Äôt want to mess with our group of friends. Even when she would stay the night with me, we would have to leave crazy early and take a back road because the friends lived in the same neighborhood and she didn‚Äôt want to run into them.

And lemme tell you, it SUCKED. I hated sneaking when my feelings were that strong, hiding something that I honestly didn‚Äôt understand being an end of the world thing. Which, in hindsight, was selfish on my end. Yeah, maybe I wasn‚Äôt hanging out with or around the friend group, so it wouldn‚Äôt have really affected me. But she was, so it was very much more messy for her. But despite that, I asked her to be my girlfriend, and to be exclusive. This all happened over the course of maybe 3-4 months. And then we had a talk. She had finally told her best friend, also a member of the group. And well, while the girl didn‚Äôt see it as a good match, she told her it was wayyy too soon and I guess it just wasn‚Äôt the right time. So she talked with me, and told me how much I meant to her, that she didn‚Äôt want to lose me in her life, that we just had to wait for the timing. And honestly, I cried a little bit. I really liked this girl, ya know? We held each other, and I left shortly after. But everything continued on the same way after. We still texted, hung out, stayed the night and slept together. And I thought that I could wait, because this was a relationship where I was 100% myself, and she said she was too. We told each other constantly how much we felt for each other and how we were each other‚Äôs ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù. And honestly, for me it was love. I never said it, probably more so because of my hang ups about being hurt, but I thought I showed it in every way possible. And I dunno, in my mind I guess when we were able to be official and a thing, then saying something like that would make the waiting all the more worth it.

Anyways, all great and everything and then my ex, Mae, approaches me at work. Which wasn‚Äôt too alarming, to be honest it was nice talking to someone that knew me for so long. I would say I had felt any emotions when we talked, but there I guess is a certain level of comfort there. She asked about my grandma, how I was doing and that she felt bad that she hadn‚Äôt reached out to her after my grandpa had died. I told her that I was going to be with my grandma later in the week, and if she wanted to see her without it being too awkward that would be a good time for it because they wouldn‚Äôt be alone. So fast forward to later in the week, and she comes with us to eat and everything. Well, my grandma leaves early because she wants to feed her animals, and we stay and are drinking. Yeah, that‚Äôs right. You can see the multi car collision already from here right? Well, I get blackout, but I know I make it home okay because I wake up in my bed. Alone, no signs of any funny business, and I even had a text from her saying she was glad that she got to see my grandma. So that‚Äôs that, right? Nahhhhh.

Later that day I‚Äôm talking to Amy, as usual, when I get a text from her. ‚ÄúYou told her about us?‚Äù. And I just start freaking out. I don‚Äôt remember anything, I had chalked getting blackout to being in an ex with that setting. So I start talking to my roommate, because he‚Äôs getting all the details immediately. Apparently Mae told his sister, who coincidentally is the girl who planned the festival trip. So I‚Äôm getting all this info piece by piece from him, because I‚Äôm being ignored by everyone. And it comes out that yeah, I told her while I was blackout. Apparently that night when I got blackout she/me/fucking whoever started kissing the other, and then my dumb blackout ass pulled away and then broke down because of ‚Äúbeing in love with Amy‚Äù and that ‚Äú I cared for her so fucking much‚Äù and that ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt want to lie anymore‚Äù. Yeah, I said that, and I more to dig the hole deeper. And it makes sense. As soon as I heard it, I knew I said it. It was something that I had been thinking about for weeks. 

So the next day, Amy has the grace to allow me to see her and talk. And I tell her. I tell her that I don‚Äôt remember, but it had to be me. I tell her how much I care about her, about what I said is real, about how I want her in my life in whatever capacity, regardless of the romantic portion because she means that much to me. And I meant it. She thanked me, said that maybe it just needed more time and if it was meant to be that it would happen. Said that it sucked because she thought it was getting to the point where we could‚Äôve gone public.It was more than I deserved, and I still felt that closeness and that she cared. But I know I hurt her by doing what I did, and trust can be like a ceramic glass. Impossible to put together once broken. 

But the next couple times we hang out, she‚Äôs upset. She tells me how hurt she is, and how betrayed, and I completely understand. I listen and I apologize, and try to communicate my emotions and show/tell her that I will do anything to regain that trust/show her this one thing is not indicative of who I am. And we still spend the night with each other, and wake up next to each other‚Ä¶.so idk, I guess I thought it was a part of the healing process, and that thought that it was just a part of all the work I knew I had to do to make it up to her.

And then she tells me she went on a date with another guy. That he was sweet. But we are still seeing each other, spending the night, texting constantly. And then one night I‚Äôm over at her place, and we are cuddled up on her couch with her head against my chest‚Ä¶and it just felt‚Ä¶right. But then she says something about this new guy, let‚Äôs call him James. Don‚Äôt know anything about him really. But she says she‚Äôs been starting to like him. And have feelings for him. And that hurts. Hurts a lot. So I ask her‚Ä¶well if you like this guys like that‚Ä¶would he be happy knowing we were here like this? And look, yeah I shouldn‚Äôt have said it. But we had been drinking, and as soon as she said it all I could think of is her with him like that, which obviously hurt. So it wasn‚Äôt right to do something that could make someone else feel the way I was feeling in the moment. Anyways, that just wasn‚Äôt what was supposed to be said in that moment. I don‚Äôt really know how to end this other than now I‚Äôm just sitting here, alone. And I feel like my minds been through a whirlwind. But I know I  did this to myself. And part of me wishes I had never said a thing, that we could just go back to our secret whatever. But then I think of how lighter I felt when I realized I didn‚Äôt have to pretend anymore, after all the initial chaos happened. Anyways, I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to, and this has been eating me up inside. If you took the time, thank you so much and I‚Äôm sorry for the world‚Äôs longest rant.",1,1739461180.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I have been battling with symptoms for a long time. It is not only frustrating but disheartening.

I know we are talking about the nervous system when it comes to dysautonomia and that includes the vagus nerve which also includes the adrenals.

I was told by my functional neurologist that my adrenals need help‚Äîespecially after a crash I had 1.5 months ago after drinking a decaf that ended up being regular coffee or with a very high concentration of caffeine. One of the worst days but one that gave me a clue about my adrenals. 

The thing is that I have not felt as well since, every single day has been a struggle BUT on the positive side of things, I have felt moments or pure bliss here and there and even in the mornings which were always the toughest for me‚Äîhigher cortisol/adrenaline?

I also took an adrenal supplement recently that wiped me on the first try and that is probably another clue of my adrenals needing help.

I do not drink, I eat low carb, caffeine is gone but sometimes I crave a decaf (not sure this should be a NO NO), I prioritize sleep, and take my life slowly even though it is impossible not to stress out about things as there always seems to be something going on.

My wife Roxi was recently diagnosed with a hiatal hernia after years of battling chronic gastritis and acid reflux. This sent me down a rabbit hole of intense research, uncovering the science behind digestive health and natural solutions for long-term relief.

While the causes of gastric distress vary‚Äîfrom H. pylori infections and medication overuse to structural issues‚Äîthere is a universal toolkit of strategies that can help heal the digestive tract. Here's some of what I uncovered during my research regarding how to contend with this painful condition.

**Understanding and Managing GERD: A Practical Approach**

If you struggle with acid reflux, you likely already know how simple changes in your daily routine can make a huge difference. While medications have their place, diet and lifestyle play a significant role in symptom management. Let's break it down:

**The ""Maybe Don't Eat That"" List:**

* Chocolate üç´ (Sorry, but it's a trigger!)
* Alcohol üç∑ (That evening glass of wine might not be helping)
* Coffee ‚òï (I know, I know...)
* Fried and fatty foods üçü
* Acidic foods üçä (Citrus, tomatoes‚Äîyes, that means pizza too)

**Small Lifestyle Tweaks with Big Impact:**

* *Weight Management:* Losing even a few pounds can significantly reduce reflux episodes.
* *Smoking Cessation:* Mixed evidence short-term, but long-term, it's beneficial.
* *Sleep Position:* Raising the head of your bed by 11 inches reduces both the frequency and duration of reflux episodes.

üåø **Nature's Medicine Cabinet: Herbal Allies for Digestive Healing**

Living with acid reflux can make even simple activities uncomfortable, but nature offers some powerful, research-backed solutions.

**The Soothers:**

* Marshmallow Root *(Althaea officinalis)* ‚Äì Forms a protective mucilage over the stomach lining.
* Slippery Elm *(Ulmus fulva)* ‚Äì A natural gut bandaid.

ü¶† **The H. Pylori Battle Plan: Natural Solutions with Scientific Backing**

H. pylori is a bacterial master of survival, capable of thriving in our stomach's hostile, acidic environment. This troublemaker can lead to reflux, ulcers, and even gastric cancer. Luckily, research supports several natural interventions:

**Green Tea: Research demonstrates impressive results:**

* Inhibits H. pylori growth at concentrations of 0.25-0.5% (Yee & Koo, 2000)
* Blocks urease activity (Matsubara et al, 2003)
* Prevents bacterial adhesion to mucosal cells (Lee et al, 2009)
* High consumption correlates with less than half the infection rate (40% vs. 83%) (Yee et al, 2002)

**Black Seed (Nigella sativa): A randomized study with 88 participants revealed:**

* Triple therapy: 83% eradication
* Omeprazole + 1g Black Seed: 48% eradication
* Omeprazole + 2g Black Seed: 67% eradication
* Omeprazole + 3g Black Seed: 48% eradication All groups showed significant symptom improvement (Salem et al, 2010).

**Broccoli Sprouts: Studies show remarkable results:**

* 78% tested negative by Day 8 (7 of 9 patients)
* 67% remained negative by Day 35
* 44% eradication rate confirmed by breath testing (Galan et al, 2004)

Sulforaphane, the key compound, significantly reduced both H. pylori colonization and associated gastritis when consuming 70g fresh sprouts daily for eight weeks (Yanaka et al, 2009)

**Mastic Gum: Clinical trials demonstrate:**

* 350mg three times daily: 31% eradication
* 1000mg three times daily: 39% eradication, compared to triple therapy's 77% (Dabos et al, 2010)

**Cranberry Research: Laboratory studies show cranberries:**

* Force H. pylori into dormancy
* Inhibit attachment to gastric cells (Shumely et al, 2004)
* Demonstrate dose-dependent growth inhibition (Matsushima et al, 2008)

Key clinical trials:

* 189 participants: 14.4% became H. pylori negative with cranberry juice vs 5.4% with placebo (Zhang et al, 2005)
* Study of 295 children: 23% eradication with cranberry juice + probiotics (Gotteland et al, 2008)

**Dark Grapes and Berries: Effectiveness varies by type:**

* Strongest (>90% eradication at 1% concentration): elderberries, bilberries, blueberries, cranberries
* Moderate effect: strawberries, raspberries (Brown et al, 2008)

**Mucolytic Support: N-acetyl cysteine (NAC):**

* Reduces gastric mucus thickness by \~75%
* Improves antibiotic success from 41% to 71% (Zala et al, 1994; Gurbuz et al, 2005)

**Probiotic Support: Specific strains show promise:**

* *Lactobacillus acidophilus NAS*: 43% eradication over two months (Mrda et al, 1998)
* *Lactobacillus reuteri MM53*: 60% eradication with omeprazole vs 0% in placebo (Saggioro et al, 2005)
* Probiotic pretreatment improved failed triple therapy success from 71% to 85% (Sheu et al, 2006)

**Nutritional Support:**

* Vitamin C: Improves quadruple therapy success from 49% to 78% (Zojaji et al, 2009)
* Zinc Carnosine: Increases triple therapy success from 77% to 94% (Kashimura et al, 1999)
* Lactoferrin: Meta-analysis shows improvement from 74.4% to 86.6% when combined with antibiotics (Zou et al, 2009)

or are there any other recommendations to removing some of the bitterness? will dark roast always have bitterness? i started with a light roast but no matter what i changed with that it was always sour and read that dark roasts were more forgiving but whatever i do now ( grind wise ) it seems the shots are always bitter

  
I have a sage (breville) duo temp. i think i have my dose right as i filled the basket up with 19g of beans and used the razor tool that came with it and it removed the excess coffee down to 17.5",1,1739461089.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

(Part 9)","*‚ÄúAnd, finally, when the evil witch had her way, she cut out the hearts of the three heroes, manically laughing, screeching, ‚ÄúAha! I now have eternal immortality! I shall begin absorbing the children of the earth! Mwahahahaha!‚Äù*

I wasn‚Äôt expecting Kaz Delacroix to entertain himself by telling stories. 

I thought he was asleep, dozing on Rowan‚Äôs shoulder. He started with TV episodes. Breaking Bad from memory. 
Game of Thrones, from memory. 

But then he wandered into a territory a little too close to home. 

His latest ‚Äústory‚Äù involved an evil witch cultist. 

Smooth, Kaz. 

*Smooth*. 

His voice for the witch was a little too cartoonish. But I weirdly enjoyed it.

I thought they were talking to each other, which I couldn‚Äôt allow, but Rowan was asleep. Kaz‚Äôs stories had actually calmed him down. His head was bowed, his soft snores sending my heart into my throat. 

I wanted to untie his restraints, or at least loosen them. I wanted to let him shower, bring down fresh clothes from his room. 

I even found myself searching for ointment to soothe the markings on his arms.

But helping them was one step closer to feeling empathy, and empathy would get my brother killed. I had known these people for too long, developing relationships and attachments that were never supposed to happen.

Imogen Prairie had a heart of gold, which was her biggest flaw.

She was too naive, immediately trusting me because I was from her classes.

Imogen was a lonely girl, dumped by her parents at the age of sixteen and forced to grow up way too young.

She should have been smart, should have known that I wasn't a good person.

Imogen should have known not to trust everyone and that doing so would get her hurt.

And yet, she welcomed me with a smile, not suspicious in the slightest.

Imogen Prairie was the perfect vessel. The real world would eat her alive.

Charlie Delacroix was the smart, level-headed one. 

The one I was keeping a close eye on. 

I was already mentally considering his vessel as one of three royals. Mom said that's what she was looking for. 

However, as a human, he was too clever, and if given the opportunity, Kaz could easily come up with an escape plan. 

I had to give him points for being the least frustrating out of the three of them, though.

While Imogen sobbed and screamed threats at me, and Rowan tried to channel his inner Houdini to topple the three of them over, Kaz stayed calm and collected, reassuring them with hushed murmurs that everything was going to be okay.

He may have had a cool demeanor, but when the boy did catch my eye, I saw the anger and resentment curled in his lip. 

He stopped the story, settling me with a smile. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I cook us all a meal?‚Äù he suggested, and I couldn't resist a smirk when just the mention of home-cooked food jolted Rowan‚Äôs head of shaggy brown curls awake.

‚ÄúI mean, I love pizza, but not four times in a row.‚Äù Kaz gestured to his bindings. 

‚ÄúIf you untie me, I promise, hand on heart, that I won‚Äôt try anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúI second that,‚Äù Rowan mumbled under his gag. ‚ÄúI can't eat any more fucking garlic bread.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you were asleep?‚Äù Kaz murmured. 

‚ÄúYou're kidding. I wanted to know what happened to the evil witch.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn't even matter,‚Äù Imogen whispered. ‚ÄúShe's going to kill us anyway.‚Äù

Rowan sighed, lightly knocking his head against hers. ‚ÄúWell, maybe I want to eat something home-cooked before my heart is ripped out by the evil witch.""

I had been scrolling through my phone, ironically, searching for recipes. 

They were right. I needed actual food, and whatever was in their pantry (a moldy banana, a single slice of bread, and a few dozen condiments) wasn't going to satisfy any of us. 

There was Uber Eats, but again, I don't think any of us wanted takeout.

I stood from my chair, slowly making my way over to the three of them and grabbing my gun from the coffee table.

The weapon had always felt wrong in my hand, like it didn't fit.

I caught Rowan‚Äôs eye, who twisted his head, his gaze glued to my gun.

I wasn't expecting his lips to curve into the smallest of smiles under the duct-tape gag, like he knew something I didn't. Kaz didn‚Äôt look scared. 

His smile, when I tore off his gag, was genuine, and I hated that despite everything I had done to these kids, somehow they were still trying to be civil.

‚ÄúI can make us something home-cooked.‚Äù His smile broadened. ‚ÄúYou need us to stay healthy, right? For when you sacrifice us to your, uhh, your moon Goddess.‚Äù

He really was listening. I wasn't delusional.

So he had paid attention when I was talking about how beautiful She was, how they were going to fall for Her too, and how my family wasn't bad‚Äîjust misunderstood orphans, sons and daughters of the sky. 

I didn't mention my desperation to escape. I had to keep a level head and act exactly like my mother.

I told them of the 100 days and 100 nights of darkness, and the moon‚Äôs reign.

Our ancestors, who could shift their flesh into beings of light.

Rowan‚Äôs eyes nearly lodged into the back of his head from excessive rolling, while Imogen remained pricklingly silent.

But Kaz? Kaz had listened.

Kaz was ready to accept Her‚Äîand sacrifice himself for my brother.

Instead of untying him, though, I cut Rowan‚Äôs restraints, yanking him from the chair.

He stumbled when I grasped the scruff of his jacket. ‚ÄúGo upstairs, and get dressed.‚Äù

The man's expression turned fearful, but he tried to hide it, masking it with his signature smile. ‚ÄúJeez, make your mind up. Do you want to tie me up or not?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you doing to him?‚Äù Kaz demanded in a sharp breath, trying to lunge forwards. 

I shrugged. ‚ÄúYou said you want to eat actual food.‚Äù Keeping my gun trained on Rowan, I grabbed one of his shirts from a pile on the floor, throwing it at him.

‚ÄúGet dressed,‚Äù I instructed, when he just kind of held the shirt in front of him like an idiot.

Rowan did, throwing the shirt on. I noticed his hands were shaking. ‚ÄúOoooh, we‚Äôre going on a *date*?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going shopping,‚Äù I said, throwing him his coat.

I couldn't resist a smile when it hit him in the face.

‚ÄúOw!‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs expression crumpled, but he nodded slowly. ‚ÄúShopping,‚Äù he said with a strangled breath. I wasn't sure he believed me. Maybe Kaz thought shopping was code for, ‚ÄúI'm going to take him away and murder him without you.‚Äù

When the boy ducked his head, I slowly made my way over to him, kneeling in front of him. Kaz didn't look at me, avoiding my gaze. 

‚ÄúIf you touch him,‚Äù he whispered, his voice dropping into a hiss, ‚ÄúI swear to God, I will kill you myself. You said you need all three of us for this fucking sacrifice to work, so don't you dare take him away.‚Äù

I pretended not to see the tears in his eyes.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù his voice turned pleading, ‚ÄúDon't hurt my family.‚Äù

I was confused at first, thinking he meant his family back home. 

But then it hit me like a wave of ice-cold water when I caught his frantic gaze glued to Rowan, who seemed weirdly calm about the whole situation. 

These two were his family. He had told me about his biological one‚Äîhis homophobic father who refused to accept his choices, the people he loved. 

So, Charlie Delacroix had found his own family. I swallowed a lump in my throat.

A family I was part of‚Äìuntil I fucked everything up. 

Kaz was fiercely protective over the two of them, almost animalistic. 

His bound hands grasped for Imogen, his narrowed eyes never leaving my gun which was pointed at Rowan‚Äôs head.

In Mom‚Äôs eyes, I was looking at a true vessel for a King. 

Still, his words *stung*. 

‚ÄúDo you trust me?‚Äù I asked, my own voice catching. 

Kaz stared down at the floor. ‚ÄúJust bring him back safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you think I won't?‚Äù

I caught his slight smile bleeding into a silent cry. 

‚ÄúBecause you're a fucking psychopath,‚Äù Kaz whispered, and when he knew that hurt me, his words like pinpricks, he slowly leaned forward in his restraints. 

‚ÄúI hope you know that when you do this‚Äì when you sacrifice us to your celestial god, or whatever,‚Äù he rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThat you end up lonely.‚Äù Kaz followed my gaze, his tone hardening. 

‚ÄúBecause I know, that deep fucking down, *we* are all you have.‚Äù

Kaz was clever. He wanted me to admit he was wrong. 

That there was someone else‚Äì someone‚Äì who was making me do this. 

I was going to ask him if he could prepare the kitchen and wash the dishes, but instead, I tightened his restraints. ‚ÄúWe won't be long,‚Äù I said, slapping another wad of duct-tape over his mouth. 

Kaz didn't look at me, but he *did* ask if I could turn on the TV. 

Rowan, to my surprise, was actually waiting by the door, playing with his keys. 

I could see multiple household objects he could attack me with, and yet he chose to stay nonchalant. 

‚ÄúHurry up,‚Äù Rowan said, playing with his keys. ‚ÄúWe can go to the nearest 7/11 and get actual food.‚Äù He shot a smile at Kaz and Imogen, who looked equally panicked. 

‚ÄúRelax!‚Äù He told them, side-eyeing my weapon. I noticed he was paying a lot more attention to my gun. 

Still, Rowan Beck was acting again, this time trying (and failing) to convince his friends I wasn't leading him to his death. 

It was a good performance, but the second he stepped from my side, I shoved my gun in his back. 

I caught his expression twisting, the breath leaving his lungs. 

‚ÄúI'm all good! I'm not planning on running. I'm fact, Nin and I are gonna have a little chat.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù Imogen squeaked, before we could leave. 

‚ÄúI need sanitary towels,‚Äù she whispered, ducking her head. 

I caught her teary eyes, the twitch of pain evident  between her brows and something in heart my break split apart. 

I nodded, slowly making my way into the kitchen, boiling water, and preparing a hot water bottle. Imogen didn't thank me, but she didn't protest when I rested it on her stomach. 

‚ÄúYou don't make any sense,‚Äù she whispered, breaking into a sob. ‚ÄúYou point a gun at my head, and yet you can't stand to see me in pain.‚Äù Imogen‚Äôs eyes searched mine. ‚ÄúSo, *why* are you doing this?‚Äù

Instead of responding, I straightened up. ‚ÄúIt should ease the pain until we‚Äôre back.‚Äù

I made sure to lock the other two inside the house, jumping into the passenger seat of Kaz‚Äôs car. Rowan took the driver's side with no complaints, shooting me a wide smile. ‚ÄúDo you wanna listen to the radio? Ooh, I wonder what's playing tonight!‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù but maybe he didn't hear me, immediately flicking it on. 

‚ÄúSoooo, Nin,‚Äù Rowan began, halfway down the road, molding effortlessly into leather seats. He was squeezing the steering wheel a little too tight for me to believe his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually totally fine‚Äù facade. Rowan Beck must have thought I was born yesterday. 

I was waiting for him to do something really stupid‚Äîlike flash SOS with the lights or shout for help‚Äîbut instead, his eyes strayed on the road ahead. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs even your *real* name.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Nini,‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúI don't care,‚Äù he spat back. 

‚ÄúSo, why did you ask?‚Äù

After an uncomfortable pause which was him definitely trying to think of something to one-up me, he snorted. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe we trusted you.‚Äù I noticed he was squeezing the wheel so hard his fingertips were turning white. 

He rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúI told them there was something wrong with you, but noooo, apparently *I* was the fucking crazy one.‚Äù

I focused on training my gun on him. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre mad at them.""

I caught his sharp glance at my weapon. He was planning something, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what. If he tried anything, I would kill him and rip out his heart early‚Äîand he knew that. Rowan only had one advantage: the outside world.

‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm mad at them,‚Äù he sighed, cranking the radio up. ‚ÄúThey welcomed a goddamn psycho into our house‚Äìand I can't believe I *fell* for one.‚Äù

Ouch. 

This guy really was upfront with his feelings. 

Which made him weak. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to jail, y‚Äôknow,‚Äù he hummed when we reached an intersection. 

I found the soft click, click, click of the indicator oddly soothing. The colorful blur of late-night traffic was comforting. 

Rowan surprised me with a laugh, his tone turning sing-song. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to jail for a lonnnnnnnnnng time. I'll visit you, though. Since you‚Äôve got nobody else.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't‚Ä¶ say that.‚Äù I managed through gritted teeth. 

‚ÄúWhat? That you‚Äôre going to jail?‚Äù He whistled. Sweetheart, I can count your felonies on two fuckin‚Äô hands! You are done.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúKidnapping,‚Äù Rowan announced. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs already, like, a serious crime.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move‚Äîsuddenly paralyzed by his words.

‚ÄúForced inebriation,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou drugged me and took advantage of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt!‚Äù I shrieked, immediately losing my cool.

‚ÄúBut you could have,‚Äù Rowan said, his tone turning sour. ‚ÄúYou fucked with my head, made me think I actually liked you, and the next thing I know, I‚Äôm cuffed to your bed frame. You could have done anything to me‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúDrive.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt realize I was stabbing the barrel of my gun into his stomach until he brushed it away with a sigh. 

‚ÄúDo you want to explain to a cop why you're waving a gun around, or should I? Now, I‚Äôm no Einstein, but playing the villain is most definitely going to get us pulled over.‚Äù he shot me a look. 

‚ÄúHonestly? You're embarrassing yourself, dude.‚Äù

He was infuriatingly right. I stuffed my gun in my lap. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing this because I want to hurt you,‚Äù I managed to grit out. 

‚ÄúOh, suuureeee!‚Äù he spat sarcastically. ‚ÄúGive me a break.‚Äù

I had been expecting the slightest bit of empathy from him. Clearly, I was wrong. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already told us your weird cult story,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to achieve enlightenment from the moon, or whatever. Blah, blah, blah, the sky goes dark, blah, blah, blah, a hundred days of darkness.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not *just* the moon,‚Äù I said, then caught myself before I could spill my heart out.

To a guy who despised me.

He nodded slowly. ‚ÄúOkay, so *what* is it if it's not the moon controlling your mind?‚Äù

It was my brother. 

Jonas‚Äôs survival, and our escape from my mother. 

I didn't say that, though, biting my lip. ‚ÄúJust drive.‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúNo more personal questions.‚Äù

He laughed bitterly, turning up the radio. 

‚ÄúOoh, I like this song!‚Äù

Cranking up the radio to max, he rocked out to some old school 2000‚Äôs group, drumming on the steering wheel with his fists, and passionately mouthing the words. 

‚ÄúHave you heard this song?‚Äù he yelled over the music. 

I shook my head, keeping my gaze glued to my lap. 

Rowan laughed. ‚ÄúYou're kidding.‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou've never heard of MCR?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said. 

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Rowan yelled, viciously head banging. ‚ÄúDude, MCR were like THE band when I was a kid! I was obsessed with them!‚Äù he held out his wrist, and I noticed something I'd never seen before‚Äî a tiny tattoo printed on his finger. 

‚ÄúWhen I was in my edgy teen phase, I may have illegally gotten myself a tattoo in a dodgy parlor.‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúI did look older for my age.‚Äù

I was intrigued. ‚ÄúHow old were you?‚Äù

He grinned, and my stomach twisted. 

‚ÄúFourteen.‚Äù

Rowan didn‚Äôt speak again until we were in the store. I think he found peace in the music‚Äì and admittedly, I think I did too. 

Inside the 7/11, I instructed him to grab ingredients for a veggie Bolognese. 

The lights in the store reminded me of the moon‚Äîbright and invasive, sending a pulsing pain striking across the back of my skull. 

I was staring at the dairy aisle, trying to remember Imogen‚Äôs favorite brand of oat milk, when Rowan appeared next to me, holding a basket full of groceries. 

I raised my eyebrows at the giant red velvet birthday cake.

‚ÄúSince when were you turning thirteen years old?‚Äù

Rowan almost looked defensive, leaning away from me, his lip curling. ‚ÄúWell, if I‚Äôm going to have my heart torn out, I want cake.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you choose the worst one?‚Äù

He shrugged, copying me, pivoting on his heel and scanning the milk aisle.

Rowan was trying to find exactly what I was looking for. 

Imogen‚Äôs favorite oat milk. 

‚ÄúBack in the car,‚Äù Rowan said casually, picking up a carton and peering at the back, scanning the label. ‚ÄúYou said you didn‚Äôt want to hurt us.‚Äù His breath hitched. ‚ÄúWhich, if I‚Äôm right, means we‚Äôre  not the only ones being held against our will.‚Äù

His words were sharp, like the blunt edge of a knife. 

Jonas, my twenty year old brother, was all alone, chained inside a cold cell‚Äì at the mercy of our psychotic brainwashed Mom. 

‚ÄúBut I *do*,‚Äù I said, my voice betraying me, breaking apart. I realized that what I was doing was fucking ridiculous. 

Imogen Prairie was going to die, and buying her favorite oat milk wasn‚Äôt going to change that. I abandoned my search, grabbing whole milk instead. 

When Rowan stepped away from me, I yanked him back, tightening my hold on his wrist. ‚ÄúI *am* going to kill you, Rowan,‚Äù I said through a steady breath, trying to ignore the jolt in his body, the way he stiffened, his hands forming fists. 

‚ÄúAnd then I‚Äôm going to offer you to the moon.‚Äù I turned to him, fashioning my smile, mimicking my mother. 

‚ÄúShe's going to make you shine with her light.‚Äù I cupped his face, cradling his cheeks. ‚ÄúAnd you're going to rule this town as a merciful King.‚Äù

His eyes darkened. ‚ÄúOh, I'll be your King?‚Äù he teased, his tone souring. ‚ÄúWill I wear a crown?‚Äù Rowan mockingly bowed to me, his grin unnerving. This was the smile of a boy who realized he had nothing to lose. 

‚ÄúWill I sit under her *light*, Nin?‚Äù he mocked, bowing his head, as if being crowned. ‚ÄúWill I rule my town with an iron fist?‚Äù

When I couldn't speak, he straightened up, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúGive me a fucking break.‚Äù

Instead of responding, I pulled the cake out of his basket, shoving it into his chest. 

‚ÄúPut it back.‚Äù I muttered. 

Mom said I would enjoy having control over potential vessels, but I felt sick. 

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have time to eat it.‚Äù 

His head jerked, something splintering in his psyche. I saw it in his eyes. 

That light I was used to‚Äì that loosened the knot in my gut, was oblivion staring back. Still, he was Rowan Beck, the King of building walls around his emotions. He shot me a wide smile, his lip wobbling. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, I won't have *time*?‚Äù

I focused on the cheese section. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm starting with the preparations tomorrow,‚Äù I said, my heart in my throat. I couldn't look him in the eye. 

‚ÄúYou'll be dead long before you get to eat it.‚Äù

Rowan never looked angry. I was used to him looking mildly irritated, or pissed, but keeping it together. But this was real, raw anger igniting in his eyes. I found myself breathless. He really did look like a King. 

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs my fucking money,‚Äù he spat in my ear, his facade slowly coming apart piece by piece. Rowan wasn‚Äôt nearly as smart as he thought he was‚Äîor as nonchalant. 

This kid was just a scared boy with a loud mouth‚Äîand I had just told him I was going to brutally sacrifice him to a celestial light. 

He snatched the cake from me, his breath cold against my ear. He dragged out his words, slow and methodical and cruel. 

‚ÄúIf I want to buy myself a comfort cake, I will buy myself a comfort cake. Do you fucking understand me?‚Äù

I ignored him, stepping away before I could splinter apart.

I caught his gaze flick to an old woman in the bread section. 

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù I warned under my breath. 

His lip curled. ‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù he challenged. ‚ÄúShoot me in the middle of a 7/11.‚Äù

He started to back away in slow, dancing strides, throwing his hands up. 

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam.‚Äù he said, loud enough to alert the old woman. His eyes didn't leave mine. 

‚ÄúI'm being held against my will.‚Äù he spoke through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúPlease call the cops.‚Äù 

Despite my stomach trying to erupt from my throat, I stayed cool, shooting the woman a grin. ‚ÄúHe's joking,‚Äù I ran over to him, throwing my arms around him. Rowan stiffened. I nudged him playfully. ‚ÄúBabe!‚Äù I mocked. ‚ÄúYou can't just *say* things like that! What will your brother and sister think?‚Äù

Something in his expression twitched, and I saw that last lingering protest bleeding away. 

Rowan, surprisingly, played along, pulling me closer. 

‚ÄúYou're right, *babe*,‚Äù he said through his teeth. ‚ÄúHow awful of me! I'm such a bad boyfriend.‚Äù 

When the old woman walked away, shooting us a sheepish smile, Rowan tried to pull away, but I tightened my grip on him. 

‚ÄúIf you try anything like that again,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúI will shoot you in the fucking head.‚Äù

We bought the groceries, and the whole time, Rowan insisted on talking to the cashier for way longer than necessary, very obviously trying to drop hints. 

Luckily for me, the cashier had her headphones in, only entertaining Rowan‚Äôs ramblings with nods. 

When she responded with a simple, ‚ÄúCool,‚Äù he gave up and stormed out of the store, hauling his abnormally sized birthday cake with him. 

It hit me when we were in the car, and he'd already ripped into the cake, stuffing chocolate frosting into his mouth, sniffling through sobs he thought I wasn't noticing. 

He was getting chocolate all over the wheel. Jonas and Mom had taught me how to suppress my emotion, but I couldn't control the visceral reaction in my body, bile creeping up my throat. ‚ÄúIt's your birthday.‚Äù I whispered, and when he only responded with a snort, carving into the cake with one hand, and demolishing another slice, ‚ÄúRowan, you're going to make yourself sick.‚Äù

He took a sharp turn, chocolatey slew dribbling down his chin. ‚ÄúLike I care,‚Äù he spat. ‚ÄúYou said it yourself. I'm going to die. So, why don't we go on a road trip?‚Äù

When Rowan took *another* sharp turn, I realized what he was doing. 

‚ÄúRowan.‚Äù I managed to get out. ‚ÄúSlow down.‚Äù

He stamped on the gas, squeezing the wheel, his lips breaking into a grin. 

‚ÄúFucking *make me*, Nin.‚Äù

When he stepped on the gas, euphoria slammed into me, ripping me off guard. 

Like I wanted him to go faster‚Äì wanted him to send us plunging into oblivion. The window was open, freezing cold air whipping in my face and stealing my breath. 

Rowan let out a sob I wasn't expecting, slowing down slightly, the car skidding. 

‚ÄúYou said you don't want to hurt us,‚Äù his voice broke apart. ‚ÄúSo, you're having second thoughts, right? About killing us.‚Äù

When I didn't respond, retrieving my gun from under the seat and jabbing it in his gut, he broke apart, slowing down, taking another sharp turn, on purpose, making sure I whacked my head on the window. 

I watched him come apart, screaming into the wheel. It hurt me to see his self-sabotage, his attempt at hurting himself. ‚ÄúThat's what‚Ä¶ what you said!‚Äù 

He twisted around to look at me, tears rolling down his cheeks, his breath hitching. I think his own denial was killing him. ‚ÄúBecause you *don't* want to hurt us, Nin.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's your birthday.‚Äù I said, ignoring his outburst. ""That's why you wanted that cake.""

When he refused to answer, reaching for *more* red velvet, I gently pulled it away. 

‚ÄúHow old are you turning?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúTwenty-three.‚Äù He let out a shuddery breath, tripping over his words‚Äîwords like poison, as if he hated himself for breaking.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm twenty-three, and I‚Äôve been a nihilistic asshole my whole life‚Äîconstantly mocking my own existence and dwelling in my own existential hell.‚Äù 

Rowan was struggling again, sniffling. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm twenty-three today, and I‚Äôm not even thirty yet. I‚Äôm still young‚Äîand if I survive, I‚Äôll stop being a pretentious ass. I‚Äôll stop thinking I‚Äôm better than everyone. Fuck!‚Äù 

He was crying now, no longer trying to hide his fear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to die,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to speak, but he cut me off with a sob, his chest heaving, tears in free-fall. I averted my gaze before I did something I would regret. 

We were close enough. I could easily wrap my arms around him and give him that comfort he was crying out for. Instead, I stayed stiff in my seat, my stomach twisting into knots.  

‚ÄúEvery time it's someone's birthday, we get them a wildly incorrect cake.‚Äù Rowan let out a spluttered laugh. ‚ÄúFor my twenty first, they got me a cake saying, *It's a boy*!‚Äù

I could sense a small smile pricking on my lips. I hadn't had a birthday since I was seventeen. 

‚ÄúHow about you?‚Äù

His question took me off guard. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Rowan shrugged, his gaze on the road. ‚ÄúHow do you celebrate your birthday?‚Äù

I remembered my last birthday. I watched a sea of red pooling at my mother‚Äôs feet. 

‚ÄúI don't.‚Äù 

I caught something in his expression. But he didn't speak.

Rowan didn't reply. 

When we got home, pushing through the door, he took his time hauling the grocery bags up the steps. I turned to tell him to hurry up, and caught his retreating shadow trying to run. But not before I was two steps ahead of him, pressing the barrel of my gun against the back of his head‚Äîthis time, hard enough to hurt. I was right about him planning to run, which meant his breakdown in the car was pure pantomime. 

If Rowan got away, Jonas was dead. I wouldn't be getting that happy ending with my family.

But as I dragged him back inside, I couldn't breathe. It wasn‚Äôt fair that I was feeling this. Why was I sweating? Why were my legs shaking?

Why did I want to let him go?

The door was wide open, which meant he could easily shout for help.

Grabbing my roll of duct tape, I slapped a strip over his mouth, stabbing the barrel harder into his spine. 

‚ÄúGet on your knees,‚Äù I said through clenched teeth, willing myself to stop trembling. I yanked his hands behind his back to tie them, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to fight back. 

Part of me was in awe at how effortless he twisted, moving like water, as if the moon was already inside him, disarming me in one swift movement. 

The gun fit in his hands as if it had always belonged there, his grip unnervingly perfect. 

Ripping off the gag, wincing, he was panting but, unbelievably, grinning‚Äîwildly, almost feral.

‚ÄúNin wants to tell us something,‚Äù Rowan gasped out. ‚ÄúRight, Nin?‚Äù

When he trained the barrel between my eyes, I stumbled back. 

‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù Rowan gritted out, breathless. ‚ÄúFucking *say* it!‚Äù

I didn't‚Äì couldn't‚Äì say it. When I swallowed the words, he pulled the trigger. 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù Imogen screamed, Kaz muffling at him to stop. 

He shot me again. 

And again. 

And again. 

His arm whipped out, and he shot an empty round into the door. 

‚ÄúIt's blank!‚Äù He choked in an incredulous laugh. ‚ÄúIt's always been blank, because she doesn't *want* to hurt us.‚Äù

Rowan let the weapon slip from his hands, his eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúSay it.‚Äù he spat through a breath. ‚ÄúTell us exactly what you feel.""

I felt my whole body fall limp, my last ditch effort to save my brother, shattering into nothing. 

But I couldn't deny the words choking my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don't want to hurt you.‚Äù  

Kaz reached for his phone I had kept on the coffee table, but Rowan shook his head.

‚ÄúNo cops,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to talk to her.‚Äù 

Rowan took a step forward, and I instinctively took one back. 

Instead of shooting another blank, though, Rowan kicked my gun under the door, and gestured to the dining table. 

""Sit.‚Äù

I found my voice, glancing at Kaz and Imogen, who looked equally confused. When Imogen tried to lunge forward, Kaz gently dragged her back, murmuring to her. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I whispered. 

Rowan sighed, plonking himself down on the floor, crossing his legs.

‚ÄúFine. Sit on the floor with me.‚Äù

I did, slumping onto my knees, surprised to find the weight on my shoulders was lighter. 

After a moment, he shocked me with a laugh. ‚ÄúI was right,‚Äù he said, his own voice betraying him, splintering into a sob. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being held against your will too.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, lost somewhere between breaking down on the kitchen floor and spilling everything from my lips‚Äîour forced indoctrination into the cult, my mother‚Äôs brainwashing, and the promise to save my brother. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was hallucinating, but at some point, Imogen appeared by my side. She grasped my hands, entangling her fingers with mine. 

Half-delirious, I tried to scrub away the markings I had cut into her palm. She was so warm, letting me sob into her shoulder.

Kaz didn't speak, but he did make me hot tea. 

We talked all night, and the three decided they were going to help me save my brother. Rowan didn't leave my side all night, and even when I was sleeping, he insisted on staying with me. I had a chance to deceive him. I had a chance to rip out his heart when he was sleeping, his face uncomfortably pressed into my shoulder. 

But I was tired, and he was so fucking warm. 

Three days later, I was in the back of Kaz‚Äôs car. 

Imogen was next to me, her arms wrapped around a shoebox. 

Kaz had a plan‚Äì sort of. 

The cult was expecting three human hearts for the preparation ceremony.

So, after a lot of digging (and weird looks), we had three pig hearts, ready for offering. 

Kaz said pig hearts resembled human hearts, so it should work‚Äì in theory. 

‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù Rowan spoke up from the passenger seat. He didn't turn around, his gaze glued to the window, late afternoon sunlight setting strands of his hair alight. 

‚ÄúAll you need to do is dump the hearts, grab your brother, and run,‚Äù he said. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have the car ready.‚Äù Rowan leaned back in his seat with a sigh. ‚ÄúIf you're right about the cops knowing about the cult and even helping these freaks, then we‚Äôre on our own.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's okay.‚Äù  Imogen spoke up, grasping my hand. ‚ÄúNin is going to save her brother, and then we‚Äôll take him back to our place.‚Äù

Kaz nodded, tapping on the steering wheel. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep him safe,‚Äù he said, catching my eye. ‚ÄúBoth of you.‚Äù 

Directing Kaz to the rendezvous, my housemate drove me to the edge of Stix forest, where I'd be meeting Mom. 

Imogen handed me the box, and gave me an awkward hug. 

I didn't understand their willingness to forgive me. I felt myself melt into her, grateful for the warmth of her sweater‚Äì her flowery scent sending my heart into my throat. 

After everything I did to them, these three still cared. 

‚ÄúCome *back*,‚Äù Imogen whispered into my shoulder. She didn't let go when I tried to pull back. ‚ÄúIf things seem weird, just run away, okay?‚Äù she slipped a carving knife from her pocket, and I had to bite back a laugh. 

‚ÄúImogen!‚Äù Kaz hissed. ‚ÄúHow‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we need a *weapon*!‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúWe  can't fight these guys with nothing.‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs lip quirked. ‚ÄúI mean, *sure*,‚Äù he shrugged. ‚ÄúIf you think you can take them.‚Äù

Rowan stayed in the car, his back to me. ‚ÄúImmie, put the knife down,‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not stooping to these freaks' level.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you think that won't get us killed?‚Äù she whisper-hissed. 

I left them bickering amongst themselves. 

Leaving the three of them at the clearing, I stepped straight into cult-territory. 

I knew exactly where the carefully laid out traps were, designed to cripple strangers, jumping over a rope stamped into the dirt. 

Mom instructed me to meet her at the elder tree, under a crescent moon. 

Tipping my head back, a sliver of moonlight poked through the thick canopy of trees, and I shivered, tightening my grip around the box of pig hearts. I wasn't expecting candlelight under the elder tree, blurred orange lighting up the dim. 

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I started forwards hesitantly, quickening my steps. 

I wasn't looking where I was going, searching for her familiar ghostly face, when I glimpsed a figure bowed under the tree. Someone was praying. 

I took another step, and another, until my worn converse were stepping in something wet, a pooling darkness soaking the ground. I didn't feel the box slip from my hands, or hear my own cry slice through the silence. I should have known. 

Still lit candles, blood that was warm, still wet, soaking into the ground. I was on my knees, suddenly, retching, sobbing into familiar sandy curls that were so distinct, so familiar. Bile shot up my throat. 

My trembling hands didn't feel real, trying to find a pulse. 

Trying to find his *face*. 

Jonas‚Äôs body had been perfectly laid out, his head severed from his torso. 

He was another sacrifice, another body left to rot. 

I screamed for my mother, pulling my brother‚Äôs body to my chest and holding him, stroking his skin covered in markings. 

*Luhar*. 

*Nathur*. 

*Velilua*. 

‚ÄúMom.‚Äù I didn't trust my own voice, my broken screech ripping through my lips. 

I pulled what was left of my brother to my chest, rocking him, burying my face in his hair. I could have saved him. I could could have fucking saved him. I was so *close*. 

So close.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I screamed, my throat was burning, my chest aching. 

Mommy didn't do this to me. She didn't. She couldn't have. 

‚ÄúNin.‚Äù

I was shrieking, trying to justify my brother‚Äôs death, trying to scream for my mother, when warm arms wrapped around me, pulling me into a clumsy embrace. 

I didn't want it. 

I didn't want him anywhere near me, a constant fucking reminder that I chose him over my own flesh and blood‚Äì the one person I had left. I tried to shove him away, my voice breaking into words, words that didn't make sense, words that should have hurt him, words I instantly regretted. But he was warm. 

When his arms wrapped around me once again, this time harsher, and yet closer, an anchor keeping me from well and truly falling, plunging into despair. 

He smelled like cheap cologne and stale coffee, but I found myself clinging onto it, clinging onto him, and letting myself fucking break. When my cries were raw and broken and dying out, the muted world came back to me in sputters. 

I was half aware of Rowan kneeling in front of me, his head buried in my shoulder. He was trembling, or maybe *I* was trembling, the two of us felt both right and wrong, and losing myself in his smell, his heavy breaths and murmurs that everything was going to be okay, I realized he *was* home. 

Bathed in moonlight that bounced off him‚Äì and I was so thankful it did, Rowan Beck didn't sympathise with me‚Äì and that was okay, because I didn't want his pity. But he did pull me to my feet, steadying me when my legs gave-way. ‚ÄúNin,‚Äù his voice didn't feel real, waves crashing against rocks. 

‚Äú*Look* at me.‚Äù

In my half-delirious state, I did, my chest heaving, my stomach contorting‚Äì I couldn't fucking breathe. I couldn't *breathe*, and his eyes were what caught me off guard. 

Brown, with hints of ember-like orange.  

‚ÄúWe can walk away,‚Äù he said, softly. ‚ÄúYou and me. We can go back to the car, and  not look back. You can come stay with us, and there won't be questions or answers, because we *want* you in our family.‚Äù

He laughed, spluttering on a sob. ‚ÄúYou don't *have* to go back there. You can stay with us.‚Äù

Twin footsteps behind me sent my body into fight or flight. But they were familiar, hesitant at first, then quickening. Before I knew what was happening, Imogen‚Äôs face was buried in my shoulder, and Kaz‚Äôs arms awkwardly pulled me into a hug. 

It felt wrong, but oh, so right. I felt loved. Warm. Safe. The three of them were like a cocoon, shielding me from my raw reality. 

Rowan wrapped his arm around my shoulder, the three of them dragging me away from my brother‚Äôs body. 

I caught Rowan‚Äôs glance at Jonas‚Äîhis eyes glittering with tears.

He looked away, his lip wobbling. 

‚ÄúLet's go home,‚Äù was all he said, leading the way back to the car. 

Imogen was quick to pull my head onto her lap in the backseat and I remember the lull of the car swaying me back and forth. The three of them took me back to their home, pulled me upstairs, and tucked me into my bed. I didn't speak for a long time‚Äì but I didn't need to. 

Days went by. Weeks. Months. 

Imogen brought me meals and drinks, sometimes curling into bed with me, running her fingers through my hair‚Äì telling me stories. 

Kaz sat by my bed like a personal therapist, repeatedly telling me I was okay‚Äì I was safe. Nobody was going to hurt me. Rowan kept his distance for a while. But then he started to appear in my doorway, scowling his usual scowl. 

‚ÄúDo you want to, uhhh, maybe watch a movie?‚Äù turned into the two of us binge watching everything. 

I'm not sure when it was when I turned to him for emotional relief. 

When I found myself wrapped around him, my head nestled on his shoulder.

When I stopped resenting him for being here‚Äì while my brother *wasn't*. 

The memory jerked, pulling me back to the real world. 

Back to lying under the moon‚Äôs light, as she hollowed me out. 

My voice had been burned from my throat, my body a puppet cut from its strings. 

I was partially aware of Her filling my blood, hitting every dead nerve ending, entangling around my skull and delving into my brain. Rowan was still there, his breath in my ear, choked with hysterical giggles. 

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúWho would have thought that the *whole* time, you were the fucking problem?‚Äù Rowan leaned closer. ‚ÄúThat *you* ruined the lives of three strangers, and inserted yourself into their little family.‚Äù he jumped back, ‚ÄúIt's kinda poetic.‚Äù

I bit back a cry when his fingers tiptoed down my arm. 

‚ÄúFunny how that works, huh.‚Äù

With no mouth, no *voice*, I couldn't respond. 

‚ÄúI wanna show you one morreeee thing,‚Äù he sang. ‚ÄúIt's what she showed *me*, Nin,‚Äù he sighed, his eyes basking in her light. 

‚ÄúIt's what turned me into this.‚Äù Suddenly, she wasn't subtle anymore, speaking directly through him, his voice turning melodic, watery. ‚ÄúOh, darling, you should have seen his face‚Äì his mind broke into pieces, and I put him back together again!‚Äù

Rowan leaned closer, her light seeping from him, scolding my skin. ‚ÄúAgain and again, and *again*, until he stopped screaming, *begging* me for mercy,‚Äù she  mocked his cry, ‚Äúand finally let me in.‚Äù

He prodded me in the face, giggling. 

‚ÄúJust like *you* did! When you finally offered me young Rowan as a King.‚Äù

The moon gripped my chin, forcing me to look at him. His lips grazed mine, chuckling. 

‚ÄúAsk me how I died, Nin. *Please*.‚Äù His head tipped back, lips parting in a moan. ‚ÄúIt's all he wants to hear‚Äì oh, his tortured mind and soul *wants* to hear you say it.‚Äù

I didn't have to ask. The memory was already slamming into me. 

Three figures in our doorway, each of them I knew. 

Dex, Noah, and Harry.

Three of the moon cult‚Äôs brainwashed followers. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not interested.‚Äù Kaz stood in front, his arms folded. ‚ÄúLeave.‚Äù

When Noah pulled out a gun, shooting Kaz dead, the world spun around. 

Imogen crumpled into a heap, and I didn't even see the bullet hit her. 

‚ÄúRowan!‚Äù

I only found my voice when Rowan was bleeding out in my arms, his eyes flickering back and forth, blood spilling from his lips. I told him not to speak, and not to be scared. 

Holding him to my chest, I told him that no matter what, I was going to save him. The moon‚Äôs followers left quickly, knowing exactly what I was going to do. 

Wrapping them in a knitted blanket I pulled off of Rowan‚Äôs bed, I dumped their bodies in Kaz‚Äôs car, and drove to the town lake. Mom wanted vessels for royals. 

She *wanted* human skins for the moon‚Äôs light. 

I carved her name into the dirt, and my plea to her light.

Even coming back as her puppets, her royals, King's and a Queen drenched in blood, they would still be *alive*. 

So we could keep‚Ä¶ living together‚Äì our family. 

The family I didn't know I wanted - no, *needed* - until they were gone. 

*Luhar.*

*Nathur.*

*Velilua.*

Sobbing, my trembling fingers kept messing up.

I carved out each of their hearts, just like the moon told me to. 

*‚ÄùLuhar.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùNathur.‚Äù*

*‚ÄùVelilua.‚Äù*

The words tangled on my tongue, exploding into sobs. 

‚ÄúLuhar‚Ä¶ Nathur‚Ä¶ Velilua‚Ä¶.!‚Äù

Picking up Kaz‚Äôs body, I dropped him into the lake.

Scooping Imogen into my arms, I carefully lowered her into the shallows, before crawling over to Rowan, who was so still, so cold, his dead eyes tracking the dark sky. I bent down and kissed him, an eternal binding, that I wasn't letting him go.",1,1739460942.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False
1iolq9n,https://i.redd.it/zvscs8reexie1.jpeg,Castella Cake (Kasutera) Japanese Style in Spain,"Castella Cake (Kasutera) Japanese Style in Spain
Ingredients:
6 large eggs
80 ml of milk
2 tablespoons of honey
200g of sugar
200g of wheat flour for pastry (salted)
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
Instructions:
Prepare the mold:
Grease a rectangular mold and line the inside with baking paper. This makes it easier for the cake to fall apart properly.
Prepare the mixture of milk and honey:
Lightly heat the milk and mix with honey until completely dissolved. Let it cool down.
Beat eggs with sugar:
Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat at high speed for 5-7 minutes, until the mixture is frothy, triples the volume and turns to a pale yellow color.
Incorporate the flour:
Add the sifted flour little by little, mixing with wrapping motions using a spatula. Make sure you don't lose the built-in air in the mix.
Add the milk and honey mixture:
Incorporate milk with honey and vanilla extract into the mix, also with smooth, wrap-around motions.
Pour into the mold:
Pour the mixture into the prepared mold, making sure it stays even. Gently slap the mold against the work surface to remove air bubbles.
Baking:
Preheat the oven to 170¬∞C and bake the cake for 35-40 minutes. To check if it's ready, insert a chopstick in the center; if it comes out clean, the cake is done.
Cool off:
Remove from oven and let cool in mold for a few minutes. Then, gently unmold and let cool completely on a grid.
Serve:
For the authentic Castella style, wrap the cake in paper film once it is cold and let it rest for a few hours before cutting. This will help it have a more moist texture and more intense flavor.

I mean music that by itself makes a game feel special, or music that stays in the memory of players no matter how much time passes- Something that when you listen to it, makes you feel nostalgic for the game.  
  
Some examples are when you are exploring the world of Skyrim at [night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK4JSwhdcdE), or when you enter a [coffee shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woz5qvDdMRM),  in Persona 5, or the themes when you fight some sad bosses in [NIer Replicant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f03IHCr9dJY), or when in Shadow of the Colossus you kill a colossus and you get a feeling of [desolation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KUWVS1XVac), as if you had done something wrong.

1iolmm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1iolmm8/with_dreams_dashed_to_be_a_show_dog_luna_serves/,"With Dreams Dashed to be a Show Dog, Luna Serves as An Outstanding Reno Therapy Dog","Luna wakes up in the morning, like the rest of us, with a stretch and maybe a yawn. She eats breakfast, drinks some water ‚Äì never coffee ‚Äì then is out the front door and on her way to work.¬†

She is one of the lucky ones who has escaped the cramped, often sterile cubicle atmosphere. Instead, she travels around Reno all day, meeting people familiar and unfamiliar, doing one of the most important jobs in the world: making them smile.

Luna‚Äôs job is harder than you might imagine. One look at her resume makes it clear that this isn‚Äôt a job just anyone can do. But let‚Äôs break down what it takes.

The job requires two essential certifications. To qualify, candidates must demonstrate their ability to greet strangers politely, navigate crowds confidently, maintain composure amid distractions, and listen attentively to people. The next step of the hiring process is the most critical, and it is based solely on your looks. To be considered you should ideally have two ears, four paws, and a tail for wagging. That‚Äôs right, you have to be a dog. Specifically, a therapy dog. ¬†

Luna, a jet black standard poodle, is pigeon-toed. Originally trained to be a show dog, she had to switch careers early-on ‚Äì her condition kept her from passing both physical appearance and movement tests. Her friendly personality made her easy to adopt and lent itself well to a line of work requiring constant human interaction.

Behind every great therapy dog is their dedicated human partner. For Luna, that‚Äôs Mel Minarik, a retired professor of the School of Public Health at the University of Nevada, Reno and a current non-denominational minister. Mel and Luna have been doing therapy work for a year and a half now, but have been together for almost seven.¬†

""It's kind of like a ministry for me,"" Minarik said. ""To me this is a great way to connect with people.""

Connection is what drives both Mel and Luna‚Äôs work. Whether they're visiting the HOPES campus, a community health center serving vulnerable populations in northern Nevada, or making rounds at Renown hospital, Luna approaches each person with the same welcoming spirit. Mel finds humanity in these interactions. Given America‚Äôs fraught political climate, understanding and listening to others can be scary, frustrating, or both.

‚ÄúShe \[Luna\] greets everybody equally, and that's a lesson for me,‚Äù Minarik said. ‚ÄúThen, when I can connect with the people, the stories they tell me remind me of the humanity out there.‚Äù

An obviously inseparable pair, they learn from each other every day, but save some room for having fun. On their days off, Luna gets any extra energy out chasing bunnies and dog balls in the park while Mel watches and laughs.¬†

And their kindness does not go unnoticed; the good they do is deeply felt around the community.

One of Luna‚Äôs private clients has severe dementia and doesn't always remember her when she‚Äôs not around. But when they are together, for the moments that matter, she often says: ‚ÄúLuna knows everything, doesn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

It was not what I wanted to do in college but my parents (who paid for half my tuition) pushed me in that direction, and I wasn't strong enough to push back. 

By the time I graduated (with 30k debt) I was burnt out from grinding through it, had a drinking problem, and knew I couldnt work in that field. 

I moved to a new city. I had bartended my way through college and I just took the path of least resistance. Ended up working at a coffee shop/deli. Covid hit, and weirdly the place I worked did really well and it felt like a good job during the pandemic. Got a small promotion so I make like 45k a year, enough to be split an apartment and be slightly comfortable where I live, but not enough to save for anything. 

Now I don't know what to do. Costs are rising faster, student loan payments are probably about to start back up. Honestly as a little kid I kind of dreamed about just working a normal job in a city like I am but it's 2025 not 1995 and I don't feel safe or secure at all. 

I feel like my 'resume' is a liability. Like ""look at this idiot he got a good degree and then just f'd off for 6 years, we don't want a layabout like him.""

Grad school? I could imagine going back to university but the idea of re-leveraging everything and taking on more debt freaks me out. And I don't have a dream job/program. Plus getting in at this point would be a challenge because all my letter of recommendation connections etc. have expired, I'm super detached from that world. 

So I'm thinking:

Trades? Electrician or plumber maybe? Ideally I don't want to work construction but I could.Anyone out there doing non- construction electrical work? My concerns here are stability/seasonality of employment.

Or Medical? Certification as x-ray tech, pt assistant, etc. Feels like more schooling/debt, but still less than university and potentially more stable. 

Would love to hear from anyone who has entered those fields, what it's like to start out, how much stress they're under, how stable they feel.

I was told by my functional neurologist that there is something going on with my adrenals.

I am in the process of going to the endocrinologist.

My symptoms have varied but about 1.5 months ago I had some ""decaf"" that ended up being real coffee or decaf mixed with it and it was one of the worst day in a long time. I felt extremely agitated, the feeling was horrendous, and it took hours for me to calm down.

Ever since I have not felt as well. There is a history of other symptoms prior to this episode but this made things worse for me.

My functional neurologist said that it was a crash and that my adrenals needed helps and she put me on a cream called AdrenalCalm-SE from Apex brand and I think it is helping.

Things I have noticed:

- Mornings are the worst with mid afternoons and nights being the best but this rule is not perfect.
- If I sleep good, which I have managed to do, things are much better during the day.
- Constant malaise or just not feeling well.
- Labs in general have been mostly okay. However, I noticed that even though my T4 is in range, it was really low. Same thing with testosterone: not super low but low.
- I have had periods here and there of absolute bliss!
- I do not drink (but did in the past, 1.5 years sober now), I almost completely quick caffeine (I had had an occasional decaf).
- I was told I have dysautonomia and I think they mentioned POTS in my report from another functional neurologist.
- I describe it as ""having a mental hard time doing anything"" but maybe this is what fatigue could be manifesting as?
- Anxiety and depression are present.

I recently took an adrenal supplement my wife got and it wiped me for a whole day: I am NOT messing with that anymore BUT it might be a clue at figuring what the heck is happening with me.

Can adrenal fatigue cause these horrible symptoms? Is the endocrinologist the doctor to finally diagnosed me with AF?

been incorporating weight training lately as well since i'm of the skinnyfat type, especially when it comes to my abs. i do ab targeted weight training (with a 10kg plate or, for example, two 6kg barbells) at least once a week and a full bodypower session once a week. i think my abs definitely do ""exist"", since i can really target them with progressively more heavy weights and also, by running (engaging core etc).

now i eat very cleanly, never any processed foods, not too much fats, high in protein (though difficult because i'm vegan, but i try to get 20g per meal). here's a summaruyof what i usually eat in a day, since that should be very clear in this subreddit:

breakfast: mixture of 2teaspoons chia, chunked up apple, +-300ml soy milk and 300ml soy yoghurt, loads of cinnamon (my fav breakfast i cannot give up )

lunch: 2 slices of whole wheat bread with hummus and veggies, 150g tofu (which is abt 150kcal)

snack: apple and/or coffee with soy milk

dinner: one serving of whole wheat pasta/rice/quinoa or some other carb, loads of veggies and some kind of vegan meat replacement (tofu, tempeh, falafel, ..)

i'm unsure whether my diet is the problem for my invisible abs. i hesitate to change anything about it, especially when it comes to dieting for fat loss, since i just recovered from a bad eating disorder. my current diet is probably really good for me (i just got my period back as well) and don't want to start undereating to lose fat.

i love running, so i think doing more of that might be my best bet for fat loss. what kind of running should i do more to lose fat? i know about zone 2 running, which i did for the first time yesterday, and quite frankly it felt like a walk (5km in less than 50mins). should i do this more often? or should i weight train more? any tips appreciated.",1,1739460347.0,workout,6,1.0,False

I come with hat in hand and a very basic setup to ask people with more experience how I can maximise my coffee quality with the limited equipment I have.

So I have a Delonghi Dedica espresso machine with the original baskets that's come with it, I've upgraded to a slightly better tamper than what comes with it (because it was plastic) and a have a Krups Expert Burr grinder so I can at least get some consistency with my grinds.

About a year ago I went and did a one day batista course and learned the basics about getting an espresso recipe, balancing the extraction to get the right amount of espresso in the right amount of time. For the particular machine I was working with it was 60ml of espresso in 30s using around 18g of coffee.

Now since then I honestly haven't been able to make a decent coffee with what I have. I know it's cheap and very basic, but I've had a good coffee from one of these machines before and just can't seem to get the knack of it. The double basket I have won't fit the 18g of coffee so i usually try for 14g but not sure how that should affect the amount or the duration of extraction.

If the answer is spend more money, get a better coffee machine, etc, unfortunately I'm probably not going to be investing too much into this but happy to buy some better equipment if it will make this machine a bit more usable for me.

Effectively I'm hoping to get some tips on how I can maximise what I have.

Also I have good quality and expensive beans from a local coffee shop that are well known and from a barista can taste absolutely magic.

I've attached a few pictures, hoping I can get some advice or help. Thanks a mil!

There‚Äôs something about the stillness out here, the way the water mirrors the sky, how the mangroves twist like ancient guardians over the narrow channels. Out here, away from the noise and rush of civilization, you can feel the world breathe. Every cast of my line, every dip of my paddle ‚Äì it‚Äôs my way of syncing up with that rhythm. Been that way since I was a kid.

Back then, I didn‚Äôt care much for the regulations. Couldn‚Äôt stand hearing about invasive species and quotas. Didn‚Äôt see the harm. Hell, the more the merrier, right? All those exotic fish and reptiles turning up out of nowhere ‚Äì they made things more interesting. I remember the first time I hooked a snakehead, how it thrashed like the devil himself was on the other end of the line. I laughed that day, felt a rush like nothing else. They said those things were dangerous, that they didn‚Äôt belong. But out here, everything felt like it belonged. At least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

I‚Äôve changed my mind about all that. Funny how an experience can do that to you. These days, when I hear talk about regulations and culls, I just nod. I get it now. I‚Äôve seen what happens when things that don‚Äôt belong out here take root. I‚Äôve seen what they can turn into.

I used to think the Everglades were timeless, unchanging. But they‚Äôre not. Not anymore.

Not since that day.

I‚Äôll tell you about it, but you gotta promise me something first: if you‚Äôre ever out there, in the backwaters where the sun struggles to reach, and the mangroves close in tight... If you hear something rumbling just beneath the surface, something big, too big... Don‚Äôt go looking. Don‚Äôt be curious. Just paddle away. slowly.

Because some things out here... they ain‚Äôt natural. Not anymore.

Keith and I had been planning the trip for weeks. We checked the weather religiously, crossed days off our calendars, and even bailed on poker night just to make sure nothing would screw it up. It was supposed to be perfect ‚Äì and it was. Not a cloud in the sky, sun warm enough to feel like a blessing but not enough to cook us alive. We had the kayaks strapped tight in the back of my pickup, rods and tackle boxes piled up beside them, and a cooler full of beer nestled under some old towels to keep them cold.

We were halfway down that long stretch of highway cutting through the Glades, radio crackling out some old country tune, when Keith turned to me with that stupid grin of his. ‚ÄúYou heard about those herpes monkeys?‚Äù

I almost spat out my coffee. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù

He leaned back, putting his feet up on the dashboard like he owned the damn truck. ‚ÄúThey got these monkeys running loose down here. Real nasty suckers. Some tourist attraction brought ‚Äòem in years back, but they busted out. Now they‚Äôre all over, carrying herpes or some crap.‚Äù

I gave him a sideways glance, trying to figure out if he was pulling my leg. But he looked dead serious, his sunburned nose wrinkling up as he laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of it,‚Äù I muttered, but he just shook his head.

‚ÄúNah, man. Swear to God. Look it up. They‚Äôll bite your face off and give you herpes. Can you imagine? Explaining that to your old lady?‚Äù He puffed out his chest, putting on his best tough-guy voice, ‚ÄúWell, honey, it wasn‚Äôt no barmaid, it was a monkey. Honest!‚Äù

I laughed, the truck swerving a little as I wiped a tear from my eye. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot.‚Äù

But then Keith leaned in, his voice dropping. ‚ÄúAlright, serious question. Would you rather get bit by one of those herpes monkeys or a gator?‚Äù

I took a moment to consider. ‚ÄúGator. No contest.‚Äù

He looked at me like I was nuts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd rather get your leg chomped off than catch monkey herpes?‚Äù

‚ÄúA gator‚Äôs just doing what it does. Ain‚Äôt personal. But a herpes monkey? That‚Äôs just... wrong.‚Äù

We both busted up laughing, the kind of deep belly laughs that hurt your ribs and leave you gasping for air. Keith slapped the dashboard, and for a second, everything felt perfect. Just two buddies, the open road, and the promise of a good day out in nature‚Äôs bosom.

We had no idea what was waiting for us out there.

If we did, we would‚Äôve turned that truck around and never looked back.

Keith kept the questions coming as the miles passed, each one more ridiculous than the last. ‚ÄúAlright, last one,‚Äù he said, wiping tears from his eyes. ‚ÄúWould you rather have a Burmese python slither up your shorts or one of those monkeys bite you on the‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, Keith!‚Äù I shouted, barely able to keep the truck straight through my laughter. ‚ÄúYou got some sick ideas, man. Remind me why I hang out with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause no one else puts up with your ugly mug,‚Äù he shot back, grinning ear to ear.

We turned off the highway and followed a dirt road through the sawgrass and cypress trees, the world getting quieter, wilder, with each mile. Finally, we pulled up to our spot‚Äîa spring that fed into the Everglades, hidden enough to keep the tourists away but not so remote that it took a miracle to get to.

It was gorgeous. Sunlight filtered through the twisted arms of mangroves, dappling the water with patches of gold. The water itself was impossibly clear, a sheet of glass reflecting the endless blue sky. Tiny fish darted in the shallows, shimmering like flecks of silver, and somewhere above, a heron cut lazy circles against the sun. There was a stillness to the place, an ancient peace that made you feel like you‚Äôd stumbled into a slice of untouched paradise.

We unloaded the kayaks, the hulls scraping softly against the sandy bank as we slid them into the water. I took a deep breath, letting the smell of salt and earth and wildness fill my lungs. It was good to be out here. Away from everything.

Keith gave his kayak a shove and hopped in, the water barely rippling as he settled into his seat. He turned back to me, a wicked grin spreading across his face. ‚ÄúYou know, all this talk about rising water levels... If climate change was real, this place would be underwater, right?‚Äù He waggled his eyebrows, trying to get a rise out of me.

I rolled my eyes, shoving off and letting my kayak glide next to his. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be one of those guys.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt already gets hot as hell out here in the summer. If it gets one degree hotter, I‚Äôm kicking your ass,‚Äù.  
He leaned away, cackling, his laughter echoing off the trees.

We started paddling out, the water so clear I could see the dark, winding roots of the mangroves below, twisting like knotted fingers. Dragonflies danced above the surface, their wings flashing in the sunlight. A soft breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it the distant call of an osprey.

We were heading deeper in, following the winding waterways where the sun barely touched and the mangroves grew thick and close. Out here, the world felt endless, wild, untouched by time.

We spent the next few hours just drifting, casting our lines and letting the world fall away. Out here, time didn‚Äôt mean much. The sun moved slow, and the water carried us wherever it pleased. Every now and then, the silence was broken by the splash of a fish or the call of some unseen bird echoing through the mangroves.

I‚Äôd reeled in a couple of fat catfish, the stubborn suckers putting up a decent fight before giving in. Keith, though, was on fire. He was whooping and hollering, his kayak rocking as he wrestled with something big. When he finally pulled it up, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.

A young arapaima, its scales shimmering a deep red and gold in the sunlight.

‚ÄúWould you look at that!‚Äù Keith crowed, holding the thing up like it was a trophy. ‚ÄúYou ever seen one out here before?‚Äù

I shook my head, too stunned to say much. ‚ÄúNo way. Not out here.‚Äù

He grinned, teeth flashing. ‚ÄúGuess they‚Äôre spreading faster than we thought. Damn good fight, too. You jealous?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôd catch the freak fish. Probably rigged your bait with gold dust or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr maybe,‚Äù he shot back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just better than you.‚Äù

We went back and forth like that for a while, our kayaks bobbing in the gentle current, laughter mixing with the soft rustle of the leaves. Keith kept the arapaima dangling off the side of his kayak, its gills flaring slowly as it recovered from the fight. He said he wanted to get a picture before he let it go.

That was when I saw it.

A dark shape, long and thick, gliding through the water about thirty yards out. Its head broke the surface, two eyes like polished stones staring right at us. Big gator, at least twelve feet, moving lazy and slow. It watched us for a moment, then sank back down, a trail of ripples the only sign it was ever there.

I grinned, turning to Keith. ‚ÄúHey, hotshot. Why don‚Äôt you wiggle your fingers and see if it‚Äôll come over? We can give it that ugly fish of yours as a present.‚Äù

Keith‚Äôs face lit up with that wild, reckless gleam I knew too well. ‚ÄúYou serious?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell yeah. What, you scared?‚Äù

He flipped me off, then leaned over the side, waving his fingers just above the surface, calling out in a high-pitched, mocking voice, ‚ÄúHere, gator gator gator...‚Äù

We both busted up laughing, the sound carrying over the water. The gator didn‚Äôt take the bait, though. Just kept on drifting, moving slow and steady, vanishing around a bend in the mangroves.

Keith sat back, wiping a tear from his eye. ‚ÄúSee? Even the gators know you‚Äôre full of crap.‚Äù

I shook my head, chuckling. ‚ÄúOr they just don‚Äôt like herpes.‚Äù

Keith snorted, giving me the finger again before finally unhooking the arapaima and holding it up, the fish glinting in the sun. ‚ÄúThink it‚Äôll come back if I throw this?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúOnly one way to find out.‚Äù

He hesitated, his eyes lingering on the bend where the gator had disappeared. For a second, I thought he‚Äôd chicken out. But then his jaw tightened, and with a grunt, he hurled the fish through the air. It hit the water with a splash, its body flailing for a moment before it tried to swim off. But it didn‚Äôt get far.

The water surged, a powerful wave rolling toward the struggling fish. Then, with a burst of speed that didn‚Äôt seem natural for something so big, the gator lunged. Its jaws snapped shut around the arapaima, the sound like a gunshot echoing across the water.

‚ÄúHoly hell!‚Äù Keith shouted, nearly tipping his kayak as he jerked back in surprise.

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, my heart pounding in my chest. ‚ÄúYou wanted to see it up close, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

The gator barely made a ripple as it glided away, the fish thrashing once more before going limp in its jaws. It was huge, every bit of twelve feet, maybe more, its body sleek and powerful, armored scales glistening in the sunlight. It moved with purpose, a cold intelligence behind those ancient eyes.

Keith let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúDamn. Look at that thing. It‚Äôs a dinosaur, man. A freakin‚Äô dinosaur.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I agreed, watching as it disappeared around the bend, leaving only a trail of bubbles behind. ‚ÄúMakes you wonder what else is out here.‚Äù

Just as the big gator started to come back into view on the other side of the bend, the water trembled. At first, it was just a ripple, barely noticeable, like the surface was shivering. But then it grew, spreading out in wide circles, and a deep, resonant sound echoed through the mangroves.

It was low, so low I felt it more than heard it‚Äîa rumble that vibrated in my chest, rolling through the water and air like distant thunder. It reminded me of the mating calls I‚Äôd heard from bull gators before, that deep bellow they use to stake out territory and call to mates. But this... this was different. It was louder, deeper, almost... hollow.

The gator froze, its massive body going rigid. Its head snapped in the direction of the sound, eyes narrowing, muscles coiling tight. For a moment, it just floated there, perfectly still, its nostrils flaring as if tasting the air. Then, without warning, it whipped around, its tail churning the water as it took off in the opposite direction, faster than I‚Äôd ever seen a gator move.

Keith and I watched, slack-jawed, as the creature‚Äôs armored back disappeared around a bend, the water still rippling from its panicked escape.

Keith was the first to speak. ‚ÄúDid... did that thing just get scared?‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

He looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat the hell spooks a twelve-foot gator?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. My gaze drifted back to the spot where the ripples were fading, to the dense wall of mangroves and the dark water that flowed between them. Everything had gone deathly quiet. No birds, no insects, not even the whisper of wind through the leaves. Just... silence.

Keith tried to laugh, but it came out shaky. ‚ÄúMaybe it was another gator. A bigger one, right?‚Äù

I wanted to believe that. Wanted to believe that there was a logical explanation. But the way that gator had bolted, the sheer panic in its movements... it was like it‚Äôd seen a ghost.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, more to convince myself than him. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been a bigger one. Or maybe it‚Äôs mating season and he didn‚Äôt want to fight.‚Äù

Keith nodded, but his eyes didn‚Äôt leave the water. ‚ÄúYeah... yeah, that makes sense.‚Äù He let out a breath, his shoulders relaxing just a little. ‚ÄúProbably just a big bull. I mean, we‚Äôve seen some monsters out here before, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù I forced a grin. ‚ÄúBig ugly bastards. Mean as hell, too.‚Äù

Keith chuckled, the sound too loud, too forced. ‚ÄúYeah. Maybe if we‚Äôre lucky, we‚Äôll catch a glimpse of it. Get a real story to tell.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything to that. I just tightened my grip on my paddle and started moving, my eyes flicking to the shadows beneath the trees, to the dark water that was far too still.

I told myself it was just another gator, just another day in the Glades.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something had changed.

And whatever else was lurking in these waters... it was big enough to scare off a monster.

After a while, the tension eased, the strange ripple and the fleeing gator becoming just another weird story to laugh about later. We drifted along with the slow current, letting the sun soak into our skin, the gentle rocking of the kayaks almost lulling me to sleep.

Keith cracked open a cold one, the can hissing as the carbonation escaped. He took a long gulp, letting out a satisfied ‚ÄúAhh,‚Äù before handing me one from the cooler. ‚ÄúFigure we earned it after all that excitement,‚Äù he said with a grin.

‚ÄúDamn right,‚Äù I agreed, popping the tab and taking a swig. The beer was ice-cold, the perfect antidote to the humid heat. We floated there for a while, just sipping our drinks and soaking in the stillness, the world around us buzzing with the lazy hum of cicadas.

Keith leaned back, one arm behind his head, the other holding his can loosely. ‚ÄúMan, I needed this. Between work and the kids, I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô like I‚Äôm running on empty.‚Äù

I glanced over, watching as he stared up at the sky, a distant look in his eyes. ‚ÄúThat bad, huh?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúNah, not bad. Just... busy. Alyssa‚Äôs got that cheer competition coming up, so she‚Äôs all over the place. And you know Mason‚Äôs playing football now. Seems like every other night there‚Äôs practice or a game or somethin‚Äô.‚Äù He shook his head, smiling. ‚ÄúKid‚Äôs a bruiser. Tougher than I ever was.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúBite me,‚Äù he shot back, laughing as he took another sip. ‚ÄúNah, but really... they‚Äôre good kids. Just keeps me on my toes. Becky‚Äôs been stressed, too. Thinks we‚Äôre spoiling ‚Äòem. But hell, they‚Äôre only young once, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I agreed, letting my kayak drift closer to his. ‚ÄúBetter to spoil ‚Äòem while they‚Äôre little. World‚Äôll toughen ‚Äòem up soon enough.‚Äù

Keith nodded, his face softening. ‚ÄúYeah... I just hope I‚Äôm doin‚Äô it right. Feels like I‚Äôm fakin‚Äô it half the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt we all?‚Äù I said, surprising even myself with the honesty. ‚ÄúHell, I look at my brother, raising three kids on his own, and I got no clue how he does it. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm barely keepin‚Äô my own life together, and I don‚Äôt even got kids.‚Äù

Keith looked over at me, his eyes searching. ‚ÄúYou ever think about it? Havin‚Äô kids?‚Äù

I took a long drink, letting the cold beer wash down the knot in my throat. ‚ÄúYeah... sometimes. But I dunno. Can‚Äôt even hold down a relationship long enough to get to that point. Besides... ain‚Äôt no rush.‚Äù

Keith smirked, raising his can. ‚ÄúYeah, well, don‚Äôt wait too long, old man. Clock‚Äôs tickin‚Äô.‚Äù

I flipped him off, and we both laughed, the sound echoing across the water. For a little while, everything felt normal. Just two buddies, floating through the Glades, trading jabs and talking about life.

We let the sun drift overhead, the sky turning that deep shade of blue that only comes in the height of afternoon. I closed my eyes, letting the warmth soak into me, the beer buzzing pleasantly in my veins.

I could‚Äôve stayed like that forever, just drifting, floating, letting the world pass by.

A sharp, chattering noise snapped me out of my haze. I sat up, blinking as I tried to pinpoint the source. Keith was already looking, his head tilted back, a grin spreading across his face.

‚ÄúHoly crap,‚Äù he said, pointing to a low-hanging branch over the water. ‚ÄúWould you look at that?‚Äù

I followed his finger and saw them‚Äîmonkeys, at least half a dozen, hopping around in the branches, their long tails curling and uncurling as they chattered and played. I‚Äôd heard about the herpes monkeys that escaped out here, but I‚Äôd never actually seen them before.

‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù I said, already reaching for my phone. ‚ÄúYou believe this? They‚Äôre real!‚Äù

Keith was grinning like a kid on Christmas. ‚ÄúTold ya, man! Thought they were just an urban legend, huh?‚Äù He swiped his phone open, aiming the camera up at the tree. ‚ÄúThis is wild. Wait till I show the kids‚Äîthey‚Äôll flip.‚Äù

The monkeys were fascinating to watch, their little faces expressive, almost human. A couple of the smaller ones were wrestling on a branch, tumbling over each other, while a bigger one sat at the edge, calmly picking at something stuck in its fur.

Keith nudged me, his eyes gleaming with mischief. ‚ÄúHey, I dare you to get up there and give one a smooch.‚Äù

I snorted, shaking my head. ‚ÄúOh, hell no. I don‚Äôt need no monkey herpes. Besides, you‚Äôre the one always talkin‚Äô about gettin‚Äô close to nature. Pucker up, big boy.‚Äù

He laughed, ‚ÄúYeah, right. Like Becky‚Äôd ever let me back in the house after that.‚Äù

I was still laughing, my phone held up to get a video, when the water exploded.

I didn‚Äôt see it coming. One second, the macaques were swinging and playing, the next, there was a massive shape hurtling out of the water, its body arching in an impossible leap, propelled by a tail as thick around as a telephone pole.

It was huge, bigger than any gator I‚Äôd ever seen. No, not a gator‚Äîa crocodile. Its mouth gaped open, rows of jagged teeth glinting like broken glass as it launched itself at the branch.

The whole family of monkeys barely had time to scream before they were swallowed up, the branch cracking with a sickening snap as the croc‚Äôs jaws closed around it. Leaves and fur exploded into the air, and then the monster fell back, crashing into the water with a roar that sent a tidal wave rolling right toward us.

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I shouted, but there was no time to react. The wave hit, flipping my kayak and tossing me into the water like a ragdoll. Cold, murky darkness swallowed me, my limbs flailing as I struggled to figure out which way was up.

I burst through the surface, gasping for air, my heart thundering in my chest. My kayak was upside down, the cooler bobbing nearby, cans of beer spilling out and floating away. I whipped my head around, searching.

‚ÄúKeith!‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt in his kayak. It was empty, drifting in slow circles. Then I saw him, splashing wildly, his eyes wide with panic.

‚ÄúKeith!‚Äù I started paddling toward him, but the water was churning, swirling from the massive splash. ‚ÄúHold on, man!‚Äù

Keith was flailing, his arms slapping the surface, his mouth gulping for air as he sank, then bobbed back up, his face twisted with terror. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the water!‚Äù he screamed, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúOh God, it‚Äôs in the water!‚Äù

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, my eyes darting around us, searching for any sign of movement beneath the surface. But the water was dark, murky, rippling and swirling with the aftershocks of that thing‚Äôs massive tail.

‚ÄúWhat... what the hell was that?‚Äù I stammered, my voice shaking.

Keith was hyperventilating, his arms flailing as he tried to keep himself afloat. ‚ÄúIt just... it just took ‚Äòem,‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúThe whole damn branch... it just... it just took ‚Äòem!‚Äù

I paddled closer, grabbing his arm to steady him. ‚ÄúCalm down, man! We gotta get out of the water!‚Äù I turned, scanning for the shore, my heart hammering so hard it felt like it would burst. ‚ÄúWe gotta‚Äî‚Äù

The water rippled, a long, dark shape sliding just beneath the surface, circling. My breath caught in my throat.

Keith saw it too. His eyes went wide, his body going rigid. ‚ÄúOh God... oh God...‚Äù

Somehow, by sheer adrenaline or blind luck, I managed to get Keith and I on his kayak. He was shaking so hard that the whole thing wobbled beneath him, but he clung to the sides, his knuckles white, his breathing ragged and shallow. I stayed close, one hand on his shoulder, the other gripping my paddle so tight my fingers ached.

Neither of us said anything as we started moving, our strokes slow and clumsy at first. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that monster charging after us, jaws wide, teeth gleaming. But the water was calm now, the only ripples coming from our paddle.

We navigated through the winding channels, the mangroves crowding in close, their twisted roots reaching out like skeletal fingers. The air was heavy and humid, the buzz of insects echoing off the still water. My skin prickled, every shadow looking like a snout, every ripple like a tail.

Keith finally broke the silence, his voice low and shaky. ‚ÄúWhat... what the hell was that?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. I could still see it in my mind, that massive body launching out of the water, the sickening snap of the branch, the monkeys vanishing in its jaws. ‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt know, man. It was a croc... but not one I‚Äôve ever seen before.‚Äù

Keith nodded, his eyes fixed on the water. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt no American croc. Face was all wrong... longer, broader. And that color...‚Äù He shuddered, his shoulders curling in. ‚ÄúToo dark. Almost black.‚Äù

I swallowed, my throat dry. He was right. American crocs are lighter, almost olive or tan. But this thing... it was a shadow, a living nightmare. ‚ÄúAnd the size...‚Äù

Keith let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYeah. Ain‚Äôt no croc in Florida gets that big. Hell, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs one anywhere that big.‚Äù

I thought about that, the way it had moved, how easily it had launched itself out of the water. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think... I dunno... maybe it was some kind of mutant? Some invasive species nobody‚Äôs seen before?‚Äù

Keith looked at me, his face pale, eyes sunken. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what it was. I just don‚Äôt want to see it again.‚Äù

We paddled in silence for a while after that, our strokes slow and deliberate, every splash sounding too loud. The mangroves grew thicker, the light dimming as the branches overhead tangled together, forming a canopy that shut out the sun.

I glanced at Keith, his shoulders hunched, his eyes flicking nervously from shadow to shadow. He looked like hell, his face pale and drawn, his arms trembling. I could still see the fear in his eyes, the raw, primal terror that I felt echoing in my own chest.

Then, out of nowhere, he let out a shaky laugh. It sounded strange, hollow, almost hysterical. ‚ÄúHey... would you rather see a skunk ape... or that thing again?‚Äù

It was so unexpected, so absurd, that I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, too. The sound burst out of me, sharp and ugly, my body shaking with it. ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôd take ten skunk apes over that thing.‚Äù

Keith grinned, his lips twitching as he tried to hold it together. ‚ÄúYeah... yeah, me too.‚Äù He shook his head, his eyes still wide and wild. ‚ÄúHell, I‚Äôd even let one give me a hug if it meant never seein‚Äô that croc again.‚Äù

I laughed again, the sound bordering on madness. ‚ÄúYou know they‚Äôd probably smell worse than you, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúImpossible,‚Äù he shot back, a flicker of his old self returning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all cologne and manliness.‚Äù

I snorted, shaking my head. ‚ÄúMore like beer and B.O.‚Äù

Keith opened his mouth to ask another one of his stupid *would you rather* questions, the kind that was meant to break the tension, to get us to laugh, to forget. But I wasn‚Äôt listening. Not really.

I was too busy watching the water behind us, my eyes scanning the dark surface, the way it moved unnaturally, like something huge was lurking beneath. My heart thudded, slow and heavy in my chest. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, but I couldn‚Äôt place why.

Keith didn‚Äôt notice. He was too busy grinning like a maniac, his eyes flicking between me and the water. ‚ÄúAlright, alright‚Äîwould you rather be stuck in a cage with a pissed-off bobcat or‚Äî‚Äù

And then I saw it.

A flash of yellow, glowing in the murky water. Bright, almost unnatural, like a beacon in the dark.

I froze. My pulse shot through the roof, my breath catching in my throat. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. But there it was, cutting through the water, its massive body lurking just beneath the surface.

Keith kept talking, oblivious. His eyes were still focused on me, but he was leaning back now, feet propped up on his kayak, laughing to himself about the bobcat.

But the sound of his voice, the air around us, everything went dead silent. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. I felt my heartbeat in my throat.

The eye.

That goddamn yellow eye. It lined up perfectly with Keith, glowing like a warning, like something that was waiting to strike.

And before I could shout‚Äîbefore I could even *think*‚Äîit happened.

The water exploded with a deafening crash. The huge shape lunged out of the depths, its enormous jaws snapping shut around Keith with a sickening, final *crack*.

I saw his body jerk back, his hands still gripping the sides of the kayak, but it was too late. The crocodile's massive mouth enveloped him in one swift motion, and Keith was gone. Just like that.

The splash was so powerful it knocked me back, the force throwing me off balance, my kayak tipping dangerously. But I didn‚Äôt care about that. I didn‚Äôt care about anything but what had just happened.

My mouth was open, but no sound came out. I was frozen, my body numb as I watched the water churn where Keith had been seconds before.

I don‚Äôt even think Keith had time to scream. One second he was there, laughing, the next he was swallowed whole by that creature.

It didn‚Äôt make sense. I didn‚Äôt *want* it to make sense.

I spun in my kayak, heart hammering in my chest, but there was no sign of Keith. No struggling. No bubbles. Just the ripples spreading out from where he‚Äôd been taken, and the faintest hint of a shadow moving beneath the water.

I could barely breathe.

I wanted to scream, to shout, to paddle in the direction where he‚Äôd been pulled under, but my body wouldn‚Äôt respond. My arms were shaking too hard to move, my mind too tangled in disbelief.

But then, the most horrifying thing of all happened.

That yellow eye appeared again, rising from the depths, so close I could‚Äôve touched it. It glared at me, cold and empty, the size of a basketball, glinting with an eerie intelligence. It moved slowly, methodically, like it knew exactly what it was doing.

I didn‚Äôt know how to react. My limbs felt like lead, but my body screamed at me to paddle, to get the hell out of there. The water rippled around the creature, its massive head slowly rising out of the depths, as if savoring the moment.

And then, without warning, it sank back into the water, disappearing into the murky dark below.

I didn‚Äôt wait to see if it would come back. I didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I just started paddling.

As hard and as fast as I could.

I don‚Äôt know how I made it back to shore. My arms felt like they were going to fall off, my head was spinning, and my heart was still beating like it was trying to escape my chest. The whole time, I kept looking over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that yellow eye gliding just beneath the surface, following me, waiting for the right moment. But the water stayed still, calm as a grave, and I didn‚Äôt dare slow down.

When I hit the shore, I scrambled out of the kayak and onto solid ground. My legs felt like jelly, but I pushed myself forward, my feet slipping in the muck as I dragged the kayak up onto the bank. I didn‚Äôt even stop to catch my breath. I just kept moving.

I finally got to my truck, started the engine, and tore out of there like a maniac. I didn‚Äôt stop for anything. Didn‚Äôt even check to see if I‚Äôd left anything behind. I was just thinking of one thing‚Äîgetting the hell away from that place.

I don‚Äôt know how I managed to drive home. I was shaking, the adrenaline still running through me in waves. I could barely keep my eyes on the road, but somehow, I made it. I don‚Äôt even remember how I got out of the truck and into the house.

I called the police as soon as I was inside. Told them everything I could, everything I saw. The crocodile, how it took Keith, how big it was, how it didn‚Äôt belong there. They didn‚Äôt know what to say at first, but I kept pushing, kept telling them how dangerous it was, how it wasn‚Äôt just some lost gator‚Äîit was something worse.

They said they‚Äôd send someone to investigate, but I knew it was already too late. That thing was still out there.

I don‚Äôt know what it was for sure. But I suspect it was an Australian saltwater crocodile. One of those monsters that‚Äôs been turning up in places it shouldn‚Äôt be, like the Nile crocs people have dumped in the Everglades. Somebody must‚Äôve thought they could make a quick buck or just get rid of a dangerous pet, and now look where we are. Look where *Keith* is.

The thing is, sometimes there‚Äôs a damn good reason why environmental laws are in place. I didn‚Äôt get it before‚Äîthought they were just about being overcautious, or trying to ruin the fun for people who actually care about nature. But now I see it. We‚Äôre messing with something we don‚Äôt understand, and the consequences are real.

I hope to God whoever thought they could release that croc into the Everglades gets what‚Äôs coming to them. They deserve it. No one should have to pay that kind of price for somebody else‚Äôs recklessness.

As for me? I‚Äôm done. No more kayaking out there. No more thinking the Everglades is just another fun trip. I‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs out there now. And I know some things are better left alone.

Keith‚Äôs gone. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever stop hearing the sound of those monkeys screaming.

And that eye. That *damn* eye.

I‚Äôll never forget it.

Why do they care? I was totally ready to move up to 7.5 because I'm so happy with my results and they are fighting me on it. I begged them to put me up to 7.5 because of some special circumstances related to immobility and approval from my doctor that I'm actually losing weight. No go. 
I really need to know the purpose of the required amount of protein. Is it so that you lose weight quickly without losing muscle mass? Is it because I used to have a huge appetite and protein makes you feel Fuller longer? For me, it's not an issue. I am not at all hungry ever. My diet is a low carb low fat diet that used to work for me when I was younger and when I could work out. I just added it to my life on zepbound.  I don't have an appetite though. I have to force myself to eat, but when I do, I don't want any of the foods normally associated with protein.  For breakfast I only want berries and a cup of coffee. I sometimes muscle down plain Greek yogurt, but definitely not every day. I have no desire for eggs. I ate three egg whites for breakfast 2 days ago and my stomach was killing me. I don't usually have lunch because I'm not hungry. For dinner I tried to have lean protein and salad, but I end up wanting my salad instead and really forcing down half of the protein I should. I can't explain why my taste has changed but I'm really happy with it. I love having fresh crunchy juicy vegetables with lemon and tart fruit. I have been overweight with a huge appetite for so long, that it is so refreshing to have food no longer be a priority. 
Does anyone have any more information about protein and a way that I can get more protein in? Can anyone relate to what I'm saying about being happy having little to no appetite?",0,1739460139.0,Zepbound,26,0.25,False
1iolf5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1iolf5w/theres_something_way_worse_than_gators_in_the/,There's Something Way Worse than Gators in the Everglades,"I‚Äôve always loved the outdoors. There‚Äôs something about the stillness out here, the way the water mirrors the sky, how the mangroves twist like ancient guardians over the narrow channels. Out here, away from the noise and rush of civilization, you can feel the world breathe. Every cast of my line, every dip of my paddle ‚Äì it‚Äôs my way of syncing up with that rhythm. Been that way since I was a kid.

Back then, I didn‚Äôt care much for the regulations. Couldn‚Äôt stand hearing about invasive species and quotas. Didn‚Äôt see the harm. Hell, the more the merrier, right? All those exotic fish and reptiles turning up out of nowhere ‚Äì they made things more interesting. I remember the first time I hooked a snakehead, how it thrashed like the devil himself was on the other end of the line. I laughed that day, felt a rush like nothing else. They said those things were dangerous, that they didn‚Äôt belong. But out here, everything felt like it belonged. At least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

I‚Äôve changed my mind about all that. Funny how an experience can do that to you. These days, when I hear talk about regulations and culls, I just nod. I get it now. I‚Äôve seen what happens when things that don‚Äôt belong out here take root. I‚Äôve seen what they can turn into.

I used to think the Everglades were timeless, unchanging. But they‚Äôre not. Not anymore.

Not since that day.

I‚Äôll tell you about it, but you gotta promise me something first: if you‚Äôre ever out there, in the backwaters where the sun struggles to reach, and the mangroves close in tight... If you hear something rumbling just beneath the surface, something big, too big... Don‚Äôt go looking. Don‚Äôt be curious. Just paddle away. slowly.

Because some things out here... they ain‚Äôt natural. Not anymore.

Keith and I had been planning the trip for weeks. We checked the weather religiously, crossed days off our calendars, and even bailed on poker night just to make sure nothing would screw it up. It was supposed to be perfect ‚Äì and it was. Not a cloud in the sky, sun warm enough to feel like a blessing but not enough to cook us alive. We had the kayaks strapped tight in the back of my pickup, rods and tackle boxes piled up beside them, and a cooler full of beer nestled under some old towels to keep them cold.

We were halfway down that long stretch of highway cutting through the Glades, radio crackling out some old country tune, when Keith turned to me with that stupid grin of his. ‚ÄúYou heard about those herpes monkeys?‚Äù

I almost spat out my coffee. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you talking about?‚Äù

He leaned back, putting his feet up on the dashboard like he owned the damn truck. ‚ÄúThey got these monkeys running loose down here. Real nasty suckers. Some tourist attraction brought ‚Äòem in years back, but they busted out. Now they‚Äôre all over, carrying herpes or some crap.‚Äù

I gave him a sideways glance, trying to figure out if he was pulling my leg. But he looked dead serious, his sunburned nose wrinkling up as he laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre full of it,‚Äù I muttered, but he just shook his head.

‚ÄúNah, man. Swear to God. Look it up. They‚Äôll bite your face off and give you herpes. Can you imagine? Explaining that to your old lady?‚Äù He puffed out his chest, putting on his best tough-guy voice, ‚ÄúWell, honey, it wasn‚Äôt no barmaid, it was a monkey. Honest!‚Äù

I laughed, the truck swerving a little as I wiped a tear from my eye. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an idiot.‚Äù

But then Keith leaned in, his voice dropping. ‚ÄúAlright, serious question. Would you rather get bit by one of those herpes monkeys or a gator?‚Äù

I took a moment to consider. ‚ÄúGator. No contest.‚Äù

He looked at me like I was nuts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd rather get your leg chomped off than catch monkey herpes?‚Äù

‚ÄúA gator‚Äôs just doing what it does. Ain‚Äôt personal. But a herpes monkey? That‚Äôs just... wrong.‚Äù

We both busted up laughing, the kind of deep belly laughs that hurt your ribs and leave you gasping for air. Keith slapped the dashboard, and for a second, everything felt perfect. Just two buddies, the open road, and the promise of a good day out in nature‚Äôs bosom.

We had no idea what was waiting for us out there.

If we did, we would‚Äôve turned that truck around and never looked back.

Keith kept the questions coming as the miles passed, each one more ridiculous than the last. ‚ÄúAlright, last one,‚Äù he said, wiping tears from his eyes. ‚ÄúWould you rather have a Burmese python slither up your shorts or one of those monkeys bite you on the‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, Keith!‚Äù I shouted, barely able to keep the truck straight through my laughter. ‚ÄúYou got some sick ideas, man. Remind me why I hang out with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause no one else puts up with your ugly mug,‚Äù he shot back, grinning ear to ear.

We turned off the highway and followed a dirt road through the sawgrass and cypress trees, the world getting quieter, wilder, with each mile. Finally, we pulled up to our spot‚Äîa spring that fed into the Everglades, hidden enough to keep the tourists away but not so remote that it took a miracle to get to.

It was gorgeous. Sunlight filtered through the twisted arms of mangroves, dappling the water with patches of gold. The water itself was impossibly clear, a sheet of glass reflecting the endless blue sky. Tiny fish darted in the shallows, shimmering like flecks of silver, and somewhere above, a heron cut lazy circles against the sun. There was a stillness to the place, an ancient peace that made you feel like you‚Äôd stumbled into a slice of untouched paradise.

We unloaded the kayaks, the hulls scraping softly against the sandy bank as we slid them into the water. I took a deep breath, letting the smell of salt and earth and wildness fill my lungs. It was good to be out here. Away from everything.

Keith gave his kayak a shove and hopped in, the water barely rippling as he settled into his seat. He turned back to me, a wicked grin spreading across his face. ‚ÄúYou know, all this talk about rising water levels... If climate change was real, this place would be underwater, right?‚Äù He waggled his eyebrows, trying to get a rise out of me.

I rolled my eyes, shoving off and letting my kayak glide next to his. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be one of those guys.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt already gets hot as hell out here in the summer. If it gets one degree hotter, I‚Äôm kicking your ass,‚Äù.  
He leaned away, cackling, his laughter echoing off the trees.

We started paddling out, the water so clear I could see the dark, winding roots of the mangroves below, twisting like knotted fingers. Dragonflies danced above the surface, their wings flashing in the sunlight. A soft breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it the distant call of an osprey.

We were heading deeper in, following the winding waterways where the sun barely touched and the mangroves grew thick and close. Out here, the world felt endless, wild, untouched by time.

We spent the next few hours just drifting, casting our lines and letting the world fall away. Out here, time didn‚Äôt mean much. The sun moved slow, and the water carried us wherever it pleased. Every now and then, the silence was broken by the splash of a fish or the call of some unseen bird echoing through the mangroves.

I‚Äôd reeled in a couple of fat catfish, the stubborn suckers putting up a decent fight before giving in. Keith, though, was on fire. He was whooping and hollering, his kayak rocking as he wrestled with something big. When he finally pulled it up, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes.

A young arapaima, its scales shimmering a deep red and gold in the sunlight.

‚ÄúWould you look at that!‚Äù Keith crowed, holding the thing up like it was a trophy. ‚ÄúYou ever seen one out here before?‚Äù

I shook my head, too stunned to say much. ‚ÄúNo way. Not out here.‚Äù

He grinned, teeth flashing. ‚ÄúGuess they‚Äôre spreading faster than we thought. Damn good fight, too. You jealous?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúOf course you‚Äôd catch the freak fish. Probably rigged your bait with gold dust or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr maybe,‚Äù he shot back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just better than you.‚Äù

We went back and forth like that for a while, our kayaks bobbing in the gentle current, laughter mixing with the soft rustle of the leaves. Keith kept the arapaima dangling off the side of his kayak, its gills flaring slowly as it recovered from the fight. He said he wanted to get a picture before he let it go.

That was when I saw it.

A dark shape, long and thick, gliding through the water about thirty yards out. Its head broke the surface, two eyes like polished stones staring right at us. Big gator, at least twelve feet, moving lazy and slow. It watched us for a moment, then sank back down, a trail of ripples the only sign it was ever there.

I grinned, turning to Keith. ‚ÄúHey, hotshot. Why don‚Äôt you wiggle your fingers and see if it‚Äôll come over? We can give it that ugly fish of yours as a present.‚Äù

Keith‚Äôs face lit up with that wild, reckless gleam I knew too well. ‚ÄúYou serious?‚Äù

‚ÄúHell yeah. What, you scared?‚Äù

He flipped me off, then leaned over the side, waving his fingers just above the surface, calling out in a high-pitched, mocking voice, ‚ÄúHere, gator gator gator...‚Äù

We both busted up laughing, the sound carrying over the water. The gator didn‚Äôt take the bait, though. Just kept on drifting, moving slow and steady, vanishing around a bend in the mangroves.

Keith sat back, wiping a tear from his eye. ‚ÄúSee? Even the gators know you‚Äôre full of crap.‚Äù

I shook my head, chuckling. ‚ÄúOr they just don‚Äôt like herpes.‚Äù

Keith snorted, giving me the finger again before finally unhooking the arapaima and holding it up, the fish glinting in the sun. ‚ÄúThink it‚Äôll come back if I throw this?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúOnly one way to find out.‚Äù

He hesitated, his eyes lingering on the bend where the gator had disappeared. For a second, I thought he‚Äôd chicken out. But then his jaw tightened, and with a grunt, he hurled the fish through the air. It hit the water with a splash, its body flailing for a moment before it tried to swim off. But it didn‚Äôt get far.

The water surged, a powerful wave rolling toward the struggling fish. Then, with a burst of speed that didn‚Äôt seem natural for something so big, the gator lunged. Its jaws snapped shut around the arapaima, the sound like a gunshot echoing across the water.

‚ÄúHoly hell!‚Äù Keith shouted, nearly tipping his kayak as he jerked back in surprise.

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, my heart pounding in my chest. ‚ÄúYou wanted to see it up close, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

The gator barely made a ripple as it glided away, the fish thrashing once more before going limp in its jaws. It was huge, every bit of twelve feet, maybe more, its body sleek and powerful, armored scales glistening in the sunlight. It moved with purpose, a cold intelligence behind those ancient eyes.

Keith let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúDamn. Look at that thing. It‚Äôs a dinosaur, man. A freakin‚Äô dinosaur.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I agreed, watching as it disappeared around the bend, leaving only a trail of bubbles behind. ‚ÄúMakes you wonder what else is out here.‚Äù

Just as the big gator started to come back into view on the other side of the bend, the water trembled. At first, it was just a ripple, barely noticeable, like the surface was shivering. But then it grew, spreading out in wide circles, and a deep, resonant sound echoed through the mangroves.

It was low, so low I felt it more than heard it‚Äîa rumble that vibrated in my chest, rolling through the water and air like distant thunder. It reminded me of the mating calls I‚Äôd heard from bull gators before, that deep bellow they use to stake out territory and call to mates. But this... this was different. It was louder, deeper, almost... hollow.

The gator froze, its massive body going rigid. Its head snapped in the direction of the sound, eyes narrowing, muscles coiling tight. For a moment, it just floated there, perfectly still, its nostrils flaring as if tasting the air. Then, without warning, it whipped around, its tail churning the water as it took off in the opposite direction, faster than I‚Äôd ever seen a gator move.

Keith and I watched, slack-jawed, as the creature‚Äôs armored back disappeared around a bend, the water still rippling from its panicked escape.

Keith was the first to speak. ‚ÄúDid... did that thing just get scared?‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

He looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúWhat the hell spooks a twelve-foot gator?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. My gaze drifted back to the spot where the ripples were fading, to the dense wall of mangroves and the dark water that flowed between them. Everything had gone deathly quiet. No birds, no insects, not even the whisper of wind through the leaves. Just... silence.

Keith tried to laugh, but it came out shaky. ‚ÄúMaybe it was another gator. A bigger one, right?‚Äù

I wanted to believe that. Wanted to believe that there was a logical explanation. But the way that gator had bolted, the sheer panic in its movements... it was like it‚Äôd seen a ghost.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, more to convince myself than him. ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been a bigger one. Or maybe it‚Äôs mating season and he didn‚Äôt want to fight.‚Äù

Keith nodded, but his eyes didn‚Äôt leave the water. ‚ÄúYeah... yeah, that makes sense.‚Äù He let out a breath, his shoulders relaxing just a little. ‚ÄúProbably just a big bull. I mean, we‚Äôve seen some monsters out here before, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù I forced a grin. ‚ÄúBig ugly bastards. Mean as hell, too.‚Äù

Keith chuckled, the sound too loud, too forced. ‚ÄúYeah. Maybe if we‚Äôre lucky, we‚Äôll catch a glimpse of it. Get a real story to tell.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything to that. I just tightened my grip on my paddle and started moving, my eyes flicking to the shadows beneath the trees, to the dark water that was far too still.

I told myself it was just another gator, just another day in the Glades.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something had changed.

And whatever else was lurking in these waters... it was big enough to scare off a monster.

After a while, the tension eased, the strange ripple and the fleeing gator becoming just another weird story to laugh about later. We drifted along with the slow current, letting the sun soak into our skin, the gentle rocking of the kayaks almost lulling me to sleep.

Keith cracked open a cold one, the can hissing as the carbonation escaped. He took a long gulp, letting out a satisfied ‚ÄúAhh,‚Äù before handing me one from the cooler. ‚ÄúFigure we earned it after all that excitement,‚Äù he said with a grin.

‚ÄúDamn right,‚Äù I agreed, popping the tab and taking a swig. The beer was ice-cold, the perfect antidote to the humid heat. We floated there for a while, just sipping our drinks and soaking in the stillness, the world around us buzzing with the lazy hum of cicadas.

Keith leaned back, one arm behind his head, the other holding his can loosely. ‚ÄúMan, I needed this. Between work and the kids, I‚Äôve been feelin‚Äô like I‚Äôm running on empty.‚Äù

I glanced over, watching as he stared up at the sky, a distant look in his eyes. ‚ÄúThat bad, huh?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúNah, not bad. Just... busy. Alyssa‚Äôs got that cheer competition coming up, so she‚Äôs all over the place. And you know Mason‚Äôs playing football now. Seems like every other night there‚Äôs practice or a game or somethin‚Äô.‚Äù He shook his head, smiling. ‚ÄúKid‚Äôs a bruiser. Tougher than I ever was.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúBite me,‚Äù he shot back, laughing as he took another sip. ‚ÄúNah, but really... they‚Äôre good kids. Just keeps me on my toes. Becky‚Äôs been stressed, too. Thinks we‚Äôre spoiling ‚Äòem. But hell, they‚Äôre only young once, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I agreed, letting my kayak drift closer to his. ‚ÄúBetter to spoil ‚Äòem while they‚Äôre little. World‚Äôll toughen ‚Äòem up soon enough.‚Äù

Keith nodded, his face softening. ‚ÄúYeah... I just hope I‚Äôm doin‚Äô it right. Feels like I‚Äôm fakin‚Äô it half the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt we all?‚Äù I said, surprising even myself with the honesty. ‚ÄúHell, I look at my brother, raising three kids on his own, and I got no clue how he does it. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm barely keepin‚Äô my own life together, and I don‚Äôt even got kids.‚Äù

Keith looked over at me, his eyes searching. ‚ÄúYou ever think about it? Havin‚Äô kids?‚Äù

I took a long drink, letting the cold beer wash down the knot in my throat. ‚ÄúYeah... sometimes. But I dunno. Can‚Äôt even hold down a relationship long enough to get to that point. Besides... ain‚Äôt no rush.‚Äù

Keith smirked, raising his can. ‚ÄúYeah, well, don‚Äôt wait too long, old man. Clock‚Äôs tickin‚Äô.‚Äù

I flipped him off, and we both laughed, the sound echoing across the water. For a little while, everything felt normal. Just two buddies, floating through the Glades, trading jabs and talking about life.

We let the sun drift overhead, the sky turning that deep shade of blue that only comes in the height of afternoon. I closed my eyes, letting the warmth soak into me, the beer buzzing pleasantly in my veins.

I could‚Äôve stayed like that forever, just drifting, floating, letting the world pass by.

A sharp, chattering noise snapped me out of my haze. I sat up, blinking as I tried to pinpoint the source. Keith was already looking, his head tilted back, a grin spreading across his face.

‚ÄúHoly crap,‚Äù he said, pointing to a low-hanging branch over the water. ‚ÄúWould you look at that?‚Äù

I followed his finger and saw them‚Äîmonkeys, at least half a dozen, hopping around in the branches, their long tails curling and uncurling as they chattered and played. I‚Äôd heard about the herpes monkeys that escaped out here, but I‚Äôd never actually seen them before.

‚ÄúNo way!‚Äù I said, already reaching for my phone. ‚ÄúYou believe this? They‚Äôre real!‚Äù

Keith was grinning like a kid on Christmas. ‚ÄúTold ya, man! Thought they were just an urban legend, huh?‚Äù He swiped his phone open, aiming the camera up at the tree. ‚ÄúThis is wild. Wait till I show the kids‚Äîthey‚Äôll flip.‚Äù

The monkeys were fascinating to watch, their little faces expressive, almost human. A couple of the smaller ones were wrestling on a branch, tumbling over each other, while a bigger one sat at the edge, calmly picking at something stuck in its fur.

Keith nudged me, his eyes gleaming with mischief. ‚ÄúHey, I dare you to get up there and give one a smooch.‚Äù

I snorted, shaking my head. ‚ÄúOh, hell no. I don‚Äôt need no monkey herpes. Besides, you‚Äôre the one always talkin‚Äô about gettin‚Äô close to nature. Pucker up, big boy.‚Äù

He laughed, ‚ÄúYeah, right. Like Becky‚Äôd ever let me back in the house after that.‚Äù

I was still laughing, my phone held up to get a video, when the water exploded.

I didn‚Äôt see it coming. One second, the macaques were swinging and playing, the next, there was a massive shape hurtling out of the water, its body arching in an impossible leap, propelled by a tail as thick around as a telephone pole.

It was huge, bigger than any gator I‚Äôd ever seen. No, not a gator‚Äîa crocodile. Its mouth gaped open, rows of jagged teeth glinting like broken glass as it launched itself at the branch.

The whole family of monkeys barely had time to scream before they were swallowed up, the branch cracking with a sickening snap as the croc‚Äôs jaws closed around it. Leaves and fur exploded into the air, and then the monster fell back, crashing into the water with a roar that sent a tidal wave rolling right toward us.

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I shouted, but there was no time to react. The wave hit, flipping my kayak and tossing me into the water like a ragdoll. Cold, murky darkness swallowed me, my limbs flailing as I struggled to figure out which way was up.

I burst through the surface, gasping for air, my heart thundering in my chest. My kayak was upside down, the cooler bobbing nearby, cans of beer spilling out and floating away. I whipped my head around, searching.

‚ÄúKeith!‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt in his kayak. It was empty, drifting in slow circles. Then I saw him, splashing wildly, his eyes wide with panic.

‚ÄúKeith!‚Äù I started paddling toward him, but the water was churning, swirling from the massive splash. ‚ÄúHold on, man!‚Äù

Keith was flailing, his arms slapping the surface, his mouth gulping for air as he sank, then bobbed back up, his face twisted with terror. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the water!‚Äù he screamed, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúOh God, it‚Äôs in the water!‚Äù

I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, my eyes darting around us, searching for any sign of movement beneath the surface. But the water was dark, murky, rippling and swirling with the aftershocks of that thing‚Äôs massive tail.

‚ÄúWhat... what the hell was that?‚Äù I stammered, my voice shaking.

Keith was hyperventilating, his arms flailing as he tried to keep himself afloat. ‚ÄúIt just... it just took ‚Äòem,‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúThe whole damn branch... it just... it just took ‚Äòem!‚Äù

I paddled closer, grabbing his arm to steady him. ‚ÄúCalm down, man! We gotta get out of the water!‚Äù I turned, scanning for the shore, my heart hammering so hard it felt like it would burst. ‚ÄúWe gotta‚Äî‚Äù

The water rippled, a long, dark shape sliding just beneath the surface, circling. My breath caught in my throat.

Keith saw it too. His eyes went wide, his body going rigid. ‚ÄúOh God... oh God...‚Äù

Somehow, by sheer adrenaline or blind luck, I managed to get Keith and I on his kayak. He was shaking so hard that the whole thing wobbled beneath him, but he clung to the sides, his knuckles white, his breathing ragged and shallow. I stayed close, one hand on his shoulder, the other gripping my paddle so tight my fingers ached.

Neither of us said anything as we started moving, our strokes slow and clumsy at first. I kept glancing over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that monster charging after us, jaws wide, teeth gleaming. But the water was calm now, the only ripples coming from our paddle.

We navigated through the winding channels, the mangroves crowding in close, their twisted roots reaching out like skeletal fingers. The air was heavy and humid, the buzz of insects echoing off the still water. My skin prickled, every shadow looking like a snout, every ripple like a tail.

Keith finally broke the silence, his voice low and shaky. ‚ÄúWhat... what the hell was that?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have an answer. I could still see it in my mind, that massive body launching out of the water, the sickening snap of the branch, the monkeys vanishing in its jaws. ‚ÄúI... I don‚Äôt know, man. It was a croc... but not one I‚Äôve ever seen before.‚Äù

Keith nodded, his eyes fixed on the water. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt no American croc. Face was all wrong... longer, broader. And that color...‚Äù He shuddered, his shoulders curling in. ‚ÄúToo dark. Almost black.‚Äù

I swallowed, my throat dry. He was right. American crocs are lighter, almost olive or tan. But this thing... it was a shadow, a living nightmare. ‚ÄúAnd the size...‚Äù

Keith let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYeah. Ain‚Äôt no croc in Florida gets that big. Hell, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs one anywhere that big.‚Äù

I thought about that, the way it had moved, how easily it had launched itself out of the water. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think... I dunno... maybe it was some kind of mutant? Some invasive species nobody‚Äôs seen before?‚Äù

Keith looked at me, his face pale, eyes sunken. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what it was. I just don‚Äôt want to see it again.‚Äù

We paddled in silence for a while after that, our strokes slow and deliberate, every splash sounding too loud. The mangroves grew thicker, the light dimming as the branches overhead tangled together, forming a canopy that shut out the sun.

I glanced at Keith, his shoulders hunched, his eyes flicking nervously from shadow to shadow. He looked like hell, his face pale and drawn, his arms trembling. I could still see the fear in his eyes, the raw, primal terror that I felt echoing in my own chest.

Then, out of nowhere, he let out a shaky laugh. It sounded strange, hollow, almost hysterical. ‚ÄúHey... would you rather see a skunk ape... or that thing again?‚Äù

It was so unexpected, so absurd, that I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, too. The sound burst out of me, sharp and ugly, my body shaking with it. ‚ÄúMan, I‚Äôd take ten skunk apes over that thing.‚Äù

Keith grinned, his lips twitching as he tried to hold it together. ‚ÄúYeah... yeah, me too.‚Äù He shook his head, his eyes still wide and wild. ‚ÄúHell, I‚Äôd even let one give me a hug if it meant never seein‚Äô that croc again.‚Äù

I laughed again, the sound bordering on madness. ‚ÄúYou know they‚Äôd probably smell worse than you, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúImpossible,‚Äù he shot back, a flicker of his old self returning. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all cologne and manliness.‚Äù

I snorted, shaking my head. ‚ÄúMore like beer and B.O.‚Äù

Keith opened his mouth to ask another one of his stupid *would you rather* questions, the kind that was meant to break the tension, to get us to laugh, to forget. But I wasn‚Äôt listening. Not really.

I was too busy watching the water behind us, my eyes scanning the dark surface, the way it moved unnaturally, like something huge was lurking beneath. My heart thudded, slow and heavy in my chest. I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up, but I couldn‚Äôt place why.

Keith didn‚Äôt notice. He was too busy grinning like a maniac, his eyes flicking between me and the water. ‚ÄúAlright, alright‚Äîwould you rather be stuck in a cage with a pissed-off bobcat or‚Äî‚Äù

And then I saw it.

A flash of yellow, glowing in the murky water. Bright, almost unnatural, like a beacon in the dark.

I froze. My pulse shot through the roof, my breath catching in my throat. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it. But there it was, cutting through the water, its massive body lurking just beneath the surface.

Keith kept talking, oblivious. His eyes were still focused on me, but he was leaning back now, feet propped up on his kayak, laughing to himself about the bobcat.

But the sound of his voice, the air around us, everything went dead silent. I could hear the blood rushing in my ears. I felt my heartbeat in my throat.

The eye.

That goddamn yellow eye. It lined up perfectly with Keith, glowing like a warning, like something that was waiting to strike.

And before I could shout‚Äîbefore I could even *think*‚Äîit happened.

The water exploded with a deafening crash. The huge shape lunged out of the depths, its enormous jaws snapping shut around Keith with a sickening, final *crack*.

I saw his body jerk back, his hands still gripping the sides of the kayak, but it was too late. The crocodile's massive mouth enveloped him in one swift motion, and Keith was gone. Just like that.

The splash was so powerful it knocked me back, the force throwing me off balance, my kayak tipping dangerously. But I didn‚Äôt care about that. I didn‚Äôt care about anything but what had just happened.

My mouth was open, but no sound came out. I was frozen, my body numb as I watched the water churn where Keith had been seconds before.

I don‚Äôt even think Keith had time to scream. One second he was there, laughing, the next he was swallowed whole by that creature.

It didn‚Äôt make sense. I didn‚Äôt *want* it to make sense.

I spun in my kayak, heart hammering in my chest, but there was no sign of Keith. No struggling. No bubbles. Just the ripples spreading out from where he‚Äôd been taken, and the faintest hint of a shadow moving beneath the water.

I could barely breathe.

I wanted to scream, to shout, to paddle in the direction where he‚Äôd been pulled under, but my body wouldn‚Äôt respond. My arms were shaking too hard to move, my mind too tangled in disbelief.

But then, the most horrifying thing of all happened.

That yellow eye appeared again, rising from the depths, so close I could‚Äôve touched it. It glared at me, cold and empty, the size of a basketball, glinting with an eerie intelligence. It moved slowly, methodically, like it knew exactly what it was doing.

I didn‚Äôt know how to react. My limbs felt like lead, but my body screamed at me to paddle, to get the hell out of there. The water rippled around the creature, its massive head slowly rising out of the depths, as if savoring the moment.

And then, without warning, it sank back into the water, disappearing into the murky dark below.

I didn‚Äôt wait to see if it would come back. I didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

I just started paddling.

As hard and as fast as I could.

I don‚Äôt know how I made it back to shore. My arms felt like they were going to fall off, my head was spinning, and my heart was still beating like it was trying to escape my chest. The whole time, I kept looking over my shoulder, half-expecting to see that yellow eye gliding just beneath the surface, following me, waiting for the right moment. But the water stayed still, calm as a grave, and I didn‚Äôt dare slow down.

When I hit the shore, I scrambled out of the kayak and onto solid ground. My legs felt like jelly, but I pushed myself forward, my feet slipping in the muck as I dragged the kayak up onto the bank. I didn‚Äôt even stop to catch my breath. I just kept moving.

I finally got to my truck, started the engine, and tore out of there like a maniac. I didn‚Äôt stop for anything. Didn‚Äôt even check to see if I‚Äôd left anything behind. I was just thinking of one thing‚Äîgetting the hell away from that place.

I don‚Äôt know how I managed to drive home. I was shaking, the adrenaline still running through me in waves. I could barely keep my eyes on the road, but somehow, I made it. I don‚Äôt even remember how I got out of the truck and into the house.

I called the police as soon as I was inside. Told them everything I could, everything I saw. The crocodile, how it took Keith, how big it was, how it didn‚Äôt belong there. They didn‚Äôt know what to say at first, but I kept pushing, kept telling them how dangerous it was, how it wasn‚Äôt just some lost gator‚Äîit was something worse.

They said they‚Äôd send someone to investigate, but I knew it was already too late. That thing was still out there.

I don‚Äôt know what it was for sure. But I suspect it was an Australian saltwater crocodile. One of those monsters that‚Äôs been turning up in places it shouldn‚Äôt be, like the Nile crocs people have dumped in the Everglades. Somebody must‚Äôve thought they could make a quick buck or just get rid of a dangerous pet, and now look where we are. Look where *Keith* is.

The thing is, sometimes there‚Äôs a damn good reason why environmental laws are in place. I didn‚Äôt get it before‚Äîthought they were just about being overcautious, or trying to ruin the fun for people who actually care about nature. But now I see it. We‚Äôre messing with something we don‚Äôt understand, and the consequences are real.

I hope to God whoever thought they could release that croc into the Everglades gets what‚Äôs coming to them. They deserve it. No one should have to pay that kind of price for somebody else‚Äôs recklessness.

As for me? I‚Äôm done. No more kayaking out there. No more thinking the Everglades is just another fun trip. I‚Äôve seen what‚Äôs out there now. And I know some things are better left alone.

Keith‚Äôs gone. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever stop hearing the sound of those monkeys screaming.

And that eye. That *damn* eye.

I‚Äôll never forget it.

A few days after Valentine‚Äôs Day in 2023, my old best friend broke up with his girlfriend who was also one of my close friends (I matched them together). Let‚Äôs call him John and her Caroline. John and Caroline loved spending time together and were together for just about 1.5 years at the time of the breakup. 

Both individuals reached out to me to talk about things and both told me NOT to take sides. I agreed and didn‚Äôt take sides. 

Come April 1st and I was still talking to both and made plans with John to go to an Opening Day MLB game to take his mind off things. A few weeks prior, I sat down with his ex at a coffee shop to talk things out with her. 

Come the night before the game and I got hit with a ‚ÄúDo you still talk to Caroline?‚Äù text at almost midnight. I, being a night owl, responded back ‚Äúyeah I do, you two are two of my closest friends, why?‚Äù

And just like that, I was blocked. Blocked on everything except Facebook, which I still think is weird (to this day). 

Flash forward to a few days ago, one of our mutual friends asked me to come hang out with Caroline. I agreed because I haven‚Äôt talked to her in 1.5 years, so I figured it would be nice seeing some of my friends from one of my old friend groups. 

There, they dove into everything. John told Caroline and our friend group about my history. They told me how John told them about how/where I was when I was graped, how I went though a shitty/abusive friendship before the grape, how I tried to run away, how he cheated on Caroline with a girl who was just turned 17 (he was 23 at the time of the breakup), how I‚Äôve struggled with a load insecurities, and so much more. 

Caroline apologized to me and how she wish she told me sooner. I accepted her apology because she too was also lost and confused as to why he acted the way he did. 

As for John, I‚Äôve heard nothing from him. Complete radio silence, which frankly, I‚Äôm thankful for. However, his girlfriend (the one who he cheated on Caroline with) doesn‚Äôt seem to mind me. She always says hi with a smile when she sees me, tried following me on social media, and somehow found my address to my apt to send me a get well soon card after I had surgery (idk how she found this out because we don‚Äôt have any mutuals and John never visited my apartment). 

Now here‚Äôs where I need advice, do I try to make ends meet with him by sending him a ‚ÄúHey buddy, long time no chat, how have you been?‚Äù text OR should I try to strike up conversation with him if I see him in person. Last time I saw him in person, he turned his head the opposite way from me like I wasn‚Äôt even there. I forgive easily (which is one of my red flags), but I love seeing the best in people, no matter who it is (not including my abuser and grapist, lol). 

If you made it this far THANK YOU for reading my long winded story, I‚Äôve been contemplating putting this on here for quite some time, but have been too nervous to do so. ",1,1739459982.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Currently I am writing a fiction short movie script and one of the characters I want to write is non-binary. Because I want the character to stand for the feelings of not belonging in the real world or the ‚Äúfantasy world‚Äù part of my story. They are not the main character. The character is not evil, a victim of society, or the antagonist. They are a side character, and all my characters have at least a full page of background story and personality.

The disclaimer is that I feel very ignorant of the topic and would love for someone to share their experience with me. I am looking for for someone that educates me without preaching.

I am looking for non-binary people to interview. My expectation is to create a fully fledged character that feels real and is respectful. If you are patient and feel like sharing constructively, please reach.

The questions I have go from very basic to spiritual, right now:

a)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Please explain to me what exactly is non-binary for you?

b)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† How to manage respectfully a NB character?

c)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Do you use fashion as a tool?

d)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What make you feel comfortable in a space?

e)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† How would you describe your friendships with people outside of 2SLGTBQITT+ (SORRY IF I wrote it wrong or incomplete)

f)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Is there any graphic or symbol that is relevant to the NB?

g)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Could you give a read to the corresponding part of the script and give feedback?

We could grab a coffee /tea in campus or do a zoom call. Your call!

Please send me a DM if you are interested.

**PS**

More disclaimers, the text of the film will not be political or a societal critique, while all art is political, all my political writings will be in the subtext and demand attention and reflection from the audience.

I like to write about f-ed people dealing with life, sprinkled with a touch of gothic supernatural and mystical mysteries.

¬†

Jane (pseudonym) and I started dating in June 2023 after meeting on a dating app. About 5-6 dates in, she had a change of heart and wanted to break things off. I responded saying that I understood and wished her all the best. Surprisingly, within 24 hours, she reached out again to talk, and after meeting in person, she decided she wanted to give it another try (much time later, she would admit that she was ‚Äúlooking for a reason to stay‚Äù).

¬†

Fast forward to October 2023, when I asked her if she‚Äôd consider exclusivity. She declined and I accepted, and we continued to date as usual.

¬†

Come December 2023, she informs me that she bought a one-way ticket to Mexico for February 2024. Although I knew for a while that she had plans to go to Mexico to work remotely and escape our harsh winters (we‚Äôre in Canada), I still felt insecure about her leaving for a long time without us discussing what exactly we were. So, over breakfast one morning, I asked her what she was looking for and what she wanted from our relationship. I again suggest exclusivity, to which she responded, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference between dating and exclusivity?‚Äù After some further talk, she agreed to being exclusive and got a little emotional from the conversation (she would later ‚Äòjoke‚Äô to her friends and family by referring to this conversation was the ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù).

¬†

The relationship lasted a year (until December 2024), during which time the following happened (some highlights):

¬†

* I went to visit her in Mexico twice (she was gone for a month), during which time she got pregnant. I had to find her a pregnancy test because she couldn‚Äôt be bothered to purchase one and find out herself (in her words, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of knowing now? We‚Äôre in Mexico. We can't do anything about it.‚Äù). After returning home, she wanted to terminate the pregnancy, and I supported her the whole way through. Afterwards though she refused to talk about what happened.
* She was initially still friends with her ex-boyfriend (she still had a photo of the two of them on her fridge, which she took down when she noticed it bothered me). After telling her ex that she was seeing him, he started acting up (demanding more attention, etc.) and she was forced to end that friendship.
* On multiple occasions, she said to me things like, ‚ÄúAre our personalities compatible?‚Äù, or she would admit that she had doubts about us, only to take them back immediately afterwards.
* She was extremely emotional on her period (which she admitted) and would tell me that I had to ""put up"" with it every month (she once had a public emotional breakdown while on vacation because she couldn't find a restaurant that was open).
* She once grabbed coffee with a male friend who she once had a crush on (and slept with). She told me beforehand, but it wasn't her idea to tell me (one of her girlfriends told her that it might be appropriate to let me know).
* She grabbed lunch with a guy at work, assuming it was a recruitment or business lunch. That same guy asked her out for dinner, and she asked me how she should respond to his invitation (rather than just decline it).
* When we started dating, she wasn't in therapy, but decided to go back into it because she was impressed by how dedicated I was to my therapy journey (I've been in it for 10+ years). However, some time later, she told me that she spent every therapy session she had talking about how different her and I were and asking her therapist at what point does she ""keep going"" with the relationship.



Now in all honesty, I had my flaws as well. I have anxiety, sometimes I'm grumpy, I can be overly sensitive, etc. But I'd like to think that I did the best with what I had. I do love her a lot, and when she ended things, I was a bit blindsided.



About 1.5 months after the break-up, I reached out for closure. During that conversation, she said that the reason why she broke up with me was because she was ""unsure of the relationship from the beginning, but that she ignored her concerns, hoping that they would go away on their own."" But after one year, her unsureness was still there, which made her pull the plug. She also divulged that she did love me at one point, but then later didn't anymore, hence why she ""stopped saying it or said it less frequently"".



I guess I'm just looking for some validation from this sub that this breakup is in fact a blessing in disguise for me. Thank you so much for reading!

I came from a broken home where I was so abused and neglected that I was put into foster care with my four younger siblings at four and a half years old. I was bounced from foster to foster and deeply struggled with social and mental health issues and emotional scars grew with each nine months someone else packed me up with nothing but the clothes on my back and drove me without warning somewhere else id be er been to some new people for nine more months. I couldn't keep up with all the changes of schools and learned early not to get attached to anyone. I was so isolated and broken when puberty hit and nobody told me I was ok or that it is normal that I had a complete melt down landing me in a mental hospital for hurting myself. I was rocking back and forth and pulling my hair and teeth out in distress. In the psych ward I was further neglected, over medicated and without anyone to speak on my behalf since foster care hadn't checked on me and ""lost"" me for three years. At least that's what they now explain. 

Then I ran away. 

I didn't even know how to use a telephone, or a phonebook. I didn't have anyone who cared or I knew to call. I didn't have any plans. 

But my mother had done one thing for me. She loved to read.
 She had taught me to read really well. There were always books. I loved readers digest. Even in care I could find a book about something somewhere. But I didn't realize yet the powerful keys to freedom they held within their pages. I was just fed up and thought well other people are happy. I'm going to go find out how to be too. 

On the streets I was raped, beaten, starved and trafficked. Impregnated twice and left for dead on two occasions. We won't get into that. I slept in blood and feces covered no tell hotels if I was lucky or in alleyways or under houses in crawlspaces or on rooftops where I could defend myself sleeping. I ate at soup kitchens.

Then after years and years of this...I was given hope. I married a con. Straight outta prison and ready to show me a better life. Haha. With his help I got a job, a stable home and had a man who loved me. Turns out he was bisexual. I couldn't handle competing with men for my own husband. But He showed me love, something is never known. He taught me self love, and how to survive this crazy, challenging world. 

My birth mother is in terrible shape and one of my younger sisters has, as an adult moved in with her, providing round the clock care while raising her own four children and four step children in Aberdeen. She can't understand my difficulties and challenges in society, and I can't understand hers. We don't talk about our challenges and difficulties. We just sit quietly together sipping coffee and finding occasional sister giggles at something only we find funny and hug each others tears away and be the one person who neither of us owes an explanation to. The house full of racing children and loud awkward noises of their presence.The one person we can unapologetically be ourselves with. (I even baby sit Sometimes) Sometimes we vent to each other, with a full understanding that listening, even though you cannot relate to the others crushing struggles is powerfully healing. Necessary. I found love and resilience in the least likely places, with deep connections and meaningful support right where I was in life. 
 
Point of this is... If you find a natural support, in the few, cherish, relish, forgive yourself and accept life as it is...then heck yeah and things will get easier. It's outlook, and patiently overcoming. Surviving with hope. That's what ushers in better days!

Now for the malicious compliance, 

Recently, my mom usually goes into the kitchen and get her mug for coffee, but one of the volunteers came up to her and said that she wasn't allowed to go into the kitchen because she wasn't a volunteer. Well, since my mom wasnt allowed in the kitchen, she would do one of two things, 

1) She would tell someone to get like a coffee pot from the kitchen, they get the coffee pot, and she's like ""I can't make coffee without the coffee filter"" instead of telling someone all at once. 
 
2) She would tell person 1 to get one thing and person 2 for another thing involving that same task to make the other person feel useful.

As someone who can‚Äôt get through the day without a chilled coffee on hand, this compact and elegant coffee maker was a welcome addition to my kitchen. From the first use, I could tell that this wasn‚Äôt just another gadget destined to gather dust.

The Hario Mizudashi is crafted from heatproof glass, with a simple yet sturdy design that feels both modern and functional. It holds 600ml, which is roughly two to three servings of coffee‚Äîperfect for personal use or sharing with a friend. The brown color gives it a warm, earthy aesthetic that blends seamlessly with most kitchen decors. I was particularly impressed by the inclusion of a reusable nylon filter, a thoughtful feature that eliminates the need for disposable paper filters. Not only does this make it eco-friendly, but it also saves a few bucks over time.

Using it was straightforward. I followed the recommended method: adding medium-coarse coffee grounds to the filter, pouring in water slowly, and letting it steep in the fridge for about 12 hours. The slender spout makes pouring the finished coffee remarkably easy, avoiding those annoying drips that some coffee makers seem to favor. I appreciated the dishwasher-safe design, as cleaning it was a breeze, even on lazy mornings.

[Check Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-cold-brew-coffee-maker-hario-mizudashi-review-b00ij3o0y2/)

The taste of the coffee it brewed was rich and smooth, with significantly less acidity compared to hot brewing methods. I noticed how the flavor highlighted the natural sweetness of the beans, which made my usual sugar and milk additions almost unnecessary. My partner, who typically can't stand the bitterness of coffee, ended up loving the cold brew this maker produced. It was a hit during a recent family brunch, where even my picky cousin admitted it was ""shockingly good.""

However, not everything was perfect. The instructions included were entirely in Japanese, which could be a hurdle for first-time users. Luckily, I found some translated guides online, but not having clear instructions in the package was slightly inconvenient. Additionally, the 600ml capacity might feel limiting for anyone who needs a larger batch, say, for a busy household or frequent hosting. Another minor issue is that while the filter is reusable, it does take some effort to clean thoroughly‚Äîespecially if you let it sit too long after brewing.

**Pros**

* Sleek, compact design that fits easily in the fridge.
* Produces smooth, low-acidity coffee with natural sweetness.
* Includes a reusable nylon filter, eliminating the need for disposable ones.
* Dishwasher-safe, making cleanup relatively simple.
* Affordable and a great entry point into cold brewing.

**Cons**

* Limited 600ml capacity may not suffice for larger households.
* Instructions are in Japanese, which could confuse new users.
* Cleaning the filter requires some attention and effort.
* Not ideal for those who prefer stronger coffee concentrations without experimentation.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other cold brew coffee makers, like the Toddy or Bodum French Press, the Hario Mizudashi holds its ground well. The Toddy is better suited for larger batches but is bulkier and harder to store. While the Bodum French Press doubles as a hot coffee maker, it lacks the same focus on cold brewing and can result in a messier cleanup. The Mizudashi's dedicated cold brew design makes it a more elegant solution for smaller households or individuals. It excels in simplicity and flavor clarity, which is why I keep reaching for it over other options.

One area where the Mizudashi could improve is its capacity, especially when compared to larger systems like the Oxo Cold Brew Coffee Maker. However, its compact size is also a strength‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt hog counter or fridge space like some of its competitors. If you're looking for a balance between function and form, the Mizudashi is a standout choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While I can‚Äôt mention the exact price, I find the cost of the Hario Mizudashi reasonable for what it offers. Considering its durable glass construction, reusable filter, and the quality of coffee it produces, it feels like a solid investment. For those who regularly purchase cold brew at coffee shops, this little device could pay for itself in just a few weeks. Plus, the eco-friendly filter eliminates the need for ongoing purchases of paper filters‚Äîa small but impactful saving.

If you're hesitant about the upfront cost, remember that you're investing in convenience and a consistent cold brew experience. In comparison to pricier cold brew systems, the Mizudashi offers a more affordable way to enjoy caf√©-quality coffee at home.

1iol2c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1iol2c6/photon_chapter_1_going_nowhere/,[Photon] - Chapter 1 - Going Nowhere,"I stared out the window as my slow-speaking professor droned on with something... I wasn't paying attention. My eyelids felt heavy, and I almost slammed my head on the desk when they closed. Just as I was about to drift off into a lovely dream, my professor said something that actually piqued my interest.

""The Photon was developed by the Helios corporation around 50 years ago introducing the world to hard-light technology. When it was first conceived it could only make rudimentary holograms of a few shapes. The actual machine was around the size of a refrigerator and was considered a novelty by many, and too expensive for everyone else.

However, Helios kept developing it believing in its untapped potential. Over time they refined the system and reduced its size exponentially. The real breakthrough was when Helios successfully linked the Photon with the human brain. This link allowed the brain to directly control the Photon, drastically increasing its versatility. Rapid success soon followed for Helios and their technology became more and more widespread. Today, nearly eight in ten people have a Photon installed in their head.""

The Photon. A seemingly limitless device embedded in the back of your skull. It manipulated the light in the surroundings to your will. I couldn't have been happier when I got one installed a few years ago.

The first day I had the Photon I played with it enough to give me a migraine. I was always looking for new uses for it. At first, I could only make static objects like tables, chairs, and silverware. Eventually, as my understanding of it increased, I was able to make clothes out of light, though they were far from comfortable. Eventually, I even made a functioning bike that I still use to get around.

""... that concludes the exposition,"" the professor said. 

Exposition? That didn't seem right. I realized I must've been lost in my thoughts again. He probably said explanation or something. That made more sense. 

As the professor wrapped up his lecture, I stuffed my things into my backpack and headed to the cafeteria. Like always, I scanned my card at the entrance to pay. The scanner let out an annoying beep. Card declined. The cashier had a cheerful look to her that was almost mocking. I tried my card again. Beep. Card declined. ""Maybe there's something wrong with the scanner?"" I asked with a faint hope in my heart. 

""It seems that there's no money left on your account,"" the lady replied with a smile. 

""No money? That's not poss-"" I stopped myself when I realized that I might really be broke. All that money I came in with my first year was gone. It was supposed to at least last the rest of my second year. I knew buying all of those overpriced lattes at the campus coffee shop would come back to bite me.

With an empty wallet and emptier stomach, I trudged back to my room. With my current pile of snacks, I'd be fine for a few days at least, but after that? I'd need cash. Fast. I knew there was only one thing that could save me from my predicament. I despised the very thought of it, but it had to be done. I needed a job.

Problem was, I've never been the hardworking type. With the least amount of effort possible, I searched for the easiest way to land a job. It didn't take long to find a site that promised to send my resume to local businesses‚Äîno matter what kind of work they did. Perfect. The shotgun approach. If I applied to enough places, someone was bound to hire me.

I threw together a resume in about half an hour and included some ""creative"" attributes of myself like being hardworking and sociable. For work experience, I even listed ""Photon researcher."" It sounded impressive enough. I submitted my resume to the website and waited for the job offers to come rolling in.

And waited.

And waited some more.

Finally, I received a notification. I opened it immediately. The position? ""Information Examiner."" Never heard of it, but it sounded official. There was no actual description of the job‚Äîmaybe they just figured that it was self-explanatory. The address was listed but the actual business was never given a name anywhere. At the bottom was a note: We'll take anyone at this point. Finish the interview, and the job is yours.

Wait. Finish? Why specify that? The more I reread the offer, the sketchier it started to look. No name, no details ... I felt like I was being catfished. I decided to wait for a better offer. 

Two days later, not a single offer since, and my supply of snacks was running dangerously low. This wasn't a time to be picky. It was a time to be desperate. I looked at the sketchy email again. My mind screamed, Don't go. You'll end up dead in a ditch somewhere. My stomach said otherwise. I put together an outfit that had a semblance of business casual and started heading to the address listed on the email. It was time for an interview.

1iol1xt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1iol1xt/holstein_hh0914701r_coffee_maker_review_a_compact/,Holstein HH-0914701R Coffee Maker Review: A Compact and Stylish Brew Companion,"The Holstein HH-0914701R Coffee Maker has become my go-to appliance for brewing coffee each morning. Its vibrant red design immediately caught my eye, adding a cheerful splash of color to my otherwise neutral kitchen. I‚Äôve been testing this coffee maker for about a month now, and while it has its pros and cons, it‚Äôs definitely an interesting product for those seeking functionality in a small package.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This coffee maker is compact and lightweight, making it ideal for small kitchens or tight countertop spaces. The red finish is bold and eye-catching, and its durable plastic housing feels solid enough for daily use. The borosilicate glass carafe is a nice touch, but I did notice it feels a bit thin, so handling it with care is important. However, the overall build is sleek and doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúbudget appliance,‚Äù which is a relief.

**Brewing Performance**  
Performance-wise, the Holstein coffee maker delivers a decent cup of coffee. It brews quickly, which is a lifesaver during hectic mornings, and the coffee comes out hot and flavorful. The auto-pause function allows me to sneak a cup mid-brew without making a mess‚Äîperfect for impatient coffee lovers like me. That being said, it‚Äôs not as consistent as premium machines; the strength of the coffee varies slightly depending on the grind and amount used.

[Click here to see the price](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/holstein-hh-0914701r-coffee-maker-review-b077v3ky8x/).

**Customization & Controls**  
The controls are pretty straightforward‚Äîjust a single button to start and stop the brewing process. While simplicity is great for some, there‚Äôs no option to tweak things like coffee strength or temperature. For those who enjoy control over their brew, this might feel limiting. However, for someone like my cousin, who just wants a no-fuss coffee maker, it‚Äôs perfect.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this coffee maker is foolproof. The water level indicator on the side is clearly marked, so I never overfill. The included permanent filter means I don‚Äôt have to stock up on paper filters, though I personally prefer the taste when using paper ones. My coworker borrowed it for a weekend and found it intuitive enough to use without even referencing the manual.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning this coffee maker is a breeze. The filter basket is removable and easy to rinse, and the carafe cleans up nicely with soap and water. Descaling the machine is straightforward too, though I haven‚Äôt needed to do that yet. One small downside is the lack of a self-cleaning function, which some pricier models include.

**Capacity & Size**  
This is a 5-cup coffee maker, which I find perfect for my morning routine. It‚Äôs ideal for individuals or small households, though it might not be the best option for entertaining guests. Its compact size means it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which is always a plus in my tiny kitchen.

**Pros**

* Compact and space-saving design.
* Vibrant red color adds personality to any kitchen.
* Quick brewing time with an auto-pause feature for convenience.
* Includes a permanent filter, saving money on disposable ones.
* Easy to clean with removable parts.

**Cons**

* The glass carafe feels fragile and requires careful handling.
* No customization options for coffee strength or temperature.
* Slight inconsistency in coffee taste depending on grind and measurements.
* Lacks advanced features like a self-cleaning mode.
* The cord is a bit short, limiting placement flexibility.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Against competitors like the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Coffee Maker, the Holstein HH-0914701R holds its own with its bold design and compact size. The Mr. Coffee model, however, offers a sturdier carafe and slightly more consistent brewing, making it a better choice for those prioritizing durability. On the other hand, the Holstein‚Äôs vibrant color options and included permanent filter give it an edge in style and eco-friendliness. Compared to the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffee Maker, the Holstein is more visually appealing but lacks the programmable timer feature that Black+Decker provides. If simplicity and aesthetics are your primary concerns, the Holstein wins; for functionality, its competitors may have the upper hand.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
The price point is reasonable for what the Holstein HH-0914701R offers. It‚Äôs not a high-end coffee maker, but it doesn‚Äôt claim to be. For its compact size, decent brewing performance, and stylish appearance, it‚Äôs a good deal. If you‚Äôre looking for a basic machine that gets the job done without breaking the bank, this one‚Äôs worth considering. However, if you‚Äôre someone who demands advanced features, you may want to invest in a pricier model.

Overall, the Holstein HH-0914701R Coffee Maker is a solid choice for those in search of a compact, budget-friendly appliance with a pop of color. While it‚Äôs not perfect, its user-friendly design and reliable performance make it a worthwhile addition to a small kitchen setup.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It was 7th grade, and soon she became the reason for me coming to school‚Ä¶ I used to play cricket, and even though I wouldn‚Äôt check who was looking at me at the time, I was hoping she was catching some glances. Two girls came to shake my hand, not that I wanted to, and I was seeing her checking it as if she was annoyed. Her frequencies increased; now I was in deep spirit ‚Äì as if I now realised I was in something I always anathematized ‚Äì devotion. She sang happy birthday for me, though other girls did. I, with my reserved nature, felt astoundingly intrigued by her. 

I came to school on the date I still celebrate intrinsically; I sat, and I know I wouldn‚Äôt check their faces. I still knew someone was wearing a dress that was not in uniform. I wished it was her ‚Äì and yes, it was her‚Ä¶ It was her birthday, and when I saw her, it was when I truly believed she was the serenity that I wanted to sink in this bliss of relish. However, all I said was thanks, even though her clothes touched mine, igniting a spark in my heart. 
‚Äò[My full name] ‚Ä¶ can you switch on the fan?‚Äô Everyone was there; class was going on, the season of winter, yet out of oblivion she called my name without any furnace to switch on the fan‚Ä¶ I saw her face, her eyes, that beauty truly propelled‚Ä¶ What did I even do‚Ä¶ nothing but mundane‚Ä¶ Yes, I was always reticent and bashful‚Ä¶ coward

A year and a half passed away; I didn‚Äôt forget her, though, but we never talked during that period. 14 December it was when I learnt I would see her again; I wasn‚Äôt sure how it would turn out, but I was fervently nervous at all. I went to the classroom, seeing no juveniles but only demoiselles, as I scrolled. I saw her, but I was crushed upon the idea of shyness; I couldn‚Äôt even look at her, and as if my feelings were fading away‚Äîat least I told myself to run away from her. But soon she came to, no, I did,
and then she came again and talked to me. Again, that sweet voice, as if she was telling me to talk. I felt nice, and my feelings returned again, but again I never called her name. I and a cohort were alone; she came with her friend and asked, ‚ÄòCan you go outside?‚Äô As if she didn‚Äôt want me to go but wanted me to stay with her alone‚Ä¶ but I went away‚Ä¶ and that day, 16th December, we could have been consummated if I had not been an unsophisticated coward‚Ä¶ but I still cherished that day. 

Next grade came, she again approached me. We used to play together, and she was on my team, but I couldn‚Äôt say. Waiting for the moment, which was never there, became my nightmare. I wrote a letter that I believe (now) was phenomenal, but I tore it away thinking I would make a laugh‚Ä¶ of myself, who deserved to be mocked. 

Soon, we became distant; oh, was there ever a connection that was not transient? She saw no one of me, and I of her, as if we were never truly for each other. I used to wonder what happened because if there was nothing, then why did she use to call me so often? I became sick, fell ill, and when I came back, I knew I was wrong. She had a leman, a partner all along, and it was not me. I knew with the glance the fellow was hers‚Ä¶ where did it go wrong, I wondered. Well, it was incorrect from the start, and it pondered me with the blast. Why did she choose him who just approached her suddenly? I couldn‚Äôt say he was an ugly, grotesque, though everyone did. Those eyes, which used to provide nourishment and flourishment, were now felt sickly scorned, and I couldn‚Äôt do anything but mourn‚Ä¶ The person who I wanted to see me being her hero, and now she doesn‚Äôt like me, did she ever like me? I used to seek no one but her, and she chose someone as if I was a scar. I, now, wanted her not to love me back but to know whether she ever loved me or not ‚Äì I was tormented by the thought of revealing my feelings for her, not to get closer but to get closure‚Ä¶ I saw her face; we were alone there, as if she wanted to tell me she was ashamed, but I did was run ‚Äì which I always did from the only person I ever loved‚Ä¶ 

I wrote letters, but I tore them away; all I wanted was to know if she ever loved me or not‚Ä¶ but was it worth it, I thought. Even if she did, yet she still chose someone who I was not‚Ä¶ if this love was any equal? There‚Äôs no veracity to it, but my heart betrayed me, saying I was above her because I was better than her. In reality, I was the worst and a degenerate coward. But all I wanted to know was if she ever loved me or not‚Ä¶

2 years passed away; I woke up one night; no popsy truly affected me other than her sight! She was what I wanted; she was what I dreamt of. I became better, yet I was crestfallen, sad, and lugubriously mad because my life was incomplete, thinking about the only greet, but I know I was a freak. I knew I couldn‚Äôt be with anyone else other than her, but I also just wanted to know whether she loved me or not. I didn‚Äôt want her but her answer, because I was hoping for not closer but closure. If she says no ‚Äì god I win; I will not be the coward anymore; I will get the closure I ever wished for. 
However, if she says yes, then I will cry and ask her what went pretty wrong. For all I know, I just wanted an answer.



Waiting for the time, I thought I would build myself up to the shore, so that I could have the audacity to address the message I always wished to press. All I did was focus on myself, but my mind was fixated on her‚Ä¶ I knew someone else, probably more than one, but someone else liked me, but all I did was run because I only wanted one ‚Äì and not even one, but the answer, a validation. Years passed away, and I knew I wanted to know, but I believed I should get a job; I ignored all, for something I never had at all‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòShould I message her now?‚Äô But where is she? I never knew; her whereabouts were undivulged for all I skewed. Still, I was chasing her ‚Äì no, the answer, a one, that was validation. I was older, but I knew I would only want her. 

Another two years passed; I was now superfluous, and all I should have done was to seek her. ‚ÄòIs this enough? Is this the time? Maybe I should do more so that she will see that I have flowed and not flawed.‚Äô I was besotted by the idea of not even reconciliation but the answer, a one, validation. Years passed away; I was now blossomed. I waited and waited to become something I was never‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòIs this time?‚Äô All I could think was that I needed an answer, one validation. 

Now, I had the allure, wealth, and a transcendent view because I finally decided to see her and tell her, not to be mine but to get the answer I always mined, to know whether she loved or not, not to get closer but closure because I hoped she would say no, so that I could be free in glee, and that was all her answer, one, validation.
I knew where she lived; I paid to find her, and I knew I was going to her. I went; I knew she would come at the coffee shop, as the men said she often did. I sat there, hoping she would, and we would meet after too long. Now I wasn‚Äôt hoping for the answer but reconciliation, as if we could finally be together, that we could formulate this consummate caress. I was reading a book there, though I could read the words conjointly adjourned her‚Ä¶
She came but not alone, her baby, husband, and her allure. I didn‚Äôt know she was married; I didn‚Äôt know she birthed a baby. They looked cherished, delighted; the look at her face propagated wallowing serenity that I always wanted to peruse incessantly.
I didn‚Äôt say anything; I descried them from far away. Suddenly, I stood up and ran and ran and ran‚Ä¶ how I wanted her to be with me, how now I again ran without even getting the answer, one, validation that I always endeared. I ran and ran‚Ä¶ 

And here I am, all by myself, lost in the thoughts. Seeing her blissful made me chuckle and melancholily numb. I ran away; I wanted to go back, but I knew she was beauteously plausible without me; I couldn‚Äôt bear to obstruct her happiness. I am not that monstrous. 

I knew she would never be on my side; we would not have our hands together for all I might. She was all my imagination; she was never mine. We could have been one, but I knew I would never know if she loved me; I will never get that one validation‚Ä¶",0,1739458588.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.33,False

When adding a second to 23:59:59, an unexpected overflow in the time system occurred, causing the world to fall off from the standard time track. Simply put, the world failed to move from yesterday to tomorrow and has landed in null hour.

You, who are now reading this, are the only human being awake.

People around you may seem normal. However, the truth is, their conscious minds have receded into a sound sleep. It is their subconscious minds that are in the drivers' seat.

As the only human being with your conscious mind awake, it is your responsibility to end Silent Night.

Before you panic at the pressure this responsibility brings, allow me to calm you:

This isn't the first time the world has gone through Silent Night. There have been hundreds of Silent Nights that passed silently while you were asleep. Follow the guide strictly, and the world will pull through this Silent Night as well.



\[ Guide to Silent Night \]

1. Only you wish for Silent Night to end. Others are eager to purge the one with a conscious mind awake‚Äîthe one who attemps to end Silent Night.
2. While Silent Night lasts, there is no sunrise. You are not supposed to mention it.
3. Do not fall asleep. Once you do, you will not be able to wake up again, as your subconscious mind will take full control over you.
4. Keep conversations with anyone under 10 minutes. Remember, their subconscious minds control them. It is safe to say they act like Hyde from *Jekyll and Hyde*. The conversation will escalate into something highly violent, from which you won't walk away safely.
5. You can get yourself some coffee, but make sure to check if the one you are buying is the *unconventional* kind. While Silent Night lasts, coffee is decaffeinated by default.
6. If you find a note written ""Jekyll"", immediately bail out. The hunt will begin soon. You should be at least 3 km far away from the spot.
7. If the song, Silent Night is heard, do not move, make no noise, and hide somewhere if possible. The hunt is on in your zone.
8. During Silent Night, ""*silentnighthascome.com*"" will be open to the public. Sign in with your Google account and check your identity status next to your name occasionally. The identity should be Hyde. If it changes to Jekyll, it means your identity has been disclosed. You have good reason to hide.
9. Whenever you sign in to ""*silentnighthascome.com*"", you must at least leave one comment or post on their forum. But never reply back if someone leaves a comment.
10. ""*silentnighthascome.com*"" is a highly addictive internet community full of topics and news that will leave you flabbergasted. You should not, however, use the site for more than an hour. They dox heavy users.
11. The length of Silent Night ranges from 1 hour to 3 days. When Silent Night ends, ""*silentnighthascome.com*"" will no longer be accessible. Take that as a sign of your unburdening.
12. Even after Silent Night ends, you must not speak of it. Subconscious minds always keep their ears open beneath the surface. If they find out you stopped the last Silent Night, they will come for you first the next Silent Night.
13. If Silent Night lasts longer than 3 days, yet ""*silentnighthascome.com*"" is still accessible, it means you have failed. Get some sleep. The next time you wake up, you won't be *you*. Wait for the next Silent Night to come as a subconscious mind, silently, beneath the surface.

Hope to see you tomorrow.

1iokp92,https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/1iokp92/everything_about_palm_both_in_universe_and_in_a/,"Everything about Palm, both in universe and in a meta sense, is exceedingly odd.","Yesterday I posted a thread simply asking about the strangeness of an enhancer of all things having clairvoyance and remote seeing powers of all things, which severely stretch what you could do with the regular nen categories and at least to me seem like they should be square fits into specialist.

So I want to talk about the ways that Palm is probably the strangest character in HxH, now I have no idea why any of this is the way it is, I have no theory as for a reason, just mere observation.

1) Her powers are exceedingly unusual for a non-specialist and the fact that the story goes out of its way to point out she's an enhancer, the most ""basic"" category, makes this extra odd.

In chapter 201, after she calles Biscuit to train the boys, its strongly implied her power allowed her to somehow obtain that information, that she was her teacher, despite having no clue to it.

This is functionally divination:

>The art or act of foretelling future events or revealing occult knowledge by means of augury or an alleged supernatural agency. 

You know whose other power falls into this definition? Neon Nostrade's, a specialist.

Then in chapter 220 she feeds the mermaid crystal ball some blood, asks a question and gets remote vision on the target. How in the heck is this not specialization?

Then in 252 it seems like her power has been at least partially retconned, going from being able to obtain information about Bisky's existence to just remote viewing that requires her to see someone. Less out there than divination but still strange, what's exactly going on here? is she emitting some nen that acts like a camera and follows her targets around? what's up with the blood and mermaid?

Why something so unusual on a enhancer?

And then Knov makes a comment about her blood being a valuable resource. Not her nen, not her nen ability, not herself, her blood.

Something is being hinted at her, a new nen ""mechanic"" where some people have inherent, nen related powers, yet somehow separate from the regular nen?

And when she transforms into an ant, she develops a sort of imbued crystal ball? but the blood element seems gone?

No idea what's going on here, what I can say is that Togashi specifically did the following things:

I) Made sure we knew Palm is an enhancer with the coffee thing.

II) Originally gave her a power that can only be compared to Neon's.

III) Seemingly later retconned it to ""just"" remote viewing that at least I personally don't feel can be explained by the regular nen categories, if her ability stated that she conjures an invisible nen construct following people and recording them, ok I can see at least an idea of how that works, but no, its just remote viewing because.

IV) Put weird focus into her blood as being valuable and the mermaid.

And the strangest thing of this all, this strangeness all goes away if he simply makes Palm a specialist, which changes nothing else from the story. Just very, very strange.

2) Her character is basically two very different characters for seemingly no reason.

The first iteration of Palm we meet is essentially a gag character, a horror trope, the crazy, murderous, love spurn girl. 

And then she falls for a teenage boy.

And she only gets back into control when the older authority figure in her life comes back and tells her to pipe down.

We could discuss some the issues with a character like this but whatever, like her or hate her, she's what she is.

But then we get an almost entirely different person that took over Palm's body.

We get a quiet, determined, dutiful badass that volunteers to go into the lion's den just to get a chance for something that could help a bit during the invasion.

She's calmed, collected, effective and even goes for suicide when she's discovered to try and avoid being interrogated or otherwise used.

When she wakes up as an ant, some of older personality is present, with her obsession with Gon but through sheer force of will, this Palm breaks Pitou's conditioning and then proceeds to act like a wise adult, saying some of the most heartful and meaningful lines to Killua regarding Gon.

Then she becomes a useful team member and she's a key emotional part of the most emotional and climatic scene in the entire freaking story, when Meruem goes to spend his dying moments with Komugi.

How the fuck did we go from bizarre, embarrassing gag character to *this*?

And why?

I'm sure some could say it was character development. Sure, during a few weeks and entirely out of screen? did she get ultra nen therapy or something?

Anyway, I have no idea why there's so much strangeness about Palm but there sure is quite a bit.",10,1739458197.0,HunterXHunter,6,1.0,False

During the first six months of our marriage, due to financial reasons my husband and I had to stay with my husbands parents. I was in the phase of a career transition and was unemployed. My husband was laid off from his job and it was also the middle of the pandemic. I found it extremely uncomfortable and suffocated staying there. I feel like it was my husbands responsibility to make me feel comfortable, if not by actions but at least with kind words. He did help initially for a few days but the days after that he would just be in his room napping. I was thrown into a completely different life than I was used to. I was living by myself independently before marriage. So it was very difficult for me stay there but I was very nice to his parents and did things I never did for my own parents like putting their laundry out for drying and cooking and washing dishes and making tea or coffee for them. I was very clear to my husband about I felt about traditional marriages and traditional roles in marriages, before we got married. I thought he understood that. I tried to understand the situation as much as I can but there used to be days where I would let my frustration out on my husband by being grumpy and being in a bad mood. I couldn‚Äôt be open with him about my feelings at the time because I didn‚Äôt want to sound like I was complaining. I have apologised for the way I was there at the time a hundred times.

We did it with condom last time so I'm safe naman. Living around qc and willing to travel din.

I have no preference as long as you're a female, nice and willing to teach me in bed (since I have little to no experience pa) I'm good with that.

I'm also down for long term fwb setup and I can be also be your travel, coffee, gaming and concert buddy. I'm not forcing anyone since I'm not confident with my height.

Vanillary: I tried it for the first time last night. It‚Äôs so sweet. Too sweet for me. It‚Äôs straight sugar, strong vanilla, and white florals. It actually reminds me of (one of my favorites) Kilian Kissing but more sugary and not as smooth. Honestly, I think I might give this to a friend. 

Jimmy Choo Fever: I tried this about a year ago based on a recommendation. I love the plum and coffee combo. It‚Äôs rich, deep, and sexy. Great option if you like scents like Black Opium. 

Lanc√¥me Tr√©sor: This was one of my go-to scents years ago and have more recently wanted it back in my collection. It‚Äôs such a soft, soapy, lightly peachy floral. Totally underrated.

She wouldn't find our clothes laid out to her dismay
She'd tear through my closet for something stylish and comfy
Pair it with matching socks and kitschy jewelry 
She'd give me a headband or butterfly clips for my hair
Then she'd search for a purse and take off down the stairs
She'd expect fluffy pancakes or Rice Krispies to eat
And be horrified instead when I reach for coffee

In the car we'd still blast Hilary Duff
She'd want her arm out the window while I keep the windows up
We'd move through the day making up stories as we go
Mine more structured and hers go with the flow
Her skin would be tan from all her time in the sun
I'd be jealous of her endless creativity and fun

We'd gab forever about nothing if given the opportunity
But she'd start by telling me about her pool party 
All her friends were there and fun memories were made
Our favorite part was definitely the ""Lilo and Stitch"" cake
I'd show her my tattoos and star shaped nose ring
She'd scream with joy and ask about who we're dating
I'd gush about my girlfriend and she'd smile with glee
I'd tell her about my friends and how I've never been so happy

She'd flash a toothy grin and then attempt a pirouette
She'd grab my hands and encourage me to make an attempt
We'd prep, twirl and fall, laughing as we go
Making up a spunky dance routine and putting on a show
We'd play with our stuffed animals and take a snack break
She'd try to race me, I'd laugh and then make a silly face 
We'd pick weeds to make bracelets and then climb up a tall tree
She'd remind me it's okay to sit still and just breathe 

We'd watch the sunset and then catch fireflies 
Go inside and make our dinner of chicken tenders and fries 
We'd watch ""Anastasia"" and sing every line
I'd apologize for being off key and she'd smile and say ‚ÄúThat's fine‚Äù
Before bed we'd journal and pick a new book to begin
But we wouldn't be able to sleep so we'd go stargazin‚Äô

We'd talk about our hopes, dreams and fears
With empathy and kindness, we'd listen through tears
I'd give her a big hug and tell her that she's safe
Free to live her life for her and move at her own pace 
We'd talk about the past, present and future
Things I'd forgotten and some surprises for her
She'd be confused to discover we're not a Ballet Dancer
Or Detective, Astronaut, or even a Baker
She'd say ‚ÄúAs long as you're happy‚Äù and I'd turn to her and say 
‚ÄúThat's something I'm still working on each and every day‚Äù

The following evening she was curled up in my lap again and my husband walked by us to come sit down. She growled at him so he backed away from her to heed her warning, and she lunged and tried to bite him again anyway.

(Famous last words),"Well here's an update to my previous post - 3 months later. I had originally posted looking for advice. Yuppers... Bad news bears



See here for the og post https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/s/tWENkhUo4Z

Well, things have been going awesome, we've reconnected and our marriage is in a better place. 

Ha, 

Not even close. Here's story time if you're willing to read, cause it's a doozy and probably more of a vent. Or skip to the tldr and judge away. Are there details missing probably, can I elaborate on anything. Most definitely. Will I be brutally honest. Yup. 

We went to marriage counseling. 4 or 5 sessions. Got some strategies and things to work on. She refused to do any of them. Refused to try. And some of them were fairly simple things. 

I compare it to a doctor telling you need to do x,y,x and there's a chance you'll get better. But if you don't do ANYTHING,dead in the water. Could things still end up dead in the water 100% and I said as much. I pointed this out. She didn't care, last session she said she wanted a separation. 
Devastated would be an understatement. 

Two days later (around Christmas time)I catch her crying, just losing it. I try to comfort her, she breaks down telling me she made a mistake. Doesn't want to separate. I agree because well I'm still in love with her. I'm more than still in love with her. I would do anything to make this work. 

More importantly I was willing to try, maybe it wouldn't work out, but I'd never look back on that part of my life and say I didn't try. Or we both tried and it just wasn't happening. I'd definitely be devastated still, or maybe I'd realize that it wasn't going to work. Who's to say and maybe I'm just telling myself that now.

So I said okay. Things are good, we go on a family vacation, things are good. We're reconnecting, things are good. She was trying and I saw it. It felt so so good. Was it everything that I wanted. No. Was it baby steps to something it sure felt like it. And I mean baby steps. She even suggested we go on a trip together. I was blown away, but kept it slow, suggesting ideas to reconnect. Decided to take a step back from counseling (her idea). I said we could do that for a month.  Step away from her own counselor. But I stated I was going to continue with my own counselor. Because I legitimately think it's helping. 

But I was clear that if it felt like things were digressing or she felt that way, I wanted to go back to try to get some help immediately. 

Then things got bad again. Nothing in particular happened. She just stopped trying again. Like stopped. Maybe it was a month, it was probably less.

Things I left out on the previous post. Mainly because even though this is the internet I was embarrassed, and to be honest still embarrassed  (maybe someone reading this will see their own life in this, and relate, or just laugh at me *shrug*) was she was having an emotional affair, (when she originally broke the news that she felt like we were roommates).

She broke that off. I believed her. Even with the whole ""not trying thing"" I still believe her... Why you ask... Cause I'm an idiot (you'll see the trend). 

Well when they got bad again. She again said she wanted a separation. 

I actually caught her (again embarassing but full disclosure) coming out of a van in a parking lot. It was like fate made it happen, wish I could say I was actually following her but I was rebuilding trus, and it just happened. 

 Called her on it, because I was furious (duh), and she said that she was""talking with someone about separation"" (that went through this and eventually got back with their spouse) and didn't want to talk about this in say a coffee shop where someone could overhear about how she was going to leave her husband. Writing it out makes me realize how much of an idiot I am. Again, maybe someone else will read this and realize they're not alone (or that's what I'm telling myself now). 

Guess what I believed her... Still kind of do, but again it doesn't really matter.

Notice a trend lol. (I can at least laugh at myself now). 

 Had a huge blow up. I said some hurtful things... truthful things but not with any tact. Guess what I was hurt after seeing the above. Specifically things like she was so hyper focused on the family and kids before and now hyper focused on herself and there was zero, zip balance, neglecting the kids for example. Her own mother said it to me which was shocking.  She was being completely selfish. Which I understood or told myself I did at least (she was still trying to figure things out - wasn't doing anything for herself before and now herself was the only thing that mattered), but we needed to find a balance for the family (and perhaps us.)

Anyways separation talk. 

She said that, there was a chance of us working things out, but I needed to work on myself, (she'd said that before) but she didn't want to go on the journey with me. Which I hadn't heard before, but I actually understood much clearer and better.  Or wanted to understand (see me above saying how much I'm still in love with her, and my ongoing trend of just overlooking huge red flags). 

I asked her right to her face during the ""journey talk"" was there someone else, because I can't compete with someone else. If she's putting in that emotional effort with someone, I'm not going to be able to compete with that if she's giving me nothing. She just looked me in the face and said no.

 Ooo look the trend. 

We hadn't had a talk yet about the logistics on the separation. Had a big family trip planned in an month (not the one mentioned above)  before this all blew up, money already spent. Impossible to not do. And more importantly it was for the kids so they'd be devastated. 

I decided to take a step back, make it through this vacation, keep working on myself blah blah blah (I am doing those things just yadda yaddaing them...

Figured I could survive for a month, especially for the kids. 

Told her to sleep in another room and then weakly took it back, still living in la la land. (Yesh what an idiot.)

 Figure out the logistics of separation afterwards. 

 I try to be a decent human being at home. Not vengeful, supportive, understanding of what she'd said. Figure I'll be amicable until we figure the logistics out. We've got two young kids, our lives will be intertwined no matter how I want things to turn out. 

She does some things that help her mentally reset. Helps her show up better for the family. Which I was actually making happen because I realized it helped her and was hoping that we would find a balance. And that might help in the future for well everything. 

 But after I said those things about her being selfish etc.. (in my least tactful way), she felt guilt about wanting to do her activity. Kids were home sick and she didn't want to dump the kids on her mom. She was working from home, she's not a SAHM. I let her vent to me, and asked if she was looking to vent or wanted a possible solution. And she said she'd like a solution. So I came home from work early to watch the kids. Let her go out do her thing. I knew it would be good for her as she hadn't been able to do it due to the weather being so shitty and it had been weeks and she loves doing it. Knew that overall things would be more amicable at home. She even hugged me when I got in the door and thanked me for coming home. 

But you know that feeling, that suspicion you get because with everything it just didn't seem to add up. Because I was living in a fantasy land of us getting back together (I had it even with all my overlooking of the red flags, that I didn't see until now.) 

When she left, I checked her computer. Pictures, sharing of calendars with a guy (obviously so she could coordinate BS). Left the pictures on the computer. 

She saw it after we sat down for dinner and confronted her. I wanted to blow up but she was gone for 2 hours so it was actually good for me. I felt dead inside, just talked calmly, realized she was gaslighting me, lying to my face. She still tried to lie to me, it was crazy. But no, I know you've seen the trend I did not believe her. Pushed and ended up admitting to me it has been going on for months. Maybe 6 months, maybe less. Who cares.

She went from an emotional affair to a full blown affair with another person. Yea different guy. Married guy. She just couldn't wait until we were apart. Tried to tell me she cared for me and didn't want to hurt me lol. Yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah. Thought she could live two separate lives ""for the kids."" Living in a unhealthy marriage of lies hurting me the entire time. Breadcrumbing, me gaslighting me... Kids are young but they saw my pain (even with trying so so so hard to hide it)

 More concerned about me telling the other spouse than my actual feelings. Admitted to being selfish but meh I don't care, she obviously was. Thought she was ""sparing me the hurt."" Thanks lol. 

Told her she needs to move out. She wants out and I was too dense to see it before. Holding onto a dream that was never going to happen. I can't pretend like something is going to happen. Part of the logistics was finances (we both work). So her moving out is going to be a financial issue. But with everything we'll figure it out. She actually is the breadwinner so good for me? Lol

Don't know what's going to happen with this vacation, that's 2 weeks away. Haven't made that decision, don't know if I will. 

Going to tell the spouse of the other person because I originally wanted to blow up the world, but now it's imo the moral thing to do. Maybe this person is living in a lie like I am and will stop any future hurt. 

No problem telling ppl or friends and family why were separating. I felt like there was hope before, a chance like I've said. Now I feel embarrassed but I didn't do this. Actions have consequences. If friends or family want to forgive her, I'm fine with that. My emotional level of connection was obviously different than there's. But she's not a good person. 

I feel good actually, well I'm telling myself I feel good. Out of this fantasy I was trying to live. I'm still going to be connected to her, we have kids, but I hate her. I'll be there for my kids as they are my life.

1ioka76,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ioka76/where_is_everyone/,Where is Everyone?,"I woke up one day and everyone, absolutely everyone, was - or is, gone. The internet is up, cable is running, electricity and water is still working, yet there's no one around and I can't get into contact with anyone. No one answers when I call on the phone, and although I can see the messages I've uploaded to social media, I see nothing from anyone else, just old posts and comments from the day before this happened that don't change when I refresh.  It's like time has been frozen, and all the animals, humans, and even bugs have been taken out of Earth. 

My name is - Oh, who the hell cares? Who is gonna see this anyway? This is the only way to keep from going insane, uploading detailed accounts of whatever's happening to me even though I have no idea if anyone can see it. If they can see it, then the  responses are invisible to me, because I've tried sending SOS messages to family, friends, and even strangers. 

Nothing big or unexpected happened before that day a few months ago. I'm a regular girl, working part time in the city and sitting through college lectures when I'm not manning the counter of my local coffee shop. I live - or, lived - with my parents and sister who's still in high school, since I couldn't afford to make it on my own yet. I had just come back from a late night shift, working overtime from open to close since someone called out at the last minute, and I took an Uber back home. I used my spare key to get in the house, ate leftovers from dinner, took a hot shower, and climbed into bed. 

I had no dreams or weird visions or anything. I woke up to the sunlight coming through my window blinds. I looked at the time on my phone and realized I had overslept. When I went downstairs, I heard nothing but the TV playing an early morning show my mom loved to watch after dropping my sister off at school. Dad's absence could be explained by him going to work, but my mom's was weird. I looked around for her but when I didn't find her, I didn't freak out. Not until I went outside, but I didn't do that until an hour had passed of me eating breakfast and thinking about the classes I‚Äôd missed the day before and that morning. 

I went out to catch a bus since it seemed Uber couldn't find a ride, and that's when I saw that my parents‚Äô cars were still in the driveway. Maybe my sister went to school on the bus for once, that was plausible, but what wasn't was my dad going to work without his car and my mom running an errand without hers. I remember looking into the windows of their vehicles, seeing nothing amiss, and trying their cell phones. It rang and rang and ended with their voicemails. 

I don't think I realized how completely dead the neighborhood was until I walked to the nearest bus stop. Children's bikes were abandoned on the sidewalk, cars that would usually be gone during that time of day because the neighbors worked morning shifts like my dad were present in the garages. There was no sign of life anywhere, no birdsong, no butterflies or bees despite the weather conditions being perfect for them. Everything was so quiet, like an empty graveyard. I felt like something was deeply, deeply wrong, but I tried not to think about it as I waited for the bus.

The bus did not come after an hour, and traffic was strangely at a standstill. I began walking, travelling further into the city, and that's when I started to grow more concerned by the second. The city was just as dead as the neighborhood. The bus I had been waiting on was parked at a stop on a busy street, with no driver and no passengers. The wind blew grocery bags like they were tumbleweeds across the road, and the buildings, while all lit up from the inside, contained no people. No employees, no customers, you get the gist. At that point, I would've been overjoyed just to see a squirrel climb up a tree. 

I reacted just as anyone would. I panicked, and I mean panicked hard. I had an utter meltdown in the middle of broad street, hyperventilating and curling into a ball, soaked in my own sweat. There was no one around to help me, to call an ambulance or even ask if I was alright. It was maddening, and it wasn't even midday yet. I walked all the way to my job, found the cafe open but vacant, and then walked to my college campus, which of course yielded the same results. I sat down in the lecture hall, frantically googling anything on my phone that may relate to what was happening. All I could think was that the entire city had evacuated, and I was somehow left behind, or something like that‚Ä¶ 

No news had been posted since yesterday on every website I checked. When I tried to refresh browser pages, the tabs would turn blank, and then an error message would appear. I went back home, which took at least three hours of walking, with sores developing on my feet, and got into my dad's car after finding his keys on the key tray in the hallway- a detail I hadn't noticed before. I was crying as I drove around the city, going around cars that were randomly stopped on the street. I drove past the city border, into the next town, which was exactly the same, so I drove to the next town after that one. During my impromptu road trip, I passed by unoccupied airports, the planes all there since clearly there were no flights taking off. 
 
The numbers I kept calling and texting were my family and friends‚Äô and the police. I didn't know what else to do. Eventually I pulled over to the side of the road and sobbed and screamed in frustration, rocking in the driver's seat with my knees pulled up to my chest. I cried until I had no more tears left to shed, and my face was redder than a tomato with snot pouring out my nose like a faucet. This had to be a bad dream, I'd thought. Or some kind of super elaborate hoax of which I was the sole victim. 

Day in and day out, I focused on adapting until I came across someone, and keeping myself sane by watching old YouTube videos and saved Instagram reels. I didn't dare go back home, the lack of the sound of my sister's rude jokes at my expense, my dad's laughter at some stupid sitcom, and my mother's cooking only served to give me a deep depression during which I never left my room so I couldn't be reminded of how alone I was. Instead, I decided to try and make the most of this fucked up situation by travelling, since the world was still functioning, just without the people who made it that way. 

That's something I thought about a lot. As the weeks passed, I was so scared that the lights would shut off permanently and the water would stop running, so scared in fact, that it made me want to vomit and pass out. But that never happened, even reruns of TV shows still broadcasted when I turned on any TV. It was‚Ä¶really fucking weird. I mean, really really weird. Who was keeping the electrical paid, who was tending to the plumbing, who was broadcasting television and keeping WiFi servers up? The only catch was that I couldn't see anything new that was uploaded past the day I realized I was alone, meaning no recent news, no live shows, nothing. 

I tried not to think about this too hard, because to be honest, even though I was glad I could still flush toilets after I used them and turn on lights in dark rooms, the thought unsettled me. It made me feel like I was the center of the universe's cruelest practical joke, but I knew a prank of this magnitude was simply impossible. 

Unless‚Ä¶ unless my brain was undergoing some high-tech simulator while my body was in the real world, making me think this was reality when it's actually a program designed as some mentally scarring experiment to see how a human would react when placed in this situation. At least, if that was the case, there was hope of me waking up and returning to normal society, but again, nothing happened the day before all this, I didn't consent to any experiment or scientific testing. And why would these hypothetical government agents or scientists choose me of all people? 

After the first two months, I began to‚Ä¶enjoy myself, a bit. Not too much, but a reasonable amount I‚Äôd like to think. I know it probably sounds crazy from your end, but if I kept making theories and freaking out about seemingly being the only person on the planet, or at least on the continent, then I would go insane. The hecticness of daily life is something we can all relate to, feeling like a cog in the machine and wondering if life is just one trial of survival after another. You might have thought to yourself, am I just gonna work nonstop until I die? Who am I? Why am I doing this? When can I just enjoy life and take it easy without worrying about the future, or bills? 

Well, when I realized that the upside to humanity being erased (hopefully temporarily) was no rules and responsibilities, I looked at things with a fresher perspective. I would keep travelling until I found someone like me of course (which was making me lose more hope each day, as I'd gone through a few states by this time), but I would at least take a moment to enjoy the peaceful solitude on the way. I've taken the best naps of my life in fields full of wildflowers, went skinny dipping in hot springs, and even went into a restaurant, thawed out the food from the walk-in fridge, and used their kitchen to cook myself gourmet meals to the best of my abilities. 

So many cars had keys in them, like they were all just sitting there for me to take a joyride in. I did donuts in parking lots, I went into Walmarts and stole video game consoles on which I played offline games on, and I slept in mansions and the best suites of any five star hotel. Every door was unlocked, making it unbelievably easy to go anywhere and do anything. One rich person's apartment I crashed in was in a high rise, and I had an amazing time swimming in a pool on their balcony, which you could see the city miles down below through the glass floor. 

I always had to have noise playing wherever I went. I kept one earphone in (in case I heard someone) and listened to music, and I always kept a TV on wherever I stayed. It replaced live human voices for me, it became white noise. I turned my tragedy into serenity, and though I still craved company, at least I could have a decent time until I found help, or woke up, or a scientist pulled the chords connecting my brain to the simulator or something.

That feeling of freedom and carelessness didn't last long, though.  

The third month came, and I was driving through the midwestern region of the country in an RV I'd stolen so I could experience van life like those influencers but without the risk and the money. I was going to the east coast because I wanted to stay in a beach house. My cousin liked renting them in Virginia, Florida, and the two Carolinas, and I‚Äôd always wanted to experience them. Of course, Autumn had come and winter was starting (or should've been at least), but it was still warm enough for a dip in the sea. Global warming, I guess. 

Anyways, night came and I stopped in some random city, choosing an upscale hotel to stay in. Highest floor, biggest room, and a hoard of food from the kitchen, all to myself. I slept like a baby, listening to a podcast, with the flat screen TV playing some reality show. The lights always stayed on, and in this case, it was two bright table lamps, one on each side of the king sized bed, and a standing lamp in the corner. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to complete darkness and utter silence. The TV was off, so were all the lights. The curtain was drawn over the glass wall which showed a beautiful view of the city, when I was sure I had left them open to look at the dazzling lights of the skyscrapers. 

Instantly, I sat up and started breathing heavily, knowing in my heart that my good time was over because the electricity was now gone. I figured I may as well just go back to sleep until daybreak, and then go and steal flashlights from the nearest store for the next night or something, but I wanted to open the curtains first. I guess I must've forgotten that I closed them‚Ä¶ I pulled them aside, and my heart skipped a beat as I noticed something. 

The buildings in the city were still lit up. The energy still worked. I scrambled in the dark, pressing the power button on the bedside lamp. Nothing happened, so I felt for the chord, which had been unplugged. I plugged it back in and the lamp turned on, glowing a soft yellow. Upon a quick investigation, I realized all the lamps had been unplugged, and the remote to the TV was perched on the dresser across from my bed, even though I fell asleep with it on my nightstand. 

Then it hit me, all at once. It felt like the breath had been knocked from my lungs, and I immediately started to tremble. 

Someone had been in this room, while I was asleep. 

And while that should've made me excited to discover another human, it terrified me instead. Because whoever it was decided to fuck with me and leave me in complete darkness, rather than rejoice in the fact they had found another survivor. And if they would truly choose to scare me like this even though I could very well be the only other human left on earth, what type of person were they? Had they gone insane? Were they dangerous? Or was this simply proof that all of this was a hoax and they were now messing with me because I had started to make the best of my situation and that was too boring for the cameras? 

I honestly hoped to God the last part was the answer, because while that would be the meanest hoax ever conceived, at least the nightmare would be over. But not so deep down, I knew the prank theory was utterly stupid, and wrong. I mean, even if it was possible, no prank would go on this long. I just wanted to believe that over my terrifying reality. 

After I turned the lights and TV back on, I noticed the door was open, showing the dark hallway. Now, I'm not the strongest or the bravest, but I knew I had to do something, I couldn't just go back to sleep. I gathered some stuff and used the light of my phone to navigate my way through the now dark hotel building, turning on the lights as I went. 

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

When I got to the kitchen, I took a big carving knife with me, just in case. The dead silence unnerved me to absolutely no end. I searched every room, using keys from the office behind the lobby. It took a while, looking inside closets and bathrooms, but eventually I was able to confidently say that whoever unplugged the lamps in my suite was no longer in the building. I didn't know how to feel about any of it. Half of me wanted to be happy to the point of tears that someone was in this with me, but the other half just knew this wasn't good news at all.

I trusted my gut and decided to leave. 

I got in the RV and drove until daybreak, putting as much distance between me and that place as possible. I became exhausted and parked in the most crowded parking lot I could find, so I'd be hard to spot, then fell asleep. When I woke up in the middle of the afternoon, I started a regular day, trying to put the previous night past me. I toured this city I‚Äôd never been to before and browsed a selection of name brand clothes like Gucci and Prada that I would normally never be able to wear as a broke college student. I looked like a celebrity or some fashion model as I explored, looking for any sign of life. One of the things I missed the most was animals, like seeing someone walk their dog or watching a cat nap in a windowsill. 

When I returned to the RV at sundown, I was met with a disturbing sight. The door to the RV was wide open, and almost everything was out of place. The covers on the bed were strewn on the floor, alongside my clothes and the food and items I'd stolen from stores either for survival or pleasure. The cupboards were open, the faucets were left running, including the tub. And worst of all, someone doodled a smiley face in the dust of one of the RV windows. Two long vertical lines for the eyes and a curve under them for the mouth. This simple picture put so much fear in me I felt like the world was collapsing. 

Once again, someone had intruded in on my space, and deliberately left a sign that they had been there. More than one person had to be fucking with me, because how did the person from the hotel know where I was? How would they have found me so quickly? There are a million places I could be at, there was just absolutely no way they knew I'd be in this one city in this one parking lot. If there was more than one person, then why were they doing this? What did they want? Why don't they just come up to me and talk like a normal human being, so we can figure this shit out together? 

I think that's when paranoia first hit me. Sometimes I don't think I'm paranoid, and sometimes I do. I don't fucking know, okay?! I feel like I'm going crazy. 

Well, that's when I first started having irrational thoughts like, *Who says it's a human to begin with?* And *If it is a human, who says they want to figure anything out? Maybe they know more than you do about why the world is like this, and they know it's unfixable, so they're deciding to have their sick fun with you because, let's face it, who's around to stop them?*

The human brain can be so intelligent, but also so masochistic. Mine was torturing me with all these thoughts until I felt like I couldn't breathe. I decided to pack a bag of the stuff I've hoarded since day one and abandon the RV. I can't count how many times I looked over my shoulder as I left to find another car, I felt watched. 

Once again, I found a vehicle parked with the doors unlocked, small and black which is definitely more inconspicuous than a hulking RV. The keys were, as usual, inside, and once I got to driving away from that city, it felt like I had a breath of fresh air. However, I wasn't going to keep that car for long, because if whoever did that was around to see me get into it, I didn't want them to be able to recognize the car in whatever place I went next. This time, I stayed on the road all day, only stopping to relieve myself at a convenience store and get gas. I tried to appreciate the sights I drove past, but I couldn't stop thinking about the Stranger, which is what I had decided to call him or her. 

It wasn't long then until I would reach the east coast, but night came and I had to sleep. I didn't want to give up comfort just yet, but I was also extremely nervous that I had been followed, although I saw no other cars driving on the road. Instead of sleeping in upscale hotels, I decided to change things up a bit, so I wouldn't be as predictable to the Stranger. I considered sleeping in a crappy, rundown motel, but I wanted to be absolutely sure they wouldn't know my next move. 

I parked miles away from my destination, and using Google Maps which thankfully was still functioning normally, I walked there using back alleys. The sliver of rationality remaining in my brain told me that there's no way they were in that small town without me seeing them following me in a vehicle, but I was taking no chances. I found a big grocery store, took the keys out of a random car in the parking lot that I was gonna use the next morning, and decided to gather some covers from the domestic section and crash in one of the back offices of some manager. I locked the door,  made a pad on the floor, and turned out the light. I ate a dinner of chips and candy, rather than microwaving or cooking something that would release a smell which would indicate my location. 

It was hard getting to sleep, but I managed, trying to quietly listen to ambience soundtracks on YouTube with a Bluetooth earphone stuffed in my ear. Sleep snuck on me really, I didn't even feel myself drifting off, I was bone tired, but confident that I left no tracks and was going to be safe. 

I woke up to music, but nothing was playing on my phone. 

In fact, my phone had died, and the screen was black. 

No, the music was coming from the overhead speakers. An old tune from the 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs, one I faintly recognized but wasn't exactly too familiar with. 

‚ÄòWe'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when-‚Äô

Someone was playing this over the intercom, and it blared throughout the entire store at an almost deafening volume. I sat there on the floor swaddled in covers, shaking so hard I could barely grip my phone as I wondered if it was even safe to leave that cramped little office. That's when I figured I should've tried to find a security room to crash in, as I'd seen cameras installed on the way in earlier. Maybe I could've spotted whoever this was on the footage, but now it was too late. 

I made double sure the door was locked and then plugged my phone up to the outlet in the corner so I could at least see the time. I tried to remain as quiet as possible, in case the Stranger was still there. When I powered my phone on, I realized it was 4AM, and I decided I would not try to leave until sunrise, which should've been in a couple of hours. I just had to sit and wait until then. 

After the song ended, I heard something else play over the intercom. Someone was simply breathing into the microphone. Soft and subtle, but definitely there. The Stranger was still there, and I had no idea how they could've possibly found me. I even checked my phone to make sure my location wasn't turned on anywhere, and went through all my stuff thoroughly to be sure there wasn't some kind of airtag or tracker attached to my clothes or something. My search came up empty. 

I stayed in that back office for most of the day rather than leaving at sunrise, like a sitting duck. I was too scared to leave. Hours passed of hearing nothing, no music and no breathing, but still, I didn't dare move an inch from where I sat on the floor. I was hungry and thirsty. I felt like a child hiding under the covers from a monster in their closet, I felt foolish. Finally, I checked my phone and saw that it was evening time. I had to make a move. 

I looked for anything I could use as a weapon first, and all I found was a pen with a particularly sharp tip. I supposed I could stab someone in the neck with it. My backpack on my back, I crept out the door, and realized that once again, the lights had been turned out on me. Why? Was whoever was stalking me trying to make it easier to get the jump on me? 

I removed my shoes so that my footsteps were quiet, my socks padding on the linoleum floor. The only illumination I had was the street lamps outside streaming white, almost ghostly looking light through the big front windows of the store, and the fridges of course. When I got closer to the front of the store, where the registers were, I heard something fall off a shelf a few aisles away. Not very far at all from my position. 

I immediately crouched down and listened intently, holding my backpack so the items contained within wouldn't make a rustling noise from me jostling it around. I heard no other sounds, but I was sure the Stranger was still here. There was no way whatever that was had fallen on its own. 

Tears of fear slipped down my cheeks as I decided to abandon my backpack, deciding the contents of it were not worth the risk of it making a noise or slowing me down if I had a confrontation. I left it there on the floor as I changed directions, moving towards the back of the store to see if there was an emergency exit or back door I could exit from instead. I should've done that to begin with, but I don't tend to think too rationally when I'm scared at times. 

Indeed, all the way at the back, there were a set of double doors I could just barely make out. They were the kind that had this big silver bar in the middle you had to push to open them, and those always made a noise. I braced myself, and in one swift motion, opened the doors and slipped outside. 

Oh my god, it was absolutely freezing cold outside.

I did feel the back office get colder throughout the day, but I thought it was because of the AC or something. No, it's because it was snowing. Blankets of snow powdered the air, and the ground was quickly being painted all-white. The air felt like I had stepped into a freezer. It had just felt like summer yesterday, and at this time of day the sun was supposed to start setting, but twilight had already fully descended upon the world. The sky was black, not a star could be seen, and the moon was a tiny sliver barely visible. It was barely autumn, let alone early winter! 

While it certainly gave me a shock, I did not waste a moment thinking about the drastic change in weather. Instead, I made my way around the front and ran to the car I'd prepared to leave in. As soon as I opened the door, all the lights in the store came on, and it glowed yellow like a beacon in the dark. I froze and stared at the windows, my eyes scanning for any movement. I thought, for just a moment, that I saw a dark figure slip out of sight behind a shelf, but it was so subtle that it could've been a trick of my imagination. 

I got inside the car, shut and locked the door, ignited the engine, and drove out of that parking lot like a bat out of hell.

Once again, I cried. All I could think was, why? Why me? Why am I forced to endure this psychological torture? The only other person left here is stalking me, and I think they mean harm to me. Where is everyone? Where did you all go? Why did you leave me here by myself, with some fucking lunatic? 

WHY WON'T ANY OF YOU ANSWER MY MESSAGES?! 

Oh but don't think that's the worst part. The worst part is, it only took fifteen minutes for me to run out of gas, even though when I checked the car out the day before the tank said it was full. When I pulled over at a 7/11 to get gas, I noticed the tank was already open, as if someone had messed with it, and a tube that may have once been connected to something was sticking out still, dripping with a dark liquid. I hadn't noticed before, so desperate to get away, but 

Someone had siphoned the fucking gas! 

AND THERE'S ANOTHER FUCKING SMILEY FACE IN THE BACK WINDOW! 

It was drawn with a black marker. 

I checked the trunk and back seat, worried someone had hitched a ride without me knowing. Someone knew I was planning on using this car, and they could've definitely hid in here without me noticing it until it was too late. But they didn't. However, they did leave something in one of the back seats. 

My backpack that I had left in the store. 

How did they sneak out of there so quickly to put it in the car, then go back inside to turn on all the lights? It made no sense! No sense whatsoever! 

There has to be more than one, there has to be more than one‚Ä¶

I checked it. None of my things were inside. In fact, there were just 

Pictures. OF ME! 

Dozens of polaroids, showing me at various times over the past several weeks. Stealing from stores. Eating food. Scouting out cars. And even sleeping. 

In fact, there was a photo of me sleeping in the back office of that store. How THE FUCK did they get in? And without me waking up! The door was still locked when I got up!! That's impossible!!!

This was too much. I felt the entire world spin around me, but I still got behind the wheel and decided to drive as fast and far as I could. I was dizzy but I was also so, so afraid. I almost crashed a couple different times but I didn't care. I was in pure survival mode. 

That was a couple days ago. I'm writing this on my phone. I've been sleeping in my car with a knife ever since, and I plan on locating a gun store when I get to the coast so I can arm myself better, although I've no idea how to use a gun. I park my car deep in the woods at night, away from any buildings. Landmarks just make me easier to find. 

It's not long now until I get to the coast of North Carolina. I plan on getting on a boat and getting out of here. I'm not gonna do anything crazy, like sail to another continent, but I'm gonna skirt the coasts  till I get more down south. I don't feel safe traveling on land anymore. 

I'm going to keep updating as I go. This is the only thing that keeps me sane. I have hope that someone will reach out, or something will happen. I just think 


TGEY FOUND ME!!!;: 

I WAS TYPING AND I HEARD SOMEONE. I THINK ITS A MAN, HE WAS OUTSIDE MY CAR. I DROVE INTK A TREE A ND RAN ON FOOT

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

i(30f) currently stay home with my 8 month old while my bf(39m) of 2~ years works full time. i moved into his house with very little money to my name when the baby was born and he has been taking care of everything since then. home expenses, groceries, baby stuff, my phone bill/car insurance/a few of my more urgent debts. the issue i have is that he only really gives me spending money if i ask for it and maybe $30-$50 at a time, maybe once every 2 weeks or so. perhaps that‚Äôs a reasonable amount but it often doesn‚Äôt feel that way when in the span of a few days i put $20 of gas in my SUV and grab a few things from the store for dinner or maybe a coffee while i‚Äôm out. another part of this is that i don‚Äôt have a complete financial picture of what exactly his paychecks/expenses are and what he does with his money. according to him he‚Äôs always been very private with his personal finances and that we are doing just fine money-wise but he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable allowing me to see the exact numbers. we don‚Äôt have a joint account so i‚Äôm left having to ask for money fairly frequently which makes me feel very uncomfortable and makes me feel like i‚Äôm constantly at his mercy. he‚Äôs not always extremely enthusiastic to send me money and to be fair i‚Äôve not always been the best with money and we are three people living on one persons salary so maybe things ARE tight, but i‚Äôm not able to judge that for myself or have a say in our finances at all with our current setup. for me the most difficult aspects of this are not having any sense of financial agency and the not knowing. we both went into this with nothing but good intentions and did not really think much beyond my partner saying ‚Äúi‚Äôll take care of all the money stuff‚Äù, which to me at the time sounded perfect. i‚Äôve seen other people in this sub who don‚Äôt have joint accounts be told their partner is being financially abusive, and while i don‚Äôt think we are at that point, i could definitely see things ending up that way unintentionally if we don‚Äôt work something out so that i feel more comfortable financially. i think part of it is that he was single for a very long time before we got together and didn‚Äôt have to consider finances beyond himself and it‚Äôs really just not comfortable for him to have to be open about it. of course i think in order to have an equal partnership he will have to open up about it but i can‚Äôt imagine that simply telling him again that i would like to get a better picture of our finances will make him more comfortable with the idea of sharing. i spoke to a friend about this and she suggested we look into finding a third party to talk through this with us so that there‚Äôs a neutral party. only people that are in the area are his parents who would‚Ä¶obviously have a bias toward preserving their son‚Äôs financial security.

I brought my hand grider and 250g bag of beans and it was a big hit. Soon I was brewing around a liter of coffee to share and we went through the bag pretty quickly.

After that, we decided to buy a kg of pre-ground coffee to not deal with the hand grinder. The roastery we buy from gives options of different grind levels. We chose the option ""paper filter"".

Now, the coffee we make comes out as bitter. My guess is the grind is too fine and coffee drains too slow. The dose doesnt seem to change the taste, just weaker or stronger but always bitter.

1iok6ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1iok6ao/seven_things_that_helped_us_in_our_first_6_months/,Seven Things That Helped Us in Our First 6 Months of Parenthood,"As our daughter is about to hit six months, I‚Äôve been reflecting on what helped us, what I wish I could go back and tell my anxious pregnant self, and what might help someone else scrolling here, pregnant and overwhelmed.


**Disclaimer:**
No, I don‚Äôt think parenting is all rainbows and sunshine. No, I don‚Äôt think me having one baby six months old makes me a parenting expert. No, my life isn‚Äôt perfect. No, my marriage isn‚Äôt perfect. Yes, I realize my daughter is only six months old, and things can change. This isn‚Äôt universal parenting advice‚Äîjust what worked for us. But if you‚Äôre Type B, ADHD, and allergic to rigid schedules? This might help you.


**1) Let go of the neurotic, psychotic schedule sh*t.**

Do you really think your libaby needs to eat, nap, and play at the exact same nanosecond every single day? Or did some mommy influencer selling a sleep training course tell you that?

Strictly following our daughter‚Äôs cues has made parenting so much more laid-back. She sleeps when she‚Äôs tired and eats when she‚Äôs hungry. Some nights, bedtime is 8 PM in her crib. Other nights, it‚Äôs in the carrier on one of us during a spontaneous 10 PM dinner.

I can‚Äôt imagine saying no to plans or missing out on life because some random Instagram mom convinced me my baby must nap at the same time, in the same place, every day.

Of course, some babies thrive on a strict schedule. If that‚Äôs yours, great! Roll with it. But don‚Äôt feel like you must just because someone online made you feel like a bad parent for not following a flowchart.

I made a post about this months ago. Many people agreed, but a good amount of people tore me to shreds. Let‚Äôs see how it goes this time. üòèüòÇ


**2) Invest in a High-Quality Carrier vs. an Expensive Stroller**

Obviously, this depends on where you live and your lifestyle.

Now, if you got suckered into the strict schedule mentality by an influencer, I get it. I too have been influenced‚Äîby the Uppababy Vista V2. Was it worth the $1,000? ‚Ä¶Not really.

Sure, it‚Äôs aesthetically pleasing. Specifically we wanted itt because it converts into a double stroller, which we wanted for future kids. However, it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to fold, it doesn‚Äôt handle bumpy terrain well (Denver sidewalks? Local trail walks? Forget it.), and its just generally more trouble than it‚Äôs worth

What do we actually use 99% of the time? Our Wildbird baby carriers. Both of us have one. She loves being close to us and it‚Äôs perfect for those days she just won‚Äôt let us place her down. The biggest win? My husband (who has severe chronic pain from multiple shoulder surgeries + trigeminal neuralgia) finds it comfortable. That alone makes it a huge win.

I am torn on selling the Vista, though, because sometimes a stroller is practical (shopping, downtown, carrying stuff). But if I could do it again? I‚Äôd get a much cheaper convertible double stroller. So if anyone has recommendations for a good, non-$1000 double stroller, I‚Äôm all ears.

**3) Buy a mini fridge for your bedroom. Trust me.**

Especially if you live in a multi-story home. We grabbed a $40 mini cosmetics fridge from Amazon, and it was one of the best purchases ever.

In the early days, it held formula bottles so we weren‚Äôt running up and down the stairs at 3 AM with a screaming baby. If you pump, you can store breastmilk in it until morning. Now that she sleeps through the night (mostly), we use it to keep a few water bottles cold.

**4) Nurture your relationship in a way that works for you.**

All I heard while pregnant was to expect my marriage to go down the toilet.

- ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll probably hate your husband postpartum.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúSex? Count your blessings if it happens once a month.‚Äù

While I won‚Äôt deny the early postpartum days were rough, I can honestly say my love for him has grown to a level I never expected. The attraction? Somehow even stronger. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ a primal, instinctual level of attraction that I almost feel I cannot handle at times. Both of our love languages are physical touch‚Äîthat kind of physical touch. So we made it a priority to keep intimacy alive, even without outside help.

Here‚Äôs what worked:
- Bought a Cheap trifold floor mattress for the basement + LED string lights + cozy blankets = instant escape. A total sexy vibe.

- Bubble baths with music & the galaxy projector. ‚ú®

- Cooking dinner together after baby is asleep‚Äîour go-to is grass-fed steaks, veggies, and wine.

None of this is revolutionary. It‚Äôs just small, intentional choices to keep the connection alive.


**5) Take care of yourself and don‚Äôt feel guilty about it.**

Eat. Drink water. Rest when you can. ‚ö†Ô∏è TW: weight loss discussion

I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI forgot to eat a lot in the newborn days. Sleep deprivation, stress, and ADHD? Appetite: nonexistent. But what I didn‚Äôt forget was my coffee and ADHD meds.

So imagine my shock when I stepped on the scale at 6 weeks postpartum and was 20 lbs lighter than pre-pregnancy. I wasn‚Äôt mad about it. I had wanted to lose some weight pre pregnancy anyway. But I also knew I had to start fueling my body properly if I wanted to keep my energy up. Luckily, I found a balance that worked for me. But don‚Äôt let your well-being become an afterthought.

**6) You Can‚Äôt Spoil a Baby With Love‚ÄîHold Them If You Want To.**

How many of your out-of-touch boomer relatives told you that contact napping, co-sleeping (room sharing, not bed sharing), or responding to cries would ‚Äúcreate bad habits‚Äù?

Mine did. Repeatedly. One in particular LOVED telling us that letting our 4-day-old baby sleep on our chests was a ‚Äúbad habit.‚Äù Yes, how awful of us to let the only two people she knows in the entire world help her feel safe enough to sleep. üôÑ

Fast forward to New Year‚Äôs, and I suddenly realized‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time she slept on my chest. I asked my husband if he remembered. He paused for a moment and said ‚ÄúProbably Thanksgiving?‚Äù At the end of January, she fell asleep on his chest for the first time in months. He badly had to pee, he was definitely uncomfortable, but he didn‚Äôt dare move because it might be the last time.

Moral of the story? Screw the outdated ‚Äúbad habit‚Äù talk. Hold your baby. Because one day, they just‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt anymore.

**7) Misery loves company‚Äîdon‚Äôt let it drag you down.**

Very quickly, you will notice how some people LOVE to try and ruin the moment. You know, the classic ‚Äújust waits!!‚Äù. Ha, I bet I‚Äôll even see some in the comments:

- ""Just wait until you have a toddler! You‚Äôll hate your husband then!""

- ""Just wait until you have your second kid, you‚Äôll see how much time/want for sex you have then!""

- ""Just wait until she‚Äôs 4 months / 6 months / 1 year / 2 years‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll HAVE to sleep train and put her on a strict schedule!""

You know what? Just wait‚Ä¶ until I prove you all wrong. üòâ

Parenting is wild, exhausting, and unpredictable. But if you tune out the fear-mongering, let go of the guilt, and do what works for YOUR family, it becomes so much more enjoyable. You‚Äôve got this. üíú",81,1739456747.0,newborns,21,0.98,False

* Two workouts per day. Each workout must be at least 45 minutes, and one of them must be performed outdoors.

* Follow a strict diet. ...

I meal prep on the weekends and calorie count the whole day.

* Drink one gallon (3.8 liters) of water per day. ...

1. Even if I skip a workout, I still have to bike to work and back from work, which counts towards the daily 45 min workout outside.

1iok1o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1iok1o5/decreasing_negative_xp_bug_weird_stuff_in_paradiso/,Decreasing / negative XP bug + weird stuff in Paradiso,"Hello everyone. Around level 77, I've encountered a very unpleasant bug, and I need some help to get to the bottom of it. Maybe it will help other people, too.

Short version: I need to know which variables, hidden game settings, scripts etc. answer for XP multipliers / buffs OR a function that makes your XP negative when you serve time in jail.

  
Long version:

Unfortunately, I can't pinpoint the exact moment when the bug happened. Moreover, I'm not sure there *was* an exact moment; I think it happened kinda gradually. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with Starvival mod, because other people who had similar bug usually had Starvival installed. But since deactivting and removing the mod did nothing, it doesn't matter already (also, I really can't play Starfield without Starvival anymore lol).

So, here's the sequence of events.

1. I have a mod called Apotheosis. It ""integrates"" starborn powers into gameplay in a more natural way, and it has its own system of perks that you can buy for quantum essence. First glimpse: one day, I noticed that I have like 4956432134 units of QA, and the button ""use quantum essence"" doesn't work anymore. Since I'm not into starpowers that much, I decided to ignore it.

2. After some time I visited Paradiso and finished its main quest. Then I started taking minor quests there, and something weird happened: for the quest to activate, I had to go to other location (i.e. through loading screen). For example, the guy at coffee bar gave me the quest, but it activated only when I traveled to the top floor on the elevator. I had this bug with all minor Paradiso quests. Everything is okay in other places, but then I started exploring the planets, and I would get the XP reward and survey data for 100% survey only when I return to my ship (i.e. after loading screen).

3. When I finished one of the minor quests at Paradiso, I had extremely weird number on that pop-up panel on the left - as if I got something like 478543964386 XP. The actual reward in credits and XP was normal, it was just a number that was weird. But I think that was the moment when I started going downhill.

4. After some time I noticed that some of my actions (crafting, for example) give no XP whatsoever. Then, I started getting *negative XP rewards* for quests and exploration. I mean, if I get 500 XP for a finished quest, I actually get -500 XP. Every time it happens, I hear that booming sound that you hear when you're going to jail for a crime. For some reason, I can still get actual XP for combat, but there is no logic in that. I fought some creatures at a random abandoned base at one of the planets in Groombridge system, and I was getting XP for that. At the same time, when I fight against aggressive fauna on the other planet in the same system, I get negative XP.

I tried to narrow down the list of reasons for that bug. I have no bounties, no visible debuffs / status effects. I was arrested only once (on the first time, I agreed to help Ikande with Crimson Fleet, on the second time, I had some contraband on my ship and paid the fine). I tried to get arrested and to serve time again to ""reset"" my criminal status, but to no avail.

I checked all the GameSetting variables related to XP through console, and they all look normal. Same with ActorValues. Then I wanted to look through character variables using the command player.ShowVars, but the list is too big, and I don't know how to export it into .txt file (**any help on that matter will be very useful**!).

I tried using different XP-related console commands, and the only one that did something was **setgs fXPExpMult**. Unfortunately, so far I don't understand how to pick up the correct number for this setting: when I change it, the multiplier changes dramatically. I either get +1200 levels for +10 XP, or -100500 millions of XP instead of +1 XP. And it doesn't fix the bug, because I still hear that booming sound.

So, to summarize, I think that something turned on the trigger that equals XP-rewarding function (*CGF ""Game.RewardPlayerXP""*) to going to jail. Therefore,I need to know which variables, hidden game settings, scripts etc. answer for XP multipliers / buffs OR a function that makes your XP negative when you serve time in jail.

I feel like I‚Äôm going to be single forever. I suppose that isn‚Äôt the worst thing, but romantic physical touch is something I have been missing lately. I‚Äôm SURE I could find someone to have a one night stand with if I wanted, but I can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs just not me. I only crave intimacy when I have an emotional connection. I wish I wasn‚Äôt like that. 

Why does my heart feel so heavy?
