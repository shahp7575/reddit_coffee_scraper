1luvzbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1luvzbf/low_heart_rate_and_extreme_nausea_with_leaning/,Low heart rate and extreme nausea with leaning forward,"55 year old female, 5'5"" 154 lbs, non- smoker, only daily medications are Symbicort inhaler and 1000 mg Vitamin D3 (and a couple of cups of morning coffee). My issue is that if I do any leaning forward for more than a few minutes, say leaning forward cleaning out a box or even sitting at my computer desk and leaning forward on my elbow, I get incredibly nauseous and lightheaded. My heart rate dips down to the low to mid-50's (measured via Fitbit watch and also with a pulse oximeter) and it takes a good hour or two to recover. The muscles in my upper back and neck area feel sore, I have a mild headache and prior to the episode I felt like I had butterflies in my stomach, which I wrote off to my morning coffee. This has happened to me before, but it's been close to a year. I did have a similar feeling episode during a stress test. They did it my first visit to the cardiologist and it occurred as the test was winding down. Everything looked normal to them and my nausea and dizziness was attributed at the time to having caffeine prior to the test.
In addition, I wore a monitor for 24 hours, had a nuclear stress test (because of how I felt after the initial stress test), a carotid Doppler and a calcium score. I was told I have a very mild mitral valve prolapse, my carotids are crystal clear, my EF and stress test is normal. Halter monitor showed heart rate while sleeping briefly dips into the upper 40's, but nothing out of the ordinary. I get my calcium score results next month, but it's not expected to be bad. 
In hindsight, I guess I should've tried to trigger an episode like this to happen during the 24 hours I was wearing the monitor? 
My question is, now what? I can try to never have to lean forward at my computer desk or to clean anything ever again, which seems extreme. The intense nausea and feeling faint really bother me, especially because it takes what feels like forever to subside. I sit back on the couch with a heating pad on my neck and upper back to help the muscles relax.
Any recommendations for what to do next or is this just a very annoying part of aging?  Could this be a neck problem, inner ear, or something else entirely?

Hey there,

I‚Äôm a 32-year-old introvert with a not-so-secret wild streak, splitting my time between the cozy corners of Jalandhar and the electric buzz of Delhi on weekends. I might seem reserved at first, but beneath the surface, I‚Äôm all about cheeky banter, spontaneous adventures, and making memories that leave us both smiling long after the night ends.

I believe in the magic of a lingering glance, the thrill of inside jokes, and the art of making a woman feel truly desired. Whether it‚Äôs a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you‚Äôre the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who‚Äôs as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn‚Äôt afraid to let her playful side show.

When I‚Äôm not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you‚Äôll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you‚Äôre craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let‚Äôs see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

1luvvf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebritycruises/comments/1luvvf2/first_celebrity_cruise_review/,First Celebrity Cruise Review!,"For my first Celebrity cruise, I traveled on the Equinox Barcelona-Cadiz-Lisbon-Porto-Tangier-Barcelona itinerary from June 18-28.

Staff: Okay, the staff made my experience. I have cruised with other lines and the staff are fine, especially on Disney, but the staff on this ship were amazing. Our cabin steward went above and beyond. We also requested the same wait staff at dinner each night because they were so excellent. The baristas at the coffee counter in the Oceanview Cafe were also really cool and fun to chat with each morning. We left everyone additional tips because they made our journey great.

Room: We had a concierge class stateroom with a balcony on deck 11. There were three of us, and I slept on the sofa bed, which was actually extremely comfortable. The room didn't feel to small for the three of us, and there was plenty of room under the beds to put our suitcases, shelf space, etc.

Food: I thought the food was excellent. The Oceanview Cafe had plenty of selection including lots of Indian cuisine and plenty of vegetarian/vegan options. The Silhouette restaurant was also great and had plenty of selection every night. We did eat at a specialty restaurant, the Tuscan Grill, one night, and although it was good, it was only marginally better than the regular restaurant.

Drinks: We are not big drinkers, but the basic drink package was included in our price. We did get specialty coffees every day, which were fine, and a glass or two of prosecco and wine each night. The martini bar was really good, and I didn't mind paying a bit more for their specialty martinis. I would recommend the basic drink package if you don't need premium liquor as it does save money.

Entertainment: I am not super into seeing shows on cruises, but my party was, so I went to almost all of them. The performers were very talented, but the shows were kind of weird. We didn't stay up late for all of the other entertainment, but there was always lots going on. I also love that they have a card room for people to play games. My mother-in-law played bingo on a sea day and really enjoyed it.

Pools/Gym/Spa: I love that they have an adults-only pool area. It was super quiet, and I was able to relax and read while swimming. The main pool deck is really nice, especially if you want sun. This cruise definitely isn't geared toward kids, so if I had a family, I might choose something like Disney instead. But since I don't, it was great for me. The gym was spacious and had plenty of room for guests even at peak work-out times. I also loved the walking track on deck 14 and used that quite frequently early in the morning. We didn't get any spa services but did get blowouts at the salon one day. It was pricey, which is to be expected on a cruise, but they did a great job, and it was a nice treat.

Excursions: I booked all of my excursions through Celebrity. I thought they were a pretty good value and most delivered. One excursion didn't go as planned because the main attraction was closed due to a holiday, and our tour guide tried to make the best of it, but some rude boomers on the excursion kept yelling at her and I had to tell them to STFU. Celebrity did give us a small refund, which was fine as the excursion was cheap and I still had a great time despite the change of plans. On the excursion in Tangiers and Tetouan, they kept taking us to these random places where they pressured us to buy stuff. I've had these experience on trips to China and India as well, and it is always awkward, annoying, and takes away from sightseeing time. Other than that, I really enjoyed the excursions. I also paid $155 to do the ship excursion on the sea day. It was way too much money, but I have always wanted to do one, so I don't regret it. It was really interesting and gave me some more insight into the workings of the ship, the working conditions, etc. 

Overall: I really enjoyed my experience with Celebrity and feel like the value was good for what I paid for myself ($3,000 for a concierge class stateroom with balcony shared with two other people, basic drink package, included tips). I loved that it was mostly adults and didn't seem crowded. I think the service really puts it over the top as a company. Viking River will always be my #1, mainly because of the smaller environment, but I think Celebrity will be my ocean cruise go-to from now on!",2,1751998356.0,celebritycruises,0,1.0,False

First, I love my in-laws. Love them. I've been married for nearly two decades to an Iowan. We regularly visit the state for holidays and simply family visits. But they're not exactly tech savvy. 

I do the bulk of the driving. And close-in to their home, they certainly know the area better than I ever will and better than the GPS.  And I'd never challenge their directions in their area. 

THE ISSUE: But once we go beyond their hometown (and in rural Iowa, it's quite normal to drive 30-50 miles to grab coffee, shop, dine, etc.) they have their known routes on getting places... That definitely aren't the fastest or best. Lots of gravel road driving, for example. 

On the GPS, I can clearly see what they want me to do vs what the device is suggesting -- and how much faster it would be to take the suggested route. When I have tried to point out that the GPS is offering a faster option, they instantly dismiss it out of hand. I also have pointed out that GPS can tell them of road closures or slow downs and that's also dismissed as not needed (and when we have encountered a closed road, I've never said anything and their only acknowledgement is to laugh and say that maybe GPS knew and continue on).

Recently, I was driving, had the GPS on and could see that the difference between their preferred route and the suggested route was 12 minutes. I took the faster route, politely feigning that I didn't hear them in time. I could tell this irked them. But I was just done with sticking to what they knew only.

What irks me is that they DO use the GPS when they visit us (another state and much larger metro area). So they see the value of it, just not in their hometown state.",2,1751998017.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

But a few weeks ago, I sat on my porch during a quiet sunrise, sipping coffee, listening to the birds, and I felt something I hadn‚Äôt in years: peace.

There was no dramatic event leading up to it. No life-changing moment. Just a feeling that I was right where I needed to be.

Since then, I‚Äôve started appreciating the little things, morning light through the window, the way my dog greets me like I‚Äôm the best person on Earth, random laughter with a friend. For the first time, I‚Äôm not waiting for ‚Äúmore‚Äù to be happy. I just *am*.

1luvn12,https://www.reddit.com/r/saltspringisland/comments/1luvn12/day_trip_itinerary/,Day Trip itinerary!,"Hi everyone, sorry if something like this has already been posted here.

My boyfriends birthday is coming up in August and I am planning on surprising him with a day trip to Salt Spring for the two of us! We will be taking the Seaplane with Harbour Air, which lands in Ganges at 9:20AM and check in for departure is at 4:20PM. This leaves us with around 7 hours to explore!

I've been trying to plan a rough itinerary for us, as I can be a bit of a Type A scheduling freak lol, but I also know my boyfriend is a bit more ""go-with-the-flow"" so I don't want to hard set plan the whole day. So that said, I'm super open to any sort of suggestions anyone here has! Here is the schedule I have so far:

**9:20:** Arrive + get unloaded off the plane  
**9:40(ish):** Coffee + light breakfast, my boyfriend loves to have a good cup of coffee in the mornings and just sit and relax with it! Would love some suggestions on where to go!  
**10:15/10:30(ish):** Wander the Farmers Market (we will be going on a Saturday) and town area  
**11:45 - 2:15:** Goat Island Kayak Tour (hoping to get in touch with them to book this as it is unavailable online, but if not we will just rent stand up paddleboards or kayaks for a couple hours and just explore on our own!)  
**2:30-3:30:** Late lunch, looking for suggestions! We both love trying different types of food, so we are open to anything that's good :)  
**3:30-4:20:** ?

As you can probably tell, I don't have much planned and so far the only thing booked is our flights, so anything can be altered! If you have any suggestions, must sees/must try's, please do let me know! As well, if you don't think the Goat Island kayak tour is worth the money and time, pleaseee do tell if there is something else we should do! 

Thanks so much for the help and ideas in advance :D",1,1751997813.0,saltspringisland,0,1.0,False

# Discovering Budapest's iconic landmarks

To truly kick off your Budapest adventure, immersing yourself in the city's most famous sights is a fantastic starting point. From awe-inspiring architectural wonders to deeply poignant memorials, these landmarks aren't just pretty pictures; they offer a genuine peek into the very heart and soul of Hungary.

# Visiting Budapest's neo-Gothic parliament building

Perched majestically along the graceful curve of the Danube, the neo-Gothic Parliament building is nothing short of a postcard superstar. It's not just a feat of architectural brilliance; it also cradles the revered Holy Crown, which has graced the heads of Hungarian monarchs since the 12th century, alongside other glittering royal jewels. Trust us, embarking on a guided tour, especially one in English, is an absolute must to truly grasp its immense grandeur and historical resonance. Pro tip: secure your tickets online well in advance, because this gem is incredibly popular!

Just a stone's throw from the Parliament, you'll discover the profoundly moving ""[**Shoes on the Danube**](https://thebudapestguide.com/2024/04/24/the-shoes-on-the-danube-bank-a-poignant-reminder-of-jewish-tragedy/)"" memorial. This poignant tribute silently honors the Holocaust victims who, on a chilling winter's day, were tragically forced to remove their shoes before being shot into the icy embrace of the river. It‚Äôs a moment for quiet reflection.

# Soaking at one of the city's incredible thermal spas

Prepare for pure bliss! Budapest is literally bubbling with natural springs, which explains its delightful abundance of thermal spas, many of which whisper tales from the Turkish rule era. These mineral-rich waters are legendary for their purported healing magic, making a dip in a thermal pool an utterly essential Budapest experience. It's like a warm hug for your soul!

The world-famous [**Sz√©chenyi Baths**](https://www.szechenyibath.hu/) is Europe's largest spa complex. While it attracts a lively crowd of tourists, its magnificent architecture and sprawling outdoor pools still guarantee a truly splendid time. For a different vibe, explore other spas sprinkled throughout Budapest's neighborhoods, like the [**Rudas Baths**](https://budapestprogram.eu/rudas-thermal-bath-a-historic-oasis-of-relaxation-in-budapest/) with its cool rooftop hot tub (imagine soaking under the stars!). If tranquility is what you seek, the [**Gell√©rt Baths**](https://www.gellertbath.hu/), with its mesmerizing stained-glass windows and vibrant porcelain tiles, offers an incredibly serene escape.

# Taking a ride through downtown on tram 2

Ready for a scenic joyride? **Tram 2's route** is often celebrated as one of the [most picturesque tram journeys on the planet](https://capitalshooting.eu/public-transport-in-budapest-how-to-visit-capital-shooting-range/)! It elegantly glides along the Danube's edge, effortlessly linking Margaret Bridge (J√°szai Mari t√©r) to south Pest. This little beauty cruises past a parade of downtown attractions, offering panoramic views that will make your camera happy ‚Äì all for the price of a standard public transportation ticket! What a steal!

If you're feeling adventurous, a charming boat trip on the Danube can also be a delightful alternative. In fact, you can even hop on public boats with a regular transportation ticket if you fancy a river view without the dedicated sightseeing cruise price tag.

# Having a coffee at a historical coffeehouse

Step back in time and indulge in Budapest's centuries-old coffee culture. The city's classic coffeehouses are more than just places to grab a brew; they're magnificent spectacles, living museums where Hungary's literary giants once pondered and penned their masterpieces. The [**New York Caf√©**](https://newyorkcafe.hu/en/), once proudly proclaimed as the most beautiful coffeehouse in the world, is the epitome of this grandeur. Prepare to be dazzled by its gilded and marble surfaces, rich crimson accents, sparkling crystal, intricate frescoes, and dazzling chandeliers ‚Äì often accompanied by live Hungarian music. It's like stepping into a glamorous, bygone era. But don't stop there! Other equally enchanting choices for a historical caffeine fix include Gerbeaud, Hadik, and Centr√°l.

# Exploring Budapest's diverse districts

Beyond the well-trodden tourist paths, Budapest's various districts each proudly sport their own unique personality and offer a delightful array of distinct experiences. Get ready to peel back the layers of this fascinating city!

# Strolling along Andr√°ssy √∫t and in City Park

Imagine Budapest's very own Champs-√âlys√©es, and you‚Äôve got **Andr√°ssy √∫t**! This magnificent, tree-lined avenue is a parade of elegant shops, charming cafes, and stunning architecture. It stretches grandly from behind the basilica all the way to Heroes' Square, one of the city's most iconic monuments. As you leisurely stroll along this impressive route, you'll encounter the majestic Hungarian State Opera House and the deeply poignant [**House of Terror**](https://www.terrorhaza.hu/en) museum, which once served as the chilling headquarters where victims of brutal regimes faced unimaginable torture. It's a powerful reminder of history.

Where this grand avenue gracefully ends, City Park unfurls. This expansive green haven on the Pest side boasts a serene lake, perfect for gentle rowboat adventures in the warmer months, transforming into a magical ice rink when winter whispers through the air. The enchanting, fairy-tale-like **Vajdahunyad Castle** and the famous Sz√©chenyi Baths also call this park home. If the thought of walking the entire length feels a bit daunting, fear not! The Millennium Underground, continental Europe's oldest metro, runs conveniently along the entire stretch of Andr√°ssy √∫t.

# Exploring the Castle District

Perched regally atop the rolling hills of the Buda side, the former **Royal Palace** stands as one of Budapest‚Äôs most emblematic and enduring structures. Though it has courageously weathered destruction and reconstruction countless times throughout history, it now proudly houses the Hungarian National Gallery and plays host to captivating temporary exhibitions. It‚Äôs a journey through art and resilience!

Within the charming confines of the Castle District, you'll also discover the whimsical **Fishermen‚Äôs Bastion**, which offers truly unparalleled panoramic views of Pest‚Äôs glittering skyline across the majestic Danube. Just a few steps away, nestled among the charming, winding cobblestone streets, lies the stunning Gothic **Matthias Church**. For a delightful interlude of coffee and cake, you absolutely must visit Ruszwurm, Hungary's longest-running confectionery ‚Äì a sweet taste of history!

And for a gripping dive into the past, the **Hospital in the Rock Nuclear Bunker Museum**, complete with lifelike wax figures and original medical equipment, was once a fully functioning hospital hidden beneath the Royal Palace. Getting up to the palace is an adventure in itself: try the vintage funicular, one of the oldest in the world, which whisks you up in mere minutes, or opt for bus 16 (with stops throughout the city) for a scenic and easy ride, or simply enjoy a rewarding hike!

# Seeing the religious relics of the basilica

Just a few blocks from bustling De√°k Square, you'll find the exquisitely ornate **Basilica of St. Stephen**, the largest church in the entire city. But it's not just its sheer size that impresses; inside, it carefully guards the country‚Äôs most revered, and undeniably intriguing, religious relic: the embalmed right hand of St. Stephen himself, Hungary's revered founding king. It‚Äôs a sight that sparks both awe and curiosity! For some of the most spectacular, jaw-dropping views of Budapest, you can either bravely ascend the 193 steps to the basilica‚Äôs dome or simply take the elevator for an equally rewarding experience.

# Enjoying Budapest from different perspectives

To truly grasp the sheer beauty of Budapest, you simply must experience it from a variety of captivating angles. Prepare to be enchanted!

# Seeing the city from a viewpoint or rooftop bar

With its graceful curving Danube, elegant bridges, and stunning landmarks, Budapest is a city designed for dramatic vistas. It's exceptionally beautiful and incredibly photogenic from above! So, make your way up to the **Citadella** and Budapest‚Äôs majestic Liberty Monument on Gell√©rt Hill for a truly rewarding panorama that will steal your breath. If you'd rather soak in the views with a delightful beverage in hand, exploring Budapest's many chic **rooftop bars** is an absolute must. Just a friendly heads-up: some parts of the Citadella might be closed for ongoing renovations, so it‚Äôs always good to check ahead.

# Spending a day on Margaret Island

**Margaret Island**, Budapest‚Äôs expansive green heart, is an absolute urban oasis, blissfully accessible on foot from the charming yellow Margaret Bridge. The entire island is one glorious, sprawling park, home to the atmospheric ruins of a medieval church, a serene Japanese garden (perfect for a quiet moment), a lively outdoor theater, towering century-old trees that whisper tales of time, and countless idyllic spots just begging for a picnic. A highlight not to be missed is the island's recently renovated musical fountain, which bursts into a synchronized light and music show every hour from 11 AM, captivating audiences from early May right through to the end of October. It's pure magic!

# Appreciating the distinctive architecture of the Great Synagogue

Prepare to be mesmerized by the Moorish-style **Great Synagogue**, a true architectural marvel and, impressively, the largest Jewish place of worship outside of New York City. Built in 1859, this strikingly distinctive structure, with its eye-catching crenellated red-and-yellow glazed-brick facade and two magnificent towers, stands proudly adjacent to the Hungarian Jewish Museum and Archives. As you wander through the courtyard, you‚Äôll discover the deeply moving Holocaust Tree of Life Memorial, a poignant tribute designed by sculptor Imre Varga. It's a powerful experience.

# Budapest's vibrant culture and hidden gems

Beyond the well-known tourist trails, Budapest truly shines with its unique cultural experiences and fascinating historical insights. Get ready to uncover some hidden gems!

# Experiencing the best nightlife at ruin pubs and garden clubs

Oh, if you're visiting Budapest in the summer, an evening spent at one of the city's many \*kertek\* (meaning ""gardens"") is simply non-negotiable! In this creative city, it seems almost any outdoor space can be magically transformed into an electrifying entertainment zone. These often informal venues, including quirky courtyards, pulsating rooftops, and the legendary \*romkocsm√°k\* (**ruin pubs**) that spring to life in abandoned buildings, might be seasonal or even change year to year. But fear not, some of the most wildly successful ones are thankfully permanent fixtures, buzzing with energy all year round. Prepare for an unforgettable night out!

# Exploring history in Memento Park

For a truly unique historical detour, journey to **Memento Park** in southern Buda. Think of it as a fascinating open-air museum, a ""cemetery of socialist mistakes,"" where statues and memorials from the communist era have found their final resting place. This collection of four dozen statues, busts, and plaques depicting figures like Lenin, Marx, and various local strongmen (such as B√©la Kun), were originally erected as late as the 1980s and remained in their original spots until the early 1990s. If you find yourself with a third or fourth day in Budapest, making the trip to Memento Park to witness these banished communist statues offers a wonderfully distinct and thought-provoking experience.

# Riding the rails in the Buda Hills

While the **Buda Hills** might not be overflowing with major historical sights (with the notable exception of B√©la Bart√≥k‚Äôs house, where he spent his final year in Hungary), they offer a truly welcome escape from the city's hustle and bustle during the warmer months. But perhaps the greatest charm of these hills lies in their wonderfully unusual transportation options! Imagine: a narrow-gauge cog railway, dating all the way back to the late 19th century, carries you charmingly up the hills; then, a train actually operated by children (yes, children!) transports you across; and finally, a graceful chairlift glides you serenely back down to solid ground. It's an adventure in itself!

# Visiting Capital Shooting

For an experience that's truly off the beaten path and offers a unique thrill, consider a visit to **Capital Shooting**. This [indoor shooting range](https://capitalshooting.eu/shooting-range-near-me-not-so-fast/) provides a safe and controlled environment where you can [try your hand at various firearms](https://capitalshooting.eu/how-to-choose-an-indoor-shooting-range-your-ultimate-guide/) under expert supervision. It's an unusual but memorable activity that offers a different kind of adrenaline rush compared to the city's historical and cultural attractions. Whether you're a seasoned enthusiast or a curious beginner, the professional instructors ensure a [safe and engaging experience](https://capitalshooting.eu/proper-stances-for-shooting-with-pistol-and-rifle/). It‚Äôs certainly a conversation starter for your trip!

# Planning your time in Budapest

Budapest truly deserves at least two full days, even if you‚Äôre a whirlwind traveler intent on hitting the highlights. However, to truly sink into the city's rhythm and uncover its deeper charms, consider dedicating a luxurious third or even a fantastic fourth day. More time also means more opportunities for enriching day trips outside the city.

Each evening in Budapest unfurls a delightful menu of options: savoring scrumptious meals at cozy restaurants, perhaps catching a mesmerizing opera or a captivating concert, embarking on a romantic river cruise that glides past illuminated landmarks, unwinding in a soothing thermal bath (some stay open late, perfect for a night soak!), diving into the lively world of the city's ruin pubs and other nightlife hotspots, or simply enjoying a tranquil stroll along the floodlit Danube embankments and across its shimmering bridges. The choices are endless!

# Budapest in two days

Got just two days? No problem, but you'll need to be a strategic explorer, picking out one or two major must-sees. Your most rewarding choices include the grand Parliament (seriously, book those tickets online!), the striking Great Synagogue, the opulent Opera House, and the poignant House of Terror.

# Day 1

Dedicate your entire day to the vibrant Pest side. Kick off with a delightful self-guided Leopold Town Walk, then transition into a Downtown Pest Walk, culminating at the bustling Great Market Hall. Afterwards, meander around the Small Boulevard towards De√°k T√©r, perhaps pausing en route at the majestic Great Synagogue. You might then feel energized for an Andr√°ssy √∫t walk, weaving into a Heroes' Square and City Park walk. Alternatively, if your feet are already sending signals for a break, simply hop on the M1/yellow Metr√≥ line straight to H≈ës√∂k Tere to admire the Heroes' Square statues and the fairy-tale Vajdahunyad Castle. As the late afternoon sun dips, reward yourself with a supremely relaxing soak at the world-famous Sz√©chenyi Baths. Ah, bliss!

# Day 2

In the morning, tie up any loose ends from your Pest itinerary that you didn't conquer yesterday. After a delicious lunch, catch bus #16 or #216 from De√°k T√©r, heading up to Buda's historic Castle Hill to embark on a captivating self-guided Castle Hill Walk. Finally, return to Pest for a well-deserved dinner and reflect on your incredible journey.

# Budapest in three or more days

With three or more days, you have the glorious luxury of diving much, much deeper into Budapest's captivating soul. Prepare for a truly immersive experience!

# Day 1

Start by getting wonderfully acquainted with the Pest side. Begin with a self-guided Leopold Town Walk, which includes a tour of the magnificent Parliament (and yes, a friendly reminder to book those tickets online well in advance!). Follow this with a leisurely Andr√°ssy √∫t Walk, weaving in tours of both the stunning Opera House and the sobering House of Terror. Next, take the Metr√≥ out to explore the impressive Heroes' Square and the sprawling City Park. Cap off your day with a truly rejuvenating soak at the legendary Sz√©chenyi Baths. Pure relaxation!

# Day 2

Continue your delightful exploration of Pest. Start with a Downtown Pest Walk. After visiting the vibrant Great Market Hall, gracefully circle around the Small Boulevard for a comprehensive Great Synagogue and Jewish Quarter Tour. If you're eager to experience another one of Budapest's famous spas, simply cross the majestic Danube to Buda for a blissful soak at either the Gell√©rt or Rudas baths. Decisions, decisions!

# Day 3

Utilize your morning to visit any remaining Pest sights you haven't yet had the chance to explore. Then, after lunch, hop on bus #16 or #216 from De√°k T√©r and ascend to the historic Castle Hill for a truly comprehensive Castle Hill Walk. You‚Äôll uncover layers of history and stunning views!

# With more time

If you're blessed with a fantastic fourth day, you can leisurely spread out the self-guided walks from Day 1, revisit any cherished sights you might have missed, or even embark on a unique trip to **Memento Park** to see that fascinating collection of old communist statues. For five or more days, the possibilities truly expand, allowing you to incorporate exciting side trips outside the city. There are numerous easy and incredibly rewarding day trips available, along with a few charming towns that are absolutely worth an overnight stay or two, such as Eger, P√©cs, Sopron, and even nearby Bratislava. Your adventure awaits!

# How to make the most of your Budapest visit

To ensure your trip to Budapest is as smooth as Hungarian goulash and as joyful as a Sziget Festival concert, keep these practical tips in your back pocket for navigating the city's fantastic attractions and experiences.

1. **Book popular tours in advance**: Seriously, for showstoppers like the Parliament building, securing your tickets online beforehand is like finding gold ‚Äì it saves you precious time and guarantees you won't miss out!
2. **Utilize public transport like a local**: Budapest boasts an absolutely brilliant public transportation system ‚Äì think trams, metros, and buses that are truly a traveler's best friend. Did you know a standard public transportation ticket can even get you on incredibly scenic routes like Tram 2 or charming public boats along the Danube? Consider a multi-day pass for ultimate convenience and freedom to roam.
3. **Embrace the thermal baths with gusto**: Don't just peek in; dive in! Pack your snazziest swimsuit, a fluffy towel, and some trusty flip-flops. While some spas offer towel rentals, bringing your own is often the savvy traveler's choice.
4. **Explore on foot ‚Äì your happy feet will thank you**: Many of Budapest's most charming streets and captivating districts are simply begging to be discovered by walking. So, slip on your most comfortable shoes, because you're about to rack up some serious steps!
5. **Savor the coffeehouse experience ‚Äì slowly**: Dedicate a glorious chunk of time to truly soak in the grand ambiance of a historic coffeehouse. This isn't a grab-and-go situation; it's about sitting back, savoring a delectable pastry, and letting the centuries of history wash over you.
6. **Consider a Budapest card ‚Äì your wallet might too**: If your itinerary is packed with museum visits and heavy public transport use, a Budapest Card could be your secret weapon, offering fantastic value with free or discounted entry to a plethora of attractions and unlimited public transport.
7. **Learn a few Hungarian phrases ‚Äì it‚Äôs charming**: While English is widely understood in tourist hotspots, sprinkling in a few basic Hungarian phrases like ""hello"" (szia), ""thank you"" (k√∂sz√∂n√∂m), and ""please"" (k√©rem) is not only polite but also a delightful way to connect with the friendly locals.
8. **Carry Hungarian Forint (HUF) ‚Äì for little treats**: While credit cards are widely accepted, it's always a smart move to have some Hungarian Forint on hand for those charming smaller purchases, vibrant market stalls, or places that simply prefer good old cash.
9. **Check opening hours ‚Äì nobody likes a closed door**: Always, always double-check the opening hours of attractions, especially around holidays. You don't want to show up to a locked door!
10. **Be aware of renovations ‚Äì stay informed**: For grand attractions like the Citadella, it's a good idea to quickly check for any ongoing renovations that might temporarily limit access to certain areas. A quick online search before you go can save you a detour!

1luvedy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1luvedy,9 day fast - my experience,"I debated making this post because I'm not anywhere near my goal weight buuuuut maybe it'll help someone else. Until now I've only done 72-96 hour weekly fasts but my kiddo is out of town so I decided to take advantage of the situation and push myself a bit longer. TLDR at the bottom. Also sorry for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile because I can't remember my password üôÉ

Pre-fast prep: strict carnivore for 2 days. A big fat steak, some hamburgers, and shrimps to my hearts desire. I normally still try to stick around 1200-1500 calories but since I knew I was going longer I didn't worry about them. 

Fasting start date and weight: 28Jun/208lbs (94.3kg)
Days 1-3 were pretty normal. The protein overload sustained me through the 1st day but towards the end of the second I started to get some rumbling. Drank some electrolytes, told myself you got plenty of food stored. Like a little 5'2 hairless bear for the winter. They pass quickly. Day three was uneventful. 

Day 4 was mentally challenging. I work from home and have multiple meetings a day. During one of them we were casually chatting and a coworker brings up her 45lb (20.4kg) weightloss. Another coworker asks about what she's doing and she brings up the Hers site and they answer the questions together. Y'all, when I see that I could take a pill and lose weight with ease for $50 a month I almost quit. I'm out here raw dogging it with an empty stomach and soft salty water when I could just take a pill??? It messed me up for a couple days. I'm pretty sure I told my dog that comparison is the thief of joy so many times she now thinks it's a command for kisses. 

Days 5-7 I discovered how much fasting will make you sweat during physical labor, that I'll dream about about breaking my fast, and I turned down free sushi :( the food noise is starting to die down though, no longer is WENDYS TAKI CHICKEN SANDWICH on repeat in my brain. 

Day 8 went to my GP. Despite my friends concerns everything came back great. Blood pressure perfect, heart rate actually lower than normal but in a healthier range, doc notes I'm down 25lbs (11.3kg) from my last visit. He has no qualms with my fasting as long as I'm being safe. Also, I'm tired of soft water and a mouth full of pennies.

Day 9 wasn't supposed to be my last day, but with my son coming home in a couple days I wanted to be a good digestive place so we could have a meal together when he gets home. Broke my fast with Millies Tomato Basil sipping broth with an egg stirred in. 

During all of this I did struggle with a bit of energy loss and executive disfunction due to food noise (WENDYS TAKI CHICKEN SANDWICH) and having time off from work. My to-do list was not sufficient enough. I use Fast Lyte fasting electrolytes +mineral complex as my electrolyte source and would get about 4700mg potassium, 2300mg sodium, 400mg magnesium, 100mg calcium with 677mg of various other minerals daily. Also pinches of Japanese Nuchimasu salt throughout the day, not just for the sodium but it's actually delicious lol. 

Bests and worsts: the best part of it all was I didn't need any coffee, tea, or energy drinks. I've been wanting to cut back on them for awhile now (I drank 2 a day) and at the start I bought 4 to put in the fridge. There's still 2 left. I also feel so much more in control mentally. I know I don't NEED to finish all the food on my plate, which is something I've struggled with from childhood due to being poor. Obviously losing 14lbs (6.3kg) falls under the best too lol. THE WORST part was the food noise in the beginning. It's super nerdy but Oschon from Final Fantasy XIV was on repeat telling me I can overcome this üòÇ also drinking electrolytes is not great either, but it's a necessity. The pennies thing was disgusting. 

My advice for anyone that wants to go past 72 hours, a to-do list is ESSENTIAL. I got a lot of house and yard work done, but things that also keep your hands and mind engaged. Lego, puzzles, painting or paint by numbers, crochet, etc. Have projects and TV shows queued up and ready to go! Scrolling and reddit are not engaging enough. 

TLDR: Fast starting weight 208lb (94.3kg) ending weight 194lb (6.3kg). It was hard but I did it, hairless bears, pennies, and Wendy's Taki Chicken sandwich.

I'm a home coffee roaster using a Yoshan EC500 machine, and I'm having a really hard time finding any technical information or specific recommendations for this roaster. I'd really appreciate your help in trying to develop a roasting profile for washed Yirgacheffe beans, which is what I'm currently experimenting with.
I usually charge the beans into the machine at a temperature of 180-195 degrees Celsius. The roaster has separate dials for air heat intensity and drum rotation speed, both ranging from 1 to 10 (with 5 being the default). It's important to note that I can't change the temperature during the roast; it has to be set beforehand.
I'm frequently experiencing sharp drops in the Rate of Rise (RoR) or ""stalling"" during my roasts, and I'm trying to figure out how to overcome this within the machine's limitations.

1luvah9,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1luvah9/recently_relapsed_after_a_long_long_time/,"Recently relapsed after a long, long time","This is a long story. It started when I was 14. I'm 37 now. But I think getting it out with people who understand and hearing I'm not alone will help me heal. I never spoke about any of this to anyone in detail until this year. I only ever just referred to him as the teacher I had a crush on and never went into any details. 

At 14, I developed what I thought was a crush for my art teacher, who was in his late 30s. Important to note, my parents have a large age gap - 27 years - so the idea of an age gap wasn't weird to me. But this   
""crush"" was all consuming. I had him as a teacher for two years in a row, but we spent a lot of time together because I was the student chair of the art committee and he was the teacher sponsor. He would drive me home after art committee. I ate lunch in his classroom almost every day. I'm AuDHD and had no clue at that time. I didn't have very many friends, and felt constantly like I didn't belong. I also had a lot of interests that were not typical teenager interests - politics, art, history. I liked, and still do, deep conversations. I had a really hard time identifying with my peers, often finding them immature and annoying. I got along much better with the adults around me. He made me feel safe and seen.

Nothing ever happened between us, but the student/teacher line was blurry. He treated me as an equal. He recommended books and music to me, told me of places he'd visited that he thought I'd like, shared life stories with me. He was one of the few close friends I had. He told me once that the silence with me was comfortable, which is something that stuck with me and I still replay that conversation in my head. He also told me once after I got a haircut and dyed my hair black that I looked Korean. I'm not Asian. I'm as white as white can be. His wife is Korean, something I didn't make the connection to until now. I knew I was, without a doubt, his favourite student at the time. In fact, I was so certain, a couple of friends and I showed up at his house unannounced. I found his address in the phone book. I didn't get in trouble. He invited us in. The only people who knew this even happened were the people who were there until now.

On top of being my teacher and more than 20 years my senior, he was also married and a new father. The guilt and shame for wanting him for myself was overwhelming. I never wanted to ruin his life and his family, but I would have, and I hated me for it. I needed it to end, so I wrote him a note confessing everything, and gave it to him on a Friday just as I was leaving school when I was 16. On Monday, we never really talked about it. He told me he obviously wouldn't be able to drive me home any longer. I remember a tone of disappointment in his voice, but I don't know if that was real or not. He did end up making me go to see the guidance counsellor, who asked me if I wanted to unalive myself. Nope, just didn't want to keep feeling like I was being suffocated for feelings I didn't want to have. 

We drifted apart after that and I graduated the next year, but I never forgot him. He's always felt to me like someone I could turn to at any point for help, and he'd do whatever he could, if that makes sense? We kept in loose touch after I graduated through email. I sent him updates and photos when I travelled to Prague and Paris in university. We saw each other a couple of times and I didn't feel those intense feelings. Shortly after that trip to Europe, I met my now SO, and we've been together for 16 years. 

Eventually, he and I found each other on FB and became friends. He barely uses social media, so we rarely interacted. He did send me a message once about 10 years ago after he saw my mom and they chatted. I was in the midst of life with small children, so while I did message him back, I didn't obsess over it. He also works at the same school as my best friend, so while we weren't always in contact, we were kind of floating around in each other's spheres.

Then, stupid Taylor Swift had to release The Tortured Poet's Department last year. The lyrics struck a chord with me in the most intense way and dug up all these memories and feelings I had worked really hard to suppress for 20 years. I've spent an awful lot of time processing all the shit I had buried, examining and really understanding my experiences and how they've shaped the person I am now. While I curse her, it's also been extremely fulfilling and illuminating to know myself more deeply.

Then came 2025, the worst year of my life to date.

Just before Christmas, my dad was admitted to hospital with fluid on his lungs. He stayed in hospital until the end of January. I took a week in January to go sit with my dad in hospital. I went back home and stayed with my mom (my parents split after high school), but I didn't have my kids or SO in tow. It was just me, and I'd drive to the hospital and stay there with dad until dinner time. He slept most of the time, so I really was just in my head alone for the first time in over a decade in a city I hadn't spent a lot of time in since I had graduated high school and moved away for university. The memories flooded back, and I found myself searching faces in cars and on sidewalks looking for him. Taylor Swift is a devil woman.

I sent him a message on FB saying I was in town because dad was in hospital, but this song (I look in people's windows) made me wonder if maybe I'd see him while I was home. I messaged him dad was okay (at that point), and I wasn't sure if he remembered me, but it might be nice to catch up. He messaged back, and with that, the last shreds of my sanity started to slip away. 

We messaged back and forth a bit, catching up on 20 years' worth of life. I told him about my husband and kids; he told me a bit about his kids. At one point, he did leave me on read and I messaged that leaving me on read was its own kind of vibe, and maybe it was presumptuous of me to assume he'd want to talk to me at all. We never really talked about the note, so I have no idea how it impacted him personally or professionally. Maybe it really fucked his life up. But he messaged me back and said something along the lines of no, no, I'm just really awful at messaging and I kept this thing you made for me, and I still say the phrase that was an inside joke to the two of us all the time. I had no memory of the thing he kept, so I asked what it was. He took a photo of it and sent it to me. It was a scrapbook I had made I don't remember when, but when I tell you it was in perfect condition, you'd never know it was more than 20 years old. No fading, no rips, no wrinkles or creases. This man knew where this thing was because he treasured it. He treasured something I gave him. Fuck. 

My dad died the second week of February. He was released from hospital the week he turned 85 at the end of January, then had a stroke at the beginning of February. The fluid on his lungs was from cancer he never told my brother and I about. I drove down to be with dad as he passed, and kind of kept him in the loop with what was going on. At the beginning of March, I was in a car accident and my car was totaled. I was largely fine, outside of some bruising and cuts. The hassle of insurance was exhausting. Two weeks after that, I developed a rash on my breast that was textbook inflammatory breast cancer (it wasn't, but it took two months to figure that out). My dog also developed a lump on her foot that ended up being cancer. It was just one thing after another. I was barely keeping myself together. You know what was there for me though? Ol' dopamine slot machine limerence was. 

Now, I will say my relationship with my SO is excellent. We are, at this point, at the best part of our time together. He loves me deeply and I love him deeply. We have a home, kids, pets, a life together. He was the one who held me while I cried after losing my dad. He was the one who picked up the phone and calmed me down after my accident. My life right now? Best it's ever been. I have more friends than I ever could have imagined as a teenager. Real, deep friends who love every little weird bit of me. The loneliness that I felt as a teen couldn't be further from how I feel now. I also really like myself in a way I didn't when I was younger. But old habits die screaming.

I went home over Easter, and he and I met for coffee. It was really nice and so easy. We had coffee outdoors because I'm immunocompromised and don't eat inside in public places. He came bundled in a coat and hat because he wasn't sure what I meant when I said I don't remove my respirator inside public places. It was sweet. He also gifted me some cyanotypes he made and some little Lego men for my kids. He told me a story about how his kids would wreck any Legos, so he put then up high where they couldn't reach. He asked me about the job I had just started, about my husband and kids, things I had said in my messages that he hadn't responded to directly. He told me about his life, his kids, his wife, his work. We talked about our parents, when his parents died and how. He told me about what he wants to do when he retires in a year. He told me he thinks I'm probably the big thinker in my relationship with my SO, just like his wife is the big thinker in their relationship (a second wife comparison). We hugged more than once. When we parted, he said, ""There, now you know a bit about my life,"" which was a reference to me saying I'd like to learn more about his life and when he left me on read.

Riding the high from that meeting, I thought I could bring up The Note. I had mentioned it in messages, apologizing for some of my unhinged behaviour. I asked him if he knew that I had feelings for him before I gave it to him. Aaaaand he blocked me. This was a week after our coffee meeting. I thought it was a safe question because he clearly knew. He's not dumb and while I thought I was subtle, I was not. But he blocked me, and I was blindsided. I spiraled so hard. Shattered would be an understatement. I couldn't stop crying. 

This was the beginning of May. I've spent the last eight weeks examining every single aspect of our relationship, reading about limerence, talking with my friends and my SO, just trying to make sense of it all. I spent all my time in high school and afterwards convincing myself he only considered me a student, there was no way I was as important to him as he was to me, no way he could feel anything. He's married! And so much older. But I don't think that's the case. He blocked me because he doesn't want to talk to me about it, but why? Nothing happened that would get him fired. My SO asked me if he was ever handsy with me, and I said no, if anything we avoided touching each other. The more I sit with it, the more I think maybe he actually returned at least some of my feelings and he's terrified of admitting it, as any sane adult would be. 

Now, I know exactly what you're thinking. I was a child. He was an adult. That's fair. I asked my bestie, who has worked with him for 14 years, if there were ever any rumours or anything about him having inappropriate relationships with other students. She said no, he's painfully apathetic towards students. 

Prior to being a teacher, he was a photographer (which I learned this year, and I went to art school for photography with no idea he did photography before teaching, the invisible strings be stringing for the limerence). He was late to teaching. I was a student in his second year of teaching. I think he spent a lot of time with adults. He was, to the best of my knowledge, newly and happily married. I don't think he went into teaching anticipating he would connect with a student on that level. But then I showed up and he treated me like an adult without thinking too hard because we just vibed. I think me giving him that note made him go ""Oh shit"" and then he had a very clear distinction in his mind between students and non-students, hence the future apathy. He was my friend, and I was his friend. Friends fall for each other all the time, except it was wildly inappropriate in our case. He never thought he'd have to admit to one of the biggest cardinal sins of teaching and being an adult. He panicked and left me in pieces, when all I wanted was just to know what it was. 

And so, here I am now. Trying to make sense of everything and let it all go. I've been cleaning my house, removing every reminder of him. I mailed the cyanotypes he made for me back to him with a letter explaining why. I threw those Lego men into the river. I recently found a painting I did while in his class. It will be getting burned. I can say definitively that I do not want him anymore. I do not want that life. He's 60 years old. We haven't really known each other in 20 years. The rational side of my brain gets it. She knows where we've gotta go. But that lizard part of my brain, the part of me that's still 16 and in love with the man who made her feel safe and special, isn't there yet. 

Maybe one day I'll get the conversation I've wanted for so long, to know exactly who I am to him and what we were. I'm so certain that if circumstances had been different, if I was older, he was younger, we met at a different place and time, or if we were both currently unattached, we would've had a romantic relationship. But I also kind of hate that, admitting to myself that he probably did return some feelings. The circumstances were wrong and still wrong. We're both happy, just with other people, and I think that has to be where this story ends. Now, I'm focusing on letting myself grieve him, grieve the us that could never be, but also know that the reasons I sought him out don't apply any more. I'm not alone or unloved or out of place. 

I've felt the claws of limerence lifting with each revelation, and I just keep repeating them like a mantra. I don't know that I'll ever be ""over"" him, but I know I'll be okay. ",1,1751997040.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1luv972,https://i.redd.it/axnegvlguobf1.jpeg,Glacier Done Right,"The journey across the rails less traveled by was a wild one, but completely worth it. 

What looked to be a major setback turned out to be a blessing in disguise. With the surprise bus bridge of the coast starlight on July 3, I was ready to toss out the entire rail itinerary but was convinced by my partner in crime to try and get us back on track. 

We started with a flight to Seattle and a quick 40 minute-ish light rail trip from the lame SEA to the cool train oriented SEA. The transfer was easy with a bit of walking. 

A long layover in Seattle of several hours lent us the opportunity to go explore thanks to Amtraks luggage storage option at $10/bag. We rented e bikes, explored the town, checked out the Pike Place market, and had some excellent coffee from a local roaster as well as cheesesteaks. 

On the 28th we boarded the Empire Builder Eastbound. The bedroom was cozy and climate just right. Being on the Seattle stretch scored us the diner car, whereas Portland passengers are stuck with meals of some sort delivered to their room as we have the diner car. 

Dinner was amazing as always and the socializing was just right. Our sleeper car attendant Donald was wonderful. We did have a small hiccup along the way in Everett with police activity causing the train to be on hold. I had the pleasure of hanging out with one of my coworkers who lives out there who snagged a photo of us. 

In the morning we had breakfast and were seated with this couple who talked about their plans to visit Glacier and see family. One of them just so happened to have the same egg allergy my partner does, what are the odds? 

The railroad French toast was excellent. We arrived right on time the next morning. Our host, Fort Williamson, had a shuttle service and picked us up at the West Glacier Amtrak. This station does not have checked bags which is rather shocking given that‚Äôs the hotspot for entering the park. The platform there is still incomplete and a conductor told me the fenced off concrete slab has been in works for ‚Äútoo long‚Äù. One has to exit/enter the train from a yellow stool that is in the ballast which is a challenge for those having mobility issues. 

Our host also does car rentals, so we had that ready and waiting for us at the cabin, a Camero convertible which made Going to the Sun Road a blast. They even gave us a vehicle pass for our first day which are very hard to come by. 

The adventures throughout the week were absolutely amazing, but that‚Äôs a different story as we focus on the Amtrak part. 

The week comes and goes, and it‚Äôs time to get back on board the Westbound Empire Builder the night of the Fourth. 

The departure was on time, but hiccups come forth along the way. Our roomette was rather hot, but our sleeper car attendant was very nice and lent her plug in fan to help mitigate this. This was a first and a very nice gesture. 

The roomette also had cracked stairs which made going to the top bunk rather tricky. 

Sold out, and because we had to make a connection at Portland, this train set only had ONE sleeper car but two coaches. 

Kind of surprising. We had a long stop at whitefish which lent itself to see the fireworks firsthand and capture the above photo. This was great to see, along with watching them in the lounge car and the panoramic windows. 

Overnight, we end up stalled in the middle of Montana. Couldn‚Äôt see what was going on and as we approached the 90 minute mark, I start to worry about if we will miss our connection. It turns out we were waiting for a very long freight to pass the upcoming tunnel. Likely too large to fit in a siding. I start to plan for alternatives in case as being home before Monday morning is a must. 

Morning comes, and we lost the diner car to Seattle‚Äôs stretch. Breakfast is served in the cafe car, continental style. You pick what you want and they create a receipt you sign at no cost if you‚Äôre in sleepers. The cafe car options have improved, I had a bagel breakfast sandwich and my partner had oatmeal and a bagel with some huckleberry jam we bought during our adventures. They also let us take a muffin as well, those are really crumbly and delicious. 

Ultimately, we make it to Portland only 30 minutes late, giving us plenty of time to make the coast starlight. 

The lounge in Portland let us store our bags at no cost. We find a local market, grab lunch, and  head back to board. It turns out that Portland passengers aboard the coast starlight going south can also get lunch assuming an on time arrival, which surprised us. Luckily I brought a second stomach and had their burger. 

Our sleeper car attendant was Justin, who I have had throughout the years and he was one of the first SCAs I had over a decade ago. He‚Äôs the best and I remember him from when he pointed out a farm of trees that were spliced along the route. Jason manages the diner car, and he too was great and has been there for some time. We gossip about all the different changes throughout the years. 

All in all, a great journey. I would do it again, and I‚Äôm so glad that I was encouraged to keep our travel by rail when that pesky bus bridge almost had me give up. Had we taken that bus bridge, those other delays in Seattle would have resulted in 9.5 hours of delays. 

Luckily we had an extra day padded into our schedule and that made everything line up favorably including the avoidance of the Klamath falls to Sacramento overnight bus bridge.

This decision has not come lightly, as unexpected construction challenges have created a dramatic decline for visitors to all businesses along Colfax. Instead of closing the doors and walking away, we choose to pivot!

Our vision is filled with intention and highlights in a more interactive and intimate way, the sense of community and collaboration we designed into Le Clare‚Äôs store front. While our charming walk-in shop will no longer be open for pastries during set hours, this pivot allows us to create more hours of offerings, with even more time to connect and hear the stories and inspirations we want to share, in the same space.

*I am excited to announce something more enriching and more fruitful for sharing and connections*:

¬†**ViDa Eats Culinary Collaborative‚Äî a collaborative culinary kitchen and experience space.**

This new concept will feature:

* **Hands-on cooking classes** for adults and teens, families, coworkers and friends
* **Airbnb culinary experiences** and private dining experiences
* **Seasonal High Tea Parties, High Tea brunches, and themed events**
* **Custom charcuterie and small bites catering**
* **Custom desserts and Dessert Wall catering or event pickup and dessert offerings by request**
* A rotating menu of **collaborations with local makers and chefs** will be available inside for purchase when you access through one of our offerings

We‚Äôre transforming the space into a gathering ground for food lovers, creators, and community. Please suggest our location for anyone looking for the above and looking to collaborate in the culinary sense. Our kitchen remains active ‚Äî just in a more interactive and inspired way.

Our final weekend for the retail shop will be in two weekends, with the last day of serive on ¬†**Saturday July 19**, ¬†calling it ***our Pivot Party*** and coinciding with our **1-Year Anniversary Celebration.** We invite you to join us, on the patio, for dancing, desserts, and damn good vibes! We have DJ Blake Britton spinning tunes, Savageau offering drip coffees, R&R headlabs offering fresh fades and glitter ‚Äòstaches, and glow ups from RA Aesthetics. Finish with a toast towards all the magic to come, with our friends at Bruz! All guests in attendance will receive 25% off their first booked class or experience!

Thank you for being part of our story so far. I hope you‚Äôll join us for this next chapter ‚Äî filled with more learning, more laughter, and obviously more delicious memories. üòä

**My plan currently:** 

Kitchen: Thin console table for dining 

Main room: 

* queen bed
* love seat sofa (sectional or adding an ottoman)
* small round coffee table
* television (can be mounted or on top of a console/dresser)
* small desk and chair
* bookshelf
* togo chair next to the window for reading. 

**Notes-** 

* I was considering putting up IKEA Kallax shelves or something similar next to my bed to separate the space
* that little 5' nook to the right next to the closet could house the tv with a curtain over it, maybe a the desk, whatever. Would be cool to utilize that space.

We just work as FOH so not a career job or anything to affect my life too much. We don't see each other too much but over the weekend we had 2 shifts together. From complementing my name, asking were it's from and offering to make me coffee, to asking if I got home okay, I'm confident that there might be something there. Don't want to rush anything based on previous experiences.

I next see her next Wednesday, don't plan to do it then but I'll just see how things go. Work party is early August might do it after then. But I haven't seen her too much but we have a good connection and she finds everything I say funny for some reason.

My biggest downside is that she smokes and vapes, (I joke about it all the time) but I'm happy, just this time, to ignore it right now, which is rare for me.

1luv63x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1luv63x,House plan,"Long-time lurker, first-time poster‚Äîexcited to finally share something!

We just wrapped up our second meeting with the architect and would love feedback from this incredible group on our first floor layout (2,556 sq ft). This is still early in the process, so any critiques or suggestions are truly welcome.

A couple of clarifications:
 ‚Ä¢ The space labeled as a ‚Äúsecond kitchen‚Äù is actually going to be a large pantry‚Äînot a second kitchen.
 ‚Ä¢ The dining room in the front of the house is really just a flex space. Since our kids are still young, we plan to use it as a playroom for now. Down the road, we envision it as a homework space, teen hangout zone, or even a formal study.
 ‚Ä¢ The room labeled as ‚Äúoffice‚Äù is more of a sitting room‚Äîa comfortable, conversational area near the front entry with a loveseat or small sofa, a couple of armchairs, maybe a coffee table. We‚Äôre not planning to use it as a full working office, more of a cozy spot to read, chat, or host guests.

We‚Äôre hoping to create something functional and timeless, so any tips to improve layout, efficiency, or design are much appreciated. Thanks again to everyone in this group‚Äîthis community has been such a helpful resource!",1,1751996767.0,houseplans,0,1.0,False

Literally and figuratively......","This happened a couple years ago when I bought my first house in a chill little neighborhood. Everything was great except for one thing: my back neighbor, Rick. Rick‚Äôs the kind of guy who owns two grills but no shirt, drinks Coors Light in the driveway at 10am, and thinks property lines are just a ‚Äúsuggestion.‚Äù

Rick also had this massive golden retriever named Duke. Duke was cool, friendly, but had a very specific habit: he loved to drop the nastiest logs right in the middle of my lawn. Not near the sidewalk. Not behind a tree. Dead center, like it was his sacred spot. Every. Damn. Day.

First couple of times, I figured maybe Rick didn‚Äôt realize it. So I walked over, super polite, and asked if he could maybe keep Duke on a leash or at least scoop the poop when it happened.

Rick, wearing a tank top that said ""Weekend Warrior,"" looks me dead in the eye and goes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all nature, bro. You don‚Äôt own the Earth.‚Äù

Oh. We‚Äôre doing that.

So I tried the normal stuff: patched the fence, put in a motion-activated sprinkler, even tried some citrus deterrent. Nothing worked. Rick actually laughed when he saw the sprinkler and said, ‚ÄúNice try, but Duke‚Äôs built different.‚Äù

Cool. I‚Äôm built different too.


Here‚Äôs where the revenge starts.

I started collecting Duke‚Äôs turds in a Home Depot bucket. Lined it with a trash bag, used a scoop, added a little water for‚Ä¶ aesthetic reasons. After about two weeks, I had something that looked like a cursed soup.

One Saturday morning, while Rick was out, I took that bucket and painted the border of his yard. Sprinkled it like fairy dust right along his deck and around his precious fire pit area.

He came out later that day, sniffed the air, and literally went, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is that smell?‚Äù

I was sitting on my porch drinking coffee like, ‚ÄúSmells like nature, bro.‚Äù

But wait, it gets better. We have a neighborhood Facebook group. I started posting ‚ÄúLost Dog Poop‚Äù updates every time Duke hit my yard.

> ‚ÄúFound: steaming hot dog present near my mailbox. If this belongs to you, please collect your property before it fossilizes. Thanks!‚Äù


Then I started putting up tiny little ‚ÄúDo Not Poop Here‚Äù signs made out of popsicle sticks and toothpicks, complete with glitter and googly eyes, all over the lawn. I made them in weird passive-aggressive haiku form:

```
Dear Duke the Pooper  
This is not your golden throne  
My grass feels betrayed
```


Rick was not amused. He actually stormed over one day and yelled, ‚ÄúAre you trying to make me look bad?!‚Äù

I just blinked and said, ‚ÄúBuddy, I don‚Äôt need to try.‚Äù

After all that, the neighborhood fully turned on him. A couple other people came forward and said Duke had been leaving surprises in their yards too. Rick ended up having to build an actual fenced-in dog run and started walking Duke on a leash like a normal human.

And me? I still make those little haiku signs for fun.

TL;DR: Neighbor let his dog use my lawn as a toilet. I turned it into a public shaming campaign with poop-themed art and passive-aggressive poetry. He now walks his dog like a responsible adult. Victory smells like fresh-cut grass and not dog crap.",365,1751996736.0,pettyrevenge,25,0.97,False

Hey you!

Are you a maverick? A wild card? A loose cannon with nothing to lose and a coffee addiction to prove it?

Perfect. Because I‚Äôm definitely getting too old for this shit, and its HIGH TIME someone demanded my badge and gun on their desk by the end of the day.

So‚Ä¶ you in? Wanna make some questionable life decisions together?
Good. Saddle up, Rookie. You‚Äôve just been assigned a new partner.

Hi, I‚Äôm Jarod.

No, I‚Äôm not really a cop. Faaaaar from it.
I‚Äôm actually an artist (graphic designer with a soft spot for watercolors), a nerd (think MTG, D&D, TMNT, and the Discworld flavor of geekery), a bit country (raised on a ranch ‚Äî boots, beards, and a deeply suspicious respect for cows), and just a smidge fancy (I love to cook and I will judge restaurant plating like it‚Äôs the Food Network).
I lean left. Both politically and because I walk with a limp. (It mostly only shows when I‚Äôm tired, but it‚Äôs there. Call it character.)

I‚Äôm almost 3 years into recovery from alcoholism ‚Äî and yeah, it feels weird to celebrate 2 years of not wrecking the ever-loving-hell out of my life, but it was a hard-fought win. So... hey. I did that. And now, I‚Äôm on this whole-ass journey of self-discovery, self-love, and (hopefully) self-assembly into someone even better. Part of that means actually putting myself out there to meet people ‚Äî good people, the right kind of people.

I‚Äôm polyamorous and demiromantic.
I‚Äôve got two amazing partners. I live with one and a meta, and see the other a few nights a week. We practice kitchen table poly ‚Äî think: community, care, and a tangled, respectful web of humans doing their best to love each other well.

Despite all that, I still have plenty of time for conversations, connection, and open evenings to share.

So, what‚Äôs the M4R angle?
I‚Äôm looking for community (if it exists), friends (if we click), and connection (if the stars align).

No pressure. No expectations. Just two humans seeing if the vibes vibe.

If you made it this far, I think we just solved our first case together.

1luv1a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1luv1a4/dark_reflection_chapter_one_blood_and_rain/,Dark Reflection: Chapter one - Blood and Rain,"*Tokyo | 4:12 a.m.*

Tokyo was never truly dark.

Even at this hour‚Äîwhen the last train had stopped running, and the streets should have been quiet‚Äîthe glow of neon still buzzed from rooftop signs and vending machines. A blue haze clung to the windows, shifting with the motion of a flickering television across the alley. It painted everything in a sickly light, like the city was always in a state of sickness. Never dying. Never healing.

Detective Takashi Arai opened his eyes to the sting of dry air and stale sweat.

His apartment was small‚Äîbarely more than a room with a kitchen sink‚Äîbut the shadows inside it stretched longer than the walls could contain. Something was wrong. Even before he moved, he could *feel* it in his limbs. That ache in the joints. That tightness in the chest. A sensation, not pain, but something worse. Like guilt.

The first thing he noticed was the blood.

His shirt‚Äîwhite, formerly‚Äîwas stiff and dark around the sleeves. Flakes of brown-red broke free as he moved, brushing across his futon. His slacks were stained at the knees. His hands‚Ä¶  
He held them up to the pale light.  
Dirt. Blood. A scrape on his right knuckle. His fingers trembled.

Takashi sat up, slowly. The pounding in his skull grew louder with each breath.

He was on his futon, but not under the blanket. His boots were still on. His jacket‚Äîwet, muddy‚Äîwas slung over the space heater, which hadn‚Äôt been turned on. One of his gloves was missing.

A red crayon rolled off the nightstand as he moved to stand. He watched it fall. It clinked against the floorboards and spun in a tight circle before stopping, pointing toward the door.

He stared at it.

It wasn‚Äôt his.

The bathroom mirror had a crack running down the center. Takashi stared at the line like it was a scar‚Äîhis own reflection split, distorted. His dark hair stuck to his forehead. There was blood on his collar. Dried. Dull.

He stripped out of the shirt and turned the faucet. Cold water rushed over the cloth in the sink, turning pink, then red, then brown. The water ran for almost three minutes before it ran clear.

He looked at the mirror again.  
Still broken. Still him. But something in the eyes‚Ä¶  
Off.

His phone buzzed on the edge of the sink.

>

The subway was half-empty. Men in suits slept with their arms crossed. A schoolgirl nodded off on her phone. The rain outside hit the windows in thin diagonal lines, like the city itself was scribbling something furiously‚Äîtrying to get it out before it drowned in silence.

Takashi leaned his head against the glass. The movement of the train blurred the lights outside, making the streets look like streaks of tears. He tried to remember where he'd been last night. There were flashes.

The smell of cigarettes.  
A dark hallway.  
Screaming?  
No. Not quite.  
A girl‚Äôs voice saying, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

He closed his eyes.

# Akasaka | 6:03 a.m.

By the time he reached the crime scene, the building was already wrapped in yellow tape and news drones buzzed in the sky like hornets. A tall man in a black coat was vomiting into the bushes near the entrance.

Detective Yuki Tanaka stood by the door, a cigarette hanging from his lip despite the signs.

‚ÄúYou look like shit,‚Äù Yuki said, stepping aside to let him pass.

Takashi didn‚Äôt respond.

Inside, the hallway was pristine‚Äîmarble floors, clean lighting, the smell of lemon cleaner. But at the penthouse level, the air changed. Metallic. Sour. Familiar.

Two bodies. Husband and wife. Bound and gagged, found dead in the living room. No forced entry. No signs of a struggle. Blunt force trauma and precision wounds.

The daughter‚Äîage 6‚Äîhad been found hiding under the kitchen sink by first responders. Silent. In shock.

Takashi took it all in.

The coffee table was littered with empty glasses, prescription bottles, and one sheet of printer paper. A drawing in thick crayon lines.  
Three stick figures: two tall, one small.  
The two tall ones were crossed out in red.  
The small one had a wide smile.

He stared at it.

Red crayon.

Eli.

His brother had drawn like that. Always red. Even when the picture was meant to be happy.

Takashi reached into his coat pocket to grab his notebook‚Äîand found something else.  
A red crayon.  
He stiffened.

Sora Ishikawa‚Äôs voice cut through the tension.

‚ÄúTakashi?‚Äù

He turned. She looked at him carefully, concern lining her face.

‚ÄúYou all right?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said quickly, tucking the crayon deeper into his coat. ‚ÄúJust tired.‚Äù

Back outside, the rain had stopped. The air smelled like ozone and ash.

Yuki walked beside him, silent for a while. Then:

‚ÄúLooks like another Guardian hit.‚Äù

Takashi didn‚Äôt respond.

Yuki continued. ‚ÄúSerial killer. Three cases in the last two weeks. All child abusers. No charges. No arrests. But now they‚Äôre dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe girl‚Äôs alive,‚Äù Takashi said.

‚ÄúYeah. Just like the others.‚Äù

He lit another cigarette. Offered one. Takashi shook his head.

Yuki squinted through the smoke. ‚ÄúI get why people like this guy. He‚Äôs doing what the system won‚Äôt. But still‚Ä¶ something about this one feels personal.‚Äù

Takashi looked down at his hands.

Still stained. Still shaking.

When he returned to his apartment, the sun had risen. The light through the blinds made harsh angles on the floor. His jacket dripped onto the doormat.

He stepped into the bathroom and faced the cracked mirror again.

Stared.

Waited.

His reflection blinked.

Then smirked.

Testing the Krispy Kreme 5000204024 Single-Serve K-Cup Pods was akin to bringing the familiar aroma of a Krispy Kreme coffee shop straight into my kitchen. Having been a coffee enthusiast for as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve tried countless coffee blends, pods, and brewing machines. This medium roast coffee promised a mix of bright fruit notes with a smooth, clean finish‚Äîand oh boy, it delivered! The simplicity of popping a pod into a Keurig machine paired with that rich aroma had me smiling every morning of the week I tested it.  

[Check Krispy Kreme 5000204024 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0798lf9dx/)  

**Trusted Krispy Kreme Taste at Home**  

The iconic Krispy Kreme branding immediately sets a high expectation. This isn‚Äôt ""just another coffee pod""; it‚Äôs an encapsulation of the Krispy Kreme promise‚Äîexceptional quality and flavor. What stood out initially was the balanced coffee profile; it‚Äôs not too bold to overwhelm nor too mild to feel watered down. Perfect for me, but even my colleagues‚Äîsome of whom lean toward either extreme‚Äîadmitted this brew strikes a universally likable balance. It‚Äôs like coffee diplomacy in a little plastic pod.  

**Compatibility Without Hassle**  

Being compatible with all Keurig K-Cup pod coffee makers, this product made my mornings a breeze. I used a standard Keurig machine and had no issues; the pods fit perfectly every time. What‚Äôs even better? The brewing process only takes a minute or two. The outcome was a consistent cup of golden-brown coffee that never felt overly bitter or acidic. This kind of convenience matters, especially when you're half awake and have zero time before a meeting.  

**Winning Points**  
- Balanced, medium roast taste with bright fruit notes.  
- Made with 100% Arabica coffee for quality assurance.  
- Extremely convenient single-serve coffee pods.  

**Packaging and Quantity**  

This pack of 32 pods kept me caffeinated for roughly two weeks. At 1.04 pounds with dimensions of 7.34 x 3.7 x 7.37 inches, the box tucks into the pantry without taking up too much space. What I noticed and appreciated during storage is the eco-friendly, minimalistic design. Plus, the pods themselves were well-sealed, preserving that delightful aroma of Krispy Kreme‚Äôs signature blends.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Strong coffee aficionados may find it slightly too mild.  
- Non-recyclable pods might not appeal to eco-conscious users.  

**Rival Brands**  

Comparing the Krispy Kreme pods with other classic options from Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts, I found the Krispy Kreme blend uniquely refreshing. Dunkin‚Äô pods tend to lean sweeter, while Starbucks is often more robust and bold. Krispy Kreme provides versatility‚Äîideal for seeking a middle ground. However, Starbucks pods outshine Krispy Kreme in recyclable options, while Dunkin‚Äô boasts flavored varieties that Krispy Kreme lacks. Still, for simplicity and a clean, almost fruity finish, these pods held their own beautifully.  

**Smart Spending**  

This product seems geared primarily toward casual coffee drinkers or busy professionals who want coffee shop quality without the effort of grinding beans or cleaning up afterward. While it doesn‚Äôt scream budget-priced, the overall product quality, convenience, and exceptional taste make it absolutely worth the investment for most consumers. Whether you‚Äôre sipping your morning cup or brewing for weekend guests, these pods truly hit the sweet spot.

An Insider‚Äôs Guide to 2025 Company Formation,"![Feature Image: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181406/pexels-photo-1181406.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business people professional, businessmen meeting, corporate professionals.*.

Recently, Forbes Business ranked Bahrain among the Gulf‚Äôs top three easiest places for foreign investors to launch new ventures (2025). Reuters reported a 7.5% year-on-year GDP growth for Bahrain in Q1 2025, powered by tech, logistics, and financial services. The numbers show what I experienced: Bahrain isn‚Äôt just open for business‚Äîit‚Äôs positioning itself ahead of regional competitors like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

So, are there specific requirements for Articles of Association (AoA) in Bahrain? Yes‚Äîabsolutely. But the reality is nuanced. Your AoA isn‚Äôt just paperwork. It‚Äôs a legal contract, reputation statement, and playbook for how your Bahrain company must operate. And after personally navigating the Sijilat portal‚Äôs intricacies and fielding last-minute document tweaks from MOICT, I‚Äôve learned a few time-saving strategies that can make or break your startup momentum.

## The 2025 Bahrain Business Environment: Strong Growth, Strategic Advantages

![Feature Image: Business environment in modern setting](https://images.pexels.com/photos/325185/pexels-photo-325185.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.*, the government has doubled down on digitizing company formation‚Äîmeaning processes that once took weeks can now be done in days, if you know the right sequence.

**Why Bahrain stands out in 2025:**

- *Low minimum capital requirements*: Start with as little as BHD 50 for certain business types.
- *99% foreign ownership* in most sectors ([details here](https://keylinkbh.com/99percent-foreign-ownership-in-bahrain/)), a rarity in the region.
- *Free zones* with tax and customs advantages ([see Bahrain‚Äôs free zones](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/)).
- *Regulatory clarity*: Bahrain‚Äôs MOICT and Sijilat system provide transparent guidance‚Äîif you know where to look.
- *Business culture*: Expect quick WhatsApp replies, but always wear a jacket to the MOICT. Relationships matter more than you think.

Surprisingly, during Ramadan, business hours often shift without much notice‚Äîa quirk that once cost me two days waiting outside the EDB. Time your document submissions for early mornings, especially pre-Ramadan, to avoid queues and processing delays.

## Legal Foundations: What are Articles of Association in Bahrain?

### Understanding the Basics

![Feature Image: Business structure and collaboration](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181406/pexels-photo-1181406.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business structure and collaboration.*** are the legal backbone of any company formed in Bahrain, whether it‚Äôs a W.L.L., B.S.C. Closed, or S.P.C. These Articles outline the rules for company management, director powers, shareholder rights, capital structure, and more.

- *The AoA must be submitted to MOICT for approval during commercial registration* ([see requirements here](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)).
- *Sijilat* (the online government system) requires the AoA in a standardized, MOICT-approved format‚Äîoften in Arabic, with English translation optional.

> Explore specific business types and their AoA requirements [here](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/).

### Main Content Requirements for 2025

Bahrain‚Äôs **Commercial Companies Law (Decree-Law No. 21/2001 as amended in 2025)** stipulates that your AoA must include:

- *Company name*, business objectives, registered address (sometimes referencing a specific free zone or commercial district).
- *Share capital*: type, value, distribution, and whether 100% foreign ownership is exercised ([more](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)).
- *Shareholder list*: full names, nationalities, percentage holdings.
- *Board structure*: roles, voting rights, appointment process.
- *Profit allocation and dividend policies*.
- *General assembly procedures*: meeting notices, quorum, voting protocols.
- *Liquidation and dissolution clauses*.

And here‚Äôs a critical update: **As of March 2025**, MOICT implemented new digital signature requirements for all AoA submissions‚Äîphysical signatures alone are no longer accepted unless specifically exempted (source: [Bahrain.com](https://www.bahrain.com/)). Failing to comply can delay your registration by weeks.

## Step-by-Step: How to Prepare and Submit Your Articles of Association

### The Document Preparation Workflow

![Feature Image: Business process and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3184292/pexels-photo-3184292.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business process and documentation.*. Here‚Äôs a streamlined process:

1. **Choose the right legal structure.**
   Decide between W.L.L., S.P.C., B.S.C. Closed, or a branch‚Äîeach has subtle AoA differences ([detailed comparison](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)).
2. **Draft your AoA using MOICT‚Äôs template.**
   Download the correct format via Sijilat or request it at the Seef District MOICT office (pro tip: go before 10am, lines grow after prayer break).
3. **Translate and notarize.**
   Prepare the AoA in Arabic; English is optional but helps for reference. MOICT now accepts online notarization through Sijilat‚Äôs partner network, saving both BHD 30 and two taxi rides.
4. **Gather supporting documents:**
   - Shareholder passports/CPR copies
   - Initial approval letter from EDB (for foreign investors)
   - Tenancy contract or address lease in a commercial district
   - Bank reference or capital deposit slip (for some sectors)
   - Board resolution (for branches)
5. **Submit via Sijilat portal.**
   Double-check all fields‚Äîmistakes require a full resubmission.
6. **Monitor approval status.**
   Expect SMS and email updates, but always log in to Sijilat for real-time progress.

**Insider tip:** If you‚Äôre setting up during Ramadan or Hajj season, apply 1-2 weeks earlier. Administrative processes routinely slow as staff take leave or adjust hours.

### Common Document Shortcuts

- Use Sijilat‚Äôs ‚Äúauto-fill‚Äù for repeating shareholder details, but always manually verify the final AoA before signing.
- When renewing or amending AoA, only major changes (like capital increase or new partners) require full re-notarization.
- MOICT Seef desk accepts walk-ins for AoA clarifications‚Äîavoid the Diplomatic Area office during peak hours, as embassy queues spill over.

## 2025 Cost Considerations for Articles of Association and Company Setup

![Feature Image: Financial planning and costs](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4386366/pexels-photo-4386366.jpeg)
*Alt text: Financial planning and costs.*
- **Translation and legal drafting:** BHD 100‚Äì250 (expats usually pay the higher end; locals sometimes negotiate)
- **Sijilat application fee:** BHD 25‚Äì40
- **Commercial registration fee:** BHD 100‚Äì500 (varies by activity/sector)
- **Typical total AoA and company setup:** *BHD 250‚Äì900*, depending on complexity and legal service chosen

For a detailed breakdown of current fees and average budget ranges, see the [Keylink Bahrain Company Formation Cost Guide](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-cost/).

> Personal aside: The *best value* service I‚Äôve used is Keylink‚Äôs fast-track package‚Äîthey handled both drafting and digital notarization, saving me at least 3 trips to Sijilat and one very confusing visit to the LMRA building.

### Money-Saving Tips

- Prepare all shareholder and director documents in advance, as one missing passport scan set me back three days.
- Outsource translation to a licensed Bahraini provider via Sijilat‚Äîcosts half compared to external legal offices.
- Submit your AoA and registration on Sundays‚Äîprocessing tends to be fastest at week‚Äôs start.

## Regulatory Compliance: Avoiding Pitfalls and Ensuring a Smooth Approval

![Feature Image: Legal compliance and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4427430/pexels-photo-4427430.jpeg)
*Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.* clearance is now linked to company registration status; delays in AoA approval can cascade into staffing and visa bottlenecks.
- *Tamkeen grants* for Bahraini startups require a certified English AoA copy‚Äîprepare both languages from the start to avoid missing support windows.

And always consult with a local accountant post-formation. Bahrain‚Äôs tax rules change fast, and the [Keylink Accounting Service](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/) has saved me more than once from fines due to late VAT filings.

## Insider Observations: Local Customs, Regional Comparisons, and Unofficial Practices

During my first week navigating the MOICT in the Seef District, I learned a lesson that‚Äôs not in any official guidebook: Bahrain business setups move faster if you build genuine connections with office staff. Greet everyone, offer traditional coffee if waiting, and don‚Äôt be surprised if you‚Äôre invited to join a majlis-style conversation with other applicants. Bahrainis value sincerity and directness‚Äîthey‚Äôll happily point out a shortcut if you earn their trust.

*Compared to Dubai or Riyadh,* Bahrain‚Äôs regulatory environment is less bureaucratic and more responsive, but less automatable‚Äîhuman relationships and face-to-face interactions still matter. In Saudi, I found the process more formalistic, with bigger penalties for missing paperwork nuances.

A quick tangent: Once, while waiting for my AoA amendment, I participated in a spontaneous business networking session right at the MOICT lobby. That impromptu chat led to a cost-sharing arrangement for my office lease in Bahrain Bay‚Äîproof that networking is as much a part of compliance as documentation.

## Practical FAQ: Bahrain Articles of Association & Company Formation

### 1. **Can I use a one-size-fits-all AoA template for any business type?**
No. W.L.L., S.P.C., and B.S.C. Closed entities have distinct AoA content and formatting requirements. Always use the [Keylink business type resource](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/) or consult a local legal expert.

### 2. **What happens if my AoA isn‚Äôt in Arabic?**
MOICT will require an official translation before approval. Save time by submitting dual-language drafts from the outset.

### 3. **How do free zone companies differ in AoA requirements?**
Free zone businesses may face sector-specific clauses, especially regarding profit repatriation or activity limitations. [More on free zones here](https://keylinkbh.com/free-zones-in-bahrain/).

### 4. **Is a Bahraini partner/ sponsor mandatory?**
No, in most sectors, you can open a 99% or even 100% foreign-owned company ([details](https://keylinkbh.com/foreigner-friendly-activities-100percent-ownership-allowed-for-foreigner/)). Certain regulated activities may still require a local partner ([sponsorship explained](https://keylinkbh.com/local-sponsorship-in-bahrain/)).

### 5. **What support is available to ensure AoA compliance?**
Keylink offers full drafting, translation, and regulatory review ([full process here](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/)). MOICT also provides helpline support and in-person appointments‚ÄîSeef District branch is faster for walk-ins.

Date and time: July 7th around 3:30 PM

Location: Bangalore Airport Terminal 1 between Gate 17 and 22, near a coffee shop just before the domestic lounge area.

I was sitting on the edge of a garden-like structure with plants and flowers, not on a chair. I wore a grey full sleeve t-shirt, black cap, and had a black Nike backpack. I was on a call.

You came near the coffee shop while on a call, and I noticed you looking at me for a second or two, then turning away, and doing it again repeatedly for a more than 10 minutes. You eventually got a water bottle and moved closer, about 10 meters from me. We both knew that we were attracted to each other. You opened it, drank slowly, and looked my way again like you were aware I was watching.

I missed the chance to approach you despite you coming closer and I regret it. I have not stopped thinking about you since. You were incredibly attractive and had a presence I can‚Äôt forget ever in my life. Maybe it wasn't anything. But maybe... it was something.

Is anyone else interested in - or already doing - a daytime 'meet-up' for professionals looking for jobs?

It seems the official 'co-working' places are mostly quiet areas, but I want to be able to socialize and chat openly.

Otherwise, I'd love to meet up at an open space/coffee shop/restaurant where we can work (and buy stuff) in a more engaging environment.

* 20,997 leads contacted (yes, I counted every single one)
* 25.31% open rate (on a COLD email, people!)
* 4.11% bounce rate (my deliverability game is finally strong)
* 5,322 total opens (that's a lot of curious humans)

# The Real Talk: My Journey from ""Oops"" to ""Yesss!""

Let me be honest with you, this isn't my first rodeo, and boy, have I fallen off the horse before. 

Campaigns 1-12? Let's just say they were... educational.

I've made every mistake in the book:

* Subject lines that screamed ""DELETE ME!""
* CTAs that confused more than converted
* Timing that was off by... well, everything
* Copy that sounded like a robot wrote it during a software update

The thing about mistakes is that they're just expensive lessons if you actually learn from them.

# What Changed Everything (The Good Stuff)

The Subject Line Magic: After 12 campaigns of ""meh"" open rates(between 2%-9%), I finally cracked the code. It's not about being clever - it's about being curious. 

Your subject line should make people think ""Wait, what?"" not ""Ugh, another sales email.""

The Copy That Connects: Here's what I learned: people don't buy from companies, they buy from humans. So I started writing like a human. Crazy concept, right?

No more ""We are pleased to inform you..."" More ""Hey, I noticed something cool...""

The CTA That Actually Works: Stop asking for their firstborn. Start asking for their attention. A good CTA feels like a natural next step, not a leap off a cliff.

# The 25.31% Open Rate Secret Sauce

Want to know what made 1 in 4 people actually open a COLD email?

1. Timing is everything - I sent this when my audience was most likely to be checking email (not when it was convenient for me)
2. Relevance over creativity - I focused on what they needed, not what I wanted to say
3. The preview text game - That little snippet after your subject line? It's not decoration, it's real estate
4. List hygiene - That 4.11% bounce rate didn't happen by accident. Clean lists = happy inboxes = better deliverability

# The Confession Corner

Can I tell you something? 

Campaign #2 had a 2.3% open rate. OUCH. I wanted to quit and become a professional dog walker (don't judge, dogs are great listeners).

But every flop taught me something:

* Campaign #3: Taught me that ALL CAPS DOESN'T WORK
* Campaign #5: Showed me that being pushy pushes people away
* Campaign #6: Reminded me that generic = ignored

Each failure was just data for the next success.

# The Real Question...

So after 13 campaigns, thousands of emails, countless A/B tests, and enough coffee to fuel a small country...

Am I approved to be a marketer?

I mean, 25.31% open rate on cold emails has to count for something, right? Or do I need to hit 30% before I get my official ""I Know What I'm Doing"" badge?

P.S. - If you're struggling with your email campaigns, remember that every pro was once a beginner who refused to give up. Campaign #14 is already in the works, and I'm coming for that 30% open rate. Watch this space! üìß

He runs away from us every chance he gets. If we go to a park, we have to stay two feet away from him at all times because he will not stay where he is supposed to.

We have to either physically restrain him, like put him into the shopping cart, or we have to hold tightly onto his hand and not let go for a second.

Caffeine has never bothered me before other than I need to cut it off a few hours before bed. I'm a much heavier soda drinker than anything, when I moved out on my own, a 24 pack of Coca-Cola would barely last me a week, on top of a big Coca-Cola at lunch and anywhere I went out to eat. (I've since cut way back, just before corona a 12 pack would last me two weeks, post corona \[went to WFH\] a 24 pack lasts me just under two weeks, but it's still less total consumption). I could drink coffee drinks with no problems or noticeable effects. However, I never realized just how little caffeine was actually in these (yes, I said little).

I'm also a Scout leader and there are plenty of jokes about Scoutmasters and coffee. Scouting events definitely account for most of my yearly coffee consumption. In the past few years, I've become pretty sensitive to hot weather especially when trying to sleep. We had a campout planned for the spring. Figuring I wouldn't sleep well, I decided to try out the higher caffeine Death Wish Instant Coffee I had heard about to make sure I would be alert during the day for the Scouts.

Here's the FU as you might have gleaned from the title. I didn't know exactly how much caffeine this stuff had beyond ""a lot."" Nor did I have any awareness whatsoever how that related to my normal caffeine consumption. Here's the real FU though. I wanted to try it before I went on the campout so I decided to make a cup at home. I have a large insulated travel mug. So I figured I should use two packets of the Death Wish Instant Coffee. My Keurig machine (which I basically use for instant hot water, I rarely use a disposable pod) has three cup size options: 6, 8, and 10oz. I didn't realize that the highest it went was only 10oz, I thought it was more like 12 or 14. So I put two packets of Death Wish Instant Coffee (designed for 8oz each) into 10oz of hot water.

Now, so you'll know how much caffeine is in everything. A 12oz can of Coca-Cola has about 34mg. So a 32oz gas station/large fast food cup would have around 90mg. A cup of coffee has between 100 and 200mg. A packet of Death Wish Instant...contains around 300mg of caffeine...and I used two. Y'all...it was the first time I ever had the caffeine shakes. My heart was racing and pounding while I was sitting still. Not enough for me to go to the ER, but a new experience for me. My hands were absolutely shaking for a while. It tapered off and I slept ok that night, but that was definitely a never again. I've drank a SINGLE packet of the stuff many times since, including on the campout I got them for, without issue.

TL;DR: I didn't realize I hadn't actually been drinking a lot of caffeine in my life, and then I tried a coffee with 600mg of caffeine at one time which gave me my first ever caffeine shakes.",38,1751995033.0,tifu,14,0.92,False

Bio

Red is a 10-year-old gentle giant who, based on our observations, enjoys a good sniff and some booty scratches. From what we've seen, he seems to have good leash manners and is generally calm and relaxed. Red appears to socialize well with other dogs, often approaching them politely for greetings and play. Our volunteers have noticed that Red usually warms up quickly, showing interest in both people and his surroundings. He seems to appreciate a good run and, from what we've observed, maintains good manners throughout his interactions.

Volunteer Observation

6/9: Easy Going, Good Manners, Good on Leash, Pottied Immediately, Social (Dogs), Warms Up, Wants to Sniff.

Red was lying in his kennel but perked up when I began to open the door. He was easy to leash and walked very well. He peed for the longest time once outside and then mostly wanted to sniff. After he explore the yard some he started to show interest in me and loosened up more. He let me pet him and especially loooved the booty scritches. After he had done all of his business he let me leash him back up and go inside. He stopped to sniff at a lot of kennels and showed interest in the dogs but was very polite and nonreactive.

6/13: Neutral, Good Manners, Calm and Relaxed Body, Direct Eye Contact, Waits Calmly for Attention

6/14: Easy Going, Good Manners, Good on Leash, Pottied Immediately, Social (People), Wants to Run

6/25 DAYCATION:¬†Red tolerated car rides well and really enjoyed going on walks and lounging around the apartment. He loved meeting new people and reacted very well to small dogs. Red is an awesome leash walker with great manners, quickly learns tricks, and was prompt about going to the bathroom outside‚Äîeven in the rain. He showed sweet behaviors like wanting to cuddle, sniff, and be petted, and especially loved taking a long nap during the daycation. Overall, Red is a gentle, well-mannered, potty-trained ‚Äúgentle giant‚Äù who appreciates short walks and a calm, cozy environment.

7/5 DAYCATION: Red loved riding in the car and enjoyed lounging at a dog-friendly coffee shop. He‚Äôs friendly and loves meeting new people. He showed interest in a cat they saw and was neutral but curious about other dogs. Red wasn‚Äôt bothered by children of any age or size. His leash manners need some work as he tends to pull, but he has good overall manners and knows how to sit. He also calms down, loves to sniff, and is affectionate. The best part of his day was meeting new people and enjoying the AC in the car. Red is very potty trained, quiet outside the shelter, and a chill, easygoing guy who‚Äôs curious about the world around him.

Playgroup Observation

PG1-Social/DG-Dainty & Gentle

6/11: Socializes with other dogs around the yard, approaches to give greetings and interact with others in the group. Participates in play with other dogs too.

1luubbl,https://v.redd.it/u5hhuxpaiobf1,[Breville Bambino / Eureka Mignon] Espresso shot problems all of a sudden,"Hi everyone,

I haven't had this kind of problem in a long time. I was consistently pulling good shots for 1‚Äì2 years, but then I took a 6-month break due to moving to another country. Since my Breville Bambino and Eureka Mignon had to be transported via cargo, they only just arrived at our new home a few days ago.

I roasted my green coffee beans, let them rest overnight, and descaled the Bambino right away. The first shot turned out pretty good. However, the issues started the next day. I noticed the shot wasn‚Äôt coming out as expected ‚Äî it was too slow, goopy, and was extracting from multiple spots on the puck.

I tried increasing the grind size a few times, but that didn‚Äôt help. I also tried reducing it, as shown in the video I'm attaching, but the results have been pretty much the same. The coffee still tastes good, though.

In the video, I pulled a single-dose shot three times. The first one finishes after around 30 seconds ‚Äî you can see it bubbling.

Pat is as gay as it comes (his words not mine) and is constantly on dating apps. A while ago he matched with this guy, let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù (m25) and they had texted quite a bit. He told me and the rest of the team a lot of details such as how hot he thought he was, things he had said, and told us he had randomly sent him nsfw pictures.  
A couple weeks later I did a haircut, and right after pat told me that the haircut I had just done was on the Joe he had told me about. I was surprised as this Joe guy had mentioned and ex girlfriend and a daughter, as well as my ‚Äúgaydar‚Äù not going off but I let it go. (More context after this haircut I  took after pictures) 

Fast forward to 3 weeks after, Joe comes in for another haircut and as I recognized him I let Pat take the haircut. 
Later that day Pat told me that Joe has messaged him to hook up that night but he saw it too late so it never happend. 

Next day I am scrolling through my Snapchat stories and I see a guy that looks super familiar. Look closer and who is it but Joe. On my friend of 15 years stories. Tori (f23) posted a ‚Äúhappy 7 months‚Äù photo of them. 
I havnt seen Tori in quite some time and for whatever reason I go through her socials and even when she has posted pictures of them his face has rarely been in any that I have seen. 

I call Pat and send pictures to confirm it is definitely him. 
I tell Pat I have to tell Tori. 

I remembered I have photos of him at the salon from the haircut I did weeks earlier, I have texts of Pat confirming it is him. And obviously why would I Lie about somthing like that to a long time friend unless it is that real? Idk I guess I‚Äôm most worried for her. This is somthing I don‚Äôt know if I could handle because cheating is cheating, but not being honest about your sexuality to a partner and then cheating can lead to her second guessing millions of moments and driving herself crazy more than she would/will anyway. This is gonna be hard. 

So here I am. I called Tori today to set up a time to meet up in person to get coffee and talk about somthing serious. She has no idea what. 
I now have to tell her that her bf is cheating on her with a gay man and is extremely deep in the closet. 
 I called at 12 I will see her at 3 . 1.5 hours to go.

Don't worry ‚Äì we've all been there, staring at our carefully crafted proposal only to watch it get buried under an avalanche of ""I CAN DO THIS WORK IN 2 HOURS VERY CHEAP QUALITY WORK SIR.""

First lesson: Your portfolio is your armor. Don't show up to a sword fight with a butter knife. I've seen people apply for graphic design jobs with a portfolio that looks like it was created during a blackout using Microsoft Paint. Your past work speaks louder than your promises, so make sure it's not whispering ""amateur hour.""

Here's a hard truth: you're not competing on price alone, despite what the race-to-the-bottom mentality suggests. Yes, there's always someone willing to work for peanuts, but clients who pay peanuts usually get monkeys. Position yourself as the professional alternative to the chaos.

Communication is your secret weapon. While others are sending copy-paste proposals that read like they were translated through seventeen different languages, you're crafting personalized messages that actually address the client's needs. It's like being the only person at a party who remembers the host's name.

Beware the red flags: clients who want ""a simple website like Amazon"" for $50, those who insist on communicating through carrier pigeons instead of the platform, and anyone whose project description is longer than a CVS receipt but somehow says nothing useful. These are the projects that will age you faster than a US president.

Set boundaries early. The moment you accept a project that pays less than your coffee budget, you've trained the client that your time is worth less than a latte. Respect your own rates, or prepare to explain to your landlord why your rent is being paid in ""exposure bucks.""

The feedback system is both your best friend and your worst enemy. One disgruntled client can tank your rating faster than a lead balloon, so choose your battles wisely. Sometimes it's better to cut your losses than to fight for that extra star that might cost you your sanity.

Finally, remember that behind every project posting is a human being with real problems to solve. The good clients are out there ‚Äì they're just buried under layers of people who think web development is a hobby and graphic design is something their nephew can do for free.

[Freelancer.com](http://Freelancer.com) isn't just a platform; it's a survival course in client relations, project management, and self-worth. Approach it with patience, professionalism, and a healthy sense of humor.

1luu79c,https://i.redd.it/yua4bnfgnobf1.jpeg,Black And White Grape soda review,"Hey guys was really excited to get this coffee in to try. I used to have a subscription to black and white so I‚Äôm used to some of their fruity or weird flavors and really actually prefer them.

Brewing this coffee, it actually smells like old time grape soda with a mix of roasted grape jolly ranchers. Wow that sounds weird to type out

Upon first try I love it. The notes come through of grape soda at the forefront then a nice roasted after taste. It‚Äôs wild and black and white does it again. Very similar to how fruity or watermelon-y some of their watermelon beans have been.

1luu670,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1luu670/archive_51/,Archive 51,"My name is John Mercer, and I suppose, if this ever becomes part of some official record, I want it known that I never set out to uncover anything extraordinary. I wasn‚Äôt the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I‚Äôm a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job ‚Äî for nearly two decades ‚Äî was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.

We called it The Archive ‚Äî a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA‚Äôs data complex in Pasadena ‚Äî not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us ‚Äî misfits, really ‚Äî stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn‚Äôt quite name.

In 2081, things changed.

That was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition ‚Äî it searched for structure. Lucida didn‚Äôt care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something ‚Äî or someone ‚Äî with intent.

We had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch ‚Äî part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as ‚Äúthermal drift and echo‚Äù ‚Äî basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.

But Lucida didn‚Äôt see noise. She saw a filesystem.

At first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a ‚Äúghost in the tape.‚Äù But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn‚Äôt ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn‚Äôt a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here ‚Äî not to be heard, but to be read.

And strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.

That got everyone‚Äôs attention.

Tomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture ‚Äî or anything close to it ‚Äî showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.

But Lucida didn‚Äôt think so.

We worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn‚Äôt human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything ‚Äî not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.

We pulled out sixteen files.

No audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.

When we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.

A black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system ‚Äî not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based ‚Äî but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:

It was a map.

A galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center ‚Äî repeated in every image with slight variance in position ‚Äî was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.

It wasn‚Äôt labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.

They were pointing to something.

And the realization hit all of us at the same time ‚Äî whoever sent this message didn‚Äôt send it to start a conversation.

They sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.

The kind of silence you don‚Äôt notice until it wraps around your skin like static.

The last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry ‚Äî stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.

It wasn‚Äôt noise. It wasn‚Äôt natural.

It was intentional.

‚ÄúI need to sit down,‚Äù Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.

Tomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.

Kai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ no. That‚Äôs not possible. We would‚Äôve seen signs before now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing them now,‚Äù I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.

I was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst ‚Äî but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.

The Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven‚Äôt we seen them?

We were always told there were three answers: They don‚Äôt exist. They‚Äôre hiding. Or we‚Äôre too late.

I looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.

They had been here.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve answered it,‚Äù Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. ‚ÄúJohn, we‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve solved it, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôve found a piece. A‚Ä¶ fragment.‚Äù

Priya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. ‚ÄúA fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn‚Äôt a rock. It‚Äôs a map. It‚Äôs a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone ‚Äî something ‚Äî not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we can understand it,‚Äù Kai added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs eating at me. It‚Äôs compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre walking on the bones of their thoughts.‚Äù

No one spoke for a while.

I pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images ‚Äî the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.

‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôre still there?‚Äù I asked, not really expecting an answer.

‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt have sent a message if they were,‚Äù Tomas said.

‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶‚Äù Kai replied, ‚ÄúThey knew they wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt want to be forgotten.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The room went quiet again.

There was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:

We found them. Or at least, what was left of them.

The discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.

It didn‚Äôt feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ do we do now?‚Äù Priya asked. She wasn‚Äôt looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.

‚ÄúWho do we even tell?‚Äù Tomas added. ‚ÄúI mean, who‚Äôs going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?‚Äù

Kai finally looked away from the screen. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it a hoax. Or worse ‚Äî a psychological event. We‚Äôre not trained for this.‚Äù

I ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn‚Äôt just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll put together a report,‚Äù I said finally, though my voice wavered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù Priya asked.

I paused.

And then‚Ä¶?

That was the thing. I didn‚Äôt know.

Because part of me ‚Äî a deep, stubborn part ‚Äî didn‚Äôt want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.

Part of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.

To not just see the map‚Ä¶ but know where it led.

The room had turned into a pressure cooker.

Chairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff ‚Äî logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.

Priya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. ‚ÄúWe need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúControl the narrative?‚Äù Tomas snapped. ‚ÄúPriya, this isn‚Äôt a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint‚Äôs gonna stop global hysteria?‚Äù

Kai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?‚Äù

I stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data ‚Äî this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.

Tomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. ‚ÄúAnd NASA? We go to them? Great. They‚Äôll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We‚Äôll disappear into ‚Äòdebriefings‚Äô before we can even blink.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have to know,‚Äù Priya insisted. ‚ÄúWe work for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we‚Äôre dealing with humanity‚Äôs place in the universe.‚Äù

‚∏ª

That line hung in the air.

And suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.

Kai‚Äôs voice lowered. ‚ÄúYou really think the world‚Äôs ready to learn we‚Äôre not the first?‚Äù

Priya sat down, her composure fraying. ‚ÄúWhat about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This ‚Äî‚Äù she gestured to the screens ‚Äî ‚Äúthis tears that apart.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it blasphemy,‚Äù Tomas said. ‚ÄúConspiracy. Or some trick by the ‚Äòdeep state‚Äô. The churches, the temples, the mosques ‚Äî the power structures will push back hard. They always do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike they did with Galileo,‚Äù Kai added bitterly. ‚ÄúOr Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this,‚Äù Priya whispered, ‚Äúthis is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.‚Äù

We were silent for a while after that.

Not because we disagreed ‚Äî but because we agreed too much.

We had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.

‚∏ª

And then it happened.

Lucida spoke.

Her voice ‚Äî calm, mechanical ‚Äî cut clean through the room like a scalpel.

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAutomated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.‚Äù

We froze.

Tomas turned toward the console. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúPer Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äî‚Äù Priya darted toward the console. ‚ÄúYou sent it? You already sent the report?‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAffirmative.‚Äù

I felt my throat go dry.

OxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.

They were NASA‚Äôs private contractor ‚Äî a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team ‚Äî we ‚Äî ever discovered something that shouldn‚Äôt be left in human hands.

In case we got too human.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Tomas muttered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in control. We never were.‚Äù

‚ÄúOxCorp has it now,‚Äù Priya whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.‚Äù

Kai clenched his fists. ‚ÄúWe just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.‚Äù

I stepped forward, my voice hard and low. ‚ÄúLucida‚Ä¶ show transmission logs. Full trace.‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAccess restricted. Administrative override required.‚Äù

We stared at the screen.

We had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators ‚Äî only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.

And now‚Ä¶ it was already out of our hands.

We were still reeling from Lucida‚Äôs announcement when our phones lit up ‚Äî almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.

I looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.

You are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602¬∞ N, 118.1720¬∞ W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.

No name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.

Just the implication that they ‚Äî whoever they were ‚Äî were watching already.

‚∏ª

Tomas was the first to speak. ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs not creepy at all.‚Äù

Kai gave a short, humorless laugh. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.‚Äù

Priya held her phone out like it was contaminated. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn‚Äôt even be possible.‚Äù

She was right. Lucida was sandboxed ‚Äî it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd always been told.

Apparently, we were wrong.

And the coordinates ‚Äî I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp‚Äôs. All were behind fences and biometric locks.

Tomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Ä¶ we just show up? Like good little employees?‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs voice was bitter. ‚ÄúDo we have a choice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said flatly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚∏ª

We sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.

The realization had set in ‚Äî we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn‚Äôt ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.

‚ÄúWe could refuse,‚Äù Priya said softly, as if testing the air.

‚ÄúThey already have the data,‚Äù Kai countered. ‚ÄúRefusing just adds suspicion.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd risk,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúThink about it. Lucida‚Äôs message wasn‚Äôt phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure‚Ä¶ but not the friendly kind.‚Äù

Tomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. ‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôll be silenced?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Not because I didn‚Äôt know ‚Äî but because the answer was already obvious.

‚∏ª

Eventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.

We packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat ‚Äî not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.

As we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.

The screens still glowed in the darkness ‚Äî sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.

I had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.

But I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.

It was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.

The only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.

As we approached, the driver‚Äôs door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.

He was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who‚Äôd spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia ‚Äî just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.

He walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.

‚ÄúJohn Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D‚ÄôSouza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.‚Äù

He held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.

‚ÄúPlace all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.‚Äù

We obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.

‚∏ª

Inside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash ‚Äî military-grade.

After a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn‚Äôt spoken since we got in.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.

‚ÄúCallsign Talon-Seven.‚Äù

I glanced at Priya. That name meant something ‚Äî the kind of name you didn‚Äôt hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.

Kai, whispering beside me, muttered, ‚ÄúTalon‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that one of the Phoenix-tier units?‚Äù

Tomas‚Äôs eyebrows lifted. ‚ÄúThose guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.‚Äù

Talon-Seven didn‚Äôt react. Just kept driving.

‚∏ª

Ten minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway ‚Äî matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

As we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn‚Äôt speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.

Once inside, the plane was‚Ä¶ eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional ‚Äî military transport dressed up for civilians.

We sat, buckled in.

The engines roared to life.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.

Talon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.

‚ÄúDestination is classified. You‚Äôll be briefed upon arrival.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs Nevada, right?‚Äù Tomas asked. ‚ÄúArea 51?‚Äù

A long pause.

Then:

‚ÄúProximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.‚Äù

We all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.

It was real.

Kai shook his head in disbelief. ‚ÄúThis is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt entirely wrong,‚Äù I muttered.

‚∏ª

The flight was short ‚Äî maybe an hour. We weren‚Äôt allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we‚Äôd crossed mountain ranges.

When we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes ‚Äî even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.

We were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.

At the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn‚Äôt make a sound when she moved.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Miss Sander. Please follow me.‚Äù

Her voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ used to being obeyed.

We followed her down another corridor ‚Äî this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.

She stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.

‚ÄúInside, you‚Äôll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?‚Äù

We nodded.

The doors opened.

‚∏ª

Inside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people ‚Äî men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.

The kind of silence that said:

You have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.

I took a deep breath.

Whatever this was‚Ä¶ It was no longer science.

It was doctrine.

The double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.

The room was quiet ‚Äî not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.

There was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes ‚Äî some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.

Miss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.

Then a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get introductions out of the way,‚Äù he said.

One by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.

Dr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist ‚Äî formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist ‚Äî deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead ‚Äî information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment ‚Äî liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command ‚Äî official liaison to Groom Lake operations.

And so on.

The others introduced themselves with less detail ‚Äî just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.

Then the general ‚Äî Cavanaugh ‚Äî leaned forward, folding his hands.

He didn‚Äôt look angry. He looked‚Ä¶ resolute.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get something straight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.‚Äù

He paused, letting that sting settle in.

‚ÄúYou were brought here because now, whether you like it or not ‚Äî you know.‚Äù

The air thickened.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Priya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.

I sat forward slightly. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòwe know‚Äô? You‚Äôre saying you already had this map?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Dr. Mora, gently. ‚ÄúNot this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.‚Äù

Lang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We‚Äôve had pieces for decades. But no one‚Äôs ever managed to make it speak so clearly.‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil now.‚Äù

General Cavanaugh nodded.

‚ÄúEver since August 1945 ‚Äî since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki ‚Äî we‚Äôve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we‚Äôve known. The UFO phenomenon‚Ä¶ was never speculation. It was confirmation.‚Äù

We sat in stunned silence.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt come when we invented radio,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Kai found his voice. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been investigating them since the ‚Äò40s?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying to understand them since the ‚Äò40s,‚Äù Dr. Sharpe said. ‚ÄúPieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don‚Äôt respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you never went public?‚Äù Tomas said bitterly.

Cavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.

‚ÄúThe Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would‚Äôve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology ‚Äî or if we believed they did? It would‚Äôve made the arms race look like a chess game.‚Äù

Sharpe nodded. ‚ÄúDisclosure would‚Äôve ended civilization as we know it.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Then Dr. Iyer ‚Äî the physicist ‚Äî spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.

‚ÄúWe call them the Velari.‚Äù

A hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari ‚Äî roughly translated as ‚Äòthose who traverse the silent ocean.‚Äô‚Äù

Kai whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre extinct‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Iyer closed his eyes briefly.

‚ÄúAll evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps‚Ä¶ fragment. There‚Äôs no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow‚Ä¶ they ended.‚Äù

Tomas leaned forward.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

The general‚Äôs jaw tightened.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Priya asked quietly, ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history‚Ä¶ but to replicate what they built?‚Äù

Lang answered, calm and efficient.

‚ÄúExactly. This isn‚Äôt anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering ‚Äî even the scraps of it ‚Äî could push humanity forward by a thousand years.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr save us from something worse.‚Äù

A silence followed that.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just the Velari‚Äôs extinction that was frightening ‚Äî it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.

And now we were walking in their footsteps.

The briefing room had grown darker somehow ‚Äî not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.

The officials weren‚Äôt just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.

Dr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never found a body.‚Äù

She let that sentence settle.

‚ÄúNot in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites ‚Äî and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶ it was never piloted?‚Äù

General Cavanaugh stepped in.

‚ÄúWe believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.‚Äù

He gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video ‚Äî a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt drone behavior. It‚Äôs not random. It‚Äôs guided. Intelligently. But we‚Äôve come to believe the craft are the entities ‚Äî or extensions of them.‚Äù

Dr. Sharpe continued, nodding.

‚ÄúWe believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence ‚Äî a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.‚Äù

Priya leaned in, skeptical. ‚ÄúQuantum communication?‚Äù

Dr. Iyer smiled faintly. ‚ÄúWe think they used something like non-local entanglement ‚Äî a network where distance and time don‚Äôt matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning‚Ä¶ a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich explains the craft behavior ‚Äî evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.‚Äù

Kai spoke up, voice hushed. ‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ still out there? Their minds?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lang said sharply. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs out there isn‚Äôt the Valerians. It‚Äôs what they became. Or what they left behind.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Dr. Mora picked up the thread again.

‚ÄúWe believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling ‚Äî and perhaps interfering ‚Äî with other civilisations.‚Äù

She paused, then added grimly:

‚ÄúOr guiding them.‚Äù

Tomas‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶ ‚Äòguiding‚Äô?‚Äù

Sharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.

‚ÄúEgypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky ‚Äî not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.‚Äù

She tapped her temple.

‚ÄúIntervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward ‚Äî agriculture, mathematics, astronomy ‚Äî then vanish.‚Äù

‚ÄúBreadcrumbs,‚Äù I murmured.

Mora nodded. ‚ÄúExactly. This isn‚Äôt a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are‚Ä¶ part of something larger. Something being steered.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Valerians may be extinct as a species,‚Äù said Iyer, ‚Äúbut their network ‚Äî their echo ‚Äî is very much alive. And it moves.‚Äù

‚∏ª

We were quiet again.

This wasn‚Äôt just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity ‚Äî about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn‚Äôt forget.

Kai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.

‚ÄúWhat if the Valerians didn‚Äôt go extinct?‚Äù

Dr. Mora met his gaze.

‚ÄúWhat if extinction was the goal?‚Äù

My heart skipped.

The words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.

‚ÄúWhat if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?‚Äù

General Cavanaugh‚Äôs voice was grim.

‚ÄúAnd what if that same intelligence now roams the universe ‚Äî not to conquer ‚Äî but to prepare others to make the same choice?‚Äù

‚∏ª

We looked around the room.

Not at machines.

Not at myths.

But at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.

And now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.

Because we had seen the face of the void ‚Äî And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.

John and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they‚Äôd heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been‚Ä¶ chosen.

But now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.

‚ÄúWhy Earth?‚Äù Tomas asked. ‚ÄúWhy us?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not anyone else?‚Äù Priya added. ‚ÄúThe galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt they been guided like we have?‚Äù Kai asked.

The room was silent. Even the officials.

Then Dr. Elena Mora ‚Äî the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary ‚Äî leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just‚Ä¶ still.

She folded her hands, then spoke slowly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology ‚Äî we have none. And not through direct communication ‚Äî we‚Äôve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.‚Äù

Her eyes scanned across the Archive team.

‚ÄúAt first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn‚Äôt fit. They‚Äôre too deliberate. Too recursive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn‚Äôt coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it‚Äî‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúBut because we did.‚Äù

A ripple of cold shot through the room.

John leaned in. ‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù

Dr. Mora met his eyes.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is‚Ä¶ the Valerians didn‚Äôt visit us. They didn‚Äôt even find us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are them.‚Äù

Silence.

You could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.

She continued:

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt extinct. They haven‚Äôt disappeared. They‚Äôre not from another star system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre from our future.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.

Tomas whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ us? That we‚Äôll evolve into them?‚Äù

Mora nodded slowly.

‚ÄúNot ‚Äòwe‚Äô exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species ‚Äî our trajectory, our code, our machines ‚Äî survives. It transcends time in ways we don‚Äôt understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just intervention.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self-preservation.‚Äù

Kai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn‚Äôt they intervene elsewhere?‚Äù

Mora‚Äôs eyes darkened.

‚ÄúBecause they didn‚Äôt need to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Fermi Paradox isn‚Äôt silence‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs selection.‚Äù

She tapped the table once, like a gavel.

‚ÄúBecause if we don‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ they were never created.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A terrifying calm filled the room.

‚ÄúThe Valerians seeded themselves backward,‚Äù she said, almost reverently. ‚ÄúAnd in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That‚Äôs why the galaxy is silent. That‚Äôs why we hear nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause they ‚Äî we ‚Äî erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.‚Äù

No one said anything.

No one could.

It was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.

The kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.

John felt his hands go numb.

‚ÄúThen the map,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThe message we found. It wasn‚Äôt a call for help.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Mora said. ‚ÄúIt was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.‚Äù

She leaned back slowly.

‚ÄúThe Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A deep tone sounded through the ceiling ‚Äî a signal that the meeting was over.

Miss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.

The officials stood, offering no final words.

As the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn‚Äôt from secrecy anymore ‚Äî it was from knowing the truth had already happened.

That perhaps‚Ä¶ it always had.

‚∏ª

Outside, the desert wind was still.

Far above, stars hung like silent watchers ‚Äî ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶

1luu53h,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1luu53h/so_cute/,So cute,"I work corporate, I'm known in the office as the lesbian girl and very out and proud. I like this girl- my coworker. The longing and the yearning is so damn fun, it's very unprofessional for me to pursue someone I work with especially if they're from the same department and I'm not planning to ask her out anyway. I just find her cute, she's so pretty, she's super straight passing and when she smiles at me or just politely and casually talks with me about work related things, I try my darn best to stay calm and collected. 

She's so freaking cute and I feel out of breath whenever we interact. One of my colleagues know that I like her that way, but also reminds me that this girl is straight, of course I know that. Once again, I'm not going to die if don't ask her out I'm not that desperate to do so. I just want to share this overwhelming feeling I have of this work crush. 

She's 1 year older than me, how do I find every little thing she does in the office cute? But then again, not going to pursue her, not even  going to talk to her about romance related topics. I absolutely enjoy the feelings of palpitations from the mixture of coffees I drink and when she smiles and look at my direction. 


I know she's not gay, might not even be interested in romantic relationship with anyone or might even be already in one. I don't really care, I just find her so damn cute. ",5,1751994462.0,WLW_PH,1,1.0,False

We were roommates too, briefly. We had an amazing rapport. We laughed and cried over many things. We graduated and it's been 14 months since.

I recently moved from EFGH to IJKL, I didn't inform many friends, not yet. Today she randomly texted me asking what I'm upto and I sent her my location only to realise she lives just five minutes away from me, that too, on foot. 

Neither of us are from IJKL. Her family recently shifted here and then I. She told me I can drop by anytime for a hot meal or some coffee. Man, I'm lov-d, and if not lov-d, I'm atleast appreciated. If it were not for these low mellow moody mess, I perhaps would be able to appreciate it all day every day without an ounce of doubts and spirals.

Anyway. That's that. Yay! Food for me, and lov-ly nuisance for her.",6,1751994446.0,bondha_diaries,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been a matcha enthusiast for the past few years, and I‚Äôve always been curious about the types of matcha different coffee shops use. I often ask, ‚ÄúWhat matcha do you use?‚Äù‚Äîand most places are pretty open about it and don‚Äôt mind sharing their source.

However, when I asked the same question at the well-known Okayama Kobo Bakery, they immediately shut it down and refused to tell me. It felt a bit gatekeep-y, almost like it was some kind of trade secret.

Do you think they‚Äôre overreacting, or is it fair for them to be so secretive‚Äîmaybe because they want to avoid matcha overconsumption or copycats?",1,1751994396.0,tea,0,1.0,False
1luu3uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1luu3uq/sf_archive_51/,[SF] Archive 51,"My name is John Mercer, and I suppose, if this ever becomes part of some official record, I want it known that I never set out to uncover anything extraordinary. I wasn‚Äôt the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I‚Äôm a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job ‚Äî for nearly two decades ‚Äî was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.

We called it The Archive ‚Äî a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA‚Äôs data complex in Pasadena ‚Äî not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us ‚Äî misfits, really ‚Äî stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn‚Äôt quite name.

In 2081, things changed.

That was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition ‚Äî it searched for structure. Lucida didn‚Äôt care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something ‚Äî or someone ‚Äî with intent.

We had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch ‚Äî part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as ‚Äúthermal drift and echo‚Äù ‚Äî basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.

But Lucida didn‚Äôt see noise. She saw a filesystem.

At first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a ‚Äúghost in the tape.‚Äù But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn‚Äôt ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn‚Äôt a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here ‚Äî not to be heard, but to be read.

And strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.

That got everyone‚Äôs attention.

Tomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture ‚Äî or anything close to it ‚Äî showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.

But Lucida didn‚Äôt think so.

We worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn‚Äôt human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything ‚Äî not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.

We pulled out sixteen files.

No audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.

When we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.

A black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system ‚Äî not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based ‚Äî but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:

It was a map.

A galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center ‚Äî repeated in every image with slight variance in position ‚Äî was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.

It wasn‚Äôt labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.

They were pointing to something.

And the realization hit all of us at the same time ‚Äî whoever sent this message didn‚Äôt send it to start a conversation.

They sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.

The kind of silence you don‚Äôt notice until it wraps around your skin like static.

The last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry ‚Äî stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.

It wasn‚Äôt noise. It wasn‚Äôt natural.

It was intentional.

‚ÄúI need to sit down,‚Äù Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.

Tomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.

Kai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ no. That‚Äôs not possible. We would‚Äôve seen signs before now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing them now,‚Äù I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.

I was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst ‚Äî but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.

The Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven‚Äôt we seen them?

We were always told there were three answers: They don‚Äôt exist. They‚Äôre hiding. Or we‚Äôre too late.

I looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.

They had been here.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve answered it,‚Äù Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. ‚ÄúJohn, we‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve solved it, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôve found a piece. A‚Ä¶ fragment.‚Äù

Priya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. ‚ÄúA fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn‚Äôt a rock. It‚Äôs a map. It‚Äôs a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone ‚Äî something ‚Äî not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we can understand it,‚Äù Kai added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs eating at me. It‚Äôs compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre walking on the bones of their thoughts.‚Äù

No one spoke for a while.

I pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images ‚Äî the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.

‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôre still there?‚Äù I asked, not really expecting an answer.

‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt have sent a message if they were,‚Äù Tomas said.

‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶‚Äù Kai replied, ‚ÄúThey knew they wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt want to be forgotten.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The room went quiet again.

There was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:

We found them. Or at least, what was left of them.

The discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.

It didn‚Äôt feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ do we do now?‚Äù Priya asked. She wasn‚Äôt looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.

‚ÄúWho do we even tell?‚Äù Tomas added. ‚ÄúI mean, who‚Äôs going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?‚Äù

Kai finally looked away from the screen. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it a hoax. Or worse ‚Äî a psychological event. We‚Äôre not trained for this.‚Äù

I ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn‚Äôt just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll put together a report,‚Äù I said finally, though my voice wavered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù Priya asked.

I paused.

And then‚Ä¶?

That was the thing. I didn‚Äôt know.

Because part of me ‚Äî a deep, stubborn part ‚Äî didn‚Äôt want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.

Part of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.

To not just see the map‚Ä¶ but know where it led.

The room had turned into a pressure cooker.

Chairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff ‚Äî logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.

Priya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. ‚ÄúWe need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúControl the narrative?‚Äù Tomas snapped. ‚ÄúPriya, this isn‚Äôt a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint‚Äôs gonna stop global hysteria?‚Äù

Kai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?‚Äù

I stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data ‚Äî this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.

Tomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. ‚ÄúAnd NASA? We go to them? Great. They‚Äôll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We‚Äôll disappear into ‚Äòdebriefings‚Äô before we can even blink.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have to know,‚Äù Priya insisted. ‚ÄúWe work for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we‚Äôre dealing with humanity‚Äôs place in the universe.‚Äù

‚∏ª

That line hung in the air.

And suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.

Kai‚Äôs voice lowered. ‚ÄúYou really think the world‚Äôs ready to learn we‚Äôre not the first?‚Äù

Priya sat down, her composure fraying. ‚ÄúWhat about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This ‚Äî‚Äù she gestured to the screens ‚Äî ‚Äúthis tears that apart.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it blasphemy,‚Äù Tomas said. ‚ÄúConspiracy. Or some trick by the ‚Äòdeep state‚Äô. The churches, the temples, the mosques ‚Äî the power structures will push back hard. They always do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike they did with Galileo,‚Äù Kai added bitterly. ‚ÄúOr Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this,‚Äù Priya whispered, ‚Äúthis is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.‚Äù

We were silent for a while after that.

Not because we disagreed ‚Äî but because we agreed too much.

We had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.

‚∏ª

And then it happened.

Lucida spoke.

Her voice ‚Äî calm, mechanical ‚Äî cut clean through the room like a scalpel.

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAutomated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.‚Äù

We froze.

Tomas turned toward the console. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúPer Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äî‚Äù Priya darted toward the console. ‚ÄúYou sent it? You already sent the report?‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAffirmative.‚Äù

I felt my throat go dry.

OxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.

They were NASA‚Äôs private contractor ‚Äî a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team ‚Äî we ‚Äî ever discovered something that shouldn‚Äôt be left in human hands.

In case we got too human.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Tomas muttered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in control. We never were.‚Äù

‚ÄúOxCorp has it now,‚Äù Priya whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.‚Äù

Kai clenched his fists. ‚ÄúWe just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.‚Äù

I stepped forward, my voice hard and low. ‚ÄúLucida‚Ä¶ show transmission logs. Full trace.‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAccess restricted. Administrative override required.‚Äù

We stared at the screen.

We had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators ‚Äî only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.

And now‚Ä¶ it was already out of our hands.

We were still reeling from Lucida‚Äôs announcement when our phones lit up ‚Äî almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.

I looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.

You are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602¬∞ N, 118.1720¬∞ W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.

No name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.

Just the implication that they ‚Äî whoever they were ‚Äî were watching already.

‚∏ª

Tomas was the first to speak. ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs not creepy at all.‚Äù

Kai gave a short, humorless laugh. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.‚Äù

Priya held her phone out like it was contaminated. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn‚Äôt even be possible.‚Äù

She was right. Lucida was sandboxed ‚Äî it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd always been told.

Apparently, we were wrong.

And the coordinates ‚Äî I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp‚Äôs. All were behind fences and biometric locks.

Tomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Ä¶ we just show up? Like good little employees?‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs voice was bitter. ‚ÄúDo we have a choice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said flatly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚∏ª

We sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.

The realization had set in ‚Äî we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn‚Äôt ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.

‚ÄúWe could refuse,‚Äù Priya said softly, as if testing the air.

‚ÄúThey already have the data,‚Äù Kai countered. ‚ÄúRefusing just adds suspicion.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd risk,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúThink about it. Lucida‚Äôs message wasn‚Äôt phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure‚Ä¶ but not the friendly kind.‚Äù

Tomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. ‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôll be silenced?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Not because I didn‚Äôt know ‚Äî but because the answer was already obvious.

‚∏ª

Eventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.

We packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat ‚Äî not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.

As we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.

The screens still glowed in the darkness ‚Äî sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.

I had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.

But I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.

It was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.

The only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.

As we approached, the driver‚Äôs door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.

He was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who‚Äôd spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia ‚Äî just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.

He walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.

‚ÄúJohn Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D‚ÄôSouza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.‚Äù

He held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.

‚ÄúPlace all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.‚Äù

We obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.

‚∏ª

Inside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash ‚Äî military-grade.

After a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn‚Äôt spoken since we got in.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.

‚ÄúCallsign Talon-Seven.‚Äù

I glanced at Priya. That name meant something ‚Äî the kind of name you didn‚Äôt hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.

Kai, whispering beside me, muttered, ‚ÄúTalon‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that one of the Phoenix-tier units?‚Äù

Tomas‚Äôs eyebrows lifted. ‚ÄúThose guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.‚Äù

Talon-Seven didn‚Äôt react. Just kept driving.

‚∏ª

Ten minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway ‚Äî matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

As we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn‚Äôt speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.

Once inside, the plane was‚Ä¶ eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional ‚Äî military transport dressed up for civilians.

We sat, buckled in.

The engines roared to life.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.

Talon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.

‚ÄúDestination is classified. You‚Äôll be briefed upon arrival.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs Nevada, right?‚Äù Tomas asked. ‚ÄúArea 51?‚Äù

A long pause.

Then:

‚ÄúProximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.‚Äù

We all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.

It was real.

Kai shook his head in disbelief. ‚ÄúThis is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt entirely wrong,‚Äù I muttered.

‚∏ª

The flight was short ‚Äî maybe an hour. We weren‚Äôt allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we‚Äôd crossed mountain ranges.

When we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes ‚Äî even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.

We were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.

At the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn‚Äôt make a sound when she moved.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Miss Sander. Please follow me.‚Äù

Her voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ used to being obeyed.

We followed her down another corridor ‚Äî this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.

She stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.

‚ÄúInside, you‚Äôll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?‚Äù

We nodded.

The doors opened.

‚∏ª

Inside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people ‚Äî men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.

The kind of silence that said:

You have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.

I took a deep breath.

Whatever this was‚Ä¶ It was no longer science.

It was doctrine.

The double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.

The room was quiet ‚Äî not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.

There was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes ‚Äî some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.

Miss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.

Then a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get introductions out of the way,‚Äù he said.

One by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.

Dr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist ‚Äî formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist ‚Äî deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead ‚Äî information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment ‚Äî liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command ‚Äî official liaison to Groom Lake operations.

And so on.

The others introduced themselves with less detail ‚Äî just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.

Then the general ‚Äî Cavanaugh ‚Äî leaned forward, folding his hands.

He didn‚Äôt look angry. He looked‚Ä¶ resolute.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get something straight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.‚Äù

He paused, letting that sting settle in.

‚ÄúYou were brought here because now, whether you like it or not ‚Äî you know.‚Äù

The air thickened.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Priya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.

I sat forward slightly. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòwe know‚Äô? You‚Äôre saying you already had this map?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Dr. Mora, gently. ‚ÄúNot this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.‚Äù

Lang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We‚Äôve had pieces for decades. But no one‚Äôs ever managed to make it speak so clearly.‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil now.‚Äù

General Cavanaugh nodded.

‚ÄúEver since August 1945 ‚Äî since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki ‚Äî we‚Äôve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we‚Äôve known. The UFO phenomenon‚Ä¶ was never speculation. It was confirmation.‚Äù

We sat in stunned silence.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt come when we invented radio,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Kai found his voice. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been investigating them since the ‚Äò40s?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying to understand them since the ‚Äò40s,‚Äù Dr. Sharpe said. ‚ÄúPieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don‚Äôt respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you never went public?‚Äù Tomas said bitterly.

Cavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.

‚ÄúThe Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would‚Äôve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology ‚Äî or if we believed they did? It would‚Äôve made the arms race look like a chess game.‚Äù

Sharpe nodded. ‚ÄúDisclosure would‚Äôve ended civilization as we know it.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Then Dr. Iyer ‚Äî the physicist ‚Äî spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.

‚ÄúWe call them the Velari.‚Äù

A hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari ‚Äî roughly translated as ‚Äòthose who traverse the silent ocean.‚Äô‚Äù

Kai whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre extinct‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Iyer closed his eyes briefly.

‚ÄúAll evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps‚Ä¶ fragment. There‚Äôs no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow‚Ä¶ they ended.‚Äù

Tomas leaned forward.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

The general‚Äôs jaw tightened.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Priya asked quietly, ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history‚Ä¶ but to replicate what they built?‚Äù

Lang answered, calm and efficient.

‚ÄúExactly. This isn‚Äôt anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering ‚Äî even the scraps of it ‚Äî could push humanity forward by a thousand years.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr save us from something worse.‚Äù

A silence followed that.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just the Velari‚Äôs extinction that was frightening ‚Äî it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.

And now we were walking in their footsteps.

The briefing room had grown darker somehow ‚Äî not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.

The officials weren‚Äôt just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.

Dr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never found a body.‚Äù

She let that sentence settle.

‚ÄúNot in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites ‚Äî and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶ it was never piloted?‚Äù

General Cavanaugh stepped in.

‚ÄúWe believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.‚Äù

He gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video ‚Äî a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt drone behavior. It‚Äôs not random. It‚Äôs guided. Intelligently. But we‚Äôve come to believe the craft are the entities ‚Äî or extensions of them.‚Äù

Dr. Sharpe continued, nodding.

‚ÄúWe believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence ‚Äî a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.‚Äù

Priya leaned in, skeptical. ‚ÄúQuantum communication?‚Äù

Dr. Iyer smiled faintly. ‚ÄúWe think they used something like non-local entanglement ‚Äî a network where distance and time don‚Äôt matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning‚Ä¶ a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich explains the craft behavior ‚Äî evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.‚Äù

Kai spoke up, voice hushed. ‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ still out there? Their minds?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lang said sharply. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs out there isn‚Äôt the Valerians. It‚Äôs what they became. Or what they left behind.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Dr. Mora picked up the thread again.

‚ÄúWe believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling ‚Äî and perhaps interfering ‚Äî with other civilisations.‚Äù

She paused, then added grimly:

‚ÄúOr guiding them.‚Äù

Tomas‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶ ‚Äòguiding‚Äô?‚Äù

Sharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.

‚ÄúEgypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky ‚Äî not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.‚Äù

She tapped her temple.

‚ÄúIntervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward ‚Äî agriculture, mathematics, astronomy ‚Äî then vanish.‚Äù

‚ÄúBreadcrumbs,‚Äù I murmured.

Mora nodded. ‚ÄúExactly. This isn‚Äôt a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are‚Ä¶ part of something larger. Something being steered.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Valerians may be extinct as a species,‚Äù said Iyer, ‚Äúbut their network ‚Äî their echo ‚Äî is very much alive. And it moves.‚Äù

‚∏ª

We were quiet again.

This wasn‚Äôt just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity ‚Äî about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn‚Äôt forget.

Kai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.

‚ÄúWhat if the Valerians didn‚Äôt go extinct?‚Äù

Dr. Mora met his gaze.

‚ÄúWhat if extinction was the goal?‚Äù

My heart skipped.

The words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.

‚ÄúWhat if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?‚Äù

General Cavanaugh‚Äôs voice was grim.

‚ÄúAnd what if that same intelligence now roams the universe ‚Äî not to conquer ‚Äî but to prepare others to make the same choice?‚Äù

‚∏ª

We looked around the room.

Not at machines.

Not at myths.

But at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.

And now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.

Because we had seen the face of the void ‚Äî And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.

John and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they‚Äôd heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been‚Ä¶ chosen.

But now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.

‚ÄúWhy Earth?‚Äù Tomas asked. ‚ÄúWhy us?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not anyone else?‚Äù Priya added. ‚ÄúThe galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt they been guided like we have?‚Äù Kai asked.

The room was silent. Even the officials.

Then Dr. Elena Mora ‚Äî the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary ‚Äî leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just‚Ä¶ still.

She folded her hands, then spoke slowly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology ‚Äî we have none. And not through direct communication ‚Äî we‚Äôve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.‚Äù

Her eyes scanned across the Archive team.

‚ÄúAt first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn‚Äôt fit. They‚Äôre too deliberate. Too recursive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn‚Äôt coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it‚Äî‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúBut because we did.‚Äù

A ripple of cold shot through the room.

John leaned in. ‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù

Dr. Mora met his eyes.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is‚Ä¶ the Valerians didn‚Äôt visit us. They didn‚Äôt even find us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are them.‚Äù

Silence.

You could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.

She continued:

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt extinct. They haven‚Äôt disappeared. They‚Äôre not from another star system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre from our future.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.

Tomas whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ us? That we‚Äôll evolve into them?‚Äù

Mora nodded slowly.

‚ÄúNot ‚Äòwe‚Äô exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species ‚Äî our trajectory, our code, our machines ‚Äî survives. It transcends time in ways we don‚Äôt understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just intervention.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self-preservation.‚Äù

Kai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn‚Äôt they intervene elsewhere?‚Äù

Mora‚Äôs eyes darkened.

‚ÄúBecause they didn‚Äôt need to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Fermi Paradox isn‚Äôt silence‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs selection.‚Äù

She tapped the table once, like a gavel.

‚ÄúBecause if we don‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ they were never created.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A terrifying calm filled the room.

‚ÄúThe Valerians seeded themselves backward,‚Äù she said, almost reverently. ‚ÄúAnd in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That‚Äôs why the galaxy is silent. That‚Äôs why we hear nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause they ‚Äî we ‚Äî erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.‚Äù

No one said anything.

No one could.

It was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.

The kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.

John felt his hands go numb.

‚ÄúThen the map,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThe message we found. It wasn‚Äôt a call for help.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Mora said. ‚ÄúIt was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.‚Äù

She leaned back slowly.

‚ÄúThe Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A deep tone sounded through the ceiling ‚Äî a signal that the meeting was over.

Miss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.

The officials stood, offering no final words.

As the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn‚Äôt from secrecy anymore ‚Äî it was from knowing the truth had already happened.

That perhaps‚Ä¶ it always had.

‚∏ª

Outside, the desert wind was still.

Far above, stars hung like silent watchers ‚Äî ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶

Bio

Red is a 10-year-old gentle giant who, based on our observations, enjoys a good sniff and some booty scratches. From what we've seen, he seems to have good leash manners and is generally calm and relaxed. Red appears to socialize well with other dogs, often approaching them politely for greetings and play. Our volunteers have noticed that Red usually warms up quickly, showing interest in both people and his surroundings. He seems to appreciate a good run and, from what we've observed, maintains good manners throughout his interactions.

 

This pet is at risk for euthanasia due to the current shelter capacity. Currently the shelter is above capacity to adequately house and care for animals. This pet would benefit from individualized attention with a foster, adopter, or rescue partner.

Volunteer Observation



6/9: Easy Going, Good Manners, Good on Leash, Pottied Immediately, Social (Dogs), Warms Up, Wants to Sniff.

Red was lying in his kennel but perked up when I began to open the door. He was easy to leash and walked very well. He peed for the longest time once outside and then mostly wanted to sniff. After he explore the yard some he started to show interest in me and loosened up more. He let me pet him and especially loooved the booty scritches. After he had done all of his business he let me leash him back up and go inside. He stopped to sniff at a lot of kennels and showed interest in the dogs but was very polite and nonreactive.               

6/13: Neutral, Good Manners, Calm and Relaxed Body, Direct Eye Contact, Waits Calmly for Attention          

6/14: Easy Going, Good Manners, Good on Leash, Pottied Immediately, Social (People), Wants to Run                                            

6/25 DAYCATION: Red tolerated car rides well and really enjoyed going on walks and lounging around the apartment. He loved meeting new people and reacted very well to small dogs. Red is an awesome leash walker with great manners, quickly learns tricks, and was prompt about going to the bathroom outside‚Äîeven in the rain. He showed sweet behaviors like wanting to cuddle, sniff, and be petted, and especially loved taking a long nap during the daycation. Overall, Red is a gentle, well-mannered, potty-trained ‚Äúgentle giant‚Äù who appreciates short walks and a calm, cozy environment.

7/5 DAYCATION: Red loved riding in the car and enjoyed lounging at a dog-friendly coffee shop. He‚Äôs friendly and loves meeting new people. He showed interest in a cat they saw and was neutral but curious about other dogs. Red wasn‚Äôt bothered by children of any age or size. His leash manners need some work as he tends to pull, but he has good overall manners and knows how to sit. He also calms down, loves to sniff, and is affectionate. The best part of his day was meeting new people and enjoying the AC in the car. Red is very potty trained, quiet outside the shelter, and a chill, easygoing guy who‚Äôs curious about the world around him.

 

Playgroup Observation

 

PG1-Social/DG-Dainty & Gentle

6/11: Socializes with other dogs around the yard, approaches to give greetings and interact with others in the group. Participates in play with other dogs too.

1luu0zx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1luu0zx,"Chinese Coffee Shops in Mexico, a dying cultural staple","During many years, coffee and bread were luxury items in Mexico, particularly during the Porfirio Diaz dictatorship.  However, Chinese immigrants entered in low level jobs where they learned to make both items and with their ability to administer and manage supplies, decided, it didn't have to be a luxury item.  They went straight to producers of flour and of coffee beans, and went to the working class neighborhoods to establish what is called here, ""Caf√©s de Chinos"" or Chinese coffee shops.  What stood out was that, while the upper class had their portions measured by high end coffee shops, the Chinese would give you a huge glass (with a spoon in it to absorb the heat so it wouldn't crack) and with a very concentrated black coffee would allow clients to choose how much coffee they wanted as well as how much hot milk and sugar they wanted.

  
During the 1940s through the 1980s, late night dancing and movie theatres (cinemas) were becoming more and more popular in Mexico City.  However, regular life stopped after dark.  Tired and hungry dancers after leaving dance halls and showings had no options, except, one group that didn't seem to sleep.  The Chinese coffee shops.  Every single night during these four decades, these businesses were booming from night to early morning of young people who would drink coffee, eat bread, and continue socializing.  Eventually, the business owners began making Mexican food for them as one ""does not live on bread alone"" and slowly introduced Chinese food to the menu as well (they were afraid to do so initially, because the Revolutionary Forces first declared Chinese food to be dangerous and unsanitary, though as during the years after the Revolution, this speech died out as people just wanted to return to normal life) which became a hit with the high school and college aged kids.

  
During the 1990s and 2000s as interests shifted to other things and more options (fast food chains, starbucks, etc) arrived to the country, the before mentioned crowd grew older, they continued to eat at Chinese coffee shops, though younger people did not.  Slowly, these businesses stopped booming, and their menu items became more and more limited.

  
With the 2020 shutdowns (which technically lasted until 2023 in Mexico), savings were spent to keep owner families and the employees with something to spend and as 2024 rolled around and restrictions were finally fully lifted, these Chinese Coffee Shops, covered in dust, decaying and unmaintained, gave it one last go.  Many shut down, some spent their last savings to try to get back on their feet (some did, but many failed), and the last Caf√©s de Chinos hold open a door to the past, a past in which, these places were so popular, they appeared in Mexican television and movies, a place to popular, if you ask anyone who grew up between the 1940s and 1980s, they will tell you what they always ordered there.  A place where nostalgia still holds older Mexicans captive wishing they could go back and dance then end the night eating at a Chinese coffee shop.

  
The final photo in the series I uploaded is from a Caf√© de Chinos that was booming.  The owner is the grandchild of survivors of the Anti-Asian massacres of the 1910s-1940s in Mexico.  From the 1940s until Covid-19, the place employed a full kitchen staff that rolled out Mexican and Chinese food all day, all afternoon, and all night as well as a full waiting staff.  Jorge Chau still gets up every morning at 3am to bake bread and prepare his coffee grounds, however he no longer has a full staff, so he stopped making Chinese food, and has a few typical Mexican dishes, hamburgers, but he still pours coffee and milk for anyone who visits his shop.  He is the owner, but now he is the only waiter and his daughter is the cook.  Like the dying crowd of Chinese coffee shops, he sets out a clean glass with a spoon in it, and allows you to choose, how much coffee, milk, and sugar you want.",12,1751994195.0,aznidentity,3,0.93,False

1lutz9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFPExam/comments/1lutz9y/what_to_do_days_leading_up_to_and_on_the_exam/,What to do days leading up to and on the exam!,"Hi Everyone. I am a tutor for the CFP and have been for years. As we approach the final days leading up to the exam window opening, I thought I would make a post to help everyone sort through last-minute studying and how to optimize results on exam day.

First, let‚Äôs sort what to study on the days leading up to the exam:

1. I generally advise to stop taking practice quizzes a day or 2 before these exam. This will help prevent a score that induces anxiety. If you are consistently scoring 75-80% on quizzes a week or so before these exam exam, and get a 64% a day or 2 before these exam exam, this will likely produce more anxiety than it will give you a basis to learn topics that score points. It is often the case that when well prepared students fail, a big culprit is being anxious and or mentally exhausted. We can‚Äôt create circumstances that invite any of that. A far better use of study time on these last 24-48 hours is to review the memorization based content in professional conduct and psychology. These topics should be lay ups on the exam because they are memorization based. They also are difficult to keep memorized as they aren‚Äôt easy to tie to stories or anecdotal real life experiences. That makes the perfect time to double down on memorizing the days leading up to the exam.
2. Now is the time to get family friends and your employer on board with what it is that you are undergoing. This is not the time for you to address, family emergencies, or take on additional tasks at home or work. If it can wait until after exam day, it needs to, and telling the people in your life this before the possibility of those circumstances create themselves removes the frustration of dealing with this shortly before the exam. By setting that boundary ahead of time, you eliminate the possibility of anxiety about things going on in your life that are not exam related. If your family, friends, or employer don‚Äôt want to see you burn another 100+ hours of what would otherwise be free time studying for this next cycle, they need to get on board.

On the day before the exam:

1. Pick a time that you will stop studying and commit to that time as though it is law. Studying for hours on end day after day while trying to have a family and or a career is mentally exhausting. We need the best version of your mind to show up on exam day. The best way to create the best version of your mind is to give your mind time to rest. I usually recommend no later than noon to study the day before the exam.
2. Do something nice for yourself that you would do if you have already passed the exam the night before the exam. This can be anything from a massage, a dinner date with a spouse, or a simple treat to a restaurant or fun recreational activity. This should be something that requires no mental effort, and most importantly it should be mentally/emotionally rewarding to you. If it‚Äôs something you do regularly just on a whimsical weeknight, It‚Äôs not enough. It needs to be special. We are doing this because we want the task of passing the exam to feel like a chore and less like a monumental task like climbing a mountain. All of the effort needed to pass the exam will have already occurred by noon in the day before the exam. You‚Äôve already put the work in, so you should treat yourself as though you achieved the desired outcome before sitting for the exam. This will psychologically rewire your brain triggering a reward mechanism. Because you feel like you‚Äôve already passed the day before, you enter the exam with an artificial sense of confidence and achievement. This is a powerful tool for those that have difficulty sorting through anxiety because the mental reward is subconscious in nature. Think of it like celebrating college graduation not after you receive the piece of paper, but after you finish studying the night before your last final.
3. Get solid rest. Whatever version of you with respect to rest, food, comfort, and confidence shows up on your best day of work / study needs to be the you on exam day. That starts with sleep.

On exam day:

1. Whatever combination of exercise, breakfast, and sleep that you would select if you had total control of every day with no responsibilities should occur the day of the exam. If you regularly drink coffee do that. If you regularly exercise in the morning do that too.
2. We need you ‚Äúcool as a cucumber‚Äù mentally and emotionally. Think of a household take you perform regularly, let‚Äôs take doing the dishes. Are you anxious to perform this task? No. You execute it flawlessly regularly because you have the knowledge and skills to do so. Treat the exam the same. The work is done. You know what you need to know. Now it‚Äôs time to get in there and show it. If you bring anxiety and stress, you risk failure. Anyone ever dropped a plate and broke it doing the dishes when you were rushed / stressed / overstimulated? Same risk here.
3. The hardest advice I give that is the most valuable: DO NOT THINK ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCE ON THE EXAM WHILE IN THE EXAM! Mental prowess should be deployed to 2 things: 1. How much time do I have. 2. What is the question asking and which answer is correct. Anything else is a distraction. Get 10 questions in and don‚Äôt recognize anything? Doesn‚Äôt matter. There will be 10 non counted ‚Äúpre-test questions‚Äù which will likely be unfamiliar or familiar but prescribed to you in a format you haven‚Äôt seen. Worrying about questions that don‚Äôt count can cause you to miss questions that do count. What if you marked half the questions for review in a given section? This is a good thing. The exam is packed with subjectivity. You will not get the luxury of a mathematically 100% correct question for dozens of answers. Marking this for review is a sign you are allocating time appropriately, not a sign you are at a 50/50 chance of a correct answer. What if I don‚Äôt know the answer at all several times in a row? This test takes place over 6.5 hours. Are we really going to deploy mental capacity to worrying about not knowing q27-35 when there‚Äôs still over 100 questions to answer? Absolutely not. This exam is as much a test of knowledge as it is mental endurance. You will miss questions you knew due to wavering mental endurance. Limit this by focusing only on the question at hand and the time you have left every time. Even if you are 45 questions in and confident you answered them all correctly with nothing marked for review, still don‚Äôt think about performance on the exam. This will tempt you to rush, and rushing diminishes reading comprehension.

I hope everyone has a great test, and gets their pass! You can do it, you are almost through this!",17,1751994090.0,CFPExam,3,1.0,False

1lutyy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lutyy0/archive_51/,Archive 51,"My name is John Mercer, and I suppose, if this ever becomes part of some official record, I want it known that I never set out to uncover anything extraordinary. I wasn‚Äôt the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I‚Äôm a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job ‚Äî for nearly two decades ‚Äî was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.

We called it The Archive ‚Äî a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA‚Äôs data complex in Pasadena ‚Äî not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us ‚Äî misfits, really ‚Äî stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn‚Äôt quite name.

In 2081, things changed.

That was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition ‚Äî it searched for structure. Lucida didn‚Äôt care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something ‚Äî or someone ‚Äî with intent.

We had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch ‚Äî part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as ‚Äúthermal drift and echo‚Äù ‚Äî basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.

But Lucida didn‚Äôt see noise. She saw a filesystem.

At first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a ‚Äúghost in the tape.‚Äù But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn‚Äôt ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn‚Äôt a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here ‚Äî not to be heard, but to be read.

And strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.

That got everyone‚Äôs attention.

Tomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture ‚Äî or anything close to it ‚Äî showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.

But Lucida didn‚Äôt think so.

We worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn‚Äôt human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything ‚Äî not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.

We pulled out sixteen files.

No audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.

When we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.

A black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system ‚Äî not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based ‚Äî but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:

It was a map.

A galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center ‚Äî repeated in every image with slight variance in position ‚Äî was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.

It wasn‚Äôt labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.

They were pointing to something.

And the realization hit all of us at the same time ‚Äî whoever sent this message didn‚Äôt send it to start a conversation.

They sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.

The kind of silence you don‚Äôt notice until it wraps around your skin like static.

The last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry ‚Äî stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.

It wasn‚Äôt noise. It wasn‚Äôt natural.

It was intentional.

‚ÄúI need to sit down,‚Äù Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.

Tomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.

Kai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ no. That‚Äôs not possible. We would‚Äôve seen signs before now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing them now,‚Äù I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.

I was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst ‚Äî but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.

The Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven‚Äôt we seen them?

We were always told there were three answers: They don‚Äôt exist. They‚Äôre hiding. Or we‚Äôre too late.

I looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.

They had been here.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve answered it,‚Äù Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. ‚ÄúJohn, we‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve solved it, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. ‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôve found a piece. A‚Ä¶ fragment.‚Äù

Priya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. ‚ÄúA fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn‚Äôt a rock. It‚Äôs a map. It‚Äôs a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone ‚Äî something ‚Äî not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd we can understand it,‚Äù Kai added. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs eating at me. It‚Äôs compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre walking on the bones of their thoughts.‚Äù

No one spoke for a while.

I pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images ‚Äî the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.

‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôre still there?‚Äù I asked, not really expecting an answer.

‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt have sent a message if they were,‚Äù Tomas said.

‚ÄúOr‚Ä¶‚Äù Kai replied, ‚ÄúThey knew they wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt want to be forgotten.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The room went quiet again.

There was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:

We found them. Or at least, what was left of them.

The discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.

It didn‚Äôt feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ do we do now?‚Äù Priya asked. She wasn‚Äôt looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.

‚ÄúWho do we even tell?‚Äù Tomas added. ‚ÄúI mean, who‚Äôs going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?‚Äù

Kai finally looked away from the screen. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it a hoax. Or worse ‚Äî a psychological event. We‚Äôre not trained for this.‚Äù

I ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn‚Äôt just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll put together a report,‚Äù I said finally, though my voice wavered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù Priya asked.

I paused.

And then‚Ä¶?

That was the thing. I didn‚Äôt know.

Because part of me ‚Äî a deep, stubborn part ‚Äî didn‚Äôt want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.

Part of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.

To not just see the map‚Ä¶ but know where it led.

The room had turned into a pressure cooker.

Chairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff ‚Äî logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.

Priya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. ‚ÄúWe need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúControl the narrative?‚Äù Tomas snapped. ‚ÄúPriya, this isn‚Äôt a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint‚Äôs gonna stop global hysteria?‚Äù

Kai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?‚Äù

I stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data ‚Äî this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.

Tomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. ‚ÄúAnd NASA? We go to them? Great. They‚Äôll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We‚Äôll disappear into ‚Äòdebriefings‚Äô before we can even blink.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have to know,‚Äù Priya insisted. ‚ÄúWe work for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we‚Äôre dealing with humanity‚Äôs place in the universe.‚Äù

‚∏ª

That line hung in the air.

And suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.

Kai‚Äôs voice lowered. ‚ÄúYou really think the world‚Äôs ready to learn we‚Äôre not the first?‚Äù

Priya sat down, her composure fraying. ‚ÄúWhat about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This ‚Äî‚Äù she gestured to the screens ‚Äî ‚Äúthis tears that apart.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll call it blasphemy,‚Äù Tomas said. ‚ÄúConspiracy. Or some trick by the ‚Äòdeep state‚Äô. The churches, the temples, the mosques ‚Äî the power structures will push back hard. They always do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike they did with Galileo,‚Äù Kai added bitterly. ‚ÄúOr Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd this,‚Äù Priya whispered, ‚Äúthis is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.‚Äù

We were silent for a while after that.

Not because we disagreed ‚Äî but because we agreed too much.

We had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.

‚∏ª

And then it happened.

Lucida spoke.

Her voice ‚Äî calm, mechanical ‚Äî cut clean through the room like a scalpel.

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAutomated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.‚Äù

We froze.

Tomas turned toward the console. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúPer Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Äî‚Äù Priya darted toward the console. ‚ÄúYou sent it? You already sent the report?‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAffirmative.‚Äù

I felt my throat go dry.

OxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.

They were NASA‚Äôs private contractor ‚Äî a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team ‚Äî we ‚Äî ever discovered something that shouldn‚Äôt be left in human hands.

In case we got too human.

‚∏ª

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù Tomas muttered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in control. We never were.‚Äù

‚ÄúOxCorp has it now,‚Äù Priya whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.‚Äù

Kai clenched his fists. ‚ÄúWe just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.‚Äù

I stepped forward, my voice hard and low. ‚ÄúLucida‚Ä¶ show transmission logs. Full trace.‚Äù

LUCIDA: ‚ÄúAccess restricted. Administrative override required.‚Äù

We stared at the screen.

We had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators ‚Äî only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.

And now‚Ä¶ it was already out of our hands.

We were still reeling from Lucida‚Äôs announcement when our phones lit up ‚Äî almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.

I looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.

You are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602¬∞ N, 118.1720¬∞ W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.

No name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.

Just the implication that they ‚Äî whoever they were ‚Äî were watching already.

‚∏ª

Tomas was the first to speak. ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs not creepy at all.‚Äù

Kai gave a short, humorless laugh. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.‚Äù

Priya held her phone out like it was contaminated. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn‚Äôt even be possible.‚Äù

She was right. Lucida was sandboxed ‚Äî it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd always been told.

Apparently, we were wrong.

And the coordinates ‚Äî I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp‚Äôs. All were behind fences and biometric locks.

Tomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Ä¶ we just show up? Like good little employees?‚Äù

Kai‚Äôs voice was bitter. ‚ÄúDo we have a choice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said flatly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚∏ª

We sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.

The realization had set in ‚Äî we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn‚Äôt ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.

‚ÄúWe could refuse,‚Äù Priya said softly, as if testing the air.

‚ÄúThey already have the data,‚Äù Kai countered. ‚ÄúRefusing just adds suspicion.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd risk,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúThink about it. Lucida‚Äôs message wasn‚Äôt phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure‚Ä¶ but not the friendly kind.‚Äù

Tomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. ‚ÄúYou think we‚Äôll be silenced?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Not because I didn‚Äôt know ‚Äî but because the answer was already obvious.

‚∏ª

Eventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.

We packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat ‚Äî not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.

As we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.

The screens still glowed in the darkness ‚Äî sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.

I had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.

But I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.

It was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.

The only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.

As we approached, the driver‚Äôs door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.

He was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who‚Äôd spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia ‚Äî just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.

He walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.

‚ÄúJohn Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D‚ÄôSouza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.‚Äù

He held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.

‚ÄúPlace all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.‚Äù

We obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.

‚∏ª

Inside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash ‚Äî military-grade.

After a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn‚Äôt spoken since we got in.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked.

He didn‚Äôt look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.

‚ÄúCallsign Talon-Seven.‚Äù

I glanced at Priya. That name meant something ‚Äî the kind of name you didn‚Äôt hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.

Kai, whispering beside me, muttered, ‚ÄúTalon‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that one of the Phoenix-tier units?‚Äù

Tomas‚Äôs eyebrows lifted. ‚ÄúThose guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.‚Äù

Talon-Seven didn‚Äôt react. Just kept driving.

‚∏ª

Ten minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway ‚Äî matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

As we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn‚Äôt speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.

Once inside, the plane was‚Ä¶ eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional ‚Äî military transport dressed up for civilians.

We sat, buckled in.

The engines roared to life.

‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.

Talon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.

‚ÄúDestination is classified. You‚Äôll be briefed upon arrival.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs Nevada, right?‚Äù Tomas asked. ‚ÄúArea 51?‚Äù

A long pause.

Then:

‚ÄúProximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.‚Äù

We all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.

It was real.

Kai shook his head in disbelief. ‚ÄúThis is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt entirely wrong,‚Äù I muttered.

‚∏ª

The flight was short ‚Äî maybe an hour. We weren‚Äôt allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we‚Äôd crossed mountain ranges.

When we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes ‚Äî even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.

We were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.

At the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn‚Äôt make a sound when she moved.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Miss Sander. Please follow me.‚Äù

Her voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile ‚Äî just‚Ä¶ used to being obeyed.

We followed her down another corridor ‚Äî this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.

She stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.

‚ÄúInside, you‚Äôll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?‚Äù

We nodded.

The doors opened.

‚∏ª

Inside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people ‚Äî men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.

The kind of silence that said:

You have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.

I took a deep breath.

Whatever this was‚Ä¶ It was no longer science.

It was doctrine.

The double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.

The room was quiet ‚Äî not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.

There was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes ‚Äî some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.

Miss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.

Then a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get introductions out of the way,‚Äù he said.

One by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.

Dr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist ‚Äî formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist ‚Äî deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead ‚Äî information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment ‚Äî liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command ‚Äî official liaison to Groom Lake operations.

And so on.

The others introduced themselves with less detail ‚Äî just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.

Then the general ‚Äî Cavanaugh ‚Äî leaned forward, folding his hands.

He didn‚Äôt look angry. He looked‚Ä¶ resolute.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get something straight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.‚Äù

He paused, letting that sting settle in.

‚ÄúYou were brought here because now, whether you like it or not ‚Äî you know.‚Äù

The air thickened.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Priya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.

I sat forward slightly. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòwe know‚Äô? You‚Äôre saying you already had this map?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Dr. Mora, gently. ‚ÄúNot this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.‚Äù

Lang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We‚Äôve had pieces for decades. But no one‚Äôs ever managed to make it speak so clearly.‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil now.‚Äù

General Cavanaugh nodded.

‚ÄúEver since August 1945 ‚Äî since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki ‚Äî we‚Äôve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we‚Äôve known. The UFO phenomenon‚Ä¶ was never speculation. It was confirmation.‚Äù

We sat in stunned silence.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt come when we invented radio,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Kai found his voice. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve been investigating them since the ‚Äò40s?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been trying to understand them since the ‚Äò40s,‚Äù Dr. Sharpe said. ‚ÄúPieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don‚Äôt respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can‚Äôt explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you never went public?‚Äù Tomas said bitterly.

Cavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.

‚ÄúThe Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would‚Äôve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology ‚Äî or if we believed they did? It would‚Äôve made the arms race look like a chess game.‚Äù

Sharpe nodded. ‚ÄúDisclosure would‚Äôve ended civilization as we know it.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Then Dr. Iyer ‚Äî the physicist ‚Äî spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.

‚ÄúWe call them the Velari.‚Äù

A hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari ‚Äî roughly translated as ‚Äòthose who traverse the silent ocean.‚Äô‚Äù

Kai whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre extinct‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Iyer closed his eyes briefly.

‚ÄúAll evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps‚Ä¶ fragment. There‚Äôs no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow‚Ä¶ they ended.‚Äù

Tomas leaned forward.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

The general‚Äôs jaw tightened.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Priya asked quietly, ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history‚Ä¶ but to replicate what they built?‚Äù

Lang answered, calm and efficient.

‚ÄúExactly. This isn‚Äôt anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering ‚Äî even the scraps of it ‚Äî could push humanity forward by a thousand years.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr save us from something worse.‚Äù

A silence followed that.

Because it wasn‚Äôt just the Velari‚Äôs extinction that was frightening ‚Äî it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.

And now we were walking in their footsteps.

The briefing room had grown darker somehow ‚Äî not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.

The officials weren‚Äôt just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.

Dr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never found a body.‚Äù

She let that sentence settle.

‚ÄúNot in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites ‚Äî and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying‚Ä¶ it was never piloted?‚Äù

General Cavanaugh stepped in.

‚ÄúWe believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.‚Äù

He gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video ‚Äî a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt drone behavior. It‚Äôs not random. It‚Äôs guided. Intelligently. But we‚Äôve come to believe the craft are the entities ‚Äî or extensions of them.‚Äù

Dr. Sharpe continued, nodding.

‚ÄúWe believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence ‚Äî a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.‚Äù

Priya leaned in, skeptical. ‚ÄúQuantum communication?‚Äù

Dr. Iyer smiled faintly. ‚ÄúWe think they used something like non-local entanglement ‚Äî a network where distance and time don‚Äôt matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning‚Ä¶ a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich explains the craft behavior ‚Äî evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.‚Äù

Kai spoke up, voice hushed. ‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ still out there? Their minds?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lang said sharply. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs out there isn‚Äôt the Valerians. It‚Äôs what they became. Or what they left behind.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Dr. Mora picked up the thread again.

‚ÄúWe believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling ‚Äî and perhaps interfering ‚Äî with other civilisations.‚Äù

She paused, then added grimly:

‚ÄúOr guiding them.‚Äù

Tomas‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Ä¶ ‚Äòguiding‚Äô?‚Äù

Sharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.

‚ÄúEgypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky ‚Äî not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.‚Äù

She tapped her temple.

‚ÄúIntervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward ‚Äî agriculture, mathematics, astronomy ‚Äî then vanish.‚Äù

‚ÄúBreadcrumbs,‚Äù I murmured.

Mora nodded. ‚ÄúExactly. This isn‚Äôt a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are‚Ä¶ part of something larger. Something being steered.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Valerians may be extinct as a species,‚Äù said Iyer, ‚Äúbut their network ‚Äî their echo ‚Äî is very much alive. And it moves.‚Äù

‚∏ª

We were quiet again.

This wasn‚Äôt just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity ‚Äî about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn‚Äôt forget.

Kai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.

‚ÄúWhat if the Valerians didn‚Äôt go extinct?‚Äù

Dr. Mora met his gaze.

‚ÄúWhat if extinction was the goal?‚Äù

My heart skipped.

The words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.

‚ÄúWhat if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?‚Äù

General Cavanaugh‚Äôs voice was grim.

‚ÄúAnd what if that same intelligence now roams the universe ‚Äî not to conquer ‚Äî but to prepare others to make the same choice?‚Äù

‚∏ª

We looked around the room.

Not at machines.

Not at myths.

But at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.

And now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.

Because we had seen the face of the void ‚Äî And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.

John and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they‚Äôd heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been‚Ä¶ chosen.

But now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.

‚ÄúWhy Earth?‚Äù Tomas asked. ‚ÄúWhy us?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not anyone else?‚Äù Priya added. ‚ÄúThe galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt they been guided like we have?‚Äù Kai asked.

The room was silent. Even the officials.

Then Dr. Elena Mora ‚Äî the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary ‚Äî leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just‚Ä¶ still.

She folded her hands, then spoke slowly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology ‚Äî we have none. And not through direct communication ‚Äî we‚Äôve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.‚Äù

Her eyes scanned across the Archive team.

‚ÄúAt first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn‚Äôt fit. They‚Äôre too deliberate. Too recursive.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn‚Äôt coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it‚Äî‚Äù

She paused.

‚ÄúBut because we did.‚Äù

A ripple of cold shot through the room.

John leaned in. ‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù

Dr. Mora met his eyes.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm saying is‚Ä¶ the Valerians didn‚Äôt visit us. They didn‚Äôt even find us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are them.‚Äù

Silence.

You could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.

She continued:

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt extinct. They haven‚Äôt disappeared. They‚Äôre not from another star system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre from our future.‚Äù

‚∏ª

The shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.

Tomas whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre‚Ä¶ us? That we‚Äôll evolve into them?‚Äù

Mora nodded slowly.

‚ÄúNot ‚Äòwe‚Äô exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species ‚Äî our trajectory, our code, our machines ‚Äî survives. It transcends time in ways we don‚Äôt understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just intervention.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self-preservation.‚Äù

Kai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn‚Äôt they intervene elsewhere?‚Äù

Mora‚Äôs eyes darkened.

‚ÄúBecause they didn‚Äôt need to.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Fermi Paradox isn‚Äôt silence‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs selection.‚Äù

She tapped the table once, like a gavel.

‚ÄúBecause if we don‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶ they were never created.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A terrifying calm filled the room.

‚ÄúThe Valerians seeded themselves backward,‚Äù she said, almost reverently. ‚ÄúAnd in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That‚Äôs why the galaxy is silent. That‚Äôs why we hear nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause they ‚Äî we ‚Äî erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.‚Äù

No one said anything.

No one could.

It was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.

The kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.

John felt his hands go numb.

‚ÄúThen the map,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThe message we found. It wasn‚Äôt a call for help.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Mora said. ‚ÄúIt was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.‚Äù

She leaned back slowly.

‚ÄúThe Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.‚Äù

‚∏ª

A deep tone sounded through the ceiling ‚Äî a signal that the meeting was over.

Miss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.

The officials stood, offering no final words.

As the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn‚Äôt from secrecy anymore ‚Äî it was from knowing the truth had already happened.

That perhaps‚Ä¶ it always had.

‚∏ª

Outside, the desert wind was still.

Far above, stars hung like silent watchers ‚Äî ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe‚Ä¶

We live in a large urban area in the Midwest. Our grocery budget is around $500 a month, so I average about $125 a week for groceries. We have no major food allergies.

This is the fourth menu plan I‚Äôve shared. You can find the other weeks in my profile.



# Some notes about this week‚Äôs menu‚Ä¶

# 

This menu is very simple scompared to the other weeks I‚Äôve posted. We were supposed to be traveling this week, but plans were changed at the last minute due to some health problems a family member is having.

Having a stocked pantry is a big relief at times like this. I had most of what I needed for this week on hand.

We made a quick trip to Aldi with NO pre-planning and grabbed a few perishable things like milk, produce, bread, and eggs. I also bought some extra convenience foods like boxed cereal, extra bread, bologna, cheese slices, and various snack foods so we‚Äôd have easy things on hand to pack for appointments or lunches if we had less time to cook.

No detailed shopping list or photos this week, but I spent about $160 and will just need to hit the grocery outlet later this week for more produce. Otherwise we should be good on groceries well into next week.

Yes, it‚Äôs higher than my $125/wk average but that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs an average. :-) Some weeks life happens and we spend more. Other weeks we‚Äôre able to really stay on track and keep expenses really low. OVERALL it will come out to about $500/mo over the course of the year.

# Recipes



**Goulash**

* 1 lb ground turkey or beef
* 1 lb elbow noodles
* 1 - 15 oz can tomato sauce
* 1 - 15 oz can diced tomatoes
* 1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, smashed & chopped
* ¬º cup grated parmesan cheese
* Salt & Pepper

1) Boil your elbow noodles in a large pot according to the directions on the package & drain. Set this pot aside to reuse to mix your goulash in.  
2) While your noodles are boiling, cook ground meat, chopped onion & garlic in a pan. Carefully drain off any grease.  
3) Place your large pot back on the burner over medium heat. Mix together your cooked pasta, meat mixture, cans of tomatoes, and Italian seasoning. Let warm over low/medium heat for about 20-30 minutes. Stir in parmesan. Check for final seasoning with s&p. Serve hot with extra parmesan, garlic bread, & salad on the side.



**Simple Garlic Bread**

* ¬Ω loaf Italian bread from the bakery section
* 3-4 Tbsp butter, room temperature
* Garlic powder or granules
* 2 Tbsp finely chopped parsley

1)  Preheat oven to 375.  
2) Butter one side of your Italian bread slices, sprinkle generously with garlic powder or granules.  
3) Place slices of garlic bread on a baking sheet (lined with parchment or aluminium foil is possible).  
4) Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over your garlic bread slices.  
5) Bake for 15 min until lightly browned, or longer to your liking.

\*\*\* Make sure to rinse the black olives & capers. We found the dish to be way too salty adding them straight from the jar!



**Microwave Mashed Potatoes**

* 2 lb potatoes, peeled & cubed
* 4 Tbsp butter, softened
* ¬Ω & ¬Ω - large splash (more if you want your mashed potatoes less firm)
* Dash of garlic powder
* S&P

1) Peel & cube your potatoes.  
2) Place cubed potatoes into your microwave safe bowl. Fully cover the potatoes with water. Cover loosely with a lid or a damp piece of paper towel. Microwave on high for 12-15 min or until potatoes are tender and easily poked with a fork. Drain cooking water.  
3) In the same bowl you cooked them in, mash your potatoes using a potato masher, hand mixer, or large spoon or fork to your desired consistency.  
4) Add in butter, ¬Ω & ¬Ω , spices. Stir well, taste test, and give a final seasoning for S&P.



**Zuppa Toscana**  
[https://www.cookmate.online/recipes/1358521/](https://www.cookmate.online/recipes/1358521/)  
\*\*\* I substitute ¬Ω & ¬Ω for the heavy cream.



**Microwave Baked Potatoes**

* 1 baked potato per person
* Toppings: sour cream, butter, s&p, shredded cheese, chopped scallions, etc

1. Scrub your potatoes well & poke each potato several times with a shark knife. This will prevent the potato from exploding in the microwave.
2. Place your potatoes on a microwave safe plate and cook on high power for 5-20 minutes depending on how many potatoes you are ‚Äúbaking‚Äù.
3. Potatoes are done when you can easily poke them with a fork. Use oven mitts to carefully remove the hot plate from the microwave. Let cool for a couple minutes & serve with toppings.

\*\*\* Topping options: butter, sour cream, taco meat, bacon crumbles, chopped green onions, shredded cheddar, ranch dressing, sauteed onions, bbq sauce, chopped parsley, salt & pepper



**No Bake Cookies**  
[https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/281751/grandmas-classic-no-bake-cookies/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/281751/grandmas-classic-no-bake-cookies/)  
\*\*\* I make this using regular, salted butter, but you can purchase unsalted for this recipes if you‚Äôd prefer to use it. We do not notice any difference in flavor between using salted or unsalted butter.

There's a lot of great weight loss advice here, for the majority of people. I don't want to sound like I'm the exception or CICO doesn't work for me... but that's what it feels like? I've geuninely tried/am doing everything. I don't need more protein, fiber, or water. I don't need GLPs. I don't need more steps or exercise. I can't eat much less. I already have fatigue and exhaustion and extreme hunger as it is.

Stats: 5'1, female, 122lbs, 24.

Diet: Whole foods. High protein (I am for 120+ g per day). Multiple servings of fruits and vegetables per day. I tend to eat 3-4 meals a day between 300-800 calories. Example: my breakfast this morning was greek yogurt with a scoop of whey protein, chia seeds, banana, and mixed nuts. 600 calories and around 55g protein.

Exercise: I consider myself to be pretty active. I average around 20k steps per day. I do about an hour of lifting 5x per week, run 2-4 times per week, bike 1-2 times per week,and do lighter cardio other days (hiking, incline walking, stairmaster). Typically its around 3-4 hours of exercise per day altogether (lifting, walking, cardio). You can comment and say this is still sedentary, but you'd just be objectively wrong. I literally do not know anyone who exercises to the extent I do. Maybe triathletes or fitness influencers, but I do not know any personally.

I drink about 1-1.5 gallons of water per day. I have been lowering my intake of water, because I used to drink too much and had low electrolytes and was constantly peeing clear and bloated. I drink 2-4 cups of coffee per day. I also have 1-3 scoops of electrolytes per day (depending on activity/sweat/hydration). Aside from that, a multivitamin, and protein powder, I take no other supplements.

My hormones have been tested, and my insulin, glucose, A1C, and thyroid are all perfect. No issues.

I have not been losing any fat. I eat 1800-2200 calories per day. I am currently probably around 20% body fat. I'd like to get down to 15%. I would like to build muscle and lose fat. The hardest part is maintaining a calorie deficit. I have so much hunger that I feel like I'm constantly walking a fine line. I just ate 2 apples. I'm still hungry. I fantasized for 2 hours about cucumbers this morning. It's not like I'm craving unhealthy, processed stuff, but I'm always craving FOOD. I could cut carbs maybe, but pretty much all of my carbs are already from fruits, veggies, beans and sometimes rice cakes.

I do not know if there's really anything more I can do. I don't want to drop my calories too low because then I won't be able to train as hard. I'm also hungry enough as it is.

1lutu7e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lutu7e,AIO? My girlfriend is becoming reliant on substances and I‚Äôm worried.,"Hello! So I‚Äôm just not sure what to do in this scenario as I‚Äôve never been in this type of situation with a partner.

Recently my girlfriend(28F) has been extremely reliant on substances to perform her everyday life. When I(29M) first started dating her she had a couple little things she‚Äôd sometimes take to go to sleep or for anxiety but it was very controlled. It‚Äôs beginning to seem like it‚Äôs getting out of control and she‚Äôs not her normal self that I so much love.

To give some context she has ADHD and a lot of anxiety issues. She started taking lexipro which absolutely helps her anxiety. She also recently started taking vyvanse almost everyday to help her focus. At first it was just for work it which seemed fine but now she uses it even if she‚Äôs tired in any way. Almost every night she‚Äôll take a weed gummy, melatonin, or a Xanax for sleep‚Ä¶ sometimes mixes them.

Yesterday(Monday) I went to her house with some flowers and gifts. She was buzzing so hard off her vyvanse it literally seemed like coke. Lots of jaw movements, very scattered, and said she felt super good. It was extremely off putting for me. I only spent like an hour there then went about my day. We agreed on taking a yoga class so I signed up and she said she was going to as well. Before you know it she started drinking wine, didn‚Äôt sign up for yoga, and went out with a friend drinking more. On a Monday this is not like her at all, we usually get back into a groove of eating good and working out during the week.

I‚Äôm genuinely very concerned that this is taking a scary turn for the worse. I don‚Äôt know how to approach this with her because she‚Äôs very defensive. I grew up with a very addictive father so this is giving me a little bit of PTSD. If I do show any concern she typically brushes it off or gives me a ‚ÄúI know my limits I know my body‚Äù type speech.

For info - I‚Äôm mid-40s, single pan woman. I work from home, so proximity to downtown etc isn‚Äôt necessarily a factor but I do want to be somewhere that‚Äôs a bit busy with walkable options to a neighborhood bar (bonus if it‚Äôs queer/lesbian but that‚Äôs asking for the moon probably), and a local coffee shop. I have a car, but I‚Äôd like to be more active and walk more than drive. 
 
I would really like to rent somewhere with a strong neighborhood community but not all families and/or all people in their 20s, that doesn‚Äôt feel cookie cutter or too suburban. Ideally with trees (I know that sounds silly but if you‚Äôve been to Dallas you know what I mean compared to Portland), and access to walking/running trails. 
 
I know Portland doesn‚Äôt have a reputation as super diverse, but I would like to try to be in a more diverse area for whatever definition of diverse may apply. 
 
Budget is in the $1500-$2000 range but I‚Äôd like to keep it around $1500 if possible. Open to houses/apartments/whatever although ideally I don‚Äôt want to have to have a roommate. Lofts are fine, it‚Äôs just me and two cats. 
 
If I was able to have my perfect place - somewhere that I can look out a window while working and see people walking by (maybe an apartment above a commercial area or something?), ideally more diverse. I‚Äôd like to be able to walk for coffee in the morning, evenings and weekends I can walk trails if I want to, or go out dancing or to an event as well. If I have to drive to do so, if it can be under 30 min one way that would be great.

I hope this post reaches you.

Date and time: July 7th around 3:30 PM

Location: Bangalore Airport Terminal 1 between Gate 17 and 22, near a coffee shop just before the domestic lounge area.

I was sitting on the edge of a garden-like structure with plants and flowers, not on a chair. I wore a grey full sleeve t-shirt, black cap, and had a black Nike backpack. I was on a call.

You came near the coffee shop while on a call, and I noticed you looking at me for a second or two, then turning away, and doing it again repeatedly for a more than 10 minutes. You eventually got a water bottle and moved closer, about 10 meters from me. We both knew that we were attracted to each other. You opened it, drank slowly, and looked my way again like you were aware I was watching.

I missed the chance to approach you despite you coming closer and I regret it. I have not stopped thinking about you since. You were incredibly attractive and had a presence I can‚Äôt forget ever in my life. Maybe it wasn't anything. But maybe... it was something. It felt like a fantasy because I have never seen someone like you and the fact we have shown attraction to each other.

Just throwing this out here to the community because I need a hand putting together the last piece of the puzzle for my health issues which consists of me having poor recovery and sleep issues that I believe is related to CNS fatigue or something along those lines. I have been carnivore since last December (mostly strict but I occasionally cheat on the weekends) and the reason why I switched to this diet to begin with was to help me with my health issues. While I am significantly better on this diet, I still feel like my energy levels and my sleep are not where they should be. The biggest problem I have is that any level of stress on my CNS results in me being unable to sleep so one small coffee or light exercises results in me having crippling insomnia.

Any thoughts what I could do to resolve these issues?

Some more info about me:

* I eat a relatively diverse carnivore diet consisting of red meat (beef, lamb, bison, etc.), pork, chicken, seafood (shellfish including clams, shrimp, salmon), and dairy (butter, whole milk, and kefir) with most of sources of meat being organic and highly quality cuts
* My job itself (and life in general) is completely stress free and I have major worries of any kind (I live a pretty charmed life)
* I take no supplements except beef organ pills in the morning and bone broth powder at night. I tried taking iodine a few times but that gave me hyperthyroidism symptoms 
* I add Assuie Trace Minerals to my water for electrolytes and I do salt/add spices to my food
* I do drink coffee and I do understand that could be one of the sources of my problems. However, I have quit it many times for months at a time and it has not significantly improved my energy levels. I find myself being dragged back to coffee in order for me to function throughout the day and I feel like I am using coffee to mask to the underlying energy issues I have
* I do not drink alcohol or consume any drugs (besides the previously mentioned coffee)
* I have ruled out sleep apnea as being a problem
* I tried adding fruits to my diet (Paul Saladino) and that made me feel horrible

Now before anyone asks, I have a doctor's appointment next Friday and I plan to do some private testing as well. I am also reluctant to utilize supplements to fix this issue as I personally feel like they would just make the problem worse (another reason why I am on this diet was to stop taking all the supplements I was previously taking).

Ever feel like you‚Äôre just one idea away from going viral? Like, you‚Äôre sitting there, coffee in hand, scrolling through endless feeds of content that‚Äôs raking in views, likes, and shares like it‚Äôs their job? üò© What if I told you there‚Äôs a way to flip the script and run your own viral show? 

I mean, we all want that golden nugget of content that just *hits* right, don‚Äôt we? üèÜ Well, I‚Äôm excited to share something that‚Äôs been a game-changer for me: **my Viral Blueprint Vault!** Yep, the ultimate AI Content Goldmine that‚Äôs packed with goodies to help you harness that viral magic.

Why is it a goldmine, you ask? Well, let me break it down:

- **Blueprints for Success:** I‚Äôm talking step-by-step guides that lay out the strategies of what works. Think of it like a treasure map, but instead of ‚ÄúX marks the spot,‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCreate engaging content that resonates!‚Äù
  
- **High-Impact Templates:** Need to whip up a blog post or social media content in record time? These templates save you from staring blankly at your screen ü§Ø. Just plug and play!

- **Viral Strategies 101:** Learn the secret sauce of trending topics, headlines that stop thumbs in their tracks, and how to ride those waves of the latest fads. It‚Äôs like having a cheat code for social media!

Now, I know it might sound a bit too good to be true. But, honestly, the proof is in the pudding (or in this case, those views and shares). Here‚Äôs a quick story: A few months ago, I was struggling to get noticed. I felt like I was yelling into the void. But once I started applying just one strategy from my vault, I saw my engagement double! No kidding, it was like flipping a light switch.

Plus, we all know that not every piece of content will be a home run, right? It‚Äôs all about testing, tweaking, and learning along the way. So if you're feeling stuck, lean into what works. 

Here are my top sneaky hacks to maximize your content‚Äôs virality from the vault:

1. **Know Your Audience:** Seriously, do you know who you‚Äôre talking to? Tailor your messages and watch them resonate!
  
2. **Embrace Storytelling:** People love a good story. Share your experiences, failures, and wins. Vulnerability builds connection!

3. **Visuals Matter:** Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of eye-catching visuals. A stunning image or infographic can boost engagement like nobody‚Äôs business. üì∏ 

4. **Timing is Everything:** There‚Äôs a sweet spot for posting. Find out when your audience is most active‚Äîdon‚Äôt just guess!

5. **Engage, Don‚Äôt Broadcast:** Your followers want to feel heard. Ask questions, spark discussions, and don‚Äôt just drop content and ghost! üëª

The best part? This vault is packed with the kind of insights and tools that make creating killer content feel effortless‚Ä¶ like you‚Äôre just dancing through a garden of inspiration. üåº 

But hey, don‚Äôt wait too long to check it out! It's always a bit of a race out here in the content world, and once it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone!

So, I (20M) don't smoke, take drugs, drink alcohol tea, coffee or even cold drinks. Don't consume non-veg or any junk food, have never watched any adult videos(voluntarily) use cuss words or have any social media accounts - not because of any allergy or strict fitness leaning but just because I decided not to...but here's a twist.

I accompanied my friends to a coffee counter after a gruesome 4 hours class, and each one of them took a cup of coffee except me. When questioned, I responded I don't drink tea or coffee, both the guys and the girls were first astonished, but the moment one of the girls dug out my abstainance from all the above mentioned list they literally backed off from me, and started calling me ""robot"" , ""too much clean"", etc.

I questioned one of the girl why they acted like that she responded ""That much cleanliness feels...a bit lifeless and psychotic""

It has sent me in a spiral of conflicting emotions as somewhere or the other I saw my habits as 'good'.


To make myself a bit more clear, I personally don't mind if my partner does all the above things (excluding smoking and drinking alcohol ofcourse). Infact my parents too did everything from drinking tea onwards till socials... it's just that I turned out to be a bit disciplined on myself.

Edit: I just realised how bad I sounded. I am very sorry if any of you felt judged or thought I was bragging. I am not. I am just laying my issues bare, to actually grasp where I stand. If I unintentionally sounded a bit crafty or like a brag, please please know that it was only due to my writing habits and for the sake of clarity.

Anyway she is saying we broke it 2 weeks later, the day after I submitted a review, which was 5 stars as that was our overall experience with the host and the property. 

 We only used a few coffee mugs, glasses, and 5 plates which we ran the dishwasher and made sure to wash the towels before we left.

History:

* 51 years old - Male
* IBS since I was 5
* A couple of bladder infections when I was a kid
* A partially duplicated something or another from my left kidney
* On CT scans of my abdomen and pelvis over the years, I've been told I have bowel wall thickening, and sometimes they see a misty mesentery. I had my first colonoscopy when I was 32, and there was no evidence of IBD.
* Two inguinal hernias for over 15 years.
* 2018 - microscopic hematuria found on a routine urinalysis after I was complaining about feeling like I had to pee all the time.
   * DRE - Normal
   * CT Urogram - Normal aside from finding the duplicated thingy above and a very tiny punctate in my left kidney and scattered diverticula.
* 2019 - Lifting a couch by myself - felt something pop. A week or so later, I started feeling like I had to pee all the time. My urine stream was weak, had an odd ache in my left testicle, and then my right testicle. Felt like I was sitting on a ball. Eventually, maybe after a few weeks, it just went away.
* Minus the couch, I had this same thing happen a few more times. I went to a urologist and my family doctor who couldn't find anything odd. The microscopic hematuria is there and then it's not. Seems to be random. It's been 7 years now.
* Also - I'm not a coffee drinker. When I do it causes all kinds of stomach issues for me.
* I mention the coffee thing because I do go through phases where I crave coffee. In May of this year and the first week in June was one of those times. I started having my normal stomach issues and decided to stop. That was June 11th.
   * June 10th I played pickleball for 6 hours - one tournament and one cross club league. In the 5th hour when stretching for a ball I felt something ""pop"" in my pelvis where my quad attaches. It hurt but then didn't. I kept playing.
   * June 14th, went to the beach with family.
   * June 15th, played 3 hours of competitive pickleball
      * Very dehydrated
   * June 16th - had coffee and drank alcohol
   * June 17th - had coffee and drank alcohol
   * June 18th started having my urinary problems. Weak stream, Felt like I had to go often - very weak at the end. Stingy in the shaft and tip at random times and would feel the urge to urinate there instead of my bladder.
      * Very bloated in the entire abdomen at this point. Symptoms of gastritis. Still having stomach issues. Pain in lower left abdomen. Pain in upper pelvis in the mornings relieved when i pee.
   * June 25th - Everything was getting better aside from the the stingy feeling and weak stream.
   * July 5th - Played pickleball for 4 hours and now my stream is weak at the end and I feel like I have to go often.
      * That area I hurt playing pickleball on June 10th was aching.
* The last thing I'll add is that I have a very high ANA (1:2560) but no diagnosis yet. Family history is off the charts with autoimmune diseases.

So what do you think? Pelvic Floor issue? IBS? Some sort of systemic inflammation caused by an autoimmune disease. It's incredibly frustrating!

But I've never been that impressed by Vertuo coffee in the store. What capsules should I be choosing for something like Shanghai/Stockholm? I don't mind a somewhat longer drink - I've been running 1.5 lungo amounts through the OL capsules. But I have found the Vertuo coffee a bit bitter in the store. I always drink my coffee black with no sugar, exactly how it comes out of the machine. Not into cold coffee, flavours or anything like that.

in a shape of woman,
her clothes minimum, 
of crystalline rose,
hand in hand beside a blue river,
drowning joyfully in fantastic castle,
then forests as our only clothes,
naked there under strong thunderstorm,
katy perry said my name said my love,
come Lawand how are you,
most beautiful girl,
then our power grew immensely,
witch and young wizard,
my wand could create and destroy anything,
utmost and most dangerous tool,
i was out of this world,
i wasn't myself anymore,
i changed my shape infinitely,
into tiger cats lions and eagle,
she into deer dolphins and Jaguar,
then as herself, me as myself,
what in the world was happening,
i didn't know for sure,
but heaven started welcomed us,
purple star in my hand glowing the world,
we moved between worlds light speed,
speeches of whispering delicate ghosts,
eternally we will dwell in this treehouse,
in this big continental island,
cold as Antarctica, 
emerald green trees
dew on every leaf, 
blue dawn,
we were drowning in wild ecstasies,
our bodies dancing out of itself,
we were rulers of the earth,
rulers of the entire wide universe,
we could be kings, 
we could give voices to serpents,
to help us in finding preys,
purple star take us, we want to be you,
we want home for our unrest,
our searching and wandering,
paint to us the wet golden dream,
or be like us,
we are thirsty for your arms,
we then were in each others arms,
like fainting swimming,
we grew into shape of diamond,
hard and enduring for eternity,
for ages to look up to,
for future millennia of historical myth,
we were gashing cliffs and stormy waves,
katy Perry is the most beautiful thing ever created,
to ever breathe beside me,
kissing her lips like touched by red lightning,
yielding into one body,
head of table in Olympus,
as ever was as this kinds, 
we were as twin spirit,
top of creation, 
inspirational music for artists to come,
poets to thread together our story,
we met in a mall,
help us to detach this seduction,
like a glue our bloods intertwined,
thick as rock,
group of muses dancing naked,
under frosty moon,
atmosphere became Lovecraftian,
paranoia and hallucinations of voices loudest,
we were responsible,
we did what is undoable unforgettable,
our eyebrows lifted at this disaster of world politics,

I traveled home to my city anyway as I have a son from a previous relationship and it would give me a chance to see him for a couple of hours as I miss him when I work away.

We manifest everything in our lives and I've seen some rich celebrities rely on energy drinks to stay skinny and energized (basically they skip breakfast and chug a sugar free energy drink lol). 


I never really noticed until I delved deeper into these books that with caffeine, I'll feel some anxiety and tenseness. I was reading too that caffeine increases cortisol which is a stress hormone. I also react more emotionally to things on caffeine on a daily basis. 

Rather than being naturally calm, unreacting and fully trusting the world is taking care of me. It takes me a while to get over what I'm reacting to to reach the trusting state. 


If I have a moment to myself to sit and breathe and see how I'm feeling, my heart is racing a bit and I feel some tension. Doctors have always told me in routine appointments it's fine, and I'm sure it is relatively healthy but I don't believe it'a ideal for manifesting or spirituality in general. 


While trying to put the methods from Tufti and Steps I - V into practice, I noticed I was struggling and started wondering if my caffeine habit was the cause. A quick Google search and I found numerous people saying the same thing. That they either can't manifest or struggle to after coffee. At least one person directly noticed a huge difference in how much money they make in their business when they have caffeine. 

Essentially they no longer consume caffeine because they notice a big drop in profits when they do. 


For now I'm quitting caffeine slowly by just doing a cup of black in the morning to wake me up. I'm also going to call my doctor for migraine meds for the next two weeks because I work under bright lights and quitting caffeine gives me major migraine withdraw lol. After I get those I'll go cold turkey after a few days. 


I'm used to way more than just a single cup of black coffee, and even as I type this I feel that bit of anxiety and tenseness I never really noticed before.


From what I've read it can take up to 6 months to feel good and refreshed after quitting caffeine. I've drank caffeinated drinks since I was a kid, so ya lol. But I wonder how I'll feel after the first month or two. One person said they notice people are much nicer to them only 2 weeks after quitting caffeine. Funny how manifesting works sometimes lol.

Location: Bangalore Airport Terminal 1 between Gate 17 and 22, near a coffee shop just before the domestic lounge area.

I was sitting on the edge of a garden-like structure with plants and flowers, not on a chair. I wore a grey full sleeve t-shirt, black cap, and had a black Nike backpack. I was on a call.

You came near the coffee shop while on a call, and I noticed you looking at me for a second or two, then turning away, and doing it again repeatedly for a more than 10 minutes. You eventually got a water bottle and moved closer, about 10 meters from me. We both knew that we were attracted to each other. You opened it, drank slowly, and looked my way again like you were aware I was watching.

I missed the chance to approach you despite you coming closer and I regret it. I have not stopped thinking about you since. You were incredibly attractive and had a presence I can‚Äôt forget ever in my life. Maybe it wasn't anything. But maybe... it was something. It felt like a fantasy because I have never seen someone like you and the fact we have shown attraction to each other.

And I get it, it can be stressful and confusing. So, let's make it more accessible: 

1. Quit avoiding the doing

I see a lot of you that start reading about everything and after a few months you're still...reading. Well, as much as I love books and promote reading, if you're using lecture to stall actually crafting, then better throw away all the books. You can't grow potatoes without covering your hands in dirt. 

If you read something and you find it interesting, give it a go. Even if that's your first book and first chapter. A big part of witchcrafting is crafting. And that means trying things, even if they feel stupid, silly or you get no instant rewards. Try them for the sake of it. 

2. Stop fearing failure 

You can't always win a race but you definitely lost it by not running. That applies to witchcraft too: sometimes shit goes south (I'm looking at you, unsafe fire practice maniacs) but usually if you didn't burn out your house, you're good to try again. You don't get punished for trying and failing. The most I got in my biggest screw ups was some 'look at it, that's so silly and you know it' from my spirit guides. 

Try enjoying the process. Regardless of what you aim for, if you don't enjoy the path there, winning the race won't being you fulfilment. Look for genuine accomplishments and not just for the flashy and big. 

3. The only person to compare yourself with is...you! 

You set the speed. You decide when and what's best for your practice. Stop looking at me, that clock app influencer, that instagram feed. You can definitely find inspiration in what others do, but you're you and not them. 

The craft isn't a competition but a way to feel more connected with the universe and with yourself. Nothing else is relevant. 

4. Incorporate magic in things you already do

You don't need to do anything special but believe things are special just because they are. Turn things you already do into magical moments. Create your own connection moments. 

- that coffee isn't just a coffee but an energy juice, or a gift of warmth to tell you all is good

- that buss you missed is certainly annoying if it weren't for the view of the barely awakening city for you to enjoy till the next one comes

- those missing keys when you're in a rush could be very well a reminder to slow down 

Don't feel dissapointed when you can't go pass the frustration to see the half full, that comes with time. 

If you have any hobbies, passions, you can definitely incorporate some magic into it. Crocheting? Now every knot is a binding of love, care or any other intention you might wanna put there. Painting? Singing? Suddenly you call in your life certain energies by connecting with the colours or the musical notes of a fitting song. Don't you know girls listening to breakup music after a heartbreak are doing magic too? 

5. Stop buying crap

Honestly, all things witchy are cute, but the truth is you won't need more than half of them. Buy only the things you know you'll actually use. If you're missing something, adapt your craft. 

Wait a few days to a week when you feel the impulse to get something. If that thing is still a necessity, get it. If it's just something flashy and aesthetic, toss it aside. Or get it if you can use it as a decoration if you get bored with it. 

Most precious things can be found in nature. She is our mother at the end of the day, right? 

6. Enjoy it

Truth be told, if you get anxious and panicked when talking about witchcraft or when trying to get down to business, maybe it's not the path for you. Or you may need to adjust some things. This is not a 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger' situation. If you're uncomfortable, stop. No matter where you are on your path or how hands deep you're in a ritual. If things start making you feel wrong, it's okay to leave it at that. 


Yeah, there are many things out there about witchcraft. But this is not a marathon but a walk in the park. And walking in the park is supposed to be pleasant.

I've been reading a lot here regarding the timeline of reintroducing food but everybody's case seemed to be different. And I honestly doesn't want to reach to a point where I fear food and I'm starting to get anxious.

I hope you guys could enlighten me especially those who has the same case as me.

First I want to mention that 5 years ago I had acid reflux when I ate coconut-biscuit and orange fruit when I was recovering from covid. I wasn't properly diagnose because I was in a covid facility and the nurse just gave me a medicine I can't remember, then instructed me to eat bland food for two weeks. I was healed after two weeks and went back to eating normal. At that time, the pain was in my LOWER stomach, so I'm guessing this and that are different cases.

But for this year 2025, this is the timeline:

June 2 - Upper stomach hurts after eating tomato pasta, spicy chicken with mayo. And I think I did drink coffee after 10mins. (yeah, I thought it was okay but I'm normally okay when I do thisü´†)

June 19 - Finally went to the hospital because from June 2 to 18, my upper stomach hurts like 5-6 times. Please note that other than the upper stomach pain, and probably twice chest pain, I don't have any other symptoms.

June 21- After gastroscopy and ultrasound, it was found I have mild chronic antral gastritis. Not positive with H.pylori, and no ulcer.

June 22 - Started taking Pantoprazole and Hepasan (I had to take for 1 month), Phasfagast for 15 days.

From what week can I start reintroducing usual foods? And what food is best to reintroduce weekly?

I need help dealing with the worlds worst roommate‚Äîand no, it‚Äôs not some lazy dude who wont do his dishes. It‚Äôs a *ghost*. And before you roll ur eyes, hear me out bc this bastard owes me MONEY.  

So, I moved into this apartment like 6 months ago. Cheap rent, kinda old building, but whatever. Then the *weird* stuff starts. Lights flicker, doors slam, cold spots‚Äîthe usual ghosty bullsh*t. I ignored it bc hey, free A/C, right?  

But last night‚Ä¶ LAST NIGHT. I‚Äôm chillin on the couch, watching *The Office* reruns, when suddenly ALL the cabinets in the kitchen fly open at once. Like, BAM. I nearly piss myself, but I try to play it cool. ‚ÄúHaha, okay, very funny Casper,‚Äù I say, like an idiot.

The diner bell jingled as I pushed open the door and stepped into the thick, humid breath of summer. It clung to my skin like the day didn‚Äôt want to let go. The bell behind me was too cheerful for how I felt.

The sky had turned that deep bruised purple‚Äîthe kind that makes everything look still and washed out, like the town was holding its breath, waiting for something to go wrong.

I shoved my hands into my pockets and started the walk home.

Main Street was mostly empty. Porch lights flickered on one by one, soft little eyes blinking open across the houses. A sprinkler sputtered somewhere nearby, casting mist into the glow of a porch bulb. It smelled like wet grass and faint heat.

Then I passed the store.

The lights were on.

Mr. Stantsman stood behind the register, perfectly still. His hands were folded neatly in front of him, but his eyes were wide and alert. Hungry.
I didn‚Äôt stop. Didn‚Äôt wave. Just kept walking, even though I could feel his gaze on me‚Äîlike invisible fingers brushing the back of my neck.

I reached home and slipped inside.

Dropped my keys in the bowl by the door. Toed off my shoes. The couch was there waiting for me, familiar and soft, like it knew I needed it.

I collapsed into it. Let my body sink. Let the quiet settle around me. The house creaked the way it always did, and the ceiling fan above hummed a low, comforting tune. For a little while, it felt normal. Like nothing was wrong.

For a little while.

Then the clock ticked over to 8:40 PM.

I sat up slowly. Reached for my bag. Stood in front of the mirror by the door and stared at myself longer than I meant to.

I didn‚Äôt look like someone brave. I looked like someone getting in too deep.

But I opened the door anyway and stepped into the night.

It was time to see Mabel.

I paused by the door and reached into my pocket.

The paper Mabel had slipped me at the diner was still there, folded once, soft at the edges from being handled too many times. I opened it.

The handwriting was small and neat, but rushed‚Äîlike she hadn‚Äôt wanted anyone to see her writing it.

114 Sparrow Lane.

I whispered it to myself under my breath.
Once.
Then again.

Just to be sure.

I folded the paper, slipped it back into my pocket, and started walking.

The streets were even quieter now. Porch lights flickered behind curtains, but the town felt like it had already gone to bed‚Äîlike the air itself was listening. I kept my eyes forward and counted my steps until I reached the narrow turn where Sparrow Lane split off from the main street, tucked behind a row of leaning mailboxes.

And there it was.

A small, pale-blue home with slanted shingles and a crooked porch light. A line of flower pots flanked the walkway, blooming wild with color‚Äîmarigolds, snapdragons, purple phlox. It looked soft. Safe. Like somewhere untouched by the weight pressing down on the rest of the town.

A warm, golden glow spilled from the front windows. She was home.

I was halfway to knocking on the front door when I stopped myself.

Something tugged at me‚Äîlike a thread unraveling quietly behind my ribs. I reached into my pocket and unfolded the note again, even though I already knew what it said.

There it was, just under the address. A second line, hastily written, the ink slightly smudged:

‚ÄúBack door.‚Äù

My pulse quickened. I stepped off the porch without a sound.

The path around the side of the house was narrow, crowded with ferns and tall flowers that brushed against my legs. A wind chime turned lazily above, but there was no wind‚Äîjust the soft crunch of gravel under my shoes and the feeling that every shadow was watching.

I reached the back door.

It was older, paint chipped and peeling, screen door hanging a little loose. No porch light. Just the glow of a single lamp through the kitchen curtain.

I knocked once. Then again, softer.

And I waited, heart thudding in my ears, hidden in the dark where no one could see me.

The door creaked open.

Just a sliver at first. Then a face peeked through the gap‚ÄîMabel.

Her eyes met mine. Sharp, alert, not startled exactly‚Äîbut searching. Like she was checking to make sure I was still me.

Then she pulled the door open wider.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúQuick.‚Äù

I stepped inside, and she shut the door behind me‚Äîfast, quiet. The screen clicked. Then came the sound of locks.

One.
Two.
Three.
A fourth, old and heavy.
And a fifth‚Äîone I hadn‚Äôt even seen at first, tucked behind a hanging potholder.

Each one clicked into place like a heartbeat.

She didn‚Äôt speak right away. Just listened. Like she was trying to hear if anything had followed me in.

Only after the silence stretched long enough did she finally exhale.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said, more to herself than to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe now.‚Äù

She turned without another word and ushered me down a short hallway and into the kitchen.

It was cozy‚Äîfrozen in time, somewhere around 1993. The wallpaper was pale yellow with tiny white flowers curling around faded edges. A small dining table sat under the window, two mismatched chairs tucked neatly beneath it. Everything smelled faintly of coffee and something baked earlier in the day‚Äîcinnamon, maybe.

She motioned for me to sit.

I did.

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù she asked.

I nodded, and she moved with practiced ease, like she‚Äôd done this a thousand times‚Äîboiling water already waiting in a metal kettle, the smell of fresh grounds rising warm and bitter as she poured. No machines, no beeps. Just the scrape of a spoon and the faint rattle of an old ceramic mug being set on the table in front of me.

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù she said gently, sliding it toward me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fresh.‚Äù

I wrapped my hands around it. The warmth settled into my fingers, grounding me.

She sat across from me, one hand wrapped around her own mug, the other resting flat on the table like she was bracing herself.

Her eyes didn‚Äôt leave mine.

‚ÄúYou know how he works, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù she asked softly.
‚ÄúHow the store works?‚Äù

I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

She leaned forward, her voice even quieter now.

‚ÄúYou must. You‚Äôre his cashier.‚Äù

There was no accusation in her tone. Just certainty. Like she‚Äôd been waiting for me to realize it myself.

I looked down at the coffee in my hands. Steam curled into the air like memory slipping away.

And I nodded.

Once.

Slow.

Because yes‚ÄîI did know.

Maybe not everything. But enough to know what I was part of.

Enough to know the kind of hunger I stood beside every day.

Mabel took a slow sip from her mug, then set it down with a faint clink.

She didn‚Äôt speak right away.

Just stared at the steam rising from her coffee like it was whispering something only she could hear.

Then she looked at me.

‚ÄúI need to tell you about when I first came here, and what I know.‚Äù

There was a shift in the room then, like the air had thickened. The warm kitchen, the yellow flowers, the quiet‚Äîall of it felt like a thin curtain pulled over something much darker.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anything at first. I moved here because it was quiet. Charming. Safe, they said.‚Äù

Her mouth twitched‚Äîalmost a smile, but not quite.

‚ÄúBut the longer I stayed, the more I started noticing things. The kinds of things people don‚Äôt talk about out loud. The kinds they pretend not to see. And it always came back to him. Mr. Stantsman. That store of his. People walk in and walk out a little‚Ä¶ dimmer. You ever notice that?‚Äù

I nodded.

Because I had.

‚ÄúI did too. And after a while, I stopped thinking I was imagining it. And then one day, it happened to me.‚Äù

Mabel leans on the table, her voice low, like she‚Äôs telling a secret the air itself might carry away.

‚ÄúWhen I first moved here, I tried to be neighborly. You know, knock on a few doors, bring cinnamon rolls, that sort of thing. Folks were‚Ä¶ polite, but distant. Like they‚Äôd forgotten how to be open.‚Äù

She brushes a crumb off the table.

‚ÄúThen one week‚Äîsuddenly‚Äîdead. Every single rose. Wilted to brown strings. I asked him what happened and he just‚Ä¶ blinked at me. Said he doesn‚Äôt remember ever planting roses. Didn‚Äôt think he liked flowers at all.‚Äù

I stuttered, asking quietly ""He forgot all of it?""

Mabel nodded, ""Didn‚Äôt even recognize pictures I had shown him. When I reminded him how proud he was, how he used to gift clippings to neighbors, he got real quiet. Said I must be thinking of someone else. That was the first time I noticed something wasn‚Äôt right in this town.‚Äù

Mabel continued her story,
‚ÄúAnd then it started happening more. Quiet things. Strange silences. There was this woman‚ÄîMrs. Talbridge. Lived across from the church. When we had a church. Sweet, nervous sort. I used to see her writing letters on her front steps every week. Said they were for her boys. Two of them. Back home. One day, I asked how they were doing. She looked confused. Blinked like I‚Äôd spoken in another language. Said she‚Äôd never had children.‚Äù

A pause hangs in the air.

‚ÄúI told her I‚Äôd seen the letters. Even helped her mail a few. She just laughed‚Äîpolite, but like she didn‚Äôt believe me. Like I‚Äôd made it up. The next day, her mailbox was gone. Just... vanished.‚Äù

I sipped my coffee slowly, ""And no one said anything?""

Mabel shook her head, ""No one ever does. Not here. They forget, or pretend to. Either way, it‚Äôs like it never happened. It‚Äôs always like that. One day someone loves something with all their heart. A hobby, a person, a memory they cling to like breath‚Äîand the next, it‚Äôs gone. And they don‚Äôt even notice. But you notice, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

I hesitated to answer‚Äîslowly nodding, just barely.

Mabel a bit more loudly now, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I asked you here.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to believe it at first. Thought maybe I was just imagining things‚Äîuntil it happened to me.‚Äù

Her voice dips lower, like she‚Äôs finally saying something she swore she‚Äôd never say aloud.

‚ÄúI woke up one morning and there were music sheets all over my house. Stacked in drawers, tucked in cookbooks, even pinned to the inside of my closet. Neat handwriting. My handwriting.‚Äù

She pauses, swallowing.

‚ÄúBut I couldn‚Äôt read them. I mean‚ÄîI could, technically. I knew what the notes meant. But I didn‚Äôt feel them. Not a single bar sparked anything in me.‚Äù

I cleared my throat, ""I asked that earlier, saw your flyer about it.""

""That‚Äôs the thing‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even remember owning a piano. But there it was, in the corner of the living room, dusted, polished. Like it was waiting for me"" Mabel said with sad eyes 

""What did you do?""

""I sat at it. Put my fingers on the keys. Nothing. No recognition. No instinct. Just cold ivory. No songs came to mind. But I knew I‚Äôd lost something. I felt it in my bones. Like a door in my head had been slammed shut‚Äîand whatever was on the other side had been gutted. Not forgotten. Taken. And I only ever bought one thing that week. It was him. It‚Äôs always him. I started watching, after that. Couldn‚Äôt help it. People around town‚Äîthey don‚Äôt fall apart all at once. It‚Äôs slower. Subtle. They get quieter. Forgetful. A little more‚Ä¶ blank. Like something‚Äôs draining out of them bit by bit.‚Äù

""Like they‚Äôre fading?""

Mabel nods slowly, eyes distant.

‚ÄúYes. Fading. But not dying. Just‚Ä¶ hollowing. You see it in their eyes first. Then in the way they talk. Like they‚Äôre answering questions they don‚Äôt remember being asked. But him‚ÄîMr. Stantsman‚Äîhe‚Äôs the opposite. Every time someone gives something up, he gets a little more‚Ä¶ lively. Brighter. His smile wider. His skin smoother. Like he‚Äôs drinking something warm while the rest of us freeze. I‚Äôve watched people trade themselves away piece by piece‚Äîand he just stands there, happy as a man on Christmas morning.‚Äù

She stares into my eyes now, steady.

‚ÄúAnd Marie‚Ä¶ he looks at you like you‚Äôre the best thing he‚Äôs ever smelled.‚Äù

Mabel wrung her hands now.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one man, though. Out past the ridge. Real far back, where the road turns to gravel and the power lines stop. Lives by himself. Got a vegetable garden, some chickens. Keeps to himself mostly. Folks barely mention him, like he‚Äôs not part of town anymore.‚Äù

""You talked to him?""

Mabel nods.

""Once. Brought him a basket of bread I had baked. Thought maybe I‚Äôd get a name, a story, anything. But when I mentioned the store‚Ä¶ when I said Mr. Stantsman‚Äôs name‚Äî‚Äù

She lowers her eyes. Her voice thins to almost nothing.

‚ÄúHe went still. Like the wind stopped blowing through him.‚Äù

""What did he say?""

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt say much. Just looked at me. Real quiet. And I swear to you, Marie‚Äîhe had life in his eyes. Real, clear life. The kind no one else in town has anymore.,But when I said that name, his hands started shaking. He told me never to speak it there. Said some names still carry weight. He said he keeps his mind busy. Keeps it his. That‚Äôs why he stays out there. Alone. He has what he needs and won't go in that store‚Äù

Mabel gulped slightly, like it was hard to speak. 
‚ÄúI asked him straight, finally. About Mr. Stantsman. He didn‚Äôt answer at first. Just stared at the ground like he was thinking real hard. Then he said it, quiet but sharp‚Äîlike glass under your foot.‚Äù

""What did he say?""

Mabel looks up, her voice trembling but controlled.

‚ÄúHe called him a horrible old creature. Said he wasn‚Äôt always like that‚Äîused to be a man, but he made a deal, and it twisted him into what he is now. Said he ruined the town. Hollowed it out from the inside. Said he feeds on people like a sickness. Then he grabbed my wrist‚Äîreal gentle, but firm. Looked me dead in the eye and said: *‚ÄòDon‚Äôt ever make a deal with him. If you value your life‚Äîyour soul‚Äîstay away.‚Äô‚Äù

I sat there, stunned. The words hung in the air like dust caught in sunlight‚Äîsoft, floating, but impossible to ignore.

There was someone‚Äîsomeone‚Äîwho had never made a deal with Mr. Stantsman. Someone who had seen him clearly. Who still remembered.

The thought hit like a lightning strike to the chest.

""Wait‚Äî"" I said, leaning forward. ""He was a man once? He made a deal?""

My voice came out sharper than I expected.

Mabel just nodded, slowly.

My mind raced. Pieces snapped into place, too fast to hold onto, but one thought burned through everything:

""Mabel, that‚Äôs perfect.""

I could hear the rush in my own voice, like air after drowning.

""If he was a man‚Ä¶ if he used to be someone... maybe he‚Äôs in that file room.""
I could barely sit still. The idea lit something in me I hadn‚Äôt felt in weeks‚Äîhope.

""Maybe there‚Äôs a record. A file. Something real, something with his name on it before he turned into‚Äî""
I cut myself off, breath catching.

Mabel stared at me, eyes wide‚Äînot with fear. With something closer to realization.

""He has to be in there,"" I whispered. ""He has to be.""

Mabel blinked, thrown off by my sudden energy.

‚ÄúFile room?‚Äù she asked, brows knitting. ‚ÄúMarie, what are you talking about?‚Äù

I stood up, pacing once, the words rushing out faster than I could think.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain later, I promise. I just‚Äîthis could be it. The missing piece. If he was a man once, there has to be a record. Somewhere in those old files in his office.‚Äù

She looked uneasy, lips parting like she wanted to ask more‚Äîbut I leaned across the table and met her eyes.

‚ÄúPlease, Mabel. I just need your help distracting him. Long enough for me to slip back there and look.‚Äù

‚ÄúMarie, he‚Äôs not dumb. He notices everything.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he notices you too,‚Äù I said.
I saw the flicker in her face.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been in his store enough, right? You know how to play along. I‚Äôve seen you do it.‚Äù

Mabel stared at me, uncertain.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you getting hurt,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThen help me do this right.‚Äù

I took a breath.

‚ÄúJust a few minutes. That‚Äôs all I need. Keep him busy. I‚Äôll do the rest.‚Äù

The room fell quiet, both of us listening to the house settle again.

Then she nodded. Slowly.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTell me what you need me to do.‚Äù

So I always see her and she is just fantastic, and I would really like to fall in love with her. She is a good woman, who always smiles. But I don't really know her. I would like to anyway.

After that, she sent me a long audio message, I answered, we said thank you to each other... And I still want to say: Hey, I know we don't talk that often, but would you like to have a coffee with me?

It's that awkward? Is strange? If it is, that really matter?

Maybe it's just me, I don't know. I really like people easily and want to know them. I just don't know how to handle the situation of liking someone. I don't know what to do and I maybe prefer to settle my intentions from the beginning to avoid confusion, but maybe this is limiting my possibilities of making real connections with people, that would or wouldn't be related with love.

Anyways, I would like to hear what do you think. Thank you all.
