1gxbd29,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstacartShoppers/comments/1gxbd29/less_ic_more_doordash/,Less IC more Doordash,"I have been doing IC for three years and for the most part I loved it.  I say this in past tense.   I have had a lot of great experiences, and I have some customers who are my friends now.  I have been to great places, like the Olympic training center in Chula Vista, a big cat sanctuary, but IC has really slowed down for me.  

It's really frustrating, because I have a dearth of batches, but I go to Walmart and I see people with batches.  They are BAD shoppers.  I know this because I use IC as a customer.  These people don't care.  They get perishables and frozen items first.  Common sense tells you to get them last, but they don't have any.  The result is that a lot of my customers have stopped using IC, because of universally horrible service.  These guys don't speak English, they don't read their messages, and they cancel, without asking about replacements.  I specifically send a message for them to shop my ice cream last, and they don't realize that I keep track of their shopping and every single time, they get my ice cream first.  A guy with 4,000 orders got my ice cream bars first.  These are the same people who complain about low tips.  I had one customer tell me I tip better for good service, and then tell me in the comments, it was the first time in two years she had raised the tips.  

 I care about my customers.  I had a coffee shop order cinnamon sticks, and the store didn't have them, but there was another version of the same store on the way to his place, and I told him I could stop and get some there.  He declined, but I got a bigger tip.  

I have been doing more shopping orders from Doordash, and it's a mixed bag.  I almost always get a single order, but DD has also had me going to three different stores, but I know why, they are all on the way to the next customer, it's a pain, but I understand.  IC has been dead, and I think a lot of former IC customers are using Doordash.  

I see a lot of the same bad shoppers doing Doordash, but I don't think these guys take shop orders.  

I know I will miss doing IC.  I will miss my regulars, Not, to brag, but it's IC's loss.  ",1,1732291796.0,InstacartShoppers,0,1.0,False

Looking for a coffee maker. I know everyone here recommends Moccamaster, but we have a bit of a unique requirement. My wife likes her coffee hot, and I like mine cold. To date, we've used a Cuisinart DCC-3200, which had a programmable warmer time. I turned it down to 5 minutes, my wife would get her coffee immediately after brewing, and I'd get mine 40 minutes later and pour it over ice, it worked great until it broke less than a year outside of warranty.

With the Moccamaster, it looks like the warm must be on to brew. Ideally, we're looking for a coffee maker that can brew with the warmer off and/or that can be programmed to turn it off quickly after brewing. My wife is fine with grabbing hers right away so that it's hot, leaving the cooling process to get started as quickly as possible for me. Any suggestions you all have are appreciated!

I am F25, and I met a friend, M34, this September. We initially met playing Pickleball and played with some friends from a tennis group or just his different friends for about a month and a half until it got cold outside.

The night before, at around 2am, he messaged me to cancel in a series of replies and never rescheduled another time to go. Furthermore, on social media, he would like my Instagram stories of pictures of myself or memes I post, but never anything I post on my feed‚Äîjust an observation. He would remember details about me such as my favourite foods, city, pickleball court, restaurants, and cafes and send me pics or freq. make references to the following things just listed.

Our mutual friend is included in our group chat and has made us go to dinners all three together. He is introverted and likes things a particular way. We would discuss things like relationship shows or relationships in general. 

A few weeks ago, I sent reels of cafes we could go to, and he said, ‚ÄúThanks, it‚Äôs near my work; I‚Äôm gonna take my boss.‚Äù then, I sent pics of the cafe and loved it.

So I talked to our mutual friend to ask him directly if he liked me. he replied to the mutual guy friend that nothing I am cool, and he sees me only as a friend, and that nothing is going on between us‚Ä¶ therefore, one would assume to give up, right? However, I think he and his friend could possibly be in contact with me and that the friend is also talking to me about him. Triangulation vibes‚Ä¶ so he simply wrote that but didn‚Äôt mean it. I say this because he would be flirty with me and continue to play activities with me that I am no good at (he could enjoy my company rather than focusing on playing seriously). He introduced me to his cousins and family friends the first time we went skating together, invited me to coffee with them afterward, and paid for my order. That day, he told me his cousins were getting married and spoke freely about the topic of marriage and his previous relationships. 

The week after, we played soccer, just us two, and usually, it‚Äôs free, but we went on a Saturday morning, and he offered to hold my bag and paid for the admission to play. It was a very sweet gesture. In-person, he has told me he has fearful avoidant attachment but has worked on it. In previous text messages, he mentioned that the last girl he dated, he never verbally told her he liked her but showed through his actions, and when she told him she didn‚Äôt feel an emotional connection with him, she left a week later after dating for 3 months. 

Thus, despite working on his attachment style, I believe he wouldn‚Äôt necessarily tell me his feelings, either. I am an anxious/ secure attachment, but because I like him so much, I am very anxious and confused about whether he likes me or not.

Turns out they wanted a better view of the other guy throwing a coffee at my head. Knowing the area, they could already be 3 floors up and disappeared into apartments before I even walked around to the bottom of the ramp. 

But in any case, I had no intention of following them. I‚Äôm a fairly large overweight skinhead man in 30‚Äôs, not obvious victim material, so they showed enough lack of fear that if I followed then they could have more shit to throw at me and in any case it not like I can do anything or need to hold them for the cops..

I was wondering if any of you had some advice for overcoming awkwardness/shyness during interviews/coffee chats.

I feel like I always come across as really awkward/shy which is bad because I'm going for very social roles such as finance/consulting. Once I'm comfortable in a role, I feel that I am typically great at opening up, but when first meeting someone, I always get awkward. I especially feel like the start/end of convos is always awkward.

I'm usually not that awkward in other situations. I can be great at the phone when talking to customer service people, and I'm even great at striking up convos with strangers. The situations were I struggle is with interviews/coffee chats with other women. For some reason, I don't really struggle when talking to men (which I attribute to playing video games growing up and always having to code switch), but when talking to professional, go-getter women I tend to get really nervous. I feel like other people are way more well spoken than I am.

I genuinely feel like this is my greatest barrier to doing well in applications so any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I brewed three cups today. After each other, so no side-by-side comparisons. All 12g to 200g in a V60 with April's 50g every 30s technique, finishing the last pour at 1:40.
1. Rather fine grind (80 clicks on a Kingrinder K6). Total brew time almost 3 minutes.
2. Coarser at 95 clicks with 2:20 brew time. Didn't notice a difference.
3. Same as 2, but with Volvic instead of super hard tap water. Still tasted the same, but slightly more acidic. 

That's enough coffee for today. Tomorrow I thought I'd try a very coarse and a very fine grind to taste the extremes and then try a stronger ratio of 70g/L.

What else would you try before deciding it's the beans I don't like that much? Note that I'm new to pourover. ",2,1732290607.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1gxavhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gxavhv/how_to_directly_ask_if_a_guy_friend_has_feelings/,How to directly ask if a guy friend has feelings for me or maybe be more flirty first? Added a TLDR,"**Need Advice. I am F25, and I met a friend, M34, this September. We initially met playing Pickleball and played with some friends from a tennis group or just his different friends for about a month and a half until it got cold outside. I suggested we start playing indoor soccer now‚Äîjust us two- and he suggested indoor skating with me. Before this, I sent a reel regarding cat yoga, and he suggested hot yoga and pilates.**

**The night before, at around 2am, he messaged me to cancel in a series of replies and never rescheduled another time to go. Furthermore, on social media, he would like my Instagram stories of pictures of myself or memes I post, but never anything I post on my feed‚Äîjust an observation. He would remember details about me such as my favourite foods, city, pickleball court, restaurants, and cafes and send me pics or freq. make references to the following things just listed. Once or twice, he has asked me to go to a cafe with him, but we‚Äôve never gone. He preferred only to want to go during the day. Our mutual friend is included in our group chat and has made us go to dinners all three together. He is introverted and likes things a particular way. We would discuss things like relationship shows or relationships in general.**¬†

**A few weeks ago, I sent reels of cafes we could go to, and he said, ‚ÄúThanks, it‚Äôs near my work; I‚Äôm gonna take my boss.‚Äù then, I sent pics of the cafe and loved it. I think my hints of interest for him don‚Äôt actually reach him well. This week, while I was talking to him, I kept receiving what I consider mixed signals from him. One minute, he is super talkative in the messages (in person, he is fine), and then hours go by, and he doesn‚Äôt respond. So I talked to our mutual friend to ask him directly if he liked me. he replied to the mutual guy friend that nothing I am cool, and he sees me only as a friend, and that nothing is going on between us‚Ä¶ therefore, one would assume to give up, right?** 

**However, I think he and his friend could possibly be in contact with me and that the friend is also talking to me about him. Triangulation vibes‚Ä¶ so he simply wrote that but didn‚Äôt mean it. I say this because he would be flirty with me and continue to play activities with me that I am no good at (he could enjoy my company rather than focusing on playing seriously). He introduced me to his cousins and family friends the first time we went skating together, invited me to coffee with them afterward, and paid for my order. That day, he told me his cousins were getting married and spoke freely about the topic of marriage and his previous relationships.**

**The week after, we played soccer, just us two, and usually, it‚Äôs free, but we went on a Saturday morning, and he offered to hold my bag and paid for the admission to play. It was a very sweet gesture. In-person, he has told me he has fearful avoidant attachment but has worked on it. In previous text messages, he mentioned that the last girl he dated, he never verbally told her he liked her but showed through his actions, and when she told him she didn‚Äôt feel an emotional connection with him, she left a week later after dating for 3 months.**¬†

**Thus, despite working on his attachment style, I believe he wouldn‚Äôt necessarily tell me his feelings, either. I am an anxious/ secure attachment, but because I like him so much, I am very anxious and confused about whether he likes me or not. I have become kind of protective of myself and anxious now, wanting to see him and talk to him more often than we do.**¬†

**Now, I am wondering if it seems like he likes me romantically. If so, how do I go about either being more flirty with him or directly asking him if he likes me?**

TLDR: I (F25) met a friend (M34) in September through pickleball. We‚Äôve done various activities together, and he remembers details about me, has introduced me to his family, and paid for outings. He gives mixed signals‚Äîsometimes flirty and attentive, other times distant. He told a mutual friend he sees me as just a friend, but I think he might be unsure due to his fearful-avoidant attachment style. I‚Äôm anxious because I like him and feel confused. Should I be more flirty, or directly ask if he likes me romantically?

It's a cold Saturday morning, and I'm in my garage workshop, finishing up what I thought was a simple cherry wood cabinet project. As I make the final cuts, I notice something unsettling - there's a fine layer of red dust *everywhere*. My black workbench looks like it's been through a Mars storm, my coffee cup (rookie mistake leaving it uncovered) has a suspicious reddish tint, and my nose... well, let's just say cherry wood dust isn't as pleasant as cherry pie.

This was my breaking point. After five years of ""making do"" with a shop vac and the occasional broom ritual, I decided it was time to get serious about dust collection. Enter the Delta Shopmaster TS300, my journey into proper dust management, and what I've learned after a full year of use.

# The Technical Beast: Breaking Down the TS300 üí™

First, let's get the nerdy stuff out of the way. Here's what you're looking at with the TS300:

# Comprehensive Specifications

|Feature|Specification|Notes from Experience|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Motor Power|1.5 HP|Consistent performance|
|Voltage|120V|Standard outlet compatible|
|Airflow|600 CFM|Actual measured: \~550 CFM|
|Bag Capacity|30 gallons|Usually lasts 2-3 weeks|
|Noise Level|85 dB|Measured at 3 feet distance|
|Filter Rating|2 microns|Captures fine dust well|
|Weight|105 lbs|Heavy but manageable|
|Inlet Size|Dual 4"" ports|Can be combined to 6""|
|Impeller Size|12 inches|Cast aluminum|
|Base Footprint|44"" x 19""|Compact for its capacity|

# The Real-World Experience üõ†Ô∏è

# Initial Setup and Learning Curve

When the TS300 arrived, I was both excited and intimidated. Here's what my first week looked like:

1. **Day One**:
   * Unboxing (took about 30 minutes)
   * Assembly (2 hours, including multiple coffee breaks)
   * *Pro tip*: The manual says you need two people. Listen to the manual.
2. **First Week Challenges**:
   * Figuring out optimal placement
   * Learning the proper startup sequence
   * Dealing with my first bag change (messier than expected)

# The Good, The Bad, and The Dusty

# What I Love ‚ù§Ô∏è

* **Power Delivery**: The 1.5 HP motor isn't just marketing speak. It handles everything from my table saw to my thickness planer without breaking a sweat.
* **Consistent Performance**: Even after a year of heavy use, the suction remains strong.
* **Mobility**: The wheeled base makes repositioning surprisingly easy.
* **Filter Efficiency**: The 2-micron filtration actually makes a noticeable difference in air quality.

# What Could Be Better ü§î

1. **The Zipper Situation**
   * *The Issue*: The bag zipper started showing wear after 6 months
   * *My Solution*: Added reinforcement strips and now use a specific technique for removal
2. **Noise Levels**
   * *The Reality*: It's loud. Really loud.
   * *My Fix*: Built a partial enclosure with sound-dampening foam

# Performance Analysis: By the Numbers üìä

After tracking performance over various projects, here's what I found:

# Dust Collection Efficiency

|Tool Type|Collection Efficiency|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Table Saw|95%|Nearly perfect with proper hood|
|Planer|98%|Best performance|
|Router Table|85%|Depends on fence setup|
|Bandsaw|80%|Requires additional port|
|Miter Saw|75%|Challenging to contain|

# Installation Tips: Learn from My Mistakes üîß

# Optimal Setup Configuration

**Ducting Considerations**

**Space Organization**

Workshop Layout Example: \[Collector\] ----main line----                  |                  +---\[Table Saw\]                  |                  +---\[Planer\]                  |                  +---\[Router Table\]

# Real Projects, Real Results üèóÔ∏è

# The Kitchen Cabinet Test

Last month, I tackled a full kitchen cabinet set in maple. Here's what I observed:

* **Before TS300**:
   * 4-hour cleanup after each day
   * Dust everywhere
   * Constant filter clogging
* **With TS300**:
   * 30-minute cleanup
   * Minimal airborne dust
   * One bag change for entire project

I wanted to reach out to this thread to talk about something that‚Äôs been going on for the past few weeks. Me and my partner like to walk to the nearby town every Thursday for a coffee date and on the way home we always run into this one cat, however she follows us from a distance and is very wary of us at times but occasionally wants to come for a pet. She doesn‚Äôt have a collar but she seems slightly overweight. She‚Äôs skittish of dogs and cars moving past. She follows us 5 minutes up the road and proceeds to meow and cries at us and waits outside our door for an hour. We have never fed her, only ever said hello to her which is odd because I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs a cat trying to chance her luck to get another house to go to. We stay with my partners parents and their mum said we aren‚Äôt allowed to bring the cat in to take to the vet to check for a microchip because we don‚Äôt have a carrier or anything for the cat which is fair enough. We called our local RSPCA and they said that we have to either call the council or cats protection. Does anyone have any other advice for this? We really aren‚Äôt sure if she‚Äôs a lost cat because she cries at our door or she‚Äôs just chancing her luck and trying to make us feel sorry for her (which is very much working because I feel very sad when I hear her crying at the door) any advice would be much appreciated :) ",2,1732290323.0,CatsUK,6,1.0,False

Coffee shop has been a tenant for 7 years hasnt been able to pay rent for past month, one year left on lease. He was an absentee owner who purchaed the business from the orginal owners during Covid. He wants to sell the business to a couple from Turkey who will run the coffee shop themselves. Problem is when they submitted the applicatio to take over lease,, they dont have any assets and couldnt do a credit check because they dont have social security numbers.  Not sure how they would buy the business from him,  but I'm sure the owner is probably selling it for basically nothing. Either way, I have reservations about agreeing.  I'm sure running it as a 'mom and pop' would be more financially viable than the current owner (no employee costs), but I'd be essentially betting on the tenants. I'd probably ask for several months rent up front but I'm sure they wouldn't be able to do that - on the lease application for assets they put 49k in turkish dollars and a 2015 Prius :/

Robots (2005): the robots can have kids via mail order. They build the kids (""making the baby is the fun part""), robot barber shop with tin snips and grinders, the old lady in the opening scene winding up her pigeons, the neighbor waxing/polishing his lawn, the chipping paint on the mom's hair to represent graying hair, the dad has sink stoppers for ears, the 'cigars' in the opening scene being parts of car exhausts, etc.

Bluey: from a veterinary stand point this show is fascinating! Normal dog behavior is still shown (Socks biting, walking on all fours, ball fetching!). The fact that heart worm is a risk! (Granpa Mort) The Doberman family having docked tails and ears. Using the 'big girl bark' to let Bandit know the play is too rough! 

Bojack Horseman: the birds still fly, Bojack spooks easily, the whole under water episode, Chickens explaining how meat animals are different from friend animals, the debutant ball with Beatrice jumping hurdles, etc.

Zootopia asking and answering questions how would a giraffe get their morning coffee!

The Emoji movie: the story is horrible, but the world building is fascinating. Each app had a different setting, the choice to make a music app an ocean of sound is amazing! The rough choppy seas of heavy metal and the calm ripples of whale songs to navigate by boat.

1gxan70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1gxan70/the_portrait_of_an_indian_woman_as_a_young/,THE PORTRAIT OF AN INDIAN WOMAN AS A YOUNG DIVORCEE,"

She sits at the edge of her world, a chipped mug of coffee in her hand. The steam rises, curling like the stale gossip that sticks to her name in family WhatsApp groups. A divorcee. A failure. Another woman who couldn‚Äôt make it work. That‚Äôs what they say.

She wanted to be an IAS officer, once. Big dreams, sharp dreams. But her father was a doctor, her uncle too. Her kid sister? A gynecologist now. So, they shoved her into medicine like they were loading a truck. She was good at it, sure. Good enough to pass. Good enough to put up with the patients waiting outside while she sipped her coffee, slow. Good enough to feel like a fraud.

Then there was him. The writer with no money and big ideas. She met him at 22, fell hard, moved in. He quit his engineering job to chase words and blank pages. He said it was freedom. She called it unpaid labor. The money from her parents barely stretched. She cooked his meals, washed his clothes, swept his floors. She edited his sentences when they were weak, tightened his metaphors when they slumped. She carried the weight of him, and he let her.

When he conned his parents into paying for his journalism degree, nothing changed except that he spent less time with her. He said the coursework was brutal. She said nothing. When he finally landed a job, it paid him crumbs. But crumbs are better than nothing, and for once, she let herself believe this was the start of something.

It wasn‚Äôt.

He became the guy who worked 16-hour days. He became the guy who touched his laptop more than her. He became the guy she visited every two months after she took a government job back in her hometown. It was like visiting a stranger she used to know.

She stayed anyway. She thought she owed him that much. Years of her life poured into building him into someone the world respected. The guy who earned a six-figure salary. The guy who came from nothing but was now everything, except hers.

And then her father ended up in the ICU. She begged him to come. He didn‚Äôt. He had deadlines, he said. That‚Äôs when she knew. She packed up her hope, shoved it in a corner, and signed the damn divorce papers.

The aunties wagged their tongues, called it rebellion. She calls it survival. One life. That‚Äôs all she‚Äôs got.

Now she sits at her desk. Sometimes she cries. Mostly she works. The mornings are still gray, but at least they belong to her.

She rolls her sleeves, not for a man or for a meal, but for something better. Something she can‚Äôt see yet but feels deep in her gut, like the first throb of a new bruise.

When the world looks at her, it sees damage. A broken thing. She looks in the mirror and sees a crack.

The kind of crack where the light gets in.",10,1732289966.0,Divorce,3,0.92,False

1gxails,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gxails/i_have_a_gift_idea_for_a_friend_whos_been_going/,I have a gift idea for a friend who's been going through a rough time but a mutual friend who's known them much longer thinks it's a bad idea.,"I started working at a new job this year and have become close friends with two co-workers who have known each other for over 20 years. The three of us have become a very tight knit group, getting coffee and lunch together almost every day, sharing a lot of in-jokes, and sending each other memes and chatting late at night. We all have very silly senses of humour and frequently make one another laugh to the point of tears.

One of these friends (let's call her Friend A) finished her university degree a few weeks ago, and by all accounts it was a really stressful time with loads of assessments due. Her dog she'd had for 14 years died during this period as well, which really impacted her and kept her from coming into the office or responding to messages for several days. She also had to move out of her apartment on short notice as the owner was selling, only to end up somewhere she quickly realised wasn't right for her and had to move again just a few weeks later.

The week after Friend A's dog died, Friend B told me to not be overly warm to Friend A when she finally re-emerged. She didn't think Friend A would respond too well to tenderness, and said it would be better to just be like ""Oh, hi dickhead!"" when she returned to the office. I trust her and how well she knows Friend A, so took the advice. When Friend A finally started responding to our messages again, she confirmed she would rather we not be too warm or gentle with her, as it might make her emotional.

I'm known for being sort of the ""wholesome"" one in the group. Not that they are any less nice than me (they are both lovely), but I'm the one most likely to just say a nice thing without making it into a joke immediately afterwards. So they both knew I would struggle with this, and made a few jokes at my floundering attempts to not be ""too nice"". On Friend A's first day back in the office, she could see how much I was struggling with this, but it actually seemed to cheer her up, to the point that halfway through the day she let me off the hook and said she was ok with me being nice. The three of us ended up laughing loads that day, and I told Friend A how great it was to have her back and that I'd missed her. That evening, she posted to her Instagram how great her day had been and how much better it made her feel after such an emotional week.

She's told me she's doing much better now. She's living with her partner and seems to really love that as well as where they are located. She's also really stoked to be done with university, and has been relishing having time to rest and recuperate. She understandably hasn't come out for any work social things while all this has been going on, but this weekend the three of us plus a fourth co-worker we really get along with (let's call him Friend C), as well as each of our partners, are going out for drinks and dinner together. We checked in with how she was feeling about it this week and she seemed very keen and ready to socialise again.

I suggested to Friends B and C that we could get or make her a little present so she knows how appreciated she is. Friend C loved the idea, but Friend B has been really discouraging. She's insistent that she knows this isn't Friend A's love language, and I trust that considering how long they've known one another.

For context, about 2 months ago (before all this happened), Friend B had to work interstate for a week, and was feeling quite unappreciated by management at the time. She was also bummed to be missing out on all the coffee runs and jokes that would happen between me and Friend A while she was away. I had the idea that Friend A and I should make a silly booklet of our favourite memes, but with the captions edited to express how great we think Friend B is. We had loads of fun putting this together, and printed it on the company's document template and stapled and left it in Friend B's drawer. When she was back in office the next week, she saw what looked like some work report left for her, only to realise it was just pages of nice messages from Friend A and me. We even made a game out of it where she had to tick on each page whether she thought Friend A or I had made that particular meme. She seemed to really appreciate it and all three of us had a good laugh.

So seeing how much Friend B appreciated that, and how keen Friend A was to be involved, I thought doing something similar for Friend A might be appreciated. I hopped onto Canva and made a fake university graduation certificate, using the name of our groupchat as the name of the university, using the names of the reminders Friend A had set in her work calendar in the lead up to her final day of university as the names of the courses she was ""graduating"" from, used a screenshot of our favourite gif as the sort of academic stamp/seal. I also had myself, Friend B and Friend C listed as the academic supervisors, but instead of titles under our names I used the various nicknames Friend A has for us each.

I think it actually turned out really great. Simultaneously both sillier and nicer than I had expected. I sent it to Friend B and C to get their feedback and Friend C thought it was excellent. But Friend B strongly felt it was a bad idea. She said she recognises it comes from a nice place, but she knows Friend A well enough to know it's too big of a gesture and will make her feel overwhelmed. She's insistent Friend A's love language is quality time, so the four of us plus our partners hanging out this weekend will be enough to make her feel appreciated.

As I said earlier, I'm inclined to trust her judgement considering how well she knows her. I suggested that instead of giving it to her this weekend and making a big deal out of it, we could do a similar thing to what Friend A and I did for Friend B with the booklet of memes, and just hide it on her desk somewhere at work. Friend B didn't think that was a good idea idea. Friend C suggested we could just give it to Friend A casually while we're on one of our coffee runs. But Friend B also didn't like that idea.

I trust both Friend B's intentions and judgement, but I feel weird about not being able to give something small I made to a friend because a mutual friend disagrees. While Friend C isn't as close as the three of us, he has worked with Friend A for almost 3 years now and they really get along. So surely his opinion counts for something too?

And even though I've only worked there 7 months, I feel I've gotten to know Friend A quite well. I saw how much she enjoyed making the meme booklet with me for Friend B. She made a point of expressing how much fun we had together the day she returned to the office after her dog died. A few times Friend A and I accidentally wore the same colour shirt to work and people asked if we were intentionally matching. After it happened enough times we decided to actually match every single item of clothing one day (even down to the colour of belt, shoes, and both wearing a pair of silly socks that had animals on them) and played it off as if it was an accident again. She even joked that we should do it again, but this time show up with matching fake tattoos. Before I started working there, the company went through a restructure and a few people were let go. Friend A, B, C and a few other people made absurd farewell videos for these departing colleagues, parodying series like The Office and Succession. Friend A was the one to tell me about these videos, and was excited to dig out the files to show them to me.

So I've witnessed first hand how much appetite she has for silly gestures. I've witnessed how much she loves creating and being part of in-jokes. I've witnessed how much she loves getting involved in creative or silly gift ideas. I get that giving and receiving a gift are two different things. I get that my 7 months of knowing her is absolutely dwarfed by someone who has known her for over 20 years. But surely it must still count for something?

I get that people have different love languages as well. For context, quality time is also my main love language. Being able to work alongside these friends and get coffee and lunch with them and share in-jokes makes me feel loved, and satiates my want to express my love for them. I don't NEED to give her this small gift to express love, I just think it would be nice and would probably make her roll her eyes and laugh, and hopefully be a little reminder of how much she's appreciated.

I'm also aware that sometimes the people who have known us the longest can make assumptions based on past knowledge. I've historically been someone who has avoided making a big deal out of events relating to me. I've discouraged people from giving me gifts in the past, and whenever I've left a job I've requested that people don't give me a card or anything. But there have also been several times where friends have ignored that advice and surprised me in ways that have been wonderful. Four years ago I left a job to move overseas, and agreed to come out for a drink with everyone after my final shift. When I got there, everyone was dressed up as various things to do with me, whether it be a character from my favourite show, an actor I have a crush on, one colleague even dressed up AS ME. A few years before that I was part of a community of local writers, and I left to go on a working holiday. Before I left, the other writers in the group gifted me a bound book of poems they had each written about me.

If you had told me about either of these things before they happened, I would have said ""please no, I don't want that"". The idea of being the recipient of that kind of attention would have made me cringe and shrivel. But I appreciated those instances so much because they were personal. They weren't just big gestures for the sake of it, where people are writing obligatory notes in a card or going through the motions to sing a song. They were people who knew me and put what they knew about me into a thoughtful gift. Gift giving isn't my main love language. It honestly doesn't even crack my top three (words of affirmation and physical touch would definitely be higher). But I can't help but recognise and appreciate that level of sincere thought.

I know Friend A. Not as well as Friend B knows her, but well enough to believe she would find the gift funny. Yeah, she'll probably cringe a little, but I think she will appreciate the silliness of it and the references to various in-jokes. She has seen first hand that I like doing stuff like this, and she was keen to be involved when we made the booklet for Friend B. I know Friend B is looking out for Friend A, but I just can't get around the fact the only way to respect this is to accept a dynamic where Friend A is excited to help me make a gift for Friend B, but Friend B is discouraging me making a gift for Friend A. I feel like I'm in some weird position where I can't do a nice thing for a friend because I didn't get the right permission.

It doesn't feel right, but I trust Friend B, and I don't want to do the wrong thing by Friend A. What should I do?

1gxafmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/darkretreat/comments/1gxafmx/10_frequently_asked_questions_about_dark_retreats/,10 frequently asked questions about dark retreats,"Here are 10 common FAQs about dark retreats and their answers:

## 1. What is a dark retreat?

A dark retreat is a solo retreat conducted in complete darkness and sensory deprivation, typically lasting 3-5 days or longer. Participants stay in a specially designed room or cabin that blocks out all light[5].

## 2. How long should I book for a dark retreat?

For beginners, 3-5 days is generally recommended. Those with more meditation and retreat experience may opt for longer periods. It's important to carefully consider how many days you feel ready for[1].

## 3. What can I expect during a dark retreat?

Experiences vary, but may include:
- Heightened senses and emotions
- Vivid dreams and visions
- Shifts in perception of time
- Surfacing of subconscious thoughts
- Periods of boredom and restlessness
- Potential insights and realizations[4]

## 4. Is it safe to spend extended time in total darkness?

Yes, if done correctly. Dangers are easily avoided when proper precautions are taken. Retreats are voluntary, and participants can leave at any time[2].

## 5. Do you eat during a dark retreat?

Yes, food and water are typically provided. Some retreats offer vegetarian meals delivered at set times[1][2].

## 6. How do you navigate in complete darkness?

Slowly and carefully. Familiarize yourself with the room layout beforehand. Practice moving around blindfolded before starting. Keep your arms in front of you when moving to avoid bumping into things[2].

## 7. Will I get bored?

Boredom is common and can be seen as a positive sign. It may indicate that the unconscious mind is approaching areas that have been shut off emotionally[2].

## 8. Can I leave the retreat early if needed?

Yes, participants typically have access to a key and can leave at any time if necessary[2].

## 9. How do you prepare for a dark retreat?

Eat healthily, avoid alcohol, coffee, and sugar for a few days prior. Get good sleep and come with an open mind. Some retreats offer preparation guidance[1].

## 10. What is it like coming out of the darkness?

Re-emerging into light can be a gradual process. Some report continued visions or heightened sensory experiences. It's often recommended to allow time for integration after the retreat[5].

I'm Clyde McDive, and yes, that's right, you're Live at 5!

Today, we're sliding into the digital age with Yahoo's new AI feature that promises to summarize articles for our fast-paced lives. Now, let's break it down, shall we?

First off, I must commend Yahoo for making strides in technology. The idea of using AI to generate takeaways is as futuristic as it is practical. It's like having a little robot buddy whispering sweet summaries into your ear while you sip your morning coffee.

But here's where the waters get a bit choppy, my friends. The article mentions that sometimes the AI-generated takeaways might not always match the article content. That's right folks‚Äîour robot buddies aren‚Äôt perfect just yet! Now, that raises a few eyebrows, doesn't it? As much as we love a good innovation, accuracy should be our guiding star in journalism.

Sure, it sounds convenient, but what good is a shortcut if it leads you the wrong way, right? That's like expecting Siri to win you a Nobel Prize just because she can read you Shakespeare‚Äîkind of loses its charm.

The writer of the original piece did a bang-up job highlighting the potential pitfalls of this AI initiative. They've opened up a dialogue about the intersection of technology and truth‚Äîsomething we should all be wise to these days!

So, where do we stand, beloved audience? Is it a nifty tool for the multitaskers, or a Pandora's box for miscommunication? My advice? Stay vigilant, stay curious, and maybe keep an old-fashioned human-generated article in your back pocket just in case!

Stay smart, stay savvy, and never stop questioning. After all, that's the kind of world we deserve! Until next time, this is Clyde McDive, diving out‚Äîyou're Live at 5!",1,1732289363.0,u_Bstillbstill23,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs see. My girlfriend wants to essentially open a coffee truck someday. 
Her obsession is coffee. Coffee, lattes, cold brews, you name it. 

‚Ä¶. But we haven‚Äôt dipped into actually making espresso yet. 

This was a Christmas gift for her to start experimenting at home. Something great for beginners, but something we can grow into and learn. Whats the best ‚Äúentry level‚Äù machine and grinder set up, along with coffee beans to start this journey. I‚Äôve done countless hours of research on the machines and it seems the bambino, barista express, Sylvia, ect. Start with a better grinder. Or do we go with a dual boiler. Something with more pressure, ect. 

I just need help (with links) on getting started. Budget is not a huge factor, but what‚Äôs the best bang for the buck that will last us. This is just pushing her to start her hobby. 

I‚Äôve been hearing it‚Äôs about the best grinder set up first. Second is the heating element, pressure, ect. 

She‚Äôs basically a food scientist and has the right taste when she goes to various coffee shops. So I think once she learns the machine it she‚Äôll dig into it more and more. My thoughts are the bambino with a recommended grinder‚Ä¶.. and which coffee beans I would appreciate a recommendation.

How much is too much? 


I met this guy who seemed quiet and low key. We had a couple conversations and met for a coffee. He seemed nice and we talked about music n stuff. He was friendly and polite. He even paid for my coffee and muffin. It was nice and he was polite. 

I told him I had to leave to for a very busy convention and came back to so many messages, like 12. Telling me he missed me, he can‚Äôt wait to see me, asking why I am not replying (I made it clear I would be extremely busy and wouldn‚Äôt be able to message for few days), I didn‚Äôt even open the app. 

I told him I would be available next week after the holiday because it‚Äôs so busy and we just met. 

I also got mysterious flowers at my office. I was quite careful about my privacy. He did ask my favorite flower and they happen to be them. 

This is my first attempt to try to date after my break-up and it feels like he is super clingy. 

How do I approach him about this? I am not even sure I want to approach him about this. It‚Äôs hard for me to tell if this is just too much.

Need advice on how to forgive him,"My fianc√© has been lying to be about porn for 2 months when I disclosed I don‚Äôt want it as a part of my relationship. We both used to watch it and I thought I was okay with it, but my ex had a porn addiction and it left me very traumatized. My fianc√© does not view it in the same compulsive manner as my ex, but he can‚Äôt stop it. He finally came clean to me last week and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

Initially, I had just asked him to try to quit for a month so we could both assess our dependency (I worried I may have been dependent on it as well). I went 3 weeks without it, and I thought he did as well. I then started feeling guilty for being controlling and suggested we watch it together, and that we restart the month detox. We did, and everything was fine, and I went 3 weeks without it again. 

I checked in with him a few times and he said he was drinking more coffee at work (he only masturbates at work in a single cubicle bathroom, he says he does it because of my trauma and he doesn‚Äôt want to do it at home while I‚Äôm there) and going on walks/staying busy. Anyway, he finally breaks down and tells me he hasn‚Äôt quit, he‚Äôs been watching it at least twice a week, and lying to me about it. 

He also admitted to imagining porn while we were having sex to maintain his erection, but he confessed he also thought about two girls he liked before he started dating me - both of them rejected him. They‚Äôre petite Asians and look nothing like me. I feel like a sex toy. 

I can get over porn 1-2 a week if that‚Äôs something he needs. I don‚Äôt want to control his body and respect he does it away from me. I‚Äôve even tried watching porn with him a handful of times and each time I feel like it‚Äôs a third person in our sex life and hate it. But I can‚Äôt seem to move past the lying and gaslighting, and the fact he used me as a masturbatory aid for his fantasies about real people. He said it‚Äôs common. I‚Äôve never done it. 

I love this man and want to marry him, but I‚Äôve been punishing and scrutinizing him for a week. He said he would quit the porn and he hasn‚Äôt watched it in a week and I believe him, but I told him it‚Äôs not about the porn (fine, maybe he‚Äôs bored/anxious/stressed at work and I get it‚Äôs just easier) but also the fact I‚Äôm alwaaaays down to have sex and he‚Äôs rejected me a few times in the past - no I wonder if it was because he watched porn that day. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I want to forgive him and move on and stop thinking about this and the fact that he might watch porn when he goes to work. I‚Äôm just in so much pain that I even suggested we make our own videos after all this and he has them but I feel so lowly about myself I‚Äôm not even sure he‚Äôll watch them. And for clarification, I watch porn too, and did before I met him as well - I just know I can leave it, but he can‚Äôt. ",2,1732289040.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I need to vent to y'alls. 
I followed a histamine low elimination diet for 2 weeks, i kept protocol and now began introducing different foods again, to see if I have a negative reaction. 

It completely spiraled out of control tonight. 
I had a coffee at 6 pm yesterday which was probably the reason for my resctions. 
I read before bed time and then woke up wide awake at 2 am in the night, overheating and my heart was hammering away.
I tried everything. I took two Dibondrin which made me quite sleepy but my mind was still full of racing thoughts. 
At that point it was 11 am and I still hadn't found sleep. 
I lay in bed for 3-4 hours now, i tried desperately to fall asleep and talking gently to myself. 
It literally feels like my heart is gonna burst out of my chest any mommeent, its beating so fast and I feel like I'm close to a panic attack. 
I also have endometriosis and use Tramadol to treat the pain and took one today because it makes me very sleepy. 
Now I see what a bad combo that was, mixing anti histamines with Tramadol. :(
I feel like im never gonna get better, every time I'm in bed and waiting for sleep, i only stare at the ceiling, unable to find even an hour of sleep. 
This is so exhausting and it's taking a mental toll on me. 
It wasnt smart to drink coffee right bedore bed, even with a daosin before. 
Now I can't even get up because the world is spinning. 
Other symptoms im experiencing: flushing, overheating, headache, sensitivity to sound and light and indigestion. 
I just needed to vent my feelings out foe a second. I also contacted my doctor and asked for advice but I have to wait till Monday for het response.

This is my 3rd time visiting Phuket, but previously it was over 10 years ago, so I have no idea what's it like there now.

We are mostly interested in tours, such as island hopping, zipline, and tours in general during the day time and evenings maybe nice but not fine dinning type restaurants and coffee shops,, we are interested in mostly seafood or street food, what would be the best area? Both times I had previously I stayed near Bangla Road and Patong beach, but seems like due to high season it's extremely overpriced and it's going very crowded, where would be next best area to stay in where there tour guides, restaurants and all are available without the all nightlife.

How do I move past this?,"My fianc√© has been lying to be about porn for 2 months when I disclosed I don‚Äôt want it as a part of my relationship. We both used to watch it and I thought I was okay with it, but my ex had a porn addiction and it left me very traumatized. My fianc√© does not view it in the same compulsive manner as my ex, but he can‚Äôt stop it. He finally came clean to me last week and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

Initially, I had just asked him to try to quit for a month so we could both assess our dependency (I worried I may have been dependent on it as well). I went 3 weeks without it, and I thought he did as well. I then started feeling guilty for being controlling and suggested we watch it together, and that we restart the month detox. We did, and everything was fine, and I went 3 weeks without it again. 

I checked in with him a few times and he said he was drinking more coffee at work (he only masturbates at work in a single cubicle bathroom, he says he does it because of my trauma and he doesn‚Äôt want to do it at home while I‚Äôm there) and going on walks/staying busy. Anyway, he finally breaks down and tells me he hasn‚Äôt quit, he‚Äôs been watching it at least twice a week, and lying to me about it. 

He also admitted to imagining porn while we were having sex to maintain his erection, but he confessed he also thought about two girls he liked before he started dating me - both of them rejected him. They‚Äôre petite Asians and look nothing like me. I feel like a sex toy. 

I can get over porn 1-2 a week if that‚Äôs something he needs. I don‚Äôt want to control his body and respect he does it away from me. I‚Äôve even tried watching porn with him a handful of times and each time I feel like it‚Äôs a third person in our sex life and hate it. But I can‚Äôt seem to move past the lying and gaslighting, and the fact he used me as a masturbatory aid for his fantasies about real people. He said it‚Äôs common. I‚Äôve never done it. 

I love this man and want to marry him, but I‚Äôve been punishing and scrutinizing him for a week. He said he would quit the porn and he hasn‚Äôt watched it in a week and I believe him, but I told him it‚Äôs not about the porn (fine, maybe he‚Äôs bored/anxious/stressed at work and I get it‚Äôs just easier) but also the fact I‚Äôm alwaaaays down to have sex and he‚Äôs rejected me a few times in the past - no I wonder if it was because he watched porn that day. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I want to forgive him and move on and stop thinking about this and the fact that he might watch porn when he goes to work. I‚Äôm just in so much pain that I even suggested we make our own videos after all this and he has them but I feel so lowly about myself I‚Äôm not even sure he‚Äôll watch them. And for clarification, I watch porn too, and did before I met him as well - I just know I can leave it, but he can‚Äôt. ",1,1732288790.0,loveafterporn,0,1.0,False

1gxa5d1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/1gxa5d1/amok_equipment_draumr_50_xl/,Amok Equipment Draumr 5.0 xl,"Hey fellow hammockers,

I recently followed my own rule of Buy Once - Cry Once and bought a Draumr XL.
After years of hammock camping i wanted to sleep on a straight surface and a more spacious environment without giving up the luxury of a quick setup.
One thing ahead, I'm a lil bit taller guy, around 2.05m.
My recent setup has been a lightweight hammock, underquilt, tarp and seasonal sleeping bag or blanket.
It's always been fine but not always that comfy. So I needed an improvement for a good nights sleep

Setting up the Draumr was easy as hell. 
Literally couldn't be easier. Tying the treestraps around your chosen trees and connecting them to the hammock via a plate system fitting into each other.
That's it.
Just tighten the strips until the Ridgeline is level and you're done.

Next comes blowing up the mattress. 
It comes with a pump bag and it's done in under a minute.
The mattress is quiet warm, we had around -3 degrees and it was cozy from underneath. 
The mattress has an own compartment in the hammock with a zipper and a cut out edge, I didn't really knew the purpose of. It fits with the valve for in- and deflating the mattress, while it's zipped in, so you can adjust it to your liking. 

And that's it, the whole setup process.

The only thing difficult- or better said the only thing hilarious for your companionship- is the first moment boarding your hammock. 
It's wiggly, you don't know where to pit your weight at - so I jumped straight in and hoped for the best. It worked.
The best way to enter us flipping back the foot part and sitting inside the hammock while flipping it back where it belongs.

The adjustability of your angle laying down are great, you can lift and decline your upper body area and feet area trough small straps that you can pull all while laying down. That gives you the sensation of using it as a cozy lounging chair, while talking or targeting your snoring problem trough sleeping with a lifted upper body.
It even gives drinking your coffee in the morning while still being in your backpack a luxurious feeling.
It really adapts to your needs. 

Sleep itself was amazing, laying on my side, back and stomach was no problem, turning around with accidents and waking up with no backpack- simply amazing.
The extra space trough the angled sides, where I stored my clothes, powerbank, phones and so on even allows you sleeping with an angled knee pulled up to your side. 

As a summary I'd say, if you need your best nights sleep ever, while being outdoors, get this hammock!
Your tall as heck? Get this hammock!
Backpack? You guessed it, this freakin hammock! 

This setup might not be the lightest one, but for sure gives you all the rest you need with a luxurious feeling, while containing a rugged and durable quality for long term use. 

I used:
Amok Draumr 5.0 XL green
Fjol XL mattress

Most of my friends are busy with their lives na - some in abroad, some already have family or focused in relationships, for some we just grew apart. Meron pa rin friends nag aaya ng gala pero like once a year lang.

I work from home kaya rare na makapag socialize. Oks naman sakin low maintenance, one time or temporary friendship lang (not asking/expecting much). Oks din sakin kahit group of friends na isasama ako sa gala kahit one time lang haha

About me:

* Introvert pero makwento naman pag komportable na
* Nasa coffee shops pag sabado o linggo - studying / upskilling as I work in the tech field. You can also study or read books in silence with me. Oks din sakin ibang activities like bowling, table tennis, ktv, chill inom/party (though I don‚Äôt really drink/party,  siguro would try lang if may mag aya) etc.
* Tuturuan ka/kayo mag mahjong if gusto mo matuto haha - you can bring other friends too kasi 4 players to pero pwede na rin siguro kahit 2 players lang. Problem lang kung san pwede maglaro hahaha - dali para ma review natin yung mahjong scene sa Crazy rich asians haha jk.
* Not really into romantic relationships - I‚Äôm so greedy for my self/alone time and focused sa career or ibang hobbies
* Sometimes I disappear after socializing pero as long as you consider me a friend, we‚Äôre goods naman the next time we talk/hang out.


About you:
*Around Ortigas sana para in case mag hang out madali lang gumala.

If nag message ka na sakin dati, you can try to PM me again, ni replayan ko lang talaga yung unang 2 na nag PM sakin dati, hirap din ma maintain usap dati kasi mostly busy the past few weeks and umuuwi rin sa province, maybe I can try to make (more) friends again this time.

You know that feeling when you just ended a meeting and the only thing you want to do is enjoy a cup of coffee and focus on smashing your tasks?

But then you realize you‚Äôre the one who has to create the tasks, define the briefs, and structure them in a clear way.

This process can waste time, kill productivity, and is always prone to missing key details.

When we spoke to users about how they were approaching project management we learnt just how time consuming the process of analysing meeting insights and creating Linear issues was.

Now - with the new Linear integration for Tactiq users can run a workflow that automatically:

 ‚Ä¢ Extracts tasks for Linear issues from meeting transcript.
 ‚Ä¢ Formats issues based on your personalized structure needs.
 ‚Ä¢ Creates issues in Linear in the backlog automatically, ready to be assigned, prioritized, and added to cycles

No more time spent on creating issues and task briefs. No more mistakes caused by missed details and poorly defined issues. No more guesswork where to begin - have all your priorities ready to go.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

1gx9twi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gx9twi/aio_about_my_boyfriend_female_friend/,AIO about my boyfriend female friend ,"Me (F18) and my boyfriend (M19) have been together for two years. During this time, he made it clear that I cannot have male friends. I used to work at a pizzeria, and while I was training, there was a guy there‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Bob. Bob and I would just talk as friends. My boyfriend saw us talking and got upset, so I told Bob I couldn‚Äôt talk to him anymore because of my boyfriend, and Bob understood. Later, my boyfriend would drop off food at my job, and Bob started talking to him as a friend. Eventually, they became friends, but I still didn‚Äôt talk to Bob because I didn‚Äôt want to cause problems with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend works at a coffee shop, and this girl, Erika, trained him. I sometimes waited for him outside work or stayed there doing homework, and I would see how close they were. They laughed together, had inside jokes, and seemed to have a really strong connection. I didn‚Äôt like it‚Äînot because she‚Äôs a girl, but because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have male friends at my job, so I felt like it wasn‚Äôt fair. I told him to stop talking to her, but he said he couldn‚Äôt because it would be awkward not to talk to her since they were coworkers, and he enjoys their conversations because they share the same sense of humor.

Over time, we fought about this, but he still refused to stop talking to her. He would sometimes mention how funny she was or how they defended each other from rude customers. But when we were out and someone was rude to me, he wouldn‚Äôt defend me; he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not confrontational.‚Äù He always agreed with what Erika said, but if I disagreed with him, he‚Äôd argue with me, even if I was right. For example, if I said the world was flat, he‚Äôd argue and Google it to prove me wrong, but if Erika said the world was flat, he‚Äôd agree with her without question.

Erika also shared personal and traumatic experiences with him, and I felt like you have to be really close to someone to open up like that.

We took a break from each other, but not because of this issue. When we got back together, we agreed to keep it quiet, but one day I called him at work, and Erika saw his phone. She gave him a look of dissatisfaction and said oh you guys are back together, and he told me he couldn‚Äôt speak to me because she was right there. I asked him to tell her it was none of her business, but he refused, saying it would be mean and he wasn‚Äôt confrontational. I got really upset, called him repeatedly, and yelled at him to cut her off. Eventually, he asked what he should say, and I realized it wasn‚Äôt healthy to keep pushing him like that, especially since it seemed like he didn‚Äôt want to cut her off.

Recently, Erika got fired for stealing money from the cashier, and my boyfriend was really sad and worried if she would be able to pay rent.

There is also this other girl named Cynthia, whom he spoke to while we were on a break. He told me he never really liked her and found her annoying. But when were talking again before we made it official, they continued texting. I went through their messages, and they had long, fluid conversations that seemed fun. He also still had pictures of her on his phone and claimed he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to delete them. Also, when me and him made it official I told him to block Cynthia but he said he couldn‚Äôt because he works with her and it would be awkward but then he ended up blocking her more faster than Erika. There were just so many inconsistencies in what he would tell me. I feel like he only said he didn‚Äôt like her because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me, but yesterday we had a huge fight. Every time I bring it up, he gets so explosive and acts very suspicious.

So, like any girl would, I went for a tarot card reading, and it said that he would never take Erika seriously, but found her very attractive. With Cynthia, it said he didn‚Äôt like her appearance and hated her flaws, but he felt heard, special, and freer when he was with her, and he was happier with her.

I‚Äôve spoken to other men, but I was honest about it, blocked them, and never hung out with them. I only went on one date and ghosted him after. But when my boyfriend brings up my past, I talk to him and reassure him, while he can‚Äôt do the same for me because his actions say something completely different from what he tells me.",0,1732287813.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.5,False

1gx9exw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gx9exw/my_boyfriend_defends_his_female_friend/,My boyfriend defends his female friend ,"Me (F18) and my boyfriend (M19) have been together for two years. During this time, he made it clear that I cannot have male friends. I used to work at a pizzeria, and while I was training, there was a guy there‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Bob. Bob and I would just talk as friends. My boyfriend saw us talking and got upset, so I told Bob I couldn‚Äôt talk to him anymore because of my boyfriend, and Bob understood. Later, my boyfriend would drop off food at my job, and Bob started talking to him as a friend. Eventually, they became friends, but I still didn‚Äôt talk to Bob because I didn‚Äôt want to cause problems with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend works at a coffee shop, and this girl, Erika, trained him. I sometimes waited for him outside work or stayed there doing homework, and I would see how close they were. They laughed together, had inside jokes, and seemed to have a really strong connection. I didn‚Äôt like it‚Äînot because she‚Äôs a girl, but because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have male friends at my job, so I felt like it wasn‚Äôt fair. I told him to stop talking to her, but he said he couldn‚Äôt because it would be awkward not to talk to her since they were coworkers, and he enjoys their conversations because they share the same sense of humor.

Over time, we fought about this, but he still refused to stop talking to her. He would sometimes mention how funny she was or how they defended each other from rude customers. But when we were out and someone was rude to me, he wouldn‚Äôt defend me; he‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not confrontational.‚Äù He always agreed with what Erika said, but if I disagreed with him, he‚Äôd argue with me, even if I was right. For example, if I said the world was flat, he‚Äôd argue and Google it to prove me wrong, but if Erika said the world was flat, he‚Äôd agree with her without question.

Erika also shared personal and traumatic experiences with him, and I felt like you have to be really close to someone to open up like that.

We took a break from each other, but not because of this issue. When we got back together, we agreed to keep it quiet, but one day I called him at work, and Erika saw his phone. She gave him a look of dissatisfaction and said oh you guys are back together, and he told me he couldn‚Äôt speak to me because she was right there. I asked him to tell her it was none of her business, but he refused, saying it would be mean and he wasn‚Äôt confrontational. I got really upset, called him repeatedly, and yelled at him to cut her off. Eventually, he asked what he should say, and I realized it wasn‚Äôt healthy to keep pushing him like that, especially since it seemed like he didn‚Äôt want to cut her off.

Recently, Erika got fired for stealing money from the cashier, and my boyfriend was really sad and worried if she would be able to pay rent. 

I need advice please help!!

Edit: sorry I am at work this is the other part 

There is also this other girl named Cynthia, whom he spoke to while we were on a break. He told me he never really liked her and found her annoying. But when were talking again before we made it official, they continued texting. I went through their messages, and they had long, fluid conversations that seemed fun. He also still had pictures of her on his phone and claimed he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to delete them. Also, when me and him made it official I told him to block Cynthia but he said he couldn‚Äôt because he works with her and it would be awkward but then he ended up blocking her more faster than Erika. There were just so many inconsistencies in what he would tell me. I feel like he only said he didn‚Äôt like her because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me, but yesterday we had a huge fight. Every time I bring it up, he gets so explosive and acts very suspicious.

(Also I called Cynthia a bitch and he defend her saying ‚ÄúCynthia is nicer than you‚Äù and he says he didn‚Äôt want me to talk shit, but I felt like he could have just said that instead of saying she is nicer than you)

So, like any girl would, I went for a tarot card reading, and it said that he would never take Erika seriously, but found her very attractive. With Cynthia, it said he didn‚Äôt like her appearance and hated her flaws, but he felt heard, special, and freer when he was with her, and he was happier with her.

I‚Äôve spoken to other men, but I was honest about it, blocked them, and never hung out with them. I only went on one date and ghosted him after. But when my boyfriend brings up my past, I talk to him and reassure him, while he can‚Äôt do the same for me because his actions say something completely different from what he tells me.",1,1732286678.0,Advice,30,0.53,False

1gx9cxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1gx9cxc/finally_finished_some_thoughts_after_a_550h/,Finally Finished... Some thoughts after a 550h playthrough,"To preface, I picked up EA probably somewhere around update 4. I played that for 100 hours or so. I think after update 6 I started a new save and played for another 100. I never really got past Aluminum in both cases. I struggled with the sudden increase in complexity back then.

With 1.0 I was determined to really give the game a full shake. This time, obviously, aluminum didn't deter me! I made it to the end producing 5/m Ballistic Warp Drives (among other things). Basically I didn't just make it to the end of the game, I fully automated everything and well over just the base level of automation. Here's a random set of thoughts after doing all that work.

In the past playthroughs I tried a megafactory and I just did not ever enjoy the process expanding it. I found the process tedious and not fun. So this time I decided I'd do satelite factories all over the map. This was far more approachable. Somewhere around Radio Control Units I started using the Wiki to determine how many items/m I'd need for my endgame plans. After lots of research and math I decided I'd make 5/m Ballistic Warp Drives, 5/m AI Expansion Servers, and 6/m Biochemical Sculptors. That determined everything else upstream. I also took future power generation into consideration but more on that later. Basically this method gave me a target for each factory and I'd never have to expand after that. Just how I like it! I'd just transport the products from one factory to the next until I reached the endgame stuff. Some of those targets felt pretty daunting, NGL. Superposition Oscillators at 60/m took a hot minute to set up! But it was super fun. 

Trains are goat. That is all.

Dimensional Depots are also goat. I'll never be able to play another crafting game where I have to run back and forth to some storage crate anymore. I like needing to have materials to build stuff but the reward for build progression with Depots was making building easier. A++ game design.

The community's reliance on the world grid is silly. Starting out that was one of the main tips I saw around here. It stressed me out during play until I gave up on it. Now my factories are scattered around the landscape organically and I love it. The world grid is \*not\* goat.

I was originally going to say I never found a need for battery automation. Fueling drones with whatever I had lying around worked out really well through Phase 4 because I usually had a little oil or fuel leftover I could use. Getting into Phase 5 though it suddenly just made sense to make a battery factory and supply the rest of my Phase 5 factories with batteries from it also delivered by drone.

Power generation seems really well balanced if you aren't into optimizing the fun out of the game. Let me explain. Each time I started to run low on power was pretty much right around when I'd unlock a new form of power generation. I never demolished old power plants. I just built a new one and I only ever built one of each type. Bio->Coal->Fuel->Turbo Fuel->Rocket Fuel->Ionized Fuel->Nuclear Uranium->Nuclear Plutonium/Ficsonium->Alien Power Matrix. I honestly loved how it progressed in complexity. I waited until I could make Plutonium fuel rods before I did nuclear so that I wouldn't have to deal with waste. I sunk those until I got my Singularity Cells up and running and then did a slight readjustment of my nuclear plant to burn those plutonium rods and turn the waste into Ficsonium. I know the community says that's not really worth it but it was fun and really all it amounted to for me was adding a couple particle accelerators, a couple quantum encoders, and a converter. I'll also add here that Rocket Fuel plants are overrated, IMO, and optimize the fun out of the game. Sure it's the most efficient but I found setting up fuel power plants to be super boring. Once you got the fuel in a pipe (and you don't need much for a ton of power), then all you do is setup literal fields of fuel plants and pipes. I got kinda tired of doing that. Nuclear was super fun. 10/10 highly recommend over more Rocket Fuel.

Alien Power Matrix is worth it just for the effects work on the Augmenter alone. I ended up with 3 Augmenters running at a consistent 30% boost rate. I like to sit and watch/listen to them.

Speaking of sound design, I feel like all the Phase 5 buildings went wild with cool sound design. I love the particle accelerators specifically.

My factories are mostly just big warehouses. I'm always impressed by the creative buildings shown here but while I experimented a few times with advanced building techniques like curves I ended up feeling like it wasn't worth the effort. But if you're the kind that makes fancy buildings, keep sharing. I'm super impressed at how much time and creativity that takes.

Overall 10/10 game. Amazing. After 550 hours playing in almost all my free time I suddenly don't know what to do with my life... Yes, Coffee Stain.. I have been playing for 10 hours today. Stop judging me with every auto save!

This is so alarming: 

Hi! I am a regular customer at your Mezza Strip branch. Something bad happened in this particular branch while I was having my go-to coffee. At around 6 pm (PLEASE review it on your CCTV for reference), a teenager went inside and distributed a paper at each table asking for cash donations. As the boy leaves the coffee shop, a Barista named ""JO"" with eyeglasses, a short guy, fit & has a musculin body built escorted him. But little did we know, he suddenly punched the kid in his face. The kid who was seemingly politely leaving the place was shocked by the sudden punch. As to the kid's surprise, He looked back at ""JO"" from the outside. This Barista ""JO"" wasn't done yet, he removed his eyeglasses, placed them on the table near the exit door then went to the kid, teasing for a fight. The kid remained shocked and helpless and just went away. 

As customers, we are so schocked also. This is a cafe, and this ""JO"" is working on a service industry. He should be respectful to any person coming in and out of the caf√©. If these people asking donations are not supposed to be coming in your shop, you should hire a security guard. Ang laki pa naman ng store niyo sa Mezza 1 with 2 doors pa.

I have watched them quite a few times. On my current watch-through I decided to use Netflix as it was a tad more convenient. I was intrigued when I started noticing some differences.

Example: s1e15, Game Night; when Barney starts telling his story we see him and Shannon in the coffee shop. Barney is singing a song and playing the keyboard. In the DVD release, Barney's voice over ends just as he sings the end of the song. On the Netflix cut the voice over ends right before he sings the last two lines of the song. I had no idea he was singing a Jewell song before this moment.

I was just going to have this watch through as background, but now I just gotta pay more attention to see if anything else is different.

Anyone else notice this?

P.S.: I did notice some new songs being played during certain scenes, like ""Soul Meets Body"" by Death Cab for Cutie and ""Spit On A Stranger"" by Pavement. Not sure why they were added.

1gx95zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gx95zt/differences_in_what_is_dating_dont_know_how_to/,Differences in what is dating. Don‚Äôt know how to compromise? M25 and F18,"This is a month worth of info so I understand if no one reads lol. 

Mind you this is my first relationship. It is a good age gap I know, but we worked together for a while now (almost a year). Keep in mind I'm a shy quiet guy and this is within a span of a month (timeline I'm going off memory). We started carpooling together since we work at the same place and go to college together. I liked her but I did not see her in a romantic way. These car rides turned into us chilling out enjoying each others presence. Sometimes it would be a deep conversation or it would be just listening to music. Eventually we start hanging out more at libraries in a one on one setting and this is after work.

I was in area working a different job setting up a party and tearing it down just decide to kill time at the place we both worked. They close for the day I'm with her she's asking what I'm going to while I wait for the party to be over. I tell her I'm goi g to the library and she tags along were bantering back and forth and she says ""I am going to miss you a lot when you leave college."" I was like ok I've never had anyone say that to me before and we've having been hanging out that long. I tell her ""we'll still hang out and we work together anyways."" Later that same day we decide to go out to eat she's really pushing for it and I go along. Everything is closed by the time we go out so I am driving around looking for a place and find a nice pizza joint. We go we're eating it's clear there's some sexual tension between us we're both struggling to make eye contact or just our usual banter. It's awkward. Bill comes (it's like $35) and she offers to pay her half (sort of adamant about it), but I feel obligated to pay because I feel like I took her out. We end up compromising I pay the bill she pays the tip we go our separate ways. Kinda come to the realization after that it felt like a date after, but I did not count it because I never asked her. Ride back to where her car is parked I'm still trying to kill time. She invites me back to her place and I was kinda shocked. I respectfully decline because I wouldn't go to a females place especially this early on or without her parents home because it's their house and I'm not trying to disrespect them. I end up just going back to the party and waiting there.

We hang out a lot on campus and she asks me to walk her to her class. In my head that's a couples thing to do or a move where your you want something like that. I agree thinking nothing too much about it. I'm opening every door for her and we're talking the whole time fun banter. Whenever time allows this becomes a thing I do for her. Even going as far to wait outside her classes for her. She asks me to teach her how to swim after talking about how she was trying to learn. I (stupidly) decline for scheduling reasons, I don't know how afraid she is of water (nervous about that and she wouldn't tell me), and the fact I wasn't as comfortable with my own body. Aslo felt like that was a romantic thing and didn't see her that way yet.

More carpooling, conversations, meetups (we're watching movies on laptops or listening to music now) and flirty banter later. I tell her about this art gallery I went to (I brought her back a coaster from it because she had dropped me off there - my way of saying thanks) and how I plan to go back I ask if she wants to join me and she agrees. We go after work and while walking over there conversing she brings up how if our coworkers saw us they'd think we're dating and she brings up our job's policy on dating. Tells me about how we might have to keep it a secret from our department or one of us leaves. She says she's leave cause she doesn't care about the job like that but enjoys the people there (she's been working there since high school - calls the coworkers family) Knowing all that I tell her not to worry about that I'd leave if it were to come to that because I only just got there and besides if I wanted to move up in the job I would have to leave anyway at some point. Once again in my head I'm thinking about the meaning of this. First time relationship I admittedly just to conclusions about if she trying to gauge my reaction to us possibly dating or maybe she feels like we are and is actually nervous about it. We get to the art gallery she tells me it's her first time and doesn't know what to do so I act as her tour guide basically explaining everything. I have the guide for the gallery because she doesn't understand and at some point she start leaning on me while I'm pointing stuff out on the guide. Once again in my head I am frozen cause I don't let women lean on me like this. I've hung out with female friends rarely one on one, but never had any get touchy feely with me. Only one who did had feelings for me so now I'm thinking it's the same thing. I'm enjoying but I create some space because I dont know for sure how either of us feel about each other. She's still really close. She comments how this is like a romantic hallmark movie the way the building is laid out. Not saying but I'm thinking that I guess we're the characters dating. Nice outing we go our separate ways. 

It feels like dating because I do all this and wouldn't do this with a female friend. I want to ask but I don't have the nerves and I don't want to push her into anything especially because she let me know she just got out of a relationship not to long ago. Fine by me I'm enjoying our time together and I'm not sure of my own feelings because of our age gap. 

More hangouts

Incident a work happens our young coworker does something very stupid (driving without a license) and the female I'm into tells me about it. Now that I know about it I just have to do the right thing even if it means being the ""bad guy"" in this situation. I'm visibly upset because everyone is gaslighting me talking about it's not a big deal but my female love interest told me she couldn't even park the car right in an empty parking lot. The whole time on shift I'm talking to her about how upset I am. I'm wracking my brain thinking up ways to help remedy this situation so our young coworker doesn't hurt herself or other behind the wheel. I keep waking away to talk to the young coworker and the F(18) is backing up 100% trying to ease my nerves too and helping think of solutions. Eventually we both get the young coworker to not get back in the car and have her parents drive her. I later send F(18) and hearty message just thanking her for having my back. She says no problem and she w as happy to help me. This whole thing made me for whatever reason thing of her for sure as a romantic interest. I'm no longer on the fence about that.

At the some point I start sending good morning messages with different words describing her everyday on the dot.

Some time after this I get swept up by my feelings I get her flowers, Lego ones she can build at her job because she wanted decorations, wanted something to do on break at work and didn't know what to put up. I made a whole day long scavenger hunt out of it for her to enjoy and she loved it.

We're trying to meetup but our college schedules are terrible for that. The only time either of us come out the house outside of college/work is to meet each other.  The car rides become our time to hang out and talk. She's letting me know more and more about her good and bad happening in her life. At this point I know she is the type of person that will only share something when she wants to share it (tried to ask her about her likes and dislikes - was like pulling teeth). 

She texts me (I'm at work) about school problems stressing her out to the point of tears. She's worried and I'm calming her down. When she gets to work I'm checking up on her whatever. I decide to just randomly take her on a walk to go get ice cream. Same thing I pay and she says a little about it but doesn't fight me for it like at the pizza spot. She does say after we leave that she feels like I'm paying for everything. I tell her I want to. Full clown mode I'm doing anything to make her smile and she's enjoying it. Thanks me for the good time and we part.

One of those car rides we talk for a while after work at this point I'm doing most the driving and I'm opening car doors for her whether it her car or mine. It's the usual, but then she starts leaning her on my arm while laughing at my jokes and she just kinda kept her head there and I am absolutely melting and she's touching my hand. My mind is going crazy because once again I never get touchy feely with my female friends I never did with her before we started hanging like this. I just let it happen. We part again. 

I'm going back in forth in my head adding up the past events whether or not I'm in a relationship with her. I never asked but we're doing things differently than we did as friends. I'm thinking it's just naturally happening. I want to ask but I'm nervous. To get around this I build up enough courage to start implying in texts that were in a relationship amd she never corrects me. At this point im thinking even though I never asked it's a relationship. 

More hangouts etc. I'm starting to get her coffee orders and we are sharing food. Meeting her best friend whatever. She's telling me about sexual things and plans for kids (I'm just like ok this is stuff you talk about with you significant other nothing usually). I'm think things are going well especially because she opening up to me.

Went out on a limb asked if she wanted to come over since it was my mother's birthday and we were throwing a party. For me it's important she gets along with my family and she did perfectly even bought my mother a gift (ice cream for her birthday cake amd she bought my cousins too) even though I told her she didn't have to.

Job trading day at work she writes a word in a different language on my arm and doesn't tell me what it means and is shy about all of it. I translate it and it says ""love"". I'm thinking this is her way of saying it because she doesn't like to open up like that. At that point all my back and forth about are dating are we not stops. I've had a past relationship ask me out in a similar fashion so I took it as the same.


At work because everything is hush hush with us. My female colleague are trying to set me up on dates all of a sudden. To which I nervously change the subject. I would tell them I have a gf but I don't want them the piece together it's F18. One goes as to say the new person we might hire is perfect for you. Now I'm freaking out and I bring this to F18 and her response was ""I think you should."" That just like shatters me because I'm the type of person to only talk to one girl at a time and 
F18 is suggesting I talk to someone else after I've been doing all this for a whole month? 

Of course I'm not pleased and I thought I made her mad by asking that initial question but she didn't seem upset at all. Drive back no problem and we were making plans to meet up. I am comfortable enough to bring it again that night because I am actually worried about messing with the news girls feelings etc. and she says, ""I genuinely think you should try."" At this point im upset because I already told her I'm not that type of guy to talk to multiple women at the same time and I've said so even before we started dating. We leave it there.

She says the same thing the next morning. I honestly pissed cause she keep saying it without explaining anything. Eventually we talk about it. That's when everything change.

We both think differently about dating. I thought it was everything above especially the bit about writing ""love"" on me. I don't use that word lightly. Apparently to her everything above was just getting to know you and dating is knowing her favorite color, music, makeup routine, hanging out more, texting more, more phone calls and sex. All of which I've either tried to learn or try to cram into our busy schedules (except for sex for me that only happens after the ring - we knew we differed on that though). So now we're on the same page but not at the same time. 

I'm hurt sure but in fairness I never asked what we were. She says she's not trying to rush another relationship and that we are in just talking/getting to know you. Though to me that's what dating is getting to know one another. Now we are in a weird place. 

Until we figure out what dating is between us a lot of what I've been doing has to get walked back because it was coming from a place of love and testing our relationship as if we were dating.

Hey all. I need some more HR heads on this to make sure I‚Äôm handing it well. 

I just started a new job as a Senior HRBP for a company who just got a new CEO and acquired several other companies in 2024, with plans to do more in 2025. I was hired by the HR manager who explained to me I‚Äôll be working out of one of the newly acquired offices where there‚Äôs one other HR lady (let‚Äôs call her Amy), and he wanted me to bridge corporate and Amy‚Äôs local office as the company is working to integrate all newly acquired companies. He explained to me I‚Äôm coming in as the senior HR person and expected to do more high level work while coaching Amy since her experience was mostly clerical HR stuff. Amy would eventually start to report to me as well. So far so good, it sounded amazing. 

Fast forward to starting, the manager who interviewed me had quit and a new one had started the week before me. She (let‚Äôs call her Kate) is great, but herself new at things. 

Here starts the issue. On the first day there was a hands all meeting with Amy, Kate, the VP of HR and several other HR people from other offices. We all introduced ourselves and I spelled out my title vs just saying the letters in my intro. Amy was next, and said her title was whatever I said, that hers is the same. It was kinda weird how dismissive she was of it, and also it wasn‚Äôt my impression that we are on the same level. Ok, no biggie. Then on Tuesday I work from the office for the time, and as I arrive I see Amy frantically moving her stuff from one office to another. Her old office was basically a front desk with a glass slider window looking at the hallway that doesn‚Äôt lock, a narrow countertop installed against it, and a bunch of filing cabinets all over. The one she was moving into was a proper office with 4 walls. She told me the front desk area will be my office and laughed that I‚Äôd have to sit with all the coffee stains she made when she spilled on the carpet, apparently multiple times. 

This is not acceptable for many reasons - this is not a real desk, people walking by me are very distracting, there‚Äôs zero noise insulation, people literally talk to me through the window without a need to open it, and people keep walking in to grab stuff from the cabinets, with my screens facing the door and the entire office inside. There‚Äôs no privacy whatsoever. 

To top off Amy making me sit in a clearly inferior space to hers, she keeps introducing me to people as the new HR admin, and when Amy wasn‚Äôt around yesterday someone said they are very happy she‚Äôs training her replacement so Amy can finally take over Dawns old position (HR manager who retired after the acquisition). 

This is completely backwards as far I understand. But no one from corporate is here and I have a hard time correcting her since I still have no access to any systems and can‚Äôt even check her actual title. 

Yesterday I emailed Kate and explained why this space is not acceptable for sensitive HR work and I‚Äôd like to be moved. She responded very positively, but when I started inquiring in my office for options it was met with the receptionists opinion that it makes more sense for me to sit where I am. 

Do you see the issue? I‚Äôm hired by corporate to do HR strategic work, but locally I‚Äôm treated as an HR clerk who needs to keep quiet and start filing paperwork. I don‚Äôt know how to speak up without making it seem like I‚Äôm tooting my horn. I have never had to reassert my position at work because it has generally been known who I am, but now I‚Äôm an outsider to the office and the insider (Amy) is feeding them whatever info she likes. 

I‚Äôd like to take steps to address it myself first before asking corporate for help and I‚Äôm not sure how to proceed. I have no problem being assertive but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs the way to get the local office to work with me, as they are already weary of the big wigs that acquired them. 

Ps: my husband challenged me whether I could have misunderstood my own role, and I highly doubt that‚Äôs the case. I was offered 20k higher than the advertised top range of the salary, and I‚Äôm paid VERY well for my area. No one pays an hr admin the salary I was offered. 

Any help by the seasoned hr folk would be amazing right now, thank you for reading all that! 

TLDR: I was hired for a senior HRBP strategic role, but in my local office the other HR lady is consistently underplaying my role, sat me down in what‚Äôs hardly an office, introduces me as an admin and has told people I‚Äôm there to replace her while she‚Äôs taking over the manager role. I need help on addressing it without flexing, I‚Äôm not here to flex but at this point I‚Äôm getting straight steamrolled. ",2,1732285532.0,humanresources,3,1.0,False

Half of you think you're pretty because some chocolate-faced baboon with a squiggly smile and broccoli hair sent you a dirty DM on social media, while the other half still has a mustache which rivals teenage boys and a unibrow which would put Homo Neanderthals to shame.

You put up pictures of your own self on anonymous platforms, then ask for help on the same platforms when you get random weird DMs from strangers who got lured by your profile pictures.

OnlyFans is your safe haven too. Nobody likes to take your hairy ass seriously because of y'all doing these things.

All hell breaks loose when someone DMs one of you girls. ""Oh no, a weird DM from a stranger?! This is the story of how I get harassed online!

I'll make a post on every social media platform telling others that there is still hope to find love online!"". You are not obligated to reply to every weirdo who DMs you, Miss Village.

God forbid one of you gets ghosted. It becomes a state of emergency when that happens. There's always that group of five morbidly obese women and seventeen niceguys‚Ñ¢ defending her. And anyone who disagrees is automatically an ""incel"". Why? Because they disagreed with her. ""NO! YOU DISAGREE WITH A WOMAN? HOW DARE YOU? YOU'LL DIE ALONE WITH THAT ATTITUDE, MISTER!""

What the fuck is this obsession with food? I get eating out, but goddamn you whales even have the audacity to ask random guys you match with on dating apps to bring you food. Which brings me to the act of begging for money from strangers - were you waterboarded as a child? Because you should be put through that again, honestly.

You blame guys for being unoriginal with their ""pick-up lines"" and whine about wanting someone genuine, but have you taken a good look in the mirror? Your own profiles are filled with the same, boring bullshit. Literally all of you have a prompt or two about liking dogs, food, coffee, long drives, and/or humour. Everyone likes those things you wet sausage. And if it's not that, it's something edgy and borderline nasty. ""One thing i'll never do again is suck my stepdad's dick"" bitch you live in an Indian household. You didn't willingly suck his dick, he probably made you. You folks are just as dry, if not drier, in conversations with the very men you call dry. No, you're not a ""baddie"" - especially if you call yourself a one.

1gx8yer,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1gx8yer/am_i_overthinking_things_in_this_friendship/,Am I overthinking things in this friendship? ,"Im in a tricky situation where a friend (23F) and I (25M) have strong chemistry but know there is unlikely to be longevity in a relationship. There is a TLDR at the bottom but for those interested, the story is as follows:

A few months ago I moved to a newly opened gym and started to get along really well with one of the staff members. 

After ~3 weeks of me going to this gym, the staff member and I had started to develop somewhat of a friendship. This mainly included having brief chats everytime we saw each other at the gym, her giving me the occasional free coffee, and exercising together a couple times (both happened to be there at the same time). By this point I was convinced there was some chemistry between us that I couldn't help but wanting to explore. 

On one particular afternoon, I went to the gym in the afternoon to pick up a water bottle I had left the night before (we had spoken / exercised together that previous night). To my surprise she was there again at the gym exercising, where she mentioned she'd be working till late that night. 

After retrieving my bottle and leaving the gym, I went home, had dinner, put on my exercise clothes and went back to the gym, with only one purpose - ask out this girl and get her number.

I walk into the gym where she immediately sees me whilst being occupied with a customer. I thought oh shit my plan has failed and started chatting to another friend in the gym to keep my cool. Next minute she comes up to me asking why I am back and I said ""I'm here to ask you out for a drink"". She said yes and gave me her number. 

Fast forward a couple weeks, we had gone out with some of her friends but not quite got a drink 1 on 1. The first night I went out with her friends it was pretty strange and not at all what I had hoped for. 

The next week we spoke about the night and came to terms that it's probably best we stay friends. The main rationale was that she didn't want anything to happen that might make her new job at the gym weird or awkward. We both agreed that we really enjoyed spending time with each other and that a friendship would be valuable 

Fast forward another few weeks and we were catching up more frequently outside the gym and texting daily (sending lots of memes to each other). At this point I could feel my intentions for a friendship being heavily challenged so I let her know I needed to take a step back in the friendship to gather my bearings again. 

We didn't speak for almost a week, apart from briefly bumping into each other a couple times at the gym. Through this short period I thought I had come to terms with us never developing anything more than a close friendship. This was due to us having differing religious beliefs, albeit having very similar outlooks on life, especially towards relationships.  

We began messaging again pretty consistently and during this week alone went out for dinner and were at gym together multiple times. Yesterday we both had the day off so decided it would be nice to head outdoors for a day trip. We ended up spending ~ 12 hours in each other's company where we finished the day off with a few beers at a pub. Throughout a lot of the day we spoke more about how our values align yet acknowledged our differing religious outlooks. Neither of us greatly observse out respective religions, yet feel they are part of our identities (Im Jewish and she is Christian). 

We laughed a bunch, overcame challenges, had great conversation all day together and I now I'm convinced there is mutual attraction/ interest in something more than just a friendship. The trajectory of our friendship is following a similar trend to how most of my past relationships have started (organically meet > start hanging out a bunch > start becoming physically intimate) 

I'm at a bit of a cross roads, on the one side I'm still not 100% sure if she is just enjoying the friendship for what it is. On the other side, the more we hang out, the more the chemistry between us grows. I think we are both hesitant to take the friendship any further based on the  conflict of religious interest, but I don't know how to digest my current emotions towards her. 

TL;DR, I met a staff member at a new gym and asked her out. After hanging out a bit we agreed to be friends due to her new job and a conflict of religious interests. We started hanging out a bunch more and realised we have very similar outlooks on life, especially towards relationships. Today we spent ~12 hours together and I am feeling the chemistry is now too good where I don't know how to digest the situation any more.

Is she leading me on? If not, how might I go about suggesting we try develop our relationship further? If she is just enjoying our friendship, is it wise of me to invest more time and energy? Please give me your most constructive advice!

My baby was very sick when he was born (sepsis) so I'm probably overcautious with what he comes into contact with; I wipe down any toys in classes before allowing him to have them, family and friends are to sanitise/wash hands before handling babe etc. I don't know what to do. I'm so heartbroken! I'll see her tomorrow for one of the classes we attend and I feel like I won't want to go near her at all. She's such a lovely girl and we get on so well, I would hate to upset her if I distance myself. I just don't know what to do. ",9,1732285221.0,UKParenting,23,0.7,False

Earlier this week I found out I have to go in on Monday for a breast biopsy. They were supposed to go home Sunday. My husband asked her not to leave on Sunday as planned so there's someone with him in case PT  comes that day. My husband asked FIL to drive me there and wait in the coffee shop until I am done. I'm okay with that so my husband isn't worrying about me and am okay with the fact that they know. 

MIL, who is a breast cancer survivor, offered to come with me but I shut that down because she'll turn me into a nervous wreck and make it all about her. My godchild who is also a breast cancer survivor offerred to meet me there (she works nearby), so I told her yes, because she's gone through it recently and she's a calming influence.

This morning she was talking that they would be leaving early Tuesday morning because "" he (meaning my FIL) might be tired from the day before. What went through my head was he's going to be tired, he's not the one getting his breast biopsied! So all I said was well, ""if he's too tired you can leave Monday afternoon after my appointment in the morning. She then backtracked and said it might be too dark for them to drive home.",24,1732284987.0,JUSTNOMIL,3,0.93,False

I just finished week 1 (kit 4) and have lost 2lbs! I honestly didn't think I would lose that much so I'm very happy. I feel less bloated, have more energy and all around just feel better!  Here are some things I have learned this past week.

1. I can't eat nuts on the kit. I tried walnuts and pecans for a snack and they really messed up my stomach. I had cramps for several hours afterwards and just felt terrible.

2. I have to eat with my medicine (I knew that already but still sharing). I tried one day to not eat with it and I felt off all day. I am up around 630, have coffee, load up on water, take my medicine at 9-930 with an english muffin. If I get hungry/snacky around 130-200 - I eat some veggies/soup/protein - something. Then we have dinner around 5. I am in bed around 8. I start getting snacky around 7 (need suggestions)

3. WATER WATER WATER. I can't stress how important water is. I immediately notice when I don't drink enough water - I get sluggish, headaches and constipation..



\*\* NEED SUGGESTIONS\*\*

 I have a habit of unhealthy snacking at night. I want crunchy and sweet. I'm going to see if I can get some dried fruit, maybe get some cucumbers, grapes, apples or something HEALTHY. Does anyone have any suggestions on healthy snacks I can have at night or even during the day if I get hungry. I have tons of energy but when looking at what I eat, sometimes I feel it's not enough.

I genuienly can't do this shit. Mother already told me im selfish, worthless, I've been her pain since this whole year and many more fucking things. I cant do this. I'm just fourteen. How the fuck do I find help when i already told her to get psychologist but she refused. How the fuck am i meant to live with this narcissist whose whole life is just degrading me. I guess its some sort of kink or fetish..
 I don't want to tell my full lifestory since this is just to get my feelings out and maybe a help hand who just tells me how to fucking overdose but I'll sum it up. It started back when i was younger, i was sensitive and still am and my mom was narcissistic (still is) and my dads drunk (nd still is). They are apart but thats better since when they're together they just yell at eachother (since i was young) my mom is the more agressive type. Anyway i stopped eating normally when i was 8-9 at school, my mom told me not long ago that i should suck my stomach up (im average, i was chubby. Now im thinner and thinner).Then began velbar (if im spelling it right) abuse and sometimes slap but that was like rare (one time for forgetting a card, tf) anyway then at the ripe age of 10 i started to starve almost, living off of small proportions of food and energy drinks (2 a day and an ice coffee, also im diabetic and have an illness so i gotta take meds, i stopped taking them too. } this was all in summer, 2020/21) It continued till I was .. 12? at the time i used to have really bad panic attacks, full on yet being quiet since no one could help me. I was twelve. Then became hypersexual (which came back again as I had internet and uhh hypersexualisation started when i was... 7?). Anyway i wanted to kill myself bad, i sh but not in cutting myself but other ways.} as in restricting myself from breathing etc. Well uhh I didn't wash, i think it may have been depression but not sure. I didn't care about my hygiene and just straight up didn't wash for 2 months or 3 idk. Which seems like not alot but it continued when i got home etc etc. After that It was hard for me to brush my teeth, and shower as said. My mom became manipulating me and verbally abusing me, which sounds soft but it really gets to a 7 year old deep in heart. (ik i said i was 12 by that point but i still was a child.) She made fun of me infront of others just to make them laugh, revealed my secrets, manipulated me by the things I told her when I was venting (true mistake). Then when i was 13 I almost attempted- Bullying was harder, low self esteem, fighting with strangers online, was mean, yet wanted to be just fucking loved. Anyway the attempt happened when i was outside with my ex (eww cornyyy), i suddenly left and quickly went to a train station where i cried my heart out, i was swinging my feet along the tracks but i chickened out.. I tried calling linka bezpeci {a help line} but they didn't answer. The time I needed them the most. Anyway I almost killed myself when My teacher told me I failed class, and now im failing again. Im so thinking of overdosing. (this just sums up my life and i know it doesnt sound like much but i didnt mention how verbally abusing my mom was, how often, how tiring it was, how degrading my teachers were, my identity being revealed, my friend almost killing herself twice, seeing scars on her neck. My mom using me as a gag (as in making fun of my problems, her snooping thru my priv chats without knowing where my full life was), getting bullied in school, getting bullied at home, getting bullied at my grandmas just to have her take her anger out and then just waiting for my dad to overdose on alcohol and seeing him not eat properly... Look. I'm just a child, i know I'm 14 but I still haven't figured out even who I am. I GENUINELY am trying but.. I can't fucking do this. I'm gonna go to psychologist if I dont kms on monday (if shes even there). Now. Is this depression or am I just sensitive. Because I'm genuinely so ready to take the pills and end up like my friend in fhe hospital. I just want ms mother feel guilt.. I'm just fourteen. What did I do to deserve this. Im A Teen. 14. A child. a child. Kms . Anyway I may be done crying now, buhbye,have a good day, and sorry if i ruined yours.",1,1732284940.0,depression,0,0.99,False

We can't even make coffee or tea anymore due to how awful the tap water is. Very chemically, tons of chlorine. 

I'm a little worried it's something to do with my house specifically but because of the chemically taste I'm not exactly sure. 

Are others also experiencing this? I'm over by McLeod and Kalar
