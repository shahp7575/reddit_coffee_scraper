I bought a couple buckets from firehouse subs, hardwood pellets, mushroom liquid culture, free starbucks coffee grounds, and sterilized packaged rice.

To begin, I want to try growing them on my own. Once i’ve made a few successful flushes, i’ll reach out to farmers markets.

I’m Abhijit, a tech enthusiast from Pune, India 🇮🇳

Lately, I’ve noticed something many of you might relate to — **loneliness in big cities.** Whether you're in a place like Pune, Bangalore, or Mumbai, people often move to urban areas for jobs, education, or opportunities. But despite being surrounded by crowds, many feel disconnected.

It hit me that **so many of us, despite differences in age, background, or profession, actually share similar interests** — whether it’s music, books, gaming, food, photography, or late-night chai walks. Yet we rarely find ways to connect beyond the usual social media or dating apps.

So here's my **startup idea**:

>

Think of it like a blend of:

* [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) (but lighter and more personal)
* Reddit (but location-based)
* Not a dating app — just **interest-based human connection**

**Use cases:**

* New to the city? Find people who like trekking, coding, or stand-up comedy.
* Want to start a book club or a music jam group? Post your idea and find others nearby.
* Just want someone to co-work or grab coffee with who shares your vibe? You’ll find them.

I believe that **connection should start from shared passion, not profile pictures.**

I’m still early in building this — wireframes, ideas, validation. Would love to hear:

* What do you think of this idea?
* Would you use something like this?
* What features do you think are essential?
* Know any devs/designers who’d want to help build it?

Feel free to drop thoughts or DM if you’re interested in chatting more 🙌

Cheers,

1lr5qqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1lr5qqi/gear_considerations_tmb_and_beyond/,Gear considerations: TMB and beyond,"Hi, I've been doing a lot of research over the past two weeks but have a hard time deciding to go and actually spend the money on the choices that have ended up in the more narrow selection. I was hoping that some members with more experience could help shed some light on my questions/proposed pack. I apologize for the wall of text but I would really like to get my thoughts across so people know what choices I had in mind before commenting. If you took the time to look over this, thank you!

**In particular I am interested in which items would be the most worthwhile in terms of investing money in early on.** We all know that you can get to 10lbs BW by just buying a bunch of expensive gear. I am happy to invest in gear that truly holds its merit in a variety of situations, but don't want to overspend on things I might not really have a use for this summer. I am also not a fan of consumerism/gear fetishism so I am trying to see what MYOG options are viable. I was inspired by a lighterpack linked [here](https://lighterpack.com/r/6hpkqk).

**I am majorly constrained by being 200cm (6""7') and located in Europe**, so a lot of US cottage makers and certain items are not available to me (also nothing on the used market). This has informed most of my lighterpack, but I could totally have missed places to get fitting gear and am happy to receive advice on where to find it.

**Location**: This summer I was looking at doing the TMB (late August) due to the coverage and infrastructure. I am quite an anxious person and this environment would allow me to have a challenge by offering wildcamping possibilities without being far from food or a campsite if it gets too much. Extremely relaxed 11 day estimate because I got a knee injury in my last hike a year ago and am scared of overdoing it with the amount of descents. I would like to do other, longer hikes around Europe (Norway, Sweden, UK, GR11 etc), but they are sometimes more remote and I am anxious about the food/resupply situation since I don't have any experience with camping food, hence the TMB. I will do a smaller 3 day trip with the gear before it as well to make sure it works out for me. Alternatively I will do an 8 day trip with lighter conditions (Luxembourg, Belgium) in which case I really don't want to spend a lot of money.

**Goal Baseweight (BPW):** I think 5kg is still somewhat acceptable if cheap (I am forced to carry more weight due to sleeping system and tent needing to be bigger), but anything north of 6kg (13lb 4oz) is just not it. I am 84kg right now (185lbs), so in an ideal world my loaded pack would not even break 10% of my bodyweight most of the time. I included some of my existing gear, which, while not perfect, is ""free"". **This is not a formal shakedown request**, I unfortunately have to give manufacturing data and some estimates on gear - let's not get hung up about stuff sacks just yet, this is about the bigger picture for now.

**Budget:** I'd like to minimize this first purchase down towards 1500€ in the smartest manner. In the future I am happy to buy more gear, and I could spend more (up to 2000€) if it really is a good, long-lasting purchase. Most of the budget is tied up in the Big 4, which leads to an optimization problem of which clothes to invest in.

______________________________________

https://lighterpack.com/r/w785v4

**Tent**: I don't think I can get around an X-Mid 2p here. Going by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1kqo32h/whats_a_7_footer_suppost_to_do/mt771x8/) comment, it should fit me. Going Pro becomes a lot more expensive, that money is better invested elsewhere for now. Since I'd have to luck out with being allowed to take poles on the plane, I might just pick some up in Charmonix for about 50€.

**Sleep System**: Finding a quilt is the bane of my existence and my main struggle. Right now I am looking at a Hyberg Loner 450 XL (could probably lose the compression sack for -36g). To get Cumulus to make something in my size is a custom job and a lot more expensive. I have also received a quote from Khibu but it is more expensive with less downfill and probably not here in time. Katabatic quilts are just a tad too small. I think it would also be easier to just return my quilt to Hyberg if it doesn't work out for me. Temps above 2500m hit -5C in the night (a friend who did the TMB warned me of this), so I am also considering bringing a silk sleeping bag liner I already have - I think the ~100g for it are a fair insurance to calm my anxiety about that.

For the sleeping mat I have mainly considered two options. The Big Agnes Rapide SL Insulated Long and Thermarest NeoAir XLite NXT MAX Large. The Rapide SL is just way cheaper (100 Euros), I hope that the lack of width still allows me to sleep well enough. Amok Fjol UL XL is 815g so passing on that for now. 

Not considering a pillow at the moment because I probably need to use my backpack anyway to make up for the sleeping mat being too short.

**Backpack**: Right now I have an Osprey Stratos 44, which obviously.. not good. I initially considered just going through with it to minimize expenses, but I think a better backpack would actually end up making a huge difference. I can't reach my water easily, nor snacks with the old one. Totally down to try frameless backpacks. I like the design of the Pa'lante packs, but they are almost bulky for frameless from what I read, and difficult to get over here (but I found one place that has some V2 stock left, even though the extra space of the desert pack would be nice). Hyberg also has some lighter packs with similar design (the food pocket at the bottom of the bag). UL framed packs are appealing, but way more expensive. If we're talking about packing your fears, I would totally pack too much food and limiting the size helps prevent that (hoping that I can still somehow fit 5 days of food for the remote hikes). This is the area I have done less research on, I wanted to get everything else sorted first. I would like to try to MYOG one at some point, but it is too early to risk this for now I believe.

**Clothes**: Rain gear: The Montbell Versalite is very appealing after reading all the testimony. I am in the camp of either shelling out for it or going cheap with Frog Toggs UL2. I know that if I do the Mammut hike in Norway (my idea for next year), I will probably want to upgrade to it anyway, so buying a rain jacket for 70-150€ will just result in me spending even more money and ending up with two jackets. Unfortunately, one way to calm my anxiety is buying the best gear :( Not sure about pants if I do that, I like the idea of rain skirts and that's a viable MYOG project to achieve beforehand. I like the idea of an umbrella since it protects against the sun too, someone I met while hiking in Spain was very happy with his.

Sun hoody: well, there's a bunch of expensive merino options. I'd love to fit that into the budget because I really like merino stuff, unfortunately the cheap options often recommended here seem to be US only. Could not find something in stock at Decathlon, that's where I'm planning to get my base layer.

Pants: I was fine with just sunscreen in Spain, hoping that continues.

Fleece: I have found 2 Alpha Direct options for Europe - [Skalmo](https://backpackinglight.dk/clothing/skalmo-alpha-hoodie) and [Nahleko](https://www.nalehko.cz/panska-mikina-nalehko-alpha-hoody-120/). The latter is cheaper but unfortunately doesn't have the 90gsm option. I am unsure which gsm to aim for, wondering if 60 is too cold or 120 too warm. Cheap option would be non-breathable fleece from Decathlon for 300g+ (but I'd like something better than that).

Down Jacket: I was thinking that I might not need one for this trip. I will get one in the future for Norway for sure, but I think a combo of Versalite + AD should keep me warm enough, and I have the quilt at camp. If I end up staying in a town it should not get that cold. Possible cheap option is Decathlon again, but already quite expensive and heavy. I am not looking forward to a possible scenario of days of rain and me in my Frog Toggs + cheap fleece.

**Cooking Stuff**: BRS3000 and Toaks 750 require no explanation I think. Katadyn BeFree would be slightly lighter according to manufacturer specs, but multiple people prefer some functions of the QuickDraw. There's a stretch of the TMB that has no water supply so I might take a 2L pouch with me, otherwise just PET bottles. I was thinking of a mug, but I don't drink coffee in the mornings and would like to cold soak anyway. Might make a hot chocolate or something, but why buy things you probably don't need. Cold soak container, spork still has to be figured out but I still see this as a minute detail.

**Electronics**: Wish I could get the Haribo powerbank in Europe. Happy with the headlight price, but not so much with the powerbank. Maybe I can just lend some stuff from a friend and save myself the 70€.",1,1751590317.0,Ultralight,0,1.0,False

I was secretly living in this old woman’s house. I was basically hiding out there, sneaking around while she was asleep. One night I decided I needed to get out, so I slept in my outdoor clothes to be ready. While tying my shoes, I heard her wake up and start running. I panicked and ran too, but she saw me.

And then, instead of being mad, she just said in a completely normal voice, “Wait, where are you going? I was going to give you a medal.”

I just blinked at her like, ""What do you mean, a medal?""

Turns out, she knew I was there the whole time.

The house had two sections in the same building. Downstairs was old and cozy, very antique-Victorian with stained glass and vintage furniture. Upstairs was this weirdly clean, modern kitchen space that felt more like an office or salon, where she took clients.

I didn’t even get there by walking. I was on my computer, looking at a virtual tour on her website (like Google Street View inside the building), and when I clicked the “look around” feature, I somehow teleported into the actual space.

In the kitchen there were three big jars:

* One labeled “coffee grounds” (they were used grounds, which confused me)
* One labeled but I couldn’t read it (it was white powder)
* One unlabeled, full of light brown powder

I tasted the brown one, thinking it might be like Nesquik, but it had no taste at all.

Also (side plot): I confessed my love to one of my lesbian friends, but I did it through a horribly edited picture that had emoji matrices in it, basically like a math grid but with emojis instead of numbers. Her matrix was full of sad emojis, and I wrote something like “UWU DON’T BE SORRY I LOVE YOU!!!” It was both embarrassing and devastating.

Back to the old woman: When she caught me and said she was giving me a medal, I just stood there, frozen, fully bracing for her to yell at me or kick me out. But instead, I saw her face flash into my mom’s face for a split second, and then I woke up.

I think everyone knows the basic advice by now, so these are some tips that i know will help.

1. Prove You're the Fix

spot a clear issue at a company you like (e.g., old website, quiet social media). Then, email the department head directly. Don't ask for a job yet! Instead, say, ""I noticed X problem. I've solved similar things (with Y result) and think I can help you too."" You're showing them you're a solution, not just an applicant.

2. Close the Tab

For certain jobs, especially at smaller, local businesses (neighborhood coffee shop or a small store), don't just apply online. Instead, print out your CV, look neat, and walk in during a quiet time. Then, politely ask if you can talk to the manager. actually, makes you standout. helps you get past computers and lets you meet a real person face to face, which often makes a much STRONGER impression.

3.

try to niche down as much as possible

avoid applying to 200 jobs a week. literally just a waste of energy. Instead, pick just 3-5 jobs you genuinely want each week. Then, make your CV and a brief cover letter absolutely perfect for each one, really highlighting what they need. Quality applications beat quantity almost every single time.

4. Be a Person

Everyone says ""network,"" but what does that even mean? It means talk to people. Reach out to folks on social media who have jobs you'd love. Ask for 15-20 minutes of their time not to beg for a job, but to genuinely learn about their career, their company, or industry challenges. Build a real connection. If you impress them, they'll often offer to keep you in mind or introduce you to someone. This is how many hidden jobs get filled, through genuine connections.

It’s definitely rough right now, but if you keep putting in genuine effort, it will be unreasonable not to break through. Good luck you’ve got this!",0,1751589993.0,jobsearchhacks,0,0.5,False

FRANK A. HINE, OF CLEVELAND, OHIO, ASSIGNOR OF ONE-HALF HIS RIGHT TO JOHN A. WORLEY, OF SAME PLACE.
IMPROVEMENT IN CULINARY STEAIVIERS.
Specication forming part of Letters Patent No. 128,396, dated June 25, 1872.
Specification describing an Improvement in the Combination of a Vegetable-Steamer with a Tea-Kettle, invented by FRANK A. HINE, of Cleveland, in the county of Cuyahoga and State of Ohio.
This invention relates to the construction and arrangement of a steamer for cooking vegetables and a tea-kettle in such a manner that the steamer may be set on the kettle and receive the steam therefrom; the water in said kettle being also used for making tea, coffee, and such other purposes for which hot Water is required; the object being to utilize the steam generated 'in the kettle, which in the ordinary use is allowed to escape. This improvement isv applicable to all common cook or heating stoves.
The following is a description of its construction and operation:
Referring to the drawing, Figure lis an eX- terior view, and Fig. 2 is a vertical half section of my above-mentioned improvement.
A represents a circular vessel, made in the form of a tea-kettle, having a tight fiat top, and is provided with a pit for setting in a hole on the stove. At one side, near the top, is attached a filling-pipe, B, and below, near the rim of the pit, is attached a faucet, C, for the double purpose of indicating the height of the water in the kettle and for drawing oii' water. In the top of the kettle, either in the center or at one side, is a small pipe, D, intended for conducting the steam generated in the kettle to an upper compartment or vessel. E is a steamer,l which consists of a metal can, having a fiat top and Without a bottom, which sits in the rim of a base, F, that sits on the kettle. Said base has a pipe, D', fitting over the pipe D. To the base F is also attached a rack, G, for holding pans for containing vegetables or other articles of food to be cooked.
The rack consists of a series of iiat bars, H H, crossing at the center and secured together, the ends, except at one side, being attached to upright posts I I, giving the rack strength to support the pans.
The steamer may be made by inverting the can E, and having a cover, the rack being loose and slipped down in; but the plan shown is preferable, as no steam can escape at the top, and the base-pan F catches all the conu densed steam. The steamer E may have a small pipe at the top so that a second steamer may be placed on it, and thus increase the capacity of the invention.
Having described my invention, I claim- The kettle A, provided With a iilling-pipe, B, and faucet O, and the steamer E, base F, rack Gr, and steam-induction pipe D, When the same Vare constructed, combined, arranged, and opera-ting substantially as shown and def scribed, and for the purpose set forth.

(Please check my previous post for the right format, I figured I can’t include the poem as an attachment now… )

Grief is a blank page the pen fears.

Left open for years,

It fights to be inked,

begs to be looked at.


We pretend to not hear its breath, but ultimately, it is our only friend.

We stain it with coffee rings and salt. The residues of our nights.


The living write to keep their legacy alive, scrawling their names into time.

The Act of Creation is a celebration.

But there is nothing worth recording from grief.

The defeated do not write. The defeated lose the urge to immortalize.


So, the page is left blank.

It silences us.

It imposes its power and does not fear us.

Yet, we have the power of turning it, we have the power to tear it.

But it knows we are too weak to do it.

It knows that the only thing that keeps us breathing,
is looking at it every morning, is... 

not moving on

renting inches of our souls to store old memories.

Our hands tremble at the thought of ripping history.



Grievers live in the past, stuck in that scaffolding.

The past is a prison. No bars, just a mirror.

And in it, your face - the face of the warden.

Hi! I’m alternative and a lil witchy, like the kind of person who owns too many black clothes and a tarot deck. I have  a love for all things spooky, magical, and slightly off the beaten path... I’m into horror, sci-fi, fantasy, if it’s weird, dark, or makes you question reality—I’m in.

I love food, good coffee that could fuel a small spaceship, and speakeasies where I can pretend I’m mysterious and not just bad at small talk. Outdoorsy but in a “cabin in the woods, but not the murdery kind” way—I hike, kayak, and sometimes even camp without complaining (much).

Musically I’m all over the place, but 00s emo has a permanent room in my soul. Yes, I still know all the words to every The Used album. No, I’m not sorry.
Looking for new friends to swap memes, movie recs, playlists, and maybe curse recipes with. Clean chats, fun vibes, no weird energy unless it’s astrological.

1lr5emg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lr5emg/confess/,Confess.,"“When the reaper comes for you, don’t be afraid.”

The words of my mother echoed through my head, my heart, my confusion.

They were the last words she said to me before she died.

My mother, my favorite person in the world, my last living family member. Gone.

I had tucked her into sleep that night, she had been getting older and less sure of herself. But she was still there, she just had her bad moments.

I had left her with a glass of water and crackers on her nightstand, held her hand and smiled as I told her to sleep well.

That’s when her grip tightened, just slightly, as her eyes looked at me with love and devotion. That’s when she uttered the words.

“When the reaper comes for you, don’t be afraid.”, She calmly told me.

I nodded at her, feeling the familiar helpless feeling that always peered at me when she spoke like this.

“Okay Mom, I won’t.”, I said quietly. 

I kissed her hand, and left her bedside, she was asleep before I even shut the lights off.

The next morning, she was found on the rocks below the cliffside about a mile from our home. 

She didn’t leave a note, nothing to explain her rash decision. She was just.. gone. 

When I cleaned her room that evening, I looked for clues. Something, anything, to get a look into her state of mind. The only thing I found was her journal, and I would never invade her privacy.

I ate dinner alone.

I washed the dishes alone.

I sat on the couch, ready to turn on our favorite show, when I paused.

I can never watch that show again.

Since the moment the officers knocked on my door this morning with the news, I haven’t cried once.

I’ve wanted to. I’ve wanted to scream, cry, throw things against the wall. 

But I can’t.

It’s like I’ve shut down.

I picture my phone battery slowly lowering and lowering, and then when it gets to 1% it flashes a few times before dying.

“Accurate”, I said out loud, and then I laughed bitterly.

Just then, a box that I was using to organize with, fell from the chair I probably shouldn’t have placed it on to begin with. Spilling all of its contents on the hardwood.

I sighed, and picked up everything I could, until the last thing caught my eye.

Mom’s journal.

“Found you.. Sorry friend, your keeper is gone now..”, I said, tossing the book onto the coffee table.

I flopped back down on the couch, and sighed. 

What am I going to do?

My eyes wandered around the room with my thoughts until they landed on the journal.

I pondered. It felt like an invasion of privacy. She was my mom, and I respected her. I don’t want to go snooping through her things.

But then again, she left me. I have to know why.

“Please forgive me Mom..”, I said out loud, picking the book up before cozying up on the couch.

I flipped open the cover, and her name was written in dark blue ink. I traced the words with my fingers, memorizing the letters, before I turned to the first page.

I was up all night reading, my alarm sounding from my phone brought me out of my trance. I had already called out of work the next day, but I hadn’t turned my alarm off yet. I normally worked the early shift at the hospital so my alarm was set for 2:30. I silenced the chime and turned back to the book.

I was stunned.

I read every word, every story, every line.

But whoever wrote this couldn’t have been my mother.

My kind, sweet, selfless mother. Who would never hurt a fly and would pay for people’s groceries at the store if they looked like they needed a little boost in their day.

The woman in this book is cold, heartless, vindictive, angry, and vicious.

There was a story about how in grade school, another little girl had the same color ribbons in her braids as my mom, so my mom cut them off short enough that the little girl had to have a pixie cut.

Another story, about threatening her high school biology teacher with exposing a nonexistent affair between them if he didn’t pass her in the class.

A story about her best friend teasing her about her frizzy hair at said friend’s bachelorette party, so my mom slept with the friend’s groom the night before the wedding.

She didn’t regret it.

Any of it.

The book was an endless train of her worst moments, inked on paper for all of eternity.

I flipped through the pages, back to the beginning, hoping I missed something that said the book belonged to someone else that just happened to share my mother’s name. I was desperate.

But when I flipped to the front, her name still sat there. In her familiar swooped writing.

It was hers.

My eyes began to well up with tears when I noticed a date inscribed in the bottom corner of the page.

But it didn’t make sense.

It had the date marked as yesterday.

How could that be?

I jumped large sections in the book searching through it, I made a decent dent in it last night but still had a ways to go.

I skimmed through more stories of her cheating on my father, her keying the car of my 2nd grade teacher who gave me a bad performance review, her stalking my ex boyfriend after he broke up with me before Prom.

Years and years of horrible choices.

When I got to the last page, I read the last section very carefully.

“And lastly, my daughter thinks I am loosing my wits. I am not. I have lied to her, again. She was pulling away from me. She was going to take that job as a traveling nurse and leave me, I couldn’t have that. So I have been pretending to slowly loose my mind so she stays with me. That’s it, that’s the last of it.”

I dropped the book like it was a hot coal.

No… no. This can’t be true. She’s sick! She.. was sick. She’s…

I looked at the damning book, how I wish I had just burned it when I found it.

In my tears, and rage, I marched it outside. Lighter in hand.

I can pretend, I can pretend I didn’t see it all.

I brought the flame to the cover, waiting for it to catch.

One second passed.

Then two.

The book, still pristine, was untouched. The flame danced around it.

In my frustration, I threw the book at the ground. I screamed, putting my face in my hands.

“The book is now yours.”

I look up quickly, head whipping back and forth as my breath quickens.

I surely imagined it.

“The book is now yours.”, the voice repeats. It is a hollow voice, not sounding completely from our world.

I turn around to where the voice sounded, and all I saw was the darkness of the tree line.

“NOW!”, it bellowed.

Terror ran up my arms as I quickly picked up the book, confused now. I held it shaking.

“The book is now yours. Confess to me.”, the darkness spoke.

Confess?

Is that what my mother was doing?

I opened the book up, and only blank pages greeted me.

I flipped back and forth, nothing remained. No stories of hate, betrayal, viciousness. Just pages ready to be used.

When I got to the first page, my breath caught.

Instead of my mother’s name, my name sat. In blue ink, in my handwriting. 

The date at the bottom page marked today.

I still felt the presence of the voice near me, so I cleared my throat.

“What am I to confess?”, I asked the darkness.

“Whatever has burdened you, big or small.”, it responded.

I nodded, turned, and walked inside the house. Something about it’s voice made me afraid not to do just that.

I went to the desk in the front room and picked up a pen. Sitting down in the chair, I opened the book, ignoring the front page.

I began to write.

Mainly little things. Stealing extra candy in the checkout line, lying to stay home from school, not standing up for kids who were being bullied on the playground.

One by one, I wrote down anything I’ve felt guilty about. Granted, nothing seemed so bad after reading my mother’s stories, but I wrote them all.

After what seemed like an hour, I made my last entry.

“I have finally accepted a job offer as a traveling nurse, I start in two weeks, I was going to put my mother in a nursing home that I felt was better suited to care for her ailing health. I hadn’t told her yet.”

I closed the book, picked it up, and walked back outside.

The second I closed the door, the voice spoke to me again.

“You may meet me where your mother had her final breath, when her fate was decided by the rocks and the waves.”, it said.

I gulped.

I didn’t want to go back there, ever. But how did this voice know where she died?

I had to have an answer, and explanation, maybe this thing could give me that.

I tucked the book under my arm and slowly made my walk to the cliffside. Walking through the woods at night should have frightened me, but I couldn’t focus on anything else except my mother right now.

The guilt I felt from signing her up for the nursing home was eating me alive the last week, and having to write it down made it even worse in the feelings of betraying my mom.

Even though she wasn’t actually sick.

I’ll have to process that later.

Once I make it to the cliffside, it appears empty. I see fresh footprints in the dirt from that morning, but the rest of the land is undisturbed.

That’s when I see it.

A cloaked figure is a bit down the path, looking out onto the ocean.

He slowly turns towards me as he hears my approach. 

His hood covers most of his head, but I can just barely make out gray skin, pebbled with texture. And a solemn mouth.

His eyes though, are missing from his face.

He extends his hand to me, long slender fingers and black nails.

I shakily hand him the book.

He envelops it in his robes, and is silent.

My hands are shaking so hard that I try to put them in my pockets to stay calm as I ask my question.

“Why didn’t she tell me she wanted to die?”, I asked, quietly.

The figure didn’t move.

It seemed like an eternity passed, before his words came.

“Because it wasn’t what she chose, the fates chose for her.”, he said.

I was stunned, how could something else have chosen that for her?

“I have accepted your confessions,”, the figure said, “And now you must choose.”

“What do I have to choose?”, I asked, eyeing the edge of the cliffside.

“You can either give me a name, any name of someone you want to take your place. They will die for your sins, and you walk away. Or, you can jump off this very cliffside into the dark water, and see if you survive. Your choice.”

“What? There are rocks down there! It’s obvious I would die!”, I shouted.

“Ah, yes. I see. That’s where your confessions come to play. If the fates have decided you are a good person, and deserve to live, they will adjust the water level so you won’t hit the rocks. If they decide you are bad, you will die. So you have to decide, dear, if you believe you are good.. or bad?”, his haunting voice drawled out the last word.

How could I make this choice? I believe I’m good.. but I am far from perfect.. What would the fates make of me?

I looked towards the edge.

But I couldn’t wish pain on someone else, I couldn’t. That would be horrible to try to condemn someone to any suffering. My mother must have felt the same way.

She must have.

“I will jump,” I say calmly, “I will jump and spare anyone more pain, except potentially myself..”

I walk to the edge of the cliffside and look down.

My heart is racing, but I am trying to stay as calm as I can. As calm as I’m sure my mother was.

“Are you sure of your decision?”, the voice asked me.

“Yes. I want to make the same choice as my mom..”, I said, watching the waves crash over the rocks far, far below my feet.

“That is not what your mother chose.”, the voice behind me crooned.

I looked over my shoulder.

“Yes it is, how did she die on these very rocks then?”, I asked.

“She gave a name, then turned to run. She tripped over her slippers, and fell backwards to her death.”, he stated.

“Oh.. Oh my.. Oh..”, I clutched my heart as I looked down at the water.

“Because there was an error that occurred in her ceremony, I had to remake some rules. Her life was still given, so I chose to offer an additional choice to you. I held up my bargain, I always do.”, he said intensely.

My head was still reeling from the new information on her death, I didn’t hear what was so obviously stated. 

“No, no she.. wouldn’t. She gave a name? Who would she do that to?”, I asked, facing the figure completely.

“Yours, my dear. She said yours.”, he said.

The horror on my face was painful. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. Why would she… She wouldn’t.

Then a sound escaped me.

And my cheeks felt wet.

I was crying.

After everything today, I finally shed tears over my mother’s final betrayal to me.

Her daughter.

And I knew in that moment, I could never do the same to someone else.

I solemnly turned back towards the cliffside, closed my eyes, and leapt.

The tears continued as I was falling, then I let the sobs take over.

I didn’t care about my fate, I cared that the one person in my life who I loved has betrayed me in the most horrible way. 

I cared that my mother, my good and kind mother, wasn’t the angel I thought she was.

And I hated that I still loved her.

As the waves neared my face, I took a final breath in. And squeezed my eyes shut.

The welcoming of the water enveloped me.

1lr5anw,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1lr5anw/hello_old_friend/,Hello Old Friend.,"Hello old friend, 



I haven’t written in a long time. But here we are. 



It’s humid here. The heat building with every step I took on my journey to this coffee shop, each new body on the TTC steaming the air with body heat and ragged breath.



 It feels like rain. Like the clouds are going to begin splitting, peeling themselves as water gushes down, ripping them apart to release the weight they carry. I’m on the other side of the world, and have been for almost a year, in a city full of new faces and voices and sights. 



But this heat, it made me think of sitting in that garden, the warmth wet in the air, the dry brown grass scratching at my bare legs as I stuck my thumbnail through the stalks of daisies and tied them together. Like a botanical Doctor Frankenstein I stabbed and tied and stabbed until my creation was complete, and each daisy hung, dead and deflated and deformed from my fingers. 



We called it beautiful. A lot of ugly things seemed beautiful then. 



All of those summers blur into one for me now. A constant stream of memory that flows through my thoughts whenever it can, everything and anything a reminder of that time, of that place, of those people. It’s a pain I can’t quite quantify, an ache that has settled into my chest, and infection that has carved out a space for itself throughout my body. One that I welcomed. 



Strangers walk past coated in perfume and cologne and I am jolted back to my thirteen year old self, tall and gangly and alone. It takes me to those rooms, to the gardens and interiors I didn’t mean to memorise.



I can’t erase them from myself. I have tried. They are part of me, I can walk through them when I close my eyes, I could tell you where to find the tea, the coffee, the mugs, the milk. I can feel the wood beneath my bare feet, the banister under my hand as I count the steps upwards to those rooms. 



For ten years I sat in that grass, savouring those hot days. 



I ran outside when it was raining and embraced each droplet. I watched the clouds pass with no shadows, the sky white and grey and blinding. 



The curtains were never pulled, unless it was the final night, and I would sit and watch the weather pass us by in a room that used to feel like home.

Alpha Kael Creed’s hand sliced through the air like a blade. And then a sharp crack echoed through the room.



My head snapped to the side. A metallic taste flooded my mouth, and a ringing noise exploded in my ears like a swarm of bees trapped in my skull.



I stumbled, catching myself on the edge of the desk, my fingers trembling.



My left cheek went numb before it began to burn—hot, sharp, humiliating.



When I looked up, Kael’s hand was still hanging midair, his knuckles bone-white with tension.



My mate. My fiancé. And now the man who’d just struck me in front of everyone—to defend his precious Beta—Riley.



For a brief second, Kael’s expression faltered. A flicker of guilt. But it vanished, swallowed by rage and impatience.



“Talia, can you stop making a scene for once?”



Someone snorted. A few others chuckled under their breath. No one stepped in.



Riley stood beside him, chestnut curls catching the light like strands of honey. Her red lips curled into a lazy, mocking smile.



“Kael, don’t be so harsh. Look—you’ve scared your little mate. Poor thing’s about to cry.”



Kael’s jaw tightened, his eyes still smoldering, but he reined in his tone, voice sharp yet measured. “Talia, this is Ashveil Pack, not Silverclaw. Try to remember where you are.”



The room buzzed with murmurs and half-stifled laughter.



I touched the corner of my mouth. It came away wet, though I couldn’t tell if it was blood or tears.



Eighteen years of knowing this man. I’d seen every side of his temper—but I never knew a slap could sting this bad.



Humiliation, rage, and heartbreak twisted together like barbed wire in my chest.



I dug my nails into my palms, swallowing the scream lodged in my throat.



Kael started to say something else, but I didn’t care anymore.



I turned on my heel, grabbed my bag, and shoved the glass doors open.



Behind me, someone let out a sharp whistle. “Look at her run. She waddles like a damn penguin!”



I had no idea where I was going—I just knew I couldn’t stay here.



I couldn’t stand one more minute in Ashveil Pack. Not with those eyes on me. Not with that handprint burning on my face.



Sure, Kael never had much patience with me. But he’d never hit me before.



This wasn’t just a slap. It was the first time in my life someone had ever struck me.



Not even when my world first fell apart at six years old.



Back then, Silverclaw Pack was attacked, and my parents moved us into the Ashveil Pack for safety.



That’s when I first saw Kael.



He was sitting in the yard, playing with a toy truck. Sunlight streamed down, stretching his shadow long across the ground until it brushed the tips of my shoes.



We grew up next door to each other.



My mom used to say we were like two saplings growing side by side. Only… Kael grew faster. Stronger.



When we were in grade school, a boy named Tommy stuck a wad of chewed-up gum in my ponytail.



The class burst into laughter.



The teacher tried to smooth it over. “He just likes you, sweetheart. Boys tease girls they like. Don’t cry.”



Those words stung worse than the gum.



After school, I cried all the way home.



Kael’s father, David Creed, heard what happened. He called out to his son, who was doing homework on the floor.



“Kael. Tomorrow. Go have a word with Tommy in second grade.”



The next day, Kael stormed into my classroom and kicked the back door open.



He moved like a wild little beast, charging Tommy with his tiny fists clenched. He slammed a fist on the boy’s desk.



“Listen up,” he growled, grabbing Tommy by the collar—still speaking in that soft, childish voice. “Talia’s my little sister. If you ever mess with her again, I’ll end you.”



Before leaving, he patted my head.



And from that moment on, I became Kael’s shadow.



Chapter 2

Back in middle school, Kael would always hit the field after class to play soccer. His teammates would drag him off for ice cream, and I’d squat on the sidelines with my backpack, waiting so long that my stomach would start growling.



He’d grumble and yank me up by the arm. “Talia, are you glued to me or something?”



But he’d still break his strawberry popsicle in half and give me the bigger piece.



As I remembered, he hated when people said he ""hung out with girls.""



One time I went looking for him, and his buddies started teasing, “Look, Kael brought his little mate!”



He got so pissed he chucked his whole bag of marbles down the storm drain.



But when I missed school the next day with a fever, he skipped class, climbed the fence, and showed up outside my window.



He tossed crumpled notes through the screen, each one scrawled with a messy little joke meant to make me laugh.



By high school, I caught him staring at me more times than I could count—when I was chewing on a pen while solving equations; when I tucked my hair behind my ear; even when I dozed off on my desk.



His gaze would land softly on me like the brush of a summer breeze—barely there, but impossible to ignore.



One morning, I turned around suddenly and caught him in the act.



“Kael,” I said, locking eyes with him, “how do you solve this problem?”



His pen slipped right out of his hand.



Sunlight poured in through the windows, lighting up the tips of his ears until they looked like they were glowing.



“I, uh...” He scrambled to pick up his pen, his bangs brushing my fingers. “It’s just... I mean...”



His voice trailed off into a mumble.



I rested my chin on my hand and just watched him.



Turned out, the same boy who once punched another kid for bullying me—would tremble just from being near me.



Outside the window, moonflower petals drifted down like snow onto his open textbook.



On the night I turned eighteen, under the glow of the full moon, our wolves finally recognized each other.



My wolf had no doubt: he’s the one. He’s our mate.



Our parents were overjoyed and immediately proposed a union between the packs.



And Kael? He pulled me into the fire escape and slammed the door behind us.



The motion-sensor lights flickered overhead. His palm was clammy, but his grip on my fingers was so tight it almost hurt.



“Think this through,” he said hoarsely. “You’re still young. What if... What if someone better comes along someday?”



I reached up on tiptoe and pressed my fingers over his lips.



“There’s no one better than you, Kael.”



He flinched like I’d shocked him—then kissed me like he was finally letting go of every hesitation he’d ever had.



In the dark, I touched the scar on the back of his neck—the one he got in eighth grade, shielding me from falling debris.



That night, moonlight filtered through the iron grates, casting broken shadows over us both.



And his amber eyes shimmered like something out of a dream.



After college, I joined the Ashveil Enterprises—a company long controlled by Kael’s family, and ended up working under Kael.



Everything was perfect.



Right up until we were about to get engaged.



That’s when she showed up.



Riley.



An Omega transfer. Kael’s new Beta.



From day one, she played the sweet girl card hard—handing out coffees with a megawatt smile.



“Nice to meet you all! I’m looking forward to working with you!”



But when she reached my desk, she froze.



“Oh my god...” she covered her mouth with a giggle. “Are people still using Hello Kitty thermoses?”



I didn’t say anything.



She bit her lip. “Oops, I didn’t mean it in a bad way! I just say what’s on my mind. No offense, okay?” She leaned closer. “But seriously... aren’t you a little old for all this cutesy stuff? I thought women in the workplace were supposed to be, like, elegant and put-together.”



It felt like the whole office turned to stare at me at once.



My Hello Kitty keyboard, the figurines on my desk, the pink dust covers around my monitor...



Kael used to call these things “Talia’s fortress.”



Now, under those judgmental eyes, they felt like a childish display begging to be laughed at.



My ears rang like someone had poured acid into my skull.



Riley's constant laugh drilled straight through me, loud and shrill, like a jackhammer cracking open the little world I’d built for myself—cute, safe, and stupidly naive.



“Geez, relax. It’s just a joke, grandma. Don’t tell me you can’t even take a little teasing?”



My knuckles went white, fingers digging into the hem of my skirt.



“Enough.”



Kael’s voice rang out behind me.



I turned and saw his mouth curled in a sharp, dangerous smile—his signature tell when he was pissed.



The sun backlit him from the floor-to-ceiling windows, giving his profile a golden edge.



For a second, he looked just like the boy who once beat up a classmate for gluing gum in my hair.



Riley pouted. “Sorry, I was just joking. You’re not really going to overreact like this, are you?”



“This isn’t a coffee shop. If you want to gossip, Riley, then maybe you should quit and go start a podcast.”



She slunk back to her desk, face stiff with barely concealed rage.



Chapter 3

I don’t even know when things changed between Kael and Riley.



It was like I blinked, and suddenly… the lunch our housekeeper sent over from home came with three sets of utensils.



I stared at the takeout bags, my voice shaking. “There’s nothing here I even like.”



Kael didn’t even look up from his reports.



“We’re doing salads today. Riley says it’s good to cleanse the system once in a while…”



Riley slid into the seat next to me, holding her designer coffee like it was a prop in a rom-com.



“Oops! My bad, Talia\~”



Her manicured nails tapped on the lid, sending out a hollow rhythm.



“I forgot you’re not into salads. But hey, grown-ups do need to eat healthy sometimes, right?”



She left the rest unsaid—but the smug curve of her lips finished it for her.



I looked at her, my voice quiet but steady.



“You keep saying my name like we’re best friends or something. Newsflash—you're older than me. Should I be calling you grandma?”



The office went dead silent.



For a second, Riley looked like I’d slapped her. Her perfectly winged eyeliner twitched.



That’s when Kael finally looked up from his desk—just to frown at me.

I found her attractive, we talked in a group setting, I asked for her number, and after a week of texting, I invited her out for coffee, saying I’d really like to get to know her better.

She responded positively but was about to leave for a 3-week trip. She said we could meet the next day for a quick coffee if I was free (I wasn’t in town). While she was traveling, we talked every few days and she’d reply with how her trip was going.

She just got back yesterday, and we talked about 4th of July plans. I told her to let me know if she’s looking for something to do and that it’d be fun to celebrate with her. She responded:
“Yes that sounds fun! Let me figure out what’s happening tomorrow when I’m back and I can let you know when I’m free 😊”

This morning, she texted saying she’s free tomorrow evening or on the weekend and asked about my plans. I said I’m free all weekend and that my only plans are seeing her tomorrow night. I gave her two options: fireworks or quiet dinner downtown.

A few hours later, she replied:
“Ah so sorry can we meet at the weekend? A coffee one afternoon on Saturday or Sunday? I think I’ve overpacked my day tomorrow and quite jet lagged so my bedtime is early for the next couple of days 🙃”

I’m kind of deflated, I had no other plans, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. More importantly: Was this just bad timing, or is this her way of gently letting me down?

La Michoacana also had a corkboard, but that entire building is undergoing construction and they've temporarily been wiped off the surface of the earth.

My dear Malou, 

Today, we repulsed another Serlic attack. If I had written you a letter following every single one of their attacks since this war began, I would be destitute from spending all my money at the commissary. It wasn’t a major battle by any means. It was one of their many attempts to probe our defenses utilizing the same strategies. But it was different this time. 

I followed Captain Malak over the top of the trenches with the rest of my squad in tow so that we could clear the bodies before they began to stink. And when we began to remove the masks from these bodies, we all came to realize just how poorly the war must be going for Serle. 

Malou, these were not men. They were boys. No older than your brother and my nephews. Their uniforms and equipment were so ill-fitting that it looked like they were playing dress-up with their father’s uniform. Many of my men could not stomach this and retched or prayed to their gods. I kept my composure until I stumbled across the corpse of a Serlic gunner sitting inside of a crater. 

The poor wretch had been struck by a one in a million shot between the plates and slowly bled out. He held a journal in his lap. After giving it a quick read, the man had evidently been in this war for as long as I have. I sat there for a long time pondering about this man and how he came all this way to just wind up being another corpse.

In another life, perhaps, we would be sitting on the porch of his farmhouse back in Serle, sipping coffee and howling with laughter as we traded stories with each other. I fear that this war has done nothing to preserve our nation and has only made monsters out of all of us, Malou.

1lr4p9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1lr4p9d/when_is_time_to_leave/,When is time to leave?,"Hi, I'm being in my LDR for a bit more than 2 months. At the beginning he was very attentive, and he always talked about meeting for the first time and I was over the moon. The plan was that he was going to come visit me because I need a visa to visit him and we didn't want to wait that much. He get his passport and everything, I was waiting for him to request my days off at work, and everything seems to be settled.
Until, we have a disagreement, I have depression and I was changing medication and that day was rough (I find out later that some medication tend to give you more symptoms at the beginning and also I was having a thing related to cptsd, my therapist told me that after) I cried the whole day while we're texting, and I didn't wanted to bother him so I just wanted to be alone while he was at work. Everything was fine but then I called him, after his shift, and he didn't check on me, I feel bad and I texted him about this later on, because he went to sleep. The next morning he thought we're having an argument but reassured that I was just asking for a check in, and he acted defensive saying that I was doing this on a busy day (I didn't know he was busy) because of his dog birthday, and said that he feels for me but he has obligations, that hurt me. I only said thank you for letting me know what's my place in your life. He started calling me and I said that I don't want to talk to him, and that he can do his stuff calmly. And he say bye. And I say bye. 
For the record, this was the first time I was having this depressive episode and was just asking for some affection and care, no second intentions I swear. 

Anyways, he blocked me and then he said that he thought that I was breaking up with him, but I didn't say so. I just wanted to get some air and get back later. But, apparently I was wrong, I apologize and said that I want him in my life and that I just asking for a check in and nothing more. And we get back together. 
But since then anything hasn't been the same. 

He didn't compliment me anymore, or call me cute names, we videochat and he's doing his business and I'm doing mine, I felt that we disconnected, and feel sad about it. He used to remaining me for taking my meds, and he was learning my native language, but not anymore. I asked him if everything was ok between us, and if there's something I can do to fix things, but he said that everything was fine. But still, he stayed distant. 

I decided to give us a chance and try to stay together because I really care about him, and maybe he's under pressure on his job, and also because he had to paid a repair for his car and he said that was the money to come and visit me, and that he cannot do that soon now. I understand, maybe he's overwhelmed, but I'm just making assumptions, he doesn't talk to me, or let me in. 

Above of all of this, he have a female bf, and she doesn't like me, she didn't even know me, not even on videochat, when he talked about me with her she immediately said 'don't give her money' I never ask him for money, I'm doing well by myself and I'm fully independent. (in fact I give his dog a gift for her bday, and when he thought we broke up ask me how to repaid me for that, and that hurt me as well because - at least in my culture - a gift is a gift, and I did it because I wanted to, but anyways) 
Either way, I didn't got jealous or saying anything about their friendship because I know that she is important to him, ""is like a sister to me"" he said. So I respected that. 
But she's the damsel in distress, she always need him, and since he's being with me, he doesn't run away to save her anymore. And also that girl is in a very toxic relationship with a bf she have long distance as well. 
So, I think that maybe she's influencing him, somehow... Idk is a gut feeling more than a fact. 

A few days back I caught him giggling while texting on his phone, I was in an online meeting (he call me from his iPad) and when I looked at him he changed his expression. Then he started attending calls and text outside of the camera, and he remained distanced from me... 
The other day he made an extra effort to look good for a meeting with his male friend, he cut his hair, shave, doing exercises, dress very well, and he picked him friend up from his house, then went to grab coffee, but then they also went to have lunch... Idk that was kinda weird because this friend of his live very far away and my bf doesn't like to drive. 
That made me feel insecure, and that feeling was starting eating me alive. 

So I asked him, hey baby, I feel that we are kinda distant lately, and I was wondering if maybe you're looking validation or attention somewhere else... 
He said no, and then he said that he's with me on the phone all the time, and that he was bend over backwards for me by getting his passport and that what tf else do I want... 
That made me cry (the bad words trigger me because I'm a DV survivor, he knows that), I said 'can you just say no and give me some reassurance please, that's all I'm asking' and he started yelling that i was demanding more, that he has the right to talk to his sister (aka the best friend, that I didn't even mention) and that what he's doing was not enough for me and that he was pissed, I say 'why you're angry with me?' he said that he don't know. I started saying that I appreciate everything, and I only wanted to feel safe again, he made a face like he was tired and I ask if he was tired of me... He said no, I stopped crying and say that don't ever talk to me like that and that I want us to be good, he said 'try harder' and then when I was about to respond he yelled I'm in the store! And i didn't say anything more... 
I wipe my tears, and went to a work meeting (online) and then when I'm finished he act like nothing happened, and I did the same. 

I feel like I'm the problem, that we start to be good and that I messed up, idk maybe I'm asking for too much? Should I just leave him alone and stop complaining? I wasn't complaining just craving for some connection and affection... We didn't even have intimacy anymore, and when I talked about this he told me that he's tired... And when I asked him why he stopped calling me cute names he said that he was busy. Seems like excuses. I don't deserve this... I'm confused and hurt. Am I in the wrong? I can't stop crying because I miss the old him. I think I messed up everything.

The thing is for now I don’t wanna completely cut out any foods. But Im planning to have a simple diet of salad with chicken and dressing, coffee with sugar free creamer, eggs, and carrots. And whatever is left over I can use however I want. I get over 140g protein (which I wang bc I workout) 

My skin has been breaking out the past year. Nothing has been working. Is it the carbs? My weight is fine I look okay because I workout so it isn’t me trying to lose a ton of weight just some weight. But I really want my skin to look better without needing to cut out things 100%. For example today I had a canned coffee and I can still fit that in.  Does lowering carbs under 100g make a difference?

My skin isn’t like absolutely terrible. It isn’t cyclic acne. But my cheeks have been breaking out and literally nothing has been working the past YEAR. I’ve tried tretinoin, hormone supplements, different products. It wasn’t always like this. 


Before, I’d eat lots of carbs but do A LOT of cardio and had clear skin with my routine. But now, yes I maintained my weight, and I workout enough to keep my body toned, but
I workout way less especially with cardio. Maybe working out less and eating carbs as a combo is what’s ruining me. Can cutting carbs make a difference without needing to completely cut out foods? Like is it the amount of carbs that make people break out

Also English isn’t my first language so please don’t be surprised if there’s a bunch of errors. But here goes it. I female just turned 30. ( My husband 34)And a week before I asked my husband of 10 years what he was out doing after work. He sighed and said “ I was actually planning something for your birthday! If you really wanna know” I felt bad and said sorry And we moved one. Then comes the day of my birthday. I was working the previous night so I slept in and he took the kids out. But I knew he was doing some planning. After I woke it was around 4 pm I called and he seemed busy. I could hear in the background that he was in a store buying things of course. So I got off the phone and let him be. I was home alone so I decided to get some ice coffee. I was off for the day snd wanted to do something while I waited for them. As I was heading out I called him and asked how long he’d be and he said about 40 minutes to an hour. So I thought I had time. My sister in law (his brothers wife) calls me and says happy birthday and wanted to come along with me. She and I are pretty close and I didn’t mind. We ended up getting ice cream instead of ice coffee and stopped at a store next door. Looked around and then left. My SIL husband calls her and tells her to come to my place as he and their children were waiting on her at my place for a surprise birthday party. I kinda knew what was going on once she said she would come to my home. I pretended I didn’t know what was going on as we laughed about it. We get to my home and sure enough they were all there. My husband and our kids his brother and his kids. I could see the gifts and cake. I was so grateful for the effort he put in given my precious birthday we had been going through some marital stuff and didn’t get anything (he didn’t have a good job).  I was so HAPPY!!! He bought a beautiful cake that we all enjoyed and gifts that were amazing! After the birthday party which was short because we wanted to go out as a couple and get dinner everyone left. He changed his mind and said it was late (9pm)  and that he and I both had work. He mentioned I took a little while long when I was out with my SIL. I apologized and said we could go out Thursday because the next day I was working. He was upset and in his feelings. I explained myself. But he was still in his feelings. That night I couldn’t go to sleep because I work night shift and is very hard to fall asleep when I’m not working. Anyways, Thursdays here and we do nothing. He’s still grumpy after I spoke to him multiple times. But his demeanor hasn’t changed. He was supposed to talk to his brother and his wife so we could go out and they watch the kids for us for a few hours but he said he didn’t feel like it. He took the kids to his brothers house as I’m writing this and just feel so dumb and bad about what’s happening. I don’t have family here or friends. My one and only friend lives in a different state and have been adamant about telling her because she’s so hot headed. So I decided to take it to Reddit. Am I over reacting about this? Is this normal? Am I the A********** for going to get ice cream with my SIL? And not hurrying back home and waiting on my husband and kids?

I've been trying to simply pull one tarot card and one oracle card daily. I ground before-hand, and center, and wear my grounding onyx (which is amazing and outside of tarot I feel constantly grounded when I wear it) as I perform the reading. I try to pull the cards in the morning when my energy is fresh.

But tarot is still causing a massive energy crash. I try to raise energy from the Earth to use, but I don't think I'm doing a good job at it since I'm crashing so badly. Sometimes, eating helps. Other times I take my daily nap way earlier than usual because I'm just that drained.

**Am I not doing something that I should be? Am I doing something I shouldn't be? Or is tarot simply something that takes lots of energy out of me? Any advice/help is appreciated!**

Additional context if helpful:

This energy crash feels similar to my chronic illness crashes, just way earlier and immediately after tarot. What I mean by that is, if I do a major task (grocery shopping/driving, studying for an hour, etc.) then usually around midday my energy crashes and I get extremely fatigued. I literally have to take a nap in order to regain enough energy to stay awake until it is time to go to sleep for the 8 hour stretch. My body aches and feels weak, my brain fogs up, you get the idea. Well, it feels the same with reading tarot. It is as though I just drove, did an errand, and came back.

I do a daily coffee spell, and this does not drain me (I ensure to draw up energy from the Earth, though I always think of it as a smaller amount than what I pull up for tarot readings). I do a shower cleansing, and this does not drain me. But tarot? Yikes.",1,1751586891.0,witchcraft,5,0.67,False

because JUST THIS WEEK my high volume, district wide HIGH PERFORMANCE store, hired someone with no barista experience whatsoever…. they have never worked in a coffee shop, starbucks or otherwise. yet they are going to be this store’s new supervisor as of TWO WEEKS FROM NOW. they are, as of yesterday, learning the job from the GROUND UP. 

they have no experience. at all. meanwhile, there are baristas at this store with YEARS of experience not being given an OPPORTUNITY to develop, when they WANT TO, and when they could AND SHOULD be supervisors. 

like, does the prioritization of “internal promotion” only apply to those hired more recently? and is this because they can be paid LESS than tenured partners, such as the baristas in my store that have been with the company for 4-5 years, or is it fair game for anyone? again, these are not incapable baristas in my store that wanted to develop. but i guess some of them applied for the job too late…. because the opportunity was listed one day, then claimed by a new hire TWO DAYS LATER. 

per this experience, “internal promotion” can apply to anyone. including a two day barista. meaning that it can truly *especially* apply to BRAND NEW HIRES, who are only making $16 at base, and thus can be promoted for LESS MONEY?

realistically, i do not believe that this “internal promotion” scam at ALL benefits pre-existing partners. i am witnessing the lie in real time, and sincerely do NOT believe i am the only person watching his shit go down. especially not when they have been saying the SAME stuff since *2015.* 

i just wanna know if anyone else is experiencing this in their own store. because this shit is SO disheartening.

To join the corporation, players will be required deposits, or a purchase of items (Like a single coffee mug for $10,000).

Weather: High 60-70s / Low 40s

Total elevation gain: ~7000 ft

Trip pictures: https://imgur.com/a/LOG8TzX

Lighterpack: https://lighterpack.com/r/o83sjd (somewhat out of date, some new gear not added to this list because I’ve been too lazy to weigh them)

Bugs: Lots of mosquitoes, none at night

Snow: patches on Glen Pass, Used microspikes from recommendations

Logistics: Reservations made 6 months in advance through recreation.gov. Picked clockwise direction for gradual hike. Picked up my permit a day before the hike to have more flexibility in the morning (left from Fresno and rented a car)

Water availability: max carry 1.2L. Creeks plentiful. Passes are drier, but water available at least every 4 miles, if not more frequent

Training: recreational power lifter. Picked up more local trail running a few weeks before the trip to train for elevation gain



Day 1: Roads End to Woods Creek Crossing (14-15 miles)
Started around 8AM. Hike up was gradual and slowly changed in terrain from lower forests to subalpine forest. Reached the famed upper paradise crossing a little before noon. Met up with a bunch of guys and crossed at a site 50 yards downstream from the downed bridge. It was knee-high. The ranger I spoke to at the permit station noted that the water levels seemed to be paradoxically lower in the morning. Crossing was very secure and the water at this location was not particularly rapid at all. The water closer to the downed bridge definitely was deeper and more rapid. Arrived to Woods Creek crossing around 5PM. Already lots of campers who picked spots really close to the rail. Ran into many PCT thru hikers. Found out that my Soto igniter finally crapped out after 7 years of casual use and asked some fellow campers and one of them ultimately gave me one of their backup lighters which I gracefully accepted. Found a good spot down the trail in a more private location.



Day 2: Woods Creek Crossing to Upper Rae Lakes. (10-12 miles)
Knew I had a pretty short day so got out of camp pretty leisurely. Got to Upper Rae after taking some breaks at Lower Rae in the early afternoon. It was quite warm and exposed. The mosquitoes were very much out and about and sitting in my campsite closer to the sixty lakes basin trail, the mosquitoes swarmed. The campsite was exposed and quite warm in the sun so didn’t linger and decided to go to Sixty Lakes Basin. Didn’t encounter anyone on this side trail and made it all the way to the end. It was pretty, but quite frankly wasn’t as scenic or expansive I was hoping for. Probably wouldn’t have done this again if I came back. Got back to camp almost at sunset. Had wanted to go on the Dragon Lake trail, but the ranger noted it wasn’t as trafficked and didn’t end up going to check it out or crossing up North Dragon Pass.



Day 3: Upper Rae Lakes to Kearsarge Pass to Vidette Meadow Switchbacks (9-10 miles)
Woke up early to catch the sunrise in camp and make and early finish on Glen Pass. Got to the top of Glen Pass around 10AM. A few snow patches on the way up and the biggest one by the top was 3-4 feet deep and very much post-holed. Didn’t feel that micro spikes would have been that helpful or needed. If you did it later in the afternoon, I’d imagine it would be pretty slushy so felt like morning time was the best time to do it. Met a bunch of PCT thru hikers and a few SOBO JMTers at the top. Took a long break savoring the view. Sauntered my way down and ran into a couple who skinny-dipped in the alpine lake (certified badass!). It was still early in the afternoon, so wanted to bag Kearsarge after having done it back in 2018. Went by the way of Bullfrog lake and found a spot off trail to leave my bear canister. Got to the top of Kearsage and met even more PCT hikers. One of them was a 10-year old kid hiking with his brothers and mom! Descended Kearsarge and took a bath at Bullfrog. Weather was perfect and there were no mosquitoes out at all. Made my way back onto the PCT to the famed Vidette Meadow overlook. Desperately wanted to find a good campsite to enjoy it for sunset and sunrise. Found a spot down the trail with a ton of mosquitoes. 



Day 4: Vidette Meadow Switchbacks to Roads End (12 miles)
Enjoyed sunrise again at the Vidette Meadow switchback. Made the (very) long descent back to the car. Hike was pretty but very tedious after many full days of alpine views. Tons of mosquitoes still. End of hike was decently exposed and quite warm. Ran into a couple of amateur backpackers whose filter clogged out so in true “trail provides” fashion, I gifted them my Platypus quickdraw. Made a leisurely drive back to the car and day tripped Sequoia and hit up all the easy tourist spots.




Highlights:

Bathing at bullfrog lake - nobody there and pretty much had the whole lake to myself

Vidette meadow overlook - The classic PCT view. Just as beautiful as I remembered

Thru Hikers - must have ran into at least 50 thru hikers. Rooting for them! Crazy to see their trail legs in action. I could tell most of them hike all day. Despite their presence, I found that the trail never felt crowded and I spent the vast majority of the day hiking alone. 

Camping sites - Most sites were too close to the trail, but there were plenty of trails just off trail that were still used but not as exposed. There was basically no wind and good tree cover so my Durston could get set up anywhere and be 100% fine



Lowlights:

Bad mosquitoes. My super power used to be not getting stung ever, but somehow they feasted on me this time

Sixty Lakes Basin - Didn’t really feel like it was worth the side trip. Views at the end weren’t particularly expansive



Gear Notes:

Melanzana merino hoodie - tried this for the first time. I have a senchi merino and I liked the melly hood more. Pretty sure it’s not SPF-rated though as I felt I got burned through it and the mosquitoes certainly bit me through it. Kept me warm at night. Might have been a little too warm in the day without much option to vent (like my BD alpenglow pro, which is still my favorite shirt)

Senchi pants - best pants for camp and to keep my quilt protected from my dirty clothes

Garmin messenger - didn’t activate the preset messaging before I left and it was pretty much useless. Would 100% recommend to troubleshoot this before you start your trip

I work at caribou coffee for almost a month now and randomly today I was asked to clean a bathroom by a manager that I hadn’t worked with at all during my month here maybe seen leaving once or twice … she just assumed I knew how to clean they’re bathrooms I told her that I haven’t cleaned you guys bathrooms before and asked if I should even be doing that for reference I work on food they always have me making sandwiches etc … I don’t think those 2 mix.

If bathrooms do get cleaned they get cleaned between 6-7 pm or maybe 5 by a manager (I only work (12-4pm maybe will stayed till 5pm) I have never had any of the other mangers I usually work with or the general manager request that of me or never seen any manager ask a team member to clean the bathroom 😂😂😂… I didn’t even know that was apart of my job nor did I see that in the job description when applying . I applied to make coffee make some food maybe and cash handling and maybe deal with customers not to clean up bodily fluids and smell nasty restrooms u guys respectfully don’t pay enough for that 


I worked at McDonald’s when I was 16 and there was a gang of teenagers young adults (team members) were never asked to clean a bathroom that was always a managers job that’s why I’m so confused on why that was asked of me I didn’t touch those toilet seats i wiped down the mirror and stayed there acting like I did sum and left and just as I was leaving she leaves and tells me bye and see you later I honestly barely see her so that’s good she kinda rubbed me the wrong way ….

Are my feelings valid?,"I'm 33 and I've been dating my girlfriend (28) for over a year now, and except for my birthday, she has never offered to pay for a single meal (or for anything really, except for a cup of coffee every now and then). This is starting to really bother me, and I’m wondering if my feelings are valid or if I’m overreacting.

For context, she has a job and earns her own money, so it’s not like she’s unable to contribute. But every time we go out, she seems to expect me to cover the bill without question. I’ve noticed she never even makes a gesture to offer, like reaching for her wallet or suggesting we split the check. I feel like she sees me as a ""provider,"" which might make sense in a marriage or a more traditional dynamic, but we’re just dating. To me, it feels one-sided and unfair.

I don’t expect her to pay for every meal or even half, but I think offering every 4-5 meals or so would show some gratitude and mutual effort in the relationship. The fact that she hasn’t offered at all in over a year feels like a red flag to me. I’m starting to question if this is a sign of deeper issues, like entitlement or a lack of respect for me.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Are my feelings valid, or am I making too big a deal out of it? How can I bring this up with her without causing a fight? I’d really appreciate any advice on how to approach this or if I should see this as a bigger warning sign.

**TL;DR:** I've been dating my girlfriend (28) for over a year, and aside from my birthday, she's never offered to pay for anything—not even a casual meal. She has a job, so it’s not about money.

On I-40 Eastbound, just before the 201 exit is a perpetual way rough spot taking up about half of the right lane. 

You can tell who the locals are because they either wait until they're past it in the left lane to get over to the right lane to take that exit, or they'll skooch over to the far left side of the right lane to dance around most of it. 

Semis and RVs are usually in the right lane at that point. (Local actual traffic speeds are in the 70-75mph zone usually, sometimes higher.)  I've seen RVs hit it and start to meander around and once saw a guy pulling a big RV trailer start to fishtail there. 

This rough spot is kind of a really wide pretty rough shallow pothole / subsidence area maybe (just guessing here) 4X4'.  It's been repeatedly ""repaired"" but the repairs never last. My amateur guess is that the material under the road keeps sinking right there.

Anyway, it's not a spot you want to hit if you're about to put a hot cup of coffee up to your lips or if you're otherwise doing something that needs a smooth road, or if you're just not paying attention.

If I'm ahead of a semi as we near that spot I'll usually tap my brakes quickly twice as an attempted ""yo, heads up!"" signal in case that helps them.

It was expected kind of.   We always had hope until he was sent home on hospice. I'm grateful for the time we had,  but I'm sad it's over. I'll never be sad it happened though.  He taught me so many things in our 23 years together.  We went from teens to adults.  I thought we would grow old and get wrinkly together,  I guess God had a different plan. 
   I'm still battling depression and trying to survive. I don't feel like I've thrived, since he passed.  The past 5 months,  have been a whirlwind of emotions.  I've got plenty of reasons why,  but all in all, it's depression and grief coming on in waves.   I changed too many things in my life at once and lost all the things that I thought previously defined me.  I was this and that and this and that and wore lots of hats,  both figuratively and literally.  I love a good costume hat. (Think leprechaun, Halloween,and frosty top hats)
   I know other people have lost their people, it's always hard.  I think one of the major factors this past year is that I fell in love again.  I fell so hard,  I dug myself a hole to keep me from getting loved by him.  It seemed like I just pushed and pushed him away.  I even kept dating and doing other things, when I knew I loved him, even though I shouldn't have.  Now I've got widow grief and another lost love that I don't know if I'll get back, because I went off the deep end.   I isolated myself,  from work,  friends, and family.  They thought I was on drugs.  I admit I enjoy THC too much,  and cigarettes far too often.  I used those as a coping mechanism; along with coffee and late night driving. 
   The grief of me in the lowest place I've ever been.  I am literally starting myself over at 42, our atleast that is what it feels like to me. 

Parenting... I suck... I've tried to keep going for our kid, oh how I've failed him in so many ways. I know we'll be OK,  but we've both got work to do,  but I need to lead him. I'm his mom and dad right now.  


  I'm seeking grief counseling,  but I've not really committed to a therapist or a regime yet.... what counseling/ books/podcasts work best for you?  Any suggestions for me?


I've got some books I haven't read that i should.  Tuesdays with Morrie, it's OK your not ok,  boundaries, the Holy Bible .

It Didn’t Bleed.,"My grandfather spoke of things that walk this world that are older than man, older than the land itself. They do not knock. They do not wait. And by the time you realize you’ve seen one, it might already be too late.

I never believed him. Until now.

We’d just settled on the ranch that spring. Far from town. Wind and silence and space. The kind of place you go to get right with the land. Or with something older.

The morning it happened the sky was clear and still. Not a bird in sight. Cattle standing quiet at the far fence. I walked out with my coffee and leaned on the gate. The sun was just breaking above the ridge.

I saw it coming from the tree line. Took it for a stray dog at first. But no dog moves like that. No dog is that big. Its head was low and its back was broad and it moved slow.

As it came closer I saw it was a wolf. But not the kind you see on TV. This thing was the size of a damn horse. Gray. Thick. Powerful. Its paws kicked up dust and the cattle didn’t flinch. They watched it. Calm. Like they’d seen it before.

And I didn’t move either. That’s what I think about most now. I just stood there. Let it come.

It walked right up to the fence. Close enough to touch. I don’t know why I did it but I reached out and laid a hand on its fur.

It let me.

The coat was coarse. Warm. It stood there breathing. Heavy but not fast. Like it wasn’t worried about me or what I might do.

Then it turned.

It walked to the nearest calf and without sound or warning snapped its jaws around the neck. One quick jerk and the body dropped limp.

That broke the spell.

I pulled my pistol. Fired three rounds. Dust flew. The wolf didn’t even blink.

I ran to my truck and got my rifle from the rack. A big gun. Fired once. The sound cracked across the field.

The wolf turned to look at me.

It looked amused.

It dropped the calf. Turned. And walked off into the open land behind the pens.

I didn’t fire again. I just watched it go until the dust took it.

I followed the tracks. They were deep in the soft earth. Clear. Heavy. I followed them out into the field.

Then they stopped.

Just like that.

No blood. No trail. No drag marks.

A few feet ahead I saw something else. A single line of barefoot prints. Human. Walking away like nothing had happened.

I stood there for a long time. Didn’t call anyone. Didn’t tell my wife. Just walked back to the house and locked the door.

My grandfather was right. There are things out there that wear the shape of animals. But they’re not. Not really. I think they’re older than us. I think they remember when the world belonged to something else.

And sometimes they come back just to remind us.",1,1751584208.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

half marathon best on hard course 1:32:11 and 5k 19:48 in march. will try again tomorrow on 5k. lets not get side tracked on the pace since its a GU Gel question.

I am going for my first marathon and shooting for 3:00 to 3:15 finishing time. I been using gels on my last 3 long runs  but not as many as I should  because I was trying to see how much I can handle. I had 5 last weekend and it worked fine meaning no GI issues.

This weekend is my longest run and I will use 10 GU Gels.

 first 4 have no caffeine (strawberry banana flavored). will take them every 25 minutes.  should be about  10 miles.  next week I will change to a high sodium GU gel of 280mg

next 6 caffeinated (espresso love with 70mg caffeine and 125mg sodium) 

for the race I will take a gel at every other hydration station.

early coffee before the run. I am used to 3 strong coffees per day.  first I was thinking I could do 10 caffeinated gels but I found out it would be over my daily dose. 

  
for those of you with experience,  what do you think about my plan.  what suggestions do you have. thank you.

1lr3kwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1lr3kwy/the_bulletproof_wolf/,The Bulletproof Wolf,"My grandfather spoke of things that walk this world that are older than man, older than the land itself. They do not knock. They do not wait. And by the time you realize you’ve seen one, it might already be too late.

I never believed him. Until now.

We’d just settled on the ranch that spring. Far from town. Wind and silence and space. The kind of place you go to get right with the land. Or with something older.

The morning it happened the sky was clear and still. Not a bird in sight. Cattle standing quiet at the far fence. I walked out with my coffee and leaned on the gate. The sun was just breaking above the ridge.

I saw it coming from the tree line. Took it for a stray dog at first. But no dog moves like that. No dog is that big. Its head was low and its back was broad and it moved slow.

As it came closer I saw it was a wolf. But not the kind you see on TV. This thing was the size of a damn horse. Gray. Thick. Powerful. Its paws kicked up dust and the cattle didn’t flinch. They watched it. Calm. Like they’d seen it before.

And I didn’t move either. That’s what I think about most now. I just stood there. Let it come.

It walked right up to the fence. Close enough to touch. I don’t know why I did it but I reached out and laid a hand on its fur.

It let me.

The coat was coarse. Warm. It stood there breathing. Heavy but not fast. Like it wasn’t worried about me or what I might do.

Then it turned.

It walked to the nearest calf and without sound or warning snapped its jaws around the neck. One quick jerk and the body dropped limp.

That broke the spell.

I pulled my pistol. Fired three rounds. Dust flew. The wolf didn’t even blink.

I ran to my truck and got my rifle from the rack. A big gun. Fired once. The sound cracked across the field.

The wolf turned to look at me.

It looked amused.

It dropped the calf. Turned. And walked off into the open land behind the pens.

I didn’t fire again. I just watched it go until the dust took it.

I followed the tracks. They were deep in the soft earth. Clear. Heavy. I followed them out into the field.

Then they stopped.

Just like that.

No blood. No trail. No drag marks.

A few feet ahead I saw something else. A single line of barefoot prints. Human. Walking away like nothing had happened.

I stood there for a long time. Didn’t call anyone. Didn’t tell my wife. Just walked back to the house and locked the door.

My grandfather was right. There are things out there that wear the shape of animals. But they’re not. Not really. I think they’re older than us. I think they remember when the world belonged to something else.

And sometimes they come back just to remind us.",4,1751583921.0,libraryofshadows,0,0.84,False

As per the subject, I’m about to have my 12th interview with a company tomorrow. 

At this point I have had 2 HR interviews, 3 coffee chats with 3 coffee chats with different directors, a case study, 2 jobs fits, 2 behavioural interviews, and have completed a 45 minute online assessment (total almost 2 full working days of just interviewing). 

Today I was asked if I would be available for the final interview on Tuesday. 

As much as I’m annoyed because they promised the last one was the final, after director chat number 1 they asked if I’d be interested in 2 other similar positions I.e. why I’ve met with 3. At the time of course, because the roles were literally identical just in different departments. He also shared that to avoid biases they also typically have 3-5 rounds of interviews with different people in the company. Now we’re at 12. 

This is where I come to ask for advice on what to do. My friends are saying walk away or that I’m just part of a social experiment to see how long I’ll keep saying yes. I on the other hand, as much as I’ve hated the amount of time and effort, have genuinely enjoyed talking to the interviewers and have had a lot (lol) of really good conversations with them. I’ll also add that this is a hybrid role, I can commute via train on in days to save miles on my vehicle plus it’s faster than me driving, benefits are wild and it’s $170k a year. I know it’s not all about money but between that and work life balance as being discussed, there are reasons why I’m still going through it. 

I don’t know Reddit, am I crazy? Am I part of a sick social experiment or should I confirm the ‘final’ interview?",28,1751583814.0,interviews,62,0.95,False

Im going to study at KU this fall, now i have to apply for dorms on Monday (Global House since im a graduate) and i want to know how much better the dorms are than gositels? the gositels i found are the same price or 50,000 won cheaper (including all utilities, AC, free coffee, ramen etc.) give or take and that amount is negligible when it comes to rent for me. People I know who went to Korea told me gositels are dirty and in bad conditions but the videos im seeing on kakaotalk from the landlord are fine, I also will ask my friend to check the rooms this or next week anyway. I just want to know why I would prioritize college dorms over gositels since i cant get guests over for example.

I am aware there is a chance im rejected from dorms but im assuming i got accepted and im going to live in a single room dorm. Moreover the gositel is IVYHOUSE if anyone knows it.

1lr3ipi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1lr3ipi/i_think_my_dad_is_going_to_die_from_cancer_soon/,I think my dad is going to die from cancer soon,"I am 14F and my dad (In his early to mid fifties), an amazing, funny, nice man had been diagnosed with cancer months ago. My sense of time isn't that great but I think that's right.  
  
  
It started off with the doctors doing scans and stuff because he had been having pains or something, it's hard for me to remember right now. Apparently one of the doctors read the scan wrong and there had been cancer in him but by the time another doctor found it, it had already been spreading to the other systems/areas of his body. He soon became easily sickened like motion sick from simply watching something fast on the TV. He could still walk on his own, but he had a cane my brother bought to help him sometimes if he needed it. Then eventually,  he was hardly able to walk anymore and had to have a wheelchair. It wasn't so bad back then because there was still a fighting chance for him. I remember us talking about my Youtube channel (which he had always inspired me to try Youtube since he could tell I absolutely loved watching others on there and would gush about it to him all the time) while he was in his first wheelchair, drinking coffee and looking out the window late at night. That's a memory I'm very fond of.   
  
  
Over the more recent few months, he's been getting worse. He uses the wheelchair all the time now, he can't go back to the bathroom by himself anymore, he can't eat actual food anymore so he has a feeding tube, he barely wants to get out of the bed, he's been spitting up medicines and whatever else a lot, throwing up, etc. He can't stand car rides because he gets sick now when he used to not be bothered by them at all. He's become very thin, scarily thin and has lost a lot of weight and he also can't talk clearly his voice is now a hoarse whisper. His hair had been falling out from chemo so he got it all buzzed off by my mom. Speaking of my mom, she's become his full-time caretaker/stay at home nurse since she can't leave him at home to go to work. She gets a little bit of money from it that doesn't grant as much as her job but it's a lot better than nothing and at least she doesn't have to worry about my dad because she'd be away from home. My oldest brother has also been very helpful. He's been going to work and making money the most. My other older brother had gotten fired from a false rumor so he's out of the count and for some reason won't find another job. I can't get a job myself but if I could I definitely would so I could help out more. 

My dad and I color together sometimes. I go upstairs to see him in his hospital bed and we color, talk about whatever he's watching on the bedroom TV, or I show him my most recent drawings. I wish I could stay up there in his room for longer at times but it's really hard to watch him like that especially now that I seriously think he is going to die from this. The reason why I think he's dying is because I went to Google (horrible idea btw) and looked up something that had happened a few times. One time, maybe a month or less ago, my dad had everyone upstairs and we were hugging him and all of that and for some reason his head hung to the side for a moment, and I honestly thought he died. Then my mom touched him and he came to. This happened again today from what I heard but this time I wasn't watching. Apparently this a common thing to  happen before death. I also read about other signs of upcoming death and it's really matching him. He's barely eating, not leaving the bed, he seems to be in pain often, he has unfortunately wet himself a few times and had one day had problems with possible diarrhea, his skin looks a bit blotchy but I'm not completely sure. His feet and legs sometimes bounce on their own in the bed too. I cried just a moment ago after reading about this.  
  
 It's terrible now knowing that my dad is for sure going to die. My mom has last minute hopes but my hopes are gone. I don't want to get my hopes up so I'm going to try and prepare myself but I know that it will still be devastating. My dad was my inspiration, he was the one I felt like I could talk to about my problems the easiest, he supported me, we told jokes, laughed, had good conversations, he said he was proud of me and all of us while in his hospital bed somewhat recently. That made me cry. It was so good to hear that he was proud of me.   
  
This summer has been pretty stressful, and my summer will be over in less than a month now. I don't know if I can go back to school if my dad passes or even if he's still here because I'm afraid of breaking down in public over this. Can I get some support here?
