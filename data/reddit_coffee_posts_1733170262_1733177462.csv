1h57bue,https://www.reddit.com/r/justpoetry/comments/1h57bue/the_faceless_man/,The Faceless Man,"In the Lowlands not twenty miles from the sea,
A citadel made from chocolate and beer protrudes from the canals,
I walk the streets a man-shaped vessel of stress and fatigue,
The city’s markets like a pan boiling over onto the stove,
Tourists spilling onto the streets from cafes and breweries all around,
Swimming in the pan would be more pleasurable than walking.
I seek refuge in the empty corner of a coffeehouse, 
I can’t see through the ever changing rainbow of beige so I choose not to try,
Leaning heavily on the table to stop it from rocking, the blood retreats from my elbows,
I stare into the pages below my chin but in my head I picture a faceless man,
Sat across from me we discuss the ugliness and beauty we are engulfed in,
After a final swig of coffee and a deep breath I brave the pan once again.
With a belly full of mussles, gin and beer, the hotel room door closes behind me,
The room cloaked in darkness, I read beneath the lamps mothering light,
The dreary hum from the air conditioning and Cohen perform a mesmerising duet,
In a half-drunken haze I stare into the black mirror of the television,
My whereabouts keep escaping me but the words I’m reading couldn’t be more clear,
Behind me that same faceless man lays on the bed, 
Flanked either side by Suzanne and Marianne they soon disappear,
A barrage of questions exit his mouth, I answer all as best I can,
How much should suffering cost?
Can I blow into your ear?
Can you give me a face?
He asks me what I want, I can’t think of an answer.

The other night i went out with my best friend to grab drinks and he was just hanging out at home but he never once texted me to ask how my night was or to ask if i made it home safe. He just called me the next morning. Its things like this that make me anxious but i dont know if its justified.

For a recent 3-day trip, I hired a dog sitter to watch my 8-month old puppy. On the third day, she left out a bottle of her meds on a coffee table, fell asleep (presumably from the meds), and woke up to find the dog had eaten all the pills and was throwing up. Instead of immediately calling us or taking the puppy to the vet, she waited several hours before determining that it was bad enough to warrant a vet visit. 

When she finally took the dog, the vets said the drugs were already coursing through her system and there wasn’t much they could do. Tragically, our puppy passed away from the strain these drugs put on her system. 

Now, the sitter is not only reducing to give back what we paid her to watch the dog, but is also refusing to pay the vet bills. I would love to know if there is anything I can do legally to go after this woman for the costs. Unfortunately this was done outside of any formal sitting service, and we live in Pittsburgh, PA. 

Thank you all in advance for any advice you can give.

I’m back 3 months later to say, AMA.","Lost my job, wife left shortly after. None of my pleasure centers were working, and all supplies were fully stocked, so I felt I needed to tear down and rebuild.

My breathing is beginning to accelerate and I can feel my vision sharpening as I type this, it’s intense. This one post now occupies a massive territory in my mind, and I’m going to have to figure out how to cede back that territory.

Full disclosure: I from 400-600mg of caffeine via coffee and energy drinks, to a post-breakfast and post-lunch cup of black tea. On work nights now, I may add a cup of green, but from there and in between it’s only white tea or chamomile. So I still get a healthy dose, but it isn’t ultra-processed, so I can’t just push a button and feel the rush, it’s gradual and easier to calibrate.

Biggest gain so far: I started a company. Why am I asking kids a decade younger than me for a job, when I used to do what their boss does? Nothing against the kids, go get em, y’all. But I used to love doing this work for free, how do I suddenly hate doing it for lots of money? Why am I so scared when I have enough to just hang out for a while?

Notable mention: When I drop something now, or spill something on me, or break a glass, the world no longer comes crashing down to pieces all around me for a moment. I no longer feel the impulse to tense up and react dramatically. I just watch the extent of the damage and respond accordingly. I might even put on a good album to clean to. Once I dropped some food while cooking, and I just cooked around it and then ate after while the water evaporated a little, then got to work.

I also journal constantly, everything is organized, and every time I have a deep conversation with someone now, they look at me like something is happening. A mom with two unruly kids at the store couldn’t stop smiling at me as I just walked around looking for something. I bought a painting reproduction for $50 and the owner invited me to he and his partner’s house party that night.

That should filter out a lot of questions. If I can calm down from writing this, I will be back to respond, otherwise I’ll respond when I can.

1h575vl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h575vl,“Failed” first date with a friend I’d known for a few months,"Hey everyone! The other night I (21M) went out with a girl (20F) who I had been friends with for a few months. When I first met her in the beginning of this year, I thought she was kinda cute but I was in a relationship at the time. When that one finally ended, I'd still her a few times a week, as I originally had, in a lounge designated to people in our major. It's a spot where people in our major do HW and stuff. We mostly did our own work but made conversation and found out we have a lot in common morally, politically, value-wise, and found out she lived on my street lol

Again, I didn’t think too much of it at the time and assumed we were just friends and being polite. Over time I realized that I liked her and I started to see that those friendly signs were actually signs of interest. She’d smile at me and laugh at all my jokes. Eventually, I decided why not and asked her out to Mass and dinner afterwards and she said yes! In that week leading up to the date we still chatted as normal.

Come date time I picked her up at her house. Her parents were interested in seeing who I was so I introduced myself and shook hands and all of that. We go to Mass and it was great! We sat very close to each other and our arms were touching the whole mass. There were times where she’d lean in to look at the missal or tap my shoulder to say something. I went for a hug for the sign of peace and she hugged me so tight lol. Dinner went well afterwards! After that, she asked if I wanted to go back to her house and have coffee and dessert with her parents and some family friends and I agreed! They all liked me and I think they even thought or assumed I was her bf lol.

When it was time to leave, I went for the hug and she latched on tight and told her I’d see her around campus. I texted her when I got home telling her I had a great time and went to bed. I woke up to the dreaded rejection text this morning (I’ll attach it in this post).

I was honestly really hurt by it (as all rejection stings). I know she’s busy since she’s applying for med school soon but we had talked about that (and she said that I’ve been so patient with her and thinks it would work out). It leads me to believe that she didn’t feel a spark or something. I was a little confused because we had known each other for several months and clearly she thought there was enough spark to agree to go out. I'm confused on how to proceed. I want to add I truly do like her as a friend and severing all connection would be awkward bc I see her around campus (and we both agreed to take a specific class together next semester). At the same time, I’m scared that holding on would result in false hope that she’ll change her mind. I had to resist the urge to try and “fight” it out and ask her to reconsider and all of that 😭 I’ve only been in this position once before and I severed the connection bc I found out the girl made fun of me to her friends for asking her out.

Here’s where it gets interesting:

 I saw her today in that shared lounge area. There was another girl in there too. She said hey guys and I responded hey but she only looked at the girl. I tried to make eye contact with her but she kept staring at her computer. Eventually I had to ask her a question (about something she agreed to help me with) and she responded pretty flat and still staring at her computer. In regards to the Christmas party text, she had mentioned well before this date she wasn’t very comfortable with going to it but later admitted that she’d go bc she wanted to spend time with me (hence why I asked if the plan was still on)

I think she may have been talking about me to the other girl by texting while I was in the room! This is a huge assumption but if true is incredibly childish. Eventually both leave the room for 15 mins and I leave to fill my bottle. I hear them climb up the stairs and heard the one girl say “that’s so weird!” Upon seeing me the two immediately shut up and looked tense. 

Eventually more people came in the library and she did end up looking at me when I told a story. I tried to give it back and smile but I’m pretty sure she looked away quickly. 

Idk if it’s a classic case of both people overthinking and a big misunderstanding (her thinking I’m mad and me thinking she’s mad). I can’t stand this. My closest friend said it doesn’t hurt to shoot a text and explain I’m not mad at her, but idk about this. I feel like I wouldn’t be giving her space and in addition to this I like it’s her job to reach out to me",1,1733176946.0,lostafriend,1,1.0,False

Last month, I finally graduated! This community has been amazing and I'm excited to share my own experience!

https://preview.redd.it/6emh5xbubi4e1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a27ced47289f1b8d1357ef0aef3080cf7cfb9e81



Just some context:

My husband and I's family are incredibly supportive, so they both offered to cover things for us. My family covered the bridal shower, ceremony, and reception. His family covered the rehearsal dinner and honeymoon. We covered the bachelor and bachelorette parties. Since I was only involved with ceremony and reception planning, I only know the exact budget for those events.

From the beginning, I did not want a wedding planner and took on the role of a wedding planner. Since I work from home, it was much more manageable researching, shopping, booking, and planning for my wedding.

All the DIY roles that we did were myself taking on the role of a wedding planner, my bridal party taking on the role of day-of coordinator, a family member taking on the role of MC, a few friends taking on the role of a live band, and my mother taking on the role of a florist. This worked exceptionally well for my wedding and my wedding party. Despite many of these roles being incredibly burdensome, everyone volunteered!

I know some say it brings luck, but it rained on my wedding day. Everything was indoors but I missed some outdoor shots in fear of my hair or dress getting ruined. It cleared up beautifully during the ceremony and reception, so it was actually something I didn't need to worry about.



Expenses that I did not include in my budget:

Bridal Shower: Estimated to cost $300-400. My mom hosted the shower at their house with picnic-styled snacks that our guests brought/made, pink decor and theme, and some silly bridal games.

Rehearsal Dinner: Estimated to cost $2,000. My husband's family hosted the dinner at a steakhouse. They prepurchased meals and drinks for the 30 guests to pick from.

Honeymoon: Estimated to cost $7,000. We went to Hawaii for 2 weeks! My husband's family covered travel with points and booked our hotels and major activities. My husband and I paid for food and other minor activities.

Bachelorette Party: Estimated to cost $1500. We went to Austin for a weekend! The cost was split among the bridesmaids (3). My MOH (sister) paid $200 for decor and other bridal surprises.

Bachelor Party: Estimated to cost $200. I decorated and prepped food at my husband's apartment for a drink and game night.

Bridesmaids Dress/Hair/Makeup: Estimated to cost $120 per dress. I selected a color and let my bridesmaids pick which style they wanted to wear. We used Azazie and it was super straightforward. I covered my bridesmaid's hair and MOH's hair and makeup for $400.

Groomsmens Tux: Estimated to cost $200 per tux rental. My husband's family covered the tux rental for all the groomsmen (3).

Bridal Jewelry: Estimated to cost $900. I didn't include it in my budget because it was more of a gift from my parents. We went to a local Indian jewelry store and purchased a pearl necklace and earring set.

Wedding Bands: Estimated to cost $1,100. We purchased my husband's 8mm, 10K gold band from Etsy for $750. My 2mm, 14K gold, lab diamond band was purchased from MollyJewelryUS for $350.



The ceremony and reception budget:

Recap:

Ceremony: The ceremony venue is stunning without any decor, so we only had 2 florals placed on stage. The candelabra (green plant) is 'historical' and was provided/maintained by the venue! Our officiant was a youth Pastor that we met at premarital counseling. He was amazing, funny, and wouldn't accept a dime. Our ceremony had a reception venue that they offered but it looked like a conference room, so we looked for other venues for the reception.

Reception: Our reception venue required in-house catering. Fortunately, their prices and quality were amazing. For $45-55 per head, we got appetizers for cocktail hour, the dinner meal, plated service, and all required tableware and dinnerware. We embellished the setup with plate chargers (rented $100), name cards (amazon), and florals that a decor vendor set up. Our meal options were herb-crusted chicken and filet medallions with a variety of sides. Activities we held during the reception were cocktail hour, speeches, songs from my bridesmaids, dinner, cake cutting, bouquet toss, and a sparkler exit. The reception lasted 4.5 hours with an additional .5 hour for guests to slowly leave. We had an hour to clean up, which my bridal party said was plenty of time since the venue's staff assisted.

Alcohol: My side of the guests drink little to nothing, so instead of having an open bar, I did a $1,000 bar tab. Drinks were $6-8 so that is roughly 120-150 drinks. I know many guests that had 6+ drinks so I honestly feel like the bar miscalculated something because we never hit the $1,000 bar tab; that or we somehow managed to have under 150 drinks. I made a cute drink menu for the bar on Canva for free.

Coffee Bar: My side of the guests are big coffee drinkers so we had a 2-hour coffee cart with hand-selected drinks. We hit our coffee drink tab of 75 drinks right around the 2-hour mark.

Florals: My mom purchased florals from an online wholesaler and put them together by hand. One of my bridesmaids came to help, but it took nearly an entire day. I would have just splurged on a florist, but my mom loves flowers and lives for this stuff. During my bouquet toss, I handed the bouquet that my mom made right back to her. It was a really sweet moment that I'm glad I did.

Cake: The vendor is a home baker who baked, delivered, and set up our cute little cake. It was a 6' and 8' cake, so we supplemented it with sheet cake from Walmart ($60). We saved a slice for our 1st anniversary.

Photography: We went with a corporate photography company (George Street). I had heard a lot of horror stories but was lucky enough to get to pick my photographer. He had previously taken pictures at the chapel venue and I loved his style.

Videography: I did not want the wedding filmed but my family was insistent because many of our international families weren't able to get a visa to attend the wedding. I gave in and don't really have much else to say. We get the video in another month so we will see if it was worth it.

Dress: I purchased my dress only 4 months before my wedding. Others scared me by saying wedding dress make/ship time was 6 months with another 3 months for altering. I got my Justin Alexander dress in 2 months (paid $100 for expedited shipping) and got it altered in 2 weeks. The body of the dress fit me perfectly, so the only alteration I had was a hem and bustle. We originally purchased a $200 'handmade' pearl veil from a boutique but returned it after realizing the exact same thing was on Amazon for $25. Both my veil and shoes were from Amazon.

Makeup/Hair: Normally, I do not wear makeup and initially was set on wearing none on my wedding day. Unfortunately, I gave in to peer pressure from everyone telling me I needed to wear makeup. Fortunately, the makeup and hair crew were great and did low-coverage makeup that still made me feel like myself. The artists did about 8 people's hair and makeup.

Organists: I went through 3 organists nearly a month before my wedding because they were all 80+ and facing health issues. Thankfully, they are all connected with eachother and always had recommendations for someone who could replace them.

Airbnb/Hotel: The Airbnb was for my bridesmaids and I. My family and extended family stayed at my parent's house. My husband's side stayed at a hotel in a hotel block. I believe guests paid for their own room. His family also paid for a rental car to shuttle those guests to the venues.

Sparkler Exit: We purchased 144 sparklers at a firework shack for $90. The owner gave us a discount since we bought the whole box. They were all 36' with a 4-minute burn time. They were easy to set up and gave us amazing pictures!

She then waited several hours before contacting anyone or taking the dog to the vet. My dog died alone and scared.

Se han dado cuenta de que ya no venden té Lipton Royal Ceylon - ""el negro""?

Es imposible encontrarlo, pregunté a reponedores del Unimarc (dónde pregunté) y me dijeron que haces meses no lo ven - ""bien raro"". Incluso el amarillo se ve re poco, cuando pregunté no había ningún té Lipton.

He buscado por internet pensando que es algo de esta región pero tampoco hay.

Empecé a averiguar que pasa y noté que desde Julio la empresa Lipton cambió el modelo de negocios en Chile cambiando distribuidor a Guital & Partners - antes distribuían ellos. Y curiosamente desde esa fecha que ya no se vé este té (que lleva décadas en venta en Chile).

Intenté enviando correos a Lipton internacional (en inglés) pero me refirieron a la distribuidora local, lo cuál es bien estúpido ya que si la distribuidora local no está cumpliendo no serviría de nada hablar con ellos si son los ""culpables"" de la perdida de mercado.

Todo esto hizo que probara productos diferentes y encontrara una opción a la falta de tal producto.

¿Alguien sabe o piensan que sería culpa del nuevo cambio?

On October 2, I tripped on an uneven sidewalk while on a run and banged my knee pretty hard (I think I hit the tibial tubercle?). I went to urgent care later that day because my wrist was super bothering me and the an x ray was done on my wrist to rule out a fracture (just a sprain) but no x ray was done on my knee. The doc inspected my knee and said it felt ok and range of motion was normal, so he didn't order an x ray. I had some swelling almost immediately after I fell in the area (https://imgur.com/a/S8aySx4) and it was quite sore for a week or so. While it no longer is painful to squat or move around, I can't put pressure on the area without pain. I have a toddler in the house which has made playtime frustrating since I can't crawl around with him since it hurts too bad to put pressure on that area. Weirdly, it doesn't really hurt if I push on the area but if I bump into a coffee table or something it does hurt. I've been trying to stretch and ice the area daily but that doesn't really seem to have made any difference. The area is also more prominent than my other leg now. My mother-in-law is a PT and I talked to her about it on the phone and she said she thinks it's just a bad bone bruise and my body probably laid down some extra bone which is why the area is more prominent.

Is it normal that it's still bothering me given that it's now been 2 months? Just annoying that I can't be on my knees. Anything I can do to get better?

I've been with my partner for nearly three years for 70% of that time it has been a beautiful relationship. We have spoken about marriage, kids, our values align, and we both fell strongly head over heels for each other.

Going into the relationship I was dating a sweetheart, a very kind and caring, thoughtful man who treated me so well it made me believe that all the past abusive relationships I had been in were a lesson to get to him. To a person who showed me what true, gentle love was like.  
Now our relationship is very heavily on the rocks.

There is so much to cover that I'm going to have to dot-point it, but happy to answer questions.

1st. We move in together. I come from an abusive household so this meant the world to me, also I dreamed about finding my person and living together. I was excited to apartment hunt, excited to furniture shop...the works.

It was nothing like what I imagined. A month prior my partner was grieving the loss of a family member one of which I was supportive and there for everything. except for one moment when it probably counted most. I have never lost someone, I was an anxious mess about how to support him right, I was googling everything so when he and his family walked in the door after I had been housesitting he asked me a question about a situation with my mother and I word vomited and I didn't stop because his family member kept asking questions. I know that was wrong and believe me when I say it was out of pure nervousness (I'm a babbler) My partner has always struggled to express his emotions so in the moment i thought thats what he wanted as he too asked questions, I thought I was giving a distraction but i have since heard and realized that I didn't give him the space he deserved to express his emotions in that moment.

As he explained to me, the moment was no longer about him, and thirty minutes later, I broke down crying because I knew I had blown it. From then on, our relationship completely changed.

During the funeral two incidents happened when I was accidentally hurt by him. Both times were when he was drunk and was awkward placement (think accidental head bumps) what terrified me was his reactions though. He was so resentful of me that when I cried and said my jaw hurt he laughed at me.  
I put this aside to grief, being drunk and his hurt feelings.  
Moving on to the apartment, he was snippy at me, and constantly put down my wants in searching for an apartment. example. I was ridiculous to want AC, I was a princess to want a place that had enough storage ... those types of comments. Fast forward to moving in he had zero interest in buying appliances we needed, he'd look at me like I was an idiot for wanting to buy a toaster...I  reminded him he eats toast every day and because it was something he wanted it was now okay.

I let it go and tossed it up to grieving but now looking back it was extremely obvious he didn't want to live with me. Around a month later he comes around, we go shopping and he enjoys decorating the apartment.

2. Issue two

We start to have arguments and our fighting style comes out. I'm anxious and he is avoidant. One time he made me wait 6 days to communicate feelings about an argument...I understand space but for all my anxious partners out there I feel you know how torurious this was on my mind and he knew it too.

This is where it arose that he thinks he set the relationship up wrong because in the beginning, he didn't express his feelings when he thought it would hurt me. We've had multiple conversations about expressing feelings and in my mind it was during arguments (this is important to remember) so I worked on it. I'm in therapy once a week for personal reasons and during those sessions I got advice, one of them being a pamphlet on how to healthily argue (this was after a nasty argument where I asked if he was thinking of breaking up with me and he didn't answer the question and give reassurance until he came home at 7pm.)

The pamphlet worked wonders.

I also want to reiderate if he ever brought an issue up, I did try to work on it, it maybe have been baby steps for some or huge differences for others but from my point of view, I have always worked on it.

During these conversations, arguments etc I always have to pry his feelings out. I ask questions, I validate his feelings, I try to explain my intent, I apologize. But still I am recieving that he can't express his feelings because it turns into a big thing. (if i cry, if I get upset, if I have any emotional recation it solidifies his believe that he can't express his emotions...so I felt I couldn't cry when I was upset in these conversations)

3. The fucking coworker.

When we started dating he had an argument with a female coworker and she made comments to allude that she could have been jealous (upset he doesn't hang out with her outside of work, complaining all he did was talk about (me), having a falling out when we made it official etc.) this woman does have a partner so it could have been jealous of losing a friend in some aspect.

Intuitively I knew something was a bit weird though and throughout all of this, my intuition has ALWAYS known when he is lying or hiding things about her.

Now these issues I'm about to tell started 6 months ago.

He came home with a business idea, for two weeks he worked on it until week three he made a passing comment that it was the female coworkers idea. I thought it was strange he didn't tell me he was going into business with her let alone that she was suddenly a close friend. He worked on it constantly which I admit I got jealous over because she did no work.

All I saw was a woman go to my partner with an idea and he went above and beyond for her while she sat back and did nothing. (which is a dynamic in their work relationship)

We talk about boundaries because I don't feel comfortable about her. those included no late-night meetings, no going to eachothers houses, they can work in public settings (no isolated one on one) Since moving he has changed how he gets to work and during this time period I asked him who gave him lifts from a certain area. he point blank looked at me and said X co worker Y coworker and somtimes Z coworker. (never the female)

So come to a moment where I pick up his phone to set a timer and i see messages from him to her asking for lifts. He never got anylifts from the male coworkers he mentioned, that was lie number one. I was more upset about the lie, in my mind I kept asking myself why lie? If its just a car ride why lie?

This is where his fear of ""upsetting me"" comes in.

We talk about it and i say I'm uncomfortable now that you've lied can you find another way to get to work.

he says yes.

he lies again.

he continues to get lifts every time, I also found out they go to lunch together, they go for walks during work, they get coffee etc. he never told me they were this close of friends and it felt like a betrayal, he agrees he handled it poorly and should have told me form the beginning of the relationship the manne rof their friendship.

This is a very tiring 6 months of me finding things he lied about (point blank to my face lies) but he solemnly swears he's not cheating that it's purely because he knows I don't like her and he doesn't want to hurt my feelings.

I forgave and forgave and forgave.

To the point where he agreed she was causing all of our arguments and he would back off.

Then I found he deleted messages between her for one ""innocent' conversation of ""friendly banter"". He said I could break up with him because that was horrible and he did it out of a place of panic when inebriated.

I forgave.

They do not see each other outside work. This is the only reason I believe he isn't cheating but lines have been crossed.

4. Comments.

When I get excited he tells me I'm 2 decimals too loud, so in a moment of me experiencing joy or excitement in our apartment, I have him sitting there telling me to adjust my volume and to lower my voice.

We have spoken about this I have explained it ruins the happy moment when someone is there telling you to be quiet, he refuses to budge even when I explained it hurt my feelings and its triggering after being raised in a house I was constantly told I was too loud in and to shut up.  
he also made a mean comment that I speak just to hear the sound of my own voice.

he also constantly snaps at me to ""just stop"". (example he put a hot iron on plastic I asked if he could move it, he didn't, so I got up to move it explaining the fire hazard and thats when he snapped.) to this day he thinks he didn't snap at me, even in the moment when I asked him not to speak to me rudely. Then it turned into how I try and orchestrate apologies from people and people don't owe me an apology.

5. The fight.

We were watching a tv show, he commented he was sleepy. I didn't think anything of it because we were bed, if he wanted to fall asleep he could. He wanted to turn the tv show off, I said I'm going to watch this ten minutes (I stayed awake for forty minutes for this one part) I will rewatch it with you tomorrow. I just want to watch this ten minutes and I'll go to sleep.

he got annoyed and made a comment saying I always get what I want.

Instantly turned off I closed the computer and went to bed when I woke up the next morning I said we needed to address last night. He expressed that I once again didn't allow him to have his feelings and that I have to read between the lines and pick up on his ques.

He expressed that he has issues expressing his feelings in the day to day, not just arguments which I did feel blindsided to.

Example: If he says he's sleepy, I have to ask if he wants to go to bed so he can say yes.

I said it's not my job to be monitoring your ques, it's up to you to express your needs and feelings and that clearly I'm not good at reading ques. He said it's a compatibility issue between us and spent the entire day questioning whether to break up with me or not.

I asked for a second chance, I said I would ask more questions, that I would work on my defensiveness etc.

I am not an angel, I do get defensive, I am emotional and I am sensitive and I do cry but I do feel he punishes me because i have my feelings and he feels he can't have his.

He decides to ""work on it."" We have an amazing healthy conversation about everything including my own feelings. this conversation came with a plan moving forward, eachothers needs etc. It was very healthy.

5. The party

A week later he goes out to a party (I don't get invited to the parties btw, that was spoken about in the conversation but I've yet be invited) He comes home drunk and tells me he feels bad for two partygoers, I ask why and he says he ranted to them.

he ranted about our relationship and his work stress to a random girl (he said random and then changed it to a girl he historically knew) and a random guy. This made me uncomfortable. I understand speaking to a friend, family, a therapist which he said he's going to get and still has not. But a random girl? You are opening up to a random girl and ranting to her about me? I felt so violated and betrayed, again.

6. Fork in the road

He said he spoke to her about how he is at a fork in the road of whether to stay with me or commit for life. I was perplexed I thought we decided to stay together and work on it? No. he is still in no mans land saying he doesn't know if he wants to stay committed.

This is where my anxiety has been eating away at me every single day.

I am with a partner who doesn't know if they want to be with me and it feels awful. he says he loves me deeply and that you can love someone and know it isn't going to work out. But as someone with an abandonment wound my mental health is declining every day. I'm a constant anxious mess, I'm constantly over thinking what I say or do around him and I am now tossing and turning on whether i want to be with someone after everything that has occurred. This is also absolutely me trying to protect myself.

I want the relationship back to when I had a partner who respect me, who loved me, who bought me flowers and who adored me. Not someone who doesn't know if they want to be with me.

I understand we have communication issues to work through, I am working on it. I'm in therapy, I have put my ego aside and have admitted to my wrong doings and have actively changed them.

I do love him and when he is great he is wonderful but it is truly fucking with my head knowing I'm going to have to wait possibly 6 months to know if he wants to stay with me when I'm prepared to forgive him for everything and work on it.

So please help me get out of my head a little and give me an outside perspective.

Because with all of this said and done, he is a kind man, he is smart and soft and caring and when he fully committedly loves me it is a beautiful love. He does still take me on dates, he does say he loves me, and we are GREAT together. We are supportive of one another. But all of this has snowballed so far my head is spinning.

I adore and love this man but I'm scared that might be blinding me slightly.

I'm also scared because I feel like even doing this is an invasion of privacy but i don't have anyone to talk to so please give me advice -- is it okay for him to be at a fork in the road? Or is he delaying the breakup?",2,1733176373.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

From the very first day we met, he seemed very smiley towards me, which might be because we share similar backgrounds. He’s quite reserved, while I tend to be more outgoing. I’m the type of person who shares food at work and offers snacks to everyone, and that’s how we started talking. Before that, we would just wave and smile at each other in the office. I took the initiative to start conversations, but at first, it was very platonic since I was just being my friendly self.

Eventually, he began coming by my desk to ask if I had lunch or to invite me to lunch, but unfortunately, we never managed to go together. However, we did commit to having coffee, and it turned out to be amazing. I enjoyed his company, and he seemed to stare a lot. He answered my questions, which felt like a good sign, but it frustrated me that when I asked about his weekend, he wouldn’t reciprocate by asking about mine at first. Despite this, he continued to come over to chat and would often suggest having coffee later in the day. He would always answer all my questions and open up. 

I’ve noticed that he opens up to me, yet he doesn’t inquire much about my personal life. He’s not a good communicator but will always initiate coffee in our canteen (free coffee at that). It could be that he has boundaries he doesn’t want to cross because after all we are colleagues. It’s now been over a month, he’s not asked for my number but continues to initiate coffee which often last 40-60 minutes. I like him and am interested, but I’m unsure if he feels the same way. His invitations for coffee could just be friendly gestures; however, I don’t see him doing this with others at work at all. I’m hesitant to read too much into it, but I hope he finds the courage to ask me to spend time outside of work if he’s interested. 

In the meantime, I'm uncertain about his feelings. He is quite open, yet also very reserved. I know that my personality tends to encourage even the quietest people to chat. Perhaps his coffee invitations are innocent, but I feel like his body language and smiles suggest otherwise. My interactions with him feel very different compared to another male colleague, which might be because I like him. I usually wouldn’t entertain the idea of liking someone at work, never have, but with him, it feels different. Maybe I’m overthinking it, and our frequent coffee or lunch invites are simply platonic because we get along well. What do you think?

1h56st4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h56st4/winter_of_97/,Winter of '97,"In 1997, I lived in a small town in rural America. I was a cop there, although, to be honest, the job wasn’t exactly what you’d call 'challenging.' Back then, there were no real crimes. It was a quiet town where everyone knew everyone, and the biggest concern seemed to be whether the bakery’s bread would arrive fresh before the snowstorm.

Many said being a cop in that place was the easiest job in the world, and I couldn’t disagree. In nearly five years on the job, I’d responded to maybe half a dozen calls, none of them serious. A few times, we were called to look for Mrs. Greta’s cat, which had the bad habit of sneaking into the neighbor’s shed. There was also the time old Bill decided to sleep in the middle of the street after a night out at the town’s only bar.

Patrols were almost monotonous. I spent most of my shift drinking coffee in the car and listening to the police radio, which rarely broadcasted anything other than static. Sometimes I felt like the station’s sole purpose was to offer the illusion of safety rather than to actually solve problems. Everything was peaceful—or so I thought.

That winter of 1997, something changed. Something that, to this day, makes me question everything I’ve lived and seen.

January 14, 1997. I remember that morning well. It started exactly the same as always. I woke up, had my coffee, and got ready for another day at the station. When I arrived, I greeted my colleagues with a nod, grabbed my notepad and radio, and prepared to 'patrol' the town. I didn’t expect anything different that day, just more hours of calm and silence.

I got into the patrol car and started my usual route. I drove past Mrs. Greta’s house, which looked peaceful. No sign of the cat. I continued down Main Street, where some kids were making the most of the winter with a snowball fight. I drove a bit further and stopped in front of the bakery, planning to grab a hot coffee before continuing my shift. I didn’t even get a chance to turn off the car. The static on the radio was interrupted by a voice that sounded more serious than usual:

***– Steve, you there?***  
***– Affirmative.***  
***– We’ve got an emergency. Mrs. Greta called again.***

I sighed. The cat again. I couldn’t help but crack a joke:  
  
***– Her cat’s gone missing again?***  
***– No.***  
***– Then what is it?***  
***– She said she saw a stranger entering the Smiths’ house. The kid’s home alone; his parents are at work.***

I switched off the radio without a second thought and hit the gas. I arrived at the scene in under a minute. As soon as I parked, my eyes went straight to the Smiths’ house. The front door was closed, and the upstairs windows were open, letting the cold wind in and causing the white curtains to flutter. It was an ordinary scene, almost tranquil, as if nothing could possibly be wrong. My eyes shifted to the neighboring house—Mrs. Greta’s. There she was, just as I’d imagined, peering through her window. Her face barely visible behind the curtain.

I stepped out of the car, adjusted my belt, and walked up to the Smiths’ front door. I stopped and called out:  
  
– ***Boy! You okay in there?***

My voice echoed loudly, but there was no response. I waited, watching the upstairs windows, but there was no movement. Just the sound of the wind and the fluttering curtains. I decided to move closer. I quickly scanned the surroundings, making sure there was nothing suspicious outside, then knocked on the door. The sound was sharp and dry in the morning silence. As soon as my hand left the wood, the door slowly creaked open, as if it had only been resting on the frame.

The door swung fully open, creaking until it hit its limit. Inside, the living room was completely dark and empty. The pale winter light filtered through the windows but didn’t do much to illuminate beyond the entrance. Everything seemed quiet—too quiet.

For the first time in my career as a cop, I felt genuine fear. Not the rational kind of fear you feel when faced with a clear danger, but something else entirely. A fear that came from the emptiness, from the lack of answers.

I was supposed to be brave. It was my job, after all. But there, standing in the doorway of that dark house, I felt paralyzed. A chilling cold swept over me, and I couldn’t tell if it was the wind blowing through the open windows or something deeper. With a firm hand, I drew my weapon and stepped inside.

I began searching each room on the ground floor, one by one. The kitchen was spotless, with dishes neatly arranged in the sink and a kettle on the stove. The dining room was just as tidy, chairs pushed neatly under the table as if the space hadn’t been used in days. Nothing out of place, nothing to explain the oppressive feeling that gnawed at me.

– ***Boy, this is the police! I’m coming upstairs!***

Then, I looked toward the staircase. It rose steeply, the white walls marked with small childlike scribbles—probably drawings from a younger age. I took a deep breath, adjusted my grip on the weapon, and began climbing, step by step.

At the top of the stairs, I found a narrow hallway. There were three doors. Two were completely closed, and the third was slightly ajar. Light spilled through the crack, casting a narrow beam onto the wooden floor.

I approached the partially open door, my steps slow and deliberate. The hallway seemed to stretch longer with each step, the sound of the floorboards creaking under my boots amplifying the tension in the air. My heart was pounding so loudly that I was certain anyone inside could hear it.

When I finally reached the door, I stopped. I took a deep breath, my hand trembling slightly as I pushed the door open with my fingertips. The hinges creaked softly, revealing the scene inside.

And that’s when I saw something I will never forget.

The boy was sprawled on the bed like a broken doll. His body was drenched in blood, so soaked that the deep red seemed to have merged with the fabric of the sheets. His eyes were wide open but lifeless, fixed on the ceiling with an expression of sheer terror, as if he had witnessed something his mind couldn’t comprehend before he died.

My gaze traveled to what remained of his right arm—or rather, what didn’t remain. It ended in a grotesque stump, the flesh torn and jagged, with pieces of muscle and bone exposed. It looked as though the limb had been ripped off, not cut. The brutality of the act was evident in the blood spattered across the walls and floor, as if something had taken pleasure in the carnage.

I was frozen, my eyes locked on the boy. Ten long seconds passed, an eternity where the world seemed to stop. But then, something in the corner of the room caught my attention. A shadow I hadn’t noticed before, moving slowly.

My heart raced as I turned my gaze. There, crouched in the corner, was a figure I hadn’t seen when I entered. It was thin, skeletal, its skin pale and sickly. Its head tilted unnaturally as it stared at me with glowing yellow eyes.

Before my mind could fully process what I was seeing, a sound reached my ears—a slow, wet chewing that made my stomach churn. That’s when I noticed what it was holding.

The boy’s arm.

The creature held it like a predator savoring its prey, its sharp teeth tearing through the flesh effortlessly as blood dripped from its chin, pooling on the floor. It didn’t stop chewing, but the most terrifying thing was that its eyes never left mine.

Suddenly, it stopped. It dropped the boy’s arm onto the floor with a wet thud, and silence enveloped the room. For a moment, it felt as though time had frozen. Then, it lunged at me with impossible speed.

Instinct took over. Despite the shock pounding in my head, my hand squeezed the trigger twice. I saw the bullets hit its chest.

It staggered, but its weight still crashed into me like a runaway train. The impact knocked me to the floor, my body slamming hard against the wooden boards. The creature fell on top of me, heavy and lifeless, carrying with it a stench of blood, rotting flesh, and something I couldn’t identify.

My breath was ragged, and for a moment, I thought it was still alive. But it didn’t move. I pushed its body off me and scrambled away, my hands trembling as I grabbed the radio clipped to my belt.

– ***This is Officer Steve! I need backup... now!***

After that, everything became a blur. I can’t recall all the details clearly. Just flashes: the red and blue lights of the patrol cars reflecting off the snow, paramedics carrying the boy’s body out on a stretcher covered with a white sheet. And that thing... that thing they took out of the room.

I don’t know what happened to it. I don’t know where they took it or what they claimed it was. And to be honest, I’m not even sure if that thing was human. The shape, the smell, the way it moved... All of it defied any logical explanation I could offer.  
  
Time passed, but the memories remained. They never left me, not for a single moment. I went back to the station in the following days, but something inside me had changed. The sound of the radio, the weight of the gun in its holster, even the uniform I wore - all of it felt suffocating.  
A few weeks later, I resigned. I couldn’t bear to wear that uniform anymore; I couldn’t stand stepping into that patrol car again. I ended up moving to New York, where I could lose myself in the crowds and try to forget.  
  
Today, I’m 47 years old. Two decades have passed since that cold morning, and I’m still in therapy. Every week, I sit across from a therapist and relive every detail of that day, trying to make sense of what happened, trying to convince myself that maybe I imagined things—that the creature in the room wasn’t real.  
But I know it was. The smell, the sound, the cold touch of its body as it fell on me... That wasn’t something my mind could create.  
  
And even now, when I wake up in the middle of the night, sometimes I still feel those eyes watching me in the darkness.",3,1733176049.0,nosleep,0,0.71,False

Currently I'm 15w4d and I'm a first time mom. I am 29 years old.

This will be grand baby number 5 for my in-laws but the first grand baby for my mother. My mom is super excited, but she's also irritated about certain things (and is drive me crazy during the holiday)

My mom is a school teacher and I am due May 22nd. She would still have 2 weeks left of her teaching job the school year and I live out of state. For some freakish reason, she keeps asking if I would consider having the baby in HER state where SHE lives so SHE could be there. Absolutely not. If she really wants to be there, she can communicate with her school and arrange a sub, but honestly I don't mind her not being there. 

My mom has also placed a large deposit on a trip out of the country for the first 2 weeks of June. She didn't get insurance on it and payed the deposit 2 days before I announced. She was upset I didn't tell her sooner so she could plan accordingly. I told her to go on her trip but that she'd need to wait to make sure she wasn't sick when she got home and she got annoyed. 

Okay last thing. She hasn't been pregnant in 25 years and she is constantly jumping down my throat over things that the doctor has told me are okay. I took a Tylenol in front of her and she literally screamed ""STOP NO THE BABY!"" in a very busy restaurant. She didn't believe me when I explained to her that it's fine and I had to pull up my mychart stuff and message the NP for her to lay off. She was also upset that I was taking baby aspirin for pre-eclampsia. She didn't believe me and called someone she knows that is currently pregnant to confirm if it's true. She gave me a ton of crap for having a cup of coffee because she didn't have coffee when she had me but she had it with my brother and ""just look at him.""..... he has an anxiety disorder caused by severe PTSD from events that are totally not relevant. 

My mother has also teased, ""I can't wait to tell you all the things you need to be doing.""

Keep in mind that all of these statements occurred within a 72 hour period. 

Okay rant over. Thank god my husband and I live out of state. ",35,1733175508.0,pregnant,12,1.0,False

From the very first day we met, he seemed very smiley towards me, which might be because we share similar backgrounds. He’s quite reserved, while I tend to be more outgoing. I’m the type of person who shares food at work and offers snacks to everyone, and that’s how we started talking. Before that, we would just wave and smile at each other in the office. I took the initiative to start conversations, but at first, it was very platonic since I was just being my friendly self.

Eventually, he began coming by my desk to ask if I had lunch or to invite me to lunch, but unfortunately, we never managed to go together. However, we did commit to having coffee, and it turned out to be amazing. I enjoyed his company, and he seemed to stare a lot. He answered my questions, which felt like a good sign, but it frustrated me that when I asked about his weekend, he wouldn’t reciprocate by asking about mine at first. Despite this, he continued to come over to chat and would often suggest having coffee later in the day. He would always answer all my questions and open up. 

I’ve noticed that he opens up to me, yet he doesn’t inquire much about my personal life. He’s not a good communicator but will always initiate coffee in our canteen (free coffee at that). It could be that he has boundaries he doesn’t want to cross because after all we are colleagues. It’s now been over a month, he’s not asked for my number but continues to initiate coffee which often last 40-60 minutes. I like him and am interested, but I’m unsure if he feels the same way. His invitations for coffee could just be friendly gestures; however, I don’t see him doing this with others at work at all. I’m hesitant to read too much into it, but I hope he finds the courage to ask me to spend time outside of work if he’s interested. 

In the meantime, I'm uncertain about his feelings. He is quite open, yet also very reserved. I know that my personality tends to encourage even the quietest people to chat. Perhaps his coffee invitations are innocent, but I feel like his body language and smiles suggest otherwise. My interactions with him feel very different compared to another male colleague, which might be because I like him. I usually wouldn’t entertain the idea of liking someone at work, never have, but with him, it feels different. Maybe I’m overthinking it, and our frequent coffee or lunch invites are simply platonic because we get along well. What do you think?

Long time lurking, first post.
I have been making espresso for about a year . I have a flair 2 and a timemore sculptor 64s.

Currently I'm getting awesome results for espresso using beans from a local brewery called cooks corner.
(Smithville NJ)
They are marked ""Italian espresso""
I love the taste, the body, the texture.

My question is mainly about quality of coffee and how much good coffee for espresso translates to other types like pour over or French press.
I'm pretty new to this, and have a hard time deciphering past good or bad. I see a lot of you guys describing coffee as butter, or acidic, earthy.
I can't quite put what I do and don't like into words.
I know I like my Italian espresso when I make an espresso. I'm not crazy about it in pour over and can't put my finger on why.

Reading in the pour over group, they mentioned a similar looking bean being to greasy, I wanted to get your opinions. Look to oily? And what roast level would you consider these? Medium? Medium dark?

PART 2,"I didn't think I'd be posting a part 2 to this, but something happened over the weekend that has left me feeling numb, stupid, and quite angry.

Also thank you for all the comments on my first post. I have done a lot of thinking over the last week, and together with the events over the weekend, I have come to accept this man was never my friend. I feel like I've been monumentally stupid.

Sometimes we just need to move on.

On Saturday I went to a craft fair where I bumped into my ex-friend's partner. We've met a few times and get along well, so we went for coffee. She remarked she wasn't good company at the minute, after everything that had happened. 

Long story short, she'd been contacted by someone her partner works with, who informed her he was having an affair with a married colleague. She confronted him, he admitted it, she kicked him out and is now buying him out of the mortgage. 

She has now been approached by others from within their friend group with information about him cheating on her with multiple women over several years.

This has all happened in the weeks since he ghosted me, which coincides with the beginning of his latest affair. 

This was not the man I became best friends with. I don't think that man even exists. The fwb thing he tried me with was sickening, but this is a whole other level. 

I feel totally duped, but on the other hand I feel no loss. I regret the time and energy I put into the friendship, but I can no longer regret it ending. It's like a switch has been flipped.

This whole experience has been both bizarre and hurtful. But if nothing else, this has given me firm closure. I have also decided to take some time away from the hobby we share. I have other friends there I'm in contact with, so if he ever stops going I'll happily go back. But right now I never want to see or hear from him again.

He wasn’t a bad person, just one of those people who thought their job title meant they didn’t have to do any of the small, basic stuff—like cleaning up after themselves.

Jeff would leave his dirty coffee mug on the counter, scatter crumbs everywhere, and throw his lunch containers in the sink for someone else to deal with. The worst part? He insisted on holding our team meetings in the breakroom, where we’d have to sit around his disgusting mess. Picture this: you’re trying to talk through a big project, and right next to you is a half-eaten bagel and a mug with dried coffee sludge.

Everyone hated it, but Jeff never took the hints. Anytime someone mentioned the mess, he’d laugh it off with, “Hey, I’m busy managing! You guys can handle the rest.”

So, I decided to handle it—just not in the way he expected.

Jeff had this thing about his protein shakes. Every morning, like clockwork, he’d grab one from the fridge and go on and on about how they were the key to his “fitness goals.” It was the only thing in the breakroom he actually cared about.

One day, after cleaning up yet another pile of his crumbs, I had an idea. I wrote a note and stuck it on the fridge, right next to where he kept his shakes. It said:

“Attention: Due to recent cleanliness issues, we cannot guarantee that all surfaces in the breakroom are sanitary. Please clean up after yourself to ensure a safe environment for all.”

It wasn’t a lie—the place was gross, thanks to him—but I knew it would get into his head. And it did.

The next morning, I watched from my desk as Jeff stared at the note. He hesitated, grabbed his shake, and then… put it back. A few minutes later, I heard him asking around about who left the note. No one said a word.

When the mess continued, I upped the ante. I printed another note:

“NOTICE: Breakroom areas have shown signs of bacterial contamination. Clean up after yourself to avoid risking personal items.”

This time, I watched as Jeff took out his protein shake, stared at it, and then threw it in the trash. He looked genuinely panicked.

The next day, for the first time in months, Jeff actually cleaned up after himself. I’m talking wiped-down counters, no crumbs, no dirty mugs—he even washed his stupid Tupperware. It was like watching a miracle.

When someone jokingly asked him why he was suddenly so tidy, he said, “Well, I don’t want to get sick. You can’t be too careful.”

Sure, Jeff probably thought he was saving his own skin, but honestly? It saved the rest of us from dealing with his mess. Now our breakroom meetings don’t feel like we’re sitting in a dumpster.

TL;DR: My lazy boss never cleaned up his mess in the breakroom, so I put up some “health warnings” near his favorite protein shakes. He started cleaning immediately.",233,1733174905.0,pettyrevenge,22,0.96,False

Part of the position included handling all the parking spot rentals prior to when these would have been on a simple computer screen. They were folders...thousands of them...updated manually with who paid what, whose check didn't clear, blah blah blah. I worked for an eastern New Jersey dude named Frank who was a narcissistic jerk on his nice days and an absolutely heinous individual on his bad days. 

He's thirsty for coffee one day shortly after I returned from lunch, so he picks up his cup and taps it on his desk (annoying, I know), ""Torrie, Coffee!"" I am on my way to the back room with about 2 feet of files, so I call out, ""I'll be right with you, Frank!"" I take two steps, and he retaps, ""Torrie, COFFEE!!"" I walk back the seven steps to his office to show him my heavy load, thinking he might not have heard me. ""I'll be right with you, Frank!"" I turn and take one step out of his office: ""TORRIE!!"" Three loud bangs on the desk, ""COFFEE!!! NOWWW!!!!!"" 

I turn back into his office, pull my arms out from under the files, and drop about 300 folders of data. Contents fly everywhere. I step over the pile, grab his cup, ""Coming right up!"" I said as sweetly as possible. After filling his cup and dumping about a half cup of sugar in it, I brought the syrupy goop back to him and slam it on his desk, sickly sweet black coffee spilling on his appointment calendar, his white shirt and blue tie, and across his leather chair.

While he was sputtering, I walked back to my desk, made a quick phone call to my lunch appointment and accepted the job they had offered me that I was deliberating. I was working for the new company 22 minutes later.

I ran into one of my former coworkers a few months later, and she told me he had already been through four others in the position. Apparently, nobody wants to get coffee for jerks anymore.",286,1733174415.0,MaliciousCompliance,8,0.97,False

Women want a dominant (not domineering), confident man who knows what he likes. A man who stands by how he sees the world. A man who doesn't cave under pressure.

That's what makes women wet.

It comes across in teasing, where he knows the truth and she's a silly little girl for believing anything else. It's fun for women to feel that way. Women (and some men) feel deeply submissive. They hide it yet they want to submit to the right man. They want to ""be made"" to submit, which doesn't mean force or violence or anything illegal. You make people submit by holding strong to your perspective and confidently showing the other person why they're wrong.

Shit tests are a great example. Shit tests are all about her trying to push you off balance, and you hopefully not being affected by it. You pass, she gets wet. You fail, she rejects you.

It's also true in every part of cold approach. You're confident that you're sexy, she pushes back, you hold firm. You're confident that she'll stop and talk to you, she pushes back, you hold firm. You're confident that she wants to make plans / give her number / get coffee right now, she pushes back, you hold firm.

Every time you push your worldview, she gets more into *subspace* (submissive head space), and she likes it. Every time you hold firm you give her reasons to want you.

If you never push your worldview, all she has is your looks or status. Push and give her more reason to like you.",2,1733174408.0,PickUpArtist,1,1.0,False

My favourite keyboard ever was an old Corsair Strafe which I've had to replace with a Ducky One 2 tkl due to a coffee spill accident (oops). I've been wanting to replace my ducky for a while now and I decided to order the K70 core tkl since I enjoyed a previous model so much.

I find the keyboard to be really nice looking, smooth and its sound is pleasing to me as well but something about bottoming out the keys feels off to me somehow. Is the travel distance any shorter than the usual mechanical keyboard on this model? I swear it feels like the space bar on my ducky travels a bit further down when pressing it for example, which in comparison makes the K70 core feel err ""restrictive""? I'm trying to figure out if this is a me  problem and its just a getting used to it angle or if that's just how this model is built and I should return it. Maybe the floating key structure has something to do with it?

Thank you inn advance for the help; I'm a bit sad because I find the keyboard to be really beautiful on my desk but I don't think I can get used to this difference in how it feels.",1,1733174360.0,Corsair,0,1.0,False
1h563sr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sambretzmann/comments/1h563sr/what_is_local_seo/,What is Local SEO?,"If your business serves a local area, *local SEO* can make a huge difference in attracting customers. Unlike national SEO, which targets broad audiences, local SEO focuses on reaching people nearby, increasing visibility and driving foot traffic to your physical location.

**What Makes Local SEO Different?**

• **Location-Specific Keywords:** Target searches like “plumber in Atlanta” or “coffee shop near me.”

• **Google Business Profile:** Optimize and manage your listing to stand out in map searches.

• **Local Directories & Reviews:** Build trust with backlinks and glowing customer feedback.

• **Proximity Signals:** Stay relevant and visible in your local community.

**Why It’s Essential for Local Businesses**

• Capture mobile and “near me” searches.

• Boost visibility on Google Maps and local search results.

• Build trust and credibility through reviews and local mentions.

Whether you’re running a coffee shop or a service-based business, local SEO is key to connecting with nearby customers and staying ahead of the competition.

I know there is a lot of looking for help and desperately wanting to get better in this sub, so I thought I would just add something that made me feel better after struggling with GAD, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. 

After dealing with my own fair share of experience with anxiety, whilst also studying psychology and reading tons of books about how to find relief, mental health, and herbalism, I wanted to recommend some things that have helped me.

I just wanted to first recommend L-theanine to anyone struggling with anxiety: this won’t cure you but it definitely takes the edge off of things. 

Now here is a short compiled list of recommendations:

1. L-theanine
2. Lemon balm
3. GABA
4. Kava
5. Yogi stress relief tea or any stress relief tea
6. EXERCISE!!! (Whether it’s a short walk or just watching a simple growwithjo vid on YouTube)
7. Valerian Root
8. Getting adequate sleep! (Most people overestimate how much sleep they are actually getting - strive for 7-10 hours nightly.)
9. Exposure therapy (visualization or actually doing it in person).
10. Cognitive behavioral therapy (recognizing distorted thoughts and changing it to more neutral, logical, or positive thoughts).
11. Soaking up the sun.
12. Bath with Epsom salts.
13. Taking magnesium glycinate.
14. Ensuring adequate iron, D3, and B12 levels.
15. Yearly bloodwork to ease any hypochondriac tendencies + ensure anxiety isn’t caused by anything biological.
16. Cut out smoking/vaping. 
17. Balance or cut out any drinking habits.
18. Journaling or ranting on voice recorder.
19. Cry it out.
20. Going to therapy online or in person.
21. Ranting to chatgpt about your situation or get advice.
22. Guided meditations.
23. Yoga/stretching.
24. Visualizing good scenarios to change your emotions.
25. Essential oil diffuser (lavender or eucalyptus).
26. Practicing self care (doing a hair or face mask, tending to your brows, etc..)
27. Declutter room and clothes.
28. Creating a stable routine.
29. Getting a massage.
30. EFT tapping.
31. EMDR therapy.
32. Reading books to understand mental health better or just a regular book to feel good.
33. Listening to inspiring podcasts.
34. Socializing with friends.
35. NOT isolating yourself.
36. Less caffeine (I like to use half decaf and half caffeinated for my coffee).
37. Staying hydrated.

These are just a few things off the top of mind right now, but as I begin to learn more and figure out what works for me I realized something. Whatever you do, it always goes back to the basics - sleep, meditate, exercise, eat well, no drugs.

I wish you the best of luck and hoped some of my suggestions helped. Please look at things in life you need to cut out and things to add to it! Blessings. 🩶",1,1733174303.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

She has fibromyalgia and other autoimmune illnesses. Generally though out the year I help her a little, but she does mostly everything on her own. 

She had foot surgery 3 weeks ago and I have mostly been looking after her. I really tried my best to help her with everything I could, from prepping breakfast, getting her ready to shower and other day to day tasks. But lately it has been feeling a bit overwhelming as she would make demands and want me to do things quickly as possible, even though I was trying. We had a smaller argument the previous week about how I would seem frustrated and angry when giving her food or water for coffee, but I honestly was just feeling tired. Like I always do, I just apologise and moved on.

For some quick background to each of the items in todays fight:

Yoghurt- She really likes to have yoghurt and fruit but can only eat half a yoghurt tub. Due to GIT issues, she doesn’t eat it the next day and this often leads to it getting wasted unless I occasionally try to finish it.

Water- We had a water repair 2 weeks ago and didn’t have any running water. We had to use bottled water in the kettle. She says that the drinks taste much nicer than using tap water and as a result we have been using bottled water in the kettle since. 

Today’s fight- I forgot to write yoghurt on the grocery list and therefore we didn’t have new yogurt today. I told her that there wasn’t any besides the half one from yesterday. Then I accidentally filled the kettle with tap water rather than the bottle water and thats when she exploded. 

She went on to ask why I am being cruel and depriving her of these items when she is sick. I tried to de escalate the situation by saying I’m sorry and I wasn’t trying to deprive her. But it still escalated.

It escalated into her saying I’m the worst child ever and that I am a b*tch who just treats her like sh*t. It went into how she regrets doing anything for me and that I’m selfish. 

For everything I have done today it is like I’m damned if I do, damned if I don’t. I still offer my help, she won’t take it. Then it’s a problem when she has to do the things that I always helped her with, on her own. Now I had just announced myself to take my items from our shared bathroom and she says “you didn’t even ask me how I had a bath and if I struggled” even though I just entered, then told me to F off.

To be completely honest, I feel like the AH. She has really done a lot for me over the years and sometimes maybe I do forget this. And in retrospect I feel like I shouldn’t have brought up her wasting things like water and yoghurt, but I don’t know how to feel anymore and think an objective third party can help me see some perspective.

Thank you in advance

1h55yqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1h55yqt/lm_studio_and_rag_usage/,LM Studio and RAG usage,"Hi!

I'm using LM studio and a variety of models for aid during writing of a story.

Tend to give the context around them in the first post, what's happened in short and similar, along with character descriptions etc, and have the AI imagine being in a room without doors, getting interviewed by god, and discussing the part of the story I want to discuss.

Example from my most recent attempt:

>You are the protagonist, Lily.  
You find yourself in a large room without any doors or windows.  
You see a square table in the middle of the room with one chair on each side, in one of those chairs I sit.  
You sit down in the other chair.  
You recognize me as your creator.

This seems to work perfectly well for stopping the AI from getting distracted and going off on tangents, so works perfectly to discuss story beats etc, and it is very helpful when the character shows signs of confusion, as that is a potential plot or worldbuilding hole that I ought to look into. It's also insanely interesting to talk to characters I've willed into being, I've had a lot of fun just having casual chats with characters, highly recommended, even if you're a writer that don't want to use AI for assistance for anything, just talking straight to the character is a very rewarding experience as a story writer, even if just for your own pleasure. 

AI, as it exists today, can't write stories for shit, but good god almighty, are they amazing at reading them and living them out in a limited context.

As a story draws out, the surrounding context grows A LOT, and it quickly becomes a problem context wise, which is expected. To address this problem I understand that I have two potential solutions:

* Setup for a fine tuning, and get a lot of coffee as shit happens
* Setup a RAG that the LLM can reference throughout the dicussions

For what I consider obvious reasons, I'd rather not do fine tuning right now, as that sounds really time and effort intensive, so that leaves RAG, which it seems LM Studio supports just fine. Just make a markdown file and feed it to the app. No biggie, just copy the last opening user prompt, pretty it up a bit with markdown to set titles, subtitles etc, and off to the races.

On the first few responses, this seems to work great. The character wakes up in the empty room, sits down on a chair by the table and answers maybe the first two questions perfectly within my expectations, but then it all falls apart, and the AI starts halucinating like there's no tomorrow, it don't seem to draw anything at all from the document anymore and just starts making up things left and right. This doesn't happen, at least not that quickly, when I just dump everything into the first prompt in LM Studio, so I assume it just queried the document during my first question and figured it didn't need to do that anymore, though it hasn't gotten any of the information in the document besides what it needed for those initial prompts.

Am I doing something wrong here? Or is this just a poor usecase for RAGs? Or maybe, do I need to adjust some settings or something?

I don't think the model really counts into this, but just in case:

I known this girl 27 F for about 6 months in my work place. At first we connected quickly through work, even tho we are only at the same company but different teams. We shared some quick chats and all at first, was looking at her just like another co-worker nothing more. But with the time I started to think maybe there something here, I should try to know her more to get a better idea. So I started asking her for lunch together, at the break. In the first tries she would tell me why didn't you tell me sooner, I have something planned with my team and stuff, she seemed sincere to me at least. After 2-3 tries, she accepted, I just had to plan it in advance, so we went to this restaurant that she recommended that she told me she used to go with her teams. We had a really nice talk got to know her more, about his vision of life and stuff. For me everything seemed great we laughed and all and ofc since I invited I paid, she was grateful and all and said to me next time I will take care of it.

After this first 'date' if you call it, I got a nice idea and was quite into it so I wanted another one. But this time it was quite difficult, everytime there seemed to be something blocking it (and for your information she's busy or at least that's what she says, she works week-ends and during the week! so for a chance to be together during her free time, it's only during the week) So everytime I proposed something there was an excuse (helping his sister, going with friends/team, tired), I believe the excuses were valid but maybe a bit too much. So finally she said ok this time, we went again to lunch a place that I did choose. It was great once again, got to know her more about what she wants in life, and it seemed to have aligned with what I want too, I paid for the thing again, she was thankful. Then we went to a park, we sit there and I gave her a little surprise, a little funny potato that holds a paper telling her I believe in you. It was for her birthday, she told me about it late cause she was on vacation during that time so I had to do a little thing. With the little potato a note that tells her happy birthday, and funny little message and hope this year will be as beautiful as you, from her face she quite liked this little surprise, she couldn't stop laughing and thanking me, it seemed sincere. Somewhere in that moment I knew thag I wanted her, so I couldn't hold it and asked her for a little coffee later in the day after work, which she easily said yes (first try unusual).
So going in the evening, same day, I was almost ready to share my feelings for her. So we ended up being there for some hours talking about vacations, family a lot of stuff and she seemed interested, asking questions, not letting the conversation die. She talked about wanting something serious this time with a guy and was not interested in playing games anymore, which I hardly agreed with her, she also shared some bad experiences from the past that let her skeptical. Then it started getting late, I had to walk with her to the train station, I wanted to express what I feel but couldn't, didn't find the courage and the right moment. Before leaving she couldn't stop thanking me for everything, just before leaving she gave me a kiss on the cheek, it was a first, since we weren't too touchy before. I was a bit mad to not be able to express what I had to, but said it's fine I'm gonna have other chances.

So again, I want to see her. Like you see, the initiative almost everytime come from me. After struggling to find availability on her side she finally said yes to a diner, for me this was the occasion to tell her how I feel.

So I planned the whole evening, we went to a walk to a funfair/markets, It was amazing we played some games had good laughs even went to ferris wheel, we took some pictures together up top, once again I paid for everything even tho she proposed but I couldn't let her, and I'm more than fine with it, I'm even grateful. After it we went to this restaurant, we ate super well, maybe we ordered a bit too much was a bit expensive but it was nice I didn't care since I had a great time talking and laughing with her, but in my head I was stuck waiting for my moment to release what I had inside. Idk, I was like stunned or blocked, and got frustrated, didn't find the right moment to turn the conversation. So once again I accompany her to the train station, she was super thankful this time, kiss on the cheeks and then she left. This time I was super mad at myself for not finding the right moment to tell her how I feel, I freaking hated myself. Right when we got separated, she sent me a message to thank me again for everything, so here I said I have to do it now. So I responded with I had so much fun today I hope you did as much as me, and then I wrote that I wanted to tell her something today, but just didn't get the chance and the right moment to do so, so I wanted to clarify something with you, and that is I appreciate you a lot, you are a kind and beautiful girl with good values, I think I have special feeling for you, and would like to discuss it with you, what do you think? That was my response. 

Since then I didn't get an answer, that's been 3 days, she received the message but wasn't on read or anything. Usually she takes sometime to respond since she's busy (she works week-ends), but this time felt like forever. 

For me I feel like this is my last push, I don't want to double down anymore, my message seemed super clear to me, and yes she received it. So I've been waiting since, thinking maybe the silence itself is an answer? But what I can't find in my head is a reason for her to say no, since everything seemed to be near perfect when we were together, when we are not, via messages everything seems to be slow and souless...

So here is my long story, I hope I didn't lose you midway, sorry for my english, it is not my first language. But most importantly I want your advice on this situation, is there something that I'm missing? Did wrong? Should I just move on (even tho it's not that simple since I feel super invedted in this)? Thank you

See title. The wall measures 58.5"" wide and is marked in green on the floorplan. The wall is in a transition space between the dine-in area of the kitchen and the living room so it seems like committing to one would make it feel like that space bleeds into the other. We had considered a coffee bar but it doesn't have convenient access to kitchen sink, which isn't a dealbreaker but I suppose would feel out of place. Also wary of any wide or deep furniture pieces given proximity to the circle dine-in table.

So for context, me and my now-ex girlfriend broke up this year, at the end of March. It was a hard time, especially since she got with someone else around July. There's lots of details, but this isn't why I'm making this post. The important part is that we kept in touch until relatively recently, then we stopped talking, and then she contacted me again.

The reason she contacted me was to tell me that one of my work colleagues (we work in different departments but we share the same building and our offices are right next to each other), contacted her. She did this because at some point after the breakup I more or less jokingly asked her to tell me if anyone she knows is my friend hits on her, and I guess she kept that in mind.

Anyways, she told me, and obviously I felt betrayed, ESPECIALLY since I confided in this guy after the breakup and even mentioned that if one of my friends were to hit on her now, it'd be a shit thing to do.

But here's the truly fucked up part:

They met up for coffee a little while after the first message he sent, after he insisted, and she made it clear that she doesn't want anything beyond meeting for one coffee (she showed me the conversation). He agreed, said he wouldn't try anything, but of course once they actually met he immediately started hitting on her. One of the first things he did once they met was trash-talk me and lie to her, saying that I called her a bunch of shit like ""whore"" and whatnot, which, no, I fucking didn't, even if the break-up sucked, and even if I am over it, I still care for her.

She even mentioned how it was not cool of him to hit on her even tho me and him are friends, to which he said ""Well since I'm talking to you now, we are not friends"", which is an absolutely insane thing to say.

Anyways, they talked, had their coffee, but once it was time to leave, he kept getting more aggressive with his advances towards her, which she didn't want and just wanted to leave, and so this man actually pulled a ""I'm gonna leave you alone if you kiss me"", and then went on to forcefully kiss her, which, to me sounds like straight up fucking sexual assault.

She called me to tell me about this, and told me how after he finally left, he completely shifted his demeanor through messages and started calling her ""pathetic"" and a bunch of other shit, started telling her how he knows what time she gets off work and other creepy ass details that he should NOT know.

So here I am, after the call with her, using all my willpower to not go and bend this dude's knees backwards. I am by no means a violent person, I never fought anyone, but my god, I never wanted to break someone's jaw this bad. The only reason he isn't swallowing his teeth right now while having a bat up his ass is because she asked me not to do anything because he is getting sent to his hometown in like two weeks and because she's scared he might do something if I say anything.

TL;DR - Work colleagues I thought was a friend hit on my ex, she told me he hit on her, they met for one coffee because she didn't think he was a fucking psychopath, and he pretty much sexually assaulted her.",4,1733173245.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.83,False

We haven't known each other too long but we become friends quickly. I like her as more than that. I do think we flirt sometimes. I do anyway but even her.

Now today I asked her if she wanted to go on coffee date tomorrow. She said yes. To me it sounds like a romantic date. Not that anything is bound to happen but to me it means there's at least some interest there from her side to in more than friendship.

My best friend however said that it could also be seen as platonic question. Especially since we are both girls and we usually hang out as friends.

I guess my question is if a friend asked you to go on a coffee date, is that a real date or just a hangout?


Either way, what's a good way to bring attentions across without making the other person uncomfortable. I want it to be absolutely straight forward but also not uncomfortable like I'd rather not just kiss someone if I am not 200% sure on intentions.",1,1733173194.0,dating,12,1.0,False

1h55h8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLGBT/comments/1h55h8p/should_i_tell_a_girl_that_my_friend_is_gay_to/,Should I tell a girl that my friend is gay to help her move on from him? ,"I know that title sounds like a horrible teen B movie plot and this is a doozy so hear me out. 

I asked about this on an advice sub and got literally opposite answers and I was up all night trying to wrestle with this. It’s really really wearing me down and I can’t let my friend spiral over this anymore either.

Long story short: my friend, 28M is gay, or at least that’s what he has confided in me. He may be on a spectrum but it’s very clear he prefers men and wants to date men. For his entire life until now he’s tried to pretend he’s straight, and unfortunately he has a child with his ex girlfriend, so everyone just assumes he is straight. 

Everyone, including 24F, his next door neighbor. She also assumed he was straight when they first met, and instantly became obsessed with him. My friend had a horrible childhood and so he has this compulsion I guess you would call it, not to upset anyone because as a kid he was physically hurt a lot by the adults in his life. So, when she began flirting, he started flirting back. He said she seemed like she’d get angry if he didn’t, and based on how he described her I feel like she love bombed him and he panicked. I don’t know how deeply he flirted, he told me it was never sexual and it was mostly just stuff like agreeing that she was beautiful, and he admitted to me in tears that he nigh have “agreed” that they were soulmates. I know my friend— if you had an intense demeanor and you told him “I think you’re blonde” he would run a hand through his dark hair and say “yes you’re right! I’m the blondest guy there ever was!” He’s been in therapy and he was getting so much better at not panicking and agreeing, but this situation seems to have brought him back to square one. 

Apparently he met this girl a few times on accident when she was out walking her dog, but he also said there were a few times he walked out of his apartment to meet her because he felt like he “had to”. He said he was just panicking the entire time, he told me today that he was sure she would catch on that he was uncomfortable, avoiding eye contact, very stiff. 

Now onto the girl. 24F, my little brother knows her somewhat and kind of warned me hey, this chick is psycho, but only me, my friend, and my girlfriend know about her obsession with my friend. Like I said she lives next door to my friend. She was selling something on Fb marketplace a while back, before I knew anything about this situation, so my girlfriend and I went to pick it up. We were at her apartment, she left for a sec to let the dog pee and that’s when we saw the shrine. 

She has pictures of my friend printed out and taped onto a bulletin board, yes, like a crazy person. Anything public, she has. She has written to my friend every day like months and months worth of post it’s from her and then his response, but it’s not his response, it’s what she WISHES he would say. She has printed out readings from psychics off Etsy who tell her what she wants to hear, she has cards that they claim are what my friend wants to tell her. And then her vibrator just laying there. It made me feel so sick, I got a pit in my stomach that hasn’t gone away. I get the feeling my friend feels that so much worse. 

When she came back inside and I was paying her I thought she would be ashamed we saw the shrine, girlfriend and I were in shock and I made a joke about it. She laughed and just said that she and my friend were in love. She said that it’s been months since she’s talked to him, but she KNOWS he will come back, and he’s just avoiding her because they are “twin flames” and that’s what he’s supposed to do. There’s more in my original post but basically she showed us the “psychic technique” she uses to channel my friend where she just sits quietly and then writes down some bullshit she wishes he’d say, like him saying she’s the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen and that he cranks his hog to her nightly (this was one of the fake things she wrote down). She truly believes this is him communicating with her through the spirit world or whatever. 

After that my girlfriend and I left both freaked out. So I message my friend and ask him 1) why he’s been not replying to me and if he’s okay and 2) if he knew this girl. 

My friend came to my dads house where I’m living right now and he was a wreck. He was the worst I’ve ever seen him mentally and physically, pulling his hair out and crying and he threw up when we were talking too. He said he hasn’t been keeping down meals and everything runs through him, I remember that from when we were teens and know that happens to me when I’m truly anxious out of my mind. I hate to see my buddy like this. 

He told me he is tormented by guilt without any relief, because he played along. He said he could have never stopped to talk to her and pet her dog, he could have avoided her after that initial encounter, but instead he said he felt like he HAD to interact with her. He described her behavior and I immediately thought to myself that she love bombed him, but instead of making him like her back, it made him terrified and feel like he had to agree or he’d get hurt. 

Yeah, my friend could have, should have, whatever, but I told him to let that go, all we can do is focus on right now. I asked him what he wanted to do, the way I see it there’s getting a restraining order or something, or there’s moving and hoping that she eventually tires herself out and moves onto someone new.

Big reaction to the restraining order, absolutely not. He sobbed and begged me not to make him do that. He is not white and doesn’t like anything to do with court, I’m not trying to get political im just relaying his stance. 

He asked ME if I would go and tell this girl that he is gay. He asked me to do this because he said maybe she will stop pining for me if she finds out the truth. But then he quickly backtracked and said he doesn’t know if she’d spiral into depression over that information. He is EXTREMELY concerned with her spiraling or harming herself. Like that sends him into a very deep panic. 

I told him the other option is he can move in with my girlfriend or me and my dad for the time being, and then we can just hope that the girl let’s go eventually. The problem with that is that he can’t let go of his guilt. He keeps remembering things he said to her in conversations, how he suggested he liked her back without really realizing it, and he even claims he convinced her to quit her job by saying he can’t stand people who work at coffee shops— he told me he doesn’t think that and it just slipped out, but she’s since quit her job at the cafe and admitted she’s worried about paying her bills now and has to find something else. As he was telling me this, he started punching his leg really hard. I had to full on grab his hand. 

He thinks he ruined this girls life, that it’s his fault she’s obsessed with him even though he hasn’t spoken to her in months and has avoided her. 

I don’t think it’s his fault, but I can see how his mind would twist it into that. Worst of all, he said that during the few months the two of them would occasionally see each other, he started trying to make himself straight. My friend… has a history with this. His parents used to hurt him for suspecting he was gay and now he admitted to me that he has begun forcing himself to watch straight porn and hurting himself if he has gay thoughts. His logic at the time was if he could just force himself straight then maybe he could appease this girl… this girl who he admits he doesn’t even like that way. I felt fucking horrible when I heard that. We already know he tried to force himself to be straight with his ex and it didn’t work. 

I wanted to take him to the hospital at first but he’s had bad experiences there so I get that. I got him to stay at my girlfriend and I’s apartment. I’m away caring for my dad but my girlfriend lets me know how he is doing; he trusts her and is ok with her knowing about the situation. Since moving in with her he has resumed therapy and expressed that he wants to try letting himself be gay and date men but that after this situation he doesn’t think he deserves happiness. 

He brought up me telling the girl that he’s gay again, and wondered if it might bring her closure, or if it would make her spiral. I cant edit that far up but one thing related to that was when we were at the girls apartment my girlfriend made a comment about my friend dating women “at this point in time” — I told my friend after and he was fine she said this. But when my girlfriend suggested that he was bi, the girl flipped out and begged us to tell her if he was gay, and that’s why we left because we didn’t know what to say, if we should put him, and the situation was so weird and volatile. Maybe we should have just told her, but then what? Would she have let us leave? Would she have gone after my friend or as he fears, hurt herself? 

He said he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do. I’m unsure of what to do as well. But I want to help him handle this. He’s a resilient guy who has been dealt the shittiest hand of everyone I know. I have to help him. 

****TLDR****
My friend 28M is gay, but does have a baby with his ex girlfriend. He had a horrible childhood and has a ton of trauma from it that causes him to freeze up and do whatever it takes to appease people. I’ve seen it firsthand since we were teens. His next door neighbor is a very intense girl 24F who became obsessed with him after the two of them met outside when she was walking her dog. My friend whipped himself up onto a frenzy thinking he owed this girl something and unfortunately he encouraged her antics by continually interacting with her and not disagreeing with her when she said things like telling him she and him were twin spirits and soul mates. 

Me and my girlfriend went to 24Fs apartment for marketplace before we knew anything about this. That’s when we saw her shrine to my friend where she has paid psychics to tell her what she wants to hear. When my girlfriend vaguely suggested that my friend is bi, this girl freaked out and seemed to panic. Then she assured herself that he isn’t gay, because the spirits told her. My friend is a wreck. He is living with my girlfriend for now but he torments himself with guilt. He has tried to punish himself for being gay, and expressed to me that he feels like he doesn’t deserve to be happy because he was a coward and let himself continue to indulge her delusions.

He will not get a restraining order, that’s out, and he said his therapist agrees. His therapist agreed that he can either tell her the truth or he can move on and just let the situation go. But he expressed to me over and over that the thing that makes him su****l is that he cannot deal with the fact that she quit her job over him, that she pines after him daily. He feels guilty, and though he’s expressed a desire to live and be his true self, he doesn’t see a way forward. 

At first he asked me to tell this girl that he’s gay, so that maybe she could get closure, but then he backtracked and said maybe I shouldn’t do that because it might cause her to spiral and hurt herself.

I don’t know what to do. It seems like neither choice is a good one and I don’t have anyone in real life I can ask. I asked last night on a sub and got complete polar opposite answers from only 2 people and neither of them fully made sense to me so I’m desperately trying again. I need perspective on this because this is the first time I’ve had to deal with something heavy like this and I want to show up for my friend.

My father lost his leg in 2020. That's a funny story by itself. I happened to return his call when he was stuck in the woods hunting several states away and could tell something was wrong. I saved his life by calling to get him airlifted out of there. As a result, he lost his leg, spent almost a year in the rehab hospital.

Before then, every Christmas he'd make me go shopping with him. He wanted me to help him pick out stuff, then take all his gifts home and wrap them for him. It's gotten worse since he lost his leg. He's combative, abusive, yells at me for my driving. 

This man has never in my 40 years of life bought me a gift that he put any thought into. And every Christmas it's been the same. He will put heaps of thought and money into gifts for my little brother who he worships, but never for me. The most he did for me was one of those Walmart Starbucks mugs with a coffee packet in it. I don't drink coffee and the gift was a recycle he got from someone else.

My dad just took my brother on a month long hunting trip with my brother with a Wildlife Outfitter. This cost tons of money and time and he made sure to pick a place my brother wanted to go. Had no clue until he got back yesterday and sent me the text ""we need to talk about when you're taking me shopping"".

The problem is, if I don't do it, my brother gets enraged at me and refuses to speak to my mom, who I caregive for. (To be clear, my mom is great and supportive, but I don't want her to suffer through not seeing her son, especially since out other brother died on Christmas Eve.) And since she doesn't have long to live, I feel like i'm just stuck in this pattern of catering to my dad until she's not with me anymore.

I feel really broken. This year feels different. Caregiving and long-term verbal abuse/neglect from my dad coupled with the homophobia from my brother has just sapped me of everything.

Not really sure how to keep going. I don't have any real family because all I have is my mom. My brother's basically my dad's dupe and refuses to help me with the caregiving I've had to do. I haven't been able to make time for a partner, I'm financially in shambles taking care of her while he lives in a 400k house and goes on six vacations a year. When I ask for help, he just says ""I have a family, you don't"".

[First Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/1gyxym2/update_on_first_compost_pile/)

It's been about 10 days since I updated and expanded on my original compost pile.  I added about 100lbs of additional shredded and whole leaves from the Original to the First Update plus regular additions of coffee grounds from a local coffee shop.  Total greens weight is \~ 50lbs.  This is preserving a 3:1 ratio of C/N (browns (leaves)/greens (coffee grounds, alfalfa pellets, and urine)).  After sitting for 10 days most of the pile was warmer than ambient air temp (30F) with pockets of active compost (120F).  I wanted it hotter so I turned and reshaped the pile making it taller.  I also added a bit more greens (coffee grounds), added a splash of water.  After being exposed to cold air for a few hours the reconstructed pile cooled to \~70F throughout. In 24 hours the pile has heated up to \~115F throughout (excepting the top and edges). I'll probably turn it again tomorrow and continue every other day for a couple of weeks. Once done with this approach I'll let it rest through the winter and spring and be ready to work for planting by fall of 2025.

But he seemed to be a Very genuine guy. The he  asked me out on second date over ice cream. And we met over ice cream date and then he asked me my name when I insisted. Lol . Post this he got vanished for 15 days saying he is going to his home town for Navratri and he had to prepone the plan coz his dad is not well. But he switched off his location on bumble and he didn’t communicate me at all for those 12-15 days. But the he again came back apologised saying he was caught up with dads health and hospitalisation. He again asked me out over dinner and we went for dinner and we drank and danced. And he seemed to be genuinely all into me during dance. So I got carried away a bit. He then asked me to come over at his place for dinner as we both were hungry. So I ate then when I insisted to leave. He told me lets have a dessert and then I will drop u back. Post this suddenly he came and started kissing me and I somehow pushed him away and told him i want to go home. i then booked a cab and he came to my place to drop me and next moment I know we were making out in my bedroom. He stayed back till Sunday evening and we were cuddling and making out in between. He then left to home on Sunday evening saying he has to shower and charge his phone and again he came back on Sunday late night and he stayed back at my place we had sex that night and he left again Monday morning and again came back on the same night. Then for Diwali I had my flight on Tuesday so I asked him to leave on Tuesday morning . I was scrolling Instagram and found a girl had tagged him in vacation pictures so I sent him the post asking who is this girl. And then he didnt reply to me for 2 hours. I scrolled that girls profile and found they both went to Egypt same duration when he claimed to be taking care of his dad. And I went all panicky. He after lot of drama accept that he is dating this girl. I want to know what red flags I ignored as he seemed genuine showing interest added me in his instagram. Bringing me flowers and everything.

The big question: Can you find a meaningful relationship on a gay dating app? Yes, you can—I’ve personally had two long-term relationships that started on Grindr. But let’s not kid ourselves: this isn’t the reality for 85% of the men using these apps.

Here’s the deal. For many men, the freedom to pursue sex with other men without the societal pressures of babies, commitment, or long-term responsibility has sent basic humanity packing. We’re living in a “sex first, ask questions much later” era. And yes, I’ve had my share of consensual flings—I’m not here to shame anyone. But now that I’m on the other side of those experiences, I’m here to share what I’ve learned, so you can avoid unnecessary heartbreak and chaos.

# The Language of Apps: Decoding the Grind

Let’s talk about what happens when you log on. The moment you open one of these apps, you're greeted with messages like “Sup,” “Wassup,” or “You looking?” It’s like someone handed you a treasure map written in invisible ink and said, “Figure it out.” These apps have created their own shorthand dictionary, and if you don’t speak the language, you’re in for frustration. Gone are the days of “Hello, how are you?” Full sentences have been replaced by grunts reminiscent of cavemen.

Now, before you think I’m just here to roast men, let me clarify. I love men—their bodies, their confidence, their energy. Nothing excites me more than the thrill of connection, especially with the right bottom. (Yes, I’m a Top, in case you were wondering.) But even I’ve heard the question from men new to this world: “Why is everyone speaking in riddles?”

# The App Dictionary: What They’re Really Saying

1. **""Sup""** – I’m alive, you’re alive. Now what?
2. **""You looking?""** – Are you ready for intimacy, or are you just here to browse?
3. **""You clean?""** – A blunt question about STD status. Just answer yes or no.
4. **""You hung?""** – Do you meet my physical criteria for a hookup?
5. **""Not eHarmony.""** – Don’t expect meaningful questions or deep conversation here.

Why does it feel like every app conversation is a speed round on a game show where the prize is almost always disappointment? Because most users are looking for the payoff without the investment. If you’re not prepared to transact, many of these interactions will feel hollow.

Imagine walking into a bookstore. You see someone reading a book, and instead of asking about the author, you blurt out, “So, you wanna take this to the stockroom?” If that’s your thing, great! But if you’re looking for something more meaningful, you might need a different approach—or a different venue.

# 20 Tips for Navigating Dating Apps (Without Losing Your Mind)

1. **Have Clear Intentions** – Know whether you want a date, a friend, or a fling.
2. **Set Boundaries** – You don’t owe anyone explicit photos or instant intimacy.
3. **Learn the Lingo** – Understand common phrases, but don’t tolerate disrespect.
4. **Be Honest in Your Profile** – Save everyone time by stating your intentions clearly.
5. **Look for Effort** – If someone can’t form a proper sentence, they likely won’t put effort into a relationship.
6. **Don’t Take It Personally** – Shallow interactions are about them, not you.
7. **Be Mindful of Safety** – Always meet in public for the first in-person interaction.
8. **Don’t Feed the Trolls** – Block negative users and move on.
9. **Ask Questions** – Real connections require real conversations.
10. **Take Breaks** – Apps can be overwhelming. Step away when needed.
11. **Trust Your Instincts** – If something feels off, trust your gut.
12. **Be Patient** – Real connections take time.
13. **Know When to Walk Away** – Some interactions aren’t worth pursuing.
14. **Use Photos Wisely** – Showcase your personality, not just your body.
15. **Engage Meaningfully** – A thoughtful question can go a long way.
16. **Respect Boundaries** – Yours and others—it’s a two-way street.
17. **Stay Authentic** – Don’t pretend to be someone you’re not for attention.
18. **Watch for Red Flags** – If their energy feels off, it probably is.
19. **Keep Perspective** – Apps are tools, not reflections of your worth.
20. **Know When to Log Off** – The best connections sometimes happen offline.

# The Bottom Line (Pun Intended)

Whether you’re swiping on Tinder, tapping on Grindr, or scrolling through Scruff, remember this: dating apps are tools, not solutions. They can feel like a circus, complete with clowns and chaos, but with clarity and purpose, you can navigate them successfully.

And let’s get real. Love doesn’t just fall from the sky. If you’re here for a fling, great—you’ll find that in spades. But if you’re on these apps looking for love, remember this: you’re not hiring someone for the job of being your life partner. You’re conducting interviews.

At the end of the day, dating—yes, even online—is a process of discovery. Be intentional, be discerning, and don’t settle for breadcrumbs when you deserve the whole cake. Most importantly, don’t forget to have fun along the way.

So in a spirit of engagement send me your comments regarding these questions please. I'm interested in hearing from other men about the experiences they have had on these apps:

* **What has been your most surprising or unexpected experience using a dating app like Grindr, Scruff, or Tinder? Did it lead to something meaningful or leave you scratching your head?**
* **How do you personally navigate the challenges of cryptic communication on these apps? Have you found any strategies that help you decode the messages or set clear expectations?**
* **If you’ve had success in finding a meaningful connection through a dating app, what advice would you give to someone feeling frustrated or disillusioned with the process?**

Happy Dating!

Yes, I use A.I. in my writing—because why not take advantage of a tool that helps with formatting, grammar, and making sure my words make sense in context? But let’s be clear: A.I. doesn’t write for me; it works *for* me, like spellcheck on steroids.

I just recently bought a used Sage Barista Pro. It is from second hand, slightly used around 3-4 years old machine. Everything is working just fine but when tuning in I was trying to tune in the grinder.. I went as low as 1 for internal burr and 1 for the setting outside the machine. With this setting I feel like the shot is still pulling way to fast, around 7 seconds of pre infusion and maximum 20 seconds total (with preinfusion) with 18g of coffee for double espresso.

Could anyone tell me if it is normal or that the burr could be damaged or worn out after 4 years? I tried x different types of beans, currently running freshly dark roasted beans that were roasted on 27.11. it is supposed to be Columbia beans but I tried Brazil, Uruguay and it all have similar ending with Soury taste. The temperature on the machine is set up as a middle setting, and to be honest I have no idea what else I could check. Is there anything else I could to double check before spending money on new grinder for the machine? (I know that I can't expect miracles from the machine but still, as I read the internet 1 / 1 is not a normal setting)

1h55cn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h55cn6/confused_about_a_situationship_long_story_heeelp/,Confused about a situationship (long story heeelp),"Hello everyone, 28 M here I want to share my story and get advice from you guys

I known this girl 27 F for about 6 months in my work place. At first we connected quickly through work, even tho we are only at the same company but different teams. We shared some quick chats and all at first, was looking at her just like another co-worker nothing more. But with the time I started to think maybe there something here, I should try to know her more to get a better idea. So I started asking her for lunch together, at the break. In the first tries she would tell me why didn't you tell me sooner, I have something planned with my team and stuff, she seemed sincere to me at least. After 2-3 tries, she accepted, I just had to plan it in advance, so we went to this restaurant that she recommended that she told me she used to go with her teams. We had a really nice talk got to know her more, about his vision of life and stuff. For me everything seemed great we laughed and all and ofc since I invited I paid, she was grateful and all and said to me next time I will take care of it.

After this first 'date' if you call it, I got a nice idea and was quite into it so I wanted another one. But this time it was quite difficult, everytime there seemed to be something blocking it (and for your information she's busy or at least that's what she says, she works week-ends and during the week! so for a chance to be together during her free time, it's only during the week) So everytime I proposed something there was an excuse (helping his sister, going with friends/team, tired), I believe the excuses were valid but maybe a bit too much. So finally she said ok this time, we went again to lunch a place that I did choose. It was great once again, got to know her more about what she wants in life, and it seemed to have aligned with what I want too, I paid for the thing again, she was thankful. Then we went to a park, we sit there and I gave her a little surprise, a little funny potato that holds a paper telling her I believe in you. It was for her birthday, she told me about it late cause she was on vacation during that time so I had to do a little thing. With the little potato a note that tells her happy birthday, and funny little message and hope this year will be as beautiful as you, from her face she quite liked this little surprise, she couldn't stop laughing and thanking me, it seemed sincere. Somewhere in that moment I knew thag I wanted her, so I couldn't hold it and asked her for a little coffee later in the day after work, which she easily said yes (first try unusual).
So going in the evening, same day, I was almost ready to share my feelings for her. So we ended up being there for some hours talking about vacations, family a lot of stuff and she seemed interested, asking questions, not letting the conversation die. She talked about wanting something serious this time with a guy and was not interested in playing games anymore, which I hardly agreed with her, she also shared some bad experiences from the past that let her skeptical. Then it started getting late, I had to walk with her to the train station, I wanted to express what I feel but couldn't, didn't find the courage and the right moment. Before leaving she couldn't stop thanking me for everything, just before leaving she gave me a kiss on the cheek, it was a first, since we weren't too touchy before. I was a bit mad to not be able to express what I had to, but said it's fine I'm gonna have other chances.

So again, I want to see her. Like you see, the initiative almost everytime come from me. After struggling to find availability on her side she finally said yes to a diner, for me this was the occasion to tell her how I feel.

So I planned the whole evening, we went to a walk to a funfair/markets, It was amazing we played some games had good laughs even went to ferris wheel, we took some pictures together up top, once again I paid for everything even tho she proposed but I couldn't let her, and I'm more than fine with it, I'm even grateful. After it we went to this restaurant, we ate super well, maybe we ordered a bit too much was a bit expensive but it was nice I didn't care since I had a great time talking and laughing with her, but in my head I was stuck waiting for my moment to release what I had inside. Idk, I was like stunned or blocked, and got frustrated, didn't find the right moment to turn the conversation. So once again I accompany her to the train station, she was super thankful this time, kiss on the cheeks and then she left. This time I was super mad at myself for not finding the right moment to tell her how I feel, I freaking hated myself. Right when we got separated, she sent me a message to thank me again for everything, so here I said I have to do it now. So I responded with I had so much fun today I hope you did as much as me, and then I wrote that I wanted to tell her something today, but just didn't get the chance and the right moment to do so, so I wanted to clarify something with you, and that is I appreciate you a lot, you are a kind and beautiful girl with good values, I think I have special feeling for you, and would like to discuss it with you, what do you think? That was my response. 

Since then I didn't get an answer, that's been 3 days, she received the message but wasn't on read or anything. Usually she takes sometime to respond since she's busy (she works week-ends), but this time felt like forever. 

For me I feel like this is my last push, I don't want to double down anymore, my message seemed super clear to me, and yes she received it. So I've been waiting since, thinking maybe the silence itself is an answer? But what I can't find in my head is a reason for her to say no, since everything seemed to be near perfect when we were together, when we are not, via messages everything seems to be slow and souless...

So here is my long story, I hope I didn't lose you midway, sorry for my english, it is not my first language. But most importantly I want your advice on this situation, is there something that I'm missing? Did wrong? Should I just move on (even tho it's not that simple since I feel super invedted in this)?

The restaurant life is tough, I get it. 

Same thing at coffee shops; they put in THE WORST chairs anymore, to keep you from hanging out with your laptop all day. When people want to work from Starbucks, the advice is usually to ""pay"" for your spot by ordering roughly one drink an hour (and at that point, surely a coworking space costs the same?) 

There are no bars in my town, but there are about a thousand breweries with craft beer and mediocre food. Here, you're meant to stay for hours (though I can't help but feel bad for the kids attempting to amuse themselves with cornhole while their parents daydrink). 

Back in the day, the clubs I went to had shot girls circulating constantly to make sure you spent money and didnt just dance.

The explanation for all these less than ideal experiences is that businesses have to meet their overheads-- they either have to charge a lot and let you linger, or charge a little but chivvy you out the door, or, if they can manage it, charge a lot AND maximize turn. 

And yet, on movies and TV shows, from travellers and locals, I hear about UK pubs where people just...hang out and drink for not-absurd sums of money. These pubs are apparently everywhere, fairly small, with respectible but not fancy draft offerings, and a whole raft of regulars. 

So either the overheads are low (maybe you don't need much staff if you let people linger over a pint) or people are spending much more per ticket than it seems. 

But it seems like the big ticket items must still exist-- rent, insurance, property taxes--- and the alcohol aspect limits the hours of operation (or maybe not; perhaps it's legal to serve beer at 9am).

Anyone able to offer any insight?

Vegan and vegetarian diets are consistently associated with anxiety and depression despite their other health benefits. As someone who already struggles with major depression, I know I benefit a lot from some animal protein in my diet. The amount of protein I've had this week was much more than normal though.

I also fasted for 3 days to increased BDNF before Thanksgiving. I'm not sure how much that helped because results from that aren't immediate. It probably didn't hurt. Other ways to generate BDNF are sunlight, high intensity exercises, and polyphenols (plants). Coffee cherry supplements is one of the more studied supplements for increasing BDNF.

I consume under 1000 calories in meals a day. I haven’t been overly tracking,  but my go-to meals are 900 or 400 calories per the whole thing. I often go half on the 900 calorie item. It’s often the only thing I eat in a day. Sometimes when I’m at work, I buy a small can of cashews and munch on those during my 15 minute break. 

Sometimes on my way to work, I have a turkey bacon sammich from a local Tim’s, but that’s only 550 calories. That paired with my other 400 calories item doesn’t seem like a lot to me. But sometimes even then, that’s all I eat. 

I have treats occasionally. Like a cookie or a slice of cake when it’s baked. But it’s not a daily thing. I don’t go out of my way to buy these things.

I have two to three cups of coffee a day, with under two teaspoons of sugar per cup. 

I drink alcohol seldom. I bought one pack of 12 this year.

I buy a jug of apple juice once every two months or so for a treat. It’s usually gone in a week.

I drink about one cup of milk per day. 

My watch says I walk 3-7km a day. It varies and fluctuates. I go for walks at least half the days in a week, and I do stretches or workouts at home the other half. 

I was taking hormonal birth control and Effexor, but inconsistently. Those are my primary suspects; going to speak to a doctor about it.

I do have fibromyalgia and tend to sleep 8-14 hours a day. I also suspect I have IBS as I bloat up and in pain whenever I eat or drink something. I’ve been tested for the more serious diseases as a kid and nothing came up.

I’ve tested negative for diabetes. Multiple times.  

My heart rate and VO2max have been improving consistently and nicely, so I know my activity has been counting.

He’s applying for jobs for me now; doing the mind-numbing, repetitive task that I just couldn’t anymore. 

I don’t know what I did to deserve this kind of love. But I’m sitting here, crying softly. I just... don't deserve this man! 😩",297,1733172184.0,adhdwomen,26,1.0,False
1h55746,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dryfasting/comments/1h55746/christmas_new_years_fast/,Christmas & New Year's fast,"Hey, guys,

I'm (34F) a somewhat experienced faster (multiple 4-day dry fasts and 7-day water fasts in the past 10 years), but I always feel useless while fasting (even with electrolytes), which restricts my ability to do longer fasts while working.

Friends and family didn't find it too strange that I wanted to ""retreat"" from Dec 20th until Jan 1st to take care of my mental and physical health because this one was a particularly difficult year for me.

I'm posting here mainly to try and find fasting partners and give them time to prepare.

Here is the plan so far, but suggestions are welcome:

`- Mon 16th to Thu 19th - Preparation (nutrition, hydration)`

`- Thu 19th, 8pm to Sun 22nd, 8pm [3 days] - Hard dry fast (might change to soft earlier than planned)`

`- Sun 22nd, 8pm to Thu 26th, 8pm [4 days] - Soft dry fast (might change to water earlier than planned)`

`- Thu 26th, 8pm to Wed 1st, 8pm [6 days] - Water fast (might add coffee and tea towards the end)`

`- Wed 1st, 8pm to Mon 6th - Refeed (broth the 1st day, reintroduce different foods each day)`

I'll have work on fasting days Dec 20th, 23rd, 27th, and 30th, but I'll probably work from home and won't have much to do. Other than that, I should only have boredom and insomnia as my main concerns.

I'm aware that it will be a stretch from my previous experience, but I won't be too hard on myself in case I end up doing 2 or 3 smaller fasts instead of 1 long one during this period.

Even though most people will be celebrating the holidays with their loved ones, if someone out there feels like taking on a challenge together, please, let me know 🥰",1,1733172138.0,Dryfasting,0,1.0,False

Looking for a comfortable keyboard that won't leave your wrists aching after a long day of typing? I recently got my hands on the Logitech K650, and it's been a game-changer for my home office setup.

This full-size wireless keyboard has some nice features that make it stand out. The built-in palm rest and cushioned keys felt great as I typed away for hours. I liked being able to adjust the tilt to find the perfect angle. The shortcut keys for things like muting my mic came in handy during video calls too.

https://preview.redd.it/vg5jaro6yh4e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b23724a2777bbb231c05b18d714249f1019a948

I had no issues connecting the K650 to my laptop using Bluetooth. The battery life seems solid so far - Logitech claims it can last up to 3 years, which would be great. It works with Windows, Mac, and other systems, so it's pretty versatile.

While I enjoy using this keyboard, it's not perfect. The keys aren't backlit, which can be tricky in low light. And if you're used to mechanical keyboards, the membrane keys may feel a bit mushy at first.

# Bottom Line

The Logitech K650 is a solid choice if you want a comfy, wireless keyboard for everyday use. Its ergonomic design and handy features make it worth trying out.



# Logitech Signature K650 Wireless Comfort Keyboard: Enhancing Your Typing Experience

I recently got my hands on the K650 and I'm impressed. The soft palm rest and cushioned keys make typing a breeze. I can work for hours without discomfort. The full-size layout gives me quick access to all the keys I need, including handy shortcuts for muting my mic and taking screenshots.

I love that I can connect via Bluetooth or the included USB receiver. This flexibility lets me use it with my laptop and tablet. The keyboard works great with Windows and Mac, which is a big plus for me.

Battery life is amazing - I haven't had to change them in months. The spill-resistant design gives me peace of mind when I'm sipping coffee at my desk.

While I miss having backlit keys, the overall comfort and reliability make up for it. If you're looking for a comfortable, long-lasting wireless keyboard, the K650 is a solid choice.

# All Day Comfort: Soft-Touch Palm Rest and Deep-Cushioned Keys

I found the K650's comfort features impressive. The built-in soft-touch palm rest gives my wrists a cozy place to rest while typing. The deep-cushioned keys feel great under my fingers, reducing fatigue during long work sessions.

This keyboard is clearly designed for all-day use. I appreciate the adjustable feet that let me change the typing angle. It helps me find the perfect position for my hands.

The full-size layout puts all the keys right where I expect them. I don't have to hunt around for anything. The shortcut keys are handy too. I can quickly mute my mic or take a screenshot without interrupting my workflow.

While very comfortable, the cushy keys might feel a bit mushy to some users who prefer a crisper typing feel. But for me, the K650 strikes a nice balance between comfort and functionality.

# Achieve More with Customizable Shortcut Keys

I found the K650's shortcut keys to be a real time-saver. The keyboard has handy buttons for muting the mic, taking screenshots, and web navigation. These keys helped me work faster and more smoothly. I liked being able to access common functions without digging through menus. The full-size layout put all the shortcuts within easy reach. While the preset options were useful, I wish there was a way to customize the keys even more. Still, for most tasks, the built-in shortcuts got the job done well. The K650 made it simple to boost my productivity with just a few button presses.

# Freedom to Connect: Bluetooth and Logi Bolt Receiver

I love how easy it is to connect this keyboard to my devices. The K650 gives me two great options for wireless connectivity. I can use Bluetooth to pair it with my laptop or tablet without any extra dongles. For my desktop PC, I plug in the Logi Bolt USB receiver for a rock-solid connection. Switching between devices is quick and simple. The Bluetooth works well across Windows, Mac, and even my iPad. The Logi Bolt receiver is super reliable - I haven't had any lag or dropouts. It's nice to have both choices so I can use the keyboard with all my gear. The wireless range is great too - I can type from across the room without issues.

# Compatibility Across Devices and Operating Systems

I found the K650 keyboard to be really versatile when it comes to compatibility. It works smoothly with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux, and even mobile operating systems like iOS and Android. I tested it on my Windows laptop and iPad without any hiccups. The keyboard connects easily via Bluetooth or the included USB receiver. This flexibility is great for people who use multiple devices. I appreciated that I didn't need to buy separate keyboards for different gadgets. The K650 also has shortcut keys that work across platforms, which is handy. While it's mostly plug-and-play, some advanced features might need extra software on older systems. Overall, this keyboard plays nice with most modern devices and operating systems.

# Years of Power: Long-Lasting Battery Life

I was really impressed by how long this keyboard lasted on a single set of batteries. The K650 comes with two AA batteries included, which is a nice touch. In my experience using it daily for work, the battery life stretched for months without needing a replacement. This saved me the hassle of constantly swapping out batteries. The keyboard also has a handy on/off switch to conserve power when not in use. An LED indicator warns you when battery levels get low, so you're not caught off guard. For those who hate dealing with battery changes, this keyboard's longevity is a big plus.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this keyboard for a while now, and it's clear that Logitech has put some thought into balancing comfort and functionality. Let's break down what works well and where it falls short.

# Pros

* The soft-touch palm rest is a game-changer for long typing sessions. My wrists feel much better at the end of the day.
* Deep-cushioned keys make typing a breeze. They have a satisfying feel that's just right.
* Battery life is impressive. I haven't had to change batteries in months.
* It's easy to connect via Bluetooth or the Logi Bolt receiver. I've used both without issues.
* The full-size layout with a numpad is great for productivity.
* Shortcut keys for mic mute and screenshots are handy.

# Cons

* The keys aren't backlit, which can be a problem in low light.
* Some users might find it bulky compared to sleeker, more compact options.
* The plastic build feels a bit less premium than some other Logitech models.
* It lacks programmable keys for more advanced users.
* The Logi Options+ software is only compatible with newer operating systems.

While it's not perfect, I find the K650 to be a solid choice for everyday use. The comfort features really stand out, but the lack of backlighting is a miss for me. It's a good mid-range option that gets the job done without too many bells and whistles.

# Real User Insights: Analysis of Customer Reviews

I've spent some time digging into the customer feedback for the K650 keyboard. Many users praise its comfort and ease of use. The cushioned keys are a hit, making typing for long periods more pleasant. I noticed a lot of people like the wireless options - both Bluetooth and the USB receiver work well. The build quality seems solid, with several reviewers mentioning it's better than cheaper models they've tried.

Not everything is perfect though. Some users miss having backlit keys, which were on older Logitech models. A few folks had trouble with Linux compatibility, especially missing a print screen key. I also saw comments about language issues, with some non-English users getting an English layout by mistake.

Overall, most buyers seem happy with their purchase. The K650 looks like a good choice for anyone wanting a comfy, reliable keyboard for everyday use.

# Sustainability: A Product with a Conscience

I'm impressed by Logitech's commitment to eco-friendly design with the K650 keyboard. The company has made a real effort to use recycled materials. The graphite model contains 28% certified post-consumer recycled plastic, while the off-white version uses 21%. This helps reduce waste and the need for new raw materials.

The long 36-month battery life is another plus for sustainability. I won't need to replace batteries often, which cuts down on e-waste. The keyboard's durability and spill-resistance also mean it should last a long time before needing replacement.

While not perfect, these features show Logitech is taking steps to lessen their environmental impact. As a consumer, I appreciate when companies make sustainability a priority in their product design.

# Conclusion

I've spent a good amount of time using the K650, and it's clear this keyboard has a lot to offer. The cushioned keys feel great for long typing sessions, and the built-in wrist rest adds extra comfort. While it lacks backlighting, the wireless connectivity options are handy. The full-size layout with numpad is a plus for number crunchers. It's not perfect - some users may miss certain features or find small quirks. But for most people looking for a comfortable, reliable wireless keyboard, the K650 does the job well. It strikes a nice balance of comfort, functionality, and value that should satisfy many users' needs.",1,1733172006.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the Logitech K380 Pebble keyboard, and I'm impressed with its versatility. This compact Bluetooth keyboard works with many devices, from computers to phones to tablets.

I found it easy to switch between my laptop, phone, and tablet with just a button press. The keys felt nice to type on, and I liked how it adjusted to different operating systems. It's small enough to carry around but still comfortable for typing.

https://preview.redd.it/krt0beu3xh4e1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bad47018db1a08c3b3cbc75cf8a08835fb2c565c

The long battery life is a big plus. I haven't had to change the batteries yet, and Logitech says they can last up to two years. The wireless range is good too - I can use it from across the room.

While I like its compact size, some might find it a bit small for all-day typing. The round keys took a little getting used to, but I adjusted quickly.

# Bottom Line

The K380 Pebble is a great choice if you want a portable keyboard for multiple devices. It's well-made, works with many systems, and has long battery life.



# Engaging with the Logitech K380 Pebble Keyboard

I've been using this keyboard for a while now, and it's a game-changer. The K380 Pebble is super easy to set up. I just turned it on, and it paired with my devices in seconds. I love how I can switch between my laptop, tablet, and phone with a single button press. The keys feel nice to type on - they're quiet and have a good bounce. I've found the battery life to be great too. After months of daily use, I haven't had to change the batteries yet. While the compact size is perfect for my desk, I did need some time to get used to the layout. Overall, this keyboard has made working across my devices much smoother.

# Seamless Multi-Device Connectivity

I found the K380 Pebble keyboard to be a versatile companion for my digital life. It connects to three devices at once, which is super handy. I can type on my laptop, then quickly switch to my phone or tablet with just a button press. This feature saved me time and hassle when working across different gadgets.

The keyboard paired easily with my Windows PC, Android phone, and iPad. It even works with my Apple TV. I like how it adapts to each device, giving me familiar shortcuts no matter what I'm using.

One thing to note: while the wireless range is supposed to be 33 feet, I noticed it can be less in rooms with lots of obstacles. But for most setups, it works great. The long battery life is also a big plus - I haven't had to change the batteries in months of regular use.

# Extended Battery Life

I was impressed by the K380 Pebble's long-lasting battery. It runs on two AAA batteries that come included. Logitech claims the keyboard can last up to 2 years on a single set of batteries with normal use. In my experience, I haven't had to change the batteries once in several months of daily use. This is great for a wireless keyboard, as I don't have to worry about constantly recharging it or replacing batteries. The keyboard also has an auto-sleep feature that helps conserve power when not in use. A small LED indicator lets me know when the battery is running low. For me, the excellent battery life adds to the overall convenience and reliability of this compact Bluetooth keyboard.

# Lightweight Design and Portability

I was amazed by how light and portable the K380 Pebble is. At just 14.4 ounces, it's a breeze to carry around. I can easily slip it into my bag when I'm heading to a coffee shop or moving between rooms at home. The compact size (10.9 x 4.9 x 0.6 inches) means it takes up minimal space on my desk or in my backpack. Despite its small footprint, I found typing on it comfortable for extended periods. The dark grey color looks sleek and professional too. For anyone who needs a keyboard they can take anywhere, the K380 Pebble is a great choice. Its portability doesn't sacrifice functionality - I can still type efficiently whether I'm using it with my laptop, tablet, or phone.

# OS Adaptive Layout

I found the K380's smart layout adaptation really handy. When I switched between my Windows laptop and iPad, the keyboard automatically adjusted its layout and shortcuts. No need to relearn key positions or fumble with settings. The function keys changed to match each device too. On my Mac, the Command key worked as expected, while on Windows it became the Windows key. This made typing feel natural across all my gadgets. The only quirk I noticed was a slight delay sometimes when switching devices, but it was minor. Overall, the adaptive layout made using multiple devices much smoother.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this compact Bluetooth keyboard for a while now, and it's been quite an experience. Here's what I found:

# Pros

* Easy device switching: I can connect up to 3 devices and switch between them with a single button press. It's super convenient.
* Compact and portable: The keyboard is small enough to slip into my bag without adding much weight.
* Long battery life: I haven't needed to change the batteries yet. Logitech claims it can last up to 2 years.
* Quiet typing: The keys are soft and make very little noise when I type.
* Wide compatibility: It works well with my Windows laptop, iPad, and Android phone.

# Cons

* Small size: While great for portability, the compact layout took some getting used to. My typing speed was slower at first.
* No backlight: I sometimes struggle to see the keys in low light conditions.
* No number pad: I miss having a dedicated number pad for quick data entry.
* Non-rechargeable: It uses AAA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery.

Overall, the Logitech K380 Pebble is a solid choice if you need a portable keyboard for multiple devices. It's not perfect, but its pros outweigh the cons for my needs.

# Analyzing Customer Sentiments

I've noticed a lot of positive buzz around the K380 Pebble keyboard. Many users seem to love how easy it is to switch between devices. I found this feature really handy when working on my laptop and tablet. The compact size is another big plus - it doesn't take up much space on my desk.

Some people mentioned they were surprised by how much they enjoyed typing on it. I agree - the keys feel nice and responsive. The quiet typing is great for shared spaces too.

A few users did note it took some time to get used to the layout. I had a similar experience at first, but adapted quickly.

Overall, most folks seem happy with their purchase. The high ratings reflect the keyboard's quality and versatility. It's not perfect for everyone, but many find it a solid choice for multi-device typing.

# Conclusion

This compact keyboard has won me over with its versatility and ease of use. I've found it to be a reliable companion for my various devices, from my laptop to my tablet. The ability to switch between three devices quickly is a standout feature that has boosted my productivity. While the keys are on the small side, I got used to them pretty fast. The battery life is impressive too - I haven't had to change them in months of regular use. It's not perfect - I wish it had backlighting for low-light situations. But for its price and features, the K380 Pebble is a solid choice for anyone needing a portable, multi-device keyboard.",1,1733171640.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

I’m doing this review so in depth because upon buying a Mars X and considering it for 3 months I could only find several reviews or insights of using one daily from the everyday consumer like my self, so here it is a little insight and some problems I have with the machine☕️
If there’s anymore question and if I haven’t covered something you’d like to know please feel free to ask in the comments

Visuals, Ease of Use, Workflow;
First I’ll talk about visuals and what you actually see/feel as to me it’s just as important because it’s something I will use daily and have a routine with in the mornings so need to enjoy using the machine I buy. Visually it’s AMAZING, black stainless steel, well put together and the shine of the stainless steel is great to look at and catches eyes with visitors, first thing I noticed was the weight, 18kg vs 6.6kg of the bambino is completely different, no more holding the machine when inserting the portafilter like before, bringing me to the first problem! The feet on it are… bad, let’s say you put it together and placed where you want it then suddenly decide to move it ever so slightly back (like I did) it managed to scratch your nice and shiny steel surface instantly. I’m in the process to replace those from some on Etsy I’ve found. 

The workflow and ease of use is just that, easy, everything feels right for the most part, the lever is solid and satisfying to use which is the main reason I went for an e61 group head, using a machine should be enjoyment and having the lever to me makes it fun to use everytime, only problem with workflow I see is that because of how narrow the machine is the hot water spout actually gets on the way sometimes, I feel myself trying to avoid it to access my grinder next to it then moving it out the way of the lever to use it, it’s in an awkward place which some it would bother but for my current station i understand because it’s made it a smaller foot print for me to have it. 
I seen only with research you can pull the lever like normal to start the shot then if you feel the need can let it drop half way it doesn’t release the pressure but allows the puck to soak before letting the flow through again, wanted to clarify this because it’s something I wasn’t sure of working. 

Putting this in this category because technically it’s easy of use, the heat up time… to me it wasn’t a problem because I was able to other stuff which waiting but to solve a problem of home after work then leaving not long after I bought a smart plug (Tplink 110) which means I can set a schedule for the morning so when I get up it’s already on and heated up or just as I leave work I go on my phone and turn it on with the shortcuts, this has made it so so easy! 

Accessories; 
There’s not much to say about them, they’re heavy, weighted and compared to the ones that came with the bambino it’s a different league. The tamper weighs 320g which is a lot more than the 72g on the bambino and I don’t feel like I need to upgrade to a calibrated one like I did before. 
Portafilter feels great! Very nice to use and look at but you really need to clean it and take out the basket everytime as water stay in beneath it otherwise, but very surprised a bottomless one wasn’t included which I know is in the Bianca, most upgrade to a bottomless when going from a bambino or that area to a Mara x and above.  

Temperature Stability;
I will clarify I haven’t yet got a temperature probe to permenantly have in the group head but the only thing I had around was a cooking probe so I used it. The temperature was really really stable and kept within .5 sometimes but to all the time 1c above the temp it was set at meaning it working perfectly as the 3 settings are I believe 2 steps of temperature for each click. Turning the machine on to get to temp was 15 mins but leaving it 25 mins in brew mode means the steam wants was ready and had enough pressure to use constantly, otherwise you will start a shot then go to steam for a few seconds before it drops to .5-.8 bar. 
Temperature really does effect the taste, I tried a dark roast first with a Mara x and had it on the correct setting and even after having 300+ shots it was like I’ve just had my first one ever, the darkness, chocolate and caramel from my chosen beans were so obvious this time. It’s completely changed the way I taste notes in coffee… 

Things I wanted, would change, you’d want to know;
*a screen PID would be nice but understandable for the price point.
*change the feet! They’re not great at all and don’t fit the look of the machine.
*slightly different hot water spout design maybe a straight spout from somewhere or in a different area. 
*I made a mistake by removing the CAUTION HOT sticker from the group head which left glue, I tried to get it off but scratches up the stainless completely meaning I had to use polish to get it back to normal. Wish there was a warning within the manual early on about it. 
*This is normal but using the hot water tap on the right side, there’s a really metallic taste, I’m guess this is because the machine is new but after 6days and a few times pushing water out the spout it still tastes like it? ",18,1733171523.0,espresso,1,0.96,False
1h54xqe,https://i.redd.it/1xrq60vnwh4e1.jpeg,Anyone else have a crazy bathroom litter set up?,"My cat is a serial sprayer/elevator pee-er. I don’t know why and after 3 years, I’m absolutely stumped. He doesn’t pee inappropriately anywhere else, just right outside the litter box in a spray fashion. I’ve caught him doing it and noticed he doesn’t lower his butt (but he does when he poops and does in the litter box, go figure).

 I’ve tried everything (see list) and have finally given up. I even debated if he’d be happier as a “farm cat” and reached out to a place and once they answered, my heart just couldn’t do it. So now I’ve just adapted to it. The dream is to one day be financially well off enough to customize a “bathroom” for him entirely (entirely waterproofed and tiled, built in hoses, baseboard vacuums for the litter, etc - one can dream 🥲)

At this point, I just don’t want to have a smelly house and need to protect the floors. I dream of the days when I used to have a normal bathroom but now, the dream fancy cat litter bathroom is a more attainable fantasy. Has anyone else experienced this to this extent?

List of what I have tried:

- Stress Relief Measures:
         1. plug in pheromones (feliway)
         2. no loud music, tv always played low
         3. The guest bathroom is dedicated for      
         the litter so there’s no noise or commotion 
         around it.  
         4. I don’t board him anymore, if I have to 
         travel my parents come and pet sit 24/7.
         5. I never yell, raise my voice, or get angry
         with him regarding his bathroom behavior
         (or otherwise)
         6. I thought maybe he was doing the     
         peeing because he was lonely so I got a
        second cat (she’s perfect and has no urine
        issues) and it didn’t seem to make 
        a difference.

- Stimulation: He has ample toys of all variety (battery powered, springs, catnip stuffed, bells, teaser rods, sensory toys, cardboard scratch houses, standing scratchers, flat scratchers, two cat trees placed near windows, mounted window hammocks, tunnels and he’s allowed on the couches and bed). I also have a deck/patio so he gets outdoor time when the weather is nice and he is free to scratch away at the outdoor rug.

- Food: He has been on both an all dry and all wet diet, now I feed him a combo (temporary measure because he’s on a diet and then he’ll go back to only wet). I feed him in slow feeders to slow him down and make sure he gets supplements (powdered egg yolk, dried minnows, chicken hearts, etc). He always has water available in two different places in the house.

- Medical: He had a UTI 2 years ago and was treated for it. No issues since (I make sure he’s screened periodically as I know that can sometimes be related to inappropriate peeing but he’s all clear). He was on anxiety medication for a year (fluoxetine) which improved the issues at first and then they came back with a vengeance. He is no longer on it now. He is overweight (18lbs) so he is on a very deliberate diet. 

- Litter Specific: I genuinely don’t think there is anything I haven’t tried. I’ve tried litter types (crystals, clay, clumping, non clumping, corn, cassava, grass, tofu, coffee grounds, pellets, Dr Ellseys and even dirt/soil). I’ve tried litter boxes (enclosed, high walls, low walls, wide, low pans, walls with no ceiling, an enclosed litter box with a light on it, plastic, stainless steel). I’ve tried litter box numbers (I tried 2, 3, 4 and at one point 5 boxes and still nothing). I clean them RELIGIOUSLY, multiple times a day to no avail. He has peed/sprayed even after I’ve done a full deep clean. I use enzymatic cleaners only and then steam clean the floors, and then wipe with the urine cleaner again. I’ve also tried to use litter attractant. 

His current set up is in the attached picture. I bought a plexiglass tri wall on Amazon and use that to block him off so that he can’t wreck havoc over the entire bathroom. Marked in red on the photo is where he pees (he poops just fine in the litter box).

Anyways, mostly just venting because I don’t think there’s anything that will solve this and I’m not going to get rid of the little guy so we just adapt and overcome 😭

1h54ufu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h54ufu,What fasting did for me in ONE MONTH (Sept 25th -Oct 25th)🙌🏾,"Fasting methods: 
✨ADF 1-2 times a week 
✨OMAD (when I couldn’t do ADF😂)
✨Longest fast: 40 hours
✨ F 5’7 [SW : 190] [CW: 186.4] : (I have lost only 2 pounds the first month, a few weeks later like beginning of Nov, I was 186 so I could be lower at this point but haven’t checked in yet!)
[GW : 160-170] Not really sure this is attainable for my goals, as I do plan to do resistance and weight training? I’ll be building muscle, thus my weight 
yo-yoing a bit! I’m happy as long as the inches are shrinking and I’m toned 🫶🏾
✨My diet after breaking my fast can be diabolical sometimes. I’ve broken it with burgers and fries, hibachi, PIZZA (a lot) & anything that may have 1000 grams of sugar in it 🤣 but I know that’s okay! The beauty of fasting is being able to have more leeway to do these things AND STILL get crazy amazing results. I do plan to break my fast better the following months and incorporate more healthy foods in my diet for overall health and to help with energy ❤️‍🔥. My results probably would’ve been better had I did this in the beginning but one step at a time!

❤️‍🔥During fast: black coffee , ACV, any sugar free or zero drinks fly, beet root supp I take with stevia already in it and just started adding cream to my coffee❤️‍🔥

✨Side note✨: Me in the blue shirt is actually the first picture I took a month after fasting (It was a video but I took sceeenshots. Same sweats, but different shirt bc I couldn’t find the green one). I started Sept 25th 2024 and took the blue shirt video/photo October 25th 2024. I was flexing so my stomach looks extra small haha. But me in the same outfit (sweats and green shirt) in the AFTERS was taken literally yesterday, unflexed and after I ate. STILL LOOKING SNATCHED and whatttttt!? I’m happy 😆 🥹 I plan to incorporate consistent 10k steps a day , Pilates, and hiit to tone up more (:",84,1733171273.0,intermittentfasting,7,0.99,False
1h54u82,https://i.redd.it/a3q3206zvh4e1.jpeg,Dog chew review - for UK & strong chewers,"A while ago I asked for advice for our greyhound, Jet, as she is a strong chewer but gives up on chew treats when she doesn't make immediate progress.

After trialling a few, thought I'd do a review in case it helps others.

Best: Good Boy Large Chewy Braid - Jet got an early win by breaking a piece off so she kept going. The chew lasted over an hour and she seemed to entertain herself by breaking it into its different colours.

Runner up: Good Boy Mega Chicken Twist Dog Treat - lasted 30 mins, excellent runner up.

Too difficult: Hollings Smoked Shank - Jet chose this one herself at the pet store, no interest once home.

Interested but doesn't chew: Good Boy Large Knotted Bone Beef - Jet likes it enough that she keeps it. Only gave it a minor nibble. I partly cut it to show her it was edible. Interest was renewed but not as a chew toy. 

Zero interest: Canophera Dog Chew
Stick Coffee Wood - Jet doesn't even know it's a chew.

Maybe for other dogs: Yakers Dog Chew (original) - Jet showed no interest. We tried microwaving it as per the instructions. She hated the smell. Might try another flavour.

Too easy: Pedigree DentaStix Daily Dental Chews Large - lasts less than five minutes.

Bonus Jet photo where she didn't get people food but wasn't going to totally give up.

1h54q6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h54q6y/were_kicking_my_husbands_best_friend_out/,We're kicking my husband's best friend out...,"I don't know where to put this so I'm here. I didn't expect it to get this extreme and I don't really know what to do. I live with my husband and our two roommates, Muffin and Coffee. My husband bought this house around a decade ago to have a place for him and his friends to live. There's been a pretty constant stream of roommates living here but after a few horrible experiences, we decided not to get any more. That was, until our mutual friend Coffee didn't have a place to go so we offered our spare bedroom in the basement.

Muffin and my husband are best friends. They've been friends for probably about 15 years. They talk almost every day and play games with each other a ton. Muffin and I aren't super close but we're friendly with each other and we have nice little conversations.

When I first moved in, Muffin was a really good roommate, especially compared to the other two we had at the time. He was always cleaning up after himself, helping with household chores and would sometimes buy items for the house like toilet paper or coffee creamer. He would generally keep to himself and wouldn't get in our way. My husband would order food for him when we could and he would order food for us when he could. Our other two roommates moved out and so it was just him here for a while. It was actually pretty nice.

Muffin had a few beige flags that I ignored at the time because of how good he was in other areas. He would often make sexist remarks. It was never anything too bad but it was clear that Muffin saw women as different and lesser than men. He would also occasionally insult my husband if he came up in a conversation. For example, there was a twitch streamer that was outed because he was trying to hook up with underage girls. My roommate told me that my husband had defended the guy and told me my husband said ""well they were close enough to being of age"". I was shocked because I didn't think my husband would say something like that. He's never ever done things like that and he doesn't even watch twitch streamers. I trusted Muffin because he's my husband's best friend but I didn't know how to feel. I talked to my husband about it and he said he had no idea what I was talking about. This was really when I started being wary of my roommate because it was a really extreme thing to accuse my husband of.

Muffin quit his job over a year ago and has been struggling to find a new job. He's been hired for four jobs since then but two of them ghosted him and two of them fired him within two weeks. He hasn't made almost any money in that time and stopped paying rent. This caused my husband and I to go into debt because we were relying on that money. When I say debt, I mean extreme debt. My husband is extremely stressed out about it to the point of getting sick multiple times.

Muffin became obsessive over me after quitting his job. It wasn't obvious at first but I noticed a pattern over time. I'm not super mobile because of my disabilities so I can't do much during the day. However, I do make my own lunch and clean up when I feel good enough to. Muffin would stay in his area but if he heard me moving around or doing something, he would just appear and stand in the same room as me. At first, it was to start a conversation or to see if I needed help. Over time, he just stopped talking at all. He would just stand there and stare. I thought maybe because I was in his way so I would leave the room but then he would leave the room immediately if I wasn't in there. He would do it every time he heard me. I started trying to be as quiet as possible but any noise that was loud enough was it for him. Whenever he would go out the front door, he would stand at the door for at least five minutes and just stare at me except when my husband was home. The living room is right next to the front door and I face away from the door. The only reason I knew he was looking at me was because I could see him through the TV's reflection. I got really freaked out by this because it started happening multiple times a day. Muffin had originally had his computer in the basement, but we allowed Coffee to take the whole basement, which means Muffin had to move his computer into the spare bedroom. This has caused Muffin to use the front door almost triple the amount he was before. This meant more staring and more anxiety for me. Muffin got a girlfriend a few months ago and this behavior stopped. I never catch him staring at me anymore and he doesn't just show up when I'm doing something.

Over time, Muffin became less and less of a good roommate and started becoming a bad roommate. He stopped cleaning up, stopped picking up after himself and stopped buying stuff for the house. With the money he did earn while working, he bought brand new shoes instead of groceries. The food that he did eat was our food that we bought. We started going through food like crazy. The final straw for me was when my husband and I made chili. I really love chili and we don't often make it. I wasn't feeling the best the night we made it so I just told myself I'd have some the next day. I woke up and found Muffin had eaten all of the leftovers in one sitting. It was like 3-4 bowls of chili just... gone. He hadn't helped, he hadn't asked, he hadn't bought any of the groceries, nothing. He had gotten groceries a few times from his sister and his mom but the groceries he get would go to waste. He would still eat our food. Once he got a girlfriend, he made her buy him food, too. But, still, it went to waste.

My husband's father handles our finances and handles the roommates. He makes them sign legal contracts to live here so that way we're covered if something goes wrong. My FIL sent Muffin a notice at the beginning of November that he needed to move out or get a job. Around the 15th, I noticed that Muffin hadn't made any efforts towards anything. He wasn't applying for jobs or looking for a place to live. I started asking him questions about it and he told me that he wasn't taking the notice seriously. He was also mad at my FIL because he felt like it was unfair. He said that he had been trying to get a job and that should be enough. He also said he had just submitted an application for unemployment a few days ago but said it would take way more than two weeks to go through.

Muffin started behaving really weirdly after the notice. He started showing extreme people pleasing behaviors and manners. He started cleaning up occasionally and going out of his way to help my husband. The cleaning he did was only surface level, though, and it was only when I was awake. It was like he was trying to prove that he was useful without actually being useful. He was doing things like loading the dishwasher without running it or moving things off to the side so it looked cleaner without it actually being cleaner. He started becoming obsessive over little things that I mentioned. Like once, we were talking about a type of food that I really like. I mentioned that the area we live in doesn't have it and that we had wanted to make it last year but couldn't. He started frantically googling for it in the area, looking on different websites and even calling one of the places he thought would have it. He even told me he would ask a friend if he knew where to get some. I hadn't even mentioned that I had wanted to make it or anything, it was just small talk. It's hard to explain just how over the top the reaction was.

We reached the end of the month a few days ago and surprise, surprise, nothing happened. He had no job and didn't make any payments towards rent. I messaged my FIL on the 30th and asked what the plans were and he said he had messaged Muffin. Muffin stormed out of the house and went to his girlfriend's house. He hasn't been back since and now it's the 2nd. He's officially being kicked out, but now we're just waiting on my FIL to send him a date he needs to be gone by.

Muffin is NOT taking this well. He waited until the 30th and started off by begging my FIL to let him stay. He asked what he could do or say to stay here and my FIL said to ask us. So, he started begging my husband. Now, my husband seems to not want to put his foot down because he doesn't want to hurt Muffin so he made me do it. So, my husband asked me if there was anything Muffin could do or say to stay here. I said no. Not just because of the creepy behaviors, but also because we can't financially afford him. It's been way too long of him not paying rent and eating all of our food.

Based on what Muffin said in November, he's going to find every excuse in the book not to take accountability. I'm really hoping that this doesn't affect my husband's relationship with him but I don't even know if I want them being friends after all of this. I'm worried what will happen when he runs out of time. I've already seen how angry at my FIL he got, but now the anger is going to be directed towards us and probably specifically towards me.",1,1733170992.0,self,1,0.67,False

My husband and I (38F) have been married for 4 years, together for 6 and we are not at all on the same page financially. I spent the last few weeks reading money and couples advice books and came up with these date ideas. He laughed at me… 

He spends and I save. I’m sick of it. I want him to see the things that I’m saving for, for US, for our family and future and he just doesn’t get it! 

Can someone please explain - What’s wrong with my ideas!? 

•  Money History Talk in a Cozy Spot
Find a comfortable, intimate space, like a park or cozy cafe, and talk about early money memories. Share stories from childhood that shaped your money habits. This activity fosters openness and understanding about each other’s financial pasts, a key Gottman principle for connecting deeply on sensitive topics.

•  Spending Journal Swap
Each partner tracks their spending habits for a week, then shares insights over coffee. Focus on asking ""open-ended questions"" (like, ""What did you enjoy most about this purchase?"") to understand each other’s spending styles without criticism.

•  Monthly Financial Ritual
Designate one date night each month to review finances over dessert. Create a ritual around this to make it enjoyable and celebratory, reinforcing positive associations with financial planning and regular open communication

•  Budget Dinner Date
Over a meal, review a small monthly budget. Set a lighthearted challenge to reallocate a portion of it based on both partners’ goals. Use the ""gentle start-up"" technique to talk about priorities without judgment—focus on curiosity and understanding rather than critique.

•  Role-Switching Exercise
Each partner ""spends"" as they think the other would for a day or week and then reflects on the experience together. This builds empathy and understanding about spending habits by experiencing the world through the other’s perspective, promoting Gottman’s idea of shared power and influence

•  Values & Visioning Date
Create a vision board together. Each partner picks a few things they value most (like travel, hobbies, savings). Use this time to discuss why these values are important and how they shape spending preferences. This exercise, based on Gottman's ""Love Maps,"" helps build empathy by revealing the emotional motivations behind spending choices",2,1733170946.0,relationship_advice,10,0.75,False
1h54olx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Surrogate/comments/1h54olx/i_offered_to_surrogate_for_my_brother/,I offered to surrogate for my brother,"I offered to surrogate for my brother and his wife. They have had two miscarriages and can only try through IVF.

They haven't said yes, I think they will. But I want to know some of the complexities of doing this for a sibling. 

I had my daughter she is two and a half, and my family's side there's not going to be any cousins unless I do this or by some miracle his wife is able to have a baby to full term. 

I really want this for them, they would make such great parents. My heart aches every time they go through hardships with this. 

My husband and I have no intention of having any other kids. My husband just had a vasectomy. I'm currently a stay-at-home mom, so it wouldn't affect any career. 

I wrote down the entire list, that I have not presented to my brother or his wife. Well not really a list, it's just concerns I have. I wanted to make sure most of my concerns are addressed prior to any treatments to get me ready to be a surrogate. 

I'm excited for the chance for them to have a small family. I really want them to say yes.

Has anyone else gone through this with a sibling? Are there things that I should include on the list? 

I mostly have said that my life would be first in case of emergencies, I might be willing to try again... Explained I'm not giving up coffee entirely. Although I will stick with the doctors recommendations. I won't drastically change my diet, but of course I will make sure I'm eating correctly as to not harm the baby.  I have stated my wishes for during labor/epidural if possible.

His wife can be a bit crunchy. They threw away their microwave because they where afraid of it.. so I wanted to clear the air with how I'm going to eat prior to becoming pregnant.",1,1733170884.0,Surrogate,2,1.0,False

Burner because my main is tied to me.  

I love red wine.  Pinot noir in particular.  It’s comforting to me like my coffee in the morning- I love the room temperature drink and the robust flavors.  But over the last few years I’ve consumed more and more- to the point I am drinking 1-2 bottles a night and getting drunk.  

Understanding this is a hand to mouth habit comfort habit. and I can give or take any other drink (wine is literally all I consume for alcohol) I’m trying to change this behavior.  

This week I’ve decided I’m ready.  I’ve swapped to white claws at 5% alcohol.  Because I don’t love them (in fact it’s jarring to even drink them compared to wine) I’m drinking way less and not getting drunk.  But the thing is I’m not craving wine like I used to.  

I’m consuming on average 4 white claws a night spaced over 4-5 hours. My goal is to cut the alcohol % and end the association with the habit that gets me drunk.  Then I plan to cut the white claws after a few weeks of replacing the wine.  One week going strong. 

I don’t have concerns about withdrawal- I’m ready to quit- I’m more concerned with creating new behaviors to break the habit.  

I am concerned about the amount of alcohol and converting compared to wine, it and making sure I’m not replacing one habit with another. So far I think it’s working and I have not got drunk unintentionally- hardly even buzzed. It’s been an amazing week.  I also am not craving the wine like I used to.  

So can someone please let me know if I’m on the right path here as far as % of alcohol between the two and if this is the right path to be taking, thank you so much.
