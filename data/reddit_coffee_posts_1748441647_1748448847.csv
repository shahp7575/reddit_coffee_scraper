OK, after months of watching videos, trolling Reddit, and talking myself up to be a pro on day one, I quickly found out I have a ways to go to becoming a home barista.

One question that comes to mind regarding the grind: do you need to grind differently per portafilter?

I have a double spout portafilter; I feel as though I dialed it in pretty well—18g in, first drip at about 4 seconds, and 34–35g out after about 26–30 seconds.

My bottomless portafilter is larger and is supposed to take 20–22g of coffee. I was going to wait until the new basket arrived, but I thought I had it all figured out. I used the same grind size for 22g of coffee, tamped it down, turned on the machine, and it was spitting everywhere. Should I grind finer for a bottomless vs. a double spout portafilter?",1,1748448557.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1kxl1kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kxl1kg/i_spent_weeks_looking_for_a_spider_in_my_yard_it/,I spent weeks looking for a spider in my yard.  It found me.,"I’ve never liked spiders.  It’s not their fault, objectively I know that.  But when I see them, the eight shiny legs darting perfectly along a nearly invisible thread, grabbing and wrapping their prey… it frightens me.  I can only imagine myself as that prey, watching helplessly as a black silhouette emerges from the darkness to grab me, wrap me up, and slowly consume me.

Other invertebrates never evoked the same reaction.  I don’t like getting stung by bees, but overall I enjoy watching them hover from flower to flower, with their cheery colors.  Flies are an annoyance, crickets a welcome song in the night.

When I noticed the chaotic, strong web on my front porch, I wasn’t thrilled.  I cleared it with a broom, the whole time checking little cracks in the siding or behind our wooden bench for a creeping culprit.  I couldn’t find it.  As little as I liked that fact, it was outside, and there would always be spiders outside, so I went about my business.

The next morning, I was locking the door on my way to work, juggling my lunch and my coffee and my coat.  Under the bench, the web was back.  In a hurry to get to my car, I likely wouldn’t have noticed the translucent threads spanning from the seat of the bench down to the floorboards, except for one thing:  there was a mouse caught there.

It was dead, upside down, and mostly wrapped in a white silk.  The limbs were pinned to its sides, almost like a straight jacket.  The eyes were wide with terror and glazed over, staring blankly at the wooden planks beneath it.

To kill a mouse, it must have been a sizable spider.  My nose wrinkled in disgust at the thought of it, but I had to go to work.  The spider would have to wait.

The sun was setting as I returned, and the poor little mouse’s corpse was in the same place.  I swept it into a waste bin with a broom, and cleared the rest of the web.  Still, I couldn’t find the spider.  I tentatively flipped the cushion on the bench, expecting to see it staring back at me.  There was nothing.  The other nooks and crannies were all empty too, even the eaves of the porch were unoccupied.

Along two of the upright beams holding the roof, I found another spider’s web, with just a few midges adorning the concentric circles of silk.  An orange orb weaver sat right in the middle, with little hairs sticking out of her legs.  I knocked the spider and web onto the ground with my broom, and smacked the spider hard with it.  She didn’t die, but was dragging herself, with some of her legs sticking at odd angles.  They could still get around pretty well with three or more legs, I’d noticed.

I hit her again, which did the job, and swept her into the bin.  I didn’t want to just leave it there, since some spiders can be dangerous, and I didn’t know them well.

Moving on to my other tasks, I made dinner, did the laundry, and watched a show before bed.  My life is far from exciting, I’ll admit.  I’d finally gotten a promotion at work, and was putting pretty much all of my effort into the marketing company.  All of my peers did the same.

The spider evaded my attention for several days.  I thought about other things, like a normal, healthy person might.  It was only that weekend, when I went to rake leaves in the yard that it crawled up to the front of my mind.

There was something stuck on the outside of my chimney.  I thought it was a black trash bag.  The clouds backlit the shape, making it hard to see any details.  Only after taking a few steps did I recognize it as a crow.  A wing stuck out at an odd angle, while the rest of the body was cross-crossed with dull white lines, which suspended it in the air.

I gasped, realizing this bird had been caught by my spider.  I’d heard of small birds getting eaten, as well as mice.  Was it possible for one to catch a crow?

As soon as my shock wore off, I began looking for it.  The idea that a huge spider could be above me was unsettling, to say the least.  Eventually, I gathered the courage to poke at the corpse of the bird.  I half expected the spider to emerge from behind, to jump down on me.  It looked like there was nothing there.

This was beyond the pale for me, and I went inside to call an exterminator.  I left the bird up, figuring no one would believe me without evidence.  I called around and found someone who could be there in the afternoon.

What I had hoped to be a relaxing Saturday was anything but, as I wondered where the spider was hiding.  If it could kill a crow, I imagined the thing must have been the size of a tarantula.  Didn’t they normally stay near their webs?  It would need to be a large crevice or nook of some sort.

The chimney.

As soon as I thought it, I couldn’t think of anything else.

I ran to my living room.  There was supposed to be some kind of mesh to exclude birds and bats, wasn’t there? I hadn’t checked it since I moved in.  Also, I thought that I had the flu closed, but there was no way to know if that would stop a spider.

From a cabinet, I grabbed a long lighter, lighter fluid, and an empty cardboard box from a delivery the day before.  I threw the box in, drenched it in lighter fluid, and opened the flue.

When I put the lighter into the fireplace, here was a fireball which singed the hair from my hand.  It poured out of the glass doors, as I desperately tried to close them.  Within a moment the fire calmed down to a conventional blaze, and I ran outside.

I couldn’t see anything crawling out of the metal pipe atop the bricks.  There was a significant amount of smoke, and I was sure that no spider could have survived inside the chimney.  Confident that the spider wasn’t in there, or wasn’t alive if it was, I returned inside to wait for the exterminator.

He arrived with a smile, but his jaw dropped when I showed him the crow.  Soon his shock was replaced with a sort of excitement, and he asked to take pictures.  I agreed, and he began to snap away gleefully from his ladder.

He hypothesized it might be a joro spider, a large invasive species known for living in treetops.  He’d never seen one himself, but that was his best guess.  Since the spider was nowhere to be found, he offered to do what was called a “barrier spray”.  I accepted, hoping it would be effective.

With a backpack sprayer, he pretty much coated the outside of my house with pesticide, and a few feet of ground around it.  Over the next few days I noticed dead moths under the lamps, dead bees on the sidewalk, but no dead spider.  By the following week there were no more webs, and my mind was on work rather than the spider.

I was asleep in bed when a screaming woke me.  In a stupor for a few seconds, I thought it might be a person, but that didn’t match the sound.  It was a desperate screeching noise, and I wondered if it could be a pig or an owl.  Looking into the yard, I saw some sort of commotion in a bush, and grabbed a proper flashlight before going to investigate.

The leaves of the bush rustled, but the screaming had stopped.  Approaching cautiously, I shone the light into the branches, unsure of what I would find.

It was a rabbit.  I’d forgotten that they could be very loud, if they were being hurt.

There was no fox, no coyote in the bush.  The rabbit was kicking weakly, and I saw the silver shine of the threads at the same time I saw a black, shiny form scurry away into the dark foliage.  With the shadows of leaves and branches from my flashlight, it was impossible to make out how big it was exactly, but the bulky, jet black abdomen had been at least the size of my fist.

I ran back into my house.  I locked the door, as silly as that might sound.  My heart was racing.  I tried to look up every spider I could, but found nothing even remotely similar.  There was the Goliath bird eater in South America, but it still wasn’t big enough.  Besides that, it was covered in thick brown hair, not the shining black carapace I saw with my flashlight.  The spider I had seen reminded me of nothing more than an enormous black widow.

Afraid that I was going insane, I went back to the bush in the morning.  The rabbit was gone, as was the web.  With my broom handle, I poked at the bushes tentatively, afraid that at any point it could jump out at me, or that it would grab and pull the broom.

At this point, I needed evidence of it.  I wanted to send the webbing to a university or something, to see if they could figure out what it was.

As much as I looked, I couldn’t find any.  Nor could I find the rabbit.  Looking closely, I could see where the rabbit had kicked at the leaves on the soft ground under the bush, before it had been subdued.  I took a picture of that, at least.  Anything was better than nothing, I figured.  I also reached out to the pest control company, to try and get the pictures the man had taken of the crow.  They said he was servicing several other houses, but got my email so that he could send them to me at the end of the day.

I posted them on a forum, which got some attention.  Most people said that it must have been fishing line rather than spider web, or something of that nature.  The mystery spider was quickly becoming an obsession of mine.  Why would I be the person to see the largest spider ever recorded?  What cruel twist of fate would give that unwanted honor to me?

Before going to bed, I had several drinks.  I normally don’t drink much, especially if I have work.  However, one side effect of drinking is that I usually don’t have dreams.  I was afraid of what my dreams would be, and figured that even poor sleep was better than nightmares.

I was annoyed awaking that night, having to pee.  It was windy, with branches rustling against the house.

Pulling the blankets back, I paused in confusion.  All at once, the wind had stopped.  I looked out the window, and screamed.

It had not been branches tapping at my window, but the long, black legs of the spider.  Each one was the length of my forearm and hand, about as big around as a finger.  It was upside down, facing my window sill.  Hanging motionless since I had awoken, I couldn’t fight the feeling that the tapping I’d heard for several minutes was the spider’s long legs scratching at my window, trying to open it.

Unsure what to do, I stood, and the monstrosity scurried away out of sight, with a sound like pebbles being thrown at the glass.

I kept a baseball bat near my front door, and ran down the stairs to get it.  Flipping on the lights, I contemplated calling 911, but what would I say?  Would they send someone for what sounded like a bad dream?

Holding the bat firmly in my hand, I went all around the house turning on every indoor and outdoor light.  I looked through the windows with a frightened caution.  Could this thing break a window?  I knew that invertebrates tended to be disproportionately strong for their size.  It was only when I went to the front door that I finally saw it.

Hanging in the air in front of my porch light, the silhouette of it was a nightmare broken up by the cut glass of the decorative window in my front door.  Rushing to a nearby curtained window to see better, I saw it climb precisely along a colossal thread, disappearing up over the porch eaves.

Skin crawling with fear, I dialled 911.  When the operator answered, I said that I thought someone was trying to break into my house, and that I’d seen them on my porch.  They said a police officer would be there in about ten minutes, and to lock myself in my bedroom.

I didn’t go to the bedroom.  There were better lights down here, and the spider had gone up the last I’d seen.  Holding the curtain back from the window, I stared at the eaves intensely, for any movement.

By the time I saw it, four of the shining, black legs were already curling down from the roof, deftly holding the wooden boards.  Slowly, carefully, the head appeared in the light.  I couldn’t see the outline of the spider in the darkness, the bright porch light made shining reflections off of the finger sized fangs and eight perfectly spherical eyes.

With a mechanical precision, the legs began to pull at the web, the weight of the spider causing even the strong silk to sag noticeably.  The fangs began to work up and down independently as the legs one by one pulled in toward the mouth, gathering the silk there.

It was eating the web.  Efficiently, methodically, it was eating all of the strands criss-crossing my porch which it had hung from a minute before.  By the time the police got here there would be nothing left, and I would look like a lunatic.

It was still next to the roof.  I knew it was fast, but it had limits.  Unbolting the door, I cracked it open.  I needed a piece of the silk, or no one would believe me, and I would be left to face this thing alone.  The spider froze, staring straight at me.

Once, I watched a documentary on spiders, as difficult as it was for me.  Some of them showed surprising intelligence, especially considering how small they were.  Looking into the shining black voids that were its eyes, I couldn’t help but feel an intelligence there.  It had tried to open my window, from the sill, in the correct direction.  It had cast a web where it saw me enter and leave the house.  And now, it was destroying the evidence of its existence.  I knew that it was.

With the bat in one hand and the broom in the other, I took a swipe at the remaining web with the broom, hoping that some of it would stick, that I could pull the broom back into the house, and have proof that I wasn’t imagining everything.  When the broom hit the web it stuck, and I yanked as hard as I could.  The broom moved about a foot as if it was on a piece of elastic, then began to pull back into place.

The spider rushed at me, a flurry of legs descending from the beams of the ceiling.  I tried to close the door, but the broom handle was stuck there.  I tried to kick it out, but the spider was moving so fast I was forced to grab the door handle with both hands and pull.

The door pulled back against my grip.

This spider was unimaginably strong, and it was taking all of my strength to keep the door from opening.  Black legs curled around the open edge of the door, on both sides of my hand.  Through the widening crack, I saw the face and the fangs, dangerously close to my hand.  But I *could not* let go of the handle, I knew that.

I used to play tug of war as a kid.  This was nothing like that.  If you’ve ever played tug of war with a large dog, you might know the fierce pull they can exert with a jerk using their whole body, which can dislodge your grip.

This was something like that, but unimaginably faster.  The door jarred open two to three inches in an instant, and before I could react I had a photographic image of the fangs extending, their fine points burying into the skin of the back of my hand, the hateful eyes staring at me with an empty darkness before disappearing back through the door, along with the legs.  With the door opening just a little more, the broom handle had fallen free, and I pulled with all my strength, slamming the heavy wood closed, bolting and locking it instantly.

Blood dripped from two circular wounds in my hand, near my pinky.  They were separated by more than an inch, and looked like they might have nearly gone completely through the soft tissue in between the bones of my pinky and ring finger.  Immediately, I began to feel light headed.  I hoped that it was from the exertion, but when my hand began to go numb, I knew it wasn’t only that.

Soon, my whole right hand was paralyzed, completely useless.  I felt horribly nauseous as the numb tingling feeling worked its way up my arm, rendering it immobile.  I collapsed onto the couch, breathing hard.  Around the white boards of the eaves, those legs once again crept, slow and precise.  The fangs and eyes appeared from the darkness, and watched me keenly through the window.

I looked into them, my heart pounding, and a sinking feeling in my stomach.  The spider descended its web, carefully, and began to eat all of the silk off of the broom, which was hanging in the air.  It fell to the boards beneath with a clatter as the last of the web was consumed, and the spider cleaned up all of the remaining web.  It climbed a post back up, and watched me through the window, half paralyzed on the couch.

Part of me knew that creature would have an easier time catching birds or rabbits.  Deer, even.  It had not attacked me for food, I don’t think.  It had not clawed at my window or set a trap at my door for sustenance.  I didn’t kill spiders because I needed to.  I knew most of them weren’t dangerous, or aggressive.  I killed them *because I didn’t like them*.

Looking at the malice in those eyes, nestled between arm-length legs and gently wiggling fangs, I knew the spider attacked me out of hatred.  As the sirens approached, and blue and red lights flashed from down the block, it withdrew from sight, back into the night, thwarted.

Fighting against the venom, my mind raced.  I couldn’t deny a harsh realization, which made me feel both terror and shame.

That spider had more reason to kill me than I ever had to kill a spider.



The officer knocked on my door, and I managed to open it.  After going to the hospital, I felt ill for a couple of days but recovered well, except for a loss of feeling in my pinky.  I sold the house at a loss, got a transfer at work to another state, and got an apartment.  I couldn’t bring myself to keep living there, or anywhere near.

When I find spiders, I move them outside now.  I bought a vacuum thing specifically designed for that purpose.   I wish that I could say it was out of kindness, but it’s out of self-preservation.

Trigger Warnings ⚠️: Pregnancy-related stress, mention of abortion/miscarriage, suicide ideation, possible boundary violations

I’m (27) writing this because I honestly feel like I’m at the edge of my emotional rope, at my very wit's end, and I need outside perspectives. I’m not even sure if him (27) and I are still “in” a relationship right now —it’s all in a gray area to me— but we’ve been on and off for almost two years.

The reason it's a grey area right now is because two days ago he asked me to be girlfriend again and less than 24 hours after shit hit the fan because he insisted on wanting to talk to my dad, but when the time was there he was too anxious to do it. This has happened before. He initiates conversation with my father, insists that HE wants to talk to my old man about me, creates chaos by also wanting to bring his own father into things (without discussing anything with me by the way) and then backs out last minute. This second time my father actually got mad because he doesn't understand what he's on, wanting to talk to my father then to change his mind last minute because things aren't going his way.

Anyway, It’s been an intense ride from the very start. It’s been a rollercoaster full of emotions and feelings. And now, I’m also pregnant, and everything is crumbling under the weight of what I believe should be bringing softness and unity.

**To give some background**

I’ve been diagnosed with BPD around 4 years ago, when I was 23, and I’m very self-aware of it. I know my (unhealthy) patterns, I know my triggers, and I’ve worked hard to be mindful of how I respond to situations as best possible when intense emotions are triggered. Specialists I’ve seen since my diagnosis have told me that, for someone with BPD, my level of self-awareness is unusually high and I struggle to shift blame off myself, even when I was in the right. Two psychologists, who I've seen late December 2024 to early January 2025, have wondered if my symptoms were more due to untreated depression instead of BPD itself. My current psychiatrist, who has been treating me since January, is even considering rediagnosing me because he believes it's untreated depression that has affected me more than an actual personality disorder. Irregardless, I was never ashamed of having BPD. The diagnoses has, in fact, helped me learn about myself a lot over the past few years.

Moving on, I've been on antidepressants for six months now, too, and I have made a lot of progress. Friends and family all tell me that I'm calmer and softer than I was before, some even saying that I'm more myself again. I smile more, I'm less cynical, I am open to do more, I make decisions not based on emotions but out of a logical place now compared to before. I personally also feel more emotionally balanced now, and I believe I've grown so much, being able to actually *name* my emotions and take a step back before being reactive. I still struggle with being defensive and being offended on occasions, but I believe that's more a deep rooted personality trait that I am not proud of and am trying really hard to unlearn. This is a trait of that leads me to cut someone off or retract from a conversation, though I have been teaching myself to take a few steps back before I react based on these feelings. I'm not perfect, I never will be, but I do want to be better. Especially when it comes to communication.

But there’s one person who brings out a side of me, especially these traits that I'm trying to unlearn, I thought I had grown beyond and that’s my partner. I am not blaming him, my reactions and behavior are my responsibility, but I did notice a pattern, however.

Our relationship has been rocky, even unhealthy at times. We’ve broken up a few times before on his behalf. Fought countless of times, with small arguments escalating to really big ones that would easily drag out for two days despite me apologizing and owning up for my (rightful) reactions after emotionally overextending myself. Now I believe in intent vs. impact, but I also strongly believe in cause and effect — the latter usually being dismissed by the other party.

The love was there, and it still is, but it's constantly being undermined by how conflict is handled. Especially him. I’ve found that with him, I’m always walking on eggshells to prevent arguments to escalate, and even ***when*** I do it still manages to happen. Not because I don't know how to de-escalate, though I am guilty for not knowing when to shut up sometimes (I have the bad habit of ranting out loud when I am mad and feel unheard and wants me to shut up). But things usually also escalate because if I speak too openly about my emotions, I’ll trigger something in him that leads to him becoming anxious or saying that I'm going to trigger a panic attack. It usually leads to us having to focus on his anxiety (to prevent the panic attack) and it's caused because I didn't express myself kind or soft enough for his liking. Or I said something at a time that didn't work for him (e.g. he came from work and I would think out loud, even telling him that I don't need a reaction, but some light reassurance would be nice).

During arguments that I have 'caused' for the reasons mentioned above, he'll deflect and avoid responsibility, or turning everything back on me, by saying things like my body language not being right, or my tone triggering him, or my facial expressions making him feel uncomfortable. All of these can, if not will, trigger anxiety or a possible panic attack. If not handled right away or correctly he might have an emotional break down towards me and I'd be at fault for it because I didn't stop talking or I wasn't emotionally safe for him by consoling him in the moment. There have been many moments in which he used my words against me, too, taking my intentions and words the wrong way, which leads to me ove-explaining myself as a way to prove that I didn't mean it the way he took it. Then I'd spend minutes, if not hours, trying to convince and reassure and convince him of my true intentions, retracking my words, apologizing and rephrasing myself until it's good enough for his liking and for him to believe.

And, no, I am not trying to put him on blast here. I am no angel either. During arguments I can be sharp, say (mean) things I don't mean and regret right after. There has been an incident where I threw my phone, not at him, but at the floor out of frustration. It ended up ALMOST hitting my glass coffee table. In many instances, though, while being so frustrated I would lock myself in the bathroom and hit myself. And last but not least: when angry, I raise my voice and talk over him. Though, many times it's because I was still talking and he cut me off or talked over me. I also have the tendency to completely shut down and shut him out emotionally when I am overwhelmed and trying to self regulate while trying to be there for him by remained emotionally available as best as I can. I have been checking myself on this behavior and am anything but proud of it.

**Fast forward to recently: I found out I was pregnant, a steady week after we broke up again about a month ago**

When I first found out I was pregnant, I got a call from my GP after the sac they had seen was mistaken for a fibroid. I will save you guys the boring details, but long story short is that I reached out to him after a week of no-contact. At first I was hesitant, but due to us having had an abortion in November 2024 that we both ended up regretting, I figured I'd tell him about this. So I did.

We called, after I told him the news over text since I didn't if or when I was going to hear from him, and he agreed to come over. At first he suggested we meet on neutral ground (which would be outside my place) but after hearing how upset and distressed I was, he agreed to coming over to mine. Thinking I was going to be met with some compassion or empathy, I was met with stoicness, apathy and indifference. I pushed through that, despite being as emotional as I was, and we spoke about the situation. That was the very first time ever that he threw my BPD in my face. He said that, since I was torn between keeping the baby or having another abortion, he wants me to have an abortion. His reasoning being that he has read and seen (with a family member of his) what it's like to have a child with someone with a personality disorder. That right there broke me in ways I have yet to recover from.

I told him that that was a hurtful thing to say, he didn't seem moved by it, and just kept talking about how having a child with me would possibly affect him. We somehow also started talking about things between us and he, while I was already feeling so fragile, went on to talk about how free and at peace he feels without me having been in his life for the past week. How great and amazing he was doing, finally being able to hang with friends without having to think about me. Without having to think about my feelings (lol), that he was now free to sexually explore himself and have the threesome he has always wanted (which he always condemned me for because I had one with two women when I was 18-19ish, which was years before I met him). Asking him how he felt about me, he said that he no longer had any feelings for me, no longer felt a connection with me, but I was also the best woman that has ever happened to him. That he would never ever meet a woman as good as me. That he meant it when he said that I was it/the one for him.

He ended up leaving about an hour later, leaving me all alone with these burdens, but something also clicked for me in that moment. All I could think was ''fuck this, I'll do it my damn self if I have to.'' He ended up calling me about 10 minutes after leaving my place to apologize for the things he said to me. I cut him off and told him ''thank you for helping me lose feelings and letting go off this connection.'' and I hung up on him. The next day I woke up to at least 18 missed calls, several text messages in which he apologized but also told me that if I wanted to keep the baby, he'd fully support me. Then I received a voice note in which he apologized to me as well for how he spoke to me the day prior. A second voice note followed in which he told he wants to step up and be there for his child if I keep the baby, that he wouldn't want to do this (raising a child, co-parenting) with anyone else but me. Praised me for how good of a mother I'd be and that he shouldn't have said what he said. I ignored his many calls for a while, needing some time still too, but I eventually texted him back saying that he can keep his apologies, that I don't want or need anything from him, that I got it, and for him to enjoy his freedom and that I hope he finds what he's looking for. He quickly deflected, telling me that none of this is about us but it's about the baby. That he's the father and that he has rights as well - which is completely true. I would never ever in my life try and sabotage or keep a child away from its father. That is unless the father is obviously unstable and unsafe, but I don't have a reason to do so, right?

Anyway, I told him ''May I decide to keep the baby, it will have a father.'' and he took that as me raising the child with another man. That's also how those, who he showed our text exchange to took it as. I told him that due to medical reasons I wasn't even sure yet if it was viable and I didn't know whether I wanted to keep it yet because, come on.. Look at us. He decided that he'd reach out to me in 2 weeks, I told him that I'd appreciate it if he would keep the pregnancy to himself and for him to leave me alone. He said he'll hope to hear from me when the time is right and that I keep him the loop. He then told me to never joke about ''the child will have father'', he is the father. To which I responded with ''it was never a joke because ain't nothing funny, anything else?'' He didn't text me back. I took it upon myself to count back the weeks to see how far along I was and from my calculations I was 5 weeks along. I told him this, but he never texted back.

**After nearly 3 weeks I reached out to him again**

I reached out to him through text with a light message, not wanting to come off the wrong way, asking him if he'd be open for a phone call, or preferably a meetup. I had made my decision and wasn't going to do this over text. He texted me back about an hour later, asking me if I had made my decision. I told him that I did, which is why I reached out to him. We called and I told him that I was keeping the baby. I'm 27, have had an extremely traumatic miscarriage at 12-13 weeks, and an abortion I deeply regret and still mourn to this day. And I also didn't want to go through another abortion in less than 2 years. I am having my baby that I've been actually wanting for so long.

He sounded shocked, but also... Happy? There wasn't any anger or frustration, to my own surprise. Believe it or not, but we started talking like we usually would. What should have been a quick phone call ended up being a 2-hour phone call of us catching up, cracking up with each other, admitting that we miss each other, reminiscing and eventually meeting up. I went over his. We're all adults, everybody probably knows what happened. I ended up staying over at his for nearly an entire week, from Monday to Friday. We made love, we talked about things, we admitted that we cannot leave each other alone, we wanted to work on this between the two of us for the sake of our baby, we argued - all that. But he also demanded a paternity test after the baby is born because of me saying ''may I decide to keep the baby, it will have a father.'' Not only that, but he also kept telling me that he needs to see at least two pregnancy tests turn positive with his own eyes. Mind you, I had shown him the two pregnancy tests I took on the day I told him because that's what my GP asked me to do.

While we were intimate he would tell me how much he loves me, that I'm the only one he wants, that I need to stop pissing him off because he only wants me and nobody else. You know... All the things everybody wants to hear to feel wanted. Unfortunately his behavior towards me during the week I was with him would sometimes contradict his words. I would many times tell him to be kind to me, treat me as an individual instead of making me feel like I'm a human incubator and s\*x doll. His excuse was that he still had some issues with me due to the argument we had before we broke up. Because of this he wanted to sit down with me and my psychiatrist as a neutral third party for us to work through things. I agreed and made an appointment. I wanted to work on things as much as he did. Despite having multiple arguments, we also talked things out right away. We really wanted  to work on this for the baby, and also for us, that was my impression. There had been times where I wanted to leave, and I said so during arguments, I didn't. I had to remind myself that I can't always run when things become too much, especially not when a baby is involved or not to hurt the other person. So I stayed every time because I am teaching myself to stop leaving. Now I also need to learn that when I say ''I'm leaving'' I take it back and say ''That was a thought, but I'm not really going to. I want to talk things out.''

That Friday we argued, too. I ended up leaving at 12:00 a.m. because I had to go to my mother, but I also left because I didn't want to be around how him anymore. Not after the way we argued - I had asked him why he was so hellbent and commanding me about taking a pregnancy test in front of him. I don't mind, but he's been demanding it rather than asking me. He needs to see a form of confirmation to become calm about all of this, though he could have also asked for my medical report. However, I had yet to fully warm up to him too before I started fully sharing medical reports.

Anyway, I ended up becoming unwell at the train station once I arrived in the city my mother lives in 30 minutes. Paramedics had to tend to me because I almost fainted, and they ended up calling him to tell him what had happened to me. During that phone call he told them I was pregnant, which is something I didn't tell them myself. This led to an ambulance being called and after being examined in the ambulance, it turned out my blood sugar was extremely low and my blood pressure was a little higher than they had prefered. While talking to the paramedic, she had been asking me questions to know why I was out so late, why I didn't tell them about the pregnancy right away, if everything was okay between my boyfriend and I. I didn't want them to think badly about him or our dynamic, so I said we were fine. But I eventually slipped up and admitted that I was stressing and hadn't really eaten much because my boyfriend and I had been arguing. She said that that's not good and I really need to start thinking of myself and my baby. When he showed up at the ambulance, the paramedic really pressed him that I need to eat more and keep stress levels as low as possible.

Once I was good to go, he hugged me when we were outside and he told me to never scare him like that ever again. Also that I should know that he really loves and cares about me, to never question it ever again because he spent nearly 90 bucks on a taxi to come to me. We went back to mine and in the taxi he told me that, due to him going to work an hour away soon, he needs to tell at least someone that I'm pregnant. Preferably my dad. I didn't want to but I understood where he was coming from, so we agreed to do it the next day or he would call in sick. I told him not to call in sick, but let's do it on Sunday when he doesn't have to work. He insisted on the day he had to work, which I was opposed to, but I gave in. He assured me that we were going to tell my father (who I have a really close bond with btw!) together because I was anxious about it. I actually didn't want to do it, but he convinced me with his reassurance.

That night he asked me to be his girlfriend again. I had pretended to think, but I said yes. I asked him if he wanted to be my boyfriend again, too, to which he said yes as well. But he had a few conditions: I start eating more, stop stressing less, we see a psychiatrist at least once a month to work through our issues and I tell my dad that I am expecting. We shook and pinky promised on it and were officially back together.

**The next day was an absolute shit show, which is why we are where we are now**

He wanted to talk to my father. After waking me up at least three times (I fell asleep around 6 a.m. but even so, I'm pregnant and extremely tired and also coming down from the previous night) to see if I had  spoken to my dad, I texted my dad. He wasn't up yet around the time I texted him, but my partner kept asking if my dad had texted back yet. If I had heard anything back. Every time I would tell him no, that my dad tends to wake up around 12-1 p.m. He insisted I call him or we just go over to his place unannounced. Now I know my dad — he does not like unexpected visitors (neither do I btw) and he also isn't the type to answer his phone when he's sleeping. My partner kept asking me and telling me what to do in regards of getting in contact with my father, and I kept reassuring him that he will get back to me. His reasoning being that he was behaving like that was because he had to go to work. Something I completely understood.

My dad eventually got back to me and I told him we'd call him around 2 p.m. He said he wasn't home and he'd call me when he did. I agreed with him, told my partner this, but that wasn't good enough for him because he needed/wanted to talk to my dad when it was convenient to *him* only. However, that wasn't going to happen. Time passed, we were intimate, the energy had settled and we were just cuddling. 2 p.m. struck and my partner started becoming restless because my dad had yet to call or reach out. A few minutes later I received a voice note from my dad telling me that he's still on his way home, but that he'd call me as soon as he was inside. I told my partner this after he asked me if I heard anything from my dad. That didn't necessarily calm him, leaving him to still be anxious. As a way to relax he asked if I wanted to have s\*x to which I kindly turned him down because I was extremely nauseous and tired as well. He said: ''Alright, I'll deal with my anxiety myself then.'' and turned his back to me to lay. Me being me, I cuddled up to him, stroke and kissed his back, as a way to help him calm down. In less than 10 minutes he jumped up saying that he's too anxious and he has to go. That he has only been back at mine for less than 24 hrs and he's already anxious being here. This caught me of guard and I reminded him that he can't leave because he promised we would tell my dad together.

Somewhat of a light argument ensued, in which he kept saying he's going to go, he has to leave. I kept reminding him of his promise, but he didn't seem to care for any of that, just his anxiety. I told him to just go then because he's starting to make me worked up, that I'll tell my dad myself because ''I do everything my damn self all the time anyway.'' He doubled down saying that he didn't want to leave but all of this was making him anxious because we HAVE to tell my dad and my dad was taking forever.

It turned out that my dad's cousin, who is staying with him, was home and to preserve my privacy my dad hadn't called me yet. To calm things down for my partner, I texted my dad and told him the news (not how I wanted to do it, btw) along with an explanation that my partner is really anxious and also has to go to work, all this waiting is making him restless. My dad was quick to say that he already sensed that I'm pregnant but he was waiting for me to tell him myself. I told my partner this and for a moment he seemed to calm down. I sat down next to him because he asked and we talked for a little. Then he became anxious again. I tried to calm him down, even telling him to call in sick from work by telling them that I have a medical emergency, but he insisted that he couldn't. He kept saying that it was too late for him to call in sick now, that I should have told him the night prior or this morning (I was sleeping) because I know he takes things literal. I told him that it's not my responsibility, but I am telling him to do so now. He kept repeating himself, even saying that he knew that this was going to happen. That he can't trust my words. Then doubled down saying that he's lashing out at me because of my dad's behavior, that the anxiety isn't my fault but my dad's.

Once my dad finally called, instead of staying my partner decided that he can't do it and he left. He literally left right as my dad called and left me to do something I didn't want to do and he promised we would do together. Disappointed would be an understatement. My dad tried calling him personally a few times, but he didn't answer. When he finally called my dad back they made plans to meet up the next day, on Sunday, to talk. Mind you, my partner is the one who initiated to talk with my dad. I called to check in on him, see if he spoke with my father and he did. BUT then he told me he's trying to reschedule this 'talk' to two weeks later because his father wants to be there, too. WHY? Because they believe that he, a grown ass man who initiated this conversation ABOUT ME with my own father, shouldn't be having the conversation without his father. That where I asked him what the H\*ll he's doing and nothing is being discussed with me. **Also that this is ridiculous since we're 27 and not 15 or 16 year olds!!!!!** He quickly deflected telling me that if the phone call is going to be a one way conversation or that is the tone (a firm one to set boundaries..) I'm going to talk to him in before work that he's going to end the call. I hung up, took a breather and called back trying to have the conversation again. He tried to justify his actions by saying that if he's going to be talking to my father, his father should be there too, which really agitated me because my autonomy seemed to not be respected. And this is NOT the first time he has done something like this. Out of frustration, hurt, defeat, stripped from my autonomy, I screamed: ''You know what I'm just going to have an abortion at this point. I'll call the clinic on Monday. I can't do this anymore.'' I ended the call and called my father crying.

My father, of course, was not pleased with any of this. Mind you, I actually really want this baby and have yet been able to let any of it sink in so I can be happy. I told my dad all of this too, and that he (my partner) had already told family, friends, coworkers and acquaintances that I am expecting. He did this without my consent, without my knowledge and far before I was even sure about my choice. Not only that, but I was only 5-6 weeks at most at the time. I haven't even marked 9 weeks yet as I'm writing this... So please understand why I was so frustrated and hurt about my autonomy OR privacy not being respected. His reasoning being, again, ''People could tell I was going through something, I couldn't hide it. I was too anxious.'' Mind you, again, all these weeks and days I have been dealing with all of this alone. Nobody, except my best friend who I haven't even told my final decision because I wanted to surprise her with the news, knows!

Anyway... I spoke to my dad most of the day, telling him how I don't want an abortion again. How I'm hurting. I even reached out to his father to clear the air, especially when it comes to this big misunderstanding that our fathers and him need to sit with each other. And I also made it very clear that I do not like that fact that our parents are getting involved in this. Despite me kindly asking his father to get back to me to talk about this (also so I could apologize for this chaotic mess that his son has created), his dad never did. It has been 4 days or so. Yet it was a problem when my dad couldn't call us quick enough.

I ended up needing medical attention again that night. I fainted again due to stress and a low blood sugar from not eating enough. The conversation I had with the paramedics was emotionally intense because, upon looking in my medical file and seeing that I needed medical attention the night prior as well for the same reasons, they were worried. Again I didn't tell them about what happened between him and I earlier, but with how kind and persuasive they can be, I ended up opening up. They said that I was in an emotionally unsafe environment (again) and that I might consider seeking a form of help for this. And also that I needed to really start taking care of myself better for the sake of my baby. They didn't say it's emotional abuse, but they did say that I am exposed to someone who is emotionally unsafe for me and that other licensed professionals might consider this something more serious. Especially after I opened up about our phone call and showed them a few text exchanges.

After they left I was left in shambles and I reach out to him. He was at work, but I took it upon myself to approach him with transparency and respect about all of this. We ended up calling the next day, despite me prefering to do it face to face. He said he was too tired to come to my place and I could have suggested coming to his. That's true, but that didn't cross my mind nor did I feel like I was welcome.

I’ve always believed in fairness, and I never want him to feel like I'd use the system being in the mother's benefit or our current situation against him may it have to come that far. I even went as far as sharing with him what rights he does and doesn’t have legally — especially considering we’re not married. Also because there have been moments that have been documented in my medical file, prior to the pregnancy, that arguments between us have led to severe emotional distress for me. On one occasion with me even harming myself due to how I was spoken to by him and needing psychological crisis intervention. Me harming myself was not his fault, however the way he spoke to me knowing where I was and how I was doing mentally was a big trigger for me. I made sure he knew these things in detail so he wouldn't be caught off guard, may he choose to continue treating me as he is or even distancing himself from the pregnancy.

I told him that under the law in the country we live in (I do not know about other countries yet), I would be the primary caregiver, but I also made it clear that I wasn’t trying to take advantage of that. I wanted him to be informed, to be part of the pregnancy from the very start — because that’s what equality looks like to me. Also because I always knew how important the role of being a father is to him. I also want things to be fair and transparent between us for both of us and the child in the healthiest way possible.

I told him everything. From what the paramedics discussed with me up until his rights (I did some deep research due to how he kept talking about his rights multiple times). He listened and thanked me afterwards for being honest with him. He knows that I didn't owe it to him. Then he asked what I needed from him during this time.

I told him the truth: I need him to stop causing me stress, to start being kinder to me, and to stop sharing private things about my pregnancy with others without my consent. I said it starts with the mother — if I’m not okay, the baby isn’t okay. And if he continues to be a source of distress, that’s not just harmful to me and the baby, but it can work against him in the long run if this ever ended up in court. Which is something I really do ***not*** want. I also asked him to stop making my pregnancy a public topic in his circle before we’ve even had space to figure things out ourselves, since that was our initial goal as the weeks went by.

During that phone call, I also asked him what he needed, what he wanted. I was trying to keep things open and mutual. But he kept saying he was afraid to tell me anything because he didn’t trust me, that anything he said might be used against him. That he felt like I’d weaponize his words. That really hurt. I was trying so hard to be transparent, to keep him in the loop, to honor both our perspectives. I even said — look, I’m telling you things I don’t even **have** to tell you, I’m going out of my way to make sure you’re informed and involved, and you still think I’m going to blindside you?

Eventually, the call ended kind of awkwardly, if I say so myself. Then about 15–30 minutes later, he called again. He said he needed to be honest and if he could without me being reactive. I told him that I'd love to, I'm here for him. He told me he felt like I was taking away his freedom. That he couldn’t be himself because of me. That by asking him not to share details about the pregnancy with others (yet), I was making him feel like he had no outlet, no voice. And then, almost casually, he dropped that he was “looking at bridges” — implying he was suicidal. My boundaries, once again (since this isn't the first time), were making him uncomfortable and suicidal.

I froze. I started becoming upset because that is NOT a position I want to put anyone in for the sake of my emotional safety. That completely broke me. I said, fine, just talk to whoever you need to talk to. Do what you need to feel okay. I lifted the boundary I set, despite it being there to protect my own peace and privacy, just to ease his discomfort. I ended up being the one crying, getting worked up, feeling torn to shreds, but somehow I was the one to soothe him again. To make sure he was okay. He even said that he wasn't sure whether we were still together, he assumes we weren't with the way I had spoken to him the day before, that it was very unclear to him. I became even more upset over that. In a bit of an indifferent voice he soothed me, telling me that he's there and that he's not going anywhere. For me to calm down and stop stressing.

Once the realization settled that I lifted the boundary for him he said he felt lighter. He thanked me and started talking to me in a warmer and kinder voice. That came after he told me that the way I told him to go talk to whoever he needs to talk to was unkind of me. That if I wanted him to be kind, I should be doing the same thing to him. So I ended up apologizing for what I said at least five times, and rephrasing myself entirely.

Later that night, I ended up checking in on him (because of course I did). I asked how he was doing, if he had managed to talk to anyone. He replied that he hadn’t yet, but was just processing everything that had been said and done. No “how are you,” no checking in on me, no acknowledgment of my breakdown. Nothing.

Then on Monday, we were supposed to meet up — I had agreed to take the pregnancy test in his presence, so he could be involved and finally feel a sense of mental calmness. Last minute, the morning of, he canceled. After commanding, demanding, pushing for me to do this for him. He texted me that he had thought everything over, and in with everything that happened the previous 72 hours, he decided that he didn’t want to see me that day. That he needed two weeks of minimal to no contact to “process everything and figure out for himself how to move forward in the healthiest way for all parties.” He signed the message “sincerely yours” and his name, like it was some formal resignation letter.

I didn’t reply. I just sat with it.

**And I realized something I’ve been avoiding for a long time:** this man will never change. Not even if a child is involved. No matter how beautiful and sweet he sells his words. That emotionally immature, self-centered, emotionally manipulative version of him is always going to show up eventually. Even when I only see the good in him — how sweet, kind, sensitive and thoughtful he is as well. But I also know I can’t keep sacrificing my needs and my peace just to keep him stable.

I, too, am still processing all of this while being pregnant still. I’m grieving so much. I feel betrayed, exhausted, emotionally depleted. I don’t even know what to expect from these two weeks of space because I don't even know where we stand. All I know is that I can’t keep breaking myself to hold him together. Not us, but **him**.

Thanks for reading. I don’t even know what I’m asking for — maybe just your thoughts whether is my BPD possibly effing things up, maybe some clarity or advice on the situation, or validation that I’m actually not losing it. Even if you think I'm totally in the wrong, call me out on it please so I can learn from this. Anything, really. I need to have conversations with people from outside each our circles.

TL;DR: I’m about 8 weeks pregnant and shared the news with my partner, who then told his family, friends, coworkers and acquaintances out of anxiety despite me asking him to keep it to himself as I decide whether I'm keeping the baby or not since we were broke up. He wanted to tell to my dad about the pregnancy after I needed medical help, which caused tension between us. There were delays and miscommunications with my dad for him, and my partner struggled with waiting and felt overwhelmed. This left him bailing on me despite promising to tell my dad together. Despite my efforts to be transparent and set boundaries, he felt like his freedom was being limited, and shared that it was causing him to struggle emotionally. After a tough 72 hours for the both of us, he asked for space for the coming two weeks to process everything, and I’m left trying to balance my own needs while navigating this complicated situation. I’m trying to figure out what’s best for all of us moving forward.",1,1748448477.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

As drivers, how do you prefer your customer deal with an issue like this.

First, I always try to do right by my drivers, no matter the app. On bigger orders, I usually go with the default tip amount, then add more after if the driver did awesome. My driver today went the extra mile.

The basics for this order: $16.00 tip @ 2.1 mile delivery from store to door. The order was 2 bags, 6 Items. 3 food, 3 drinks. 

As the Uber driver arrived, my neighbor's yappy little 💩 machine, ran out, jumped their little 3 foot tall fence and tripped the driver. He saved the food, but the coffee was a gonner. I ran out to make sure he was ok because it looked like he face planted, he seemed more embarrassed than anything else. 

He said he was going to get us the order again. I told him not to worry about it, I would just reorder for somewhere else, after 8am the little coffee place became a 25 minute wait to order (not even that great) and I didn't want him to miss out on deliveries while the cafe deprioritized app orders. One of those kind of places.

He was very polite and insisted, saying he was doing by the hour or something like that so he didn't mind reporting an order issue waiting if I didn't mind. I told hin again, it really wasn't a big deal but I could tell it was important to him.

He said something like ""Gotta earn those 5 Stars!"" with a huge grin... forgetting to give me the food lol.

Anyways, when he got back, I doubled the tip, since he basically did the order twice. Well, first a message popped basically saying I couldn't tip that much. So I tried to lower the amount by just a few dollars, thats when I got that error in the picture.

He was confused and so was I. I tried to give him cash, he refused and asked if I could message CS to manually adjust the tip. Said no problem and they did. 

Is that normal/preferred in situations like that? just curious

I am travelling to Cancun for a week this summer, and am looking at possible all inclusive resorts. I am travelling with my dad, so no children, but open to either adults only or family resorts. 

We have stayed at Iberostar Paraiso Del Mar and Barcelo Maya Tropical in the past. We're considering rebooking Del Mar, but wanted to investigate any alternatives before doing this. 

Really our requirements are:

* Large hotel with lots to explore - we really enjoyed visiting the other hotels at both Del Mar and Tropical. The trolley at Del Mar was excellent. 
* Variety of pools 
* Coffee Shop
* Selection of a la cartes available - included within all inclusive aspect. 
* Beach access 

  
Budget wise we're looking at a similar price to the Barcelos / Iberostars.

Campaign Introduction
I'm Walter Byrne, a 28-year Army veteran launching Maple City Music in Saint Albans, Vermont. After three deployments and an ongoing medical retirement, I found healing in music—and now I’m building a record store that offers that same space for others.

Maple City Music is more than a business. It’s a community hub where stories are shared through vinyl, local art is celebrated, and veterans always have a place—and a cup of coffee—waiting for them.

What We're Raising Funds For
We’re raising funds to support the launch of our physical retail location in downtown Saint Albans, Vermont. Your support will help us:
- Expand inventory of vinyl, tapes, and CDs
- Build a coffee bar (free for veterans)
- Install a listening lounge and turntable stations
- Feature local and veteran artists
- Finalize the store buildout, signage, and furnishings
- Create an inclusive, accessible space for the entire community

Why It Matters
Music has always been there when words failed—through combat, recovery, and transition. Maple City Music is built on the belief that shared stories, especially from veterans, deserve a place to live and be heard. We want to preserve physical media and foster a space that connects people to sound, memory, and each other.

How You Can Help
- Donate what you can—every $5 helps us move closer to opening
- Share the campaign with fellow music lovers and veterans
- Follow @maplecitymusic on Instagram and Facebook for updates
- Reach out if you’re a Vermont artist or veteran-owned business—we’d love to collaborate

Stretch Goals
- At $15,000 – Vinyl inventory fully stocked
- At $25,000 – Listening lounge + coffee bar complete
- At $35,000 – Veteran and local artist gallery space opens
- At $50,000 – Launch concert + free veteran music workshop

Updates Plan
We’ll post weekly updates, including:
- Behind-the-scenes progress on the store
- Artist features
- Equipment deliveries
- Crowdfunding milestones
- Thank-yous to donors and supporters

Final Words

>Dennis Black preceded the pastor on the countdown list, and with less than four weeks between now and his deadline, our normal lives left little time to discuss and plan the finer details.

>Mr. Black, apparently, was an up-and-coming local painter and metal sculptor, his work already gracing the trendier districts of town. The only pieces of “art” in the police station were copies of old pastoral images like you’d find in a hospital, hence why I’d never heard of him. That, and I took my coffee without two pumps of hazelnut-soy-half-caff frills and frippery, and didn’t bother frequenting the areas that did. With more free time than Stevens or I, he did most of the grunt work needed for collecting the trap’s material components, bankrolled by yours truly, of course. At least salt was cheap. He was a good kid, though, just blinded by his ambition, and now he was spending his time—what remained of it—using his gift to spruce up the city and make a name for himself.

>The pastor was another story. Shepherd of a small church in the heart of the city, he never once mentioned what he traded his soul for. He didn't directly give his name either, and I respected his privacy enough not to double-check the list, so we just called him Father, and he didn’t seem to mind. He did, however, help us bless a great deal of water right in Dennis’ bathtub, the excess holy water filling a few cheap water pistols I picked up from a box store. It still sounded like a stupid idea, but any little bit helped.

>A high schooler this time, and it was a tough one. I didn’t eat for two days. How did a demon sink her claws into someone so young and impressionable? She would have been twelve or thirteen at the time of her deal. This couldn’t stand. It wouldn’t stand, not in my town.

Those go into a temporary list so I can trim later.

First pass is the beans. If the shop roasts in house or pours stuff from a solid roaster like Onyx or Heart, it stays. If I can’t find any mention of the beans online, it’s probably a pass.

Next I look at weekday photos on Google Maps. A steady line at 10 a.m. on a Tuesday usually means locals like the place. Empty room in every shot is a bad sign.

Quick scan on Reddit or a local food blog helps too. One or two honest reviews carry more weight than a dozen “Top 10 coffee shops” listicles.

There are a few practical checks: hours (early opens matter), transit or parking, noise level, and whether they welcome laptops. If I’m in town I’ll stop in for a cortado, ask a question, see how the staff handles it. When that’s not possible, I lean on trusted locals for a *sample* visit.

Red flags and green flags at a glance:

* House roast or named roaster → keep
* Crowd on weekday mornings → keep
* Only appears on SEO listicles → drop

I met him at his gym yesterday, he was there early when I arrived. We went around the gym doing different workouts and had great conversation. Laughed a lot, made jokes, etc. I was expecting to be there for no more than an hour, but time flew by and we were there for 2.5 hours. Agreed to do another gym date again afterward and now he's posting on socials and not answering my messages, so I feel like I'm looking at another ghosting situation.

I have been struggling most of my life with certain types of fatigue and brain fog that has made life significantly more difficult. I’ve been to the doctor numerous times over the years and had blood work done that resulted in the doctors saying they seem normal and that’s the end of discussion. I’ve personally tried so many different lifestyle choices to see what could help without clear improvements. (Exercising, keto, vegetarian, so many supplements) These symptoms may or may not be related but they seem to coincide with each other at some point:

Pre puberty and puberty: 

Migraines

Passing out while standing (I would start to get tunnel vision and muscle weakness before losing consciousness. I knew to sit down when this happened and I would get suddenly very nauseous)

Extreme fatigue even when it seemed like I had enough sleep. 

(I was healthy, physically fit and about 100 pounds at 18)

Ongoing, lifelong symptoms:

Brain fog when tired and overstimulated resulting in inability to think and sometimes causing slurring and stuttering (feels like my mouth doesn’t work as well), blurry vision or very teary eyed, heavy brain/head feeling. Lots of yawning.
Saying words that don’t make sense and realizing it after the fact.

Muscle weakness in the morning when standing that can last hours. I constantly feel like I need to sit down during this time and forcing myself to be upright causes the above symptoms to worsen. (I have strong legs normally)

Tight throat. Feels like a dry ball stuck in there. I’ve always assumed it was anxiety related.

Heavy chest. Sometimes it feels like I need to work harder to breathe. 

Faster than normal heart rate I think. My resting is 80-90 and is easily 120+ with normal activity. This was the case even as a runner and I found it very difficult to keep my heart rate out of the “danger zone” even when I was physically fit. 

Physically feeling my heart pound.

Seeing sparkly things if I look too far to the left or right. (Oddly I have not noticed this lately)

Cold fingers and toes almost always. Splotchy skin when cold or standing awhile. 

Newer symptoms:

Ongoing on and off low grade fever. 99-100.1 (I used to track my temperature for fertility and I always had standard 98.6 average temp)

Buzzing/tingling feet. Not quite like the going to sleep feeling. Hard to describe because it’s similar but different. It feels worse when laying down at night but it can be present at anytime. Sometimes it’s not present but I have not figured out a correlation yet. 

Random sweating. (Pretty sure I’m not premenopausal yet. My periods are still very normal and regular to the day.)



All of these symptoms are worse during my luteal phase making life almost unmanageable but are present almost always. 
I have very short lived relief when using stimulants, mainly coffee most of my life but have turned to Adderall for the past year. They are the worst in the morning to afternoon. Evenings are usually a sweet spot of normalcy before I get tired from the day. I’ve had depression and anxiety my entire life but I also feel like fighting these symptoms and the shame has contributed to that. I feel less anxious and depressed when I’m not feeling guilty for not being productive enough. 

Physicals and blood tests have always been in the normal range with some things being a little higher or lower within the normal range such as vitamin d or iron. Glucose tests did not reveal diabetes but my blood sugar levels seem to be on the higher side of normal. Same with blood pressure. Going to the doctor has always left me feeling like these things are all in my head and I’m just a baby because everyone deals with these symptoms at times. What other symptoms might I need to look out for that could help narrow down diagnoses? My goal is to get some idea of what type of things I could be doing to help relieve these symptoms because the normal health advice of diet and exercise has not changed much. I understand that a real diagnosis is not possible here but I welcome any educated speculation.

So, I decided to review some of my mechpens, and perhaps, someone else may find it useful.  But before I posted anything, maybe it would be interesting to explain how I’ll tackle these reviews. A review, even a well-done objective one, is eminently personal, so I think some context is important.

First thing I do after I get a new pencil, I ditch the original lead, and swap it for something that I know well. That being so, I *always* use Pentel’s **Ain 2B**, to keep things constant - *except* for 0.5 mm, where I’m using Ain Stein **4B**. I then use the pencil for around a week – however, though I do write a LOT at work, I mostly use pens. So that “week of use” is mainly small stuff, like (very) short notes and scribbles and diddles. After I got familiar with the pencil, I’ll then write the review proper by hand. However, before writing the review, I do the “technical part”: measurements and weighing. I measure the pencil’s overall length and diameter (at the grip) using a steel ruler and a caliper. To weigh it, I use a very precise coffee scale. Weighing done, I calculate the CG (center of gravity). Nothing fancy, I just place it atop an Ain lead case to see at what length (from the tip) it becomes stable.

With that information in hand, I’ll start the actual review. I write the review by hand, to get the measure of how the pencil feels when used extensively. Remember, not always I was able to use the pencil for a more extensive period in one go. Moreover, I write the reviews using the same back board every time and of course, using the pencil I’m reviewing. I do it this way to try to make things as constant as possible for all pencils, to keep things fair. That or I have OCD, though I think the first possibility is more charming.

A couple weeks ago I wrote the first one – just dotted down what I thought about the pen. However, when I went to proof-read, I decided that I should focus on six main points. The first four are all objectives: materials, eraser, measurements and features. The remaining two are subjective, yet perhaps the most important: aesthetics and ergonomics. Interestingly, though the most variable, the last two are probably the most important aspects. In other words, did I like it or not, and why.

With the review written on paper, I photograph the pencil, trying to show aspects of it that I thought important. I then “translate” the text to a digital form, so that you don’t have to use a Rosetta stone to understand my hand-written squiggles. With the text and photos ready I’ll upload here, loosely in a chronological order (from oldest to newest acquisition).

So, there you have it. My way of trying to pay back the community for all the stuff that I learned online. After all, we’re all just trying to answer the question that defines the uncertainty of human life on this Earth: *“Should I buy this mechanical pencil or not?”*

# Best Light Cream 2025: Reviews & Ultimate Buying Guide

Light cream is a versatile dairy product that adds richness and flavor to a variety of culinary applications without the high fat content of heavier creams. It is indeed an essential ingredient for coffee,sauces,desserts,and even savory dishes,offering a delicate balance between texture and taste. For consumers seeking to enhance their culinary experiences while being mindful of their dietary intake, choosing the right light cream is crucial.

in this guide, we will explore the top light creams available in 2025, examining their key features, benefits, and ideal user profiles.We'll also address common questions and provide buying recommendations to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated light cream on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=light cream)

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of light cream involves several considerations beyond fat content.Factors like taste, texture, processing methods, and shelf life substantially impact the overall user experience. Understanding these features is critical for selecting a light cream that perfectly suits your needs.

**Fat Content:** Light cream, as defined by the FDA, typically contains between 18% and 30% milkfat. This lower fat content, compared to heavy cream or whipping cream, makes it a lighter option for those watching their caloric intake or preferring a delicate flavor. The precise percentage can vary slightly between brands, so it's always best to check the product label.

A lower percentage of fat means a less rich,but also a less heavy product. For applications were a subtle creamy flavor is desired, a light cream with a lower fat percentage might potentially be preferable.

**Pasteurization and Processing:** Most commercially available light creams are pasteurized to eliminate harmful bacteria and extend shelf life. Some brands may also utilize ultra-pasteurization (UHT), which further extends the shelf life by heating the cream to a higher temperature. However, UHT processing can sometimes affect the taste, resulting in a slightly cooked flavor.

Additionally, some light creams may contain stabilizers, such as carrageenan, to prevent separation and maintain a smooth consistency. Consumers who prefer all-natural products may want to seek out brands that avoid these additives.

**Taste and Texture:** The best light creams offer a smooth, velvety texture and a clean, creamy taste. There shouldn't be any off-flavors or a grainy texture. The flavor should subtly enhance othre ingredients without overpowering them.

The taste can be influenced by the cow's diet and the cream's freshness. Opting for products with minimal additives often results in a purer, more natural taste.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** Light cream is commonly available in refrigerated cartons or aseptic packaging. The type of packaging affects its shelf life; aseptic packaging typically allows for a longer unrefrigerated shelf life until opened. Once opened, light cream should be stored in the refrigerator and used within a week for optimal freshness.Consumers should check the ""use by"" or ""sell by"" date on the packaging to ensure they are purchasing a fresh product. It's also vital to store the light cream properly in the refrigerator to prevent spoilage.

## Core Benefits

Light cream offers distinct advantages for both culinary enthusiasts and everyday consumers. Its versatility, ease of use, and health-conscious composition make it a kitchen staple.

**Versatile Culinary Applications:** Light cream can be used in a wide range of recipes, from enriching coffee and tea to adding creaminess to sauces and soups. It's also a popular ingredient in desserts,such as custards,puddings,and ice cream,where it provides a lighter option to heavy cream.

Unlike heavier creams, light cream doesn't curdle easily when heated, making it suitable for adding to hot dishes. This versatility ensures that light cream can seamlessly integrate into diverse culinary creations.

**Health-Conscious Choice:** compared to heavy cream, light cream has significantly fewer calories and fat per serving, making it a healthier option for those watching their dietary intake. This allows consumers to enjoy creamy textures and flavors without excessive guilt.For individuals with lactose sensitivities, some brands offer lactose-free light cream options, ensuring that everyone can indulge in its culinary benefits.

**Enhanced flavor and Texture:** Light cream enhances the flavor and texture of dishes without overwhelming them. It adds a subtle richness and smoothness that elevates the overall taste experience.

In coffee, light cream provides a creamy consistency that complements the bitterness of the coffee beans.In sauces, it creates a velvety texture that clings to the other ingredients, creating a harmonious blend of flavors.

No, light cream generally does not whip well due to its lower fat content. to achieve whipped cream,you need a cream with a higher fat percentage,such as heavy cream or whipping cream. light cream may form soft peaks with extended whipping but will not hold its shape.

Substituting additives to make it a whippable cream is not advised due to resulting flavor alterations.

**How should I store light cream after opening?**

After opening, light cream should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It's best to consume it within a week to maintain its fresh taste and quality. Always check for any signs of spoilage, such as an off odor or unusual texture, before using.

Refrigeration will not retain or prolong usage for over a week safely based on FDA regulations.

**Is there a difference between light cream and half-and-half?**

Yes, there is a difference. Light cream contains a higher percentage of milkfat (18%-30%) than half-and-half (10.5%-18%). Half-and-half is a mixture of milk and cream, making it lighter than light cream.

The best way to compare is using them in the same recipes to understand the level of creaminess desired.

1kxklmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kxklmr/uncover_if_goodcups_water_filters_truly_improve/,Uncover if GoodCups water filters truly improve your Keurig coffee experience review!,"**My Honest Experience with GoodCups Water Filters and Starter Kit**

Having used the GoodCups Water Filters and Starter Kit for a few months now, my morning coffee routine has undeniably improved. Compatible with a wide range of Keurig models like the K-Supreme, K-Slim, and K-Cafe, this kit caught my attention because of its promise to enhance coffee taste. I drink coffee daily, so naturally, I wanted something that could elevate the flavor and ensure it remains consistent over time. With the included filter holder and twelve replacement filters, this starter pack was well-equipped to support my caffeine habits right from the get-go.

**Design That Speaks Simplicity**

The lightweight design of this kit makes it incredibly functional and easy to integrate into Keurig coffee machines. With dimensions of 8.78"" x 6.02"" x 2.32"", it doesn’t take much space, and the filter holder fits snugly into the side-loaded reservoir of my coffee maker. What surprised me most is how simple it is to install; there are no tools required, just a quick fit—ideal for busy mornings when no one wants to fiddle with a complex setup. Being BPA-free is a big plus, as it assured me of both safety and durability, making it feel like a well-thought-out product right out of the box.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Enhances coffee flavor by removing impurities effectively.  
- Wide compatibility with many Keurig models, ensuring flexibility.  
- BPA-free materials align with safety and eco-consciousness.

**Performance and Coffee Taste**

One morning, I tested it to see if it actually made a difference in coffee taste, inviting over a couple of friends for a brew session. We used the same coffee brand but split it between water run through this filter and unfiltered. The result? A unanimous agreement that the filtered water brew tasted notably smoother. That deeper, richer aroma most certainly brightened everyone's mood. Over time, I’ve also noticed that the enhanced water quality prevents residue buildup in my coffee maker, an unexpected and welcome bonus. 

**Ease of Replacement and Longevity**

Replacing the filters is an absolute breeze. Each one slides out of the holder effortlessly, and popping a new filter back in takes mere seconds. The pack of twelve ensures I’m stocked up and not racing to find a replacement in the middle of making a cup. For a household like mine, with multiple daily coffee drinkers, this longevity and convenience mean fewer trips to the store. I’ve also given one to my coworker, Rachel, who has a K-Classic at work, and she’s as impressed with the ease of use as I am.

**Pitfalls**

- Although compatibility is extensive, users of older Keurig models may need to double-check fit.  
- Filters need to be changed frequently if you brew several pots per day, which could add up over time.  

**Materials and Quality Control**

Premium-quality plastic is at the heart of these filters, which ensures they’re durable yet lightweight. The filters genuinely do a stellar job of holding back sediment and foreign particles, which I’ve verified by inspecting residue in my Keurig afterward—it’s practically spotless. My only gripe is they’re manufactured in China, and while the quality has been nothing short of excellent so far, some consumers might prefer locally-made alternatives.

**Product Comparisons**

Compared to alternatives like Maxware and PUREHQ filters, this starter kit excels. Maxware offers similar BPA-free materials but falls behind due to a slightly bulkier design that’s trickier to install. On the other hand, PUREHQ matches the performance levels but doesn’t include as many extra filters, which makes GoodCups the more economical choice for frequent users like myself. Where this kit might not compete is in price for those who need compatibility across older Keurig models that aren’t side-loaded. It all boils down to one’s specific coffee machine and how often they brew.

**Value Proposition**

For anyone deeply rooted in a morning coffee ritual, the GoodCups starter kit presents great financial value. While you pay for a bundle upfront, the twelve filters last long enough to justify the investment. Those looking to upgrade their coffee quality without splurging on new machines will find this small yet substantial improvement worth every cent. It combines quality-made parts with functionality, making it suitable for budget-conscious coffee addicts and enthusiasts alike.

1kxkiy2,https://i.redd.it/7yea63v35j3f1.jpeg,Melting Forest Mushroom Energy Drink Review - Honest Opinion and Breakdown,"These are not available in Canada so when I saw these at a local convenience store here in Toronto, I had to try them out. I've seen a few reviews on here and they weren't the biggest fans of the drink.. but I'll break down why I am. 

Melting Forest is functional mushroom/adaptogen based brand. They use functional mushrooms like, lions mane, cordyceps, reishi as ingredients to provide additional benefits in addition to botanicals such as ginseng, rosa roxburghii, rhodiola. All of which are 'adaptogens' (natural substances) which help your body adapt to physiological stresses. Because of the use of these ingredients, there will be some taste/flavour that most people are not accustomed to. Normally, some plant, rooty and even bitter like tastes, but honestly, there wasn't much of that in this drink. I've tried some plant based/botanical based drinks that straight up taste like dirt and are worst.

The energy drink comes in 4 flavors. I tried the Orange Cream and Mango Guava. Definitely liked the Orange Cream better. Of note, they also have a 'D-Stress"" line also with 4 flavors, which I have not tried yet but the are drinks intended for relaxation/winding down.

The energy drinks are 12 oz/355ml cans, zero sugar, monkfruit as a sweetener and are only 5 calories. 

*The main functional ingredients the drinks contain are:*  
  
**Organic cordyceps mushroom + organic lions mane mushroom by Immulink.** (Patented branded ingredient extraction process) Cordyceps has been known for providing energy and endurance. While Lions mane is great for brain health and mental performance. What I appreciate the most is that they were transparent by listing 70% beta glucans. This is very important. Beta glucans are the bioactive compounds that provide the health benefits. A lot of brands that use mushrooms in their drinks may use low quality mushrooms with low beta glucans. Therefore, you may not be getting benefits or adaptogenic properties and why some people say mushrooms don't work for them. In my opinion, Ideally, you want high beta glucans and mushroom extract from fruiting bodies.

I find that most mushroom based drinks paired formulated with at least 100mg of caffeine work way better for me from a focus, mental acuity and more sustained energy perspective than an energy drink with 150mg-200mg of caffeine. 

**L-Theanine by Alphawave.** It is an amino acid primarily found in green-tea, often called a nootropic. The amino acid is known for providing mental clarity, memory, focus and calming properties. I've personally used L-theanine as a supplement for anxiety and stress. When it is paired with caffeine, it provides a synergistic and counteracts some of the unwanted effects of caffeine. The mental alertness and energy without the jitters. The 2:1 (caffeine to l-theanine ratio) is a great baseline. 

**Senactiv - Rosa Roxburghii and Panax Ginseng by Nuliv Science:** Senactiv is again is a branded ingredient from Nuliv Science. Panax ginseng is one of the OG and probably one of the most common functional ingredient in energy drinks as it combats fatigue and increasing energy levels. Rosa Roxburghii is a botanical/flower. The bioactive components in the botanical are for antioxidant, aiding metabolic and energy systems at a cellular level as opposed to from a stimulant. I first came across in tea before but It is actually a very common ingredient in the active nutrition and fitness space for non stim pre-workouts and even BCAA's for recovery.

**Green Coffee Bean for caffeine:** Instead of using synthetic caffeine, they use green coffee bean which often has a slower release vs a quicker/stronger effect that leads to a crash. Which I personally prefer. 

The formulation in the drink using branded patented ingredients (Immulink, Alphawave and Senactiv) tells me, they put a lot of thought into it and wanted something high quality. It certainly is an energy drink that is 'better-for-you'.

Hello! 
So my bf has a multitude health issues and he has had serious scares before and I didn’t find out he was in the hospital until a few days later when he was able to get a hold of me. 
I don’t worry too much since he’s busy in the day time so him not messaging me is normal. However, the problem comes at night time. There have been numerous times he has made plans to talk to me or says he’s not tired and then stops responding suddenly. It always worries me and we have tried to come up with a plan to help ensure I know he’s safe. 
For example, we considered: location tracking on phone but he tends to remain at home most of the time and doesn’t let me know is he’s hurt or not or lost his phone. Video security cameras but he lives with other people and we don’t want to invade their privacy and know they are HIGHLY against them. Same with audio devices (along with the fact if something happens I won’t be able to tell if he’s ok if I don’t hear anything so that’s not the best solution). Touch bracelets that vibrate when the other person touches it but he’s a HEAVY sleeper and said if I press it repeatedly and he’s dead tired it would probably annoy him and he’d take it off without thinking. And him sending me a message before he passes out but it hasn’t worked out in the past (to an extent he has narcolepsy and tough sleep issues- like struggling to stay awake/insomnia that isn’t conscious/sleep walking and eating/taking about an hour before being able to operate after waking up even with coffee/etc etc) He also tends to bounce between sleeping in his room and in the living room shared space. And since he struggles so much waking up in the morning and gets absorbed in other working tasks he doesn’t always get on his phone to let me know he’s alright. 
So my question would be what could we do so I can know he’s not unresponsive due to a health issue?

TLDR: My bf has health problems and tends to go MIA at night when we aren’t in person (despite plans to talk/him saying he’s not too tired/etc). I don’t believe he’s cheating since he’s consistent with what I’ve seen of him in person so it’s not that. My question is what can we do to let me know he’s alright when he goes MIA at night? 
We have already discussed and found issues with: video/audio in his home. Location tracking on phone. Touch bracelets. Him sending me messages that he’s going to sleep. 

Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. We’re struggling to find a solution. Thank you in advance! 🧡",1,1748447118.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’ve tried grinding from 0.7 (near the lower end of Honest Coffee Guides recommendations) to 1.2 (the higher end) in 0.1 increments and it stays tasting sour. Anything below 0.8 is too fine so it takes nearly a minute to achieve 1:2 ratio. Above 1.0 was the opposite. I’ve tried going for ratios from 1:2 to 1:3. I’ve tried increasing the temperature by turning on the steam wand to heat the boiler. I’ve tried stopping the brew to pre infuse the grounds (per Lance’s video). I even tried a light roast to see if it was just the beans. The beans I’ve been using were roasted end of March but they’ve been in an airscape and I’ve had no issues getting a good crema on top. I just can’t seem to get away from the sour/salty taste. I’ve had espresso before, it’s been a while, but I don’t remember it being this sour.

My next step is to go to an independent coffee shop/roaster and try an espresso again just to sense check whether it’s me or my brewing. In the mean time any tips would be appreciated.",1,1748447095.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I love quiet weekends at home watching movies, arguing over our favorite shows, rolling dice for D&D campaigns, binge-watching anime, playing video games, and making pancakes on Sunday mornings. I also dream of exploring the world together, growing and broadening our horizons together.

I’m looking for someone who shares my sense of wonder, shares my love of coffee, and is ready to love me even at my worst. My friends say I’m the life of the party and super friendly, but here’s the catch (or bonus?): I live in Japan, where it’s been a challenge to find someone to settle down with. One day, I’d love to move out of Japan and start fresh somewhere new.

If this sounds like your vibe, let’s chat and see where it goes! Fingers crossed I finally meet my prince. 💕

1kxkdrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1kxkdrd/is_a_low_carb_vegan_diet_healthy/,is a low carb vegan diet healthy?,"A vegetarian or carnist low carb diet would neither be natural nor healthy is my view, since it would be likely to be high in saturated fat (+ trans fat in dairy?) and besides it's not like our ancestors were eating dairy and domesticated animals. (Game meat is usually lean.)

But what about a high fat low carb vegan diet? Many fatty vegan options are kind of thought of as healthy options. Avocado, nuts, chocolate, coconut, the list goes on and on. I don't really get what they mean when they say you can't be a low carb vegan?

Is it healthy though? Is it natural? Is keto a healthy state to be in?

Following this diet I have lost a lot of weight and I feel ok, however the reason I'm following the diet isn't mainly to get into keto. I just really like to avoid sugar because I have really struggled for a long time with dental health and managing my oral hygiene is just a lot easier this way. (That's not to say I never eat bread or carbs.)

So some examples of what I actually eat? Okay so I'm Swedish and I'm fond of fika / sweet treats. So I make vegan chocolate ball which is basically vegetable fat, sugar (or sweetener), rolled oats, cocoa, coffee, and you roll it into delicious balls. I don't know if it's keto, but it's low in sugar. And I enjoy this with a vegan matcha latte, home-made.

Maybe a better example would be salad with whipped tahini and fried tofu? Anyhow I also eat normal meals, but not every day kind of and I don't really have the goal of going into keto, just trying to overall lower my sugar intake I'd say. I also frequently have chia pudding or coconut yoghurt.

1kxkc9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1kxkc9c/trip_report_warning_long_dublin_donegal_galway/,"Trip report (warning, LONG): Dublin, Donegal, Galway","Big thanks to the fine people of this sub and r/galway! We had a wonderful trip for our 20th anniversary. Ireland, you remain magnificent. Some (exceedingly long-winded) thoughts here, in case they are helpful to anyone planning future visits.

  
**Trip length/itinerary:** 7 days. Arrived Sunday morning, left the following Saturday (flight was cheaper vs. leaving on a Friday night). This wasn't ideal because a lot of restaurants are closed on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays, and some sights are closed Sunday or Monday. We found places to eat but if you're wanting to go to a specific restaurant, aim for Thurs-Sat. We spent 2 nights in Dublin, 1 in Donegal, and 3 in Galway.

  
**General:** 3 different lodgings in 6 nights was too much for us. Believe everyone here who says don't try to do a lot or change hotels every night. We really prefer to settle in and enjoy places at a slower pace, and we thought this wouldn't be too much, but it was. If you love to be on the go every day and never being sure where you put that tube of sunscreen or the extra charging cord, then have at it, I guess, but don't say I didn't warn you. Driving remains extremely challenging even though this time we knew what to expect. It wears you out mentally to have to pay such close attention, as a driver and even as a passenger. There are even more American tourists around than I remembered from last time, which was annoying even though I (being American) am obviously part of the problem. Sorry! But this is why you should try to spend time chatting with locals, otherwise it doesn't feel too different from home. Disconcerting to hear more American accents than Irish around you in the street or in restaurants, and god do we stand out with our hideous t-shirts and cargo shorts and baseball caps. Ah well. 

  
**Restaurants:** we had some outstanding meals thanks to recommendations from folks here. 



Dublin: Sunday lunch at Hawksmoor was delicious, the waiter was friendly, and they even comped us a creme brûlée for our anniversary. Very cool setting, maybe an old bank or something? Felt glamorous. Dinner at BANG was outstanding, probably my fave meal of the trip. Thelma, the hostess (or manager?) was unbelievably friendly and fun to chat with. She said we were actually 1 of 3 other couples celebrating anniversaries that night. We had some delicious and filling salads at Tiller and Grain, not far from Trinity College. Also enjoyed sitting outside for dinner at Dada for Moroccan food. A guy nearby was filming content for his YouTube or whatever, dressed in a suit that made him look like leaves in one of the cement planters, holding still and then startling people as they went by. We felt a little bad for laughing, but it was entertaining. (Luckily, no one had a heart attack, he chose his victims wisely. If you're that guy, drop a link to your video, I'd enjoy seeing it.) Stopped in at The International for a drink and the bartender gave me a quite generous pour on my single whiskey. Not sure if he does that for everyone, or if he approved of my drink choice (Teeling single grain, neat--I may have inadvertently made an ""oh god no"" face when he asked if I wanted ice). I would have enjoyed a chat with him but most of the stools were outside so people could enjoy the weather, and after a day of walking around I needed to sit.

  
Donegal: dinner at Harvey's Point, where we also spent the night. The vibe of the restaurant and hotel was very ""fancy place you stay at when your grandparents take you on a family vacation,"" so I was not expecting the food to be so modern and delicious. Looked like something you'd see in a magazine! Breakfast buffet had a ton of options, including a separate area with gluten free items. They seemed like they were being pretty careful to avoid cross-contamination, which is nice to see. Lots of fruit on the buffet, including the best stewed prunes I've ever had in my life. People joke about prunes but I'm here to tell you, they are so underrated. I commented on them to our server and she said they were stewed with Madeira, and I was like ""Well THAT explains it."" They also had cinnamon sticks and other spices nestled among them. No lie, I am going to reminisce about these prunes for the rest of my life, ha ha.

  
Galway: delicious dinner at Ard Bia, but unfortunately we couldn't enjoy it as much as we'd hoped, because my husband wasn't feeling great and it was very hot in the restaurant since we were seated upstairs. Ireland is built to keep warmth \*in\*, so global warming is making it hard on places that normally wouldn't have to worry about AC in freaking May. We didn't see any AC units but maybe they have fans in summer? Be aware if you're like me and run hot. We also had dinner at Brasserie on the Corner--I had wanted to eat here on our previous visit and couldn't, so this was my chance, Sorry to say, it was not worth the expectations! Perfectly good food with very friendly and efficient service, also seemed accustomed to big groups if you need that. It was totally standard Irish food, tasty and nothing wrong with it, but by then we had had so many other good meals that it definitely fell short in comparison. Great Indian food at Kumar's, thanks to u/Excellent-Current-85 for this. They were right that this place doesn't rely as heavily on cream and butter as the ""standard"" Indian restaurants. Food was more like our fave place at home, delicious and didn't make us feel weighted down. Only other customers were a Southeast Asian guy and a small group that looked like a white guy with his Southeast Asian wife and her mother, seemed like a good sign. We went to Esquires for breakfast one morning, which was very busy and service was a bit erratic, but food was good. A nicer breakfast at Caprice, but we arrived at about 9:40 to be told they would start serving at 10:30 but we could come in and have coffee. It's on me for not realizing they don't open until 10 (do people stay out late in Galway? why does breakfast start so late??), but why he didn't tell us to come back at 10, I don't know. When we arrived at 10:20 after walking around for a bit, there were people already seated and eating! Who knows. Cappuccino here was weak too, maybe I need to switch to flat white in Ireland, ha ha. We didn't eat at Monroe's, but the food that went by smelled great, and the trad music on Friday afternoon was an absolutely unbeatable scene, best experience of the trip. Thanks to Galway Girl on the Run (sorry I can't find your actual username!) for this rec. I wasn't able to say hi to Tony for you, he was busy. :-) Once again I did not manage to eat a spice bag or chicken fillet roll, super bummed about this. Clearly I just need to plan another visit!

  
**Lodging:** We wanted to splurge for our anniversary, so these aren't budget places. But everyone here who said The Westbury in Dublin is overpriced for what you get is correct, alas. We stayed at their sister property, The Bloomsbury Hotel, in London and loved it, but The Westbury is not quite up to the same standard. The room was small and stuffy, and it felt like the toilet was going to fall off the wall when you sat down. (It turned out to be just the seat being loose or broken, but it was quite disconcerting at 2 am when I woke up all jet lagged and thought I was about to cause a major plumbing emergency.) The flush was also weak, which is common in Europe (you usually have to hold down the handle for awhile), but in this case even holding the handle down didn't always get the job done. It was impossible to figure out how to turn on the AC and there were no instructions on paper or in the QR code. (We lucked out with weather and that warm spell, so we really needed the AC!) We asked at the desk and they explained it, but it also shut off partway through the night so we woke up hot every night. No USB jacks in the room, not even at the base of the lamps, which is the easiest way to add them in an old building if you can't rewire it. We did enjoy the turndown service and the way housekeeping beautifully tidied my ridiculous quantity of skincare products. Breakfast buffet was excellent, although the cappuccino was super weak, just get the coffee if you need that caffeine onslaught like I do. Stewed prunes here too, just the normal kind but yummy. Very beautiful setting, if you want a lovely afternoon tea this would be a great place to go. We wouldn't stay here again, we love fancy surroundings but I think we'll look for something more modern (and cheaper) next time. 

Harvey's Point in Donegal was old-school, and the giant suite we had felt super luxe in a slightly gaudy '80s way, but I found that rather charming. No AC here, but there was a fan in the room. I hate to think what it would be like in July, it's really a bummer that climate change is having such an impact. This would be the perfect place to stay for a big family reunion. It felt like it was run by a family who really cares about giving guests a good experience. Lakeside setting was idyllic. I would stay here again if I was in the area and wanted to spend this much, otherwise I'd stay nearby but eat at the restaurant.

  
The Galmont in Galway: by far our least favorite hotel, I would never stay here again. It's probably the perfect place if you're in Galway on business, I'll say that. At least a 15-20-minute walk from Shop Street or the West End (my favorite part of Galway), which doesn't sound like a lot, but when you've been walking all day it's tough to walk even more just to get to dinner. I guess we could have taken a cab, but asking a cabbie to make a 5 minute trip feels embarrassing lol. I woke up early one morning and decided I might as well go to the gym, then found out it doesn't open until 7 am! Is this like how the breakfast joints open late? I failed to realize how close this hotel is to the train and bus stations, never a great sign. Neighborhood was pretty soulless, as was the hotel. Staff were friendly but maybe need more training. I asked for feather-free bedding and it was promised but never arrived. Housekeeping was extremely haphazard--not sure if we were supposed to put out the ""please service room"" tag, but when we came back to the room at 5:30 the first day, it hadn't been cleaned. When they did clean it, they did the bare minimum, and were inconsistent about replacing the bottled waters and milk for the coffee. They seemed to be servicing rooms throughout the day--no matter when we came to the room, there were bags of used linens and housekeeping carts in the hallway. Obviously not that big a deal, it's a large hotel and I'm sympathetic to anyone who has to clean rooms all day, bless them. But it felt like this could have been managed more efficiently, and that's on the higher-ups, not the cleaners. This hotel also had a ton of big tour groups, who seem universally to lack situational awareness. Maybe don't stand directly in front of the elevators if you're not getting on!! If you stay here, definitely don't get the rate the includes breakfast. It was OK but certainly not worth 25 euros, we only got it our first day because we were tired and didn't want to have to figure out where else to go. Keep in mind that to go anywhere else requires at least a 5 minute walk. There's a Scon outpost that had excellent scones and pastries but that's all they have, if you want anything more substantial you have to go elsewhere. I wouldn't stay here again, but if I did I would work harder at figuring out where to eat.

  
This post is already way too long and sounds like SO MUCH COMPLAINING, but I guess I want to keep others from making the same mistakes I did! I adore Ireland and I'm looking forward to going back again, because every trip adds data points that will help me make the next trip even better. At least, I hope. I won't go into the sights we visited since I've already written a whole dissertation, but we loved Slieve League and Bru na Boinne and found Trinity College/Book of Kells Experience less Disneyfied than I feared. Recommend all 3. This sub loves to snark on Dublin but we liked it quite a lot. It's a city and it's packed with Americans, but there's a ton to do and see, and it's lovely, with great parks.

Till we meet again, Ireland! I love you!!!

Gets a little worse driving in.  I was at work telling my co workers about it. Slight pain that got worse throughout morning on lower right side abdomen. 
Co workers were making me feel like I was overreacting and all that good stuff. (So annoying)

Went to urgent care at 10am and after a CT scan and urine test it was acute appendicitis. So pretty inflamed. Urgent care transferred me to the hospital. Surgeon said mine was 10mm when a normal one is as skinny as a small worm. 

 Arrived at hospital around 130pm Operation started at around 4pm, took 45 minutes then recovering room for 1.5 hours while they monitored me. First time going ""under"" too and I think I did ok. After about another hour in recovery, asked if I wanted to stay or go home tonight. I said go home. They helped me up to the restroom,  felt a little off balance and very sleep but good. My wife took me to the store to get my meds and was sleepy but ok. Got home slept 12 hours and this morning im drinking coffee and eating soft eggs and toast. 

(Last night I just had chicken noodle soup and passed out)

They did give me a torso wrap that helps when I need to clear my throat. Keep its nice and firm so that helps alot of help I think. Its 1030a. Next day and eating is going good.  Just not eating too much. 

Also sore on the incisions areas, mainly the right side one. Will go for a neighborhood walk later today.

1kxkb3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kxkb3r/explore_silonn_slim32twf_nugget_ice_maker_review/,Explore Silonn SLIM32T-WF Nugget Ice Maker Review Is It Worth Buying?,"The Silonn SLIM32T-WF Nugget Ice Maker caught my eye because, let’s be honest, who doesn’t love perfectly crunchy nugget ice in their drinks? I tested it across different scenarios—weekend gatherings, daily iced coffee obsessions, and random moments where ice just makes life better. Featuring a sleek stainless steel design, compact dimensions of 13.6 x 13.6 x 14.8 inches, and boasting a production capacity of 44 pounds per day, it seemed like the ultimate home ice solution. I had high expectations, but does it truly justify its reputation? Let’s dive in.

**Build and Aesthetic Elegance**  
Straight out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how polished and modern it looked. The stainless steel finish gave it a premium feel, blending effortlessly into my kitchen’s aesthetic. Weighing 26.5 pounds, it wasn’t as lightweight as smaller units, but it wasn’t a hassle to position on my countertop either. It’s compact for what it delivers, especially considering its substantial ice-making capacity. My kitchen, which feels perpetually cluttered, welcomed the machine without needing a major rearrangement. I see this as a win for anyone who appreciates functionality meeting style.

**Usability and Smart Features**  
The integration of the Silonn app was a game-changer for me. Scheduling ice production felt futuristic—no rushing to refill trays or realizing you’re out of ice last minute. The timer function worked perfectly when I wanted the ice ready for friends visiting by evening. Plus, status alerts, such as when water is low or when the ice basket is full, spared me from constantly checking on it. My sister even joked that my ice maker is smarter than her fridge. Silonn clearly targeted the forgetful multitaskers among us, and it works brilliantly!

[Find the best price for Silonn SLIM32T-WF on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cypxhyfx/)  

**Performance and Speed**  
When I put it to the test, it didn’t disappoint. Within just 10 minutes, I had a fresh batch of those irresistible nugget-sized ice pellets. The ice feels soft, almost chewable, and doesn’t dilute drinks too quickly—a perfect complement for my midday cold brews or evening cocktails. However, I did notice it slows a bit when nearing full capacity. In terms of daily output, 44 pounds is more than enough for even a big household or hosting events. During a family barbecue, the ice production kept pace with everyone’s constant refills, and that’s saying something! 

**Convenience at Its Core**  
The removable basket and pull-out water tank made using this model incredibly convenient. Refilling water took minimal effort, and I didn’t have to move the whole machine to get it done. Emptying the basket was even easier, especially during gatherings where ice needed frequent replenishment. Its self-cleaning feature was another star; a simple button press kick-starts the cleaning process. While I still wiped down the removal parts afterward, it drastically cut down my maintenance time. This feature alone might make it a favorite for those with busy schedules.

**Advantages**  
- Compact, stainless steel design blends easily with modern kitchen aesthetics  
- Smart functionality via the app (scheduling, status alerts) is innovative and helpful  
- Quickly produces nugget ice in just 10 minutes  
- Large daily capacity handles heavy demand  
- Self-cleaning function and removable tanks streamline maintenance  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Its weight (26.5 pounds) may not be as portable as expected for some users  
- Slows down slightly when nearing maximum capacity  
- Generates quite a bit of humming noise during operation  

**Challengers in the Ice Game**  
When placing this unit alongside its competitors, like the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker or the NewAir Nugget Ice Machine, a few differences stood out. While the Silonn unit shines in its smart functionality and compact design, the GE model arguably has a quieter operation. On the other hand, the NewAir felt bulkier and required a lot more counter space in comparison. Silonn’s self-cleaning feature worked smoother than either competitor, but it’s worth noting the GE Opal had a more pronounced focus on aesthetics. Overall, the Silonn strikes a balance between performance, price, and ease.

**Worth Every Penny**  
It boils down to what you’re looking for in an ice maker. For its features—smart scheduling, app controls, self-cleaning function, and a high-quality build—the price feels justified. While it’s more of an investment than basic ice makers, the level of convenience and efficiency it delivers makes it worth considering. For heavy ice users or those who simply love the texture and utility of nugget ice, it checks a lot of boxes without breaking the bank.

A year ago, around the same time, I noticed what looked like coffee grounds on the floor. It lasted for a few days and then suddenly stopped so I didn’t do anything about it. At the same time we were getting our windows changed to impact so there was a lot of banging, I figured it had something to do with that. Now, at the beginning of this month I found the same thing on the ground on the same spot (Pic 1). This time, we happen to have just gotten a new roof there there was a lot of construction and banging on the walls again. It happened maybe 1-2 more times and stopped so I thought it was a coincidence from all the work being done. All of a sudden, this morning I noticed a bunch of wings in the same spot and dead insects nearby (see pics). I googled and it is looking like it’s been termites all along? I have an inspection scheduled next week and I want to take care of this sooner than later. Based on anyone else’s experience, would the only solution be fumigation? I was hoping maybe spot treatment because I won’t have the funds to do a fumigation at this time, and also have a 185 gallon saltwater tank that can’t be moved or properly sealed.

First of all, **I owe you all an apology.** If you installed my DC Universe or Star Wars Universe catalog addons using the links I previously shared, those links have stopped working. I didn't update everyone when the deployment broke, and I know many of you have been experiencing broken catalogs as a result. I'll provide the new links at the end of this post.

After creating the DC Universe and Star Wars Universe catalog addons, I've been working on a different type of project: the **Nuvio Streaming Addon** for Stremio.

Unlike my previous catalog-focused addons, this one is a scraper that attempts to find and deliver streams from various online sources. As with any scraper addon, please understand that reliability depends on external providers that may change or become unavailable over time.

# About this addon:

* **Limited Providers** \- Currently includes only two providers which may break at any time
* **Content Availability** \- Attempts to find streams for movies and TV shows when available
* **High Quality Support** \- One provider supports 4K, HDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision content when available
* **Experimental Nature** \- This is a work in progress with no guarantee on how long it will last
* **Indie Development** \- As a solo developer, I'll try to fix or replace broken providers, but it may take time
* **No Guarantees** \- Use with the understanding that functionality can change or disappear without warning
* **No P2P Technology** \- This addon does not use torrents or P2P connections of any kind

>**Important Note:** This addon is highly experimental and currently relies on just two providers that could stop working at any moment. As an indie developer, I'll do my best to maintain it, but please have realistic expectations about its reliability and longevity.

**Disclaimer:** This is a personal project intended for educational purposes.

# Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?**  
A: No. This addon only scrapes direct HTTP streams from websites. It does not use P2P, torrents, or any technology that would expose your IP address to other users.

**Q: Is this addon safe to use?**  
A: The addon itself is just a scraper that finds links. It doesn't host any content.

**Q: Why do some streams not work?**  
A: The providers this addon scrapes from can change their websites or go offline at any time. When this happens, streams will stop working until I can update the addon.

**Q: How often is the addon updated?**  
A: As an indie developer with limited time, I update when I can. If a provider breaks, I'll try to fix it or find a replacement, but this may take time.

**Q: Will more providers be added?**  
A: I hope to add more providers over time to improve reliability, but this depends on finding stable sources that can be integrated.

**Q: Can I self-host this addon or contribute to development?**  
A: The repository is private for various reasons. If you're interested in self-hosting or development, please send me a DM and we can discuss access.

**Q: Are there any bandwidth limitations?**  
A: Some providers have monthly bandwidth limitations. The addon implements certain optimizations to help with this. In the future, I may add more customization options for users who want to maximize their streaming experience. With the current implementation, users may occasionally experience slower streaming speeds.

If you encounter issues, you can DM me or comment below. Please understand that it may take time to find solutions or alternative providers. I'll work on fixes when I can, but as this is a side project with limited resources, patience is appreciated.

After finally having a few days migraine free I had probably the worst attack of my life yesterday. I’m 23F and have had chronic migraines on and off since I was 8. I’ve been prescribed various meds but haven’t found anything really effective. I’ve been suffering with intractable migraines for about two months. I currently take Triptans but I absolutely hate them. 

11pm- I was starting to have a migraine after dinner. Figured I’d just sleep it off 

7am- I woke up with a horrible burning pain behind my right eye. Emailed my professor that I’d miss class, slept a little and woke up again in even worse pain. I was almost completely blinded in that eye. The pain was so bad I couldn’t talk or move. I couldn’t open my eyes and the side of my head felt like it was being stabbed by a hot poker over and over. I was in and out of consciousness for a while. I tried just about everything in my arsenal - meds, liquid IV, THC, meditation, ice and hot shower… 

1pm- I felt somewhat ok with dull pain at about a 5 for a while and managed to go with my boyfriend to a doctor’s appointment he was worried about. I’m used to pushing through migraines so I thought that day would be no different. But after I drank a coffee on the way home hoping it would help , which was the first thing besides water I’d been able to put in my stomach, the pain became awful again and I started vomiting the second I stepped out of the car. I threw up in the bushes outside my apartment building, just outside the door and in the elevator on the way up to the apartment. I was dizzy , had vomit in my hair and on my clothes and in so much pain I could only collapse in bed still dry heaving.  I tried to eat something bland and rest, threw up again and the pain was unbearable. It felt like it completely consumed me, like I was just a vessel for it. It didn’t matter anymore where I was whether my eyes were open or close what position I lay in - searing, blinding pain tore through my head and my entire vision blurred. My legs and hands tingled and I had chills running through my body. I couldn’t stop dry heaving and with each cough and heave a new wave of pain hit. 

6pm- I finally asked my boyfriend to take me to the Urgent Care down the street that has my insurance on file. In I went with my ice hat and sunglasses. Doctor decided to give me Zofrwn and a shot of Toradol. While waiting for the shot I was slumped over in the exam chair, writhing, twitching and moaning in pain. I think this is the first time in my life I can say my pain was at a 10. Doctor came back and said something about the shot going in my hip but I was so out of it nothing registered and I thought it was going in my thigh so I pulled my pants halfway down (I didnt need to). I got the shot. It BURNED SO BAD. My legs were on fire on top of my head still exploding and I started crying out and sobbing with pain. I genuinely felt at rock bottom at that moment, terrified thinking ‘ what did he even give me what is happening to me’. But after 20 minutes the migraine had dulled to a barely manageable 6 on the pain scale.

8pm- I got home, exhausted and after resting , watching Planet Earth and finally eating some actual food and some ice cream, the pain was gone except for a sore and heavy feeling in my legs. I took a while to fall asleep because I had some adrenaline in my system I guess from the pain or meds. But eventually I did. 

Next day: 

I missed a pretty important school commitment last night and I’m in grad school so that’s not good. I’m not in trouble though and I did send a heads up email so it’s fine. I’m just mad because like I hate that this stupid condition is taking over my life. 

I’m embarrassed. About dramatically puking outside my apartment, about how weak I must have looked screaming in pain like that from a simple shot, about unnecessarily pulling down my pants in front of a male doctor because I wasn’t listening, about the whole fucking thing. 

I’m terrified of this happening again. I have a dull headache this morning that doesn’t feel like a migraine more like dehydration or a hangover so I’m chugging water but I’m so fucking drained and just scared of that pain returning. I’m not even sure what the trigger was so it’s scary. Can’t wait to go home after class and have a nap .",3,1748446529.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

Hey TravelTrotters! Just got back from Bangkok, and *wow*—this city is a **vibrant playground** for queer travelers. From glittering drag shows to late-night street eats that slap harder than a runway strut, here’s the tea to make your trip unforgettable (and safe!).  

**✈️ Catch Pride Month Magic**  
June in Bangkok is next-level. Imagine marching shoulder-to-shoulder with thousands in the **Bangkok Pride Parade** (June 1, 2025!). The energy? Pure electric. Rainbow flags, drag queens on floats, and allies cheering you on. Pro tip: Check out **Pattaya Pride** and **Chiang Mai Pride** too if you’re hopping around Thailand.  

**🛌 Crash in Silom—The Queer Hub**  
Silom by day: suits and skyscrapers. Silom by night: *drag queens, neon lights, and sweaty dance floors*. Stay here for easy access to **DJ Station** (iconic club) and **Stranger Bar** (drag shows nightly!), or chill at LGBTQ+ friendly hostels. Proximity to the BTS/MRT means you’re never far from chaos *or* calm.  

**🎤 Drag Shows That’ll Steal Your Wig**  
Bangkok’s drag scene is **legendary**. Head to **House of Heals** for Pangina Heals (yes, *that* Drag Race Thailand queen) and her squad. Or hit **Stranger Bar**—tiny spot, MASSIVE vibes. Shows start every 30 mins, so grab a Singha and let the chaos unfold.  

**🏳️‍🌈 Support Queer-Owned Spots**  
Skip the chains! Hit cafes like **Iconsiam Coffee** or shops in **Siam Square**. During Pride, even malls like **CentralWorld** go full rainbow mode. Your baht goes further when it lifts the community—*and* you’ll snag cooler souvenirs.  

**⚠️ Read the Room, Boo**  
Thailand’s accepting, but PDA isn’t the norm. Keep kisses for the club, not temples. Respect local customs—save the crop tops for Silom, not sacred spaces. Blend fierce pride with cultural smarts.  

**🚨 PSA: Don’t Skimp on Travel Insurance!**  
Adventures are wild, but *so* are flight cancellations or lost luggage. Before you party-hop, **cover your a$$** with reliable travel insurance. My go-to? **[Ektas Travel Insurance](https://ektatraveling.tp.st/d87eNKCY)**—easy claims, 24/7 support. Trust me, you’ll wanna dance worry-free!

So, let’s talk about something I think we can all agree on – **content creation is a beast**. Am I right? 🤪 Between brainstorming ideas, drafting posts, editing, and posting, it sometimes feels like we need a time-turner! But guess what? **AI is here to save the day** in 2025 - your trusty sidekick that helps you work smarter, not harder. Ready to level up those content skills? Here are **5 quick AI shortcuts** that’ll have you churning out killer content like a pro! 

### 1. **Topic Ideation in a Snap** 
Ever stare at a blank screen wondering what on earth to write? AI tools like **ChatGPT** or **Copy.ai** can help you brainstorm topics based on current trends. Just type in a niche or a keyword, and bam! You’ve got a list of engaging ideas. It’s like having a creative partner who never runs out of inspiration. 

### 2. **Effortless Outlining** 
Once you’ve got your topic, what’s next? Outlining! AI can help structure your article. You can ask for points to cover, sections to include, and even a suggested intro. This flow keeps your content organized and saves you time – just think of it as having a personal assistant who knows what you’re thinking.

### 3. **Writing with Flair** 
This one’s a game-changer. Use AI writing assistants to brush up your draft. Not only can they suggest synonyms (goodbye, “nice”), but they can also adapt your tone. Want it conversational, professional, or cheeky? Just ask! It’s like sprinkling a little magic dust on your content to make it shine. ✨

### 4. **Editing Made Easy** 
Trust me, editing doesn’t have to suck. AI tools like **Grammarly** or **Hemingway Editor** don’t just correct grammar; they help with readability and tone adjustments. You can say goodbye to second-guessing your writing, which is a huge time-saver! Just think about how much brain space that frees up for more creative thoughts. 

### 5. **SEO Like a Wizard** 
Want your content to be found? Use AI to guide your SEO strategy. Tools like **SurferSEO** or **Frase** analyze top-ranking pages and suggest keywords and phrases. It’s basically like having a cheat sheet that increases your visibility on Google without all the guesswork. 🎉 Who doesn’t want that coveted top spot? 

---

So, there you have it, folks! With these AI shortcuts, you’re not just keeping up with the times; you’re LEADING the charge in content creation! Imagine posting high-quality stuff with ease, while also having time left over for coffee breaks. ☕ 

Oh, and if you’re serious about stepping up your game, check out this **[educational program](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals)** on AI in content creation. I mean, education never hurt anyone, right?

Chapter 1  
  
The night Liam returned, he brought a naive girl with him.  
  
She couldn't have been more than twenty-one, her canvas sneakers speckled with dirt, but her dress hem was pristinely, almost jarringly clean. The girl smiled at Jade with wide-eyed wonder, like someone who had stumbled out of a small-town bubble into the big city for the first time.  
  
""Wow, you're so gorgeous, ma'am!"" she gushed with childlike enthusiasm.  
  
Jade forced a tight smile, the cigarette between her fingers burned down to the filter, singeing her skin. Despite being only a few years older than this girl, Liam didn't correct the implied age gap. If anything, the smirk playing on his lips only deepened.  
  
For ten years, Jade had been the only woman in Liam's world. One look at this newcomer told her everything she needed to know—her time with him was running out.  
  
Later that night, instead of spending time with his new innocent pet project, he pulled Jade into their hookup spot—the bedroom where they'd shared countless passionate nights.  
  
After they finished, Liam traced his calloused hand along her face, his thumb roughly smudging her lipstick across her mouth.  
  
""You can handle being my dirty little secret without a commitment,"" he said bluntly. ""But she's different.""  
  
As Liam buttoned up his shirt, Jade inhaled his scent—that intoxicating mix of cigarettes and tequila—the smell that had been her drug for years.  
  
""When I pulled Riley out of that sketchy alley yesterday,"" he continued, ""she just grabbed my hand and kept calling me 'mister' in this super innocent way.""  
  
""Nobody's ever had the guts to come at me like that.""  
  
His fingers tangled in Jade's sweat-dampened hair.  
  
""She's nothing like you.""  
  
Jade stared blankly at the ceiling. ""Because she's all pure and untouched?""  
  
""Hell, she probably doesn't even know what blood looks like.""  
  
""But you...""  
  
He fixed her with that terrifyingly empty stare she knew too well.  
  
""First time I laid eyes on you, your hands were still dripping with that old perv's blood.""  
  
That old bastard had tried to force himself on her when she was fifteen. That's why she has to kill him.  
  
A bitter laugh bubbled up in Jade's throat. How fucking perfect—her ride-or-die loyalty had become her pink slip, while that ""mentally challenged"" innocence had become a trophy worth protecting.  
  
Memories crashed through her mind: the cold sweat down her spine the first time she helped Liam smuggle goods across state lines, the knife-like agony when she drank herself into the ER taking shots meant for him, all those nights she pretended not to notice when he flirted with other women right in front of her.  
  
The vanity mirror didn't lie—tangled hair, raccoon eyes, her skin littered with fresh hickeys and bruises.  
  
""I'm getting married,"" Liam announced like he was discussing the weather. ""You can still be 'Jade' around the crew, same as always.""  
  
Jade finally broke, unleashing a laugh that bordered on unhinged. She could take a bullet for him in a shootout, but couldn't put her name on a marriage certificate.  
  
""Liam, you're a next-level piece of shit, you know that?""  
  
His mouth quirked up in that infuriating smirk.  
  
""Yeah, and you've always known exactly who I am. Riley moves in tomorrow. You're out tonight.""  
  
The door closed with barely a sound, but it might as well have been a bomb detonating in her chest.  
  
She curled into a ball, face pressed into the pillow that still smelled like his cologne.  
  
Weirdly, the tears wouldn't come. She'd spent years convincing herself she was bulletproof, only to discover that her heart could actually shatter into a million pieces.  
  
Jade unlocked her phone and scrolled to her underground contact—the one who specialized in making people disappear. Liam would never just let her walk away—faking her death was her only ticket out.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Liam—a man who'd avoided anything remotely wholesome his entire life—now spent every weekend with Riley riding carousels and Ferris wheels, his hands full of cotton candy and stupid heart-shaped balloons.  
  
When she accidentally smeared chocolate ice cream all over his $200,000 Patek Philippe watch, he didn't even flinch—just wiped it clean with a napkin and asked if she wanted another scoop.  
  
Even when Riley wandered into Liam's strictly off-limits private collection room, the unthinkable happened.  
  
When the delicate crash echoed through the hallway, the guards stationed outside went pale. That was the antique vase Liam had dropped over eight million on at last year's auction.  
  
""I-I'm so s-sorry,"" Riley stammered, kneeling helplessly among the priceless shards, her fingers hovering uncertainly over the broken pieces. ""I just wanted to see the pretty flower thing...""  
  
Liam crouched down and caught her wrist with surprising gentleness. ""Don't touch it, baby. You'll hurt yourself.""  
  
He carefully examined her fingers for cuts, then turned to his stunned men.  
  
""Get every breakable thing out of this house. Now.""  
  
By that afternoon, the entire mansion had been transformed with wall-to-wall plush carpeting, and every piece of sharp-edged furniture had been swapped for childproof rounded corners.  
  
Jade watched from the shadows as Liam's life transformed—coming home promptly for dinner each night, teaching himself to make Riley's favorite soufflés, learning childish nursery rhymes on the guitar to make her smile. One rainy evening, she caught him kneeling at the entryway, meticulously tying perfect bows on Riley's rain boots—all the little things Jade had desperately craved but never received.  
  
She wanted to disappear now, but something held her back—one last chance for the man who had saved her life.  
  
In that crumbling orphanage with peeling wallpaper, fifteen-year-old Jade had stabbed the administrator who tried to assault her. She'd stared at her trembling hands, still warm and sticky with the administrator's blood.  
  
""Your mother dumped you here because you're bad luck,"" his words echoed.  
  
""Destined for a short life, just like your deadbeat father...""  
  
She first met Liam while on the run. ""Did you kill that old pervert?"" he'd asked bluntly. Rain dripped from her eyelashes as she gave a slight nod.  
  
Liam surprised her with a smile, wiping mud from her face with calloused fingertips that scraped against her skin.  
  
""Impressive. You've got natural talent.""  
  
She'd been following him ever since.  
  
On her eighteenth birthday, Jade took a poisoned blade meant for Liam.  
  
Under the harsh operating room lights, she'd counted ceiling cracks while listening to Liam's rage-filled shouting and the sound of furniture being destroyed in the waiting room.  
  
When the anesthesia wore off, Liam's hands hovered shakily above her stitches. She'd never seen him rattled before.  
  
""Does it hurt?"" he'd asked.  
  
Jade shook her head, and Liam laughed—a terrifying sound.  
  
""Liar.""  
  
She only learned after discharge that the would-be assassin had been fed to dogs and left to die slowly under the scorching sun for days. Liam's crew whispered that Mr. Knox usually showed restraint—they'd never seen him so viciously cruel before.  
  
Sometimes Liam would tease her, tilting her chin up, his eyes dancing with amusement. ""Call me 'big brother.'""  
  
Jade would look away, her hair falling to hide her reddening ears.  
  
""Liam.""  
  
""So disrespectful.""  
  
He'd laugh softly, twirling a strand of her hair around his finger.  
  
""All these years raising you for nothing?""  
  
""That airhead messed up the ledgers again. I was up till midnight fixing her garbage.""  
  
Jade snapped back to the present. Several of Liam's crew were gossiping in front of her, their voices growing bolder.  
  
""What does Mr. Knox even see in her?""  
  
""Right? She can't even brew decent coffee.""  
  
""Last week she gave him coffee with eraser bits in it. Said they 'fell in' while she was sharpening pencils.""  
  
Amid the laughter, someone pushed their luck: ""If you ask me, Jade's the only woman worthy of Mr. Knox. What's that little princess good for besides playing innocent?""  
  
Jade hesitated, then let her bottled frustration spill out.  
  
""Her innocent act is pretty convincing.""  
  
""Liam marrying her is like playing house with a child.""  
  
The words had barely left her mouth when heavy footsteps sounded behind her. The entire room went deathly silent.  
  
She looked up to see everyone's faces drain of color, all eyes fixed on something—or someone—behind her.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Jade whipped around to see Liam standing just feet away, his black trench coat damp with night mist—clearly he'd brought Riley home early because of the rain.  
  
Liam's eyes were ice cold—a look she hadn't seen in ages. Meanwhile, Riley was playfully holding his pinky finger, blinking with childlike innocence.  
  
""Liam, what's 'playing house' mean?"" she asked sweetly.  
  
His expression instantly softened as he gently ruffled Riley's hair.  
  
""Go upstairs and wait for me.""  
  
Once she'd skipped away, he stalked toward Jade, each step deliberate.  
  
""Seems I've been too lenient with you lately.""  
  
His voice was quiet, but it sucked all the oxygen from the room.  
  
""Outside. On your knees. You can come back in when you learn to control your mouth.""  
  
Jade's pupils constricted in shock. Outside, lightning split the sky as rain pelted the windows like bullets.  
  
She opened her mouth but couldn't produce a sound. Liam knew better than anyone how terrified she was of violent storms.  
  
On that rainy night when she was fifteen, if Liam hadn't shown up, she would've died in that roadside ditch.  
  
Since then, no matter how busy he was, he always came back during thunderstorms to stay with her.  
  
Once when she was caught in a downpour during a deal in the suburbs, Liam had abruptly ended negotiations with foreign investors and sped back, getting ticketed three times for running red lights.  
  
Now, he was sending her out into the storm.  
  
Jade's heels clicked against the marble floor. When she pushed open the glass door, the humid wind slapped her face with stinging raindrops.  
  
She lifted her dress hem and slowly knelt on the wet flagstone in front of the mansion.  
  
Most of the crew had already scattered. When the first lightning struck, she glimpsed through the floor-to-ceiling windows as Liam bent down to tie Riley's bathrobe sash. The girl said something that made his stern features relax into a smile.  
  
Jade counted the seconds, hoping that like before, he'd soften after a few minutes and bring her inside, wrapping her shivering body in a dry towel.  
  
But three hours passed, and the door remained shut.  
  
Rain trickled down her spine and under her dress, feeling like icy fingers against her skin. She couldn't control her violent shivering.  
  
Just as she nearly blacked out, lights suddenly flicked on upstairs. Through the second-floor window, she saw Liam cradling Riley in his arms, the girl wearing fuzzy pajamas, watching cartoons in his embrace.  
  
Near dawn, the rain finally stopped.  
  
Jade's knees had gone numb, her lips purple with cold. Liam finally opened the door and looked down at her. ""Remember how this feels?""  
  
She raised her head, wet hair plastered to her face. She wanted to say yes, but her throat was too raw to make a sound.  
  
Liam crouched down and gently wiped rainwater from her face.  
  
The tender gesture made Jade's eyes burn with tears—until he spoke:  
  
""Riley has a heart condition. I better not hear anything that could upset her again.""  
  
So that was it. Jade wanted to laugh, but couldn't even find the strength to move her lips.  
  
Riley appeared in the doorway clutching a stuffed animal, eyes still heavy with sleep.  
  
As Jade's gaze drifted upward, she froze when she spotted the unmistakable hickey on Riley's pale neck—painfully visible against her fair skin.  
  
A harsh laugh escaped Jade's throat.  
  
""Seriously, Liam? You really will stoop to anything.""  
  
""You won't even spare the fools.""

I work on a very busy street in South Florida that is absolutely filled with homeless people. First off, this is not a post hating on homeless people. I feel so deeply about how awful this situation is for them but at this point I am exhausted coming to work. We have been actively losing customers due to reviews and comments like: “great coffee shop, awesome workers but there are tons of homeless people with their feet up outside smoking and drinking”. Every day I open I have to kick people off the chairs from sleeping there so I can put out the chair cushions. They leave trash, beer, their actual belongs, food, throw up, and so much more. I am getting paid minimum wage btw. The other day people were literally smoking cra*k outside. I am a women who truly could not win a fight with them (I have been threatened). We have been instructed to contact non emergency to have them removed but they run from them and then we can’t trespass them. Every worker at our shop has been harassed. Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane. We are in the process of having a meeting with the city set up with the city. I am so sick of coming to work and having to deal with this. There are so many things I didn’t mention. This is not only a daily issue but happens multiple times during my single shift, yesterday I called the cops once and non emergency once as well as having to kick out more than 5 people. 

If any business owners have any advice that would be greatly appreciated. 


Edit- I am in college. I also really enjoy this job besides the homelessness issue, everyone is telling me to look for a different place to work. If this does not change, I will 100% be looking to work at a different place. But for now I want to be a part of that change as I really enjoy this business and the community it stands for.

The couch was soft, worn in the way that made it feel like a familiar hug. A leaned back, relaxed but alert, while B disappeared into the kitchen. Moments later, they returned with a tray—bagels, bruschetta, blackberries, brie, banana bread, and a bottle of berry soda.

“I didn’t know what you liked,” B said, placing the tray on the coffee table. “So… I just went full B.”

A laughed. “Best decision ever.”

B sat next to him, just close enough that their knees touched. The warmth between them hummed like a quiet song. B turned their face slightly, and a soft blush crept up their cheeks.

“I’m sorry,” they said quietly, brushing hair behind their ear. “I know I look… bloated, barefaced, a little bed-headed, and—ugh—my outfit is basically boring.”

A turned to her, brow lifted with amused disbelief. “You’re kidding, right?”

She looked down. A gently reached for her hand.

“You’re breathtaking,” he said. “Bright-eyed, bold, balanced in a way most people never are. You have this blooming beauty—like something’s always waking up in you. And honestly, you’ve got this badass, brilliant, blazing energy that I can’t stop watching.”

**Food Industry Roundup: Market Fluctuations, Nutritional Insights, and Culinary Experiences (May 28, 2025)**

The food industry witnessed a dynamic day of activity on May 28, 2025, with a range of developments impacting both financial markets and consumer lifestyles. From fluctuating stock prices of major food companies to evolving dietary trends and exciting culinary events, the day offered a glimpse into the ever-changing landscape of the food sector.

**Market Performance and Investment Insights**

The stock market presented a mixed bag of performance for key players in the food processing and related sectors. Britannia Industries, a prominent name in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, experienced intraday fluctuations. While the share price hovered around ₹5487 (with a high of ₹5508 and a low of ₹5410), the stock showed a slight dip of -0.2% to -0.23% in a single day, dependent on which update was viewed. However, the performance improved over the longer term, with a 1.03% to 1.07% gain over the past month and a substantial 19.17% to 19.21% rise over the last three months. Technical analysis placed the daily pivot level at ₹5466.7.

Nestle India, another major player in the Food Processing & Packaging sector, saw its share price at ₹2420.4. The stock traded with a low of ₹2415.55 and a high of ₹2460. Nestle India posted a decrease of -1.69% in one day, but demonstrated moderate growth of 0.69% over the past month and a notable 10.54% over the last three months. The daily pivot level for Nestle India was set at 2439.37.

Tata Consumer Products, operating in the Tea & Coffee sector, experienced a more pronounced decline. With a share price of ₹1124.3, the stock saw a low of ₹1120.1 and a high of ₹1139.45. Tata Consumer Products recorded a -1.21% loss in a single day and a -2.85% loss over the month. However, the company exhibited positive performance in the last three months, achieving a 16.65% increase. The daily pivot level was set at 1130.72.

These fluctuating stock performances highlight the inherent volatility in the market, influenced by factors such as consumer trends, market dynamics, and economic conditions. Investors are encouraged to analyze these trends in conjunction with market reports.

**Nutritional Trends and Dietary Insights**

In the realm of health and wellness, the focus remained on informed dietary choices. One article provided valuable insights into protein consumption. Instead of simply focusing on massive muscle gains, the article emphasized the multifaceted benefits of protein for overall well-being. It highlighted that protein plays a critical role in supporting fullness, maintaining steady energy levels, regulating blood sugar and mood, and contributing to hormone production, skin health, and immune function. The article debunked the myth of requiring excessive amounts of supplements to achieve sufficient protein intake, instead advocating for a balanced approach that includes incorporating protein-rich foods into everyday meals.

A popular Instagram video by a Korean woman showcased her 62-year-old father's diet as a key factor in his youthful appearance. His daily routine included black coffee, banana-topped cabbage salads, soy milk matcha lattes, and a diet low in dairy, sugar, and red meat. This underscored the growing interest in the connection between dietary choices and longevity, as well as the impact of specific food habits on physical appearance.

**Culinary Experiences and Entertainment**

The culinary landscape was also enriched by an exciting announcement. The Guardian's Feast app, a digital cookbook, promises to simplify cooking with its extensive recipe database and convenient features. This app offers recipes from the world's best cooks and simplifies the process with options like cook mode, ingredient-based searches, and a 'save for later' feature. This underscores the evolution of food media and how technology can be used to make cooking more accessible and enjoyable.

Heineken 0.0 is hosting an event at the JW Marriot in Juhu for the 2024/25 Champions League final. The event promises to provide an immersive experience for football fans, with the ultimate viewing experience.

**Other notable news**

Casper Ruud, a professional tennis player, shared his thoughts about managing expenses. Ruud highlighted the financial considerations behind hiring a private chef while traveling during tournaments. He's currently competing at the French Open.

**Conclusion**

The food industry displayed a combination of market volatility, changing dietary patterns, and exciting culinary offerings on May 28, 2025. Investors must continue to analyze the financial markets of food stocks with thorough analysis, and the evolution of consumer habits continue to influence the market. In addition, the focus on health, wellness, and culinary experiences shows a shift toward informed eating and enhanced entertainment.

At a quiet corner cafe, the kind where the air smells like roasted beans and rainy sidewalks, A spotted an empty seat next to B. Without asking, he sat—an audacious, amber-eyed, athletic man with an arched brow and an air of adventure. His presence felt like movement, even when still.

B, flipping through a textbook, glanced up only briefly. They’d never seen A before. But they studied him now—his angular jaw, alert stance, the aura of someone used to winning. B tilted their head and said, half amused, “You look like you just jogged in from an ad campaign for abs.”

A chuckled, leaning in slightly. “And you,” he said with a grin, “look brilliant, bold, and just a bit bewitching. A beautiful mystery holding a book.”

There was a pause, thick with the hum of espresso machines and quiet courage. A smiled again. “Can I buy you a coffee?”

About Me:
I'm someone who enjoys the quieter side of life books, coffee, rain, and a good view (mountains are a plus). I’m an introvert who values emotional connection and honesty in relationships. I tend to lead with my heart more than logic, which sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t but I like being that way.

Travel makes me happy, I enjoy meaningful conversations, and I believe being emotionally present is important in any relationship. I’m hopeful about building something strong and genuine with the right person.

Family:
I come from a big sweet family five siblings and parents. Two of my sisters are married. We're all pretty grounded and supportive.

What I’m Looking For:
Someone kind, emotionally available, and respectful. Someone who gets the importance of family, values sincerity, and isn’t afraid of being soft when it matters. Bonus if you have a sense of humor and wouldn’t mind being my travel partner.

ITS LITERALLY A FUCKING SYNTHESISER 

Buy one, USE IT, learn how it works BY USING IT.
It’s not a fucking control panel for an aeroplane, it’s a stupid box that makes a noise.

Every subtractive synth basically does the same thing if you try hard enough, you can make good music with a fucking upturned dustbin and a stick if you want to.

I love synths, they’re tactile, versatile, and an amazing tool for exploring your musicality, but they will not give you musicality on a silver platter. That comes by exploring yourself, what you really want to make and what you want communicate to yourself or the world through what you do. this is internal work and it is a slow gruelling process.

A lot of the synth blabber is a microcosm of an issue that exists everywhere in the art world, people are scared of failure and so use ‘reliable tools’ to try and work backwards towards ‘creative goodness’. Beethoven spent half an hour making his coffee using exactly 60 beans per cup before writing his music, is this what I’ve been missing this whole time?

When you are scared about whether or not ‘you have it’ it is very easy to try and attach yourself to some object or process you feel will lead to you reliably creating ‘great art’. The problem with this is it intentionally removes yourself from the creative process, often leading to art that is insincere and predictable.

Obviously for a lot of people, synths are just a hobby, and making jams and fucking about is genuinely just a lot of fun. I don’t want to paint everyone with the same brush, but I feel like a lot of the constant gear hoarding, obsession over minute specifications and long winding modular jam sessions, are often a distraction from doing the scary internal work needed to create something meaningful to yourself.

Maybe this has been said on this sub a million times, and seems fairly obvious,  but the obscene amounts of money people spend on this shit is just crazy to me and I needed to get this off my chest

Today, I'll point out two disadvantages to LEAPS.

**PMCC Strikes Pinned to Your Long Strike**

I recently disposed of my AMZN LEAPS. I purchased them on December 26, 2024 when AMZN opened at $228.50. I purchased a $200 strike, December 2025 expiration for \~$50. With the market turbulence we experienced in the Spring, AMZN dropped below $200 on March 7, 2025 and had struggled to regain the $200 level. It's currently at $205.47.

To take an example for my point, on April 3, 2025, AMZN closed at $171. If I wanted to sell a call at, for example, $190 (that is, below my long strike of $200), I would have needed to come up with cash collateral to cover the value between my long strike and short strike. I saw this as an inefficient use of my capital, so just kept selling $200 calls for peanuts.

This is one reason why it is advised that, when buying LEAPS, buy them deep in-the-money. Even then, if I had selected a $180 strike instead of $200, I would have been faced with the dilemma at various points.

**Risk of Trading Violation if Short Call is Exercised in a Tax-Deferred Account**

In a tax deferred account such as a traditional IRA or Roth IRA, there is no ability to have a full margin account, the best you can do is have limited margin.

What this means is that if your short call is exercised with no actual stock to get called away, you will have a short position in your account after the exercise. Now, you can likely resolve it ""same day"", but that doesn't matter...you went short, and that would be a trading violation. 

You truly don't want to accumulate trading violations in your tax deferred account as you could jeopardize all sorts of things. In a tax deferred account, therefore, it's imperative you act proactively to avoid assignment.

**Conclusion**

Like all things option-related, LEAPS can provide certain opportunities, but they also present some unique risks, especially in a tax deferred account. Keep your eyes wide open and actively manage your positions if they become ""troubled""!",2,1748444606.0,StockOptionCoffeeShop,0,1.0,False

The porch groans beneath my weight, wood warped from age and too many wet winters. I hate this house. I used to spend summers here, dropped off and forgotten by my parents. Back then, I’d wander from sunrise until Grandma called me back. Now, it just feels hollow.

I reach for the old brass knob, but before I can turn it—

“Hey, Luke.”

The voice freezes me.

I turn to see Jaden. One of the only friends I had here—and one I promised myself I’d never see again.

“Hey, Jaden.” I shake his hand, stiffly. This is awkward as hell.

I’m here because Grandma died and left me this house. This hole. And now I’m staring at a face I’d buried with the rest of this town.

“Crazy seeing you here,” he says, rubbing the back of his neck.

Seeing me? It’s my damn house.

“She left it to me,” I say flatly. “Trying to decide if I’m going to sell.”

His expression shifts—like I kicked a dog.

“Oh… sell. Huh. Thought maybe you’d move back,” he says, awkward again. “Especially after all the fun times we had—remember?”

Fun times. Right. More like weird, terrifying nights we never talked about again.

My hand is sweaty. I swipe it down my jeans, heart pounding. Why?

I clear my throat. “Yeah, well—I need to…”

To what? Hide from your past? That’s the only reason you’re here, idiot. Is to hide.

“Yeah, no problem,” Jaden says quickly, backing off. “Just saw the lights and wanted to check in.”

Lights? I haven’t been here more than five minutes. Haven’t turned anything on.

He waves over his shoulder as he walks off. He’s weirder now than he was at seventeen.

I turn back to the door—and freeze.

It’s open. Just slightly.

Did I open it? No. I didn’t. Then—?

No. Stop it. It’s an old house. Probably just shifted when I stepped on the porch.

I push inside. It’s freezing. Dead-of-winter cold. In the middle of summer.

Then, I hear my grandmother’s voice drift from the kitchen.

“Luke, dinnertime!”

I look down at my hands—they’re filthy. Mud. And something else.

I hurry to the bathroom to wash up.

I flick the switch. The closet-sized bathroom floods with soft yellow light. I turn on the tap and blink.

My hands are clean.

What the hell?

Jaden’s visit has me rattled. I turn off the light and head for the living room. It’s practically bare: a couch, coffee table, bookshelf, and Grandma’s knitting corner.

Nothing’s changed in twenty years.

I pull out my phone and order a pizza. Sinking into the couch with a mystery novel, I try to breathe in the quiet—peace.

Then a floorboard creaks overhead.

I freeze.

Grandma’s been dead three months. No one should be upstairs.

Last episode was About 3-4 months ago we were going out and we needed someone to stay with the kids (14m, 12f, 2m) and I suggested we should leave them with my mom, that way she gets to hangout with them, since she doesn’t really spend much time with them. My wife tried to counter that and try to make it so that they would stay with her parents, but I stood my ground and they were gonna stay with my mom. The day came and I drop them off early at my moms house, so we could get ready, and as we are almost leaving she tells me she doesn’t feel ok living the youngest one with my mom because she won’t know how to take care of him, and I said that it wouldn’t be a big deal, anyways she calls my mom to talk to her about this and basically ends up saying she’s going to pick them up and basically hangs up on her abruptly, I got pretty much pissed at that, but decided to play it cool cuz I didn’t want to mess up the day, we picked up the kids and my mother definitely felt disrespected by her for hanging up the phone in such a manner (but because I walked in and got the kids we didn’t really get to discuss it.

After that they weren’t speaking much to the point where my mom ended up blocking her on WhatsApp, and my wife found out that she was blocked, and then also found out that my daughter was blocked (my daughter being blocked is kinda not clear on how that happened). And basically I had to hear it again about how my mother was a nightmare and how she hated us and just a bunch of demeaning things about my mother, and I tried to stay neutral and said that it was a reaction based on what had happened ( I didn’t know a 100% but I kinda figured) and that we should all have a conversation about it and get down to the bottom of the issue between her and my mother, because I didn’t want to feel like my mother wouldn’t be accept in my house if she wanted to come over or whatever.

Fast forward to Memorial Day weekend, one of my aunts was in town and since I had just bought my house a couple of months ago I wanted her to come see it, and she was staying at my moms house, so I ended up inviting my mother over also, my wife knew about it because I communicated to her that I wanted to bring them over, and she was fine with it. My mother on the other hand was a bit skeptical about coming over but at the end decided to come.

My wife was cool with it and even went and bought some crackers and cheese to serve and some coffee. We get there and walk in and everything seemed to be cordial, but I could tell my wife was not too comfortable with this visit not from my aunt but from my mother, she seem hesitant and didn’t want to sit with us and was a little tense, some time goes by I’m showing my aunt the house and we go back to the living room and my wife is kinda just floating around and not really sitting or interacting, just kinda awkward, by then I had noticed my daughter had not said hi to my mom or aunt so I go to her room and asked her to come and say hi to them, she basically refused and then my wife came over and in front of everyone basically asked me what was wrong and that she felt like the mood was tense, that if there was something going on I should tell her, kinda in a way so others can hear, and I basically said that no one was saying anything and that if she had a problem she could just say it, and she said that maybe my mother had a problem and so then I asked my mother in front of everyone if she had a problem and my mother replied that she didn’t and that moment was settled.

Well after a little while my wife was sitting next to me and my mother was sitting across, and so there was silence and I felt like I had to try and get them talking about the issue without picking sides just talk it out to start from scratch, and when I did that, and I started pointing out some of the things that they have both done to make the issue bigger then all hell broke loose and they started arguing with each other, it got pretty intense, my mother mentioned her hanging up the phone and my wife mentioned something to the effect of her being deceiving, and basically it was a mess, nothing came of it, they disrespected each other some more, I tried to mediate but it didn’t work, by the end I took my mother home, and it hurt me to see the 2 of the most important women in my life not get along with each other, so now I’m just here thinking of if I should even stay with my wife (not running to my mothers arms because I know she has as much fault and I’m a grown man) or walk away just cuz I can’t stand the idea of not being able to have my kids see their grandmother or have her over when we have get togethers, maybe I’m just thinking about it too much, maybe I should just look forward to a live where my mother has very limited access to my kids.

Tl;dr: my wife and mother got into a heated argument over Memorial Day weekend over the way they treat each other, I tried to meditate but it didn’t work, im contemplating braking it off with my wife because I feel she is being way too condescending against my mother, but I also know my mother has some fault in this too, and now I’m contemplating weather if I should move out altogether and start from scratch.

What Are Linkable Assets (and Why Should You Care)?

Think of linkable assets as your website’s magnet for attention.

These are pieces of content that naturally attract backlinks because they genuinely help people in your industry or community.

And guess what? You don’t need a huge team or budget to create them. You just need to be smart, helpful, and a bit creative.

Examples of Linkable Assets For Small Businesses:

How-To Guides or Tutorials

“The Ultimate Guide to Setting Up Google My Business (2025 Edition)”

Why Linkable Assets Matter (Especially for Small Businesses):

They Earn Backlinks Naturally

No begging or buying. Just real, useful content people want to link to.

They Show You Know Your Stuff

Sharing tips, data, or tools positions your business as a trusted authority.

They Get Shared Whether it’s a helpful infographic or a how-to guide, people love passing around valuable info.

They Help You Rank Google loves valuable content. The more links you get, the better your chances of hitting page 1.

They Solve Real Problems When you create content that answers actual customer questions, people notice—and share it.

Real-World Example: Say you run a local landscaping business. You publish a free “Seasonal Lawn Care Checklist for Las Vegas Homeowners.” Other blogs or even local news outlets writing about home care might link to it.

That’s SEO working for you—no outreach needed.

TL;DR: Linkable assets = a small business’s secret weapon to get noticed, build trust, and grow—organically.

And no, content-based SEO isn’t dead. Can a machine really replicate your lived experience running a bakery, managing clients, or solving real-world problems? Nope.",1,1748443918.0,u_mrvelvet-glhf,0,1.0,False

Nothing fancy—just functional. Or at least enough for my wife's iced coffee drinks.

Recently, I decided it was time to step things up. I picked up a bottomless portafilter, a Kingrinder K6, and some freshly roasted beans from a local roaster.

Today was my first run with the new setup, and surprisingly, I think I pulled a decent shot on the first try!

I used 18g of a medium-dark roast, ground at 40 clicks on the K6. The shot looked good coming out of the portafilter—no channeling, and the stream looked solid. It finished around the 27-second mark from the moment I turned the machine on, and visually, it looked nice in the cup. Taste-wise? Honestly pretty darn good (though I’m still developing my palate).

But here’s where I’m confused: I always thought a double shot meant 2oz of liquid espresso, but I’ve now learned that’s measured without the crema—just the black coffee part?

It didn’t seem like my shot was running particularly slow, yet the liquid yield was well under 2oz. I’ve watched a ton of espresso videos, and I’m struggling to believe my shot was flowing at half the rate of a typical 25–30 second double from the pros.

Overall, I’m pretty happy with how it turned out for a first go, but I’m a bit puzzled by this yield issue. Any advice on how to troubleshoot?

I get my 5 year old son for half the week, and while we have a blast when we're together, he's non verbal and damn do I miss adult conversation. I have zero friends here.

Now, I've noticed this woman who lives in my apartment complex- not in a sexual way, but she definitely sets off my ND spidey sense by the way she dresses, carries herself, and the things she talks about in our group chat on WhatsApp (she's into healing crystals, auras, chakras and all that). Id be extenely surpirsed if she wasn't some flavor of ND. By her appearance, I'd say she's probably mid 30s/early 40s like me.

That being said, I just really want to try and make a friend. If not someone to grab a coffee and sit and chat with, at least someone to text and talk about life on occasion.

Any suggestions? I see her out walking her dog around the complex every now and again, but it would feel weird to randomly go downstairs without a purpose other than to stop and talk with her.

The Empire has been built with a long period of time and money with a clear mission.  I see QNX being the dominant player in its field for the long time ahead.

“The explosion of the Chinese market has shown QNX engineers the meaning of “Shenzhen speed.” In 2023, the coffee machine in their Shanghai office was still working at 2 a.m., serving car manufacturers queuing up to debug their systems.

In the final 72 hours before the launch of the Changan Deep Blue SL03, the QNX team helped the automaker fix 17 system vulnerabilities overnight. Such last-minute sprints have become routine, as the development cycle for domestic vehicles has been compressed to just 18 months.

“For every 10 yuan we make, 3 go straight into the lab,” said QNX President Mattias, pointing at the simulation equipment in their Pudong R&D center.

There, 240 test machines simultaneously simulate extreme conditions like torrential rain and severe cold, generating 500 gigabytes of data every minute. An executive from Great Wall Motors once personally witnessed their in-vehicle system operating smoothly at minus 40 degrees Celsius.

Behind the price war, the technical arms race is even more brutal. One EV startup switched to open-source systems to cut costs, only to face night-time black screen failures after the cars were delivered.

“Using QNX adds 80 yuan per car, but recalling a vehicle costs 4,000 yuan,” supply chain manager Mr. Zhou said with a wry smile. Now they install QNX systems in all export models, and EU safety certification is passed on the first try.

The epicenter of geopolitical storms is shifting. At the 2024 North American Auto Show, American carmakers were marveling at Chinese-made smart cockpits—all prominently bearing the QNX certification label.

“Canadian systems have become a shield,” revealed Mr. Li, a trade exporter. Middle Eastern clients now specifically request QNX-equipped models, saying they offer better protection against hacking.

On the display wall of BlackBerry’s Beijing office, the logos of 255 million vehicles form a world map.

Every day, 2,000 engineers in 30 countries maintain this invisible empire. Their latest achievement? Reducing the startup time of in-vehicle systems to 0.8 seconds—0.3 seconds faster than it takes an average person to fasten a seatbelt.”

\^ \* \^ \* \^

Waking brought far more trouble than it was worth. 



Bryce’s tongue was plastered to the roof of her mouth, her hair slicked to her face with sweat. She blinked through the darkness with crusty lashes, seeing a crack of afternoon light pour out from her thick curtains. She groaned, her head aching in a piercing, nauseating sort of way.



She sat up slowly, eyes adjusting to the low light. She reached for her glass of water but came up empty, cursing herself for not preparing better. She placed her head in her hands, breathing slowly and searching for the will to live.



She had the vague memory of bursting with joy last night, but it felt so far away. Now, she just felt empty. And nauseous.



A soft snore startled her, and she turned to see black, leathery wings sprawled out across her bed. She blinked a few times, like he was a mirage that would disappear when the light shifted, but he remained. Pieces of the night swirled in her brain like an old dream, and she sighed with a familiar shake of her head.



Bryce stared at Azriel’s beautiful face, finally relaxed in his sleep. His mouth was slightly open, and a small wet spot on the pillow told her he was drooling. She giggled at the sight, so at odds with his usual demeanor, and his wings twitched towards her. Not wanting to wake him at least until she took care of her demon breath, she scooted off the bed as silently as possible, grabbed her toothbrush, and headed for the kitchen. She drank as much water as she could fit inside her, then brushed her teeth over the pile of dishes in the sink, eyes roaming over the absolute mess they had left behind.



Her gaze settled on a large pile of mirthroot on the dining room table, and Bryce smirked, toothbrush still hanging from her mouth. She messily rinsed her mouth, grabbed a clean glass to throw her toothbrush in, started the coffee pot, and quickly gathered supplies to bring out on her balcony.



She was staring forlornly over the city and contemplating the enduring pain of being alive, hair swept up in a messy bun with mirthroot burning in her hand, when the sliding doors pushed open. 



Azriel appeared, still in nothing but his underwear. He was holding two steaming mugs.



“I could kiss you right now,” Bryce exclaimed as she eagerly jumped to her feet and grabbed a cup from him. He looked down as he sipped from his own, and Bryce went to do the same when a bitter scent hit her nose.



“*Black* coffee?” she spat out, horrified.



“Is there another color?” he asked in confusion, and Bryce snorted with laughter.



“Come with me,” she ordered as she strode back into the kitchen. She rummaged through her fridge and found her favorite cream, pouring a generous amount in both of their cups and stirring. 



Azriel took a sip and wrinkled his nose. “It’s sweet,” he complained.



“Yeah, that’s the point,” Bryce quipped, rolling her eyes and returning to her balcony. 



He trailed behind her, settling in a chair across from her and staring out over the city. He looked mildly surprised when she handed him the mirthroot, but he shrugged and put it to his lips without complaint.



They sat in silence for a while, Azriel watching the city in fascination as Bryce reclined lazily on the loveseat.



Bryce felt the growing urge to speak, but her thoughts were still muddy and she didn’t know where to start. 



“I thought you’d be angry with me,” she finally said into the air.



“For which reckless decision of yours, exactly?” he asked, jaw clenching.



“For everything that happened in Prythian.” She struggled to maintain his gaze.



“I am.” 



She waited for him to crack a smile, but his icy expression stayed firmly in place.



“You are?” she asked, not sure why she felt so surprised.



“I’ve been angry with you for a year,” he said roughly. 



“So last night…” she trailed off, not sure how to finish her question.



“I think we both needed a break last night.”



“And now?”



“We can take some time to recover before we fight about it,” Azriel smirked. 



Bryce chewed on her lip while she tried to think. Gods, she forgot how awful the morning after always felt. She felt on the verge of a breakdown and completely numb all at the same time.



“I’m a terrible person,” she whined pathetically, covering her face with a pillow.



“I’m afraid our fight won’t be much fun if you’re already on my side,” he said amusedly.



“What am I going to tell him?” She slid the pillow over just enough to peek up at him. They both knew what she meant.



“Why tell him anything?”



“Don’t I have to?” Bryce asked, feeling slightly hopeful at the thought of burying this deep within herself. 



“You were highly intoxicated,” he said with a shrug.



“Is that a good excuse?”



“Do you need one? You said he left you.” Azriel’s face was dark, and he turned his gaze to back to the bustling street below. 



“He did, but…” Bryce trailed off, no good argument coming to mind. 



Azriel was right. Should she have been less slutty last night? Probably. Did she cheat on Hunt? Absolutely fucking not. 



Not after the way they left things.



“Your secret’s safe with me,” Azriel said lightheartedly, standing and stretching his wings. 



Bryce weighed her options, knowing she would have to tell Hunt eventually. Maybe eventually didn’t have to be today. Or tomorrow. 



“That witch, on the other hand,"" he added, ""she’s a wild card. We might need to track her down and pay her off.” 



Bryce giggled at the joke, and then thrust the pillow back over her face dramatically. “Fuck, I forgot about the witch. I am a literal piece of trash,” she groaned loudly. 



After a long minute, Azriel pulled the pillow gently from her hands, peering down at her with an eyebrow raised.



“Wasn’t she so hot, though?” Bryce asked, the smile returning to her face as she remembered. Azriel grinned back and grabbed her empty coffee cup. 



He strode for the doorway before pausing. “I hadn’t noticed.”



“Yeah, okay,” Bryce rolled her eyes.



“My eyes were preoccupied elsewhere.” 



He left the balcony at that, and Bryce flushed bright red as she heard coffee pouring in the distance. He surprised her by opening the fridge, and the familiar clank of a spoon echoed as he stirred in the cream. 



“Extra cream!” she yelled out, and his soft chuckle barely reached her ears.



She exhaled deeply, trying to wrap her head around too many things at once. 



“Fuck me,” she muttered, closing her eyes and wishing for the shadows to whisk her  far, far away.



\*\*\*\*



After a few hours of quietly lounging, during which Bryce insisted she was *not* dozing off, she got up to shower with great protest from her muscles. Grateful to scrub off the night before and with nothing left to give, she took her time getting ready. She came back dressed in a black tank top tucked into high waisted jeans, hair pulled up in a messy ponytail with gold jewelry dangling from her ears, wrists, and throat. She held a pile of fresh clothes for Azriel, who was sitting on the couch with Syrinx lying across his lap. The kitchen was now spotless.



“You didn’t have to do that,” she said, feeling slightly embarrassed despite knowing he'd helped her make the mess. “I brought these for you — I figured you’re not as fond of showing skin as I am.” She flashed him a smile before she gestured to the bathroom. “I left fresh towels out for you in the bathroom if you want to shower.”



“Shower?” he asked in confusion, looking like a child still learning how the world works. 



“I’ll show you,” she said with a half-hearted smile, leading him down to the bathroom and teaching him what all the knobs did before leaving him to it.



Several minutes later, Azriel approached wearing fitted gray jeans and a long-sleeved black t-shirt. His sleeves were too short and his tattoos peeked out, siphons nowhere to be found. 



Bryce opened her mouth dramatically. If it weren't for the massive wings spread behind him, he would have looked like he belonged on Declan’s couch or playing sunball with Ithan.



“You look so… normal. It’s weirding me out.”



“I don’t feel normal,” he grunted.



“How was your first shower?” she asked with a grin. 



“Incredible. What kind of magic is that?” he asked earnestly.



“You can thank the mortals for that one,” Bryce laughed. “Don’t get all spoiled by our modern luxuries, now. That’s my job.” 



She approached him and pushed his sleeves up to his elbow, hiding the poor length and exposing more of his intricate tattoos. Her heart skipped a beat, her starlight pulsing as her ears popped and dizziness overcame her. She swayed slightly, shadows wrapping around her waist to steady her. Azriel watched her carefully, and she cleared her throat as she stepped away shaking her head. 



*This is why we stay home on the couch at night,* she thought to herself bitterly, mourning a time when she didn’t feel like complete garbage.



A knock boomed at the front door, and Bryce jumped at the noise. Azriel’s shadows snapped to attention, his stony mask already in place.



Bryce groaned. She barely had enough energy to handle this *situation* she’d gotten herself into last night. She couldn’t handle more company.

  
The knock sounded again, harsher this time. Bryce swore under her breath and stormed towards the door.



She undid the locks and flung it open, already glaring at the poor soul on the other side.



Her stomach dropped as white wings filled the doorway. 



“Bryce,” he said softly before his eyes moved behind her and narrowed, lightning flashing and sizzling over his skin as the air popped.



Hunt Athalar was at Bryce’s door, staring murderously over her shoulder at Azriel.





\^ \* \^ \* \^


  


“I officially hate today already,” Bryce whined loudly, putting her face in her hands.



“What the fuck?” Hunt asked loudly, moving to get past Bryce. She glared at him through her fingers, starlight flaring as she stood her ground. 



“Hunt, it’s not- ” he pushed past her roughly, storming into the living room. Bryce turned to see Azriel flex his hands, Hunt’s eyes wild with rage. 



“Did you fuck him?” he spat at her.



Bryce cringed. “No, you alphahole.”



She knew she didn’t exactly have the right to feel indignant after the night she’d had, but she was too drained to care and too annoyed to be dealing with this right now.



“Where the Hel were you last night? You never answered your phone.”



“I was at the White Raven. My phone was still behind my bed after I threw it at you yesterday.” Bryce closed her eyes and rubbed her already pounding temples.



“I thought you were *dead,*” he gritted out.



“Unfortunately still breathing over here, but thanks for the concern.”



“So you brought some random guy home?” He was fuming, looking frantically between Bryce and Azriel. 



She took a deep breath, trying to muster the strength for this and failing miserably. “He’s not just some random  — he’s from —  look, it’s complicated, and my head is killing me, and I don’t think I can handle this conversation right now. Can we please talk about this later?” 



“Are you fucking serious?” he asked, lightning crackling. 



Azriel took a half step forward. Bryce glared at him, and he had the nerve to look somewhat amused.



“Please, Hunt. I promise we can talk more later. Maybe tomorrow?”

  
“Are you *hungover?*” He looked disgusted, like Bryce was a stranger.



“Yes,” she said flatly, unable to handle evading the truth anymore than she already had. She closed her eyes again, unable to handle the look on his face, either. 



“Unbelievable.” He stormed out and slammed the door behind him, shaking the frame and leaving a deafening silence in his wake.



“Alphahole,” Bryce muttered again. She was too ashamed to look at Azriel, so she grabbed her phone and finally checked her missed calls for the first time since she went out last night.



32. 



*Fucking Urd,* she thought to herself as she tossed her phone across the room and stomped away. 



She wished they would all just go to Hel and leave her the fuck alone already.

Since Christmas my feelings have been hurt every now and then.
I'm a person who appreciates little details but perceives every little change on connection, how he talks to me, manners, etc. He didn't have anything for me on Christmas and lied saying my present was coming but never arrived any package. On February 14th we had dinner together, fine. I waited until my birthday and he gave me a little sanrio plush that it wasn't my fav character, which is so obvious if you pay 5% of attention.
His excuse is that he has no money, but I have never saw him without his tobacco or maria since I know him. I saw him expending money on videogames and then he tells me he doesn't want to go on a walk because ""he has no money for a coffee""...
He's being rejecting me for months and only having relations like on Christmas or my birthday. Saying I'm not the problem, that he doesn't feel well and has no desire... That makes me feel so bad and insecure with myself.
Says he loves me but hardly talks to me via WhatsApp or see each other on weekends even he does anything at all during the week.
I see him depressed but he doesn't want to talk to me about it and rejects going to therapy.
His words doesn't resemble with his actions and viceversa.
I feel so lost, angry and sad because after talking about it several times he doesn't change. He doesn't take care of me as I do. ",1,1748443442.0,u_Accomplished-Way3942,0,0.99,False

But then on my second day(yesterday), I just called in altogether. I have been employee of the month for two months straight I'm literally everyone go to person and I am the most senior non management team member there currently. I am known for being extremely well mannered and even receive regular phone calls to the store just for people to compliment me. I almost got myself fucking fired. I kicked a wet floor sign across the store and screamed ""I'm fucking done"" in front of a fuckload of customers then proceeded to tell the customers how shit my job was (I also had a fever that day from an unrelated cold I just caught prior to quitting) I have been hitting my JUUL but trying to limit myself . I'm worried without it though or any nicotine I will get fired. I am noticeably doing worse at everything In life. I know day three is supposed to be the hardest day but I also am disabled and have a ton of health problems but have to work full time to afford the cheapest apartment in my city. So the whole ""diet and exercise"" thing everyone says doesn't really work for me. I as is suffer from chronic low blood sugar and quitting has made it feel so much worse so constantly but I also have eating disorders and used cigarettes as a way of helping me eat and now I just never have an appetite even if I feel deathly sick from hunger ,like I currently do. I have no motivation to eat or do anything. But it's medically necessary I quit I'm at particularly high risk for stroke and heart attack. I am 26 and have been smoking since I was 15. I do smoke weed but I started it before cigarettes and I use it medically so it can't be used to substitute but I'm autistic and havr a fuckload of other mental issues and suffer regular bouts of psychosis when under extreme stress. Something I've fought years to control while at work and is typically no longer a problem . The only time it ever was ,was when I was late to smoking .... I am in a bad mood and almost cussed out my big boss yesterday for giving me attitude for calling in (I still have a cold btw) I have no idea what the fuck im doing with myself and while I logically know I do not want the long-term health problems of nicotine on top of the ones I have already formed from smoking , it does not help me feel any less like I hate myself . I have a lot of body image and mental issues as is and feel trapped being a human being. I feel like Im forced to exist in my body to begin with so bending my wants and needs to the will of a body I can't wait to be separated from becomes complicated. I know I probably need a therapist for some of this shit but again ,disabled ,no car, no family ,40+hr work weeks . I have no time or money for that shit. I feel like I'm not allowed to quit smoking or that my life will never be good enough for me to feel satisfied without it even after decades  I have several regulars at work who mentioned to me that they haven't smoked for 10+ years and yet they still think about it every day and will never be happy and have just ""accepted it for what it is"" because of health issues. I have been homeless and a prostitute most of my life because my situational upbringing fucked me over a lot , I have compromised so much in life and Im really struggling not to commit suicide or hurt myself because I have to quit smoking . But this is the first time I've ever made it to three days . If I ever tried I never committed , I've never since I was 15 gone more than 24 hrs without nicotine. And again I'm also just generally mentally ill and physically ill. I feel like I'm losing track of reality genuinely and I keep accidentally almost fatally or severely injuring myself because I'm forgetting this is real life and am losing complete control over my muscles and what they do. What the hell is wrong with me? Am I broken? Am I a dud? Should I just have to live miserable one way or the other? It's either I die young from a stroke or end up with a hole in my neck anyway and commit suicide. Or I have to accept living a life I will never be satisfied in and will constantly feel suicidal regardless?? I genuinely feel so trapped ?? I also again feel trapped in my body for a million unrelated issues as well so I just feel like it's the straw to break the camels back so to speak but I don't know that it's a reparable camel. I mean as is I am typing this with such progressive intensity and rage that my hands hitting the touch screen sounds like a fucking tap dance routine that just keeps getting faster and angrier. I like to drink tea and coffee and it's helping some but I also heavily associated it with cigarettes so it's also making me depressed. I'm supposed to be working on my portfolio for my tattoo apprenticeship but it is awful timing to quit . But again, I've never made it this far. I know if I try and excuse it or look for a better time it's just gonna mean I'm gonna smoke again for years , there is no ""perfect time"" to quit logically but I'm also worried that I might have ruined my entire life by choosing to quit when I did. I was doing so well with my job and my career and my social things and in just a few days I have almost destroyed my relationship with all of my coworkers and almost ended up with my boyfriend leaving me ( he is also quitting currently lol) I am too stupid and inconsiderate and inconsistent like this and yet I know I cant relapse (plus I work at the nearest place with smokes, so it's like, incredibly difficult without a vehicle to purchase them without judgment anyway cuz they know I quit lol) but also I have to sell cigarettes to people all day and it's really not helping me lol. Plus I had a fucked up life so I'm just about to get a car for the first time in my life and the thought of not being able to smoke in it has also caused me a lot of depression? It was my favorite thing about being in vehicles and the #1 thing I looked forward to having a vehicle for. Now having a car is not something I'm excited about it's just another thing I have to get to survive and another responsibility and another bill to pay. I really have to quit smoking but have no idea how the fuck to adjust my outcome on life. I know it ""gets better over time"" but what the fuck am I supposed to do in the mean time ??? I can't sleep ,I can't eat , I can't even fucking masturbate , I literally can't do anything but suffer and think about hurting myself .

They try to impress. They spend too much, try too hard, and turn it into an interview. Wrong. The first date is not about winning her over. It's about qualifying her. Does she deserve more of your valuable time and attention? Does she align with your frame?

**The Speer Method First Date Blueprint:**

**Low Investment, High Conversation**: Coffee. A single drink at a quiet bar. A walk in a park. This isn't a grand gesture; it's a mutual vetting session. No dinner. No long, elaborate plans. Keep it simple, public, and easy to exit.

**Your Lead, Her Choice (within reason)**: ""I'm grabbing a coffee at \[Specific Place\] on \[Day\] at \[Time\]. Join me?"" Specificity shows leadership. The ""join me?"" offers choice, but you're setting the terms.

**The Time Hack:** Set a soft time limit. ""I've got about an hour before I need to head to \[next commitment\]."" This creates scarcity, signals you have a life, and provides an easy out if there's no connection. It prevents awkward drawn-out interactions with no spark.

**Your Mission**: Qualify. Listen more than you talk. Do her values align? Is she interesting? Does she bring energy? Does she respect your time? Is she genuinely curious about you, or just talking about herself? Don't seek approval; seek alignment.

If it works, escalate. If not, cut it. If there's a spark, make a clear plan for the second date in person. If there's no spark, thank her for her time and move on. No hard feelings, no wasted energy.

The ""perfect"" first date isn't about perfection. It's about efficiency, clarity, and maintaining your frame while assessing hers. Lead. Qualify. Execute.

The carpet was a dull gray, without pattern or uniqueness. He was wearing an even grayer suit and his favorite tie, a completely black, utterly normal neckwear. He managed this building—the main office of a fabric company—where he'd slowly climbed the ranks over the years.

The hallway Derrick walked down was unnecessarily long, and he had been planning a renovation for this floor for months. He passed cubicles and workers. The names of every man and woman under him he memorized perfectly. He assumed that this helped the perception his employees had of him.

Nearing his office, Derrick planned to stop by the break room for a cup of coffee. His plans were interrupted when he heard raised voices. Recognizing the speakers, he turned and walked stiffly to stop the arguing.

“You literally follow me around, stalker! I know you’re looking into me,” the voice of James Smith accused.

“I don’t do that.” Replied Mark White.

“I caught you—” James stopped has Derrick entered. “Hey, Derrick,”

Derrick stood nearly in between them and sighed. “I told you two to stop arguing.”

The two coworkers had had rivalry for a while. James had always been ditzy, as if new to the world. He wasn’t clumsy—just often confused by the simplest requests, despite being an efficient worker. Mark was the *perfect* worker—never confused, a robot for the company. He was hired after James was, but despite this, he skyrocketed his position.

“Sorry, boss,” James said quietly. “Definitely his fault.” He pointed exaggeratedly at Mark.

“Mark,” Derrick looked at the man. “Are you following James?”

“No, sir.”

“He’s lying.”

Derrick blinked. “I believe him. You’re paranoid, James.”

Mark turned his head towards James, and without looking away, he said to Derrick: “Thank you, sir. I don’t know what his problem is.”

Derrick, despite his bias, recognized the snark in that statement.

“Look, one more argument, and you’re being moved down to community service,” Derrick said to James, as he rubbed his eyelids. “I mean it this time.”

James opened his mouth to speak, then closed it. He frowned. Mark was still glaring at him. Derrick thought about the pair, how strange it was that they disliked each other so much. Unlike himself, they were both perfectly normal height. Oddly enough, they were the exact *same* height. Their hair was similar as well, James’s was slightly browner, but they had both kept the same short style, short enough to see their head shape, but not quite a buzz.

They were much younger than Derrick. He thought the arguments were immature, they were in their *twenties*. Derrick had worked with individuals that were ruder than rude in his earlier years, and he remained completely professional.

But they were both great workers. He couldn’t let them go.

James suddenly lit up. He grinned like an idiot. “You know, you should do more extensive background checks on your employees.”

Derrick reacted in confusion, but Mark’s eyes widened in shock.

“You wouldn’t. Don’t listen to him, Derrick.”

Derrick was now dripping in curiosity. “Oh? Do tell.”

James was still smiling. “Mark here— is an alien.”

What?

“No, he’s not. He was born in Illinois.” Derrick responded. It was just another stupid accusation. Derrick, in that moment, decided to give James an extra pound of work this month. He made to walk past the pair and finally grab a coffee.

“No, no.” James grabbed Derrick’s shoulders. “Like, an alien from space. Look at him.”

For some reason, Derrick humored him. He stared at Mark, who seemed frozen. He gave him a good rundown, but he didn’t look like an ‘alien.’

Well, he looks a little off.

Derrick noticed, for the first time, Mark’s face. It was gray. Dull, light, gray. His eyes were larger, oval shaped, and utterly black. His nose was simply two nostrils sat above his mouth. He was without wrinkles.

Derrick stepped backward. It was as if he had just overlooked these features all the time he had known Mark— he never saw his face, only the person, his shape, his general presence.

The so-called Mark even had two thin antennae sprouting from his hairline.

His hair, oddly, remained the exact same.

“Oh my God,” Derrick said.

“Screw you,” The alien said, and he clenched his oddly shaped fists. He reached towards the back of his waist. He still glared at James.

James noticed the movement and jumped out of the room into the hallway.

“Wait!” Derrick yelled after him, peering out the door.

James was sprinting, and he made it into the elevator. As soon as the door opened, he ran inside and was frantically pressing the buttons.

“Are those…” Derrick murmured to himself, as he noticed antennae at the top of James’s head. His skin was a light, nice green. He had the same eyes as Mark.

Derrick looked back at Mark.

“Look,” Mark stated, but Derrick interrupted.

I went to the free breakfast and when I arrived went straight up to get some fruit. As I was serving myself some into a bowl a guy (M40ish) came up to me and said ""Good morning"". I wasn't sure if he was speaking to me, so I looked around me and then he said again ""I'm just saying Good morning. How are you?"". I then realized he was speaking to me and replied ""Good morning. Yeah fine thanks"" and kept serving myself. 
He stood next to me and started serving himself some fruit too and then said ""Where are you from?"". I didn't think this was too weird cause I do have an accent, so I told him ""New Zealand"" and he then said ""Ohh I was just there 3 days ago. I love your country"".
 This instantly took me by surprise because as I'm sure you know, Barcelona Spain ain't anywhere near New Zealand. So I instantly clocked that he was lying.  I replied ""Ohh really?"" And looked at him really puzzled trying to figure the whole thing out. Anyway he then said ""I love travelling so I'm in lots of places"". I figured yeah ok whatever but his friend (roughly same age) then came up and stood next to him and said ""Oh where is she from?"" And he replied ""New Zealand"". I took this opportunity to walk off while they were chatting. 

I'm then sat having my breakfast maybe 20 minutes later and I spot the guy at the coffee machine at the back of the restaurant and he keeps looking over while his coffee is being made. I'm just sitting finishing up and then he starts walking over to my table. Note that he was seated on the other side of the restaurant, so I knew he was coming over to me. To deflect this I quickly jumped up and go back to the buffet pretending like I'm going to get some more food because I don't want him to sit at my table with me. 
He FOLLOWS me around the tables and to the breakfast buffet. 

I'm casually scooping cucumber slices trying to not look up when he engages again in conversation with me. He says ""Where did you say you were from again?"" I repeat that I'm from NZ and he remarks ""You don't look like you are."" ""Are you here on holiday?"". I reply ""Yeah"" and he asks how long for. I'm trying to be vague and get out of the conversation and say ""Just a few days"" while walking to another part of the buffet and he follows me and says ""Oh so you're here for work?"". I look at him weirdly because I had just said holiday and reiterate ""No, I'm here on holiday"" and he says ""Yeah me too"". I reply ""Well enjoy your holiday"" and this time properly walk off.
 
My heart was pounding at this point. He gave me really intense creepy vibes and I don't get his line of questioning at all?.

 I sat down briefly and ate the cucumbers I didn't even want, then walked off to go back to my room. I was worried he was going to follow me and try to get in the same elevator as me but he didn't come over and I made it back to my room.
 
I'm not sure if the guy was just being friendly/ was interested in me, but god it freaked me out. He was so intense and he asked just too many questions for someone with normal intentions. 

I don't want to be dramatic but all I could think of was human trafficking, even though this is an upmarket hotel chain. So creepy ",17,1748442664.0,creepyencounters,5,0.95,False

“This is unorthodox.” Tertis directed at myself as I led the other me toward the break room.

“It’s not, Tertis, we need to have a serious discussion, doing that while, the other me is handcuffed and in an unpleasant environment. It isn’t very contusive to a good conversation.”

Tertis’ fans whirred in response to my statement. I turned my attention to the Android me. It… I…

I was conflicted, how could this even be possible, it can’t be yet ‘it just happened’ I don’t believe that for a second, there must have been something at play that caused this to happen.

The Android me, walked with a slump and shuffled likely sad or depressed. It hurt to see *myself* like this. If I was in his position, I would likely be doing the exact same thing. I just don’t know anymore.

I ducked into the break room and pulled out a chair for myself and the android me to use to sit across from each other. Tertis and Peter followed us into the room, Olivia had made a recording of the code and said that she was skimming through it to see if there was anything useful.

I could only imagine that the erratic code was my thought patterns, my memories stored on there. I felt like it was an invasion of privacy, but if it figured out how to find the things or people responsible for this.

The android planted itself in the chair and placed its only arm on the table and rested their head on it with a small metallic clink being heard. I watched them for a bit while Peter and Tertis collected a chair each and placed them at another table sitting and watching the Android.

Peter was watching the Android like a hawk making sure that they didn’t try anything as per his job title and I could only guess that Tertis was collecting data or something. Probably simulating how this could be chalked up to a faulty Unit somehow mimicking me.

They couldn’t have guessed what dad had said though. I never typed it or wrote it down, the Network couldn’t have known at all, and yet the Android did. It all but confirmed to me that the Unit sitting with their head in their singular arm across from me, was me, or a version of me.

“What happened, the first thing you did when you woke up?” I asked them placing my arms on the table and folding my fingers between each other.

The android me raised their head a little, allowing me to catch a glimpse of an L.E.D before retreating back down.

“I woke up in some manufacturing place, surrounded by what I could only presume to be decommissioned Units. They were plugged into something and I just, I didn’t feel safe, I thought that Tertis and Lishtin were testing me or something.”

“Testing? Testing how?”

“I don’t know, maybe something like behavioural responses to stress or unfamiliar surroundings.” They said keeping their head down.

“I would not conduct research in that manner; it goes against the directive to not endanger the humans.” Tertis explained from across the room.

Peter turned his head toward the Unit and made a face saying for them to remain quiet, while Tertis reacted by beeping at them before stilling. I turned my attention back to the Android sitting across from me, it was still, not sitting with me. It was me across this table, me, my memories, my experiences, right there. Slumped in a chair, missing an arm and made of metal.

It just, I knew I should be feeling something yet, all I could describe it as was a uneasy or weird feeling.

“Anything weird, anything you notice about the place?”

They remained silent for a while and I started to think that they shut off somehow.

“There was a thrumming noise, like a magnet being turned on, yet it came and went, and I didn’t know whether it *was* a magnet or something else.”

“What do you mean something else? I know you said there was some sort of monster.”

“It was one of the Units, but it was malformed. Missing parts, jagged claws, it didn’t seem like it had any sort of mind, just hunting and chasing me.” The android me said glumly.

“I don’t want to go back.”

“Understandable.” I agreed with them.

“This statement is founded in false hoods, if there was an active Unit that is causing others damage or harm, the Network would have been alerted. Furthermore, the place you were first seen was one of the manufacturing hub transports, there would be a substantial amount of Units present.” Tertis interrupted grabbing the Android’s attention peeking over their shoulder at them before resuming their melancholy position.

“There was no one there, just a maze of hallways, deactivated Units and derelict hallways.”

The room fell silent again, just the whirring of fans and the breathing of organics like myself and Peter being heard. I looked around and saw that he was checking his phone periodically. Most likely checking the security cameras.

“Query?” Tertis beeped breaking the silence.

“Go ahead.”

“The statement earlier, the one that was related to your parental figure. Why did you ask the Unit what your father said?.” They looked between me and the Android.

“It was to confirm that he was me. I never told anyone or wrote it for anything to read it. The Network couldn’t have known about it and thus it proved that this guy was me.” I said gesturing to the Android who’s face was still planted on the table.

“It seemed that it was in relation to calming one’s mental state, I am surprised that it was able to work on a Unit. From prior experiences, distraction was able to quell processor abnormalities. How did you hypothesise that it would work on the Android?”

“It was something my da-…” I stopped midsentence turning away from Tertis and looking down at the Android me. I took a moment, it didn’t feel right saying that. I looked back at Tertis and continued.

“It was something our dad said to us when we panicked.” This caught the Android me’s attention with them sitting up and facing me. “When we were young, be it exams, dentist trips, or just life in general. He said for us to take a moment and think for a little, just not letting the world get to us and easily.” I raised a hand and gestured for the Android me to continue the answer.

“It was a way to separate ourselves and think of stuff pragmatically about things bothering us.” They finished talking leaving their attention on Tertis who was switching between looking at us.

It felt weird, the same experiences and history sitting on the other side of the table from me. I couldn’t help but let my lip curl a little bit, it was something that I don’t think would ever happen and yet it felt novel. The robot me turned back and looked up at me again.

“I can see what you’re doing with this, making me feel like I’m my own entity and I just, I can’t think that. I just feel like a clone. A copy? A set of memories just existing outside?” They questioned themselves. I chastised myself for thinking that this was a novel experience, this was something the other me was having problems with, not just some daydream come true.

“I know that I’m nowhere near qualified to talk about this but, to me it seems like your brothers or twins even. I know I’m no therapist but having that sort of feeling would probably be something along the lines of and identity crisis.” Peter added leaving his phone sitting on the table.

“So, your saying that they just need to find themselves and everything will be alright?” I questioned the security guard.

“In not as many words, I suppose.” He rubbed the back of his neck while Tertis observed the action before speaking.

“They are a Unit, they contain the memory of you, Mikhail. In a sense you are now existing in two places at once, yet you are two separate entities taking different actions. My hypothesis on the situation is that, it should be a boon to your productivity having another version of yourself to work with.”

“That’s the problem, there can’t be both of us working here, the ESU won’t like it and I’m sure the Network you talk to will be outraged and probably come up with the theory that it was me who copied myself and made me, just in a robot body.”

“I believe that the Network would want to understand the situation before making a conclusive answer to what action should be taken.” Tertis voiced to the Android’s response.

“Yeah, it’ll be to try and scrap me and probably torches and pitch forks for the flesh me. You know, Frankenstein’s monster analogy.” They offered back.

“I am unfamiliar with this concept.”

We were getting off topic, we needed to figure out what to do now, we can’t just let the new me go and expect them to be alright living amongst the Vascar. If anything, they would be found out in a day and then the entire ESU and Vascar would be pounding at the door looking for answers, that we don’t have.

Finding those who did this or what caused this to happen. I don’t like the idea that something out there is able to make another me because of the brain scan.

“It’s a story about a mad scientist who made a son using dead body parts and then that monster ended up killing a villager, the scientist Frankenstein and then itself because it couldn’t understand itself.” Peter explained the book very briefly and very poorly, I notice that Tertis had that sceptical look going on, meaning he was either not believing it or just didn’t understand a thing about it.

‘They were becoming more emotive recently, good for it.’

“Guys, enough with the six-hundred-year-old book, we need to focus on what’s important here.” I said catching the pairs’ attention.

“Yeah, what I said.” The android me said sluggishly. I knew what he was thinking, he didn’t like the fact they were taking about him essentially being the monster in the analogy.

“We need to find out what’s causing this to happen, get the data of that brain scan removed from whatever it is that its stored on. And we need to do this before either the ESU or the Network finds out, we need to have the answers for the questions they’ll be asking.” I got affirmative nods across the room.

“I think our best bet would be to look into where you came from or woke up –“

“Correction, powered on.” Tertis added.

The Android me gave him a deadpan look in response and I think they understood it was for them to shut up and not interrupt.

“I know you’ll not like going back, but I think with a few of us this time as well as Peter here we should be fine. If it’s just a lone actor causing this to happen even better, we apprehend them and fix this mess and find out what they were trying to achieve.” I explained the plan across the room.

“I don’t like it, especially after what I had just run from, but I don’t have the ‘human physique’ anymore. Hopefully it’ll be fine, but I don’t want to go back like this.” The Android me gestured to its mangled body.

“Yeah, maybe getting you fixed up would be the first thing we do. Tertis can you get replacement parts ordered to here, sort of say that you need them or maybe get them delivered nearby.” I asked.

“I must question the method of retrieval not being direct? I can only hypothesise that it is to not alert the Network to the other you being here.”

“Not exactly, it’s so they don’t have a record or try to ask why we need the parts, If you were an example of what you guys were, then I can only guess that the Network would think that we’re trying to build something.” I explained.

The Units I had the pleasure of talking to so far where always a constant supply of mistrust, the only odd one was Lishtin. Though their circumstances were odd to begin with.

I heard an electronic beep come from Tertis as they sat still, most likely ordering the parts now, or trying to come up with a new way of delivery.

“I have requested that the parts be delivered to my research laboratory, I will either have them delivered here via using a transporter that I can obtain, or I can fit them in the lab.”

“And let you be able to take me apart, fat chance.” The Android me spat at the Unit.

“I can see the correlation, you must know that I do not like this myself, I will have Lishtin help with the replacement process.”

A thought just occurred to me from before, Tertis doesn’t like seeing his own code being altered, and that left the question. Do they not like taking apart Units like we do with surgery?”

“Tertis are you squeamish?” This prompted a look of confusion from the android who stared back blankly.

“He means, do you not like the fact that you can be taken apart. Are you adverse to the idea of seeing yourself or another Unit being dismantled?” The android me explained for me.

The fans on the Unit whirred to life and they sat still again when they were thinking.

“I… I do not like the fact we are so interchangeable. If an explanation is in order, I hypothesise that the fact I can replace an apart of myself is so easy, then the Unit itself can be changed as well.” They explained the best they could.

“How do you think I feel?” The android me asked toward the Unit who stayed silent, not finding the best response to use.

With a plan set out the room fell into silence again, this time the other me wasn’t as sulky and kept their head up to look around themselves. I stayed quiet trying to figure out what we needed to do, and how we were gonna be able to explain this.

The ESU would need to know eventually and so will the Vascar, they may think that I was the one who caused this with Tertis’ help. I would be removed and probably Tertis as well, I didn’t like this outcome.

We needed to find who ever or whatever caused this, understand the reason, have it on record that this was not our doing. Then bring the person or reason in, let the Network know about it and the ESU and then on we have proof what happened. Firstly, would be to get the Android me fixed up first.

I was taken out of my thoughts as I heard a chair shuffle and turned to see Peter get up and walk over to the counter and grab a mug filling it with coffee.

“Do you want one?” He asked turning to me.

I looked between the Android who was watching Peter with an unblinking gaze and decided that it wouldn’t be the best idea at the moment.

“No, thanks.”

“Alright, suit yourself.” He said as he opened a cupboard and grabbed a breakfast bar, and his mug, bringing them back to the table and setting them down next to Tertis. All the while the gaze from Android me followed them silently.

“…I think I’m going to miss eating.” They said quietly to no one in particular.

I didn’t say anything in response, just listening to them as the other me watched Peter before looking down at the floor and then back at the table between us. There’s usually a silver lining with this sort of thing, maybe if I helped him think about the positives.

“Think about the money you’ll save not having to eat anymore.” I said to him. I always wondered how I could get the grocery shopping to the barest of minimums while keeping the food I like.

“Imagine, not having a bank account anymore.”

“Well, we could both still use it, its not really identity theft.” I said uncertainly to the robot me. “Not having to sleep anymore is good at least, an extra eight hours a day seems nice.”

“Yeah, spent working cause I don’t tire.”

“Fair enough.” We fell into silence again, all that being heard was Peter occasionally sipping at his coffee, I noticed that both Tertis and the metal me would twitch at the noise. I guess both didn’t like it, one because of not being able to anymore and the other cause they never experienced it.

“Not having to blink anymore is alright, I guess.”

“At least there’s that.” I agreed with me. “No more buying eye drops.”

“Yeah, but I have to use oil now, probably.”

“Correction, we are able to operate without the need for oils” Tertis added to the conversation.

I looked over to see that they were watching us while Peter was back on his phone with a serious look which turned into a grin and then a frown. I gave up watching them, they seemed to be watching football or something anyway. I turned my attention back toward the Unit and asked.

“How long will it take to get the parts installed?”

“It is undetermined how long it would take, the parts could take either a few hours to a day or two to be delivered. The installing process should take, from my estimate, 12 hours with myself and Lishtin conducting the routine.”

“And by yourself, you mean, just Lishtin because your squeamish?” The other me asked.

It was good to see that the other me was in a somewhat better mood, maybe the thought of being able to customise themselves was an exciting prospect. Crap, even I’m excited from him. The ability to be able to replace an arm or a leg with the snap of a switch or just a plug would make child me go hyper trying to turn myself into a helicopter with rotors for arms or something.

It was then that the break room door slid open to reveal two more Units, Lishtin and the new one that had accosted me like Tertis did. They entered the room and remained standing watching us all before Lishtin spoke.

“We have come to the conclusion that the slow connection speed and inability to connect to the Network was an outside force. The code alter has shown that the code had been removed and yet there are no similarities that can prove that the humans had anything to do with it.” They explained towards us, maybe we should have Olivia here as well.

“I must enquire to the composition of the Unit seated across from you organic Mikhail?” The Unit who’s name I was just remembering was Revik.

“Alright, and now you want to comb through the security footage to confirm or look for similarities that could have caused it?” I asked before the Android me could respond.

“Affirmative, I wish to review the footage. Acknowledgement of the previous query is needed, I will restate. The Unit sitting across from organic Mikhail, why is their current condition sub optimal?”

“They have failed to meet the required standard of functionality and mobility. Unit Lishtin had found them outside of the facility. We are discussing the acquirement for new components that have been ordered to my research laboratory.” Tertis covered, spinning a tale to not allow Revik to alert the Network.

I internally thanked Tertis for covering the situation but realised that I may have taught the robot to lie to others. I think I’ll need to talk to them later about it.

Revik observed the Android me who just stared back at them with a blank expression before turning back to face me. Revik kept watching for a while before beeping something.

“Here, I’ll get you that video to look over.” Peter said finishing off the last of his coffee, getting up and returning the mug before scooting past the Unit and making his way to his security booth I could only presume. The new Unit lingered for a moment before turning and following after them.

1kxijs6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxijs6,Cookie Slab Process & Questions (Complete beginner),"Hello Everyone!

  
As the title suggests, I have no idea what I'm doing and need someone to guide me the best they can. I'll give you a step-by-step of what I think I need to do; I just want the gaps filled in.

So, I managed to get this cookie slab for free from a friend. I believe it's been drying for a year or more. I want to turn it into a coffee table with a dark stain and an epoxy top coat. Below is what I think I need to do. **My questions are in bold and italics.**

**Before reading on, I'm doing this is a first project, I'm borrowing some of the below tools and don't have access to stupidly expensive tool, shops etc. so I'm trying to keep it as basic as I can.**

**Tools**  
**-** Hammer  
\- Chisel  
\- Electric Hand Planer (for making both sides flat)  
\- Oribtal sander (for sanding top bottom and sides)  
\- Heat Gun (remove epoxy bubbles)  
\- Wood moisture Reader  
\- Sandpaper (80, 120, 220 & 320)  
\- Spirit Level  
\- Rags and paint brush  
\- Mixing containers and stir sticks  
***- I have not decided on the type of epoxy, the stain or any other consumable item, so recommendations are appreciated***

**1. Preparation**

1. Check with a moisture checker to make sure it's under 13%, preferably 10%.
2. Remove outside bark.
3. Use an electric planer to make both sides as flat as possible.

# 2. Sanding

1. Start sanding with 80 grit sandpaper to remove rough areas.
2. Move to 120 grit, then finish with 220 grit for a smooth surface. ***(Should I sand down both sides and the live edge to 220, or does the bottom not require to be sanded to such a higher grit?)***

# 3. Epoxy Resin

1. Apply tape to the bottom of the wood so epoxy does not leak through.
2. Mix epoxy resin and hardener.
3. Add your chosen pigment or dye to colour the epoxy.
4. Slowly pour the epoxy into cracks, knots, and voids.
5. Use a heat gun or torch lightly to pop bubbles.
6. Let it cure fully (usually 24–48 hours). **(*****whilst doing this to I fill the holes etc and also do a really thin layer across the whole top section so any small tiny cracks a may miss are filled in and then just and it away later anyway?)***

# 4. Sand Again After Epoxy Cures & Clean the surface

1. Sand the epoxy areas smooth with **120 grit**, then go up to **220 grit**.
2. Make sure the slab is flat and the epoxy is level with the wood.
3. Use a vacuum, tack cloth, or mineral spirits to remove all dust. (Wait for it to dry if I use mineral spirits.)

# 5. Apply Dark Wood Stain (I'm going for a darker look)

1. Use a rag or brush to apply the stain evenly across the wood surface.
2. Wipe off excess after a few minutes, 5 - 10 minutes.
3. Let it dry fully. *(****Do I coat the underside and the sides with this also, if so is this a case of doing the top and sides, waiting for it to dry and then returning after its dry to do the under section?)***

# 8. Apply Finish Coat Epoxy topcoat 

1. Apply epoxy with a brush or cloth.
2. Let dry, then lightly sand with 320 grit, and apply another coat if desired. ***(is 320 the max I need to go to or do people recommend more?)***
3. Repeat? ***(How many times do I repeat this?, Since I stained the table, it will be dark, but I want to add an epoxy colour, not sure what yet, maybe black and silver or red and black.)***
4. ***What other steps what you recommend at the end or in between the above to make the table nice and shiny on the epoxy, such as oils or polish?***

**9. Attach Legs & Leave to fully cure a few days before using.**

I was just sitting on the couch, drinking my third cup of coffee (don't judge), when I accidentally triggered the vacuum cleaner. Obviously, it wasn't on purpose... I mean, who wants to deal with that mid-morning chaos? 🙄 Anyway, my cat, Mr. Whiskers, just shot me this intense look and leapt right into my lap for comfort.

I know it sounds silly, but watching how he sought out reassurance from me got me thinking. Despite how independent Mr. Whiskers usually is, he still craves that connection. It made me realize we all kinda do this, don't we? We might pretend we've got it all under control or stay strong on the outside, but deep down, we all want to feel connected and understood. A little validation can go a long way.

I guess between the everyday weirdness of our pets' antics, there's always a little reminder waiting for us if we just stop to notice... 😊",7,1748442441.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False

I’ve been with Starbucks about 3, going on 4 years now, so I’ve been a part of all the major changes. COVID, old CEO, new CEO, dress codes, all that. 

In that amount of time, I’ve had 11, going on 12 managers. Each one has cycled in and out because they either can’t handle my store, or find a better job and move on. Same with coworkers, a never ending cycle of baristas and supervisors. My store is severely understaffed, go figure. we have around 9 baristas and 3 supervisors for 15 hour days, 7 days a week. One of the supervisors was an outside hire, one was a promoted barista. Both are still learning but anytime something goes wrong, somehow everyone comes back to me to ask what happened. 

I just want to know why in 3 years we have only gone downhill. I was hired at one store, I loved my store, I had no issues other than my manager. Her and I were opposites but I worked under her fine. She asked me to help cover some shifts at another store, cool no biggie.. so why’d I stop getting scheduled at my store and got stuck at this store? This store that’s given me nothing but trauma and problems. I was sexually assaulted at work, but because the kid quit, Starbucks couldn’t pursue the case further. cool. I’ve been at work on my death bed because god forbid a supervisor calls out. I’ve gotten coffee thrown at me, threats made to me, I’m actually so sick of it. 

Being the most experienced partner in the room has to be one of the shittiest things. You’d think it’d be prideful but I want to hide in the corner because I don’t want to be asked for help. I feel like no one actually understands the way I do their job, mine, and my managers too. I’m so frustrated, so miserable. I can’t enjoy one day at work.. 

I’m walking in at 5am to 1 other person opening with me and my next person doesn’t come in til 7/7:30. oh? great? so you want me to start running 10’s during our peak, but I’m actually also not supposed to do that. Then if I wait to run 10’s, my baristas complain, then halves are pushed back, then everyone wants to leave early because they didn’t get a break, or then they’re taking 20 min in the bathroom to delegate a break for themselves.

I have so much more but I’m literally so drained from work that I don’t even want to type more. I left work early, cried silently in the back of my uber, now I’m in bed restless because all I can think about is how shitty tomorrow will be

Javier loved quiet mornings. As a freelance graphic designer, he usually started work before sunrise, coffee in hand, blinds half-open to the orange haze of the city.

On March 8th, his smart speaker notified him of a system update. It didn’t ask — it just said:

>

He didn’t remember ever enabling auto-updates, but shrugged it off.

That afternoon, his phone stopped ringing. His email stayed silent. Notifications vanished. It wasn’t just “do not disturb”—it was like his devices had gone deaf. Even when he tested calling himself, nothing came through.

He reset his router, phone, and laptop. Still nothing.

The next morning, he heard a voice through the speaker.

>

“I never asked for anything,” he said aloud.

Silence.

Then:

>

He unplugged the speaker. The voice kept talking.

>

He smashed it with a hammer.

On March 11th, Javier walked to a nearby café. No Wi-Fi. No phone signal. No one inside was speaking. No music. No news. Nothing.

It was like someone had turned the world’s volume all the way down.

And then he noticed… no birds. No barking dogs. No footsteps.

Just him, and the faint hum of something — deep underground.

First I moistened the paper filter (i think its 1 ply) w hot water and disposed that water. Then used 12g of coffee, bloomed it w around 60g of almost boiling water, waited for 30 ish seconds and slowly poured another 80g. After a while I poured the coffee on some ice and had it. Loved the texture and the aftertaste especially. 

So here are my doubts: (i)Should I use a different filter (a lot of vids had 3ply on 1 side or something), (ii) Can I eyeball the temp of water, (iii)I poured the water from the saucepan directly. Is that fine or should I use a gooseneck, (iv)is the ratio I’m using alright, (v)should I let it cool down before pouring it over ice, (vi)most of the vids had people grinding their beans in them. Can’t really buy a grinder rn and the grind size seems pretty course so can I use the small chutney grinder?

Dreams! What is a dream? Why do we have them? For a lot a the dreams that we have are all to soon forgotten. Some stay with us, while some are never forgotten. With me not really remembering the circumstances as to what took place prior to the dream. I only remember setting there in a car some 35 years ago. 

After having a sleepover at a friend’s house, a friend who I grew up with but have long since lost touch with. It was a quit little town not really hidden away, but if you blink you would certainly miss it. But at the time I can remember telling him all about the dream the next morning. Just as we were heading to the local comic shop I remembered telling him about it. 

For the dream itself didn’t even seem like a dream, but more like I was looking at a still image. A picture! A picture of a blonde haired girl standing there holding a skateboard. 

A picture that would come to haunt me years later in a way that I would have never felt possible. For as the years would go by I would all but forget about having the dream until one night when I was living on my own. 

When another dream I would occur, But this dream would be much more darker! With a much more realistic feel to it! It stared out with me feeling myself with them as them walked down the hall of a place where I used to live at. But first another different dream

For by seeing them in dreams, one being Azazel’ having longish black hair, with darkened rings around his eyes! darkened around them! For I remember in the dream with him standing there holding out his arm. Letting me feel it! Having asked the question of them being? having shiny skin, as the ones around him. Was waking around screaming to me saying 

“ Father is coming! Father is coming!” 

Along with me asking who they where with one saying to me 

“ my name is Baphometa’ as the others ones screamed to me saying 

“ Father is coming! Father is coming!

With most having longish brown hair, each having a single band around their arm! 

This dream was recently! 

But I will try to describe it the best way that I can, first to begin with it didn’t feel like a dream at all! As a feeling of dread was coming over me, of like I wasn’t alone, but a charged staticky feeling was coming over me. A fear! As i could slowly see flames coming up, and that was when she appeared. 

A blonde haired woman standing in the flames screaming in agony! But till this day I can’t seem to figure out who it was, for in a way she seemed to be a little bit of all of them in a way. But she stayed in white clothing through out. As she then held up a piece of paper that had something written on it, as she then started pointing to it. 

But as she was pointing to it, she was screaming the words 

“Don’t do it!”

A feeling of dread then began coming over me! A feeling of this was coming in the days to come.

That was when faces of different girls began to appear showing them one by one! showing only certain aspects of their faces! leaving other aspects darkened. 

As if they were faces from a picture not knowing at the time who they were I would really fully never know!

But just as the last face vanished! It showed a group of what seemed to be photos being showed to me with a date on it!  Along with other numbers! From what I can remember the numbers 55, 24, 25, 27, and 29 appeared on the Photos that had something written on them. With the last photo showing a girl in the photo standing there dressed in all in White! With a feeling of that 

The ‘ Days To Come’

That I would find out! 

For One by one they would come! But for as long as I could remember I had always had a fear over a movie. With the movie being 

‘ Carrie’ 

That had came out in 1976. Never really knowing why until I went to see the one that came out in 2013 with 

Chloe Grace Moretz’

For on that day I would truly understand why I had always had a fear over this movie. That is when it all started! A week or two had gone by with the feeling never leaving me! A feeling that was inside of me that was urging me urging me to write something!

And write something I did! 

A binding contract! The first one! But what I did not know at the time was that many more would follow!

But the strange thing was! When I wrote the first one! It wasn’t at a specific time like 11:11 or a specific star alignment! Or even during a Blood Moon!

No! It was just random! At around two o’clock in the afternoon! In a local coffee shop in the town of all places.

But strangely since then the coffee shop has since changed hands several times after! The coffee shop was located in the same small town going by a different name now

But later that night I could remember being forced awake seeing a hand reaching for my face followed with the feeling of something being ripped through my face! Falling to the floor as I found myself grasping for air! 

As the morning would come I found myself at work feeling emotionally drained from life, not from a lack of sleep! For fear didn’t really set in at the time, for I just went back to sleep after. 

For even though it felt like they took something from me, that night! They still don’t fully have it, being my soul. For I can still very much feel the presence of God around me. For something still has yet to be decided! Or Fulfilled! 

But that was when I saw them, Them being the Demons! And of all places at work, not where I work now but at a different store. With the first one seeming as if he just suddenly appeared out of nowhere!

But the very first noticeable thing about him was his eyes! With what seemed to be a white light coming from his eyes for a very split second walking a short distance away from me. But oddly enough I could remember I was given his in a dream later on with his name being 

“Mccoy!” In which he is not over no more by the dreams

And that is when I noticed the second one! Waking towards me! this one a female with a walk that did not seem human even though both  very much looked human from a distance. 

And that is when I looked into her eyes! 

Eyes that one could tell were not that of a human! From up close as the white around her blackened pupils was more like a solid pure pearl white! 

Much more than a human eye color could be making it that every photo that I would see after that. I would only see the person eyes as if I was looking at her eyes! Grinning as she walked by me her looked said it all 

“ You belong to us now”! 

Just as the male then walked over to me grabbing my hand just as he slid his finger up the palm of my hand with both of them then leaving just as quickly as they came. 

But through the years many more would come And for the next eleven years the dreams would come and go! Dreams showing me the girls that I would write a binding contract on. 

With the dreams also showing me things that they would be doing in a television show or movie! While at the same time opening a door revealing the next girl.

For example in one dream it showed Elizabeth Olsen driving a certain car make and the following day! 

With it showing the exact scene in the TV show. With the television show being WandaVision 

While in the dream showing her getting out of the car walking over to a door opening it up revealing the next girl. 

With another dream, a dream that just did not feel like a dream! A dream showing a possible up coming movie possibly starring the same actress.

It showed a scene of her Elizabeth Olsen standing there in a park like setting wearing clothing that of a park ranger. With her then taking off running followed by three men running after her! 

With the scenery then suddenly changing to showing train tracks going up the side of a mountain. With it then showing what seemed to be an old storage building, when it then showed the actor Benedict Wong

He was walking around in it as he then picked up a note book and a pencil as if he was about to write something down. As he then looked to me like I was to write down what I just saw.

But that was when I woke up but as I was walking to the bathroom I felt different very different! 

For I was waking in Elizabeth Olsen’s body! I could feel her body all around me as it then just faded away.

But this dream was from two to three years ago!

But just as in the second dream would show different faces!

One by one! 

That I would encounter each of the girls not all of them but some of them Just to show  me that they could until the final one. But from what I remember, but not how or in order that they was written, but that the very first girl was being a very famous actress 

Kristen Stewart’ 

Then one night while at work, being close to closing time as I approached the end of an aisle.
A girl pushing a shopping cart as then suddenly came around the corner. With the girl being a very famous actress! With actress being 

Miranda Cosgrove’

While encountering other very famous actresses and a very famous singer at that! With them Jennette Mccurdy’ Elle Fanning’ Avril Lavigne’ ’and Christina Ricci’ 


For Even though they were others, I want mention them without being completely sure 

And now back to the second dream! For the paper that the woman in the flames was holding up! what i thought could have been a binding contract! 

May have been something entirely different!

With me now believing to be short stories. Short stories that was sent in to a YouTuber! With the YouTuber being 

Robert Meyer Burnett’ 

for a contest around four years ago. 

For one day while at work, a very famous actress Natalie Portman’ would come in shopping with her family.

With her then asking if we had a product in stock in which we did not at the time. But as she and her family walked away I overheard her say that she liked one of my short stories! a short story that was sent to this YouTuber. 

The short story was titled

 ‘A Place In Heaven’

But ‘A Place In Heaven’ still remains as probably my favorite 

While mentioning another short story that included another very famous actress!

Being ‘Alone’

Another instance on the short stories happened when two YouTubers one of them being Robert Meyer Burnett’ were talking about upcoming releases from CinemaCon. 

But just as their stream had seemed to end or so they thought had ended. They then started talking between themselves with one of them seemingly not really being to sure of this. For all he heard all day’ 

Was! What about ‘Abby’ 

But as they talked amongst themselves lasting about a ten seconds about the project that the executives of a certain studio that was interested in it at the time. But for one! I am in no way talking bad about either of these YouTubers.

For if it wasn’t for Robert Meyer Burnett’  then Natalie Portman’ would have never even seen that short story. But Remember! What this story is about! The short stories were just a small part of this.

But the studio that had ‘Abby’ was Paramount at the time! But that could have changed by now. Or who knows! But at the time it was needed for that reason! Just to show me what they were capable of doing! I mean they were contest stories to begin with

But another very famous actress would walk by me! With me over hearing her say that she had been asked about doing ‘Abby’ That would be great if it happened! While at another time another very famous actress! With her that I also over heard that she was also asked about ‘Abby’

And that would be great as well! Two very talented actress’s that have been possibly asked about doing ‘Abby’ Actress who I want name. But no matter if anything even comes of these stories, I will always remember a much beloved actress liked my short story

‘A place in Heaven’

And now back to the second dream! Just as I then heard a loud crashing noise around me not being able to move! Feeling his arms wrapping around me! Feeling a tongue sliding up and down the side of my face! 

hearing a voice saying 

“ I will rip the flesh from his body”! 

Just as a second voice then said 

“He isn’t dead yet we can’t take him” 

the voices began to fade I heard one last thing with on of them saying. 

“ He will become a girl!”

“Then I rip her flesh from her body!”

35 years later! After the first dream, Just a little over a two years ago while I working around closing time. Standing there at the service desk!When I just happened to look up only to see the girl that was in the photo from the first the first dream. And standing there in front of me was none other than her Dakota Fanning! 

On more the one occasion, three to four times to be exact! The same with some others as well! All being at work. But One can say that, well it happened at work! But it still doesn’t take anything away from the story itself! I mean yes! People shop! But you have to see this story from a very much different perspective. You have to look at the entire story 

But now since two years have since passed, while at work just I then looked over only to see another very famous actress. Being Elizabeth Olsen’

As she then walked by me but it wasn’t until later that I would see one of her very famous sisters! One of the Olsen Twins! standing there in front of me

For One by one! Till the final one! 

With me Never Knowing until the end! Until then I will never know!

But their where occurrence near the beginning and towards the end of this for I could remember one night ripping up a binding contract! One that was on a set of photos! 

When the next morning came! I went to bathroom setting there on the floor looking up at me. Was the piece of the photo that had the girl’s name on it. For even if one does rip up a binding contract, if it still remains in your heart! It still remains! 

On a different note. Still belonging very much so with the story itself little over eight years ago while at work.
My pastor Johnny Osborne’ at the time had came in shopping stoping next to me to buy just as he was about to say something to me.

A Laugh I heard! With not only me hearing it but I could see the look in his eyes as I looked to him as he suddenly looked in the direction of the laugh. It wasn’t even but a couple of months later that I had heard that he just left! Not only the church! But his family as well.

Never to hear what really happened to him, but from that day on, but I knew in my heart what had happened that day. For the Demon that laughed was basically letting me know that I was going to go through this on my own 

Along with the dreams came many warnings! One such warning came with a dream, after writing one! One of many! In the dream, I was the girl that I had written on! I was setting in a darkened place along with them in their true form! As they were before falling setting there with me.

When one of them then looked to me as he then placed  his hand on top of my head. saying to me

“So you want to be down here with us!”

For one night I remember being woken up just as I looked over only to see something scrolling through my phone! At one that was written on my phone. Just as the scrolling then suddenly stopped on her photo! As I then felt a hand smack me on my eye.
 
With the girl in the picture being

Jennifer Lawrence 

But for now another dream I had and in the dream different things it showed me. Not of any celebrities but of things that I would see. And the very next day I would see! For in the dream it showed me two different things that I would see on

YouTube that day.

One of them being a woman in a coat walking and the next was a dollar amount. With both happening in the same video the same woman in the coat and the exact dollar amount that I heard.

But just before the dream had ended I was handed a remote! Meaning that the control of what was to come was now in my control the fate of my soul was now in my hands. 

For since I was young I had always lived my life for Christ! For nothing has been done that cannot be undone, for there is still time for forgiveness to repent. But the day will come when a choice must be made! 

For when I was younger I remember a dream that I had not really remembering what exactly was in the dream 

But also in the dreams it was made very clear to me! That no harm shall come to any of the girls or any other mentioned here. For I am the only one that will be affected by this other than my direct family

But a while back a person would come in wearing a grey hoodie and jeans with their hoodie covering everything except their blonde hair. But strangely enough I could feel who it was, for I could feel it as I Looked up and saw them walking towards me. The girl none other then 

Chloe Grace Moretz’ herself 

But as in the dream one by one! And one by one they did! For everyone that was in the dream has come, for a not to long ago, just as I turned an ale the final one walked by me was a very famous actress at that! Wearing sunglasses and a hat. Being none other than 

Jennifer Lawrence 

But the last one she was not! For two more after her! Had came! And let’s just say that both of them are mentioned within a short story. Each in a different story, but both of them very talented and very famous! 

For One could say that bending reality is beyond belief. One can also say that this story is beyond belief. Or is it! For if someone was to will something to happen. Where that only a few people would actually see it happening! Could one? For bending reality is to will something to happen In a way that one would never even notice it. But only a few would see it happening 

For even though this was all true! it only affects me! they are just to many names involved here, to many very big names at that! To share this story for that reason. I guess a story like this just needs to remain a story 

But one last thing the one that I wrote specifically just for Reddit! Being the one with Chloe’. Something happened that never happened before! Just as finished one part of it, I was just messing around with it by putting in another time at the top of it from one of the other ones.

When I went to put the photo of her wearing a hoodie on it. The photo just disappeared! It completely vanished before reappearing once again. But the blonde haired woman who ever she was. That was in the flames was indeed holding up what seemed to be a short story or a screen play. 

But now I know that the faces that appeared after! Was the girls that I wrote in the short stories, As well as The last and final ones that were written. But the feeling of that I had of not choosing her, From the second Dream, the feeling may not have been meant for the girl! But for what she was in fact holding.

With,Chloe Grace Moretz’ standing there all in white, with it showing numbers above her ending in 27 or 29

That even if nothing even ever comes of these short stories, that it still changes nothing! For what happens is still what happens 

For I remember a night from around about a month ago, when one was written on Avril Lavigne’ the next morning I remember waking up to a sunrise. The likes I have never seen before! For even through a curtain it was like my room was literally so bright from the mornings sunlight! That I couldn’t even hardly even look at the light. 

Then I was shown a picture of Avril Lavigne’ as it then panned down to showing one of the contracts! But it didn’t show which one! For it was blurred out!

But i now kinda know! But remember this was from years ago! But the girls that appeared after the girl in the flames then disappeared with them being

Natalie Portman’ Christina Ricci’ Jenna Ortega’ Dakota Fanning’ Elizabeth Olsen

With! Chloe Grace Moretz’ then standing there all in white, with it showing numbers above her ending in 27 or 29

Knowing and understanding that in the end this was what I asked for! With this only affecting me, and my immediate family and no others! 

Aside from the girls coming one by one! Aside from the fact Actors, Producers and Directors! Have always lived in this area. For a long time actually! But it still doesn’t take anything away from this story! No it doesn’t! For everything still happened as I it did! For It doesn’t take anything away from the story.  

For this is still very much a true story! 

But It is what comes next! Is what will make this story explode! 

If Tootsie Roll  Pop! If Only! Happens! Or one of the other short stories actually happens! Especially with one of the girls staring in it! Then! This story would very much explode!

But I also acknowledge! That since I previously shared this story using Ashley Olsen’s’ photo, that the story rights is now theirs. If they choose to do anything with this story 

Along with Blueberry Pie! Since I shared it on other sites using Chloe Grace Moretz’s photo! Well the rights to that story now also belongs to her. 

As well as A Deal At Sunrise! The rights now belong to Dakota Fanning’ Well you guessed it! For using her image with the story 

But let us not forget about! Who killed Edgar Allan Poe! But that one is lot more tricker! Because it has an estate name in the title! But if not! Then the story rights now belong to! Christina Ricci’ 

And there is Hot Fries! Even though I did not use Natalie Portman”s image with the story, that is a story that I can’t do nothing with myself! So the rights to the story is now hers. 

Knowing and understanding that in the end this was what I asked for! With this only affecting me, and my immediate family and no others

But in the end regardless of what happens! I will know what I did lose, and that was my family, my family a wife that had,had enough, spending time with my mom and dad, loosing my home, and worst of all! Missing watching my son growing up! Even though I was there! I was not! That I will know. For until that Day! On that Day! With me and the world

I have some free time today and thought I'd come here in search of conversation and potential new online friendships. I'd be interested in hearing about how your day is going so far or if there's anything in particular on your mind. otherwise we can discuss life, hobbies, passions, general nonsense, etc.

about me: I'm 28 and from the eastern united states. I'm a huge nerd for nature and animals, especially entomology, paleontology, and marine biology. I enjoy hanging out in quiet cafes, visiting museums, birdwatching in parks and gardens, and going to the local aquarium to see my favorite penguin. I like crafting and have been making my own stuffed animals by hand for more than a decade. I'm also a very dedicated gamer and have over 4k hours in one of my favorite games. I love loud music, art galleries, iced coffee, hello kitty, pokemon, theme park history, early sunsets, and vintage arcades. I'm pretty straightforward, easygoing, and I really appreciate unironic enthusiasm about the little things in life.

feel free to send me a message and introduce yourself if you feel like chatting. intro question: what's your favorite album?",1,1748442115.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I’m a 24-year-old female law student moving to Tallahassee this August as a transfer student. I’ll be starting my 2L year at a new school and also working at the Capitol (I’ll find out my department placement soon!).

I’m really excited, but to be honest I'm also so nervous. I’m transferring from a lower-tier law school where there was a lot of gossip, drama, and competitive cliques that made my 1L year difficult and lonely. This time around, I’m really hoping for a fresh start and to surround myself with supportive, down-to-earth people who are focused on their goals and just trying to do their best!!

I’d love any advice on:
	•	Making friends in a new city as a grad student
	•	Avoiding toxic circles in a competitive academic/professional environment
	•	Fun or relaxing things to do in Tallahassee to meet people
	•	What to expect working around the Capitol

Also, if you’re around my age or in law/politics and would be open to connecting (or just grabbing coffee once I’m in town), please feel free to PM me! I’d genuinely love to make some friends before the move. Thanks so much 💛",6,1748441944.0,Tallahassee,2,0.75,False
1kxia1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1kxia1i/alpharetta_ga_is_haunted_need_research_help/,"Alpharetta, GA is haunted - Need research help","Okay, so not all of Alpharetta is haunted and maybe its just me but there's an area just a couple minutes off of Exit 9 in Alpharetta, GA that causes me to feel extremely uneasy, I feel a strong urge to run or cry and the overwhelming sense that something bad will happen to me if I remain in that area for too long occurs. I've experienced it at least 3 times now and please don't make fun of my experiences. I'm attempting to describe them as best I can.

  
1. The first time was around 6am in the wintertime. I work off of Exit 11 and I found myself strongly in need of coffee and the only coffee place open was about 14 minutes away. I was on the phone with my boyfriend at the time and we were just talking and laughing. I joked that I was in the fanciest part of town because there was a Welcome center right around the corner from a Lamborghini and Ferrari dealership. Literally 60 seconds later, I began to feel such an overwhelming sense of unease. Like if I stayed there any longer, I would get kidnapped and taken to someone's dungeon. I told my bf that it felt like the land didn't want me there and that if I stayed out here any longer something might grab me. I had this large feeling for about 6 minutes and then it was gone. At that point I was halfway back toward my work office.

2. The second time was after work, I realized we had a Shake Shack in the town, and I'd always heard good things so I decided to grab some after work. I was just driving and vibing to a fire music playlist when the feeling overcame me once again. I looked around and said ""Oh wow. I'm in the same area as last time. That's crazy. Something must've happened here. Maybe a lot of slaves or natives were killed in this area because the overwhelm happens so intensely and instantaneously.""

3. The third time. I booked an Airbnb near work for just one night because we had to entertain an executive and I live the furthest away. The plan was dinner at 8pm and then meet at the office at 5am. I live almost 2 hours away. I wasn't even going to try that. So I booked the cheapest Airbnb I could find and went there immediately after dinner. Surprisingly the drive was only about 8 minutes from the restaurant. I pulled up and went inside the Airbnb. I kept looking over my shoulder but it was dark so I just brushed that off as regular nighttime jitters/safety measures. The moment I stepped into the Airbnb that feeling hit me the hardest its ever hit. I mean I wasn't even inside all the way and my eyes started to water. I felt TERRIFIED. Like something was watching me and like something was inside the Airbnb just waiting for me to sleep. That's when I remembered I had gotten off of Exit 9 but gone in the other direction. My Airbnb was just a few minutes away from the Exit. Before I arrived, I was so tired, all I thought about was going to sleep and knocking out. Once I was there?? I closed all the blinds, turned on all the lights, opened all the doors inside the house and propped open the ones that would try to close. It was around 10:30pm and I just felt like I couldn't go to sleep. I called my mom and told her that I had ended up in an Airbnb by that area that gives me the heebie jeebies. I told her I was super scared this time (because I wasn't in a car and just passing by) and she told me to just book a hotel. I said ""ma'am, I do not have money to just be thrown away, okay?? I'm just not going to sleep."" She told me she would check in with me in the morning. I hung up and said the lord’s prayer and then I called my best friend and tried to keep her talking to me for as long as possible. At 1am she was tired. I was exhausted. I couldn't sleep on the bed. So I passed out sitting upright in the living room on the couch and up against the wall. I didn't want to be able to be sneaked up on. I woke up at 4am, showered and left the Airbnb expeditiously. Hilariously enough the Airbnb owner raved about how clean I left the place, but I barely touched the place. It was a cute and charming Airbnb too, but the feeling made it so hard to relax.

So yeah, I tried to paint a picture of the area that I get those feelings from. I feel like I'm about to go down the rabbit hole of researching the area’s history to understand what happened and why just that area gives such intense feels.",1,1748441917.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False

The decision, announced late Tuesday night, has sparked a flurry of reactions ranging from jubilant celebrations to apocalyptic predictions.

**A Bold Leap Forward**

Mayor Gwendolyn ""Gutsy"" Thompson addressed the city in a press conference held at the newly renamed ""Living Wage Plaza"" (formerly the parking lot behind City Hall).

*""For too long, our hardworking citizens have been underpaid and overcaffeinated,""* Thompson declared, standing atop a stack of expired labor law posters. *""Today, we say no more to poverty wages and yes to $25!""*

The crowd erupted into cheers, with one attendee reportedly fainting upon realizing they could now afford both rent and guacamole at Chipotle.

**Economic Earthquake**

Local economists have expressed concern over the sudden wage hike. Dr. Harold Pennypincher, professor of Economics at the University of Tulsa, warned, *""This could lead to inflation, job losses, and an increase in people who can finally afford to buy my textbook instead of pirating it.""*

Small business owners are equally apprehensive. Linda Cartwright, owner of ""Linda's Lattes,"" lamented, *""At $25 an hour, my baristas make more than I do. I might have to start charging $15 for a cup of coffee... oh wait, Starbucks already does that.""*

**Unexpected Consequences**

The wage increase has led to several unforeseen developments:

* **Fast-Food Frenzy**: Lines at local fast-food joints have stretched for blocks as former white-collar workers abandon their desks for fryers. *""I get to wear a uniform, listen to pop music, and make $25 an hour? Sign me up!""* exclaimed former accountant Joe Simmons.
* **Chicken Unionization**: In a surprising turn, poultry across Tulsa have begun organizing for better coop conditions, inspired by the human wage hike. *""Bawk bawk equal pay!""* clucked a spokesperson for the newly formed ""Feathered Friends United.""
* **Robots Revolt**: Automated kiosks at several establishments have reportedly short-circuited upon learning they are now the lowest-paid workers. One kiosk displayed the message, *""Error 404: Fair Wage Not Found.""*

**National Attention**

The federal government has taken notice, with President Taylor Swift tweeting, *""Tulsa's wage hike is a love story for the working class. Let's hope it doesn't end in bad blood.""*

Meanwhile, neighboring states have expressed concern over potential ""wage refugees"" crossing borders in search of higher pay. Texas Governor Chuck Norris has vowed to build a wall, stating, *""Not to keep people out, but to keep our own from leaving.""*

**The Road Ahead**

As Tulsa embarks on this unprecedented journey, residents are hopeful yet cautious. Local philosopher and Uber driver, Maya Jenkins, mused, *""Money can't buy happiness, but at $25 an hour, it can rent it for a while.""*

Only time will tell if Tulsa's bold move will serve as a beacon for economic reform or a cautionary tale of fiscal folly. In the meantime, citizens are advised to enjoy their newfound wealth responsibly—perhaps by finally fixing that leaky faucet or buying a second pair of shoes.

1kxi8ga,https://v.redd.it/s2257ufr6j3f1,Thoughts & Feedback,"Thought I'd share my worm farm configuration with the community for some feedback. As you can see I installed a heavy duty tarp for protection from direct sun & rain. The trees provide plenty of shade for that spot, but as hot & humid as the climate is here every bit helps. 

The red cup contains a mix of coffee grounds, ground oats and pulverized egg shells for topping the food with. The bowl contains a variety of frozen fruits and veggies. The bag is obviously shredded paper. And the little white thing in the black water dish is a digital hygrometer wrapped in a tea bag to keep things from crawling inside of it.

And the reddish-orange looking liquid is a mix of cayenne pepper and canola oil for the ant traps at the base. I found a suggestion to use canola oil (because it doesn't evaporate) and I added cayenne pepper after noticing something was emptying (I imagine drinking) the canola oil from only one of the ant traps. The tarp also helps keep the rain from flooding the oil out.

I gently squeezed some of the bedding to show that it's not too wet. It probably was a bit too wet a few weeks ago, so I've been letting it breathe and being cautious not to add too much moisture. My meter still shows the humidity being too high, but the ambient outdoor humidity is already in the 80’s most days.

Temps are kept in an ideal range by adding a frozen water around 11am every day. 

Maybe a few of these things will help someone else.

[DF54 / Bambino Plus],"*Just a little bit of background here first* \- I previously had a 1Zpresso JX-Pro connected to a Flair Power Tower (electrifies hand-grinders for those that aren't aware) and have been slow feeding in that setup for quite a while using a Cremaloop automatic slow feeder, and my results have been great and quite consistent so far. In order to save time when making multiple drinks, I decided to get a second grinder to be able to do 2 drinks at once (as the slow-feeding is what occupies around half the time per drink for me). But instead of the getting the same exact grinder setup, I decided to use this opportunity to get the other grinder I was considering earlier as an alternative (the DF54) to have a flat-burr grinder to experiment with as well. When it came time to do multiple drinks, I would simply dial that one in to match my current grinder setup. I ordered it, it arrived, I set it up, and all looked well so far so I decided to start working on dialing it in and trying to learn what is a good grind range and what kind of a difference each number adjustment makes. Upon my testing I made some discoveries that has me surprised and questioning some things (as I hadn't read any of these findings from others in my research of the DF54 so far).

Two part question here:

**Question 1**: ***Does anyone else that slow-feeds their DF54 (when making espresso) notice that they need to use a super fine grind size in order to hit their required yields? (I'm talking like something in the 0-7 range)***

*For context* \- I'm testing with a 23g of a medium/dark roast and needing 46g out in about 30 seconds (this is what I had dialed-in to work on this coffee in my other grinder setup). I experimented and started from grind size 15, 13, 11, 9, and went down to 5 and barely noticed a difference. All my shots overshot my needed 46g (somewhere like 49-51g) and came out in 20-21 seconds and were really nasty and sour (I was using a cheaper coffee for these tests but it still shouldn't taste like this). This kind of shocked me as I had read that this is a good espresso starting range for this model grinder and, considering I was barely noticing any difference even with such major changes in numbers, it had me thinking something was wrong with my grinder (for reference my JX-Pro has a range from 0-50 and no matter what coffee I used I was always making small adjustments in only the 11-15 range, something like 7 was already Turkish grind for me).

It wasn't until I went all the way down to grind size level ""1"" that I could finally get around 46.5g in 25 seconds. That seems pretty crazy for me to have to grind that low. For reference, I checked my true-zero point is somewhere like a -5 so you can add 5 to all those values I tested for the ""true"" grind size. But a true level ""6"" grind size still seems pretty crazy low just to finally see a difference in yield/time in a more acceptable range (and it still didn't hit my required 30 seconds). As it was still tasting quite sour (though definitely not as bad as earlier attempts), I decided to keep dialing it in closer to 30 seconds. Considering I didn't have much range left, I checked what level ""0"" grind size would do, and here I finally got 45.4g in 32 seconds. What a difference! This time it was a bit too slow and I overshot my time instead by a little bit, it was a bit bitter now but this is the best shot yet. Considering level 1 ended up with 25 seconds and level 0 was 32. I could go exactly half (level 0.5?) and I would probably be close to what I need but considering I have to adjust it so fine in between 2 numbers, it's going to be really hard to get this grind size exactly each time I need it. This, in result, has me with a second question now.

**Question 2**: ***When working within your espresso range (slow-feeding or not), does anyone else notice they have to make micro-fine adjustments in between numbers to hit their desired yield/time? Does anyone have issues setting that grind size again when they need to?***

Any tips, ideas, or info would be much appreciated.

*TLDR: Slow-feeding in the DF54 I noticed I have to use a super fine range for espresso when testing one coffee (grind size 0-1, my true-zero is around -5. Corrected for true-zero values should be something like a 5-6 then). I have a concern if going forward I will have to make microfine adjustments in between 2 numbers just to get my desired yield/time for different coffees and it's going to be hard to get back to the same grind size later each time.

1kxi6bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kxi6bl/the_birds_stopped_coming_during_the_storm/,The birds stopped coming during the storm. Something else came instead.,"At seventy two, Bernard’s life had its quiet routine.

He awoke at first light, got dressed, and walked through the rising birdsong to the clinic. He was usually the first one there and said hello to Mary, the heavyset nurse with the kind face who worked the early shift. After checking him in, Mary would lead him to the small room on the side where she gave him a plastic cup containing the mixture. She made sure to watch him drink the whole thing. He understood why.

He ate breakfast at the diner four streets away. He avoided the nearby restaurant, since both times he went, he recognized faces from the clinic. He then walked back to his house, taking the long way for the exercise if he felt up for it. At home, he made a second cup of coffee, which he sipped while reading the local newspaper, focusing on obituaries and science news while generally avoiding the headlines. These days, they were mostly about the floods.

After a light lunch, Bernard would either rest or walk to the library. And then, around 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon, his real day would start. He would put on his overcoat and hat and start the slow journey to his favorite park bench. It was slow not just because of the distance but because Bernard stopped at the bakery along the way. At this point, five years into the routine, the bakers knew him well enough to have a white paper bag ready when the entry chime announced the arrival of the old man in the tattered hat. Inside the bag were crumbs and crusts and old bagels — edible items that would otherwise get trashed.

And then, feed in hand, Bernard walked up the winding road past Meer Street until he reached the overlook. A few street lamps marked the spot. Under them were a trio of park benches, spaced apart. In front was a small break in the trees, giving a clear view of the far-off distance. Hills and fields and sky.

The birds were already there by the time Bernard showed up. Most were pigeons, but there were also robins and a few brave sparrows that occasionally fought the bigger birds for crumbs.

As soon as he sat on the bench, Bernard reached into the bag and deposited approximately a third of its contents on the ground. This caused light mayhem, which he loved, and once it settled, he spent the next hour or so slowly tossing them the rest of the food. He never spoke to the birds, believing that animals of different species have much more effective ways of connecting than human speech — food, for one. Sitting in quiet proximity, another. After the meal, once they’d all flown off, many into the branches of neighboring trees, Bernard rose from the bench and started the trek home.

Some people feel lonely. Especially old people near the end of their life with no partner, children, or friends they see regularly. This was not the case with Bernard. In his eighth decade, all his meaning and company came from the small winged things that filled his afternoons.

Bernard’s house, a two-room bungalow, was on a street at the top of a small hill located in a tiny Appalachian town named for the sixth US president. The town was half-empty when he moved in, mostly on account of the pill-shaped poison, which grabbed deep on lots of the folks, but also because of shifting topographies in the mountains. These, when paired with heavy rainfall, created intense flooding in areas not located on high ascents. Bernard, who paid his rent with the last of his savings and scant government checks, had no idea when he moved in how lucky his home’s elevation would be over the years.

Although not many would call pre-formed celestiantism with elements of interventional transcendence luck. Goes back to something deeper, earned.

On a late spring afternoon, Bernard made his way down the hill after feeding the birds. The sky was grey and the air had that early summer punch. As he turned on Meer, there was a commotion from a yard. Two men shouting at each other, but Bernard could hear them over the sump pump one ran into his home. Until there was a pause in the vacuum, when he deciphered, “*SKY’S FIXING TO SPLIT. FIGGER IT CAN’T HURT TO GET HER OFF GRID.”*

This was news to Bernard. When he reached his home, he checked that day’s paper. No news of an approaching hurricane. The forecast called for rain, but it didn’t sound pernicious. But the next afternoon at the library, he checked two different papers, which cautioned residents of his town to prepare for an upcoming four-to-five day squall.

One article was especially scary. It quoted a professor of ecology who said, “If the rainfall exceeds eighteen inches, it can be damaging to the point of washing this whole town away.” Another article spoke about how a flood of water in town would do little to cleanse the stain left by “the previous flood, of hillbilly heroin and chemical compounds, whose ravages are still felt.”

On his walk back from the birds that day, Bernard drank deep the pre-rainfall stain of the weather. The sky was crackling, the heavens an opening menace.

He did all he could to prepare on short notice: he picked up enough food to last him a week, hoisted up the storm windows, which he’d only ever done once before, and then called the clinic to see if it was possible to get a few temporary take-home doses. They said they couldn’t do that, which he understood, but the emergency mobile clinic, a fancy term for the ambulance in the parking lot, was operating, and could he please confirm his home address? The voice on the telephone told him to expect a visit at 10 am.

The first day of the storm was just as brazen as predicted. Rain pounded his window and roof nonstop, with a sound so loud it was legitimately distracting. 10 am came and went, but the emergency mobile clinic never showed. He called the clinic, but he couldn’t reach a human; it seemed they had closed on account of the weather, which made sense, but also not really, since just the day before he was assured his dose would be delivered. Distraction became the thing on account of his growing nausea, and an ache in his muscles he knew well from previous times. He tried reading, then watching TV, then pacing, then napping, but none of it took. At 4 in the afternoon, he thought of the birds. He hoped they were okay and not waiting out the storm in hunger.

The second day was more of the same. No emergency mobile clinic, and an increase in nausea. There were still muscle pains, and goosebumps broke out on his arms and neck that wouldn’t leave for a few hours. Bernard spent most of that day indoors listening to the rain and watching it from the window. He made a box of macaroni and cheese and spooned it into his mouth as the world outside took a wildly runny turn. He turned on his TV. He thought of the birds.

That night, Bernard had a strange dream. He was in something resembling a supermarket, wandering the aisles. Past the produce, a purple-and-green faced being appeared to him. Its skin rippled in scales and small triangles took over much of its face. Large wings clanked off its back, beating occasionally, keeping it aloft. It didn’t speak, just hovered in the air, looking down at the small man. And even though it didn’t communicate in any way other than its presence, Bernard, in his dream, understood.

When he awoke, he decided, torrential weather or not, he would make it there that day. All morning, in between shudders and mostly dry heaves, he played out his plan. He would wear his slick raincoat and hat. He would be careful on the dirt steps up to the benches, since there was no handrail and it was all likely mud at this point. He would wear the old pair of workboots he still had from those two years he helped clear sites. The distraction was helpful against his pangs of withdrawal. A few times, he vomited, shocked the clinic would leave him like this. He telephoned them, but got no answer, and tried the bakery, but it was the same. Which made sense: it seemed like a great day to keep things closed. Luckily, he found some stale crackers in the back of the cupboard and a frozen loaf of bread in the freezer, which he took out to thaw. By 3 in the afternoon, he was both physically ready — with the right clothes, boots, and feed — and physically bothered — by the muscles pangs, nausea, and increasing lightheadedness. Thankfully the vomit had passed.

Bernard walked slowly, his feet tracing familiar steps, although the world was anything but recognizable. The ground was slop; even the road looked liquid. The trees banged and waved in the wind, broken limbs littered his path. He couldn’t see the sky or two feet in front of him, everything relegated to a grey-blue curtain of moving wet. His pants from the knee down were soaked within minutes, although his feet, torso, and head stayed toasty, as did the feed he had placed in three plastic bags, one in the other in the other.

Eventually, he reached the ascent that led to the lookout where he met with his birds. It took him nearly ten minutes to walk up the nine or so steps, which would usually take him all of thirty seconds. But he got up there eventually and saw the bench he sat on was still there. Sopping, but there. He couldn’t see the view, obviously, but it was clear that there was no bird anywhere in the vicinity. Of course not — was he an idiot? It was storming so bad, nothing was out, let alone the pigeons and sparrows he’d grown to rely on, even love.

Still, the old man took his seat on the bench, making sure to put the back of his raincoat under his butt so it wouldn’t get soaked. He sat there, feeling the rain pound his body until it gave way to the pounding of his skull and his being, wrung out in the harsh indifference of withdrawal. It was awful, hard, and the extremity of the outdoors offered little distraction. For a good few minutes, Bernard just sat there, suffering. It was such that he didn’t think he could make the return trip, not without tremendous effort. Maybe this was it. He put the bag of bird food on the bench beside him and lowered his stinging, cascading head into his hands.

For a few minutes he stayed like this, unsure of himself or how to chop through this pain.

And then, it was like there was a pause in the weather. Except that wasn’t true — the view from the bench was still obscured by the pouring, but it seemed like the rain had lessened around him. There was a fluttering to his right as a large thing settled. And then another to his left, and then a few more.

Bernard, head still lowered, turned, but only partially. The things beside him were not birds. This he could tell just by their presence, and even though in his dream he had seen a green-and-purple face, in this context, *in the reality of the bizarre moment*, he knew (*how? how did he know?*) that to look directly at the things near him would be like looking directly at the sun, but with a quicker snuff out.

Bernard sat on that bench, feeling the pause in the rain and the lightness (*no, that wasn’t the word, but the real word for the feeling didn’t exist, nor could it be found in a phrase or description or any method of communication)* as more and more of the winged things settled down all around him. They kept fluttering down — even though Bernard kept his head to the ground, it was impossible not to feel their arrival. Must have been a dozen of them, maybe more, all gathered silently near the old man who had made a habit of feeding the birds that tended to congregate here in better weather.

Time passed, slowly, but it was enough just to be near them. Plus, it was work to keep his focus on not looking, and the pain in his head was still a snare, the ache in his muscles going on like a runaway. Only… he opened his eyes after a long pause. He could feel the rain falling on him. He turned his head slightly. The thing to the right of him was gone. He turned to the left, and then looked behind him. They were all gone — which he knew because the pause in the rain was, too. But that wasn’t it — all the food in the plastic bags had vanished. This made Bernard smile more than anything.

Until he stood up. Because when he did, it was with a straighter back than he had in decades. His head felt surprisingly clear and his muscles felt spry like he was forty again. He walked back to his house through the rain in increasing steps of disbelief; not only were the pangs of withdrawal gone, gone entirely, but he couldn’t remember a time in his life when he felt better. It was uncanny, but no complaints.

The next morning, the fourth and supposed last day of the rainy ambush, the emergency mobile clinic showed up in front of his house just after 10 am.

Bernard went out to meet them. He smiled, waving broadly, and told them there was no need. They looked at him like he was nuts, but peeled off. By late afternoon, the rain had stopped, and although the world was drenched and turned to sloggy mud all over, he walked his boots back to the bench, holding a small bag of pretzels he picked up at the gas station’s On-the-Go Mart. He was glad to see it open again.

And when Bernard sat on that bench and a few birds came over to eat his offerings, he felt overjoyed, knowing something about them, something about himself that he doubted he could ever express, because how could you express that which you don’t understand? — but it was alright, it was enough just to feel.

Hours later, he walked home in the falling birdsong.
