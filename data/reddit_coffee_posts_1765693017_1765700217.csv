If I set my grinder to a grind setting of a certain value, say 18 - will that produce ground coffee of a size of ""18"" no matter what bean I put in or is the 18 more like a kind of multiplicator in the sense that if I use smaller coffee beans the output will be smaller too?

The problem at hand is that I'll be getting a new espresso setup and my mom and I drink very different coffee but will be both using the setup including the same grinder. 
Her beans are much darker than mine, so they have a different size.

1pm8tqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1pm8tqk/christmas_break_up/,Christmas break up,I was dating my ex since October of last year when we were both new to high school and bonded over classes and because we had the same music taste. We were huge Christmas fans and last year over break watched as many movies as we can. I always fell asleep first and I never knew what he did after I was asleep but I’d wake up tucked in and him with something to eat or at least a coffee from Starbucks. This year I was hoping to do the same thing except with more movies and more nights I literally stayed up all night getting my favorite Christmas movies and buying things to wear as we watched them. I texted him trying to get a response and for once in our relationship he left me on read for 24 hours he read it immediately and after a day he sends a “wyd” and like after that I was excited to get a response and I kinda spammed him talking about the list I made and stuff. Then a friend of me said she saw him with a different girl. This guy had zero sisters but I guessed it was a cousin at least I hoped. After about 2 days I heard the same thing but this time I heard her name and it wasn’t anyone he was related to! He was cheating on me right before my favorite holiday!! I don’t know what to do and now I feel stupid for focusing on a holiday and not being a better GF I need help on what I could have done to stop this from happening again or what I could have looked for. ,1,1765699519.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1pm8tal,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1pm8tal/the_weirdest_part_about_getting_sober_realizing_i/,The weirdest part about getting sober? Realizing I was using alcohol to feel less alone - and it made me MORE isolated,"I'm 25. Single. No close friends. For the longest time I thought my problem was just... me. Like I'm inherently unlikable or socially broken or something. Turns out I'd spent the last 4-5 years unknowingly building a wall between myself and everyone else. The wall was made of alcohol.

College me: Alcohol made socializing easier. I felt funnier, more confident, less awkward. Everyone drinks, right?

Now me: I literally couldn't hang out with people without drinking. Coffee dates gave me anxiety. But happy hour? I'm there. Eventually people stopped inviting me places because I'd only show up if alcohol was involved. Declined brunches, skipped game nights, bailed on anything sober. But bar nights? Never missed one.

Two months ago I'm sitting in my apartment, drinking alone (again), scrolling through Instagram watching everyone else living their lives. And it hits me - I have nobody to text. Nobody to call. I'm completely alone. But here's the fucked up part: I'd done this to myself. Every friendship I could've built? Sabotaged because I was always drunk or hungover or flaky. Every social skill I should've developed in my 20s? Didn't, because alcohol did the heavy lifting. Every real connection? Replaced with surface-level bar buddies who I only saw when we were both drinking. I found an outpatient program for young professionals. Been going for about 6 weeks now.

Here's what nobody tells you about getting sober: the loneliness gets WORSE before it gets better. Suddenly you're not going to bars. You're turning down invites because ""grabbing drinks"" is literally the only way you know how to socialize. You're realizing most of your ""friendships"" were just drinking buddies who don't actually know you. It's brutal.

But also: for the first time in years, I'm actually \*present\* when I'm with people. I'm not foggy or checking out or planning my next drink. I joined a climbing gym (because therapy said I needed sober hobbies, eye roll). Met a few people. Had an actual conversation. Remembered their names the next day. Baby steps.

Why I'm posting this: If you're reading this sub because you feel isolated and alone - check your coping mechanisms. I spent YEARS thinking I was lonely because something was wrong with me. Turns out I was lonely because I'd replaced human connection with a substance that literally makes you more isolated over time.

Not saying this is everyone's situation. But if you're thinking ""huh, I do drink alone a lot"" or ""I only feel comfortable socializing when I'm buzzed"" - maybe look into that. Loneliness sucks. But self-inflicted loneliness hits different.

Anyway. If anyone's going through something similar, you're not alone in being alone. Which is weirdly comforting.",1,1765699467.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

He woke in the middle of the night and saw Kiko completely focused on the screen. It showed some house being attacked, and it seemed like a bad action movie. But the more he saw, the more real it became. She was focused entirely on one guy who was surrendering to the attackers in the corner of the video.  He sat up, simply handed him a cup of coffee, and turned her attention back to the screen.

“I guess you found the traitor?”

“I found three potentials, but Cheng is the strongest candidate. They talk to him but don’t shoot him. Just rough him up a little, and they get take a keycard from him.”

“damn, that looks brutal. Movies always make it look so smooth.” He said and she chuckled.

“Movies and reality are two very different things. If they really showed what some of those bastards do to each other, then nobody would believe it. That’s why I wanted to be a cop, I accidentally saw my dad interviewing a guy. Gave me nightmares for weeks. One of my uncles was always so nice with me; he had three daughters that I used to hang with, and he sold boys and girls to the highest bidder. And I don’t mean droids, I mean the real thing to sick people.”

Peter just looked at her, shocked as she spoke.

“And they didn’t even care, for them it was cargo, goods to be sold. They even used to buy DNA from famous people to make clones for sale to the highest bidder. Well, that got shot down like twenty years ago, and they still bitch about it.  So I had a moment of clarity. I’m not like them. I wanted out, and not just out, I want to burn this whole family to the ground. And then it turned out to be those same bastards who ended up protecting me when the shit hit the fan. I was family after all.”

She turned to him, and she had a strange glow in her eyes. “So I’ll be completely honest with you because you deserve it. I need to get back.  I need to get back and mess up both those damn families so much that they break, and my plan was to seduce you to get me back.  And then you're such a fucking idiot that I’m falling for you. Why couldn’t you just be an asshole smuggler? Somebody I could easily stab in the back and use to get my revenge.”

He watched her as she rambled out her confession, not saying anything.

“I don’t even know what to do with you. You're just not what I need now, and still you're just what I always needed. Does that make sense?” She asked.

“I don’t know, I know I would do the same to get out of here. And I panicked when I saw you. I had no idea what to do, hell, I was close to just leaving you there. I’m glad I didn’t.”

“I’m glad you didn’t.” She moved over to him. “I’m not going to stab you in the back, you're going to be the one who got away.”

“Why did you get away?”

“Because I don’t even know if I’m going to survive my little revenge quest, and I don’t want to drag you down with me.”

“You think I’m going to watch you go and get yourself killed? I could not help my wife when she had to face death alone, and I'm not going to let you face it alone.”

She looked at him, and he could see her eyes get watery as she wiped away tears. “Stop being such a damn good guy. You’re a smuggler and bad guy, criminal.”

“I was supposed to be a deep space miner, the smuggling  wasn’t supposed to be our thing.”

“Shut up,” she whispered as she pushed him down in the bed.

After breakfast, he disconnected one of the scooters after he had looked at the diagnostic.

“Okay, here is a treat for you. There is an island about a hundred kilometers west of here.  With one bike, I can fly at 25 km per hour. It should take me four, maybe five hours. I have put the location on your GPS, so now you can play along a little. You don’t need the spacesuit either; you can put on the scoot suit, but I would recommend keeping the helmet so we can talk.”

She js just looked at him then grinned as she vanished inside to change. He smiled as he looked after her. Having her as a fast-moving scout would be smart too, and she would be happy. When she came out, he stood up and whistled. She was wearing a skintight red biker suit and only a visor and black facemask instead of a helmet.

“No need for a helmet. The visor is connected to the scooter's interface. So do you like it?” She turned slowly for him to see, and he took his time admiring her.

“You’re doing this on purpose!”

“Of course. My boyfriend needs to know what he is working so hard for.”

“I already know, but it's nice to be reminded.” He said as he picked her up and put her on the bike. “You do know how to drive these bikes, right?”

“Yes, Daddy!” Sahe lowered her mask and kissed him. “For good luck!”

Then she started the scooter, and it vanished like a rocket into the sky as he heard her laugh delightedly on the coms. He went inside and changed, then he was about to grab the helmet when he saw she had left out a vizor and mask for him, so he changed, and just as he was about to leave, he saw his gun belt and grabbed it, he checked the weapon then grabbed one of the rifles and went outside,  and started the slow rise upwards to his chosen cruise height and started the long trek, Kiko was really testing the limits of the scooter.  She came up next to him, trying to sneak up on him but he had seen her on the radar the whole time.

“damn, this is such a great bike, you have to try it later. I mean, I can do the carriage run next.”

“I’m good, you have fun and keep an eye out for… wait…  There is something inbound.” He looked at his screen, and she looked down and simply nodded and moved towards it. Whatever it was, it was big and moved fast. It was clocked at 45 km and hour.

1pm8sn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIAssisted/comments/1pm8sn9/do_your_ai_videos_look_too_ai_how_to_fix_it_in/,Do your AI videos look too AI? How to fix it in simple steps?,"If your viewers say videos feel uncanny or robotic, it’s often because they’re too polished. AI can create flawless visuals and audio, but human audiences often prefer a touch of rawness. For example, a perfectly lighting, perfect delivery, perfect posture actor actually breaks trust to fix too AI vibes. Humans are not perfect. And when something looks too smooth, our brains instantly feel something is off.

**Here’s how to fix that and make your AI videos feel more natural and human:**

1. **Add small imperfections (this is the biggest fix)**: Real people blink at different speeds, stumble on words, smile unevenly, or shift their posture. AI avatars don’t naturally do this unless you guide them.

**Try adding:** A tiny pause, a small laugh or breath, slightly uneven expressions, a casual sip of coffee or glance away

These micro-imperfections make the video feel alive instead of robotic.

**2. Use a casual script, not a perfect paragraph**: AI loves writing clean, polished sentences. But real people talk messier.

**Try instead:**

* Contractions (“I’m”, “we’re”, “don’t”)
* Filler words (“you know”, “like”, “honestly”)
* Short, simple lines
* Real-life phrases, not corporate language

When the script sounds human, the whole video feels human. People will enjoy watching. 

**3. Keep the visuals simple and relatable:** 

Over-edited videos scream AI-generated. Instead of flashy transitions, stick to Quick cuts, simple captions, and natural-looking backgrounds (Always avoid being too fancy), minimal effect.

**Make sure:** Your goal is to make it feel like someone casually recorded a message, not a perfect studio production.

**4. Fix the voice: tone matters more than the avatar.** Even if your avatar looks great, the video will feel fake if the voice is flat.

**Look for voices that**: Have natural pacing, include breaths, have emotional variation, don’t sound too sharp or synthetic. If possible, slightly adjust pitch, speed, and pauses, tiny tweaks can completely change believability.

**5. Show real-life context:** One mistake people make is keeping everything AI-clean.

**Instead, try adding:**

* Screenshots of real reviews
* Background noise (light ambience)

This blend instantly boosts trust. 

**6. Don’t make avatars do emotionally heavy acting:** AI is still struggling with:

* Crying
* Emotional storytelling
* Highly personal testimonials

By adding the following points to the video creation, you close the authenticity gap. In other words, make your digital human look slightly imperfect so viewers’ brains relax. This way, your audience stops analyzing and starts engaging. 

**The result**: an AI video that feels surprisingly real, not 90’s video game.

What about you? Have you run into the too AI problem with your videos? What tricks or small changes helped your content feel more natural?

Pogledali smo se kad je ušao, potom je prošao iza mojih ledja pa sam nesvesno okrenula glavu u levo, on stoji tu odmah pored, čeka da se gužva raskloni da prodje i gledamo se pravo u oči. Predivan pogled i osmeh- nisam dugo dozivela ovako lepo prirodno i spontano, kad deluje da je vreme stalo, a svaki zvuk se mutirao. 

Seo je u drugi delo restorana, udaljeno al prekoputa mene i gledali smo se kroz ljude. Ne znam ništa o čoveku osim da je imao tamno zeleni duks, crn kaput, tamnu kosu, lepu visinu i tqmne oči i specifič zeleni, kockasti, kožni ranac, u tridesetim godinama. 

Imala sam zelju da se upoznamo al bila je gužva, ja za punim stolom i nekako se nije namestilo. Gledali smo se dok ide ka šanku da plati..Otišao je malo pre nas i samo imam ovu sliku kako odlazi(aaaavaj kakva metafora života). 

Nade su nikakve al romantične duše će razumeti. Dakle, kako da ga nadjem? Na Instagramu ovaj restoran ima 12000 pratilaca, al kopati po njima je bacanje novčića u bunar. Da li je ovo samo jedna lekcija da treba dati jasan znak i ubuduće biti hrabriji? Jeste li imali slične situacije? Verujete li u romantična upoznavanja uživo? 

Moja lekcija je da treba manje mozgati, više reagovati na prvu. We are all going to die👀☀️

1pm8le9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pm8le9/strange_v60_zp6_special/,Strange V60 + ZP6 special,"Hello, I've been digging this rabbit hole for about a year, starting with some crappy ceramic grinder and espresso type of beans. Later progressing to Kingrinder P2 and some entry level specialty beans. Few weeks ago I treated myself with ZP6 special and first better bag of beans - Panettone from DAK. 

Since I got the grinder I'm trying to be consistent with just one recipe - James Hoffman's 1 cup recipe as I thought it would fit the ZP6 as I can grind finer. I'm always using 18:300. From what I saw on reddit/internet/youtube it seems that there are rarely people grinding with the ZP6 on lower settings than 4. Usually they're around 5. This is where my confusion is coming from. I've tried several times these settings 4 all the way to 6 and the coffee never turned well so I tried going finer and finer. Where I found some success was 3.5 and going finer I was getting even better results and for the first time in this hobby I felt like I made a good cup at home. Today I tried 2.8 and this was the first time where I noticed some kind of bitterness - possible sign of channeling. However the coffee once again turned good overall and the taste the flavor is even more pronounced maybe too much acidic. I'm using hario bleached 02 papers with plastic v60 and total time was still 2:45. Also I dont't have a goose neck kettle and pour over a teaspoon using 90°C water.

I know that as far as I like the coffee there is nothing wrong with it. I'm just curious if there's someone with similar experience and maybe can share some tips. Also I found this chart which would make my settings look totally OK but again nothing similar from the community.

1pm8l3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/1pm8l3t/godslayer_31_infiltration/,Godslayer - 31: Infiltration,"Luna watched as the technicians headed over to her ship, removing the drone and set to work on quarantining it. She didn’t linger for long. The Platinum Future was big and she wasn’t entirely sure where to go. Cluelessly, she just picked a direction. With her stolen flight coveralls, nobody gave her a second glance and she walked through the Platinum Future as if she was meant to be there.

   “I’m out of the hangar,” She said into her Tac Band. “Where do I go next?”

   *“I need a port. Some way to access the station's systems.”* Tetra replied. *“The sooner the better. I don’t like being in here…”*

   “Yeah, well suck it up. What kind of port am I looking for?”

   *“Most computers would have access. Just find one and plug me in.”*

Luna nodded as she stepped into an elevator, heading into the central atrium of the Platinum Future. She found herself pausing the moment she saw it, allowing herself to take in the sheer scale of this place. The station was massive, stretching up hundreds of storeys toward a ceiling that was obscured by a bright, shining light. Just the simple act of looking up gave her vertigo. There was real grass in some sections of the atrium floor, with real trees and real flowerbeds. Stone paths wound through them, creating what was functionally a public park. 

   “This place is massive…” She said quietly. “Any advice on where I can actually find a computer?” She asked.

   *“Do I gotta do everything for you?”*

   “Well I doubt there’s just a bunch of unsecured computers just sitting there waiting for me to plug you in!”

   *“57th floor. Section 12. Apartment 42.”*

Luna frowned.

   “What’s there?”

   *“An unsecured computer just sitting there, waiting for you to plug me in.”*

She made her way across the atrium, toward an elevator. It rose up, higher and higher toward the 57th floor. Once the elevator stopped, she stepped off. The atrium was far below her now, although she could see it over the railing as she made her way past countless halls until she found the one marked *Sector 12*. She stared down the brightly lit hallway before starting down it.

   “So how do I even get into apartment 42 anyway?” she asked.

   *“You use me. Assuming they haven’t cleared it out yet… which is unlikely, I should still have access.”*

She could see it up ahead and after making sure she was unobserved, she pressed her Tac Band to the electronic lock. The door clicked and slid open. She quickly disappeared inside.

The apartment was immaculately clean, with a well used kitchen and two modest bedrooms. The decor was sunny and warm. Looking around, Luna spotted pictures of Vi and Victor up on the walls… this had to be their place.

   *“Victor gave Freya access,”* Tetra explained. *“I’ve got a backup of the files she kept on her Tac Band, so that means I have access.”*

   “That’s convenient,” Luna said. 

   *“Life is convenient when you back up your data, isn’t it?”* Tetra asked.

She spotted a tablet computer on a coffee table and picked it up before running a cable from her Tac Band to the tablet. A pixelated shark logo that she had become all too familiar with swam onto the screen.

   “Can you get access through here?” She asked.

   *“It’s connected to the system. I should be able to try,”* Tetra said. *“But it’s going to take me a while before I can do much. There’s a lot more safeguards in the network here and the administrators are probably on high alert. There’s a very real chance I’ll get deleted as soon as I start-”*

The tablet screen went dark, before the a notification appeared on the screen.



**Malware detected.**

**This device has been locked to prevent the spread of dangerous malware. Please contact an administrator.**



   “Tetra?” Luna asked. 

   *“Still here.”* The voice on her Tac Band replied. *“What, you thought I didn’t keep a backup of myself on here? Come on!”*

   “Right…” Luna said. “So what now?”

   *“We try again. Fortunately, I managed to grab a few things before they deleted me. Remember how you said: ‘*Well I doubt there’s just a bunch of unsecured computers just sitting there waiting for me to plug you in!’”

She played back Luna’s own voice for the quote.

  
   *“Well it just so happens that there’s a small office complex on the 84th floor. Currently vacant. The employees are scheduled to be attending a seminar on the 87th floor. They won’t be back for another two hours. I can unlock the doors for you. You just need to put me on as many computers as possible.”*

   “Can I ask why?”

   *“The security systems can only protect against so much. If enough copies of me try to get past them at once, it may overload them.”*

Luna nodded and turned to leave the apartment, heading back for the elevator.

   *“I have some more good news,”* Tetra said. *“I found Victor.”*

Her eyes widened.

   “Wait, seriously? Where?”

   *“Still on AF-1. Underwater but intact. He and Noah are both alive. I’ve sent all the still functioning drones I’ve got down there to try and help him get his ship up and running. ETA is about one hour.”*

   “That fast?” 

   *“I’ve got like 50 drones down there and all the spare parts I could possibly need. So yes, that fast.”* 

   *“Thank the Gods for that too…”* Victor said through the comms. *“Whatever’s left of them, at least. We’re already behind the clock as it is. I can’t imagine the Platinum Future will be sticking around much longer.”*

   “Victor…” Luna said, before allowing herself a relived laugh. She didn’t think she’d ever been so happy to hear another person's voice before. She paused for a moment, before continuing down the hall.

   *“Still kicking,”* Victor said.

   *“I am also still kicking!”* Noah chimed in.

   “Good to hear. I was starting to worry I’d be doing this all alone.”

   *“You kinda are… at least until I can get in their systems,”* Tetra said. *“Even when the ship is repaired, there’s no way in hell they’re getting on board. Not without me pulling a whole lot of bullshit.”*

   “Right, well you can do that once I make it to those computers, right?” Luna asked. She’d reached the end of the hall and was heading back toward the elevator. 

   *“Bingo,”* Tetra said.

Luna stepped into the elevator and headed up toward the 87th floor. Through the window, she could see the atrium far below her. The sheer size of it still wowed her.

   “Where do I go once I make it to the floor?” She asked.

   *“Section 9. Unit 4.”*

As the doors opened, she made her way there. She knew what she was looking for this time, and made her way there a little faster. It didn’t take her long to find the door she was looking for and she pressed her Tac Band to the scanner. As expected, the doors opened and she let herself in.

The office was mostly empty… mostly.

A single receptionist sat behind a desk on the other side of the doors and smiled up at Luna as she entered.

   “I’m sorry, our office staff is currently out!” She said in a chipper, all too friendly tone. Luna paused, sizing her up. The mystery woman did the same, taking note of her dirty pilot flight suit.

   “I… apologize, are you in the wrong unit? This is the shipping logistics office.”

Luna tried to think of something to say. She failed and instead just punched the other woman in the face. She hit the ground with a startled cry, and slipped into unconsciousness. Luna grabbed her under the arms and dragged her away from her desk before finding a storage closet to lock her in. 

The office proper was reasonably large, with several computers sitting vacant. Luna had her work cut out for her. She connected her Tac Band to the first one, and moments later saw all of the screens start to change. Tetra’s shark icon swam onscreen.

   *“Oh yeah! That’s what I’m talking about!”* Tetra cheered. *“I can use this!”*

   “That was fast…” Luna said.

   *“These computers are all connected via an intranet. I can upload myself onto all this and more simultaneously!”*

   “Will it be enough?” Luna asked.

   *“Give me a few minutes and we’re gonna find out…”* 



\*\*\*



Tetra could feel herself on all of the computers… although she wasn’t satisfied just yet. She wasn’t ready. She thought for a moment, allowing herself to quietly spread to whatever she knew she could touch without the ship’s security system flagging her. It took her approximately 0.002 seconds to come up with an idea.

She pulled a file - a random file, and compressed it. Then she compressed that compressed file, and compressed that compressed file, and compressed it again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again. She bundled compressed files together, compressed them again. Over, and over, and over again. Then when she was finally satisfied, she copied the final compressed file to everywhere else she had access to, ensuring they all had the same file, compressed over and over again.

Finally she made her move. All at once, from hundreds of different computers, she opened up access to the ship's main server and uploaded her compressed file.

She uploaded her compressed file 392 times. All at once.

The system tried to scan them, found more compressed files. More, and more, and more. More than it could handle. It slowed down. There was too much. Too much to scan. Tetra started uploading herself next. Ten copies at a time. The system tried to scan her. It tried to delete her, but it just didn’t have the bandwidth. 

The system crashed. It would need time to reboot. Minutes. It might as well have been centuries. More than enough time for her to do what she needed.



\*\*\*



   ***“I’m back, baby!”***

The voice boomed through a localized intercom, and Luna looked up.

   “It worked?” She asked. 

   ***“Mostly. The system here is a lot bigger. More compartmentalized. I don’t have full control… yet.”***

   “Good enough,” Luna said. “Tell me you’ve got something good for me.”

   ***“Lots,”*** Tetra said. ***“Who do you want first?”***



\*\*\*



Vi drifted in and out of slumber. She could see a few scientists around her, monitoring her virals, taking blood samples. Poking and prodding her like a specimen… but she was too weak to do much about it.

She tried to shift. Tried to return to her natural state. Her body wouldn’t respond. Her wings tried to move. They were too sluggish.

   “We should give her another dose,” one of the scientists said. “Looks like she’s waking up again.”

   “You sure? We don’t want to overdo it… it could kill her.”

   “Bullshit. These things are durable. I’m upping the dosage. Better safe than sorry.”

He tapped away at his tablet computer, before frowning.

   “What is it?” his colleague asked.

   “The computer isn’t responding…” the first one said. “What the hell?” He tapped it again and again, growing more and more frustrated.

Suddenly the lights went out. Vi could hear a chorus of confused and panicked voices. People asking what was going on.

   “It’s a power surge, just a power surge, give it a minute!” one of the scientists in front of her insisted. A moment later, some of the lights above them flickered back to life as the auxiliary power kicked in.

   “See?” The scientist asked. “It’s fine!”

   ***“Warning! Power failure in section 4. Auxiliary power initiated.”*** A voice said over the intercom. Vi recognized that voice…

   ***“Alert. Rolling brownouts may be expected when convenient or funny. Please be advised that due to the questionable decision to connect everything to the network, effective immediately everyone on this ship is now my bitch.”***

The scientist looked up.

   “What the hell…?” he asked under his breath. He looked over to see the doors to the lab opening, before the voice on the intercom spoke again.

   ***“Releasing Dragon. Have a nice day.”***

There was a series of clicks as the locks securing the form fitting cage around Vi opened. She tried to move. This time, the cage budged. As her body twisted, the cage fell away around her. Vi reared up, spreading her wings as she stretched. The room around her was too small to fly in, but she could still crawl and slither. She was still groggy, but she still had it in her to let loose a deafening roar, which filled the room and deafened all those in her presence.

They started to run, and Vi followed.

1pm8iqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1pm8iqx/confession_time/,Confession time,"I was born 15 years post WW2, both my parents smoked my entire youth. In the car, at home, there was no thought on second hand smoke so myself and siblings were constantly exposed. TV shows like Beverly Hillbillies, Perry Mason,  they all promoted smoking and Winston's was a major sponsor of those shows. At 17 I got my first real job and I worked in a smallish office were 3 employees all smoked, I was the only non smoker or so I thought.  Usually the office was filled with blue haze of second hand smoke, my clothes smelled, my throat often burned but I never gave it a thought, other than it was gross and I hated looking at full ashtrays. In the mid 80s smoking rooms were setup and office staff had to go there to smoke. The air in the office was now free of smoke and I was still a non smoker.

  
My girlfriends' parents were also smokers but my girlfriend didn't smoke but she had tried it. One day in June, 1984 she talked me into buying a pack of cigarettes, telling me I'd enjoy it. Stupidist mistake I ever made as exposure to second hand smoke had caused me to become addicted and I never knew it, until it was too late. A pack a week at first, telling myself I could quit anytime. I enjoyed it, it satisfied the need that was created by 20 ish years of second hand smoke. I was young, in love and seduced by a craving I never realised I had.

Eventually my girlfriend became my wife and smoking was now a part of my life. I tried many times to quit but could never break the cycle. In 2018 cannibus was legalised in Canada. I tried it and found mixing it with tobacco gave me a better rush and what started as friday night fun quickly moved to weekends and then weeknights. It relaxed me, helped me sleep, I liked the feeling it offered.

  
About 6 weeks ago, I don't know what happened but cannibus lost all appeal to me. I didn't consciously decide to stop, i just stopped, no desire, no need to go outside, no nothing, just stopped all cannibus. I've got several prerolls in a container in my sock drawer and there they sit. I only remember them occasionally and there is absolutely no draw to consume them. I keep them as a safety net, knowing I have them in case I ever need them again. However, I know I'm done with them. 2 weeks later I'm in the garage smoking a cigarette as usual, I head off to bed shortly after. The next morning, a Saturday, I made a coffee, took the pack of cigarettes and saw 4 remaining. I looked at them and had zero desire to light up. That pack with 4 remaining is still in the drawer, next to the cannibus and there they sit, undesired, not temping me and there they will continue to sit.

I do not understand what happened. One day I'm consuming cannibus and cigarettes, pack a day user. Then a switch was thrown and something changed, no desire to smoke, no cravings, no headaches, just shitty sleep for the first few weeks. One of my worst vices was watching youtube videos while smoking and drinking coffee. It wouldn't be unusual to smoke 4 or 5 cigarettes over the course of a couple hours. I still watch youtube videos and drink coffee but smoking is done and I don't miss it at all.

I've tried several times to quit and every time I've failed. This time I wasn't even trying, it just happened and I've never been more content with myself. I think I've slayed something because I know I will never smoke again, ever. My mind is clear, I understand that if a craving should come I can handle it but more importantly I know how it feels to smoke versus not smoke and I choose not smoking. Perhaps it was just time to quit, I now think of smoking as a boring waste of time that never did me one favour. It's been over a month and I have been keeping my not smoking secret from my wife and family. No one knows I've done this and I don't plan to make a big deal of it. One day I suppose I'll share but in the meantime I'm going to enjoy my secret and count the thousands of saved dollars. I never thought I'd quit like this, I never thought I could quit. I hated smoking and despised how it controlled me. I don't have the smoke free time that many of you do but I cannot forsee a time when the seduction of smoking will ever appeal to me again. 

It's a long read but I've read pretty much all the comments in this sub, trying to figure out what and why this happened the way it did. It's crazy and I don't understand it, smoking one day, done the next. I applaud everyone trying to quit or who has quit, I love how free I now feel. ",1,1765698351.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False
1pm8ipw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_sade_pinn/comments/1pm8ipw/militado_ml20_review_and_opinions_from_real_women/,Militado Ml-20 review and opinions from REAL WOMEN.,"I bought this watch with my own money as a birthday present to myself. I promised myself I would buy another watch only after saving enough to buy an apartment, so wish me luck... I am not affiliated with any brand, store, reviewer, or individual. I have no association with absolutely anyone. (Except my gf, my family and friends, none of them are willing to give me any money) 

Here is the review. Read carefully, I put some effort into it.

So, the Militado ML-20 arrived at my place yesterday. I usually wear watches with a more vintage look, so I wanted something more modern this time. Something not shiny and not black. I chose a sand blasted watch because I don’t sell my watches, and I expect this kind of finish to age and patina in an interesting way over time.

My main options were Engelmann, Steelflier, and Militado.

The Engelmann looks like the premium option, but it’s not in stock and hasn’t been released yet. The Steelflier was too big for me, and the bracelet didn’t really match the watch. It also lacks solid end links. The movement was another important factor. I wanted something different from the NH35. My understanding is that Engelmann plans to use a Miyota 9-series movement, so I’m fairly sure I’ll buy one in the future, hopefully not a Sinn U50 homage, but something more original when they release a model that actually interests me.

The Militado ML-20 uses the controversial PT5000 movement. Controversial because some people claim it can be damaged by hand-winding, and there are reports of units arriving dead on arrival.

My watch arrived in perfect working order, and I simply won’t hand-wind it. If the movement gives me problems in the future, I’ll update this post.

The watch looks very good overall, but it’s not perfect. I have two main complaints. First, the bezel is slightly misaligned. Not terribly, but noticeable if you’re a perfectionist. If you care a lot about alignment, this is something to consider. Second, the outer bezel construction is made of two pieces. The original Sinn U50 uses a single-piece bezel, and both Steelflier and Engelmann kept that design choice. Militado uses an insert instead. Also, the red markers on the bezel don’t exactly match the red on the hands. The shade is different. Not a big deal, but it’s there.

That said, the bezel action itself is very good and produces a very satisfying sound.

The bracelet doesn’t have on-the-fly micro-adjustment, which is disappointing. Phorcydes offers a watch at a similar price with that feature, so this feels like a missed opportunity.

That said, the bracelet was easy to size, and the five micro-adjustment holes in the clasp helped me get a good, though not perfect, fit.

The lume is good and well matched. It won’t bother you. There is a very slight difference between the lume color on the hands and the markers, but it’s minimal and basically irrelevant. This is normal for watches under the four-figure range. The dial is clean. I checked it with a jeweler’s loupe and found no debris.

The date window isn’t matte, and the font is different from the rest of the dial. I thought this would bother me before buying the watch, but in reality, I kind of like it.

The watch has an interesting anti-fingerprint coating that keeps it looking clean most of the time. The crystal is sapphire, very clear, and appears to have a strong anti-reflective coating.

The screw-down crown action is good when setting the date and time, but the angle of the crown makes it genuinely hard to screw back in. When I say hard, I mean it. I adjusted the watch at a coffee shop and definitely looked ridiculous trying to get the crown seated properly.

As a final, completely unscientific note, my girlfriend preferred the Phorcydes PH-2, while my sister liked the Militado better. My girlfriend is a designer and a self-described hippie, my sister is an architect and a snob. My mother said that watches are a waste of money; she is a teacher, so she doesn’t know anything about watches or money.",1,1765698348.0,u_sade_pinn,0,1.0,False

I met a guy on a friends making app (He is Korean, I'm German and we both live in Korea).

December 8

We matched on an app and decided to meet on the same day. It was framed as a friendly meeting, not an official date. He asked me to get coffee, so we went to a café first. We talked a lot, laughed, and quickly realized we had many things in common and were each other’s type. During coffee, he already asked if I’d like to meet again on December 10.
After that, we went for dinner and had a few drinks (but stayed sober). While eating, he suddenly touched my hand and told me I was pretty.
Later, we went to a karaoke room. While I was singing one song, he stood behind me, touched my hair, and smiled at me.
When we went outside, he looked disappointed and said he didn’t want the evening to end. We took photos together in a photo booth and went for a walk. While walking, he put his hand into my jacket pocket and held my hand. He mentioned that most places on that street were either for couples or restaurants, so I jokingly said, “Shall we pretend to be a couple?” He liked the idea.
The connection felt really good, easy conversation, lots in common, good chemistry. He gave me compliments and thanked me for the evening, saying he made a great memory thanks to me. We ended up going to a motel and slept together. When we went to sleep, he asked me to hug and cuddle him.
The next morning, until checkout at 11am, he kept pulling my arm around him and wouldn’t leave my side. When we parted at the subway, he thanked me again, texted me when he got home, and even asked where I was and when I’d arrive home.

December 10

We met at my place. I cooked for him and we planned to watch a movie together. Before he came, I sent him a photo of the food, and later he told me he showed it to his mom. She complimented my cooking, and he proudly told her that he made a German friend. He even took some food home and ate it with his mom.
At my place, he chose a scary movie. During the movie, he held my hand, caressed it, squeezed it when I got scared, and rubbed my arm. Afterward, he felt tired, so we laid down and rested. Again, he took my arm and put it around his body, cuddled tightly, and we slept like that for about two hours.
We had dinner, and he kept saying how delicious my food was. After dinner, we cuddled more. He touched my hair, held my face, told me I was pretty, and we slept together again. After that, we cuddled again and watched TV. He left around 10pm because he had work the next day. Before leaving, he gave me a big hug.

December 12

We met again at my place. I cooked, and he said it was the best food he’s ever had. We watched TV and cuddled for about an hour. Then he suddenly brought up “what we are.”
He said that I'm totally his type but he hasn’t thought of me as more than a friend yet, and asked if it would be okay if we didn’t have a relationship and just met casually as friends or friends with benefits. He emphasized the “yet,” which confused me even more.
He also told me that he deleted the app where we met. Apparently, because he doesn't use the app anyway.
We talked more and ended up agreeing on clear FWB “rules”:

• hanging out outside as friends
• doing fun activities together
• having sex
• only sleeping with each other and not meeting other sex partners

I told him I didn’t necessarily mind FWB (I’ve done FWB once before) but honestly? That experience was much more casual. There was no constant cuddling, no romantic gestures, and no emotional closeness like this.
That same day, we slept together again, spent the evening cuddling, kissing, watching movies, and went to bed together. 
The next morning, he was supposed to go to his academy for test prep, but he skipped it just to stay with me longer. Is this normal?

Another thing that confuses me:
When we chat, he always asks about my day, whether I slept well, and he shares details about his own day too. He tells me when he arrives at work, when he finishes, what he’s doing throughout the day, and when he’s going to bed. This feels emotionally attentive and consistent, which doesn’t align with what I personally understand an FWB dynamic to be.

My questions:

• Is this actually normal FWB behavior?

• Is exclusivity + emotional closeness still considered FWB?

• Why would someone delete the app, act this affectionate, and still say they don’t want a relationship?

• Does he want a relationship without being aware of it?

I'm not looking for a relationship with him or anything. It's just that his behaviour makes me confused.

I’d really appreciate honest opinions. Thank you :)",1,1765698144.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1pm8g1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newark/comments/1pm8g1k/anyone_else_notice_how_normalized_day_drinking/,Anyone else notice how normalized day drinking has gotten in Newark's corporate scene?,"Look, I'm not trying to be preachy here but something's been bugging me and I need to know if I'm the only one seeing this. I've been working downtown Newark (finance/insurance sector) for about 6 years now. The drinking culture has always been there - client lunches, networking happy hours, whatever. But lately it feels like it's crossed some kind of line.

Yesterday I'm at a business lunch. 12:30pm. The guys I'm meeting with are on their second martini before we even order food. One of them makes a joke about ""liquid courage for the afternoon meetings."" Everyone laughs. But like... bro, you're going back to work?

This is becoming the norm, not the exception. I've got coworkers who I *know* keep booze in their desk drawers. People taking ""coffee breaks"" that smell suspiciously like whiskey. The running joke is ""it's 5 o'clock somewhere"" except it's literally 2pm on a Tuesday in Newark.

Here's what made me finally post about this - I came across Mendham-Chester local report about how alcohol use among professionals in Morris County jumped 19% since 2021. They're calling it ""functional alcoholism"" - people who are still showing up, still performing, but quietly falling apart. And I'm like... yeah, that's exactly what I'm seeing here in Newark too.

Before anyone says it: I'm not trying to be a buzzkill or some kind of nerd about this. People can have fun however they want - I don't care about that. What I'm talking about is different.

I've seen what happens when ""having fun"" turns into functional alcoholism. I watched someone I used to work with go from a healthy dude in his prime - sharp, successful, looked great - to literally looking like a textbook alcoholic within 3 years. Puffy face, shaky hands, the whole nine yards. He's still ""functional"" technically, still has his job, but the transformation was honestly brutal to witness.

That's why this stuff gets to me. It's not about being anti-fun. It's about watching a pattern I've seen destroy someone play out in slow motion all around me. The thing is: nobody talks about it. Everyone's too busy grinding, trying to look successful, keeping up appearances. God forbid you admit you're struggling or need help - that's career suicide in this environment.

So... Is this just normal corporate culture and I'm being dramatic? Or has anyone else noticed this getting worse?

Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind watching everyone around me casually develop drinking problems while we all just... pretend it's fine? Idk, maybe I just needed to vent. But if you're in Newark's corporate world and you've noticed this too, drop a comment. At least I'll know I'm not crazy.",2,1765698052.0,Newark,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to join or start a Purdue graduate study group to help keep me accountable and social while I work toward my academic goals. During COVID, I did Zoom study sessions with friends (different majors), and it really helped me stay focused and less distracted — figured it’d be great to recreate something similar in person.

A little about me:
• I’ll be taking Purdue graduate engineering courses online while working weekdays 9–5 in Seattle.
• I’m hoping to meet up in person at coffee shops, cafés, or even quieter bar spaces during non-busy hours (like Saturday mornings or other off-peak times).
• I imagine we’d be mindful of staff and keep it friendly for the venues.

Questions for you all: • Are there any existing in-person study groups around Seattle you’d recommend?
• Would anyone be interested in forming one — rotating locations (coffee shops, tea places, casual spots)?
• Open to all majors and schedules that work well with weekday evenings or weekend mornings!

Bonus: I’d also love to get to know fellow Purdue folks outside of studying — watching games, going to sports events, or meeting up for Purdue-related happenings around Seattle.

Looking forward to hearing from you 😊",1,1765698009.0,Purdue,0,1.0,False

Wager Amount: 0.4U to WIN 2.24U

League: Arizona Cardinals vs Houston Texans (12PM CST on FOX)

**Recap**: LET'S GO!!! THAT'S 3-STRAIGHT POTD WINS IN A ROW!✅✅✅ If you sprinkled on Kevin Vallejos ITD, congrats! I was so tempted!! Giga is so durable and that was his first time ever being finished! Hard to believe that this guy is 37 years old and has yet to been finish inside the octagon. Kevin Vallejos is the real deal! He was hesistant and gun shy in the 1st round, but he defitnely was not gun shy in the 2nd round!

**Matchup:** This is not a typo! I am taking Cards ML against the Texans. Oddsmaker, you can keep them stinkin' points, keep all of 'em matter in fact, I'm taking the Cardinals to win outright! Sounds crazy, huh? This looks like a donation. **Texans needs these win to stay in the AFC Wildcard race.** They are the one who are competing for meaningful games down the stretch, but I think these odds are absolutely disrespectful. Yes, I kno Texans have a nasty defense and they are playing at home where they are at their best. Cards will also be missing Marvin Harrison Jr. Texans also are the better team collectively too and it's not like CJ Stroud is playing in the cold weather, so why take the Cards? Tbh, I don't have any good reasons or even a gut feeling that Cardinals somehow might pull a massive upset, I just look at these odds and I just want to take a gamble. A near 5-1 odds is just crazy for a football game. It's also really boring to always giving you my favorite, best bets, or value wagers, sometimes I want to throw a gamble out there for you guys and this game is it, the **Cards ML!**

**Jacoby Brissett can cook, he has been one of the better QBs this season.** I will say that one the better bets for this game is Michael Wilson 7+ Rec. at +117 or even Jacoby Brissett 240+ Passing Yds at +111 which I might actually wager, but I'm making this as my POTD. I'm due for an L anyway. I can't win all these POTDs (also winning all the time is boring too), but it would be nice to hit this 5-1 odds, wouldn't it? Who wants to take a gamble wit me?! Any team in any game in any environment can lose. Doesn't matter how big of a favorite a team is, they can lose! Look at the OKC Thunder last nite! They were a -11.5 favorite and they loss! Upsets are not outside of realm of the possibility! It happens a lot more than you think! Momentum can play a big factor. Crazy turnovers. Injuries. Anything can happen in this event that can likely swing to the 5-1 underdog, so you rocking wit me on this one? Or you taking the chalky -650 ML on the Texans?

**The Play & Prediction :** This one is a gamble for me! I alrdy consider this 0.4U as a loss! I alrdy purchased my tix and if they win, I will treat it as a lottery win! No prediction on this one, but I have a feeling Cards put up a fight against that stingy Texans defense at home. Maybe take the points on this one or take the two other props I suggested, but **I'm taking Cards ML (+470), just 0.4U!**

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond. For all these years I have been handicapping on Sportsbook subreddit and thru my very own reddit channel, I have nothing but gratitude.

I know all I can do now is take these moments as lessons and cherish what we had and all of our potential. I know this is goodbye.

Last night, I couldn’t fall asleep. I haven’t really slept in days. All I could think about as I lay in bed were all the times I fell asleep next to you. You would hold me and stroke my hair, and when I would wake up guiltily, you would smile and tell me that seeing me rest made you happy. All I could think about last night was the way you would look at me and how much I loved you in those moments and how much you must have loved me. I wish I told you that then. That I loved you. Maybe more than I was ever able to express, more than you know.  So here it is, a final love letter, our second goodbye.

Even though things didn’t work out the way we wanted them to, I need you to know how deeply I loved our time together. I need you to know that even though things turned bad, youare good. I wouldn’t be okay if I didn’t tell you how incredible of a person you are. I’ve never really had faith in a higher power or that there is a plan out there for us. But after our time together, my heart has changed. I am always going to remember and be grateful for you. Because of you, I wasn’t alone for what felt like the first time in my life. I wasn’t alone during those really dark, scary moments when loss found me, and when I found grief. You were listening when I tried to make sense of the chaos and confusion of a really strange world. You held me up when I was trying to start a journey to healing. I can still hear you calling my name, your hand on mine while we sipped on coffees and walked along the water, your knock on my door, your fingers brushing my hair from my face, your laughter. I wasn’t alone then, and I’m not alone now, because you taught me not to be scared to be loved by others. I see all my friends and family embracing me, because you showed me how. You helped me tear down walls I didn’t even know I had built. The ones that filled the empty spaces left in the place of scars. The ones that kept me hidden.
You have to know you are one of the kindest, most patient, most hardworking, most loving, good women I have ever known. You strive every day to be better in all of the ways you are already good. I was excited each day to see what that looked like for you. I hope, I truly hope, that you felt my love too. I see you for everything you are, and everything you’re going to be. I want the whole world for you, and I know you’ll find it because good things happen to good people. We made a lot of mistakes. We weren’t equipped to receive love when we gave it or make room for each other when we needed it. I’m sorry. If I could take all those mistakes back, I would. But I wouldn’t trade a second of knowing you.
I know all I can do now is take these moments as lessons and cherish what we had and all of our potential. I know this is goodbye—our second goodbye. The first one was said as we looked into each other’s eyes, hearts breaking, minds filled with anger and regret. For this second one, we’re far apart from one another now, hearts broken but filled with the ease of knowing we found one another for a reason. Our brief moment where our lives intertwined, the good and the bad, it was all meant for something. I hope one day we find our way to one another again, maybe as strangers and maybe as friends. But if we don’t, I want you to hear me say these things one last time. Be gentle with yourself. I loved you. You’re a good woman , and I was so lucky.

1pm8826,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1pm8826/please_take_it_from_me_no_matter_how_long_youve/,"Please take it from me: no matter how long you've been quit, your addiction can still come back to bite you. Don't let yourself get stuck back here.","This is probably common sense advice, but I figured I would recount my experience anyway in case anyone here is like me and needs to see this like I did.

In July of 2024, I successfully quit vaping after several failed attempts. I tried cold turkey, Easyway, and NRT, and in the end what stuck was going cold turkey while really trying to keep the lessons from reading Easyway in mind. I kept reminding myself that I didn't need to function and that the only thing causing the relapsing was doing it in the first place. Somehow, I succeeded that time, and I went nearly a year and a half without vaping again.

For a while, I felt free. It was lovely not having to wonder where my vape was at all times. It was lovely not having to think about whether I would have enough juice in the pod for an outing. I spent almost the entirety of 2025 without ever thinking about it, and for the first time in almost 10 years it felt nearly foreign to me that I had ever engaged in the habit. What was once unthinkable - spending any significant portion of my life without this stupid piece of garbage electronics in my hand, utterly tethered to it - became my new normal.

Problem is, if you go long enough without doing something like using nicotine, you tend to forget. You forget how bad for you it was, how it felt physically and emotionally to be tied to a $50 piece of metal. How expensive it was to keep your vice, and the kind of pressure that expenditure could put on you and your partner. You forget all the reasons you wanted to quit in the first place as being healthier becomes your new normal. Eventually, no matter how hard you think you've conquered the addiction, it comes back - it always does. My failure was in thinking I could put being vigilant about it behind, feeling as though I had finally mastered myself in that aspect.

As fall settled in, I found myself suddenly craving clove cigarettes. I had never been that much of a regular smoker, but I always used to love cloves as a rare treat. I stupidly figured maybe it could be an opportunity to test how much I'd truly overcome my addiction — of course, the ""little monster"" (as Carr puts it), which I think never truly dies despite what Carr says, was using this as a workaround. I picked up a pack of Djarum blacks. The first few days were fine — I would smoke around one a day at lunch and enjoyed the opportunity to go to the outdoor portion of my work building and hang out with the stray cats out there. Then I would smoke 2. Then 3. Then I started inhaling, and felt the buzz I hadn't experienced in so long. That moment was the final nail in the coffin.

I picked up a pod vape at a shop a week or so after that, initially with some 6mg juice. I had a nihilistic attitude about it that I generally don't have about things. ""Who cares, nothing matters anyway."" And then I killed that 60mL bottle in less than a week. Picked up a couple more, vaping more and more throughout the day. Tried quitting spontaneously a couple times upon realizing the addiction was working its claws back into me. Since starting again a month or so ago, I've already spent a few hundred on replacements after throwing it away and capitulating later the same day multiple times. I've gone back up to 30mg strength and am vaping more than I ever have.

I hate how it feels. I'm getting those chest pains in my lungs that I haven't felt in some time. Every physical effort I make is harder. My chronic back pain has returned (though that also could've been because of the temperature drop in recent months). I cough, I hack up whatever film this stuff is accumulating in my lungs. I keep telling my partner I'm going to quit — I drown the damn thing, I throw it in the trash, and the next day I'm either digging through spent coffee grounds and moldy bread for it or running to the store to drop $80 on a new one with a bottle of juice.

TL;DR

**This isn't worth it. If you think you've mastered yourself and can handle it, you are wrong and foolish, plain and simple — as I am.** There is no reason to ever go back. What are you going back to? Chest discomfort? Crackling and wheezing in your lungs as you try to breathe? Reduced circulation in your extremities?

The only thing you're returning to is the monumental task of simultaneously **trying to quit again and learning to trust anything you say to yourself or your loved ones ever again.** If there's anything more dangerous about vaping than the physical effects it has upon your health, it's the fact that **nothing you say about your intentions matters anymore** when you go back to that choice to engage in a behavior that is slowly killing you. The only thing you can do is realize that it's **not worth it,** ***ever.*** 

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to be here trying to figure out how to overcome this again, this time probably twice as hard as it ever was.",8,1765697200.0,QuitVaping,4,0.9,False

It's called Dipscan. AI-powered swing trade system that gives exact entries, stops, and targets as a single SVG graphic. Sensei will be releasing Dipscan results (The full SVG) on his Substack every Monday and Thursday.

I beta tested it June-November. I expected it to be another overfit backtest with nice graphics. It wasn’t.

Here's my brutally honest take:

– Format (SVG graphics) → 9/10

Clean. No interpretation needed. You either take the setup or skip it.

– Accuracy (58% win rate, 5.2:1 avg R:R) → 8/10

Better than most $500/month scanners I've tested.
Loses points because 58% means you're still wrong 42% of the time. But the winners are 5x the losers, so math works out.

– Frequency (2x/week, Monday + Thursday) → 10/10
   
Not drowning you in signals. High conviction only. Actually sustainable for people with jobs.

– Price ($8/month) → 10/10

Two coffees. If you can't afford this, you can't afford to trade.

Overall: 9/10 for swing traders who want structure.

Sensei's annoyed I didn't give it a perfect score. Told him 9/10 IS perfect because nothing's flawless and anyone claiming 10/10 everything is lying.

He muttered something about ""insufferable standards."" 😅

I know all I can do now is take these moments as lessons and cherish what we had and all of our potential. I know this is goodbye.

Last night, I couldn’t fall asleep. I haven’t really slept in days. All I could think about as I lay in bed were all the times I fell asleep next to you. You would hold me and stroke my hair, and when I would wake up guiltily, you would smile and tell me that seeing me rest made you happy. All I could think about last night was the way you would look at me and how much I loved you in those moments and how much you must have loved me. I wish I told you that then. That I loved you. Maybe more than I was ever able to express, more than you know.  So here it is, a final love letter, our second goodbye.

Even though things didn’t work out the way we wanted them to, I need you to know how deeply I loved our time together. I need you to know that even though things turned bad, youare good. I wouldn’t be okay if I didn’t tell you how incredible of a person you are. I’ve never really had faith in a higher power or that there is a plan out there for us. But after our time together, my heart has changed. I am always going to remember and be grateful for you. Because of you, I wasn’t alone for what felt like the first time in my life. I wasn’t alone during those really dark, scary moments when loss found me, and when I found grief. You were listening when I tried to make sense of the chaos and confusion of a really strange world. You held me up when I was trying to start a journey to healing. I can still hear you calling my name, your hand on mine while we sipped on coffees and walked along the water, your knock on my door, your fingers brushing my hair from my face, your laughter. I wasn’t alone then, and I’m not alone now, because you taught me not to be scared to be loved by others. I see all my friends and family embracing me, because you showed me how. You helped me tear down walls I didn’t even know I had built. The ones that filled the empty spaces left in the place of scars. The ones that kept me hidden.
You have to know you are one of the kindest, most patient, most hardworking, most loving, good women I have ever known. You strive every day to be better in all of the ways you are already good. I was excited each day to see what that looked like for you. I hope, I truly hope, that you felt my love too. I see you for everything you are, and everything you’re going to be. I want the whole world for you, and I know you’ll find it because good things happen to good people. We made a lot of mistakes. We weren’t equipped to receive love when we gave it or make room for each other when we needed it. I’m sorry. If I could take all those mistakes back, I would. But I wouldn’t trade a second of knowing you.
I know all I can do now is take these moments as lessons and cherish what we had and all of our potential. I know this is goodbye—our second goodbye. The first one was said as we looked into each other’s eyes, hearts breaking, minds filled with anger and regret. For this second one, we’re far apart from one another now, hearts broken but filled with the ease of knowing we found one another for a reason. Our brief moment where our lives intertwined, the good and the bad, it was all meant for something. I hope one day we find our way to one another again, maybe as strangers and maybe as friends. But if we don’t, I want you to hear me say these things one last time. Be gentle with yourself. I loved you. You’re a good woman , and I was so lucky. 

     Love T.

I’ve done this a couple of times before because he wants to help out his friends and says I should get my work out there, so I end up spending hours and materials painting pizzas, beer or christmas decorations on peoples windows for free. I told him that it’s not something I enjoy doing that much and I do it because of him, I see it as a job and not a fun time I’m having with him. Then he said he felt horrible that i didn’t enjoy the little things with him and said he wants a girlfriend that agrees with him and enjoys doing the same things, he even started questioning if we had that much in common and that he didn’t wanted to go paint the shop anymore since I didn’t enjoy it, he drove the car and kept talking for about two hours. I didn’t knew what to say or how to calm him down, I’m autistic and not good at handling disagreements or changes of plans and wasn’t trying to sound dismissive or rude when I said that I wasn’t gonna have fun, I didn’t knew how to answer after that and kept quiet listening to him.

Rating: 5 out of 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

You can’t expect less from Juan Carlo. They live up to their name as one of the country’s best caterers. They’re one of our non-nego suppliers. We prioritized food + overall experience. And if service lang rin usapan, I think top 1 pa rin ang JC.

Hit sa guests yung cocktail hour pikapika na palabok! Sayang lang, because of the coordinator, hindi na-serve yung welcome drinks sana from JC. Napunta sa cocktail hours. This could have elevated sana the guest experience since hindi usually nagsserve ng welcome drinks sa wedding. Full kwento and review sa coor below. Haiii. 

Our sales associate, Ms Leslie was easy to talk to. Madami kaming freebies from them lalo na gusto namin na lahat ng guests felt like VIP. They did their best para hindi madistinguish ang VIP vs non-VIP. 

They also allowed our request to have a “grand finale” dessert parade instead of the usual dinner opening parade. Guests loved our food and syempre yung experience. After our wedding, yung stories ng guests namin puro yung lighting ng Hidden Taal dessert!

Until now the guests are raving this onsite photo studio experience! Hindi kasi sya yung usual photo booth nyo na bahala na kayo sa posing etc. With Moments Lab, para talaga kayong nasa professional studio. May pose director.

Nakakatuwa yung unti-unti napupuno yung feed ko ng profile photo taken by Moments Lab.. Sabi nung iba nag up daw yung looks nila from 6 to 10!haha 

One of our best decisions to pick an onsite photo studio vs the normal photo booth and photo man. Elevated ang guest experience!

Rating: 5 out of 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I’m a coffee lover and gusto ko kapeng kape yung lasa ng coffee. Yung hindi puro asukal. Meron sana akong top coffee cart kaso ang mahal ng OTF to Batangas. 

So I went with my top 2 which was Ouah. Masarap yung coffee base nila. Our guests loved their biscoff coffee. Ako naman personally, I loved their spanish latte. :) 

The owner was also nice and hands on. Talagang andun sya sa event to monitor her staff and help prepare the drinks. She even commented sa vows ko and the wedding ceremony. So glad we decided to open their cart during the welcoming of our guests. I think they were a hit because parang 2-3 cups lang ata natira considering na less than 90 lang nag attend na guests.

Rating: 5 out of 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We aren’t really party people. Same with most of our guests. Hindi lahat mahilig sa hard. Pero we opted for a mobile bar to complete the reception experience. Same with Ouah, KK’s owner was very hands on. Mabilis sila magrespond to queries. 

My gauge for choosing a mobile bar was how nice their amaretto sour is.lol Masarap yung sa kanila kaya we got them. Guests also loved the drinks! Ubos yung flasks during our chill after party. 

# Content Creator - Mrs Gipit 

2025 Rate: 24k For 14 hours + otf

Rating: 5 out of 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Our content creator was truly a breath of fresh air. From the moment she arrived, I already loved her aura na fun, positive, and very easy to be around. Feeling ko nga close na agad kami.lol

She captured every single important detail and all the highlights of our wedding so beautifully. If you check her profile, you’ll really see that this is her strength. Not everyone has the eye to know what moments matter and need to be captured, but she definitely does.

Medyo sayang lang yung extension kasi we didn’t really have a loud or super energetic after party. Mas chill tito-tita vibes yung amin since we preferred catching up and kwentuhan — busy na kasi lahat with their own lives. Still, that’s more on our event vibe and not on her at all.

The day after our wedding, she was rushed to the hospital, which caused a delay in our reels. But honestly, it was completely okay — she communicated well and even added extra reels to compensate, which we really appreciated.

Overall, super happy and grateful we added a content creator and of course that we chose her. Would still 100% recommend her, especially if you value storytelling and details over just trendy shots. 💛

# String Quartet - Quartet Manila

They are very professional. They created their own arrangement of our theme song. They have a wide variety of songs to choose from.

She’s famous here sa Reddit for being that classy host. We loved her hosting. Since yung guests namin ay mostly seniors + titos and titas, lam nyo na pag pumatak 9pm mga wala nang energy. She was able to keep the reception fun and the energy up! So kudos to her for that. 🤍

She’s also organized. Gave us word docs for program months before the wedding. 

# Florals - Ruhe Floral Studio

2025 Rate: 47k for bridal bouquet + entourage flowers

Rating: 4.9 out of 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Sobrang daming good compliments sa bouquet ko! It was definitely not your usual bridal bouquet — hindi siya yung typical cascading or round style. Mas modern, unique, and very intentional yung dating, kaya talagang nag-stand out siya. Aside from flowers, I added pearls sa bridal bouquet, groom buttonieres, saka dun sa mga ninangs, kaya medyo tumaas ang rates. 

Ruhe was one of my fave suppliers. My vision was perfectly executed. I sent them very detailed pegs, iba-iba sa ninangs, dads, MOHs, and they were able to translate and curate everything into something even better than I imagined.

\-0.1 kasi medyo na-cold-an lang ako sa kanila 😅  but okay lang, as long as perfect ang output.

Their cake was GORGEOUS!!! It was built during the cocktail hours.

You know, some weeks in the market are loud and chaotic. This wasn't one of them. This week felt… quietly important. One of those times when the big shifts happen under the surface.

On one hand, inflation is so low it’s barely a whisper, which should feel great. But on the other, the rupee slid to a fresh low, making that US university plan or next year's international holiday feel just a little bit heavier on the wallet. Regulators also made a few small-print changes that, honestly, could have a massive impact on our portfolios over the next decade.

We’re going to spend most of our time today unpacking one of them: the new flexibility inside your NPS account. They’ve finally given it ***more equity muscle*** and ***more asset options***, which forces a really healthy question: **how should you think about your retirement money** versus your other goals, especially when the currency can move faster than your salary? It's also probably why silver, after going quiet following its big roar during Diwali, is suddenly back in the conversation and you should be taking a note here!

So grab your coffee. Let's make sense of it all.

# Deep Dive: Your ""Boring"" NPS Just Got a Major Upgrade

Just as we approach the year-end tax planning season, the PFRDA has dropped a massive gift for retirement savers. The investment universe for the NPS has been significantly expanded.

Most investors treat NPS as a rigid, ultra-conservative debt product that barely beats inflation. The common myth is that ""NPS can't create wealth like mutual funds because it can't buy the high-growth mid-cap stocks."" 

Or, investors only did invest in NPS for the ₹50k tax benefit. 

That myth is now officially dead. The regulator has expanded the equity investment universe from the ""Top 200"" to the **Top 250** stocks. This seemingly small change is significant: it allows pension fund managers to tap into the high-growth ""large-midcap"" segment that often drives alpha in long-term portfolios.

Furthermore, fund managers can now invest up to a certain limit in **Gold and Silver ETFs** and treat REITs/InvITs as equity. Since commodities are priced in dollars, having them in your NPS protects your retirement corpus when the INR depreciates: exactly like we saw this week.

By adding precious metals, you now have a built-in ""shock absorber."" Gold and Silver act as a hedge against inflation and, more importantly, against the falling Rupee.

Coupled with the new rule allowing debt investments with a single credit rating (previously two were required), your fund manager now has the flexibility to hunt for better risk-adjusted returns.

Here's what you should do this weekend:



1. **Log into your CRA portal** (NSDL/Protean) and review your current asset allocation. If you're under 45 and stuck in conservative mode (say, 50% equity), you're leaving money on the table. Consider shifting to **75% equity (Scheme E)** allocation to capture this new midcap + gold diversification.
2. **If you're 35–50 years old**, this is the sweet spot. You have enough time to ride out volatility but not so much that you can afford to be lazy. The expanded universe means your NPS can now potentially deliver **11–12% annualized returns** over the long term (vs. the earlier 8–9%), which compounds to crores more at retirement.
3. **Stop treating NPS as ""lock-in = bad.""** Yes, liquidity is restricted, but that's precisely why it works for retirement. You can't panic-sell during corrections. The gold addition now gives you automatic rebalancing during currency crises without you lifting a finger.



# Market Pulse

If your portfolio felt a bit bruised this week, don't worry; you aren't imagining it.

While the headline Nifty 50 only dipped slightly, the real pain was in the broader market, where Smallcaps corrected nearly 2%.

It’s a classic tug-of-war: FIIs kept selling aggressively (₹9,200 Cr), but your SIP money (via DIIs) fought back twice as hard (₹20,200 Cr), keeping the indices stable.

The one red flag to watch? The Rupee. Crossing 90 against the dollar makes international goals pricier, even as falling oil prices give us some breathing room.

# The Sabiduria Shortlist

Here are five other critical stories from the week that might have flown under your radar, but deserve a spot in your financial plan.

**1. No More Flights for Signatures: SEBI Eases NRI KYC** If you or your family members are NRIs, the headache of maintaining Indian investment accounts just disappeared. SEBI has finally allowed Non-Resident Indians to complete their ""re-KYC"" process digitally from abroad, removing the archaic requirement to be physically present in India or send physical documents. This ensures your mutual fund SIPs and bank accounts won't get frozen for minor compliance gaps.



* **What to do:** If your NRI account status is dormant or due for an update, check your bank's portal immediately. You can likely fix it in minutes from your phone.



**2. RBI’s War on ""Hidden"" Bank Fees** The RBI is currently cracking down on banks that double-dip on fees, specifically targeting ""penal charges"" for non-maintenance of minimum balance when you are already paying for other services. Many Public Sector Banks have already started scrapping these redundant charges, which often quietly bleed savings accounts.



* **What to do:** Take ten minutes this Sunday to audit your latest bank statement. If you see vague ""service charges"" or maintenance fees, query your relationship manager or switch to a lender that has already adopted the new friendly norms.



**3. Insurance Gets Cheaper (But Premiums Are Soaring)** The insurance sector is in a unique flux: while new business premiums surged over 20% in November, the GST council has exempted term life and individual health policies from GST. This is a massive win for affordability, even though insurers are grumbling about the withdrawal of ""Input Tax Credit"" which hurts their margins.



* **What to do:** If you’ve been sitting on the fence, buy your term and health insurance now. The full GST benefit is being passed to consumers, making it the most cost-efficient time to lock in your family's protection.



**4. The ""Whale"" Signal: Time to Rotate?** Veteran investor Raamdeo Agrawal sounded a crucial alarm this week: valuations in the small-cap segment are stretched to dangerous levels (PE multiples of 50-70x), while heavyweights like HDFC and Reliance have been left behind. This divergence usually screams ""mean reversion,"" meaning large-caps are poised to catch up while small-caps cool down.



* **What to do:** Don't get greedy with your small-cap winners. Review your portfolio, and if your small-cap allocation has bloated, book some profits and move that money into large-cap index funds or stable blue chips.



**5. The Passive Investing Gap** While ""Smart Money"" (EPFO, corporates, and HNIs) has aggressively moved into low-cost passive funds (growing assets 2.3x), retail investors are still lagging, holding only 7% of these assets.

# Chart of the Week

# The Silver Super-Cycle & Why You Need ""Hard Assets""

https://preview.redd.it/4bvtp9olb47g1.png?width=1204&format=png&auto=webp&s=13332886dc3c847cb75ac53087f5535e8142bc01

While equity markets are choppy, Silver has quietly staged a massive breakout, surging to a fresh peak of **₹1,98,000 per kg** this week. Gold isn't far behind, trading around **₹1,31,040 per 10g** (24K).

This chart matters right now because it highlights the critical role of ""hard asset"" diversification in your portfolio. With the Rupee depreciating to 90.47 against the dollar, assets priced in global currency, like Gold and Silver act as a natural hedge. When the Rupee falls, your metal portfolio automatically gains value in INR terms, cushioning the blow of currency inflation.

**The Personal Finance Takeaway:** Precious metals are no longer just ""dead assets"" in a locker; they are functional insurance.



* **Role in Portfolio:** They reduce volatility. When stocks crash or the currency weakens, metals often hold firm or rise.
* **The ""NPS Trigger"":** We are likely to see sustained, healthy demand for Gold and Silver going forward. Why? Because the new NPS rules now allow pension funds to buy Gold and Silver ETFs. This creates a structural, long-term buyer (your retirement money) entering the market, which supports prices fundamentally.



**Action:** Ensure you have at least **10-15% exposure** to commodities. If you haven't started, Gold and Silver ETFs are the cleanest way to build this ""portfolio armor."" However, avoid deploying large lumpsum amount into Gold and Silver at the moment. You can start building position using monthly SIPs.

# What to Watch Next Week

* **The 26k Battleground:** All eyes are on the **26,000** level for Nifty. If it breaks decisively, expect the pain in high-beta smallcaps to deepen as traders rush to cover leverage.
* **The Fed's Whisper:** While domestic cues are thin, global markets will be sensitive to any commentary on the US Fed's 2026 rate cut path. A hawkish tone could strengthen the dollar index, putting further pressure on the Rupee (and your portfolio).
* **Macro Reality Check:** Watch for the market's delayed reaction to the latest **IIP (Industrial Production)** numbers. If industrial activity slows while inflation stays low, it strengthens the case for the RBI to cut rates sooner: a potential booster shot for Banking stocks.

# Investor Action

**Stay Cautious & Rebalance.** The 1.9% crack in smallcaps isn't a ""buy the dip"" opportunity yet. Use this volatility to **rebalance**. 

If your portfolio is heavy on small-caps (which are still expensive), trim some profits and move them into safer Large-Cap funds or the newly flexible NPS equity schemes. 

Stick to your disciplined SIPs, but keep your lumpsum cash on the sidelines for now. Let the market find its floor first.",1,1765695664.0,IndiaMoneyTalks,0,1.0,False

Keep in mind what may work for me may differ for you. Try a patch test for creams. TLDR for diet/lifestyle, and TLDR for urgent situation

  
These are a couple of random notes that have helped, a bit of a story, and approaches that have helped.

It's been pretty bad for like a month now. I tried these after reading some forums, these approaches didn't work for me but they work for some people: colloidal oatmeal bar of soap, (I combined black seed oil and oregano oil and applied to the skin and they both didn't work I never tried them individually), I used to take a spoonful of apple cider vinegar every morning after seeing a youtube video about it. I don't anymore 

I hope to give some information which may provide some convenience to those who have this condition after reading many posts in this forum and reciprocate the information given to me. It started towards the end of October and became unbearable as November progressed. I think for me it was the stress of the semester because stress can cause flares. I honestly don't even know why this happened though. It came to a point where I just wasn't able to go to school for a bit. Moving further into November it got worse and worse. I wake up at like 2-3am and I'm wide awake for a few hours and fall asleep at like 9-10am. It has been getting a little better though with a little bit of lifestyle changes.



As of recently I cut out coffee and haven't been waking up in the middle of the night anymore (idk if it's bc of the coffee directly or less stress levels \[I play video games to try to calm me down and it has been calming me down\]... and I will also be trying out Reishi mushroom capsules to see if they can help me with sleep quality). 



Cutting out junk food has made my flares slightly better but I still deal with them. I don't have as much chips, cookies, sugar etc. I have been drinking Oolong tea since it's reportedly good for eczema. Also, trying to cut out stress. I NEVER eat fast food. Avoid cinnamon, cinnamon raisin bread, dairy, artificial bs, food with preservatives, canola oil, vegetable oil, try your best ro reduce the sugar intake, orange juice is pretty acidic so I'd recommend apple juice as an alternative if you want something sweet, no soda,



It can be hard to read this if you're stressed but reach out to a loved one or a friend or do something you love doing, it can help because added stress do make the flares worse. Making my showers lukewarm as opposed to hot has helped slightly. And if you're dealing with horrible eczema, I suggest starting off with lukewarm temperature water for a tiny bit (for comfort) and then transitioning into cold water. It does make me feel a little better during and after the shower especially if the flare is REALLY bad. And after I step out of the shower, I slightly dry my skin with a towel but leave it relatively moist/ damp, then apply some Oleavicin cream (which is not a steroid btw) then eczema friendly Vaseline on top. I love Oleavicin very much, it was at the local Walgreens for me. 

  
So far, I feel a lot more mobile than I was a month ago, a little bit more comfortable, slightly less stressed, and I hope to God that this can blow over. I hope that this information can help you somehow. If this adds value to your life, I will be really happy for you. I pray you get better, and I would like to thank you for reading this message. God bless you <3 



P.S. It can help to ask ChatGPT for common triggers. That worked for me. Feel free to leave a comment if this helps, or asking if i tried anything new since this post

TLDR lifestyle/diet approach (tried to simplify as much as possible):

no more coffee/ limit coffee temporarily, limit dairy, no preservatives/ BS food, lukewarm showers, no fragrance scents, limit dusty surroundings, avoid stress causations much as possible, cut nails FREQUENTLY. Try rubbing instead of scratching if you can resort to it. Don't be DIRECTLY in front of a heater, avoid canola oil, sunflower oil, excess sugar, fast food, greasy foods, Oolong tea is reportedly good for eczema, 



TLDR steps to treat discomfort immediately (for me):

  
Apply Oleavicin to the skin then eczema friendly Vaseline on top

  
Aloe vera blended as a juice and applied to skin during a shower has helped hydrate the skin a little. 

  
Slightly warm shower and then transition into cold water. Use eczema friendly non fragrance dove soap

  
If the weather outside is cold, sometimes it helps me to cool off outdoors as opposed to a warm environment indoors

  
Castor oil applied to skin may help

wearing a sweater/ thick clothes can act as a shield to prevent you from further scratch despite you may feel strong discomfort now

Smaller than the standard cup of coffee made in the West, they are geared to strong scented coffee, like the famous Lebanese or Turkish-style coffee. These cups are designed not only aesthetically but are functional and show centuries of traditions and practices of the coffee ceremonies. Most Lebanese coffee cups have elaborate designs, gold decorative touches or hand-painted designs which make the coffee drinking experience ritualistic and significant. Many collectors and coffee lovers often want to possess authentic Lebanese coffee cups as their practical kitchenware and also use as a decorative piece. Such websites as Alibaba have also proven helpful to people who wish to find a great selection of Lebanese coffee cups, including both handcrafted artisanal and modern and mass produced ones. This is due to the ease of accessing the global sellers who offer unusual designs that may not be readily available in the local markets. 

Besides the visual features of the coffee cup, Lebanese coffee cup is also contributing to the whole experience of coffee drinking, as it focuses on hospitality and social connection. The coffee is served in such small, well designed cups, making people take it more slowly and thoughtfully, usually with some conversations and story telling. The cups themselves can be very diverse in material, porcelain to ceramic, both having an impact on the perception of the flavor of the coffee and the retention of its heat. A large number of prospective customers of the cultural traditions are also interested in buying sets of Lebanese coffee cups to present as a gift to the person as it is the sign of warmth, kindness, and tradition. Alibaba allows getting a wide range of these cups, as the selections are available at varying prices and preferences. Through the amalgamation of the ancient artistry to the present day shopping comfort, consumers will have the opportunity to savor the taste of the traditional Lebanese coffee cups without necessarily travelling abroad.",1,1765694973.0,nowherecoffeeclub,2,1.0,False

I have 7 week old twins who are exclusively breastfed. Around 5 weeks old, my son started getting extremely fussy, painful gas, and red/rough bumps on his face and head (like eczema or very severe baby acne, but it’s not improving with my breastmilk or aquaphor). His poop has been getting more mucusy and was borderline green today. 

Around 6 weeks old, my daughter started getting overly gassy, having very mucusy orange poop (turned green with red specks today) and is spitting up a lot and is very fussy the last few days. 

I consume tonsss of sugar/candy. Like an unhealthy amount. (I know it’s bad but I’m breastfeeding two babies so I’m starving all the time and I have a major sweet tooth) Things like m&ms, sour patch kids, baked goods like brownies, Nutella, and sweet coffee drinks from Starbucks. 

My husband found anecdotal evidence across reddit and other websites that maybe it could be all the processed sugar. 

I actually think he may be right because my firstborn had green, mucusy, bloody poop for a LONG time, so I took her to an allergist but she had no allergies to anything. Her pediatrician was really not concerned but told me I could eliminate dairy and soy, which I did from the time she was 4 months old to when she started eating lots of solids around 12m. The bloody mucusy poop never went away until she was around a year old. 

So because of that, it makes me wonder if it IS too much sugar. I had continued to have lots of sugar with my first, I just found dairy and soy free options.

His official Service Dog vest, complete with the official, non-negotiable medical emblem, was a beacon of law and order in this temple of consumer chaos. He was performing a 'cover' task, creating a calm, golden-furred barrier between me and the line of shoppers intensely debating the probiotic content of raw sauerkraut.

Then, the noise started. A frantic, pathetic ""clack-clack-clack"" of unclipped claws on the polished floor, followed by a theatrical, wheezing cough.

""Oh, darling, are you sure you can make it? You’ve been so sensitive since your chakras were misaligned at that last spin class,"" cooed a voice that scraped across my nerves like steel wool on a chalkboard.

I looked up. Strutting past the organic produce was Prudence. Her platinum bob looked surgically sharp, and her attire screamed ""I have more disposable income than patience."" But it was her companion that made my stomach clench: a terrified, straining Chihuahua named 'Captain Fluffernutter.'

The tiny dog was crammed into a harness with a cheap, glittery iron-on patch proclaiming: ""EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL: Highly Trained to Detect Stress Aura."" Captain Fluffernutter looked like a nervous taxidermy project who wanted nothing more than to be anywhere else. He was also wearing a hand-knitted, mustard-yellow scarf.

Prudence's eyes locked onto Atlas. The sight of my calm, composed, working dog seemed to short-circuit her entire wellness routine. She zeroed in on us like a guided missile targeting my last shred of peace.

""Oh, excuse me,"" she boomed, and the entire smoothie line went silent. ""But I must ask that you immediately leash your dog and remove it from the premises. It is distracting Captain Fluffernutter from his duties!""

I blinked, genuinely stunned. Atlas, my rock, simply offered a soft, calming nudge to my hand. I tried to speak slowly and calmly, though the words felt like cotton in my mouth.

""Ma'am, this is Atlas. He is a fully-trained Service Dog,"" I explained, gesturing to his vest. ""He is actively performing a task right now and is under control. He's also legally allowed to be here under the ADA.""

Prudence let out a dramatic, chest-heaving scoff. ""Legal? Legal? Sweetie, do you truly think I haven't done my research? I have read the PDFs, and your large, untrained pet is clearly a menace and a tripping hazard. Captain Fluffernutter's presence is covered under the Emotional Support Clause, Section 4.B, Paragraph 7 of my personal wellness plan.""

She then thrust the miserable little creature toward Atlas. Captain Fluffernutter let out a pathetic, high-pitched ""YIP!""—a sound that embodied sheer, unadulterated fear of the world.

Atlas, bless his golden, professional heart, didn't even twitch an ear. He just gave the Chihuahua a slow, deliberate Golden Retriever side-eye that perfectly communicated: 'Is this your best effort? I was trained for bears, not this amateur hour.'

""My dog is trained to ignore distractions,"" I articulated, trying to maintain a clinical distance from the rising bile in my throat. ""If your dog is truly a service animal, it should also be task-trained and public access ready, which includes ignoring other working dogs.""

That was the line. Her face, previously merely condescending, now morphed into a terrifying mask of aggressive entitlement.

""How dare you question my dog's TRAINING!"" she shrieked. My ears were actually ringing. ""Captain Fluffernutter is a highly sensitive detection specialist! His task is to alert me to the presence of negative energy, microaggressions, and high-fructose corn syrup! And right now, darling, your dog is creating an immense amount of negative energy! He’s disrupting my entire vibrational frequency!""

She then leaned in, invading my personal space, forcing me to breathe in her overpowering, expensive perfume.

""I need you to prove your dog's necessity,"" she hissed, yet loud enough to summon the ghost of every yoga instructor in a ten-mile radius. ""Show me his official certification card! I know for a fact that the Service Dog Registry of North America (a shady website I saw once) requires an ID badge! Where is his badge? Mine is laminated!""

She pointed to a wrinkled, coffee-stained card dangling precariously from the Chihuahua's collar. I fought the urge to pull out my phone and start recording.

""The ADA does not require identification, registration, or a card, ma’am,"" I explained for the thousandth time in my career as a Service Dog Handler. ""I don't carry one. But I can assure you Atlas is trained to alert me to—""

""AHA!"" Prudence sliced through my sentence, her hands clapping like cymbals. ""Fraud! I knew it! You're trying to sneak your untrained pet into a place of business to buy your unethical sea salt! You are making a mockery of my very real, very valid disability! Captain Fluffernutter, commence your stress-alert task!""

Captain Fluffernutter responded to this command by emitting a stream of panicked, wheezy yaps and immediately trying to tunnel into the lining of her designer purse.

A young store manager, visibly defeated by life and sporting a magnificent, tragic beard, shuffled over. He looked like he’d rather be sorting moldy produce than deal with this.

""Ladies, everything okay?"" he mumbled, clipboard held defensively across his chest. ""We just want everyone to enjoy their ethically sourced kombucha.""

Prudence immediately transferred her fury to him. ""No! It is not okay! This woman is here with an unauthorized animal that is causing my actual, legitimate, highly-sensitive service animal distress! I am experiencing a flare-up of my chronic fatigue due to the sheer lack of respect! I need you to ask her to leave immediately, or I will be contacting the corporate office and the Better Business Bureau and possibly the local media!""

He looked from Atlas, who was now resting his chin on my ankle, to Captain Fluffernutter, who was still attempting a successful purse-ectomy.

""Ma'am,"" the manager began, clearly trying to mediate a geopolitical conflict. ""The larger dog is clearly a service animal...""

""He has no card! He is an impostor!"" she wailed.

I reached for the $14 bag of artisan sea salt and slapped it onto the counter. The cringe level had reached a critical mass; I had to retreat.

""You know what?"" I said, mustering a smile so tight it hurt my cheeks. ""You win. Captain Fluffernutter clearly needs this store more than I do. Have a lovely, high-vibrational day.""

I gave Atlas a sharp, silent hand signal, and we executed a perfect, professional retreat. As we walked out, leaving the sound of Prudence aggressively educating the manager on her 'Aura Protection Protocols' behind us, I looked down at my dog.

Atlas met my gaze, let out a deep, soft 'huff' of pure Service Dog disdain, and I knew exactly what he was thinking: 'You paid $14 for salt, and you subjected me to that? We need to talk about your life choices.'

I had survived, but the psychic scars from that interaction—and the sheer, raw cringe of that tiny scarf—would last a lifetime.",0,1765694581.0,ServiceDogsCircleJerk,0,0.2,False

After some mutual situationship chaos, she basically moved on to another guy. 

I had mostly been no contact since July, outside a few random messages she sent me. 

I was foolish to think that maybe she was reaching out because she wanted to give things another shot; she was just trying to initiate a friendzone buddy-ship.

While it was nice to get to see her, I told her friendship wasn't possible (too painful) and to let me know if she ever changed her mind and wanted to give it another shot.

I'm not feeling well. 

I think most people wait in no contact for the kind of invite I got today and think ""this is it---she's finally realized we're meant to be together...."" 

I think people need to learn from this and be direct; ask ""why do you want to meet"" instead of just showing up -- and lying to yourself that you have no expectations.

I've been playing with LLMs on weekends and decided to build something actually useful - a security scanner for Zapier

I was creating some Zaps and realized how easy it is to accidentally create security holes like unsecured exposed webhooks, etc.)

Asked my friends who used Zapier, most had secure zaps, but one other friend also had some hardcoded stuff. Zapier actually asks you not to hardcode keys, but eh! he did it anyways. So I figure others may be using insecure practices. Btw the Zapier copilot will also help you build secure stuff.

Coming back to the point, I tried console scripts, chrome extensions as a way to test all zaps and landed on the Chrome extension as the best method to review all your zaps and check for vulnerabilities. Its locally installed, ie information doesn't leave your browser window and is local(no data sent anywhere).

**What I built: Kintsugi** \- Its free Chrome extension that scans your Zapier workspace in 60 seconds.

**Currently detects:**

* 🔴 Hardcoded API keys & secrets
* 🔴 Command injection (eval, exec, etc.)
* 🟠 Insecure webhooks
* 🟡 PII in Zap names

I tried to put in some security considerations on how to fix each issue if detected

**How it works:**

1. Install Chrome extension
2. Go to [zapier.com/app/zaps](http://zapier.com/app/zaps)
3. Click extension → Scan
4. Get detailed report

**Download:**   [https://github.com/peanutlife/kintsugi/releases/download/v1.0.0/kintsugi-extension-v1.0.0.zip](https://github.com/peanutlife/kintsugi/releases/download/v1.0.0/kintsugi-extension-v1.0.0.zip)

This is my first attempt at building security tools with LLMs. Planning to spend more weekends adding SQL injection detection, input validation checks, etc.

**Feedback welcome!** If you test it and find it useful (or find bugs), please let me know.

**Star the repo if this helps you:** [https://github.com/peanutlife/kintsugi](https://github.com/peanutlife/kintsugi) ⭐

**Note** \- Its free and I will keep updating it to check for more vulnerabilities and other no-code automation platforms, if you have any recommendations as the top other ones that I can go build some security scanner, let me know.  
Also  well if you benefit from it buy me coffee sometime a. I will post a link.

**My (28f) boyfriend’s (30M) ex hid a note about his cleaning/dating habits right before they broke up that I just found. How do I talk to him about cleaning habits without him feeling like I’m using his ex’s words against him?**



Throwaway account because I don’t want my boyfriend to find this. I posted this elsewhere but thought this subreddit could help too.

I (28f) and my bf (30m) who we’ll call “Steve” have been together for 2 years and have been living together for 8 months. I was cleaning our apartment when I found a note in the back of a cabinet. For context sake, I’ll copy it below:

“Dear Steve’s Future Girlfriend,

I know it’s you reading this because he’d never clean back here. I’m putting this here because I’m leaving him soon and want to warn you about him:



1. He will not clean
2. He will not listen
3. He will make everything feel like it’s your fault



It’s not your fault, he’s just an incompetent man. I’m leaving him, I suggest you do the same.

Best wishes, Natalia “ (name changed)





I read the note and brought it to show to him and hear his response. He immediately ripped it up and said not to listen to it, that she was crazy and untrustworthy. I told him that the fact that he hasn’t found it in the 5 years since they broke up is a red flag to me because it does mean he’s never cleaned back there and that he has been cleaning less and less since I moved in. He told me that it wasn’t a problem before the note, this is just his ex continuing to manipulate and ruin his life and I was letting it work. We continued to argue along the same lines and I eventually left to spend the night at a friends place.

Steve has been a great boyfriend so far. He gets along with my family. He has given me gifts and flowers and always tells me how much he loves me. He’s not wrong that the cleaning hasn’t really been brought up before, the note made me realize it had been less and less and that we needed to have a full conversation. He texted me afterwards saying he’s sorry that I felt like I had to leave but that it’s an asshole move for me to take a note over our 2 year relationship and to leave him and our pets alone.

I don’t know what to do or what to believe right now. I’m contemplating trying to find and reach out to Natalia, her name in real life is pretty unique so I think I could find her. Steve thinks I should come back home and let it go, that his past should effect our future. I feel like I could be the asshole because everything Steve has said about Natalia does make it sound like she was manipulative and petty throughout their relationship, but I don’t know what to trust.

Edit: I realized I didn’t clarify enough about the points, especially the cleaning. thought I’d add it here:

When we moved in together 8 months ago, the cleaning was 50/50. Since then, he’s been doing things less and less and i’d say it’s at like 70/30, maybe 60/40 if he listens to me right away (it depends on the week). I have to remind him to do things like bring his plates to the sink or take out the trash and I didn’t have to before. The dishes will pile up unless I do them, to the point he’s had leftover food mold on the plates. I’m not a confrontational person so I was just asking him to fix it when it came up. The note made me reflect on it more and try to have an actual full conversation, and I will say I didn’t feel listened to when I talked to him about it. I tried to use the note to start a conversation about cleaning and he got so stuck on that I was listening to his ex instead of him, that he wouldn’t listen to what I think are valid concerns. He thinks I’m letting the note have “confirmation bias” so no matter what he says I’ll think he’s in the wrong.

Also, I didn’t leave him permanently, this all happened yesterday and I only spent one night at a friends because I didn’t feel like our conversation was going anywhere last night and he wouldn’t let me sleep until I let it go. I’m going back today and wanted to get advice and feedback before I do.

Edit 2: I appreciate all these comments with advice. I’m heading back to our place now. My plan is to first apologize for immediately bringing him the note without thinking of his feelings and validate that it’s hard to have an ex’s message found.

That being said, you’re all right that I’ve been letting the cleaning stuff get away. I don’t want to be in a relationship where I have to ask him repeatedly to clean. It was pointed out to me that he should’ve cleaned the shelves during his move from his ex’s place, the fact that it hasn’t been touched in 5 years is forcing me to take the not seriously. I don’t want to throw away 2 years so I am going to ask him to come up with some clear cleaning expectations with me and designated chores. I will make it clear that cleaning is absolutely a deal breaker for me. It’s his decision on how he wants to respond.

I’ll try to update you all. Again, thank you so much for the advice.



**UPDATE:**

I followed your advice from the last post and tried to have a calm discussion with Steve. When I apologized for confronting him with the note, he seemed to take that as an admission of guilt and refused to listen to anything else. I had come up with a list of specific instances of not cleaning like many of you suggested, and he said I was using lists just like his manipulative ex did. So yeah, the crazy ex thing you all said was a red flag was definitely true.

When I realized the conversation wasn’t going anywhere, he even tried to block me from leaving. That’s when I knew it was done and left immediately. 2 years down the drain, but I’m glad I had the wake up call before it was too late.

I will let him cool off and then will ask my brother to come with me to grab my things while he’s not there, he has a strict work schedule so I think it’ll work out. I am planning on leaving a note there, but probably a little longer with the advice to not show it to him. I’m leaving it in the exact same place, so if he doesn’t learn his lesson about cleaning, it’ll come to haunt him. All he has to do is clean.

The biggest surprise out of all of this is that I didn’t reach out to Natalia, she reached out to me. Apparently he borrowed his friend’s phone to call her screaming that she’s ruining his life still. The fact that she blocked him and he still had her number memorized just further confirms he was the crazy ex not her.

Natalia found me on social media and wanted to make sure I was okay and was especially concerned that he’d gaslight me like he tried with her. I thanked her for leaving me the note and saving me time. We scheduled coffee for Thursday afternoon.

I wanted to thank you all again for the advice, especially the person who posted the love is respect website. I took the healthy relationship quiz after our conversation and it wasn’t great. You called out how he was weaning me into an unhealthy relationship so well.

For now, my friend said I can stay until I find a new place. I have emergency savings and a decent job, so I’m in a privileged place when it comes to this messy break up and am just trying to feel grateful for that

*Kinda sounds like everything she warned you about in the note came true. He had never cleaned there, he didn't listen to your concerns, and he turned it back around on you and somehow made it your fault. Red flag honestly.*



**Netlawyer**

*Any person who will leave food to mold on their dishes is not someone you want to live with. Family, roommate, bf/gf - that’s just a big no.*



**beatricky**

*On the plus side, could OP now leave a note for the NEXT girl to find, as the dirty (now ex) still won’t change?*



**CharlotteLucasOP**

*Steve might actually get off his ass and do a deep clean before he has another bangmaid over.*



**Mobius\_Stripping**

>he wouldn’t let me sleep until I let it go

*so i guess natalia forgot #4 - he’s a bully.*

*it’s almost ironic how easy it would have been for him to shut this entire thing down with the simplest of responses, “hmm, you’re right, i guess i have been slipping, i’ll make sure to clean more.” that immediately then counters points 2 & 3.*

*but he’d rather be right, and he’d rather be the aggrieved party.*

*you didn’t do anything wrong by trying to have a conversation off the back of that note, all things considered it’s a pretty funny thing to find, and his reaction should tell you everything.*



**Update - 1 day later**



As you can tell by my original post, I like to do things right away. It was definitely a mistake to bring him the note right away, but doing the things I did this morning right away was not a mistake as it allowed me to save my pets.

First, I want to respond to the comments saying I broke up a 2 year relationship over a note and chores. No, I broke up a 2 year relationship because when I tried to come up with solutions to an unequal situation, his response was to yell and try to convince me there was no problem except me. The final straw was when he physically blocked me from leaving the house after he was screaming at me. That is not okay and no one should stay with a man who responds to conflict like that.

The actual update: I wound up texting the post to Natalia last night and she thought it was great. She, like some of you, asked me about the pets. For context, one of the things Steve and I connected on was our love for little creatures. It's why I thought he was such a great guy, because if he could take such intricate care of his lizard, he could do the same with me. I was very wrong. He has one lizard he bought before me and then we bought 2 frogs together. I have a snake I brought with me when I moved in. I was planning on waiting until he cooled down to go grab my things and the frogs and snake, thinking he would never hurt them, but Natalia changed my mind. She said he could get destructive when he's mad and was concerned about the safety of my little guys. I immediately knew I couldn't wait until later this week and reached out for a meeting with the landlord for early this morning.

I wound up facetiming with Natalia last night and we had a long discussion. Natalia is a lawyer and told me that in our state, landlords are required to let me get out of the lease I signed in cases of domestic violence. She also told me that his yelling, gaslighting, and refusing to let me leave are all types of abuse. It's definitely hard for me to sit with that, but the love is respect relationship quiz helped me also realize that a bit more last night. Apparently his constant messaging and control over what I wore and when were signs of abuse too.

Anyway, this morning Natalia volunteered to come talk to the landlord with me alongside my brother. As soon as he heard the word lawyer, he was on top of it and said I could break the lease, but would still have to pay for all of August even though I'm leaving 3 days early. I felt like that was fair. He also messaged Steve to say the apartment needed to be empty for emergency maintenance all day today so I could pack my things. Steve messaged back that he was at work all day and wouldn't be home until 6pm.

When I got into the apartment, it was a mess. He had broken my dishes that I had brought with me on the ground and left the shards laying about. My clothes were ripped up and scattered around our room. It was disgusting and heartbreaking. He left his lizard alone, but opened the tank doors for our frogs and my snake. Luckily the frogs were still chilling in their enclosure, but my snake had gotten loose. This made me the most mad, as she could have gotten cut on the broken plates. I feel so fortunate that she was just hiding in the closet corner and I was able to pack her up safely in her enclosure again. All my things are packed and I'm writing this as my brother drives me back to my friend's house right now.

Natalia told me that she actually left 3 notes, one in the cabinet, one on the underside of the vacuum, and one in the crumb catcher of the toaster. While we were there, we checked to see if the notes were still there. The one on the vacuum was but it looks like Steve did clean out the crumb catcher at least once in the past 5 years. He never told me he had already found a note in our conversations, so it caught me by surprise.

Natalia and I left the vacuum note as is and replaced the cabinet one. I wasn't comfortable leaving my name on a new note, so my addition was a handout on healthy vs unhealthy relationships and a qr code to the quiz that woke me up. (I'll put it in the comments, I'm not sure if I can have an outside link)

Natalia said if he didn't find the notes in those 5 years, especially after the move, he probably won't find them again. I'm inclined to agree, especially given he did find one but then didn't even clean the rest of the house to see if there was anymore. Steve doesn't make sense to me and seeing the state of the apartment really woke me up to the fact that I have no idea who he is. The Steve I knew would never put animals in danger, but I don't think I really ever knew Steve.

To the people saying it's pathetic that I broke up my relationship because of chores and reddit, I encourage you to reflect on the subtle ways that abuse starts. This reddit thread woke me up to it and gave me the resources to get out safely before it got any worse.

I also made an appointment for a therapist. I'm very lucky that my job has good insurance so I should be able to work through this relationship and am hoping to focus on boundaries and my people pleasing habits so I never find myself in this situation again.

To the people wishing that Natalia and I would get together, we had a good laugh about it. Natalia is engaged to a wonderful man who cleans, listens, and reflects. She said there's a phenomenon that when people break up with their awful ex, their soulmate can quickly follow. I'm hoping that's true. Regardless, I do think I got a good friend out of this, especially since Natalia is a snake mom too.

This is my final update. I hope if you learn anything from my experience, it's that abuse doesn't start right away. First there's love bombing, gifts, and pretty words. And then slowly, they test how much you'll put up with. You should never have to put up with anything, especially moldy freaking plates.

TLDR: After ending things due to his behavior, Steve destroyed our apartment and let my snake loose, but I was able to get off the lease and get my things with Natalia's help. Now I am safe and am looking for a new place to live.

**One last update - 19 days later**



I haven’t posted in a while. I don’t know if anyone will see this, but I wanted to get it off my chest. I’m hoping this isn’t too rambling, I’ll go in chronological order.

When we went to his apartment, I took pictures of all the damage. Natalia told me I could press charges is I wanted. She couldn’t represent me due to conflict of interest, but that she’d find me someone good. I didn’t want to at first.

Then I saw a comment saying making a report can create a record that would help a potential future girlfriend be believed if something happened. Natalia saved me. I wanted to do the same. So a couple days later I pressed charges.

The police went to interview steve and the landlord. The destroyed apartment combined with police was enough for the landlord to evict him. So basically, by destroying my things, he destroyed his life.

I work as a physical therapist and my boss was nice enough to give me a week off after it all went down. I was able to find a new place, although it’s a bit more expensive. When I went back to work, Steve was parked in the parking lot.

I got out my phone and started recording just in case. My lawyer said to document everything. I wanted to walk into my building where I knew there were a bunch of people, and he was farther away, so in my adrenaline I thought I could make it without him catching up. I was wrong and he grabbed my hand when I was about 5 feet from the door.

At first he was soft spoken, he said he wanted to apologize but I hadn’t been responding to his calls. I said we’re done and to leave me alone and tried to get my hand free. That pissed him off and he pulled me tighter and started yelling that I ruined his life and that I owed him.

One of my coworkers came out at the commotion. He’s a big guy and a lot taller than Steve, who immediately backed up. I told him to leave and not bother me again and he left.

The video of that incident plus the security cameras from the past several days of him waiting in the parking lot when he knows my shift starts was enough for my lawyer to get a restraining order. He’s left me alone since then, took a plea deal, and he doesn’t know where my new place is so I think I’m finally in the clear.

I didn’t want to post until all of it was settled. I’m doing better now. I’ve had multiple therapy sessions. Natalia have hung out 3 times, and the last time Steve didn’t even come up. My workplace has rallied behind me and now I get walked by my co worker from my car to the door. I am so grateful for the support system that has rallied behind me. I wouldn’t have gotten through this without it. That includes all of the advice and support I got here.



**Update - 4 days later**



A hidden note from my boyfriend’s ex helped me get out of a bad relationship and now I have a restraining order One last update: I read this quote that said “many survivors have been motivated to heal by the courage of other survivors. Every time a survivor reveals her history to a friend, stands up in front of a group to tell her story, writes a book, or brings a lawsuit against abusers (or the institutions that allow abuse to occur), she inspires other survivors to break the silence.”

This stuck with me so much, especially after seeing the comments of people sharing their experiences or realizing that they needed to evaluate their relationship. So I wanted to post this here, just in case my story can help another person the way that Natalia and you all helped me.

*You did good, but please stay aware of your surroundings at all times, but especially at night. Your coworker won’t be close by when you go grocery shopping or to a mall. You got Steve evicted. You pressed charges. People like Steve may do ok short term but the restraining order will expire in 90 days or so. People like Steve can be very patient. If you aren’t inclined to go full martial arts, but please learn some basic self defense. Stay safe.*



**aerin104**

*Restraining orders can be ordered for different lengths. The one I had for my ex husband was ordered for 2 years automatically by the judge based on what he had done. Unfortunately during our divorce his lawyers did get it reduced but if he ever acts out again, I do have the history to show that it should be approved again.*

**Update - 15 months later**

&#x200B;

I doubt anyone still cares, but I remembered this account and wanted to give you all a final update. This whole situation changed my life, it was hard to go through but the advice I got helped me get safe and build what I have now. It gave me a new found appreciation for community and a lowkey addiction to this podcast lol

After my ex confronted me in the parking lot of my work, I didn’t feel safe and wound up moving after getting a job in another state around a month later. Everyone who said the worst man predates your soulmate was right.

I moved a block from a library and the librarian wound up asking me out. I was nervous at first but he seemed so sweet so we met up in a public location. We’ve been together since and I didn’t know it could be like this. He does the dishes anytime he’s over. The other day, I noticed I was almost out of granola, I internally added it to my list, only to find a new bag the next day. He noticed and just bought it unprompted. He cooks for me and still does the dishes after. He’s raised my standards and still insists he’s doing the bare minimum.

Raspberry is doing good. The move was stressful but she settled in and I got her an even bigger enclosure as a reward for surviving. My new man and her boop noses. I love it

Natalia and I will occasionally send TikTok’s to each other, that’s really the extent of it. I know a bunch of people wanted us to be besties (or even date lol) but unfortunately, we just remind each other of what we want to let go too much for that to happen

As for Steve, besides the temporary restraining order, not much more with me happened. I did contact the police about the destruction of my stuff, but the interactions with them and potentially having to see him in court made me drop it. It was probably only 500 in damages as that didn’t feel worth my mental health.

I did learn the landlord evicted him and was talking about suing for the property damage, as he had smashed some shelves and the sink (left his PC alone tho). He asked me for the pictures Natalia took directly after arriving and said he would try to use them. Last I heard, it was still ongoing.

I hate to say it, but the cops probably care more about the male landlord and his property damage than me and my clothes, plates, and snake. I wish him luck and hope he holds Steve accountable.

I have no idea if the notes are still there. I hope so, so that any future girlfriend finds them. Either way, I feel I did my part. Now it’s my time to heal and move on.

My last thing to say is that if anyone feels like their relationship is a slide, where you’re giving more than you get, slipping more and more into imbalance, talk about it. How they react will tell you everything.

*Thank you for taking the time to give us an update. Sounds like you found a keeper!*


**Dependent-Example295**

*Totally. I like how she didn’t frame it as some fairytale, just normal kindness and consideration. That’s what makes it feel real*

**dmKimber**

*Wait, if he's been evicted then it'll be some random person finding the notes right?
Unless you mean the one on the hoover?*


>OOP:
There is one taped to the bottom of his vacuum and one in the back of the cabinet of this big shelf he owns. He could have gotten rid of them when he was evicted, but I like to think they’re still there.




**jajsmother**

*He did not find the crumb catcher note, someone else found it. If he found it he would have confronted his ex- at that time, not wait until you showed him the 2nd note.*

Married, been together \~13 years, straight couple, not young (we were each born toward the end of the 1970s)  
  
My wife is a rock-solid civil rights person, like way deep in the trenches, works with the political action arm of reproductive rights groups and testifies in front of the state congress in her spare time while keeping up her job in a traditionally all-male blue-collar career environment, inspires the family to go volunteer on a reservation instead of eating turkey every thanksgiving, teaches other white women about intersectionality, just a badass.

But every so often she gets weeeeeeird talking about trans people. It puts my hackles way the fuck up and starts some near-arguments; I have always had nonbinary and trans friends and family. The love of my life veering even a \*little\* close to the TERF zone just sets of all my alarm bells. Worse, seeing me get visibly upset about it makes her wonder out loud why I'm so into trans people, anyway?? Just not a cool vibe. It's like she is extra jumpy because of all the times people have made assumptions about her as a woman who is outspoken and take-charge in social situations and who works in male-dominated spaces and lifts heavy at the gym with no regard to how 'feminine' she looks. She is just a woman who doesn't feel bound by other people's ideas of how women should be, that's all.

At the same time, the joke of the household is what a totally standard-issue straight guy I am; I *talk* like the encyclopedia of woke queerness but I *am* straight as a ruler and vanilla as an ice cream cone. It's a funny dichotomy. I am used to this joke and I get it; I was always the token straight boy in the theatre and modern dance spaces where I spent my teens and early 20s. 

I learned how to be firm but gentle in turning down come-ons from male friends and colleagues who thought I was cute or mistook my emotionally open friendship for something else, and after a while it didn't even make me feel confused and panicked. Hell, it would have been simpler if I \*was\* attracted to dudes, but alas I was only ever into lady parts. I had never even seen another man's penis up close, except for that one unasked for penis when I was a little kid, but I dealt with that according to the healthy standard of my generation by Never Mentioning It until I was like 30, and then talking about it as if it was no big deal because some people have real problems, you know? And I'm a privileged straight white dude, let's don't forget. I'm at peace with that, I'm just not attracted to dudes. Totally straight.

*You already know where this is going and you are correct*

Anyway: fast-forward years, for various reasons we allllll go to therapy. Couples therapy, individual therapy for both as well, it's lucky I have a well-paying Straight White Guy job with good insurance. 

The wife declares she thinks she is maybe nonbinary, and would it be ok if I try using they/them pronouns with her? I mean them? And of course it's ok and I will do that. Later it becomes more clear to them that nonbinary means they could still take T and get a lower voice, they've always felt like their voice was too high and sounded like someone who isn't them. That's not gonna be a problem right? I mean, to me - their husband - they carefully express that they believe I love them because they are *them* and not for how exactly they sound or if they dress feminine, right? Or if they have perhaps a little bottom growth as a result of the T, that's not even a big deal right? 

And no, it isn't. I confidently tell them that I am now and have always been in love with them, and even if I was to be shallow, I've always been attracted to sorta-masculine women so what's really different about this, anyway? They should stop worrying about me and make the choices that let them be more completely their real self. 

Am *I* worried about me? I mean, a little bit. My partner (not wife!) has said a bunch of times, they are not trying to identify as a 'man' and that they don't want to like grow a beard or *pass* or something, they are just trying more masculine presentation and hormones and all that because their sense of nonbinary identity is taking them there. But if they did want to present even more masculine, that would be ok right? 

What's the limit? There's a point where I can no longer hang? 

I don't think so. I confidently state that they have already told me they don't think of themselves as a *man* and I know I'm not hung up about specific body shapes or anything else like that, I just love my partner. I mean, I'm *straight* so there's some limit somewhere I guess, I just don't know where exactly. But it shouldn't be a problem.

Interesting thing about the T is that it causes some part of my partner to *click* into the fact that they are attracted to women. That has never been the case before.... that they could admit to themself, anyway; maybe they were hung up because they hated people making assumptions about them as a woman in male-dominated career spaces and hobbies. But it's too obvious to ignore now. Bisexual it seems!

Cool from my perspective; I wouldn't have predicted ""open relationship so my nonbinary partner can figure out a whole unexplored half of their sexuality"" as one of the possible futures we'd end up in together but I'm surprisingly ok with it. It's fun listening to my partner gush about dates with women, and how fascinating their bodies are (I agree wholeheartedly!)   
  
I have permission to be doing the same thing of course, I just am not prioritizing that right this second, my work is busy and anyway I'm not finding out something *new* if I find a woman to hook up with. I already know I like that lol

Would I ever touch a dick, my partner asks me? I mean: if you wanted to watch me do that because it'd be hot for you to watch, then I would go for it; I'm pretty game for most anything. Would I seek that out though? Naw, I'm straight.

Fast forward another few months - my partner is now post-top surgery, still on T but no longer taking the other one (that slows body hair and bottom growth), and is on a track toward 'passing' for male even if they keep identifying as transmasc non-binary. Oh, and they are *exclusively* attracted to women.   
  
Regretfully, we are breaking up.   
  
We don't hate each other's guts or anything, and I got to come along on a very weird and confusing-to-me-journey of finding myself more attracted to my partner as they got more masculine-presenting. Also because of the whole open relationship thing, even though I really wasn't actively looking, I must be putting out ""I'm single"" energy because I keep getting hit on in public. By both women and men, hilariously! Also, isn't it weird that one of those circumstances makes me feel warmly complementary, while the other one makes me feel butterflies and heart-pounding and kind of buzzy behind the eyes and grinning about something or other I don't understand myself? What's that about, anyway?

...

... ... ... ...

Oh geez. Wait, really?

,,,

I could write more paragraphs but in practice what's going down right now is me counting down the next couple of weeks until my lease starts on my new place, and my partner is going on dates with cute girls while I go on dates with cute boys. My almost-50-year-old former 'wife' is complaining about how chicks don't put any effort into messaging back on dating apps and the cost of buying coffee or cocktails while she gets to know some woman, and I'm learning how to talk to people differently on like Hinge or Tinder than on Grindr. And.... I dunno what next, story isn't done yet.  
  
Cheers and hope that was entertaining to some of y'all :)
