1ncd1vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFitnessIndia/comments/1ncd1vb/a_useful_resource_i_found_about_wellness_fitness/,A useful resource I found about wellness & fitness - Especially useful for beginners,"Hi folks! This is my second post here in one day but I am new to fitness and wellness and all that and it is very interesting. 

In my first post, I shared about how I find fitness to be super confusing as there's so much noise around it and it is the same story with wellness especially with all the chatter (read as hype) around matcha and how it is being positioned and marketed as a must have for wellness apart from a smart watch among many other things.   
I was scrolling through the net to understand stuff around wellness and after going through an INSANE number of articles, I found [this ](https://www.zivame.com/blog/v1/this-national-wellness-month-try-the-og-wellness-routine-not-matcha-or-coffee/)and it is helping me figure out what to prioritise as I begin my journey and find a starting point for myself. 

So basically fitness is a part of wellness but it isn't limited to fitness alone.

1ncd0yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1ncd0yh/he_took_me_engagement_ring_shopping_then_left_me/,He took me engagement ring shopping then left me three months after we moved in together. Does he sound like a narcissist or dismissive avoidant?,"We met on Bumble and fell in love fast and hard. We were basically inseparable after our first date. He was everything I dreamed of in a partner and best of all - he was intentional and sure about me too.

Hindsight looking back, there were certainly things that could have and maybe *should* have been red flags. He introduced me to his entire family in our second month of dating, for example, but the reasoning made sense: they live far away, and it was probably the only time I'd be able to meet them before his sisters wedding the following year. Or the fact he said I love you within one month. Or when he asked in month two if I'd want to move in with him the next year when his lease was up (he asked in December, the move happened in May) and I said yes.

He took me to get my ring size and then two separate times after that we went to look at engagement rings and try them on; he even tried on some wedding bands himself. In the moment though, with how right it all felt, it just made sense. It happens, right? Sometimes you just know when you've met the one. I knew it on our first date and months later when we talked about it, he said he knew it too.

I opened up to him about my past and my traumatic experience with being hurt by past partners - something I kind of had to explain because he did something truly innocent that triggered a panic attack in me. He held me and hugged me and said he understood, and reassured me about how safe I was with him.

We had some small arguments leading up to our move, but nothing crazy or extreme. We always communicated extremely well, I felt he was very emotionally intelligent, and we seemed to move past these issues with ease. Prior to signing the lease in April, I asked him again just to be sure, if he was sure he wanted to. He confidently and enthusiastically said yes, so we moved forward.

I had lived with my ex before him and although I ended it, uprooting my life and dividing everything up and moving out of our apartment was extremely difficult. I imagine it's somewhat what going through a divorce feels like and it was just terrible. He knew all of this in detail and he knew I was scared to do it again but willing to make the jump because of how good things were with us. I begged him to be honest because I never wanted to be put in the position of doing that again.

Almost immediately after the move, it was like he became a different person. The same guy who used to send me virtual gift cards for coffee on rough days, got me surprise flowers all the time, who literally used to run ahead of me to open my car door or would drop down in a millisecond to tie my shoe, who would constantly throughout the day text me little updates and cute memes and videos, who included me in everything as much as possible, suddenly didn't talk to me at all throughout the day and started making plans to hang out with friends alone. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm all for having time alone with friends - but he went from hardly ever doing that and pretty much always extending me an invite to join even if he knew I'd say no, to multiple times in a week going to meet up with a friend after work and coming home at like 8 or 9pm.

We ended up getting into two big fights, which I felt became way bigger than they needed to be, and he almost broke up with me both times. However, we fully made up and agreed to move forward.

So when we were out one day having a nice day together, literally laughing, kissing, saying I love you one hour and the next he was coldly and unemotionally breaking up with me in the middle of a restaurant - something in me truly broke. I've experienced bad breakups, I've been in love before, but nothing compares to this. We only lived together for three months!

The same man who wouldn't even jokingly say I was dumb, called me the c word and said he hated me a day after the breakup. Then a couple days after that, said I was the love of his life, one of the best people he's ever known, and his best friend. He even tried to ask me to remain friends.

He claims we argued too much and were incompatible. But then when I try to be as objective and honest with myself as possible, I still fully believe he was the one who sort of started the very issues he was apparently breaking up with me over. I also find it...extremely difficult to buy the ""we're incompatible"" excuse. We both actively don't want kids, I was fully willing to move around the country and world with him for his job every 2-3 years, we constantly had fun together, we had fantastic sex, similar views on politics, wanted similar lifestyles, agreed on how to spend money, he loves his motorcycle and I was happy to go on rides with him, every major thing you can think of that would be important was 100% aligned and so were so many smaller things.

I just don't know where to go from here. I've spent the last month ruminating and reading about difficult breakups and attachment styles and have come to the conclusion he fits the description for dismissive avoidant, but that doesn't take away the pain from how blindsided I feel. I fully believed he was my person and we were going to get married. I desperately want him to reach out but I haven't heard from him in over two weeks, close to three, and we've been no contact since then.

Tl;dr I feel like he stole the last bit of me that had hope there was someone out there for me. I can't (and don't want to) risk ever getting myself hurt like this again, it's just about the most devastating thing I've been through. I will admit too that while I don't feel the pressure that some people do to be married or settled down by a certain age, I'm 29 and so pretty much every close friend of mine is in a serious relationship.

• Great local coffee shops or spots to work from
• Social things to do solo where people are open to meeting new friends
• Fun classes, events, or hidden gems
• Neighborhood vibes I should experience while I’m there

Enjoy a solo trip for the independence and spontaneity plus tend to meet more people, staying careful in judgement of course. 

Anyway all been pretty similar experience and scenery wise, Agadir, Morocco probably being the personal favourite beautiful town and lots to do! Hurghada in Egypt was cold; in late March! But the best 1:1 designer style clothes I’ve ever seen 👀However though, during my week in Sousse/Port el Kantaoui in Tunisia I found the most amazing weather, a nice 35°c peak 😝 Lovely spots to roam about, the port in particular - some hidden gems to be discovered! 

As per expected some run down parts too, but didn’t do as much sightseeing or excursions etc as I usually would - will do on returning. The questionable characters were encountered also as they do anywhere on the planet. I did though meet and chill with some nice people, one of which being a gorgeous girl my age with whom I spent my last day there… (coffee, beach, dinner etc..). 

We also hired an apartment for a night at about 120 TND - £30 or so which albeit nothing to write a postcard about was banging value! Double room, open plan kitchenette/lounge, bathroom and balcony. Not to dive into too much detail but we only used it for 3 rather unforgettable hours, sadly cut a tad short as I had a flight to catch! 

We’ve spoken every day for the few months since said day, Which leads me to the point of wondering as there are hundreds of apartment buildings in the area what’s the average price of one? Not after all the bells and whistles I can do it up however I like and it’s only to have peace of mind knowing on a rainy boring day in Scotland I can jump on Skyscanner and be there by evening without having to book a hotel particularly in summer holiday season when it’s hard to find and crazy prices. 

All mere perks on getting to spend time with my lass out there and see where things go, we’ve been really sweet on each other since the night we met and become close. Preadolescent naivety taught me to be a very good judge of character and not to trust anyone too quickly so on that note I’m confident the connection is mutual and she’s not just after UK residency blah blah - we’re both students & we have discussed options and regulations on her visiting short term by partners invite etc, nor do either of us want a marriage. 

Any other short term stay visa options for Tunisian citizens visiting Britain is welcome ofc but primarily seeking price points for a small apartment and if anyone has property over there what was your experience like buying?

I have a Barista Express, purchased approx 2021.

It’s worked great so far, and had one service, and is cleaned as per the light. Recently it started pulling less coffee and the gauge struggled at point. I clean and descaled, this has lead to it pulling barely any water let alone coffee.

I have tried descaling and cleaning again (exposing a big burst of coffee) but has again only gotten worse.

Due to age it’s too expensive to get repaired, may as well upgrade, but if anyone knows a fix or how to inspect for a larger blockage the advise would be appreciated!

It gave the following reasons: 

1. Shiny Object Syndrome
	•	How I’d use it: I’d constantly dangle the newest business trends, tools, or startup ideas in front of them.
	•	Effect: Instead of focusing on executing their core vision, they’d keep pivoting and chasing “the next big thing,” never building momentum.

⸻

2. Overwork & Burnout
	•	How I’d use it: I’d whisper: “Real entrepreneurs never sleep. Grind harder, or you’ll fall behind.”
	•	Effect: They’d neglect rest, health, and relationships. Exhaustion would cloud judgment, leading to poor decisions and eventual collapse.

⸻

3. Comparison Trap
	•	How I’d use it: I’d flood their feed with success stories of peers raising millions, scaling fast, or living lavishly.
	•	Effect: Instead of measuring progress against their own goals, they’d feel inadequate, lose confidence, and waste energy copying others.

⸻

4. Perfectionism
	•	How I’d use it: I’d whisper: “Don’t launch until it’s flawless. One mistake will ruin you.”
	•	Effect: They’d spend months polishing, overthinking, and missing opportunities — while leaner competitors capture the market.

⸻

5. Toxic Networking
	•	How I’d use it: I’d connect them with charming but shallow people who promise partnerships, funding, or shortcuts.
	•	Effect: They’d waste time in endless coffee meetings, trapped in surface-level connections that never translate into real progress.

⸻

6. Fear of Failure
	•	How I’d use it: I’d remind them of every past mistake, magnify the risks, and make failure feel catastrophic.
	•	Effect: They’d play it safe, avoid bold moves, and miss the very risks that could lead to breakthrough success.

⸻

7. Endless Consumption, Little Action
	•	How I’d use it: I’d tempt them to binge on books, podcasts, and courses about entrepreneurship.
	•	Effect: They’d feel productive, but in reality, they’d be stuck in “learning mode” instead of executing. Paralysis by analysis.",1,1757404826.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

This might be a long one but I will try to make it short. I 'F 25' have been more than enough abusive relationships. Therefore, I try really hard to be rational when dating and look out for major red flags. When I do see a red flag I usually cut off the relationship or stop dating that person. I left an abusive relationship about  3 years ago (2022) around my birthday. The person I was seeing intended to wipe spit on me. And I had to beg him not too. Although, there are worse stories I could tell, the spit somehow was what made me leave.

Anyway fast forwarding to Summer of 2025, I thought I finally met the guy of my dreams. He was kind, or still is actually. He was sweet and charming. I never met a man who treated me so well before. He would get the car door for me most of the time and buy me dinners. Or sometimes he would bring me coffee while we were working together. As we got to know each other I thought he was so gentle. The age difference kinda freaked me out with him being 5 years younger than me but I thought he was really mature for his age. Eventually, we ended making things official and I thought this was it. Like I finally found the one.

Well tonight, once again, 3 days before my birthday me and my current boyfriend got into a major argument. I am not going to lie. I was yelling because I felt he was not understanding me. Eventually we came to an understanding and the fight sorta settled down. I attempted to lighten the mood and started to be playful with him and trying to make him feel loved. So i started rubbing his back and trying to tickle him in places that I usually do. And most of the time when I do that, he will be playful right back and tell me to stop, while we are both laughing. Well this time that was not the reaction and I am kinda freaking out. He grabbed my wrist so hard, that I was sorta speechless. HE never has done that before. Even right now as I am typing this my wrist is throbbing. He is asleep right now so thats how I am typing all this.

He did feel bad but he would follow up with you knew I was in emotional state, or he wouldnt of reacted that way if I never done that in the first place. These responses broke my heart. Because I genuinely thought he was different. I feel like a complete fool. Earlier that day we even talked about moving in together, now I am not even sure if I want to be with him anymore. I am scared to be alone. And I am wondering if I should tell my parents, break up with him, or just let it go?

TLDR

My boyfriend grabbed my wrist for the first time. Which came as surprise because never in a million years would I thought he would do this and not accept what he did. I am wondering what to do.",1,1757404710.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False

I (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) are dating for 3 months. He is from a broken family but not just a divorce very messed up things happened and he ended up growing with his grandmother. He was living in another city and moved here due to his work in a bank. At first his grandmother came with him for him to adjust then went back to her city. When his grandmother was around she was helping with housework. Ok not just helping she was doing the whole thing. And he was amazing when she was around. 

But when she went back he is always busy and cant even message back. He replys 2 or 3 hours late. We are in a same city but this city is huge and for me to go there its 2 hour long distance. So we can only meet in weekends in week days we chat a lot atleest we were chatting a lot. He is working in a bank 8am to 18pm and coming home doing houseworks. I am not expecting him to give me 2-3 hours in weekdays just 30 minutes is fine. Just to chat or play games etc. But he is not even doing that. We cant even meet in weekends anymore. He always expects me to come to meet him because he is so tired. Living together is not on the table because both of our parents are very religious.

And its not the only problem he is also swears at me a lot when he has problems. He was sharing his problem with me and i was trying to hype him but he doesnt like how i was hyping him (his problem was work related and i dont know how his job works so i was like ""we can just search for other places untill then hang in there i know u are strong!"") He started to call me names i dont know if i can say them in reddit i dont know the policies . And i said i am not ok with how he is acting and broke up with him after that he started to say that i am a heartless b word and i should just d!e. I blocked him everywhere but in social media he opened a new account and started to apologise and i was like maybe i handled it bad?he promised to not to do that again.

But it happened second time too. He was looking for a new phone and asked my opinion if he should buy a new phone. I first hyped him but he asked again and again so i gave him my honest opinion and said ""i think you shouldnt buy one your phone works perfectly and you should save your money in case some emergency happenes it can help you."" He doesnt like my answer and started to underestimate my intelligence and call me names again. I broke up with him again and i dont know how but he is talking up like he is using a magic with his words and i end up forgive him. So i forgave him again.

But i am at my limit. He is always having problems with his life. When i try to help him he always finds mistakes in how i help. He is mostly negative. He does not spend time with me. After this fight he does not even bought me a cheap flower. He always reply late. Our conversations are mostly negative and is about his life problems. And i dont want to underestimate his problems but if i should give examples its like even when they gave him wrong coffee he makes it like its end of the world. He is free to feel that way but i am tired. He always puts himself first and calls me selfish. In my brain i know i should break up but i am not trusting myself to not be manipulated again.

I also scared of being lonely and i also pity him for being alone in this city and no one to trust. His family is not his side and he does not have friends that much. His friends are in other city. So i kinda feel bad.

I also dont know if i loving him anymore my anger is just so big.

One trend that’s gaining attention is zero-click search. But what does it mean, and how can businesses grow without relying on Google referrals? Let’s break it down in simple terms and explore how you can adapt to this shift to boost your online presence.

https://preview.redd.it/6o3s6ar9g3of1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=f21486a1e2bd7a67e7f10b8f05cd5b96e17d92de

# What Is Zero-Click Search?

A zero-click search happens when someone searches for something on Google (or another search engine) and gets the answer right on the search results page without clicking through to a website. For example, when you search “weather today” or “capital of France,” Google often shows the answer in a featured snippet, knowledge panel, or quick answer box. No click, no website visit—just the info you need.

This is great for users but tricky for businesses and website owners who rely on Google referrals for traffic. If users aren’t clicking through, how do you get them to your site? Don’t worry—there are ways to thrive in this new landscape!

# Why Zero-Click Search Is Growing

Zero-click searches are becoming more common because search engines want to make things faster and easier for users. Here’s why this trend is picking up:

1. User Expectations: People want quick answers without digging through websites.
2. Featured Snippets: Google’s snippets, like quick facts or step-by-step guides, answer queries directly.
3. Mobile Usage: Most searches happen on mobile devices, where fast answers are key.
4. AI Advancements: Tools like AI chatbots and voice assistants (think Siri or Alexa) pull answers straight from search results.

As a result, studies show that over 50% of Google searches now end without a click. This means businesses need to rethink how they attract visitors and grow without depending solely on Google referrals.

# How to Grow Without Google Referrals

The rise of zero-click search doesn’t mean the end of website traffic. It just means you need to get creative. Here are practical, [SEO](https://hiphype.co/seo/)\-friendly strategies to grow your online presence:

# 1. Optimize for Featured Snippets

To win at zero-click search, aim to be the source of the answer Google displays. Featured snippets often come from well-structured content that directly answers a question. Here’s how to optimize:

* Use Question-Based Keywords: Target phrases like “how to,” “what is,” or “why does.” For example, “What is zero-click search?” could land you in a snippet.
* Clear, Concise Answers: Answer questions in 40–60 words at the start of your content.
* Use Headers and Lists: Break content into clear sections with H2 or H3 tags, like this blog does.
* Schema Markup: Add structured data to help search engines understand your content.

By ranking featured snippets, you gain visibility, even if users don’t click through right away.

# 2. Focus on Long-Tail Keywords

Long-tail keywords are specific phrases with lower competition, like “best ways to grow website traffic without Google.” These are less likely to trigger zero-click results because they’re more niche. Create detailed content around these keywords to attract users who are likely to click through for more information.

# 3. Build a Strong Brand Presence

When users see your brand in a zero-click search result, they may not visit your site immediately, but they’ll remember you. Strengthen your brand with:

* Social Media Engagement: Share valuable content on platforms like X, Instagram, or LinkedIn to build trust.
* [Email Marketing:](https://hiphype.co/email-marketing/) Collect emails through lead magnets (e.g., free guides) to drive traffic directly to your site.
* Consistent Branding: Use a memorable logo, tagline, and voice across all channels.

A strong brand makes users more likely to search for you directly, bypassing Google referrals altogether.

# 4. Leverage Other Traffic Sources

Don’t put all your eggs in Google’s basket. Diversify your traffic with:

* Social Media Platforms: Share engaging posts on X or TikTok to drive clicks to your site.
* Video Content: YouTube is the second-largest search engine. Create videos that answer common questions and link back to your site.
* Podcasts and Guest Posts: Appear on podcasts or write guest blogs to reach new audiences.

These channels help you grow without relying

# 5. Create Content That Encourages Clicks

Not every search ends in a zero-click result. Create content that makes users want to click through, like:

* In-Depth Guides: Offer detailed tutorials or case studies that go beyond what a snippet can cover.
* Interactive Tools: Build calculators, quizzes, or templates that require a visit to your site.
* Unique Insights: Share personal stories or data that users can’t find in a quick snippet.

For example, a blog titled “10 Proven Strategies to Boost Traffic Without Gamblers” could entice users to click for the full list.

# 6. Optimize for Voice Search

Voice search is a big driver of zero-click search. People using Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant often get answers read aloud from search results. To optimize for voice search:

* Use Natural Language: Write as if you’re answering a friend’s question.
* Target Local Keywords: Many voice searches are location-based, like “best coffee shop near me.”
* Keep It Conversational: Use simple, clear sentences that match how people talk.

# 7. Monitor Your Analytics

Track how zero-click search affects your traffic using tools like Google Analytics or Search Console. Look at:

* Impressions vs. Clicks: Are people seeing your content but not clicking?
* Keyword Performance: Which keywords are driving traffic, and which are stuck in zero-click results?
* User Behavior: Are visitors from other sources (like social media) staying longer on your site?

This data helps you tweak your strategy to focus on what works.

# The Future of Zero-Click Search

As search engines get smarter, zero-click search will only grow. Google and other platforms will keep prioritizing quick answers, especially with AI advancements. But this doesn’t mean businesses are doomed. By adapting to these changes, you can:

* Stay visible in featured snippets.
* Build traffic through alternative channels.
* Create content that’s too valuable to be summed up in a snippet.

The key is to focus on providing value and building relationships with your audience, whether they come from Google referrals or not.

# Conclusion

The rise of zero-click search is reshaping how businesses reach their audience, but it’s not the end of opportunity. By optimizing for featured snippets, targeting long-tail keywords, diversifying traffic sources, and creating click-worthy content, you can grow your online presence without relying on Google referrals. Embrace these strategies, stay user-focused, and adapt to the evolving search landscape to keep your business thriving.

One day, I couldn’t help it. I brought a cup of coffee and sat next to him. No collar, no tags. He leaned against me like we’d known each other forever.

That’s how I found out he was waiting for his human. An old man, who’d taken that bus every morning. According to the neighbors, the man had passed months ago. But the dog kept coming.

I started sitting with him every morning. Eventually, he started following me home. I didn’t need to ask if he wanted to stay.

I have been stuck maintaining between 160 - 170 for the longest time. I don't count calories just take care of my health in general. 

The one thing holding me back is my coffee habit. 3 cups in the morning, these days. 

I have 3 kids that get up super early in the morning. Ages 7, 5, and 1. So giving it up is not an option. 

Alternatives are not satisfying to me and I have tried quite a few over the years. In the end I always come back to my favorite creamer that is 35 calories a tbs. 

I decided to try orlistat/alli just with my coffee and not every meal like suggested to see if I lose any weight.

  
Orlistat blocks fat from being absorbed in your meal so you take it with your meal. There is fat in my creamer so I will update in a few weeks to see if it works! 

This isn't a lifelong habbit just a temporary one. I also tend to maintain a weight easily once I reach it so this is just to break through the stall. 

Eventually I won't rely on coffee as much but that day is not today. If you have little kids, especially a toddler, you know the struggle is real. 

  
Once that potty training kicks in I will be in a better place mentally. Then maybe I can give up a cup or two.



 I don't know if I will buy another bottle because it's a bit pricey, but since I am not using a full daily dose it should last me 3x as long. Sorry for rambling, there is a word count requirement.

If you’re like most coffee lovers, your heart might skip a beat at the thought of throwing away good coffee.**

But wait, before you toss those beans, consider this: expiration dates on coffee are more of a guideline than a hard rule. Curious about how long coffee beans actually last after the expiration date? You’re not alone. Many coffee enthusiasts wonder the same, eager to savor every last drop of their favorite brew.

Stick around, and you’ll discover the surprising truth about your beans’ longevity and learn how to make the most of your coffee stash. Your next perfect cup might be closer than you think.

# Shelf Life Of Coffee Beans

When you purchase coffee beans, you might not think about their expiration date right away. But understanding the shelf life of coffee beans can make a big difference in your coffee experience. Fresh beans can elevate your morning brew, while stale ones might leave you less satisfied.

# Factors Affecting Freshness

Several factors influence how long coffee beans stay fresh. **Storage**is key—beans kept in a cool, dark place last longer. Exposure to air, moisture, heat, and light can speed up the deterioration process.

The **roast level**also plays a role. Darker roasts may not last as long as lighter ones because they have more oils on the surface. These oils can become rancid over time, impacting flavor.

Consider the **packaging**too. Vacuum-sealed bags or those with one-way valves help maintain freshness by keeping out air. Have you checked how your beans are packaged?

Then, we met for the second time around after a couple of years din. He's still in Pampanga and I'm in Antipolo.

1nccezv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ProcedureNovel3663/comments/1nccezv/butter_in_coffee_benefits/,Butter in Coffee Benefits,"# Introduction

Over the past few years, adding butter to coffee has evolved from a surprising trend into a lifestyle choice embraced by health-conscious individuals. While it may seem unusual at first, this practice is rooted in nutritional science and offers a range of potential health benefits. By combining healthy fats with coffee’s natural energy-boosting properties, you can create a drink that supports focus, endurance, and overall wellness. Understanding the full scope of **butter in coffee benefits** can help you decide whether this creamy twist deserves a place in your morning routine.

# A Nutrient-Dense Energy Boost

One of the main reasons people turn to butter coffee is its ability to deliver sustained energy. Unlike traditional creamers or sweeteners that can spike your blood sugar, butter provides healthy fats that are metabolized more slowly. These fats act as a steady fuel source for the body and brain, preventing the energy crashes often associated with high-carb breakfasts. As a result, many people experience improved alertness and mental clarity throughout the morning.

# Enhances Mental Focus and Clarity

Caffeine is well-known for boosting concentration, but pairing it with butter can enhance its effects. Healthy fats in butter help slow the absorption of caffeine, which means you get a smoother, longer-lasting boost without the jitters or sudden crashes. This steady release of energy can improve focus and cognitive performance, making butter coffee an attractive option for those with demanding work schedules or creative projects.

# Supports Ketogenic and Low-Carb Lifestyles

For individuals following ketogenic or low-carbohydrate diets, **butter in coffee benefits** extend far beyond taste and energy. Butter is a natural source of saturated fats, which play a crucial role in maintaining ketosis — a metabolic state where the body burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. By incorporating butter into your coffee, you can increase your fat intake while keeping carbs low, making it easier to stay within your dietary goals.

# Promotes Satiety and Weight Management

One of the most notable **butter in coffee benefits** is its impact on satiety. Healthy fats are more filling than carbohydrates, which means starting your day with butter coffee can help curb mid-morning hunger and reduce overall calorie intake. When paired with a balanced diet, this can support weight management and minimize unhealthy snacking throughout the day.

# May Improve Metabolism and Fat Burning

Adding butter to coffee has been linked to improved metabolism, especially for individuals practicing intermittent fasting or low-carb eating. Healthy fats help train the body to become more efficient at burning stored fat for energy. For those looking to enhance fat loss while maintaining stable energy levels, butter coffee can be a valuable tool.

# Rich Source of Healthy Fats and Nutrients

High-quality butter provides essential nutrients that contribute to overall health. It contains fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K, which support everything from immune function to bone strength. The healthy saturated fats in butter also play a role in hormone regulation and brain health. By combining butter with coffee, you get more than just an energy boost — you give your body important building blocks for wellness.

# Helps Maintain Stable Blood Sugar Levels

Unlike sugary creamers or flavored syrups, butter doesn’t cause blood sugar spikes. By keeping glucose levels stable, butter coffee can help prevent the energy crashes and cravings that often follow high-carb breakfasts. This makes it a particularly beneficial choice for those managing insulin sensitivity or looking to improve metabolic health.

# Enhances Athletic Performance and Endurance

For athletes and fitness enthusiasts, **butter in coffee benefits** can translate into improved performance. The healthy fats provide a slow-burning energy source, which can be especially valuable during long workouts or endurance training. Combined with caffeine’s natural ability to enhance alertness and physical stamina, butter coffee offers a powerful pre-workout option.

# May Support Brain Health and Longevity

Healthy fats, including those found in butter, are vital for brain health. They help build and protect cell membranes, promote neurotransmitter function, and support long-term cognitive performance. When combined with the antioxidants naturally present in coffee, butter coffee becomes a brain-friendly beverage that may contribute to mental sharpness and long-term neurological health.

# Encourages Mindful Consumption

Another unexpected benefit of butter coffee is the way it encourages mindfulness around eating habits. Because it’s rich, satisfying, and filling, it naturally slows you down and reduces the tendency to overconsume. By starting your day with a drink that promotes satiety and focus, you set the tone for making more intentional choices throughout the day.

# Potential Considerations and Moderation

While the benefits are appealing, it’s important to enjoy butter coffee in moderation. Excessive saturated fat intake can be problematic for some individuals, especially those with certain heart health concerns. Choosing high-quality butter and balancing your overall diet ensures you gain the positive aspects of this practice without overdoing it. As with any dietary change, listening to your body and consulting with a healthcare professional can help you decide if butter coffee is right for you.

# Conclusion

From improved energy and mental clarity to better satiety and metabolic support, the **butter in coffee benefits** are diverse and compelling. By combining the stimulating effects of caffeine with the sustaining power of healthy fats, butter coffee creates a balanced and nourishing start to your day. Whether you’re following a low-carb lifestyle, seeking better focus, or simply experimenting with new wellness habits, butter coffee offers a simple yet powerful way to elevate your morning routine. Moderation and quality remain key, but when approached thoughtfully, this creamy twist on your daily brew can be a game-changer.

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The **Orix Buffaloes** are the overwhelming favorites here, with moneyline odds ranging from **1.44 to 1.52** (implied probability: **69–70%**). The **Chiba Lotte Marines**, meanwhile, sit at **2.5–2.8** (implied **36–40%**), a team clearly seen as a fading force. The spread reflects this: Orix is favored by **1.5 runs**, with odds between **1.83–1.95**, while the total runs line is locked at **6.5**, with even money on over/under.

But here’s the twist: Lotte’s pitcher, **Mi Ma**, is throwing his final career game. His 2024 stats? A 0-6 record, 3.94 ERA, and a body that’s been “redecorated” by elbow and knee injuries. Orix’s starter, **Daichi Miyagi**, is younger (24 vs. 38), fresher (six days’ rest), and claims to feel “normal” despite throwing 121 pitches in his last start. The numbers scream: *This is a pitcher’s duel, not a fireworks show.*

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Retirements, and Almost-No-Hitters

Lotte’s emotional farewell for Mi Ma is sweet but strategically concerning. A retiring pitcher with “daily pain” and zero wins last season? It’s like sending a broken toaster into a bread-making competition. As for Orix, their recent loss to Lotte (2-4) was a textbook case of *hitting the wall*: 11 hits, two runs. Their offense is a Toyota Corolla in a Formula 1 race—*well-intentioned, but not built for speed*.

Meanwhile, Orix’s Miyagi is a “mystery box” after a six-day layoff. He says he’s ready, but let’s be real: Six days is the MLB equivalent of a coffee

1ncccgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ncccgh/he_29m_took_me_29f_ring_shopping_twiceand_then/,He (29M) took me (29F) ring shopping twice...and then left three months after we moved in together,"We met on Bumble and fell in love fast and hard. We were basically inseparable after our first date. He was everything I dreamed of in a partner and best of all - he was intentional and sure about me too.

Hindsight looking back, there were certainly things that could have and maybe *should* have been red flags. He introduced me to his entire family in our second month of dating, for example, but the reasoning made sense: they live far away, and it was probably the only time I'd be able to meet them before his sisters wedding the following year. Or the fact he said I love you within one month. Or when he asked in month two if I'd want to move in with him the next year when his lease was up (he asked in December, the move happened in May) and I said yes.

He took me to get my ring size and then two separate times after that we went to look at engagement rings and try them on; he even tried on some wedding bands himself.

In the moment though, with how right it all felt, it just made sense. It happens, right? Sometimes you just know when you've met the one. I knew it on our first date and months later when we talked about it, he said he knew it too.

I opened up to him about my past and my traumatic experience with being abused - something I kind of had to explain because he did something truly innocent that triggered a panic attack in me. He held me and hugged me and said he understood, and reassured me about how safe I was with him.

We had some small arguments leading up to our move, but nothing crazy or extreme. We always communicated extremely well, I felt he was very emotionally intelligent, and we seemed to move past these issues with ease. Prior to signing the lease in April, I asked him again just to be sure, if he was sure he wanted to. He confidently and enthusiastically said yes, so we moved forward.

I had lived with my ex before him and although I ended it, uprooting my life and dividing everything up and moving out of our apartment was extremely difficult. I imagine it's somewhat what going through a divorce feels like and it was just terrible. He knew all of this in detail and he knew I was scared to do it again but willing to make the jump because of how good things were with us. I begged him to be honest because I never wanted to be put in the position of doing that again.

Almost immediately after the move, it was like he became a different person. The same guy who used to send me virtual gift cards for coffee on rough days, got me surprise flowers all the time, who literally used to run ahead of me to open my car door or would drop down in a millisecond to tie my shoe, who would constantly throughout the day text me little updates and cute memes and videos, who included me in everything as much as possible, suddenly didn't talk to me at all throughout the day and started making plans to hang out with friends alone. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm all for having time alone with friends - but he went from hardly ever doing that and pretty much always extending me an invite to join even if he knew I'd say no, to multiple times in a week going to meet up with a friend after work and coming home at like 8 or 9pm.

We ended up getting into two big fights, which I felt became way bigger than they needed to be, and he almost broke up with me both times. However, we fully made up and agreed to move forward.

So when we were out one day having a nice day together, literally laughing, kissing, saying I love you one hour and the next he was coldly and unemotionally breaking up with me in the middle of a restaurant - something in me truly broke. I've experienced bad breakups, I've been in love before, but nothing compares to this. We only lived together for three months!

The same man who wouldn't even jokingly say I was dumb, called me a c\*nt and said he hated me a day after the breakup. Then a couple days after that, said I was the love of his life, one of the best people he's ever known, and his best friend. He even tried to ask me to remain friends.

He claims we argued too much and were incompatible. But then when I try to be as objective and honest with myself as possible, I still fully believe he was the one who sort of started the very issues he was apparently breaking up with me over. I also find it...extremely difficult to buy the ""we're incompatible"" excuse. We both actively don't want kids, I was fully willing to move around the country and world with him for his job every 2-3 years, we constantly had fun together, we had fantastic sex, similar views on politics, wanted similar lifestyles, agreed on how to spend money, he loves his motorcycle and I was happy to go on rides with him, every major thing you can think of that would be important was 100% aligned and so were so many smaller things.

I just don't know where to go from here. I've spent the last month ruminating and reading about difficult breakups and attachment styles and have come to the conclusion he fits the description for dismissive avoidant, but that doesn't take away the pain from how blindsided I feel. I fully believed he was my person and we were going to get married.

Tl;dr I feel like he stole the last bit of me that had hope there was someone out there for me. I can't (and don't want to) risk ever getting myself hurt like this again, it's just about the most devastating thing I've been through. I will admit too that while I don't feel the pressure that some people do to be married or settled down by a certain age, I'm 29 and so pretty much every close friend of mine is in a serious relationship.

However, I've learned that i'm pissed as hell with the relationships in my life.  Caffeine and sugar evidently have flattened out and suppressed my emotional awareness.

1nccbyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nccbyu/aitah_confronting_my_boyfriend_about_money/,AITAH: confronting my boyfriend about money imbalances in our relationship,"I confronted my boyfriend about the fact that most times I end up paying for our outings, that he suggests. In the beginning of the relationship (1year) he expressed being tight on money currently. I told him we dont need to do expensive things, I am happy being at home.

His response to confrontation :

He said he suggested all these outings to make me happy and keep me from being bored at home.

He said his money is “always offered,” as his wallet is always with us (usually i carry it in my bag) and i could have reached for it any time to pay. He never once said he “forgot” his wallet or something of the sort to avoid paying.

He said ,now, every nice gesture I’ve done is “cancelled” because my “heart wasn’t in it,” and called me stingy — as I’ve made an invoice of every dinner.

He said i should had talked about this bothering me sooner, insinuating its my fault it happened so many times. I just told him about it he would’ve stopped and he said from now on he will pay for everything.

He said “its easier to just pay with ur apple pay, instead of me looking for cash”. thats why many times he suggested i pay. out of boredom of looking for his cash

He said he doesn’t even buy boxers or new clothes ( that he is in need of) because he wants to spend all his money for us. ( meanwhile he got a tattoo and expensive jewellery in the same week equal to 1k+). he said he wanted to to something nice for himself - sure. 

What’s confusing me:

He did pay for stuff and dinners, and has made effort. he also bought me roses. He got me some gold earrings and a gold bracelet. (he pointed out they were expensive, isnt that weird?) 

I personally dont really care about gifts, but i appreciate the gesture

Also according to him he has spent a lot on money on me too in regards to us seeing each other as we are long distance (which i acknowledge, but so have I) . however, he did admit that for our outings i have paid more.  

My concerns:

I tried to explain this is not about the money or who paid for what and how many times. if I look for my wallet a little bit longer or my card is not working then he will end up paying.

The behaviour that upset me is that we always order food at home from my account! So automatically I pay for it. One time I asked him to go pick up the food and he stopped and said “ ok but give me your card” (I had already paid, but he forgot).

Few other times when we are paying the bill, he was like just use your card. I can’t be asked to look for my wallet. “

Other times when bill comes , he straight up asked me “ have u got it”?

Other times we are having dinner in an expensive restaurant and he ordered so many things and at the end he doesn’t even offer to pay. he doesn’t say anything or asks of i got it.

Another time that really bothered me is this - we were about to pay and he did offer to pay, as did I. Now, he only has cash and I only had my card. The waiter was like “oh for card we will need to wait a minute” and instantly he was like “okay we’ll wait”.

Another time he ordered coffee and left and said “ im going to smoke, get the bill, while i am at it. He then called me stingy for complaining that I paid for “just coffee. 

Another time he wanted to drive me to a supermarket to get cigarettes for his mom.  before we got on his bike he said “ have you got ur card ready “? then as we arrived he said “ oh buy one pack for me too” 


IDK. i feel conflicted as theres been some effort. he did apologise too.  I feel weird now about bringing it up. He now suggests that i put lots of value in my pocket and on money

i feel put off and he wants another chance, as we “talked through it” and from now on he will pay for everything ( i don’t want that its weird).

I will definitely be forgetting sometime, but I havent yet! I've just had long stretches of busy time, like cleaning the entire floor of our business tonight heheh.

  
Anyways, remember how I said I would be eating estrogen without food again? Well, i did.. and because im really smart I then proceeded to brew and drink coffee (which is one of the worst things you can do when you have nothing else with medicine). my stummy hurted... but not too terribly

While working on the floor I mentioned not eating to my Dad, and he asked ""Are you taking any medicine that makes you not hungry?"" Which means he suspects, or at least it crossed his mind, that I may be on medication. So perhaps that time I left the E at my desk he saw it...... But perhaps not ✨so... yeah T-T

I also had 2 proper(ish) meals today again! 

I've been thinking about the guy I met yesterday, at the birthday party, and.. When I asked his pronouns, he said ""hi/him....."" and then, ""i know I dont look it haha"" He *did* look it more than he thinks, enough I asked at the very least (which is waht i said heheh) but since he lives with his conservative family, he got misgendered quite a bit while his brother was playing with us (chasing us with a nerf gun). It was really weird, and felt really wrong, hearing people refer to him as ""she"". Like, it just felt off... I guess I never really had that experience, because of not knowing many trans people irl, but yeah. I dont really know where I'm going with this.. except ig, misgendering feels weird even if the person doesnt fully pass, and also you probably look better than you think. 

Anyways, I'm as always super eepy, so goodnight ya'll! Drink water pleaaseeee thank youu *headpats*

1ncc2g7,https://i.redd.it/3q3w0pqn73of1.png,What's your biggest 'I should have filtered this water' regret story?,"I was thinking about how we all ended up with our current water filter setups, and it got me curious about those moments that made us realize we actually needed better filtration.

**My story:** Our tap water wasn't terrible, but it had this slight metallic taste that I just got used to over time. I kept thinking about getting an under sink RO system but never got around to it. The real wake-up call came during a family dinner when my mother-in-law made a comment about how our water tasted ""off"" and asked if we had any bottled water instead. 

Finally installed one several months ago, and it's made more of a difference than I expected: 

* My morning coffee actually tastes like coffee now instead of having that underlying metallic flavor
* When I make pasta or rice, **food comes out better** because there's no chlorine taste affecting it
* **My ice cubes are clearer** and don't have that cloudy look they used to get

The funny thing is, I didn't realize how much I was just tolerating bad water until I had something to compare it to. I kept telling myself our water was ""fine"" when it really wasn't.

What about your experience? I'm curious about what made you decide to get serious about water filtration. Maybe you: 

1. Got tired of **water that didn't taste right** but you lived with it
2. Had **guests comment** on your water quality
3. Noticed your **appliances getting mineral buildup faster** than they should
4. Kept putting off upgrading your basic filter to something better
5. Discovered your **water had issues** you didn't know about
6. Finally **tried really good filtered water** somewhere and realized what you were missing
7. Had **problems with cooking or drinks** that you traced back to water quality

A few replies, maybe a casual coffee plan. But 130 responses later, it became clear—there’s a deeper need here. Not just for meetups, but for **meaningful connection**.

So I created *The 27-32 Circle* with a simple but powerful idea:  
To build a space where people aged 27–32 in Pune can find **real friendships**, not just fleeting interactions.

We’re at a life stage where conversations matter more than selfies, where shared silence can be more comforting than loud parties. Many of us are navigating careers, relationships, identity, and growth—and we’re doing it without the social scaffolding we once had in college or early work life.

💬 Why this matters now:

At this stage of life, many of us feel a quiet kind of loneliness.

* Our college friends are in different cities or countries
* Some are married, busy with new responsibilities
* Others have simply drifted apart over time
* Work takes up most of our week, and weekends feel empty
* Random meetups often feel shallow or mismatched
* Making new friends as an adult is hard—and awkward

We’re not looking for noise. We’re looking for **belonging**.

This community is my attempt to rebuild that scaffolding—intentionally.

💬 What I envision:

* A space where people feel safe being themselves
* Small, curated meetups designed to know each other and make friends
* Conversations that go beyond “What do you do?”
* A bond that grows slowly, organically, and with emotional depth
* A community that values sincerity over popularity, and presence over performance

Whether you’re here to find your chai buddy, your trek partner, or just someone to talk to after a long day—this space is yours.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1ncbzsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ncbzsb/got_reconnected_with_my_eight_grade_crush/,Got reconnected with my eight grade crush,"Back in eighth grade, I had the biggest crush on this boy. He was cute, shy, and had the most gorgeous smile. I was the tallest girl in class and he was quite short, but somehow, I found his height endearing. We shared the same sense of humor, and I loved making him laugh, his smile and quiet demeanor would quite literally, light up my day. 

Looking back, he was my very first “puppy love” the kind of crush that made middle school girls go crazy. While most girls were swooning over the tall, handsome jocks, I fell for the quiet, funny loner sitting at the back of the room. We became friends cuz he was also interested in arts and he and I would have art dates with our other friends where we would draw together.

After eighth grade, we went our separate ways, but somehow I managed to sustain that crush for another two or three years. I’d even stalk him on social media from time to time, it was that obsessive. 

Fast forward eight years, life simply happened. I grew up, discovered who I was, developed my own passions, and became my own person. My eighth grade crush became nothing more than just a fond memory of my childhood. 

Then, out of nowhere, we became mutuals on Instagram. He was still the same but also… different.  but I felt like he and I weren’t on the same level anymore. 

He started noticing my art and would occasionally leave comments praising my illustrations. One day, he told me I had inspired him to be a creative himself. We eventually caught up in person over coffee, shared a few jokes and laughed the whole time we were together (as if this was not our first contact after 8 whole years)

Since then we’ve been talking nonstop, even sharing reels like we were old friends. (When we just had a couple interactions before lol)

It’s funny to think that 14-year-old me would’ve KILLED for a moment like this. She prayed and begged for an opportunity like this. 
But now, as an adult, I can just smile at the irony of it all and how life has a way of circling back. ",3,1757401033.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I am someone who likes more tea like brews.  
  
Right now I'm brewing an Guatemalan gesha (medium light) fully washed from a local roaster. Im brewing at 96**°**c. with a 1:17 ratio at around 750 microns. The coffee is only about 3 days after roast. I took some inspiration from the 4:6 recipe, Hoffman recipe and the recipe that Lance Hedrick uses.

I drink only medium light and light roasts.

brewing with Origami 

0:00 - 1:15 : 60g bloom (Until coffee degassed depending on days from roast)  
1:15 - 1:35 : 40g - circular pour (5 g/s flow rate, finish pour under 10 sec and wait 10 sec before pouring)  
1:35 - end : 150g - center pour ( 7-8 g/s flow rate)  
Finish with a swirl of the slurry.  
Total brew time should be around 3 mins 

1st bloom time is quite long as Im brewing a very fresh coffee that's only had 3 days to rest after roast.

The 2nd pour I only add when I'm brewing light roast coffees or I feel like I want more body.

3rd pour flow rate for me depends on the process and roast level.  
3 - 4 g/s : anaerobics/fermentation stuffs   5 - 6 g/s : naturals  7 - 8 g/s : washed

Here's a mini tldr for the most important stuff.

- You find ammos in the world, and based on we know the gun won't have a lot of capacity.

I have a Moka Pot and enjoyed James Hoffmann’s videos on using one. 

But I have a question. When the coffee starts to flow out the spout, I’m supposed to turn it as low as possible to slow tbe pace of the flow. Right?

I’ve got it to the point where I can get a very slow but continuous flow, but it takes about 5-6 minutes from start of flow to full (barely any sputtering).

Is that too long? 

Also, yesterday I measured water in and out. The boiler started with 215g of water and finished with 36g of water. Is that a useful measurement?

I am looking for someone to be with or talk to, particularly a dinner date later or tomorrow after office, masyadong stressful na ang life, just wanna unwind and relax. Also looking for genuine connections. Willing to listen to your rants about life. You will know someone kapag makakasama mo rather than virtual. We build connections first before we meet because I do respect everyone's POV when it comes to meeting someone online. For your own safety lang rin. Tsaka para walang regrets. Let's just be true to each other para di sayang ang oras natin. 

A short background about me: I am from Sta Mesa, Manila, 5'7"", M, have high respect with woman, medyo chubby, knows how to respect boundaries and privacy, emotionally intelligent, working professional (legal field), INFP, Moreno, matangos ilong, nakasalamin, mabait. I do not demand time. If you are busy, then do your thing. I am not a type of person who will seek attention. I will update you most of the time but you are not required to do the same. In short, di mo kailangan gawin yung bagay na hindi naman ikaw, just act naturally. 

What am I looking here? I am just looking for someone genuine. Yung totoo. Basta let's be comfortable with each other. I never wanted someone to be creeped out. I am not a catfish, kung ano ako, yun ang sasabihin at ipapakita ko. Pero if you'll ask a preference, shorter than me, normal build, working professional, may time kahit twice a week or at least an hour a day, yung personality naman basta totoo ka, ipakita mo kung ano at sino ka. I can manage naman. Normal din naman sa babae ang pagiging moody, I can handle moodswings.

Where do we go on our first meet? Coffee shop even if I am not allowed for coffee (acidic) for your peace of mind or have lunch or dinner, do firing, watch move, travel, swim, city lights, or anything that we can bond with.

If we will be having a dinner date, we can eat somewhere in Manila or QC.

This is for someone who is will to have a date.  Not a fan of chat or virtual connections, my apologies!

3. **OnePlus** – Super lightweight and comfortable, which makes them easy to wear for long hours without ear fatigue.

In recent years, there’s been a growing interest in adding butter in coffee, a trend that has sparked curiosity among health enthusiasts, coffee lovers, and anyone seeking to upgrade their morning ritual. While it might sound unusual at first, this practice blends the comforting richness of butter with the energizing qualities of coffee to create a unique beverage that delivers both flavor and function. From sustained energy to improved mental clarity, butter in coffee has become a staple for many seeking a powerful start to their day.

# The Origin of Butter in Coffee

The concept of putting butter in coffee isn’t as modern as it seems. Cultures around the world have incorporated butter or similar fats into hot beverages for centuries. Tibetan yak butter tea, for example, has been enjoyed for hundreds of years by those living in high altitudes where dense calories and slow-burning energy are essential for survival. Today’s trend borrows from this tradition but gives it a modern spin, pairing coffee’s natural caffeine boost with the slow-release energy of healthy fats.

# Why People Are Adding Butter in Coffee

One of the main reasons people choose to put butter in coffee is for its unique combination of taste and functionality. Beyond just a rich and creamy texture, the blend of butter and coffee provides a sustained source of energy, mental clarity, and overall wellness benefits that a plain cup of coffee can’t always deliver.

# A Boost of Sustained Energy

Unlike regular coffee, which can cause quick spikes and crashes in energy levels, butter in coffee creates a smoother, longer-lasting boost. The healthy fats in butter slow down the absorption of caffeine, giving you steady energy throughout the morning instead of the jitters and crashes that come from drinking coffee alone.

# Enhanced Mental Focus

Butter contains compounds like butyrate and other fatty acids that support brain function. Combined with caffeine’s natural ability to improve alertness, this creates a powerful synergy. Many people report sharper focus, improved concentration, and a greater sense of mental clarity when starting their day with butter in coffee.

# Supports a Low-Carb or Keto Lifestyle

For those following a ketogenic or low-carb lifestyle, butter in coffee fits perfectly. By replacing sugar and milk with healthy fats, you avoid blood sugar spikes while encouraging your body to stay in fat-burning mode. This makes butter in coffee a natural fit for anyone prioritizing metabolic health.

# The Nutritional Benefits of Butter in Coffee

Butter is more than just a source of fat—it’s rich in vitamins and compounds that can support your overall health when consumed in moderation. When combined with coffee, these benefits are amplified, creating a drink that fuels both body and mind.

# Rich in Healthy Fats

Grass-fed butter, often used in butter coffee recipes, contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fats are quickly metabolized into energy, helping fuel your day without relying on carbohydrates.

# Packed with Fat-Soluble Vitamins

Butter is a natural source of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. These vitamins play crucial roles in immune function, bone health, and skin vitality. Starting your day with butter in coffee can help provide these essential nutrients while supporting overall wellness.

# Antioxidant Power from Coffee

Coffee is already loaded with antioxidants that fight free radicals and inflammation. When combined with butter’s nutrient profile, the result is a beverage that nourishes your body while energizing your mind.

# How Butter in Coffee Affects Your Morning Routine

Switching to butter in coffee can change the way you experience mornings. Many who make the switch find that they feel fuller longer, snack less throughout the day, and enjoy a more stable mood and energy pattern. The slow-digesting fats create a feeling of satiety that can carry you through until lunchtime, making it a great option for those practicing intermittent fasting.

# Potential Downsides and Things to Consider

While butter in coffee offers numerous benefits, it’s not for everyone. Because butter is high in calories and saturated fat, portion control is important. Those with certain dietary restrictions or heart health concerns should consult with a healthcare provider before making butter in coffee a daily habit. Moderation remains key to enjoying the benefits without overloading your diet with unnecessary calories.

# Tips for Making Butter in Coffee

Making butter in coffee is simple but requires a little technique to get the best texture and flavor:

·         **Use high-quality butter** – Opt for grass-fed butter for its superior nutrient profile.

·         **Blend it well** – Use a blender or frother to emulsify the butter into the coffee, creating a creamy, latte-like texture.

·         **Experiment with add-ins** – Some people enhance their butter coffee with cinnamon, collagen, or MCT oil for an extra health boost.

# Butter in Coffee vs. Traditional Coffee

Traditional coffee is loved for its quick caffeine boost, but butter in coffee offers a different experience. By combining caffeine with healthy fats, you create a slower, more balanced release of energy. This makes it especially appealing for busy professionals, athletes, and anyone looking to improve productivity without sacrificing health.

# Who Should Try Butter in Coffee

Butter in coffee can be a great option for:

·         Those following low-carb or keto diets

·         People looking for sustained energy without sugar crashes

·         Individuals practicing intermittent fasting

·         Professionals and students seeking improved focus and productivity

However, it’s always wise to listen to your body and evaluate how it responds to dietary changes.

# Conclusion

Butter in coffee is more than just a trendy beverage—it’s a blend of tradition, nutrition, and modern wellness. By combining the rich, creamy texture of butter with the energizing effects of coffee, you create a powerful drink that fuels both your body and mind. From steady energy and enhanced focus to support for low-carb lifestyles, butter in coffee offers a unique way to upgrade your morning routine.

If you’ve been curious about trying butter in coffee, start small and see how it fits into your lifestyle. With the right balance, it can be a delicious and functional addition to your daily habits, helping you feel more energized, focused, and ready to take on the day.

Wala tawo pagkadto ko, ako lang customer. G na g man ang mga barrista sa pag take sang order ko. Dasig ang service, medjo lapad ang place. Damo food and drink options.

🍵 THE MATCHA 🍵

2nd day in a row that I have been cursed with bitter matcha, but this time, di ko gid ya bet. Super grassy, medjo chalky biskan ako ko nga stir. Watery man siya. Wala sila nagask if sweetened or not, so I assumed nga maybe pre-sweetened na siya pero nope, it'll hit you straight in the face. Wala ko naubos, wala ko gani na 1/3 kay indi gid ya giving for me.

🍳 THE FOOD 🍳

May rice meals, pasta, sandwiches, and cookies sila. I had the sausage rice meal with egg. Mahal siya TBH 220 for 1 sausage, rice, and 2 eggs. Di ko man mayo bet ang sausage kay ka asin so wala ko man naubos.

❗️OVERALL REVIEW ❗️

If sweet matcha enthusiast ka, this isn't for you. Won't have their matcha again but will most likely come back for the coffee since I've heard a lot of good things about their coffee. Foodwise, depende na na sinyo pero for me, wala ko mayo nasatisfy. Nami vibes sang place though, nami man playlist nila.

Amo lang na, sa dason naman nga matcha (which is literally the next post after this 😅) 🫶🏽",5,1757400306.0,Bacolod,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I don't feel well. So many horrible things have happened to me in the past that I can't even describe them. I thought I'd been treated, but it's back again, and I'm so scared, even though I know it's absurd, but I'm unable to control this. It's like I have a knot that pops and I cry randomly. I'm a mess. It's like when you're physically sick and you can't control your body. That's how I feel, but with my mind, breathing exercises and reasoning don't matter. My body just reacts with instincts and feelings that come up and I can't control them. I've even vomited and hurt myself without really meaning to. It's a horrible way to be sick.

Oh god, you don't know how much I've searched for help, but I can't find it. I can't ask my family for help because they have prejudices about mental health (they're part of my problems too). I can't convince them. University resources have a six-month waiting list. How do they expect me to endure being like this for six months? I found another line, but it'll remain in a medical record, and I don't want that either, since they ruled out many physical illnesses due to stress on previous occasions when they were on my file, and I almost died from being ruled out for ""stress sequelae"" and ""anxiety,"" and I don't want any of that to happen again.

It's not like I'm making a fortune either. I was hoping to pay something virtual with what I earned from my new coffee stand, but I've barely sold 6 coffees at most last week, and I use my other minimum-wage job to keep me alive. I've tried to find another center, something to heal me, but there's nothing. I'm not suicidal, so there's really no helpline for me. It's affecting my entire life; I'm tired all the time, I feel sick, and there's nothing I can do about it.

I liked how it's not over sweet like other waffles. This one is for 110 - felt it's a bit pricy but fine, worth the price because of the proper sweetness in it.

•Later we tried Dalcha. The gurudwara street is filled with Dalcha shops now. I got to know from one of my friend that there was this small shop right beside this ""7 mitranchi special Dalcha"" which was the OG who started this Dalcha rizz and then every other shop on the street took over and his business isn't doing great now. 
- this Dalcha was fine, tasty enough. 
- we tried another Dalcha shop as well across the street. The Dalcha taste was mid there.

• Now to sit and chit chat, we have this cafe called destination near akurdi railway station itself. Been going to that place since the coffee prices were Rs. 25 or something, now it's Rs.50. The coffee isn't thick and all but something about this place makes me come back here every now and then. It's usually very crowded. We had cold coffee and cheese bread crums. Why?

I am going on an international trip to 4 major cities in Europe soon. I have never had bedbugs before but am scared to death by the possibility. My apartment made me sign a lease including a clause saying I would pay for any bedbug extermination for my own unit, as well as any other units they deem to have been infested via mine.

All that to say, even though I have no bedbugs, I want to make sure I have a solid defense plan. It is:

1. At every hotel, perform a thorough check of the bed, mattress, and surroundings based on several videos I've watched.
2. When not using my luggage in the hotels (during the day or at night), leave it wrapped in a thick heavy-duty garbage bag, preferably in the bathroom (some hotel room bathrooms may be too small or wet, so ... by the door?)
3. Do a quick check of the mattress every night as well.
4. Once I get home, carefully move all clothing to the laundry and start a hot wash and hot dry cycle.
5. Use [this steamer](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Wagner-915e-Multi-Purpose-On-Demand-Steam-Cleaner-and-Wallpaper-remover-0282014/202719943) that I bought (just for this purpose) to thoroughly steam suitcases, backpacks, fanny packs, and anything that can't go in the laundry.
6. ... Leave steamed items by my door to dry? I have more heavy duty trash bags but if I seal them up it might get mildewy/moldy inside, so not sure what to do here. I also have a giant plastic bin with a locking lid, if that helps. 

I don't have a garage, basement, or dry outdoor area like a balcony to put things in quarantine. I have a hallway that leads from my apartment door to my bedroom and living room, so that's why I'm extra worried.

**Questions for this group:**

1. Does the steamer look good enough for killing any bedbugs that may hitch a ride? It's advertised as putting out 100C steam but when I blasted it into a cup with my [milk thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Coffee-Thermometer-Brannan/dp/B00801KYCA) it averaged closer to 54C, and maxed out at 60ish (Is this even a valid way to measure that?)
2. What should I do for step 6?
3. Any other recommendations? Is this enough? Am I crazy?",2,1757399755.0,Bedbugs,2,1.0,False

I am 40 years old, Chinese race, exercise once or twice a week, ex smoker from 2002 to 2021, ex vaper from 2021 to April 2025. I believe it was the lifestyle choices and bad eating habits (skipped meals, over ate at times, extremely spicy food, salty and oily food, black coffee on empty stomach, etc) which let to Mild Chronic Gastritis and Intestinal Metaplasia.

Feb 2025, I started having indigestion. I would get full very fast, lack of appetite, lots of Gas in stomach, mainly discomfort, no pains yet. This continued to get worse till around the start of April which was when I quit vaping. I did not seek any medical advice, I just used Gaviscon at times to manage the discomfort.

May 2025, I started to clean up my diet as I didn't feel I was healing even though I quit vaping, in fact the gastritis worsened. I felt full easily, but would get hunger pangs every 3-4 hours or so. If I didn't put something in my stomach, more pain and discomfort would ensue. I would wake up in the middle of the night to have a snack, sleep was very disruptive. I averaged around 4-5 hours of sleep a night. It was a terrible time. 3rd week of May i started on Zinc L Carnosine and Multivitamin.

June 2025, I sought Medical advice, saw a GI specialist and went for Upper and Lower endoscopes, Ultrasound for Gallbladder, Liver, Pancreas and Full blood work. I was diagnosed with Mild Chronic Gastritis and Intestinal Metaplasia(random Biopsy was taken). I was given 3 months of PPIs (esomeprazole 40mg) to be taken after dinner. Things started to feel better. I was careful with my diet while on PPIs and Supplements. I took it for about 6-7 weeks but stopped as I was starting to develop acid reflux which I didn't have previously. I stopped PPIs overnight(cold turkey), it wasn't a very good plan as I started to get acid rebound. I believe tapering would be better.

August 2025, I started to take DGL and probiotics on top of Zinc L Carnosine and Multivitamins. After about a month of acid rebound, it is gone. I assumed I was healing as most of the pain/discomfort was gone. Sleep improved, appetite came back. I ate non-ideal foods and overate at times, as I was overly excited that my appetite came back.

September 2025, I went for another Upper Endoscopy to do gastric mapping because the GI specialist needed to find out how extensive the Intestinal Metaplasia was. Results came back, there was no Intestinal Metaplasia found in the 12 Biopsy samples (sized 0.3cm - 0.5cm) and the Mild Chronic Gastritis had turned Inactive.

As of today, I feel much better, though not 100% healed. The positive lifestyle and diet changes have helped in the healing process. I also de-stress myself every night by taking a long hot shower. I tell myself everyday, ""I am healing, slowly but surely.""

I have benefitted from good advice from, youtube, forums, articles, publications, etc. I would like to pay it forward. Do feel free to ask me any questions, I will do my best to answer them. Take care and get well soon everyone!",1,1757399431.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

* ☕ **Unlimited chai counter** – forget cocktails, the tea/coffee stall is where the real networking happens. Bonus: add pakoras = instant smiles.

* 🚗 **Easy transport** – valet service or golf carts if it’s a big venue. Elderly relatives shouldn’t have to trek across a football field to reach the mandap.
* 📸 **Make them feel included** – a quick group photo with the seniors before the dance madness starts goes a long way.
* 🕰️ **Plan key rituals earlier** – don’t keep the most important ceremonies at midnight. Elders will bless you more than Pandit ji if you wrap up on time.

I first got a call that my resume was shortlisted. Then… nothing. I assumed I’d been ghosted. But a month later, they called me again asking if I was still looking for a job. Of course, I said yes.

The interview happened, and from 16th July my training started for the Sports Analyst role. The initial training period was 1 month (16th July to 14th August), but they extended it till 27th August. During training they taught me Soccer, Soccer+ and Volleyball analysis.

My actual job started 1st Sept (going live).

Here’s how the experience has been so far:

Company vibe: Pretty chill. Infrastructure is good.

Cafeteria: Honestly terrible 😅. Free coffee and chai, but that’s it. Only thing you can “buy” is chips packets. Don’t expect proper food.

Work setup: Mostly WFH. Officially, it’s 1 day office + rest from home. If you want to go more often, you need to “book” a seat.

Night shift: You get extra pay + don’t need to book a seat since the office is basically empty at night.

Team allocation: After training, they do this interesting “bidding system” where all TLs (Team Leads) bid for new analysts. Whoever bids highest gets you on their team. I landed in a team with an average TL — not amazing, not terrible.


Overall, it’s been an interesting start. The work itself is niche, the system is unusual, and the cafeteria desperately needs an upgrade 😂.

My gardens died weeks ago from neglect (unless you count a fine crop of burrs), nobody has texted me in almost as long and the house is eerily silent. I am not sure why I am surprised… I have no way to reach you, and you have no reason to have interest in me.

Sometimes, I see shadows of you in the beautifully sad writings here. Too bad I can’t write for shit. Other days, I wonder why I was brought here of all places as the numbness of loss becomes overwhelming.

That’s a funny story. It’s classic me, and you’d grin, then guffaw if you knew. It’s so me that it’s infuriating.

I am always reminding people the chances of running into someone here is less likely than winning the Powerball. Twice. If only I could make jokes about probability without my own glass house shattering into sand.

I was originally sent to this damn place by a series of continuing coincidences over the last month, or so. A friend took it upon themselves to take the piss out of a depressed me with an oracle card and runes reading, and suggested that I pay close attention to the details around me.

Sure. Okay. I promptly ignored it. Then, the coincidences began. Every day, the same words kept popping up everywhere, like my own personal Bad Wolf. I only wished it was as cool. No, it was referencing a subreddit called Unsent Letters. I was being taunted by Reddit, and it was maddening.

Someone quotes some obscure author in a discussion on Aristotle with the words unsent letters. I look up in frustration and see a mud spattered bus with only two words of an advertisement visible. Someone calls in to the radio station to complain about their text messages. Billboards, even chalk written on sidewalks. It goes on and on and on. Relentlessly.

In all fairness, the astrology pamphlet I received on the street the other day while hurriedly trying to avoid attention was a bit over the top with the huge words emblazoned in swirly text about unsent letters from your twin flame. I mean, seriously? I burned it, and I would have already gone straight to my neurologist if others hadn’t also noticed my predicament, and find it absolutely hysterical.

I eventually threw in the towel and joined for good, concluding that showing compassion and offering support whenever possible didn’t cost me anything. However, letting some of those feelings loose for myself wasn’t as easy a decision.

Have the coincidences stopped? I was considering leaving Reddit yesterday when a friend on Discord randomly told me about some mail she had forgotten to post. So, you tell me. Can one get a restraining order against coincidences and a subreddit? Asking for a friend…

I’m still unsure what’s happening, but I’m here, driven by two razor-sharp words and the memory of you, lost in memories with my coffee cooling untouched.

Fuck, I miss you. I avoid the river like it’s radioactive and haven’t been there once this year where I used to attend the farmers’ markets and events nearly every week. I haven’t even watched a single minute of those shows past what we watched together. None of them. 

It’s been a tough time recently, grieving the loss of an another friend who lost to their depression. There’s been a lot of death, and I’m so, so tired of mourning. This isn’t an easy place to be. I’ve lost so many people, and I carry my own ghosts in that closet.

That’s why I was so worried about you in the end. I recognized the battle you were fighting as similar enough to mine. I understand the toll that sort of war takes on someone and the darkness it leaves, dredged deep in their psyche. I would have stayed by your side as comfort if you had only let me.

You hid so much from me. I know you believed I’d find your real face ugly and terrible, but it’s not true. I’ve seen you - broken, wounded, and sad. You’re beautiful.

I know you wear a mask and perform, even for me. Sometimes, I catch glimpses of you, but never quite enough to fully understand you. Just enough to know that I wanted to, and that I loved you. I was willing to wait as long as it took for you to be ready for an introduction. You’re worth it.

You’re beautiful. You’re damaged in all the gentler places you wish were something else, that match the scarred places in me. But to me, you’re not ugly at all. I wanted to run my hands softly over every part of you, discovering all the places our broken pieces fit together. All the places they could learn from each other so we could grow together and do better. I didn’t see shattered pieces; I saw stained glass. A little illumination - a little hope - would reveal its true potential.

All I ever needed is for you to show up as you are, even if it is not at your best. It would have been my honour. I wish you had realized before everything fell apart that I never needed you to hold back because you didn’t have the perfect manner to say something. I don’t need perfect or even good words; I just need to know the truth. I have autocorrect for the rest.

All I wanted was to hear that you couldn’t go any further in this without me. The world alone was as unbearably dark and painful for you as it had been for me. I just needed to know that it’s all in the past now, and you’re with me this time. That the suffering is finally over, and I will no longer be left alone.

I’m answered only by the quiet of the house around me and the faint wind chimes in the distance. I’m not young enough or foolish enough to hope. You told me you believed we were fundamentally incompatible and wished we had never met up that first day in July. You even said you wished our love had never existed. Those lethal words left no room for misunderstanding, so I respectfully took my unwanted heart to die quietly out of sight. Where else was I to go?

I miss you, I love you, and I wish everything was different because I wanted to follow you into forever. My universe is rewritten into regrets and raindrops.

What's next?,"I've officially completed all **938 questions** from the *CISA Q&A Manual 2019*. I've been tracking my progress in an Excel sheet (screenshot below) with my answer percentages per domain.

I've also supplemented this by watching the entire Prabh Nair's Coffee Shots playlist on YouTube, which was fantastic for conceptual understanding.

Now I'm feeling a bit lost about the next step. My main concern is the gap between my 2019 materials and the current exam.

**My main questions are:**

1. **Content Gap:** For those who have used both, are there **significant differences** between the 2019 Q&A database and the newest, paid-only ISACA QAE? I know the exam content was updated, but how *critical* is that difference? Are we talking a 10% change or a 40% change?
2. **Strategy:** What should my immediate next step be?
   * Should I immediately get the current official QAE database and grind that?
   * Should I first review all my incorrect answers from the 2019 manual?
   * Is there another good (and more recent) test bank you'd recommend that bridges this gap without the full cost of the official QAE?

I'm aiming to schedule my exam in the next 1-2 months. Any advice from those who have been in a similar spot would be incredibly helpful!

Thank you in advance for your guidance.

Sound familiar?

I'm a software engineer, so by the time I get home, my brain feels like mush. I've been trying to build a consistent writing habit for the past year, and it's been... a struggle. But [I've found a few techniques](https://cafeflo.substack.com/p/six-techniques-for-writing-when-youre?r=57dmps&triedRedirect=true) that actually work when willpower is at zero.

**Artificial deadlines:** I create fake deadlines for myself in a planner - when to write, when to edit, when to post. Sounds stupid, but it tricks the part of my brain that used to work best right before college assignment deadlines.

**Tiny calendar blocks:** I started with just 10-minute writing blocks. Not ""write the great American novel"" blocks - just ""turn thoughts into words"" blocks. The consistency matters more than the output.

**Embracing imperfection:** This was the biggest game-changer. I have a folder full of half-finished posts I was too scared to publish because they weren't perfect. Finally realized my ego was protecting itself from criticism by never finishing anything. Now I just try to get something done rather than something perfect.

The weird thing is that sometimes being tired actually helps. You're too exhausted to overthink, too drained for perfectionism. You just put words down because that's all you have energy for.

Still figuring this out though. What works for you when you're trying to write after a full day of brain-draining work? I'm always looking for new approaches since this is definitely an ongoing battle.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Now I’m overthinking if I came across a little needy by asking again so soon after our kiss. I don’t want to chase too hard or turn her off. My plan is just to reply to her last message with an “okay” and not text her this week.

But here’s my question:
1. Should I ask her again about her availability next week?
2. Or should I just keep the conversation light for now and let her make the move?
