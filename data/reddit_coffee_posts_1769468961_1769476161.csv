1qnz85g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1qnz85g/fucking_bullshit/,Fucking bullshit.,"The assistant manager called out again for tomorrow. After she was granted PTO for sat & sun by HR. That request went through GM, DM, and HR to get a decision, because noone thought she should get it. 

 Im supposed to go in for a 12 hour shift tomorrow night 6-6, and now ill be working 10-830 tonight.

Only good thing is, GM has started training me on daily paperwork and end of day reports. I'll be taking this Assistant's spot, and we are actively hiring to fix this shit. Need 3 new employees to replace a few people.

Ugh. Gotta go get ready. Too early for coffee, but it sounds good.

Ms. Escape: Marrying to Run, Fighting to Rise


Chapter 1 The Marriage Deal


A thirty-year-old man's desire was raw and blunt.

Adriana Xander had lost track of how long he'd been at it. Her body felt like it was falling apart, drowning in lust so intense she could barely breathe.

Matthew Langford knew her body too well. He hit every sensitive spot with precision. Not a single touch was wasted. He was smooth and skilled.

""Clear my schedule for the week starting tomorrow. I'm taking time off. Book two tickets to Neocoralis."" Finally done, Matthew stood by the bed, slowly getting dressed.

Adriana shifted her sore waist a bit, her eyes lighting up. ""Matthew, you're taking me on vacation?""

Matthew paused, frowned slightly, and looked at her. ""I'm going with Natasha.""

The smile froze on Adriana's face. She lowered her head awkwardly, saying, ""Okay, Mr. Langford ... ""

Seeing her pale face, Matthew spoke again. ""Adriana, you're just an orphan. You're young. I can't marry you.""

Adriana looked up at him, forcing a bitter smile. ""I never expected you to marry me ... But now that Ms. Jones is divorced and back, should we end this affair?""

Matthew's face darkened. He rubbed her head, trying to soothe her, and placed a card on the nightstand. ""Be good. Buy whatever you want.""

""Mr. Langford, I don't want to be a mistress ... "" Adriana stared at him stubbornly. She knew he'd marry Natasha Jones eventually.

""You're talking too soon. We'll deal with it when the time comes. Don't throw tantrums. Whether we end this or not isn't up to you."" Clearly impatient, Matthew glanced at her one last time and left.

As the door shut, Adriana's ears buzzed. She couldn't hear a thing.

Adriana was an orphan. Freshman year, her looks drew the wrath of rich girl Mia Langford. The bullying left her deaf in one ear, crushed her pinky toe, and nearly blinded her with a cigarette burn ...

Someone filmed it and posted it online. The scandal blew up.

The school called in the parents. Standing in for Mia was Matthew—her brother.

Maybe it was for the Langford Group's reputation, maybe out of pity, but Matthew reached out to the battered Adriana. The first thing he said to her was, ""Don't be scared. I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Spineless. Pathetic.

Adriana fell for him. At her most vulnerable, Matthew fed every fantasy she had about love and safety.

She used to think he was her salvation. But now ... he didn't love her. He just wouldn't let her go.

...

At the Langford Group.

Matthew had a meeting to handle his handover. Natasha waited in his office.

Soon, they'd be flying to Neocoralis together ... to spend seven romantic days ahead.

Adriana placed the coffee in front of Natasha, her chest aching like it was being sliced open. ""Ms. Jones, enjoy your coffee.""

Natasha glanced at her, smiling gently.

She came from a good family, perfectly matched with Matthew. They were childhood sweethearts. Natasha had that classy, elegant vibe. Born into wealth, effortlessly graceful—just sitting there, her confidence burned Adriana's eyes.

Adriana knew she lost. She never stood a chance.

A prince never really falls for a poor girl. He just used her to kill time.

Setting down the cup, Adriana practically fled the office.

She had no confidence. The orphan label, the poverty, the scars from the abuse—every inch of her screamed insecurity.

""Mr. Langford and Ms. Jones are going on their honeymoon? I heard they're official now. Once they're back, the engagement will be announced. Both families already gave their blessing.""

In the pantry, coworkers gossiped about Matthew and Natasha's wedding.

As Adriana filled her cup, the boiling water splashed on her hand, turning her skin red.

The cup slipped from her hand and shattered. Startled, she rushed to rinse her burn under cold water.

Matthew and Natasha were getting married.

This meant she and Matthew were done. And so was her internship at the Langford Group.

""Adriana, Mr. Langford wants you to drive him and Ms. Jones to the airport at 11,"" a coworker called out.

Adriana forced a bitter smile. Matthew ... is ruthless.

She knew he was doing it on purpose. There were drivers available, but he picked her—to remind her of her place and to kill off any foolish hopes.

In the end, both Matthew and Mia were bullies. They just had different ways of breaking people.

One shattered her body. The other crushed her already broken heart.

Pulling out her phone, Adriana hesitated for a long time before dialing a number she had once blocked.

""Hello, Mr. Lincoln. You once said ... if I agreed to marry you, you'd sponsor my studies in Pastalia. Does that offer still stand?"" Her voice trembled.

Marriage might be her only way out of Haldoria, also the only way to escape Matthew.

""Think it through,"" the man replied in a deep voice. ""Come to Clarke Residence on the 13th at 7 p.m. We'll discuss the details.""

The 13th. Eight days left. 


Chapter 2 Will She Die?


""Hey, Anna."" Adriana had just hung up when Natasha called her softly.

She turned around nervously, facing Natasha, who was standing in the pantry.

Too gentle. Too graceful. Even standing there with a smile made Adriana feel suffocated.

""M-Ms. Jones, what can I do for you?""

""I just remembered I still need to pick up a few things for the trip. Could you help me get them?"" Natasha handed her a handwritten list.

Her handwriting, like her, was neat and delicate.

Adriana froze for a moment. One word hit her like a knife—condoms.

""Thank you. Keep it between us,"" Natasha whispered with a wink.

Adriana nodded awkwardly and almost fled the pantry.

She had just turned 19 the first time with Matthew. It was her birthday. He gave her flowers and a cake.

As an orphan, she'd never even had birthday cake. That little cake and bouquet completely swept her off her feet. She gave him everything.

Bitterly, Adriana smiled at herself. What a joke.

Girls really do need to grow up rich. Otherwise, one cake is all it takes for a man to trick you.

Four years with Matthew, yet she had never once bought condoms. He didn't like them, so he always made her take pills.

But for Natasha? Of course, he couldn't bear to make her take pills. Too harmful, right?

...

On the way to the airport, Adriana stayed silent the whole time.

""We're tight on time. Drive faster,"" Matthew deliberately reminded her, sensing her mood.

""Yes, Mr. Langford."" Adriana nodded and turned left on the green light.

The car ahead had just crossed when suddenly a boy ran through the red light. Adriana swerved hard to avoid him and crashed straight into the median.

""Natasha!"" At the moment of impact, Matthew shielded Natasha in his arms.

Luckily, the speed wasn't high. Only the driver's side was badly damaged.

The airbag burst out. The crumpled frame pinned Adriana tightly against the seat. Her left leg was trapped, pain blurring her senses.

""Matthew ... "" Terrified, her voice trembled. ""Help me ... ""

She was terrified of being trapped in tight spaces, unable to move.

Back in her freshman year, Mia once shoved her into a wooden crate and locked her inside. No matter how hard she screamed, cried, or pounded, no one came.

The crushing pressure, the suffocating air—it was pure hell.

If the janitor hadn't noticed the urine stain on the floor the next morning, she would've died in there.

""Matthew!"" Seeing him about to get out of the car, Adriana panicked, forgetting that Natasha was right there. ""Don't leave me—""

""Let the rescue team and traffic police handle it.""

Matthew stepped out, shielding Natasha, his face dark. He called for rescue.

""She's still in there."" Natasha glanced at him, a bit suspicious. Assistants weren't supposed to call their boss by name like that.

Matthew pulled Natasha into his arms, shot a cold glance at the trapped Adriana, and then checked the time. ""No time. The crash wasn't bad. We'll grab a cab to the airport. They'll get her out.""

Matthew nodded, glanced at Adriana with meaning, but said nothing. She followed him away from the wreck.

Adriana lost it. She pounded on the window, struggling wildly. But Matthew never once looked back.

She knew he was afraid Natasha would get the wrong idea.

Watching him leave, her emotions finally broke. She sobbed uncontrollably. ""Matthew! Help me ... You promised you'd never leave me ...

""Liar! You're a liar, Matthew! You said you'd protect me!""

Her breakdown spiraled quickly. The depression and mania sent her into a frenzy, thrashing in the tiny space.

Her injuries weren't serious at first, but now she was hurting herself without even realizing it.

""Let me out ... Let me out!"" she screamed, pounding on the window.

The old trauma from freshman year clouded her mind, making it impossible to think straight, until the sharp smell of smoke from the engine filled the car.

""The car's on fire!""

""There's no one inside; I saw them leave!""

People on the road were shouting.

Adriana sat trapped, hopeless, counting under her breath.

""One, two, three, four ... ""

The night Mia locked her in that box, she counted all the way to 6,788.

She wondered, At what number will I die this time?


Chapter 3 Out of Matthew's Reach


Guess she was just too stubborn to die. Thankfully, Adriana survived.

When she woke up, it was already the next morning.

""Fractured right arm, mild concussion, multiple soft tissue injuries ... ""

The doctor stood by her bed, looking at her. ""Anything else uncomfortable?""

Adriana shook her head, picked up her phone, and checked it. Not a single call from Matthew.

But the man who never posted anything on his Instagram had, for once, posted a picture. The photo showed a crystal blue sea with a gorgeous view ...

Of course, the real focus was on Natasha in her Bohemian dress. She looked stunning—more beautiful than the scenery itself.

Adriana curled up, pulled the blanket over her head, and cried.

Four years with Matthew, and what was she to him?

Nothing.

...

Adriana returned to her tiny apartment after her discharge, took an ibuprofen, and fell asleep.

She had nerves of steel—slept a whole day and finally felt human again.

After sticking on a few pain relief patches, she dragged herself back to work.

She needed that intern paycheck.

""Did you see Mr. Langford's post? God, he's so whipped! He never posts anything but made an exception just for Ms. Jones!""

""Mr. Langford is the perfect man. He stayed loyal all these years, waiting just for her.""

The moment Adriana stepped into the office, she overheard her coworkers gossiping.

She let out a bitter laugh and sat at her desk. Yeah, Matthew loves Natasha. That part is true.

But loyal? Not even close.

Adriana found it ironic. Men are all the same. Love and sex are two separate things for them.

He loved Natasha with his heart. But his body? That had been with her plenty of times.

""Ms. Langford, this is a work area. Mr. Langford said—""

Suddenly, noise came from the elevator.

Adriana glanced over—and her blood instantly ran cold.

Mia had arrived.

""Get out of my way!"" Mia stormed in, high heels clacking, dressed head-to-toe in luxury. She walked straight up to Adriana.

Adriana shrank back, head down, shoulders hunched. The shadow of that bullying from freshman year had never really faded.

""Adriana, Matthew's coming back today,"" Mia whispered in her ear like a devil. ""He and Natasha are getting married.""

She let out a mocking laugh. ""Four years ago, I told you—the day Matthew dumps you is the day you die ... ""

Adriana froze.

Four years had passed, and Mia still wouldn't let her go.

Smack! In front of everyone, Mia slapped Adriana across the face.

Adriana didn't fight back. She didn't even make a sound.

She admitted it—she was a coward. She couldn't afford to mess with Mia.

Even though she'd fantasized about killing her a million times, as long as she wanted to stay alive, she couldn't make a move.

If one day she really had enough of living, she'd take Mia down with her.

But for now ... she was pathetic and desperate to live.

""Remember this slap?"" Mia sneered. ""Back then, Matthew hit me because of you. The first time in my life he ever laid a hand on me—and then he shipped me off overseas! All because of you!"" She grabbed the coffee on the table and poured it right over Adriana's head.

""You think landing Matthew means you've won? Who do you think you are? An orphan. That's all you'll ever be. Do you really think he'd marry you?""

Mia shoved Adriana's head down, her tone getting nastier. ""Get out of the Langford Group. Or I'll leak all your dirty secrets to the company chat.""

Adriana kept her head down. Silent.

By ""dirty secrets,"" does she mean when Mia and her friends stripped me naked during freshman year and took those photos? Or the fact that I slept with Matthew?

No one in the office dared to speak up for Adriana, because Mia was the heiress of the company.

After Mia finally left, a coworker cautiously whispered, ""Adriana ... how'd you get on the wrong side of the Langfords?""

Adriana smiled and wiped her face with a tissue. ""We went to college together. Had some drama.""

...

In the restroom.

Adriana hid in a corner, fixing her clothes.

She didn't cry.

Back in her freshman year, she would've cried like a child over how unfair life was.

Was it her fault that she was an orphan?

Did having no family mean she deserved to be bullied?

Now she understood. Being an orphan was original sin. No background, no protection—that's all people needed to crush you.

Bullies never need a reason.

Beep!

Her phone buzzed. A transfer notification—Matthew had wired her 50 grand through PayPal.

The drama at work today was loud enough. He must've heard Mia slapped her.

Wow! Fifty grand for a slap.

Not bad.

""I already called and yelled at Mia. Go buy yourself something.""

His voice message came right after.

Same line as always—go buy something.

""Thank you, Mr. Langford.""

Adriana accepted the money. She earned it. She'd take it.

She stared at their chat for a while. Some part of her was hoping for more. Hoping he'd at least ask if she got hurt in that car accident. But nothing.

She shut off her phone and went to HR to file her resignation. Since she was just an intern, the process was simple.

Tomorrow is the 13th. She had a meeting that night at the Clarke Residence with Curtis Lincoln.

If she nailed this deal, she could finally get out of the Haldoria city.

Out of Matthew's reach.


Chapter 4 You're Getting Married, Right?


After transferring the money to her bank account, Adriana headed straight to the big mall nearby.

Fifty grand was a huge deal to her. But for Matthew? Probably not even pocket change.

""I'd like to see that bag,"" Adriana said, gathering her courage as she stepped into a luxury boutique.

The salesgirl gave her a quick once-over. ""That one's 49,800 dollars.""

Adriana smiled. Perfect. That's exactly what she had.

""I'll take it. Please wrap it up,"" she said calmly, sitting down as her legs were killing her.

The salesgirl's attitude flipped instantly. She smiled brightly and went to get the bag.

In this store, a forty-something-thousand bag was entry-level. Nothing fancy. But for Adriana, it was dignity.

The moment she held the bag, it felt heavy in her hands.

She didn't feel more confident because of it. If anything ... she felt even smaller.

As she was about to leave the counter, another bag in a display case caught her eye. ""Can I ask how much that one is?""

She remembered that bag. Matthew had given the exact same one to Natasha. When Natasha carried it, she looked elegant, poised—radiating confidence.

""That one's a limited edition,"" the salesgirl smiled. ""Store display. You'd need at least 30 million in accumulated purchases or buy around ten million worth of products to qualify.""

Adriana froze.

Thirty million ...

What did 30 million mean? For Matthew, it was pocket change—something he'd burn just to make Natasha smile. For an orphanage, it could save hundreds of lives.

Life is both priceless and dirt cheap.

And Adriana? She belonged to the cheap kind.

The gap between her and Natasha wasn't just the price of a bag.

It was family, education, and every little thing that shaped who they became.

Matthew would never toss a few grand at Natasha and call it a day, because Natasha's worth far exceeded that ...

Adriana was never meant to play in their world. Funny how she once thought she meant even a little something to Matthew.

What a joke.

...

Back at her apartment, Adriana listed the bag on a resale site. The bag was brand new, priced slightly lower, and was easy to sell.

Once the money came in, she'd transfer it straight to the orphanage director's account.

The kids still didn't have proper winter clothes. Forty grand would be enough to get them through the season.

After a hot shower, Adriana stood by the clothing rack, naked, picking out what to wear for tomorrow's meeting with Curtis.

The door opened. Without warning or calling first, Matthew walked in.

Startled, Adriana instinctively grabbed a towel to cover herself. ""Mr. Langford ... ""

""You quit?"" Matthew frowned, carrying a bag of cheap fruit he'd grabbed from the market downstairs.

He never showed up empty-handed, but it was always small stuff—mini cakes, a few fruits, a simple bouquet.

""Yeah."" Adriana nodded. This apartment was his rental anyway. His coming and going was normal.

""Don't worry about Mia. I've got it handled."" He pinched her cheek lightly, pulled her onto the bed, and spoke in an unusually gentle voice. ""Still hurts?""

Adriana lowered her gaze and shook her head.

""I already spoke to HR. Your resignation's canceled. Just take a few days off and come back whenever you want,"" he said, like it was some kind of favor.

To Adriana, it was charity.

Honestly, it had always been. Ever since he found out his sister led those girls who stripped and humiliated her in college, Matthew had been handing down his pity from above.

""You're getting married ... right?"" Adriana took a deep breath, forcing the words out.

Matthew went quiet. He didn't answer.

Adriana smiled through the sting in her eyes. ""I won't go back to the company. I'll move out soon too. Matthew ... let's end this. Best wishes to you and Ms. Jones.""

She still had her pride. She wasn't going to be the mistress.

Matthew frowned, clearly annoyed. ""Are you picking a fight with me?""

Adriana gave a weak smile as she replied, ""No ... ""

He pulled her into his arms, like he was calming a tantrum. ""Stay here for now. We'll talk when the wedding actually happens.""

His tone was casual, like none of this should hurt.

Maybe, from the start, he never really saw her as a person.

""About that car accident ... Natasha was scared. She felt bad for not checking on you."" As he spoke, his hand slid along her slim waist—he always liked her figure. After all, he'd been the one feeding her since she was a teen.

At 19, Adriana was still underdeveloped from years of poor nutrition. It was Matthew who took her in and made sure she finally ate real meals instead of surviving on water, plain loaf, and leftovers.

""Tomorrow night, Natasha's hosting a family dinner. A few friends are coming, and I plan to propose to her at home. Come early and help out.""

He tugged the towel from her body, his hands already moving, his breath warm against her neck.

Adriana thought he was downright cruel.

At his core, he and his sister were exactly the same.

Had Natasha not satisfied him during all those days in Neocoralis?

""I'm not going ... "" Adriana said, pushing him off and grabbing the towel from the floor. Her stomach churned.

She had a meeting with Curtis tomorrow night anyway.

""If you don't show up, she'll get suspicious."" Matthew's tone turned cold. This was the first time Adriana ever pushed him away. ""She's divorced and a bit sensitive. I don't want her getting any ideas about us.""


Chapter 5 Matthew's Proposal


""You propose, and you want me to help your future wife ... Matthew, how are you any different from Mia? Why are you so cruel to me?"" Adriana's voice was hoarse, her emotions spiraling out of control.

She wasn't going to hold it in anymore.

Matthew's face darkened. He stared at her. ""Still saying you're not picking a fight?""

Adriana could barely breathe. What she wanted, Matthew would never give.

""Even if I don't marry Natasha, I'll marry someone else. Perhaps it's the daughter of the Cohens, or the daughter of the Hawthornes, but it will never be you. Got it?""

He couldn't have made it any clearer.

Adriana didn't have a family. She was never a match.

For someone like Matthew, pedigree meant everything. Taking her in back then was already the wildest thing he'd ever done.

He was never going to give her a title.

Adriana let out a bitter laugh. ""I never expected you to marry me. I'm not stupid ... I always knew this would end.""

""Adriana, you're an adult. Be realistic. As long as you behave, when this ends, I won't leave you empty-handed. Pick any house in Haldoria. I'll give you the car, the money—whatever you want."" Matthew stood up and stepped closer. ""Be here early tomorrow.""

""I want to get married too, Matthew."" Her voice was numb.

Matthew paused mid-step, turning back to look at her.

""I'm serious,"" she said, lifting her head. Tears spilled down her face.

""Get some rest. I'll pretend you're just throwing a tantrum. When you're really ready to end this and settle down, let me know. I'll find you a decent guy from the company. Middle-class, promising."" His tone was generous, then he turned and left.

He was sure someone like her couldn't find a better man.

He'd been patient enough.

He could give her anything—except marriage and a name.

Adriana smiled bitterly, collapsing to the floor.

He had slept with her for four years. Now that he was done, he wanted to marry her off to some controllable nobody.

Controlling her now. Controlling who she marries later.

Matthew really was cruel.

But it didn't matter. Tonight, she was meeting Curtis. Even Matthew wouldn't dare mess with him. If she married Curtis, everything would finally be over.

...

The next day, Clarke Residence No. 1.

All of Haldoria's billion-dollar mansions were developed by Harborton Clarke Estates. Matthew's house, Curtis's Clarke Residence—all top-tier.

Adriana had been to Matthew's house before. As his assistant intern, she'd picked him up here plenty of times. But every visit made her uneasy.

Maybe because she was an orphan, Adriana had always been obsessed with the idea of home.

Matthew kept her in an upscale apartment—one of the best in Haldoria—but that wasn't home.

It was a gilded cage, a place to keep her.

His real home was here. And she'd never belong.

""Anna is here."" Natasha greeted her with a smile as she walked in.

She stood there, completely at ease, looking every bit like the lady of the house.

Adriana had once wondered, too, what it would be like to marry Matthew, to stand here as the lady of this house.

But even thinking about it felt ridiculous. She never belonged in a place like this.

""Natasha, this is for you.""

Adriana handed over a gift—some homemade cookies.

She used to bake them for the kids at the orphanage. Worthless in money, but filled with sincerity.

Honestly, no gift she brought would mean anything in Natasha's world anyway.

Natasha smiled, opened the box, and glanced back at Matthew. ""Matthew, I think I see these same cookies in your car.""

Matthew's expression darkened. The mood in the room instantly dropped.

He probably thought Adriana brought the cookies on purpose, to provoke Natasha. He was pissed.

But Adriana really had no idea which car he'd put them in.

""Oh, actually, Mr. Langford has been busy and skipping breakfast. I made extras, so I left some at his office ... "" she rushed to explain, her fingers stiffening from nerves.

Her physical symptoms were acting up again—the psychosomatic side of her depression was getting worse.

""It seems like Matthew really likes your cookies, Anna. He even keeps them in the car."" Natasha smiled sweetly at Matthew. Her voice was always soft, yet as sharp as a blade.

Adriana kept her head down. The more she said, the more mistakes she made. Matthew would just think she was doing it on purpose.

""I don't like them,"" Matthew said flatly. ""Probably threw them out; Felix must've dug them out of the trash and left them in the car.""

Felix Caillet—his driver and assistant—was a convenient scapegoat.

Adriana stiffened. Trash. So, the cookies she woke up at dawn to bake, burning her hands full of blisters—to him, they were just trash.

He was really sending a message.

Natasha smiled gently and handed her a pair of disposable slippers. ""Relax. Let me introduce you to my friends.""

Adriana got the disposable slippers, while everyone else in the house had proper ones prepared.

That meant Natasha only planned to have her over once.

Matthew once told Adriana that Natasha was sensitive due to her previous divorce. But he didn't know—Adriana was even more fragile.

She was an orphan. She grew up in an orphanage, and reading people was how she survived.

Matthew clearly noticed the difference in the slippers but said nothing. His silence was permission.

A silent permission that she'd only ever be a guest here—once.

""Let me introduce you. This is Matthew's assistant. Such a pretty girl,"" Natasha said as she led her into the living room.

Adriana kept her head down, bowed politely, and looked up—only to feel like she'd fallen into a frozen lake.

Six people sat in the living room ...

Three of them were her college classmates, the ones who had bullied her for years.

Mia, Rufus Jones, Camelia Meyer ...

Her body froze. She couldn't stop shaking and glanced at Matthew, desperate for help.

Maybe Natasha didn't know her past. But didn't Matthew?

He knew Natasha had invited them. Yet he still forced Adriana to come.

Did he want her dead?


Chapter 6 Matthew Is Rude


Matthew deliberately avoided Adriana's eyes.

He shot Mia a warning glare, then disappeared into the study.

No matter how desperately Adriana pleaded or struggled, he ignored her. He was punishing her. He believed she brought those cookies to provoke Natasha.

Mia smirked. All three of them—Mia, Camelia, and Rufus—laughed.

Their laughter was sharp and vicious, like demons.

""Come sit, Anna."" Natasha smiled sweetly, waving her over.

But Adriana couldn't move.

Her legs felt like lead. Her mind was drowning in memories of what those three had done to her.

""Natasha, isn't this Adriana? Our campus queen ... "" Rufus sneered. The words dripped with sarcasm.

Natasha's face lit up. ""Oh? You're classmates? Great, get along then.""

Adriana stood frozen, one thought screaming in her head: Run.

""Natasha ... "" Adriana's voice trembled. ""I ... I just remembered something at home. I have to leave. I'm so sorry ... ""

She spun around, bolting for the door like her life depended on it—until her legs gave out after a few steps, sending her crashing to the floor.

""Let's walk our classmate out,"" Mia said, taking the lead, stepping closer with each word.

Adriana wanted to run. She really wanted to.

But she couldn't stand. Her body locked up, frozen from the inside out.

It wasn't just them she feared—it was everything she'd lived through.

""What's wrong? Can't get up, huh?"" Rufus grabbed the back of her collar and yanked her up like a rag doll. ""Our campus queen isn't gonna piss herself again, is she?""

Adriana lowered her head, her deaf left ear ringing in pain. Her face was tight, her skin burning. She tried to escape.

However, she couldn't.

""Matthew is getting married. To my sister. Now tell me—how should we handle you trying to hook up with my brother-in-law?"" Rufus grinned, throwing his arm around her shoulder, dragging her toward the door.

My roommate and I are moving to Phoenix and we’re trying to find the best high-rise apartments in the city. We’re both young professional women with jobs in Phoenix, and safety + building quality are big priorities for us.

What we’re looking for (we know not everything is possible, especially with price):  
• High-rise with balcony options  
• Safe/secure area and building  
• Nice amenities (gym, secure parking, lounge, etc.)  
• Walkable to restaurants/coffee/shops or easy to get around  
• Good community vibes

We’ve already looked into Scottsdale and don’t want to be in Old Town, so we’re focusing more on areas in Phoenix like Downtown, Roosevelt Row, Biltmore, Midtown, Uptown, or other neighborhoods you love.

Would really appreciate any recommendations, experiences, pros/cons, and hidden gems. Thank you! 🙏",2,1769475567.0,AskPhoenix,1,1.0,False

How do you deal with it?,"As the title states, one of my closest friends is a compulsive liar, she is known around town for being a liar ( I don’t know if she knows that 😂). But anyways, she lies about absolutely everything, I mean things that are so dumb you can’t even imagine lying about. for example we had arranged to meet for coffee last week I suggested a place and she said “oh no they don’t open on Sundays” low and behold, I drive by the place and it’s fully open. Like why!!! she told me she bought her first car that I’m yet to see her drive 😂, I was in my kitchen the other day and I could over hear her telling my sister that she works as a SNA, literally complete horse shit. She quit working 2 years ago after her 3rd child was born, I could name all the things she lies about but this would go on forever. And now, you could say just cut her off, dont be friends with her or confront her on her lies, iv done it before the thing is with the type of liar she is if she’s called out about lying she just lies to cover up the original lie so it’s pointless. All of It has crossed my mind, but at the same time she isn’t a bad person she makes me laugh we have similar childhoods and upbringing’s so we click and get eachother. But the lies man, I would love to know the psychological dynamics behind that because nobody is born a liar. But it’s even got to the stage now we’re even if she says something really serious I question it. because she lies about absolutely everything. I am smart about what I share with her, iv learned my lesson over the years and luckily everyone in town knows what she is like so she isn’t a very credible source. but honestly I am curious has anyone else experienced this? have you cut the person off? Are you still friends? how do you cope with a friend that is a compulsive liar.?  And do you think it’s a mental disorder? Do you think they can’t actually help it?

The setup was a white candle with words carved in (i put fulfillment, love (not a specific person), strength, luck and protection. I burned insence on the side, kept the window open, and placed the candle on a thick strong glass plate that has always survived my shenanigans until now. I put salt, eggshells, two cloves, cinnamon, a rose quartz next to it, pepper powder, coffee grounds and the matches i had used to light up the candle, insence etc... were disposed pointing forward on the plate, and i drew a little heart which was very visible admist all the ingredients, then i let the candle burn.

It was meant to be a fulfillment/love (in general, not just romantically) spell, and as soon as the spell started, i received a message from a guy i haven't talked to since middle school (and that i didn't really know) who started agressively flirting with me, even tho i showed disinterest and eventually turned him down very fowardly since he wouldn't take the gentler messages saying i'm not interested. Tbh i reallyy didn't feel it, and even tho i gave it a try to see what'd happen, everything i knew was screaming no. Plus my mother came home all stressed out and dumped everything happening in her life on me.

I got back to my spell after all the chaos and the candle was starting to burn out, but the flame refused to back down, it kept trying to agressively burn, making crackling noises as it engulfed most of what was disposed on the plate, i didn't get a good feeling so i kept watch over the spell until the plate ended up shattering, most likely because of the heat...

Felt it was an interesting story, i'm going through a tough patch in my life, and thought a spell could be a little boost.

Blend together a cup of the chocolate milk (13g protein), a scoop of isopure unflavored powder (25 g of protein) and a bunch of coffee ice cubes! 

Best part is that there is no alternative sweeteners in it. I've gotten used to them being in the fairlife shakes but I'm always happy to have a break from them as I am really sensitive to the taste.

It would probably be good with a scoop of greek yogurt too to add some extra protein and cut the sweetness if it is still too sweet for you!

In our previous sessions, we’ve had a lot of strong ideas about growth, support circles, principles, and the everyday stuff that shapes who we become. One pattern we noticed is that most conversations end at wisdom…but growth demands action.

For our next CoCo session, we’re trying a simple format built around a simple yet powerful prompt: **one small change that will fix society.**

Everyone will get a chance to share their take, and we’ll write all ideas down. Then we’ll do one follow-up question each to sharpen the idea and make it practical. After that, we move from opinions to ownership: everyone shares one action they can personally take to support that change.

Finally, the person who raised the idea decides: do these actions, combined, actually make a dent?

If yes, we’ll take commitments from those present, note any resources needed, and figure out how we can support each other’s action points.

**BONUS: We’ll also share the transition of Colorful Conversations under Hina Shahrukh Foundation. Ideas that are actionable and manageable under the Foundation can be taken forward by the idea initiator as Foundation projects.**

The bunker smelled of recycled air and old grief.

It had been three days since the school fell. Three days of hiding underground in the dark, listening to the world above try to forget us.

I sat at Melgor’s old metal desk, the surface cold under my bruised forearms. My ribs ached with every breath a sharp, jagged reminder of the failure upstairs. But physical pain was easier to manage than the silence in the room.

In front of me lay Livia’s file. It was stained with ash, salvaged from the wreckage by Zula. I traced the name listed under Next of Kin.

Carmen. Class A Healer. Status: Retired.

Livia’s aunt.

If anyone could fix this or at least, help us survive the injuries we were racking up it was her. But calling her meant exposing us. It meant admitting Livia was dead.

I looked up. Zula was across the room, aggressively organizing medical supplies. She moved with a rigid, frantic energy, slamming drawers shut, checking expiration dates on bottles she’d already checked twice.

“Zula,” I said. My voice sounded rusty.

She didn’t turn. “We’re low on antibiotics. Leo’s fever is down, but if it spikes again, I need ice. We don’t have ice.”

“Zula, stop.” She froze, holding a roll of gauze like a weapon.

“Melgor is gone,” I said. The words felt heavy, like stones in my mouth. “We haven’t... we haven’t talked about it. He built this place. He saved us.”

Zula’s shoulders stiffened. For a second, I thought she might scream, or cry, or throw the gauze at me. Instead, she just set it down on the tray with terrifying precision.

“Talking doesn’t fix dead, Zenos,” she said, her voice devoid of temperature. “Focusing on the living does. Do you want to mourn, or do you want to keep that kid in the corner from erasing reality?”

She gestured to Leo, sleeping fitfully on the cot. Then she turned her back on me and walked away, disappearing into the shadows of the ventilation alcove. She wasn’t cold because she didn’t care. She was cold because if she felt anything, she’d shatter.

I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding and leaned back, wincing.

I was alone. Again.

Three days.

That’s how long it takes for a tragedy to become a footnote.

I stood on the roof of the old lottery house, the wind whipping my hoodie against my face. The city lights blinked below, indifferent.

On the giant screen across the street, the news ticker scrolled in bright, cheerful red letters: YOUTH HERO PROGRAM INDEFINITELY SUSPENDED. ACADEMY RUINS TO BE DEMOLISHED NEXT WEEK.

Suspended. Like we were a bad TV show. Like we didn’t exist.

“They’re throwing us away,” Gaspar hissed from beside me. He was crouching on the ledge, frost creeping from his fingertips, freezing the gravel on the roof. “No school. No license. No future.”

Honny floated a few feet in the air, arms crossed, staring at the screen. “So we starve?”

“No,” I said. The anger in my gut wasn’t hot anymore. It was cold. Compressed. “We take what they owe us.”

I looked down at the bank. It was a small branch, pathetic really. Cracked tiles, rusty iron grates. The kind of place where poor people came to beg for loans they’d never get.

“All set?” Gaspar asked, eyes gleaming.

I clenched my fists. The air pressure around my hands dropped instantly, creating a vacuum that whined in my ears.

Boom.

I didn’t just jump; I launched. The pressurized air blasted me across the street like a cannonball. I crashed through the upper window, glass shattering into a thousand diamonds, and landed inside with a heavy thud.

Gaspar and Honny followed.

It was over in minutes. The vault wasn’t opened with a key; I blew the hinges off with a concentrated blast of air that crumpled the steel like wet cardboard.

We didn’t just take the money. We took the statement.

When we walked outside, bags in hand, the alarms were screaming. But so were the people. Not in fear in shock.

We stood on the street corner. The sirens were distant, but getting closer.

“Gaspar,” I said.

He grinned. “Merry Christmas.”

He ripped the bag open and threw the cash into the air. Honny used his telekinesis to catch the bills, spinning them into a whirlwind of green and gray that rained down on the stunned crowd gathering on the sidewalk.

“For your gas bill!” Gaspar yelled. “For the school fees! Take it!”

They rushed forward. People who had been ignored for years, scrambling for a piece of the pie. And for a second, looking at them, I felt like a hero.

Until the police drone hovered overhead, its spotlight blinding us.

“LEAVE,” I ordered.

We vanished into the alleyways, leaving the chaos behind. If the world wouldn’t let us be heroes, we’d be the villains that saved the neighborhood.

# Daniel

We were just stepping out of the hospital when the reality of our new life hit us.

The glass doors slid open, and the sunlight felt offensive. Too bright. Too normal.

Mom was at my side, finally off the IVs but limping heavily. Jerrod had one arm around her waist, supporting her weight. He looked wrecked—bandages wrapping his neck where his own heat had burned him, his face pale and drawn.

We walked slowly toward the parking lot.

“I can drive,” Mom said, her voice raspy. She was trying so hard to be strong. To be the pillar.

“You’re not driving anywhere, Giulia,” Jerrod muttered softly. “I got it.”

They were arguing about keys. Normal stuff.

Then the shadow fell over us.

Two men stepped out from behind a delivery van. They didn’t look like thieves. They looked like predators.

One was massive, his skin covered in shifting, grinding tectonic plates of stone.

The other was lean, fluid, water literally dripping from his fingertips and forming puddles that moved against gravity.

“Well, look at this,” the Water Man sneered. “The broken family.”

I stepped forward, putting myself between them and Mom. “Walk away.”

The Stone Man laughed. It sounded like rocks crushing together. “We heard the Association isn’t protecting strays anymore. Especially the weak ones.”

He didn’t wait. He lunged.

“RUN!” I shouted.

But Mom didn’t run.

She shoved Jerrod back and blurred forward. Even injured, even exhausted, she was fast. A streak of red hair and desperation. She aimed a kick at the Stone Man’s knee, moving at supersonic speed.

CRACK.

It wasn’t the stone that broke.

Mom screamed a sound that tore through my chest. She hit the ground, her leg twisted at a sickening angle. The stone skin was too hard. She had shattered her own shin bone.

“Pathetic,” the Stone Man grunted.

He reached down, grabbed her by the throat, and lifted her like a ragdoll.

“NO!” Jerrod yelled, hands glowing with solar fire, but he was too slow.

The Stone Man swung his arm and threw my mother.

She flew across the parking lot. Her body slammed into the side of a parked SUV with the force of a car crash. Metal caved in. Glass exploded. She hit the pavement and didn’t move. Silence.

Jerrod froze, eyes wide, horror paralyzing him.

But I didn’t freeze.

Something inside me snapped. A valve opened, but not the one I was used to. This wasn’t fear. This wasn’t adrenaline.

It was hatred. Pure, distilled, iron-tasting hatred.

Thump-thump.

My heart beat once, loud as a drum.

I felt the pouch of blood Zula gave me under my shirt. I didn't need it.

I needed mine.

“You shouldn’t have done that,” I whispered.

The Water Man turned to me, forming a whip of liquid. “You gonna cry, kid?”

I looked at him. And I let it go.

My skin split. Not a cut—a purge.

Blood erupted from the pores of my arms, my neck, my hands. But it didn't drip. It floated. It hovered around me in a crimson mist, vibrating with kinetic potential. It felt heavy. Dense.

I raised my hand. The mist snapped together, solidifying instantly into a long, jagged lance of crystallized red iron.

The Water Man’s eyes went wide. “What the—“

I didn’t throw it. I extended it.

With a flick of my wrist, the blood-lance shot forward like a piston. It pierced the Water Man’s hydraulic shield, punched through his shoulder, and pinned him to the wall of the hospital behind him.

He screamed.

I didn’t stop.

I turned to the Stone Man. He dropped his guard, looking at his partner.

“Jerrod,” I said. My voice sounded dead. “Break his shell.”

Jerrod snapped out of it. His rage ignited. He roared, his fists turning white-hot, and charged. He ducked a stone fist and slammed an uppercut into the giant’s rocky chest.

BOOM.

The stone cracked. A hairline fracture appeared on the giant’s torso.

That was all I needed.

I clenched my fingers. The blood from the Water Man ripped itself out of his wound, flew across the air, and slithered into the crack in the Stone Man’s chest like a living snake.

“Expand,” I commanded.

I solidified the blood inside him.

The Stone Man’s eyes bulged. He gagged. The blood expanded, forming spikes inside his rocky armor, piercing his organs from within.

He fell to his knees, coughing up dust and red foam, clutching his chest.

I walked over to him. I looked down. I felt like a monster. And I loved it.

“If you ever come near my family again,” I whispered, leaning close, “I won’t just stop your heart. I’ll pull it out.”

I released the pressure. He collapsed, gasping, defeated.

I didn’t look back. I ran to the SUV.

Mom was lying in the debris. Blood on her forehead. Her leg was a mess. But her chest was moving. Shallow breaths.

Jerrod fell to his knees beside her, his hands shaking, the fire gone.

“Daniel...” he choked out. “Is she...?”

“She’s alive,” I said, checking her pulse with bloody fingers. “Get help. Now.”

Jerrod ran back toward the hospital doors, screaming for medics.

I stayed there, kneeling in the glass and oil, my own blood slowly soaking back into my skin, waiting for the next fight.

The world wanted to hurt us? Fine.

I’d drown it.

# Jerrod

My hands were shaking.

Not a little tremble. A violent, uncontrollable vibration that rattled the keys in my lap.

I stared at them my hands. The hands that had blasted targets in the arena with pinpoint precision.

The hands that had held trophies while the whole school cheered.

Class A. Rank 1. incandescent heat.

The stats flashed in my mind like a broken HUD. Strength: A. Durability: A. Mental Fortitude: B.

Bullshit. It was all bullshit.

When that stone giant moved... I didn’t charge. I didn’t strategize.

I froze.

My brain just... stopped. Like a breaker tripping.

I looked in the rearview mirror. Mom was in the back seat, unconscious, her leg propped up on a jacket. Her breath was ragged.

She was hurt because I hesitated.

“Turn left,” a voice said from the driver's seat.

I looked at Daniel.

He was driving with one hand on the wheel. His face was splattered with dried blood dark, rusty specks against his pale skin.

He wasn’t shaking. He wasn’t crying.

He was checking the side mirror, scanning for tails, his eyes dead calm. Like he was bored. Like putting a spike of crystallized blood through a man’s organs was just a Tuesday.

I swallowed hard, tasting bile.

“Daniel,” I whispered. “That guy... back there. You...”

“I stopped him,” Daniel cut in. He didn’t look at me. “Focus, Jerrod. Watch the perimeter.”

I flinched.

He gave me an order. And my body reacted before my pride could catch up. I turned my head, scanning the street.

I used to protect him. I used to stand in front of him in the hallway so the bullies wouldn’t see him. I was the sun. I was the golden shield.

But sitting in that car, listening to the hum of the engine and the silence of my brother, I realized something terrifying.

The heat wasn’t coming from me anymore.

And for the first time in my life, I was terrified of the cold sitting next to me. I gripped the door handle until my knuckles turned white.

I am a coward, the voice in my head whispered. And Daniel... Daniel is a monster. God help us all.

# Tasha

My father didn’t say much when he dropped me off.

He stood by the car, waiting for my mother to finish crying. They hugged me, told me Aunt Mel would take care of everything, and drove off, disappearing into the white fog of the city like ghosts.

Aunt Mel lived in a narrow blue house that smelled like old wires and cheap incense. She opened the door wearing a bathrobe with coffee stains and a Bluetooth headset that wasn’t connected to anything.

“Oh! You’re taller than I remember. Are you sure you’re not adopted?” she asked, turning her back. “Come in before the pigeons steal your soul.”

Her house was filled with stacks of receipts, humming old machines, and a dozen calculators she called “my little darlings.” I sat on a couch with a spring that poked my thigh and listened to her argue with her invisible boyfriend, João who, for the record, was a cactus.

The next morning, I woke up early.

Something inside me buzzed. A restlessness under my skin. I walked around the house barefoot. I could feel the current. Every plug, every socket had a rhythm. A pulse.

I stepped outside, needing air.

And for a moment, I just… listened.

I could feel the wires in the telephone poles. The little charges running through the metal fences. Even the birds above me—they had something too. A bio-electric pulse. A tiny battery of life.

I stared at one resting on a tree branch, focused on the current beneath its feathers. It was so small. So fragile.

With a flick of my hand, I reached out with my mind. Just to touch the current. Just to feel it.

Pop.

The bird dropped dead. Stone cold before it hit the grass.

My breath caught in my throat.

I ran to it, knelt beside the lifeless little body.

I didn’t mean to do that.

Did I?

I felt its energy inside me now. A tiny static charge on my tongue.

It tasted… good.

I shuddered, pulling my hand away. I felt sick. And yet, I felt capable.

Aunt Mel came out with two mugs. One she gave me. The other she offered to the cactus.

“You ever wonder,” she said, taking a sip, looking at the dead bird but saying nothing about it, “why everyone wants to be a hero?”

I didn’t answer. My hands were shaking.

“Society only works if everyone has a role. But lately, seems like the only roles that matter are the flashy ones. You can throw a building, great. But can you file an audit on a corrupt politician?”

She looked at me sideways. Her eyes were serious for once.

“Power makes you hungry, Tasha. Be careful what you eat.”

She went back inside.

I sat there for a long time, staring at the sky.

I imagined a uniform. Black and gold. A mask. But then I looked at the dead bird.

I wasn’t sure if I was the hero of this story anymore. But I had power now.

And I wasn’t going to waste it.

# Zenos

“She’s right, you know. In her own way.”

I turned my head. Elis was sitting on a crate near the entrance, watching me. She looked tired, her pale skin almost translucent in the dim light, but her eyes that startling blue were clear.

She stood up and walked over to me. She didn’t ask permission. She just stepped into my space, her presence smelling of lavender and ozone.

“You look like you’re trying to carry the whole building on your back,” she whispered.

“Someone has to.”

“Not alone.”

Elis reached out and pulled my head against her stomach, wrapping her arms around my shoulders. It was a motherly gesture, intimate and strange. I stiffened for a moment, then slumped against her, letting the exhaustion take over.

“My father used to say the dead are heavy only if you don’t know how to carry them,” she murmured into my hair.

I closed my eyes. “Your family deals with corpses, Elis. That’s different.”

“Is it?” She pulled back slightly, looking down at me. “Why do you think the Association keeps them, Zenos? The bodies.”

I frowned. “For study. Autopsies.”

Elis shook her head, a dark, humorless smile touching her lips. “No. They keep them. Whole. There is a floor... deep down. My brother and father haul them in. Rows and rows of preserved heroes. Villains too. Anyone with a spark.”

A chill that had nothing to do with the bunker’s temperature ran down my spine.

“Why?” I asked.

“Because power doesn’t always leave when the soul does,” she said, her voice low. “My family... we act as the bridge. We use our own life force to wake them up. Not as machines. But as... echoes.

The Association stores them like batteries. But if I have to, Zenos, I can wake an army.”

She brushed a stray hair from my forehead.

“We are the leftovers, Zenos. You, me, these kids. The world wants to bury us. Maybe it’s time we showed them why the dead don’t stay down.”

I looked at Livia’s file again. Then at Elis.

“We need Carmen,” I said, finding my resolve. “And we need to get strong. Fast.”

Elis nodded.

“We’re going to war, aren’t we?” she asked.

I looked at the steel walls of the bunker.

“We’re already at war, Elis. We just finally decided to fight back.”",1,1769474851.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

It seems like coffee prices are going insane and I'd like to see if I can crowdsource some help.  I know it's a luxury, and it's one I enjoy, but, increasingly it's getting out of sight.  I love local roaster Trebelcock's Ethiopian light roast but it's now $26.50 for around 400 grams (a couple of years ago it was somewhere around $15-18).  I also enjoyed Equator's beans which I have recently finished a big order I made on Black Friday for less than $20 a bag and it is more reasonably regularly priced but still up there. Like us all we're experiencing the inflationary chunk out of our budget.  I recently bought a big 2 lb bag of Lavazza Oro on sale for $22,50 at Costco which was a great price ($12 a lb), but, I didn't enjoy it as much as it wasn't as fresh and the beans were more bitter. I'd buy more but it's not on sale anymore.  It may be impossible, but do any of you fellow denizens of our fine city know a place to get affordable fresh roasted beans in the GTA?  Preferably light roast but around $15-18 a lb including pickup/shipping?  Thanks in advance!",5,1769474411.0,askTO,7,0.86,False

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.

I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living anywhere in the world)
* 20–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me: You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip.

Okay, I’ve marked this spot for my hands on the floor, so you should be able to read this now. I need help, and I think this is my last chance to reach out before something truly unspeakable happens to me. I’ve tried everything else. So, if anyone who sees this has a way to break down a wall, I need you to find this house. Bring a gun, the police, or anything to demolish the building. If possible, bring fire. If you are unable to help me, it is then important that you avoid me at all costs.

My name is Jackie. I’m in a small mountain-side cottage that my friend rents out for ski-bums on weekends and things like that. I would give you the address if I had it, but considering we’re close and the place is hard to find, I got here via some backroad direction he scribbled down for me last time we hung out. I’d grab it and upload a picture, however the paper is out in the kitchen and… that’s just not an option for me anymore.

I’m getting mixed up, sorry. I’ve been stuck in this same room for a couple days now and I’m getting beyond desperate because it's starting to snow. I’ll start over and explain it better, I promise. Just bear with me, writing like this is extremely difficult.

I was wrapping up my final lectures at my school with my aforementioned friend, plus a few additional buddies that I see almost daily. His name is Sean, and he’s been one of my closer friends throughout college. 

We were all tuning out our professor’s wrap-up ramblings and spitballing what we’d be doing over winter-break after finals. Most of my friends included skiing or snowboarding in their list, and they all talked about it like heroin addicts between hits.

“Oh, I’ve got to go skiing at some point.”

“I heard lift-tickets went up but I’ll sell a kidney to make up for it.”

“I got new bindings and I’m thinking of getting my brother into it.”

That kind of stuff… I didn’t think it would be a big deal when I weighed in, saying, “I’ve actually never skied before.”

“Wait, actually?” Sean gasped, widening his eyes more than needed to get the point across. He was sitting next to his girlfriend, Charlotte, who I was also friendly with since we dormed together as sophomores. 

“You should try it!” she chirped with her cheerleader smile. 

She was always the perky enthusiastic type, which I guess meshed well with Sean’s steezy park-rat calm. Come to think of it, I was pretty laxed when I was a sophomore too, so maybe that’s also why she and I got along well. Or maybe they both just had rich enough families. Either way, I had never been good in the cold. I also didn’t like the idea of breaking a leg during my time off from school.

“I don’t really think I’m cut out for that. I’ll break something, plus renting equipment and everything is too expensive right now.” I responded, though it didn’t matter. Charlotte squealed quietly and excitedly as she flipped her hands onto Sean’s shoulder.

“Why don’t we all go back to your cabin some weekend? That could be fun!” she said to Sean. He cocked his head and his eyes lit up a bit at the thought.

“I mean we could.” He put a hand over Charlotte's and looked at me. “We’ve got tons of ski gear year round for when we rent it out to families, but I can check if it's vacant for a weekend.”

I had never heard of this cabin before, but it wasn’t really a surprise since Sean seemed to fill up each season with as much snowboarding as he could. 

“I just don’t know if I’d be any good at it though.” I warned them. Sean grinned as he immediately took out his phone and began texting his family I presumed. 

“Don’t worry, none of us are good.” He lied. “I mainly snowboard but skiing is a bit easier to pick up, and I’m sure we’ve got stuff that’ll fit you. Charlotte can teach you too.” Charlotte also smiled and began nodding quickly, her red curls bouncing up and down like maple leaves. I didn’t mind the idea of trying it out. Especially if I wouldn’t have to spend a couple hundred dollars to see if I liked it.

I didn’t really have to think about it too long in the end.

“Sure. I guess I’ll need to buy a bigger coat then.”

“Eh, you’ll get used to the cold pretty quick.” He added as he pulled Charlotte in affectionately.

Sean filled me in on the details of the rental house over the first week of winter-break. 

Originally, it was some tucked-away deal he found while browsing early in the season. After booking it with his family and loving the location, he told me they bought it outright to give the spot the luster it needed and get a few more people to rent it out.

He told me that he and Charlotte would get there a night early and ‘break the place in.’ which promptly reminded me of my spot as the Third Wheel on this trip. I would come the following night, but at least I’d get my own room.

As mentioned earlier, I was only able to find the cabin via some handwritten directions that veered me off the last named road on my GPS. I had already considered that road to be backwoods, but the twisting frozen mud trails that followed turned my van into a paddle boat in the middle of the ocean. My suspension groaned and creaked as the frosted bed of roots rocked me back and forth for what felt like an hour.

When I finally arrived, I was impressed by the sight of the cabin and actually began looking forward to my ski lessons.

Tucked away in a small pine tree outcove, the modest brick home sat quietly as a light flurry of snow drifted down in the moonlight. The ground was dusted, and I loved the ivy vines and earthy roots that caressed the cottage’s edges. The front windows were dimly lit with an orange glow, so I stuffed my clothing and water bottle into my bag and knocked on the door.

Nobody came, so I tried a few more times before the ripping cold began to sting. I scanned briefly for the hanging pot that Sean kept his spare key in. The harsh wind must have knocked it loose, and I found it had fallen into one of the pine shrubs beside the porch. I rumaged around in the roots and Ivy until my fingers gripped icy metal.

“Sean? Charlotte?” I asked into the cabin as I pushed the door open. I stepped out of the wind and slammed the door behind me. The draft dispersed, only the muffled sound of scattering snow howling outside remained.

One singular light was illuminated in the center of the room. It was one of those small bulbs that hung with a dangling chain to turn it on. It creaked side to side, all of the shadows it casted drifting as it swayed. 

“Guys?” I tried again. Still no answer. 

The place was small and quaint, with two bedrooms beside one another and a bathroom between. Potted plants lined every windowsill and table throughout the entire cabin, and it carried an earthy musk that reminded me of a greenhouse. Their roots were overgrown, spilling up over the edges of their containers as they searched for more unfrozen soil, bending and bulging at the knuckles to contort themselves until they looked like curled up spiders.

I was bewildered at how quickly they must have grown to not have been noticed. Why wouldn’t Sean’s family have thrown them out by now, or at least cut them?

It wasn’t modest either. A few of the larger pots had root extensions reaching up and inside of some of the tallest cabinets. Others reached off of the counter, and into a pantry beside it. 

Curious, I grabbed the door handle to the pantry, only to find the door hardly able to budge.

I pulled with all of my weight only to pry the door open a small crack and peek inside. My skin crawled as I saw an intertwining labyrinth of deep red roots latching onto the door from inside. They had anchored around themselves in some form of disgusting conglomerate, the sound of snapping twigs scrapping the floor as I tried to pull the door free.

With no luck, I let the door slam itself shut, and threw my stuff on the couch before looking around more.

My room was neatly made, lacking the cozy commodities of the rest of the cabin. The bed was nothing more than a plain mattress with a dense, scraggly blanket tightly pulled to the corners. Not even a pillow. The imposing brick walls were completely barren as well. No outlets, no paintings, and no windows.

I went into the other bedroom and found no sign of my friends other than their bags next to their bed with the sheets twisted in a frenzy, a stark contrast to my room. 

I sat on the foot of their bed, only for a cloud of dust to kick up beneath me as I did. I coughed, and took note of how dusty the whole place seemed. Looking back, I saw that I had actually been leaving a trail of footprints on the ground, and every movement I made left some form of impression in the dusty film.

I wiped my pants off and turned my attention to Sean and Charlotte’s belongings. They were also completely caked in dust. How long were they here for? Sean and Charlotte were only supposed to be here a day early but it looks like nothing had been moved in months.

My service was horrible, but I was surprisingly able to get a message out to Sean from this deep in the forest.

***Hey, I should be at the right place. I found the key where you said, but could you text me where you guys are? I’m alone at the cabin.***

I started unpacking my things while I waited for a response. I was glad to see the small TV on the mantle worked, though I could only get a few news channels and weather. I opted for the weather channel just before I heard my phone buzz.

***I’m with Charlotte. We went out for dinner but the snow’s starting to really come down and it’s gonna be slow driving.*** 

***Make yourself at home.***

I did. After an hour went by, I had successfully made myself some hot chocolate I found near the coffee machine and was watching some anime I downloaded on my laptop.

After another hour, my eyes started getting heavy and I decided to text Sean again before calling it a night.

***I’m getting pretty tired. Try and drive safe please.***

I slotted my laptop back into my bag and plugged my phone into a power strip near the TV to charge while I went into the bedroom, telling myself I’d deal with everything in the morning. Although the room was dark, save for the streak of light creeping in from the living room, I actually had a really easy time falling asleep. The sound of the snow, the stillness of the cabin… It only took a couple of hours for me to get woken up.

I heard a door slam loudly out in the living room and jolted upright, my heart already racing before my head could catch up. Feet slogged back and forth, the old wood creaking as a shadow moved past my cracked door. I listened to the careful shuffling in the room next door.

At first I just assumed Sean and Charlotte had hastily run inside to get out of the harsh weather, so I got out of bed to greet them. I started to open my door, but paused halfway through as I heard a rapid scurrying traverse across the house. With my hand on the doorframe, I felt it too. Fast, soft thuds reverberating through the wall before immediately pausing once out of sight.

My heart hammered against my ribs, and the sound of my blood pumping was comparable to a hurricane for how silent the room had become. I craned my neck, inching my forehead and eyes out from behind my door to look into the living room.

I saw the hanging lightbulb dancing around, whatever disturbed it no longer present. The once even coating of dust on the floor was now a mosaic tapestry of lines, imprints, and scrapes. As I examined it, I saw that the dust near the front door was notably less disturbed than any other door, and I realized that I was still somehow the only one who had opened it that day.

I continued to survey the room, but I wish I hadn’t. Now extending my head and shoulder out of my room, I could see that the pantry door was wide open.

The pantry was hollowed out. Thatchy vines and dead roots clung between the shelves like branches of wicker. Their fingerlike extremities had gripped all of the stored provisions, puncturing the containers and latching to their innards. The room smelled foul with a pungent odor like mold. My fingernails began to split from how hard they held onto the door, my whole body tensing up at the sight.

Despite how scared I was, I pulled my eyes away from the pantry and directed them towards the TV stand. I had my phone and keys right next to one another, no more than fifteen feet away from the front door. All I had to do was grab them and bolt. Even if I couldn’t do it quietly, I was sure I could be fast enough to get enough distance between me and whoever was here. At least enough to lock myself in my car. Then I could just start it up, it always performs fine in the cold, and drive away.

I swallowed. The plan was good, and I just needed to focus on running straight and not making any mistakes. I pivoted my legs, moving my hands to the edge of the doorframe to propel myself as I began running.

Then, just as I took a deep breath of the rank air before taking off, something pale and papery slipped through my field of vision. It brushed the space in front of my face and dropped to the floor with a soft, weightless rustle.

I snapped my head upward.

Something vast and tangled clung to the ceiling above me: a heaving lattice of blood-red vines, swollen and restless. As it shifted, dried husks sloughed free and fluttered down, shedding from it like dead skin.

It convulsed, and a wet, choking bellow tore out as a new length of root forced its way from the mass, splitting and unfurling into a crude suggestion of fingers.

I fell backward into my room and pulled the door back shut, encasing myself in darkness. I watched from the floor as the small sliver of light from under the door violently flickered as layers of thrashing vines reached down and felt about. A low, sickly moan vibrated against the wall while the wet roots caressed around and under it.

I saw the handle begin to twist, and I desperately crawled across the floor, throwing my body under my bed. I laid with my hands cupped over my face, dust stinging my eyes while the door slowly pushed open with a long squeal. I saw the silhouette of misshapen legs standing in the doorway and wormlike vines creeping across the ground.

I shut my eyes and waited.

I waited, then I waited even more. To my surprise… I just kept waiting, nothing ever happening past that. I eventually worked up the nerve to open my eyes, only to see the thing hadn’t moved an inch. I deadlocked my sight on it for minutes at a time, but it never moved. I waited more.

By the time I saw sunlight veering through the living room behind it, I found myself cautiously crawling out from under the bed. It stood in the door motionless besides the subtle swaying as it balanced on two thin stalks it used for legs. Like its legs, it had another entanglement of roots sticking out of its midsection in the rough shape of an arm, as well as a thin nub in place of a head. 

The whole thing was lopsided, its torso uneasily seated at a steep angle as its inner network of tendrils slithered with no real goal. The whole thing appeared… frail.

I heard my heart beating steady once again in my head, but I approached slowly. As I did, I noticed the distorted head lean slightly toward me as the thing shivered. I paused as it began to move for the first time in hours.

It shambled, using its web of vines tethering the doorframe to balance, and began adjusting its pose to place one leg forward and one backward. It shifted the crooked arm to the position of a walking gait, and I watched as more roots adjusted to define a pseudo-shoulder. It took on a new stance. My stance.

I took another step toward it and watched as it struggled to maneuver its legs in rhythm with mine. Seeing the pattern, I raised my right arm and watched it cheaply copy me. When I raised my left, a new tendril split free, forcing itself into bimanual symmetry. It stayed there for the rest of the day.

Unmoving, watching, improving.

I tried calling out for help, aiming my voice over its shoulder and around its newly proportioned head. I screamed and screamed until my voice turned to air, watching as the cluster of vines mocked me while I grabbed my throat in pain. Until that point, I didn’t dare touch it; but, with no voice left and craving water, I extended out my hand.

It had hands now too, and it mirrored my gesture confidently. I took two firm steps closer and exhaled steadily while I bridged the gap between us. It felt cold. The wet, fibrous makeup of its hand licked my palm and fingers as it pushed back against me. I pushed harder, and so did it. I raised my other hand, the thing doing the same to match my stance, and I began putting my weight into it. 

It was strong, but I heard the tension begin to tear away at the doorframe roots holding it in place. I pushed harder, then harder, and even harder until I felt my feet sliding behind me.

Our fingers interlocked, my nails digging into the back of its hands while it crudely attempted to do the same with its rough vines. I lowered my shoulders and shoved with everything I had. 

The roots snapped, and a bodily thud shook the ground as the thing settled its weight on its own two legs. Again, I stepped toward it and strained to twist myself through the doorway. Like trying to walk past your own reflection in a mirror, the thing was now matching me to the curl of my toes and blocking every attempt I made.

I stepped back while I panted in exasperation and glared at it with disdain. It stood, now able-bodied, breathing its shoulders up and down like mine. It didn’t need to though, I knew it wasn’t tired like I was. 

I tried it all. Getting a running start to shoulder-check my way through only sent us both equally crashing to the ground. I tried having it copy my position, maneuvering it behind the couch to trap it there, but it had no trouble shoving furniture aside whenever it got in the way. I threw my bedsheet over its head to blind it, only for it to calmly shake the fabric loose and let it fall to the floor every time

I watched the sunbeams creep across the living room until the sky outside grew fuzzy and pink once again. By then I was dog‑tired, just sitting on the floor. Of course it did the same, mindlessly showing me how pathetic I looked with no way to beat it. 

The feeling reminded me of high school whenever I’d fight with my parents. It’d never be fair. I was a kid and depended on them for everything, so it always felt like I had no ground to stand on in an argument. Anything I’d try to throw at them, they had ten times as much to throw back. I remembered slamming the door a lot during those times.

That’s when it clicked.

We both stood. I walked toward the doorframe, stopping just short of the threshold. The door was on the opposite side from me, but I mimed reaching for it anyway.

The thing copied me, its hand settling on the handle. I swung my arm through the air, and the thing kindly followed suit and slammed the door shut in my face.

I stood there in silence, savoring the sudden privacy. After a moment, I sidestepped a few times to be sure. I started to giggle when I saw its feet firmly planted on the other side of the door, not copying me for the first time in a whole day. Maybe with a bit of silence, I would be able to properly plan a way out of this hell.

The door shook abruptly as a thunderous bang struck it. I jumped at the sound and stood with my back to the opposed wall. The thing’s shadow thrashed around as it repeatedly threw itself at the door with shocking force. Getting faster, it began to moan once again as the door began to wobble loose on its hinges. With a final crash, splinters of wood broke free from the wall as the door toppled to the ground. 

A dark red stain overtook the door’s white paint, and I stared in horror as the thing slowly crept back into the room. Its head scanned around until fixating on me again, and slowly settled into the cowardly position that I must have been in.

It looked like its shoulder was broken, nearly flattened from beating against the door. A new surge of roots and vines reshaped the damaged area, and began making more tweaks to its figure. I watched as it developed breasts while thinning its arms and tapering its body to resemble a woman’s contour. Roots along its face shifted, opening a gaping maw and hollow eye sockets. It played with its new features, morphing its face randomly to get a feel for them.

“What do you want!” I screamed out, my voice still shrill.

It cocked its head like mine and smacked its lips as it tried to imitate my words. The hollowed out face made me gag, and I listened to the wet slapping of bloated face tendrils imitating my retching. I began to sob, and it formulated an uncanny frown as it tried to learn my idiosyncrasies.

I cried and cried as it continued to mock me. I couldn’t take it anymore. I ran to my bed and buried my face in the mattress to hide. As I did, I heard a heavy thud from the living room. When I looked back to the door, I saw the thing on its knees in the same way I was. The only difference was it was burying its face into a hardwood floor, not a mattress. 

I reared my head back and let it fall flat against the bed. It did the same, and allowed itself to fall to the floor. Again, only with force, I hit my head against the mattress. It copied, smashing its head into the ground and creating a notable dent in its flesh.

I slammed my head again and again, until my vision blurred, and it did the same. Dozens of times. I lost count. But it felt like the only shallow victory I could have against it. No matter how many times I repeated, even when its head was bludgeoned flat like an iron, it never slipped up its performance. 

This is about when I realized I wouldn’t be able to beat it myself. I feel canceled out, irrelevant. I had to change my approach to signalling for someone to find me.

When we stood up and approached one another, I noticed more. Tufts of hair sprouted above its hollow eye sockets, nothing like the red fibers below. Its flattened mouth reformed and small baby-like teeth wiggled themselves loose and fell on the floor. A few didn’t fall though, and I saw a set of developed molars had arranged ahead of its newly formed throat. I also noticed we were now the same height.

With the tears salting my cheeks, I wound up and punched it across the face with all of my remaining strength. It returned the favor, and I found myself waking up in the dead of night a couple hours ago with a sore jaw.

Dust coated my face and clothing as I strained to sit upright. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and I saw the blurry shape of a woman sitting across from me.

“Charlotte?” I whispered. My mouth was bone-dry, and my stomach churned in need of food. “I need water. Please.”

I crawled towards her, and we met in the middle to join hands. Her skin was cold leather. It felt like shaking hands with soggy tree bark. I squinted and forced my eyes to focus. Charlotte wasn’t here, and that thing had grown more horrid than ever before.

I didn’t panic since I had no more energy to do so. I steadied myself on the bedpost as I got to my feet and observed this foul assimilation of my own face. It had skin. It still had a slight red pigmentation to it, but I could no longer trace the pattern of woven vines like earlier. The empty sockets on its face now housed a set of bloodshot blue eyes that locked onto my every movement. Tears raced down its cheeks as it hadn’t developed eyelids yet, and I watched as its hairy tongue struggled to find a comfortable position in its cheeks.

She opened her mouth.

“Ch-arrrr… lotte.” She stuttered with a voice like locust wings. Her chest expanded slowly, and I heard raspy air squeeze its way down her throat. “Wat-errr.” She continued.

I just stared at her mouth as she chewed on the words, practicing the shape of me. A thought surfaced through the fog in my head, and I mimed unscrewing the cap of a water bottle. She followed immediately, perfectly.

My backpack sat on the floor about ten feet behind her which was roughly the depth of my bedroom. I walked backward, guiding her with me until she stood over it. She watched me closely as I bent over and grabbed the air where my bag ought to be. She scooped the entire bag into her arms and carried it back to the doorway as I walked. 

I inverted my hands, and she dumped the contents of my bag onto the ground.

My laptop struck first with a solid crack, followed by clothes, toiletries, then my water bottle. I knelt so she would kneel, and had her pick up the bottle. I extended my clasped hand outward toward her, hoping she would hand the bottle over to me.

She stayed still, holding the bottle to her chest and copying every bit of my position except for that arm. It felt wrong, like for the first time I wasn’t alone with my own shadow. I was alone with a separate person.

I pulled my arm back and thrusted it forward again, making the motion obvious so it would know what it had to do, but it just stood there with its pinpoint pupils fixed on me. 

Hoping I could be quicker than her, I lunged for the bottle to rip it out of her hand. Her arm snapped backward ninety degrees, bending at the bicep as though she had extra joints, and held the bottle just out of reach.

I tried having her throw or kick the bottle over to me, only for her to sabotage the movement each time and avoid handing me anything. I tried to have her reach my phone, but the brick bedroom wasn’t deep enough for me to cover enough ground and position her near the TV stand.

I was able to get her to throw me my clothing or turn the light on and off, but she would never hand me anything I needed. Sometimes for fun, I would beat my head against the mattress again just to spite her, but she won. She’s intentionally keeping me here, and was just polishing her performance while I was still alive.

I have one more idea though, and that’s what you’ve been reading so far. She also refused to hand me my laptop, but I figured I could still get some use from it. I’m currently knelt at the threshold of the doorframe with her beside me. I’ve had her open the laptop and sign in while I watch the screen. It’s really tricky, but I’ve traced the position of the keys in the dust on the floor to mime typing. 

She’s slow to type, but I imagine this is the most complicated thing she’s had to learn to do thus far. It started as a word every minute or so, but now she’s getting the hang of it. She’s almost as fast as I am, and I’m scared she won’t have much left to learn from me once we’re done. She’s watched me scream, cry, sleep, speak, and even urinate in the corner.

I don’t know where Sean and Charlotte are. I don’t know why they left me, but please find them. Find this cabin. Find me. Snow piles are creeping higher in the windows and it's getting colder in here.

If you do ever meet me outside of this place, don’t trust what I say. I hate the cold, and I’ve never gone skiing nor do I know a good cabin to stay at. 

If you’re still unsure about me, hurt me.

Not badly, just suddenly. Make me bleed. Make me flinch.

A little about me – I'm happy with my life and my peace. I don’t let just anyone in, but when I choose someone I give them my loyalty. My best nights are when I can follow my creative whims, like drawing or writing. Right now I am in college, an honors student aiming for a Master's in Creative Writing. My dream is to be a novelist one day. Most days I start with weightlifting, study something I'm passionate about, go on a walk if it's nice, and end with some journal reflection.

In a relationship – I'd want to do the things that are better with a partner. 

Cooking together, co-oping games, nights on the couch with a good book, and the playful teasing that leaves us both out of breath laughing. I prefer to take things slower and base our relationship on a strong friendship.

The girl I'm looking for – A little shy at first, but opens up when there's trust. I'll plan a low-pressure date, and we can see if we're a good fit.

As a side note, Final Fantasy is my favorite series and I'm aiming cosplay Cloud this coming con season. So I'd like to find a partner who'd enjoy doing cosplay and going to cons with me. You don't necessarily need to be in the scene itself, but if you are I'd love to see what you've done and what inspires you.

1qnybrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Letters_Unsent/comments/1qnybrn/to_the_woman_who_saved_my_life/,To the woman who saved my life,"Dear CYP,

I’ve been trying to understand why everything hurts the way it does the sporadic contact, the stretches of silence, the fact that I know you don’t love me back, and yet somehow it only hurts when it comes from you. I think I finally understand why.

You are my hero, and I love you. I don’t mean that metaphorically or dramatically. I mean it in the most literal sense of the word.

You saved my life.

Talking with you about comic books, about nothing and everything, about stupid jokes you somehow always understood kept me alive during a time when I didn’t think I wanted to be. You have no idea how much that mattered.

When we first started talking, I was in a really bad place. My brother had just left our family, and when he did, he said things that cut deeper than I ever admit out loud. He had been like a father to me, so losing him felt like losing my dad all over again. I was drowning in grief, anger, and loneliness.

That same day, I accidentally sent you a dumb Invincible video some ridiculous Omni-Man bees edit. It was a mistake. I didn’t expect anything to come of it. But we started talking, and suddenly I didn’t feel so alone anymore.

I thought that would be the end of it. One brief exchange. Instead, we kept talking. For over 200 days, we talked at least once a day every single day since my brother walked out of my life. You became something constant when everything else felt like it was falling apart.

That’s why I struggle whenever anyone calls me a hero. I’m not. You are.

Despite my best efforts not to let it happen, I fell in love with you quietly, unwillingly, without even realizing it at first. I know how strange that sounds. I’ve never met you in person. I don’t even know what you look like. And I carry a lot of shame about those feelings, because they feel unfair to you. You didn’t ask for them.

Now I’m here, on an internship in your city, and I want to be clear: that choice had nothing to do with you. After my brother left, I needed change, and when this opportunity came up, I took it. Still, I agonized over whether I should tell you I was here. I didn’t know if staying quiet would be kinder.

When I finally told you, a few days later you pulled away. I understand why. It’s a lot to take in. But something shifted after that. You seemed less interested in talking, even though you still seemed invested in the streak we had. And that hurt more than I expected, like you are talking to me out of obligation instead of friendship.

Sometimes I wonder if I should have kept you in the dark.

You once mentioned a coffee bar you wanted to try. I invited you. You said maybe, but you didn’t show. Later, you said you were busy. That’s when I understood. You’re not interested and that’s okay. Truly.

What hurts is the fear that I ruined something precious by saying the wrong thing or wanting too much. I’m terrified of doing anything that might hurt you or push you away, because you saved my life, and I don’t take that lightly.

I honestly believe I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you. And I know it isn’t fair to put that weight on you. You’re just a normal person, like me. You don’t deserve extra pressure or responsibility for my survival.

That’s why I know I can never say these things to you out loud.

But writing them down helps. It lets me honor what you meant to me even if you never know the full extent of it.

This exciting initiative is tailored specifically for shops seeking high-quality, artisan-baked goods to elevate their menu offerings and deepen community connection.

As big chains expand their footprint and supply chains prioritize scale over local tastes and community impact, many beloved local businesses suffer. Squeezed by rising costs, labor shortages, and limited capacity to diversify their menus, shops often struggle to keep their doors open.

When beloved businesses close or are forced to scale back their offerings, customers feel the impact, too. They have fewer choices, they find less differentiation from one shop to another, and the neighborly ambiance of these treasured local spots vanishes into a bland landscape of cookie-cutter corporate cafés.

*“We launched this program because local coffee shops are the backbone of truly vibrant and connected neighborhoods,” said* ***Jaga Bold****, baker and owner of* ***The Bold Bakery****. “These businesses are gathering places where friends catch up, students study, and anyone can pop in for a break from a busy day. Our goal is to give them high-quality bakery products that help them compete, without compromising their local identity or their bottom line.”*

# The Challenges for Independent Coffee Shops

Across the U.S., independent businesses of all stripes face mounting pressure. As giants with deep pockets and streamlined supply chains sweep into communities, they bring with them standardized products and limited creativity…and no meaningful connection to the neighborhoods in which they operate.

Coffee shops find it especially hard to compete, even without direct competition from big chains. High overhead costs from rent, utilities, insurance, and equipment maintenance cut into profitability. Without the purchasing power of a high-volume operation, the ever-increasing cost of ingredients (coffee beans, dairy, baked goods, etc.) cut margins even further. 

When going head-to-head with corporations, with their bulk purchasing power, huge marketing presence, and access to capital, it’s no wonder the nation’s, and Chantilly’s, small local cafés can’t keep up.

# Support From Within the Community

Gaining an edge over the big players in the coffee shop industry can make the difference for many independent establishments. Partnering with local producers is both a sound business decision and a way to keep community connections alive.

Customers are increasingly in search of authenticity, gravitating toward shops that feel unique, personal, and tied to the places they live. **The Bold Bakery’s** new wholesale program is designed to meet that need, offering locally baked, artisanal products that enhance the coffee shop experience and reflect quality, care, and a sense of genuine community connection.

# What The Bold Bakery Wholesale Program Offers

With this new program, **The Bold Bakery** provides local coffee shops with access to a selection of exceptional handcrafted baked goods. From seasonal pastries to signature cookies, muffins, and cakes, each confection is created with care and precision. 

The bakery’s commitment to natural ingredients, artisan techniques, and thoughtful presentation ensures products that taste exceptional and showcase beautifully on café counters.

Items that independent shops may feature from the program include:

* **Creative Cookies**: Rich, flavorful, and perfect for pairing with espresso or a cold brew.
* **Artisan Muffins & Scones**: Ideal for breakfast menus and afternoon snacks.
* **Seasonal Pastries**: A rotating selection of baked goods inspired by the fruits and flavors of each season.

# Big Benefits for Small Operators

Unlike the pastry products sold by large chain operations, which are typically mass-produced and shipped frozen to locations around the country, the emphasis here is on quality, freshness, and keeping things in the community.

With no less authority than Forbes noting that prioritizing added value is key for small businesses that compete with big chains (in fact, it was the [*number one recommendation*](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/05/02/19-ways-small-family-owned-businesses-can-stay-competitive-and-thrive/) on their list), independent cafés benefit from partnerships like these. **The Bold Bakery’s** fresh offerings provide community coffee shops with the added value of unique, locally produced, top-quality goods that can’t be found in corporate coffee shops.

There are bottom-line benefits, as well. Wholesale partners have flexible ordering options and can easily scale the size of their deliveries to match demand. This helps shop owners control inventory and reduce waste.

# Building Partnerships to Strengthen Communities

At its core, this wholesale initiative is about more than supplying baked goods. It’s about collaboration that has a ripple effect throughout the community.

*“We see* ***The Bold Bakery*** *as part of a local ecosystem,” said Bold. “When one coffee shop thrives, we all win: the shop owner, their team, their customers, and the neighborhood they’re in. That’s the vision driving this partnership program.”*

Okay, I’ve marked this spot for my hands on the floor, so you should be able to read this now. I need help, and I think this is my last chance to reach out before something truly unspeakable happens to me. I’ve tried everything else. So, if anyone who sees this has a way to break down a wall, I need you to find this house. Bring a gun, the police, or anything to demolish the building. If possible, bring fire. If you are unable to help me, it is then important that you avoid me at all costs.

My name is Jackie. I’m in a small mountain-side cottage that my friend rents out for ski-bums on weekends and things like that. I would give you the address if I had it, but considering we’re close and the place is hard to find, I got here via some backroad direction he scribbled down for me last time we hung out. I’d grab it and upload a picture, however the paper is out in the kitchen and… that’s just not an option for me anymore.

I’m getting mixed up, sorry. I’ve been stuck in this same room for a couple days now and I’m getting beyond desperate because it's starting to snow. I’ll start over and explain it better, I promise. Just bear with me, writing like this is extremely difficult.

I was wrapping up my final lectures at my school with my aforementioned friend, plus a few additional buddies that I see almost daily. His name is Sean, and he’s been one of my closer friends throughout college. 

We were all tuning out our professor’s wrap-up ramblings and spitballing what we’d be doing over winter-break after finals. Most of my friends included skiing or snowboarding in their list, and they all talked about it like heroin addicts between hits.

“Oh, I’ve got to go skiing at some point.”

“I heard lift-tickets went up but I’ll sell a kidney to make up for it.”

“I got new bindings and I’m thinking of getting my brother into it.”

That kind of stuff… I didn’t think it would be a big deal when I weighed in, saying, “I’ve actually never skied before.”

“Wait, actually?” Sean gasped, widening his eyes more than needed to get the point across. He was sitting next to his girlfriend, Charlotte, who I was also friendly with since we dormed together as sophomores. 

“You should try it!” she chirped with her cheerleader smile. 

She was always the perky enthusiastic type, which I guess meshed well with Sean’s steezy park-rat calm. Come to think of it, I was pretty laxed when I was a sophomore too, so maybe that’s also why she and I got along well. Or maybe they both just had rich enough families. Either way, I had never been good in the cold. I also didn’t like the idea of breaking a leg during my time off from school.

“I don’t really think I’m cut out for that. I’ll break something, plus renting equipment and everything is too expensive right now.” I responded, though it didn’t matter. Charlotte squealed quietly and excitedly as she flipped her hands onto Sean’s shoulder.

“Why don’t we all go back to your cabin some weekend? That could be fun!” she said to Sean. He cocked his head and his eyes lit up a bit at the thought.

“I mean we could.” He put a hand over Charlotte's and looked at me. “We’ve got tons of ski gear year round for when we rent it out to families, but I can check if it's vacant for a weekend.”

I had never heard of this cabin before, but it wasn’t really a surprise since Sean seemed to fill up each season with as much snowboarding as he could. 

“I just don’t know if I’d be any good at it though.” I warned them. Sean grinned as he immediately took out his phone and began texting his family I presumed. 

“Don’t worry, none of us are good.” He lied. “I mainly snowboard but skiing is a bit easier to pick up, and I’m sure we’ve got stuff that’ll fit you. Charlotte can teach you too.” Charlotte also smiled and began nodding quickly, her red curls bouncing up and down like maple leaves. I didn’t mind the idea of trying it out. Especially if I wouldn’t have to spend a couple hundred dollars to see if I liked it.

I didn’t really have to think about it too long in the end.

“Sure. I guess I’ll need to buy a bigger coat then.”

“Eh, you’ll get used to the cold pretty quick.” He added as he pulled Charlotte in affectionately.

Sean filled me in on the details of the rental house over the first week of winter-break. 

Originally, it was some tucked-away deal he found while browsing early in the season. After booking it with his family and loving the location, he told me they bought it outright to give the spot the luster it needed and get a few more people to rent it out.

He told me that he and Charlotte would get there a night early and ‘break the place in.’ which promptly reminded me of my spot as the Third Wheel on this trip. I would come the following night, but at least I’d get my own room.

As mentioned earlier, I was only able to find the cabin via some handwritten directions that veered me off the last named road on my GPS. I had already considered that road to be backwoods, but the twisting frozen mud trails that followed turned my van into a paddle boat in the middle of the ocean. My suspension groaned and creaked as the frosted bed of roots rocked me back and forth for what felt like an hour.

When I finally arrived, I was impressed by the sight of the cabin and actually began looking forward to my ski lessons.

Tucked away in a small pine tree outcove, the modest brick home sat quietly as a light flurry of snow drifted down in the moonlight. The ground was dusted, and I loved the ivy vines and earthy roots that caressed the cottage’s edges. The front windows were dimly lit with an orange glow, so I stuffed my clothing and water bottle into my bag and knocked on the door.

Nobody came, so I tried a few more times before the ripping cold began to sting. I scanned briefly for the hanging pot that Sean kept his spare key in. The harsh wind must have knocked it loose, and I found it had fallen into one of the pine shrubs beside the porch. I rumaged around in the roots and Ivy until my fingers gripped icy metal.

“Sean? Charlotte?” I asked into the cabin as I pushed the door open. I stepped out of the wind and slammed the door behind me. The draft dispersed, only the muffled sound of scattering snow howling outside remained.

One singular light was illuminated in the center of the room. It was one of those small bulbs that hung with a dangling chain to turn it on. It creaked side to side, all of the shadows it casted drifting as it swayed. 

“Guys?” I tried again. Still no answer. 

The place was small and quaint, with two bedrooms beside one another and a bathroom between. Potted plants lined every windowsill and table throughout the entire cabin, and it carried an earthy musk that reminded me of a greenhouse. Their roots were overgrown, spilling up over the edges of their containers as they searched for more unfrozen soil, bending and bulging at the knuckles to contort themselves until they looked like curled up spiders.

I was bewildered at how quickly they must have grown to not have been noticed. Why wouldn’t Sean’s family have thrown them out by now, or at least cut them?

It wasn’t modest either. A few of the larger pots had root extensions reaching up and inside of some of the tallest cabinets. Others reached off of the counter, and into a pantry beside it. 

Curious, I grabbed the door handle to the pantry, only to find the door hardly able to budge.

I pulled with all of my weight only to pry the door open a small crack and peek inside. My skin crawled as I saw an intertwining labyrinth of deep red roots latching onto the door from inside. They had anchored around themselves in some form of disgusting conglomerate, the sound of snapping twigs scrapping the floor as I tried to pull the door free.

With no luck, I let the door slam itself shut, and threw my stuff on the couch before looking around more.

My room was neatly made, lacking the cozy commodities of the rest of the cabin. The bed was nothing more than a plain mattress with a dense, scraggly blanket tightly pulled to the corners. Not even a pillow. The imposing brick walls were completely barren as well. No outlets, no paintings, and no windows.

I went into the other bedroom and found no sign of my friends other than their bags next to their bed with the sheets twisted in a frenzy, a stark contrast to my room. 

I sat on the foot of their bed, only for a cloud of dust to kick up beneath me as I did. I coughed, and took note of how dusty the whole place seemed. Looking back, I saw that I had actually been leaving a trail of footprints on the ground, and every movement I made left some form of impression in the dusty film.

I wiped my pants off and turned my attention to Sean and Charlotte’s belongings. They were also completely caked in dust. How long were they here for? Sean and Charlotte were only supposed to be here a day early but it looks like nothing had been moved in months.

My service was horrible, but I was surprisingly able to get a message out to Sean from this deep in the forest.



***Hey, I should be at the right place. I found the key where you said, but could you text me where you guys are? I’m alone at the cabin.***



I started unpacking my things while I waited for a response. I was glad to see the small TV on the mantle worked, though I could only get a few news channels and weather. I opted for the weather channel just before I heard my phone buzz.



***I’m with Charlotte. We went out for dinner but the snow’s starting to really come down and it’s gonna be slow driving.*** 

***Make yourself at home.***



I did. After an hour went by, I had successfully made myself some hot chocolate I found near the coffee machine and was watching some anime I downloaded on my laptop.

After another hour, my eyes started getting heavy and I decided to text Sean again before calling it a night.



***I’m getting pretty tired. Try and drive safe please.***



I slotted my laptop back into my bag and plugged my phone into a power strip near the TV to charge while I went into the bedroom, telling myself I’d deal with everything in the morning. Although the room was dark, save for the streak of light creeping in from the living room, I actually had a really easy time falling asleep. The sound of the snow, the stillness of the cabin… It only took a couple of hours for me to get woken up.

I heard a door slam loudly out in the living room and jolted upright, my heart already racing before my head could catch up. Feet slogged back and forth, the old wood creaking as a shadow moved past my cracked door. I listened to the careful shuffling in the room next door.

At first I just assumed Sean and Charlotte had hastily run inside to get out of the harsh weather, so I got out of bed to greet them. I started to open my door, but paused halfway through as I heard a rapid scurrying traverse across the house. With my hand on the doorframe, I felt it too. Fast, soft thuds reverberating through the wall before immediately pausing once out of sight.

My heart hammered against my ribs, and the sound of my blood pumping was comparable to a hurricane for how silent the room had become. I craned my neck, inching my forehead and eyes out from behind my door to look into the living room.

I saw the hanging lightbulb dancing around, whatever disturbed it no longer present. The once even coating of dust on the floor was now a mosaic tapestry of lines, imprints, and scrapes. As I examined it, I saw that the dust near the front door was notably less disturbed than any other door, and I realized that I was still somehow the only one who had opened it that day.

I continued to survey the room, but I wish I hadn’t. Now extending my head and shoulder out of my room, I could see that the pantry door was wide open.

The pantry was hollowed out. Thatchy vines and dead roots clung between the shelves like branches of wicker. Their fingerlike extremities had gripped all of the stored provisions, puncturing the containers and latching to their innards. The room smelled foul with a pungent odor like mold. My fingernails began to split from how hard they held onto the door, my whole body tensing up at the sight.

Despite how scared I was, I pulled my eyes away from the pantry and directed them towards the TV stand. I had my phone and keys right next to one another, no more than fifteen feet away from the front door. All I had to do was grab them and bolt. Even if I couldn’t do it quietly, I was sure I could be fast enough to get enough distance between me and whoever was here. At least enough to lock myself in my car. Then I could just start it up, it always performs fine in the cold, and drive away.

I swallowed. The plan was good, and I just needed to focus on running straight and not making any mistakes. I pivoted my legs, moving my hands to the edge of the doorframe to propel myself as I began running.

Then, just as I took a deep breath of the rank air before taking off, something pale and papery slipped through my field of vision. It brushed the space in front of my face and dropped to the floor with a soft, weightless rustle.

I snapped my head upward.

Something vast and tangled clung to the ceiling above me: a heaving lattice of blood-red vines, swollen and restless. As it shifted, dried husks sloughed free and fluttered down, shedding from it like dead skin.

It convulsed, and a wet, choking bellow tore out as a new length of root forced its way from the mass, splitting and unfurling into a crude suggestion of fingers.

I fell backward into my room and pulled the door back shut, encasing myself in darkness. I watched from the floor as the small sliver of light from under the door violently flickered as layers of thrashing vines reached down and felt about. A low, sickly moan vibrated against the wall while the wet roots caressed around and under it.

I saw the handle begin to twist, and I desperately crawled across the floor, throwing my body under my bed. I laid with my hands cupped over my face, dust stinging my eyes while the door slowly pushed open with a long squeal. I saw the silhouette of misshapen legs standing in the doorway and wormlike vines creeping across the ground.

I shut my eyes and waited.

I waited, then I waited even more. To my surprise… I just kept waiting, nothing ever happening past that. I eventually worked up the nerve to open my eyes, only to see the thing hadn’t moved an inch. I deadlocked my sight on it for minutes at a time, but it never moved. I waited more.

By the time I saw sunlight veering through the living room behind it, I found myself cautiously crawling out from under the bed. It stood in the door motionless besides the subtle swaying as it balanced on two thin stalks it used for legs. Like its legs, it had another entanglement of roots sticking out of its midsection in the rough shape of an arm, as well as a thin nub in place of a head. 

The whole thing was lopsided, its torso uneasily seated at a steep angle as its inner network of tendrils slithered with no real goal. The whole thing appeared… frail.

I heard my heart beating steady once again in my head, but I approached slowly. As I did, I noticed the distorted head lean slightly toward me as the thing shivered. I paused as it began to move for the first time in hours.

It shambled, using its web of vines tethering the doorframe to balance, and began adjusting its pose to place one leg forward and one backward. It shifted the crooked arm to the position of a walking gait, and I watched as more roots adjusted to define a pseudo-shoulder. It took on a new stance. My stance.

I took another step toward it and watched as it struggled to maneuver its legs in rhythm with mine. Seeing the pattern, I raised my right arm and watched it cheaply copy me. When I raised my left, a new tendril split free, forcing itself into bimanual symmetry. It stayed there for the rest of the day.

Unmoving, watching, improving.

I tried calling out for help, aiming my voice over its shoulder and around its newly proportioned head. I screamed and screamed until my voice turned to air, watching as the cluster of vines mocked me while I grabbed my throat in pain. Until that point, I didn’t dare touch it; but, with no voice left and craving water, I extended out my hand.

It had hands now too, and it mirrored my gesture confidently. I took two firm steps closer and exhaled steadily while I bridged the gap between us. It felt cold. The wet, fibrous makeup of its hand licked my palm and fingers as it pushed back against me. I pushed harder, and so did it. I raised my other hand, the thing doing the same to match my stance, and I began putting my weight into it. 

It was strong, but I heard the tension begin to tear away at the doorframe roots holding it in place. I pushed harder, then harder, and even harder until I felt my feet sliding behind me.

Our fingers interlocked, my nails digging into the back of its hands while it crudely attempted to do the same with its rough vines. I lowered my shoulders and shoved with everything I had. 

The roots snapped, and a bodily thud shook the ground as the thing settled its weight on its own two legs. Again, I stepped toward it and strained to twist myself through the doorway. Like trying to walk past your own reflection in a mirror, the thing was now matching me to the curl of my toes and blocking every attempt I made.

I stepped back while I panted in exasperation and glared at it with disdain. It stood, now able-bodied, breathing its shoulders up and down like mine. It didn’t need to though, I knew it wasn’t tired like I was. 

I tried it all. Getting a running start to shoulder-check my way through only sent us both equally crashing to the ground. I tried having it copy my position, maneuvering it behind the couch to trap it there, but it had no trouble shoving furniture aside whenever it got in the way. I threw my bedsheet over its head to blind it, only for it to calmly shake the fabric loose and let it fall to the floor every time

I watched the sunbeams creep across the living room until the sky outside grew fuzzy and pink once again. By then I was dog‑tired, just sitting on the floor. Of course it did the same, mindlessly showing me how pathetic I looked with no way to beat it. 

The feeling reminded me of high school whenever I’d fight with my parents. It’d never be fair. I was a kid and depended on them for everything, so it always felt like I had no ground to stand on in an argument. Anything I’d try to throw at them, they had ten times as much to throw back. I remembered slamming the door a lot during those times.

That’s when it clicked.

We both stood. I walked toward the doorframe, stopping just short of the threshold. The door was on the opposite side from me, but I mimed reaching for it anyway.

The thing copied me, its hand settling on the handle. I swung my arm through the air, and the thing kindly followed suit and slammed the door shut in my face.

I stood there in silence, savoring the sudden privacy. After a moment, I sidestepped a few times to be sure. I started to giggle when I saw its feet firmly planted on the other side of the door, not copying me for the first time in a whole day. Maybe with a bit of silence, I would be able to properly plan a way out of this hell.

The door shook abruptly as a thunderous bang struck it. I jumped at the sound and stood with my back to the opposed wall. The thing’s shadow thrashed around as it repeatedly threw itself at the door with shocking force. Getting faster, it began to moan once again as the door began to wobble loose on its hinges. With a final crash, splinters of wood broke free from the wall as the door toppled to the ground. 

A dark red stain overtook the door’s white paint, and I stared in horror as the thing slowly crept back into the room. Its head scanned around until fixating on me again, and slowly settled into the cowardly position that I must have been in.

It looked like its shoulder was broken, nearly flattened from beating against the door. A new surge of roots and vines reshaped the damaged area, and began making more tweaks to its figure. I watched as it developed breasts while thinning its arms and tapering its body to resemble a woman’s contour. Roots along its face shifted, opening a gaping maw and hollow eye sockets. It played with its new features, morphing its face randomly to get a feel for them.

“What do you want!” I screamed out, my voice still shrill.

It cocked its head like mine and smacked its lips as it tried to imitate my words. The hollowed out face made me gag, and I listened to the wet slapping of bloated face tendrils imitating my retching. I began to sob, and it formulated an uncanny frown as it tried to learn my idiosyncrasies.

I cried and cried as it continued to mock me. I couldn’t take it anymore. I ran to my bed and buried my face in the mattress to hide. As I did, I heard a heavy thud from the living room. When I looked back to the door, I saw the thing on its knees in the same way I was. The only difference was it was burying its face into a hardwood floor, not a mattress. 

I reared my head back and let it fall flat against the bed. It did the same, and allowed itself to fall to the floor. Again, only with force, I hit my head against the mattress. It copied, smashing its head into the ground and creating a notable dent in its flesh.

I slammed my head again and again, until my vision blurred, and it did the same. Dozens of times. I lost count. But it felt like the only shallow victory I could have against it. No matter how many times I repeated, even when its head was bludgeoned flat like an iron, it never slipped up its performance. 

This is about when I realized I wouldn’t be able to beat it myself. I feel canceled out, irrelevant. I had to change my approach to signalling for someone to find me.

When we stood up and approached one another, I noticed more. Tufts of hair sprouted above its hollow eye sockets, nothing like the red fibers below. Its flattened mouth reformed and small baby-like teeth wiggled themselves loose and fell on the floor. A few didn’t fall though, and I saw a set of developed molars had arranged ahead of its newly formed throat. I also noticed we were now the same height.

With the tears salting my cheeks, I wound up and punched it across the face with all of my remaining strength. It returned the favor, and I found myself waking up in the dead of night a couple hours ago with a sore jaw.

Dust coated my face and clothing as I strained to sit upright. My eyes adjusted to the darkness, and I saw the blurry shape of a woman sitting across from me.

“Charlotte?” I whispered. My mouth was bone-dry, and my stomach churned in need of food. “I need water. Please.”

I crawled towards her, and we met in the middle to join hands. Her skin was cold leather. It felt like shaking hands with soggy tree bark. I squinted and forced my eyes to focus. Charlotte wasn’t here, and that thing had grown more horrid than ever before.

I didn’t panic since I had no more energy to do so. I steadied myself on the bedpost as I got to my feet and observed this foul assimilation of my own face. It had skin. It still had a slight red pigmentation to it, but I could no longer trace the pattern of woven vines like earlier. The empty sockets on its face now housed a set of bloodshot blue eyes that locked onto my every movement. Tears raced down its cheeks as it hadn’t developed eyelids yet, and I watched as its hairy tongue struggled to find a comfortable position in its cheeks.

She opened her mouth.

“Ch-arrrr… lotte.” She stuttered with a voice like locust wings. Her chest expanded slowly, and I heard raspy air squeeze its way down her throat. “Wat-errr.” She continued.

I just stared at her mouth as she chewed on the words, practicing the shape of me. A thought surfaced through the fog in my head, and I mimed unscrewing the cap of a water bottle. She followed immediately, perfectly.

My backpack sat on the floor about ten feet behind her which was roughly the depth of my bedroom. I walked backward, guiding her with me until she stood over it. She watched me closely as I bent over and grabbed the air where my bag ought to be. She scooped the entire bag into her arms and carried it back to the doorway as I walked. 

I inverted my hands, and she dumped the contents of my bag onto the ground.

My laptop struck first with a solid crack, followed by clothes, toiletries, then my water bottle. I knelt so she would kneel, and had her pick up the bottle. I extended my clasped hand outward toward her, hoping she would hand the bottle over to me.

She stayed still, holding the bottle to her chest and copying every bit of my position except for that arm. It felt wrong, like for the first time I wasn’t alone with my own shadow. I was alone with a separate person.

I pulled my arm back and thrusted it forward again, making the motion obvious so it would know what it had to do, but it just stood there with its pinpoint pupils fixed on me. 

Hoping I could be quicker than her, I lunged for the bottle to rip it out of her hand. Her arm snapped backward ninety degrees, bending at the bicep as though she had extra joints, and held the bottle just out of reach.

I tried having her throw or kick the bottle over to me, only for her to sabotage the movement each time and avoid handing me anything. I tried to have her reach my phone, but the brick bedroom wasn’t deep enough for me to cover enough ground and position her near the TV stand.

I was able to get her to throw me my clothing or turn the light on and off, but she would never hand me anything I needed. Sometimes for fun, I would beat my head against the mattress again just to spite her, but she won. She’s intentionally keeping me here, and was just polishing her performance while I was still alive.

I have one more idea though, and that’s what you’ve been reading so far. She also refused to hand me my laptop, but I figured I could still get some use from it. I’m currently knelt at the threshold of the doorframe with her beside me. I’ve had her open the laptop and sign in while I watch the screen. It’s really tricky, but I’ve traced the position of the keys in the dust on the floor to mime typing. 

She’s slow to type, but I imagine this is the most complicated thing she’s had to learn to do thus far. It started as a word every minute or so, but now she’s getting the hang of it. She’s almost as fast as I am, and I’m scared she won’t have much left to learn from me once we’re done. She’s watched me scream, cry, sleep, speak, and even urinate in the corner.

I don’t know where Sean and Charlotte are. I don’t know why they left me, but please find them. Find this cabin. Find me. Snow piles are creeping higher in the windows and it's getting colder in here.

If you do ever meet me outside of this place, don’t trust what I say. I hate the cold, and I’ve never gone skiing nor do I know a good cabin to stay at. 

If you’re still unsure about me, hurt me.

Not badly, just suddenly. Make me bleed. Make me flinch.

3. Replace Soft drinks with Zero Sugar variants. - They are not as bad as you think. I have been drinking them for last 2 years and my blood report always gets 100 marks.

4. Add stevia sugar for coffee and tea if you are like me and can't drink then plain. 

5. Forget ice cream. Switch to Greek Yogurt + Blue Berries + Stevia sugar for dessert.

Incredibile how much this demo could be milked from CC alone. It's about time though this phase is ending and CV2 begins rolling out over the world. I can't imagine how much time I will put into the final game if I have already been entertained by this.

This is yet another character I made just cause I was still feeling bored. Her lore (also her name, and whether or not she is a Revenant of any kind or a very rare human survivor. Design may also change very little) is still being made up, but she was taken into Cobalt and Dahlia's custody, being seemingly too inadequate for fighting out there in her own. However, the two treat her very well, specially Dahlia, who sees her like a younger sister and tries to help her overcome her social anxiety. Also, she spills coffee or drinks for them.

1qny4dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1qny4dg/ive_come_to_realize_my_hatred_for_learning_new/,I've come to realize my hatred for learning new things and showing ADHD symptoms whenever trying to study *may* come from trauma.,"I, for the life of me can not focus the second I open up books or listen to lecture. Not only unable to focus, I **ACTUALLY** get tired and sleepy. You know the cartoony yawn people do when a teacher is boring? It happens to me literally anytime I am in an academic environment. Even if I wake up fresh from a good 8+ hour of sleep, I will start aggressively yawning the second I hit the books.

The crazy part is if I were to go workout or have an intense biking session, I will STILL have energy left for more physical activity throughout the day. So, this confirms it's not a matter of not having enough energy. Next, I tried listening to binaural beats and chugging coffee as I heard this wakes you up and improves fo- 😴💤.

With no one to look to for help, I asked chatGPT. After a long session of starting new chats because the stupid thing kept getting off track, we landed at exploring my childhood.

I used to be beaten a lot during study time (typical Asian backstory) and more precisely I was beaten for not being able to learn new concepts fast. See my mom was a gifted student, she was academically inclined. So in her eyes I was intentionally pretending like I wasn't understanding what she was teaching me.

So yeah GPT came to the conclusion that my hatred for learning new things and ADHD symptoms are a trauma response, if I am not able to instantly grasp and master something such as a subject, skateboarding, swimming, etc., I become disinterested and avoid. If I start studying or listening to lecture, the brain tries to divert my attention as a way of saying ""stay away from that, you will only be hurt"".

I’m a coffee enthusiast from Brazil, currently working as a professor, which means I love research and deep-diving into processes. I’m looking for a significant grinder upgrade to brew **30g V60 pours** (and the occasional French Press).

I’ve recently discovered my love for **fruity and funky/fermented coffees**. I’m chasing **clarity and sweetness** but I don't want to sacrifice too much **body/texture**.

**Current Setup:** I’m using a generic Chinese electric grinder (CF Wisdom/Wancle style). It produces a massive amount of fines. To get my brew time under 4 minutes, I have to grind so coarse that I end up with a hollow, under-extracted cup that manages to be both bitter (from the fines) and watery (from the boulders). I also have an old Hario Mini Slim, but it's not even worth the effort anymore.

**The Dilemma (Brazil Import Taxes Context):** Due to recent tax changes in Brazil (Remessa Conforme), importing grinders now incurs a near **92% tax** for items over $50 USD. Here are the final ""all-in"" prices I’m looking at (converted to USD for reference):

1. **MHW-3BOMBER R3:** \~$120 USD (The budget king right now?)
2. **Kingrinder K6:** \~$200 USD
3. **Kingrinder K7:** \~$250 USD
4. **1Zpresso K-Ultra:** \~$370 USD
5. **Bravito (Local Specialty Option):** \~$490 USD.
   * *Note: This is a high-end, locally made manual grinder in Brazil. It’s heavy-duty, uses 40mm Italmill conical burrs, has an ultra-stable axle, and allows for burr swaps (High Performance vs. Standard).*

**My Questions:**

* **R3 vs. K6/K7:** For those who have tried them, does the K6/K7 offer a noticeable sensory jump in clarity for fermented/fruity coffees that justifies double the price in this tax scenario?
* **The End-Game:** Since the K-Ultra is hitting the $370 mark due to taxes, does it make more sense to go for the **Bravito**? Being a local product, I get domestic support, modularity (burr swaps), and legendary stability.
* **Body vs. Clarity:** I’ve looked at the ZP6, but I’m afraid it might be too ""tea-like"" for my preference. Which of these options strikes the best balance between clarity and a syrupy body for 30g brews?
* **Is there a sleeper pick I'm missing?**

1qnxy89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClotSurvivors/comments/1qnxy89/should_i_get_checked_out/,Should I Get Checked Out?,"Hello! Starting with some background before I get into my concerns from today.

I was diagnosed with a DVT and a possible PE in January 2024 and then a bilateral PE in December 2024, both of which have been linked to my pregnancies since I don't have a family history of blood clots and the Factor V testing in May 2025 came back negative. I was on Lovenox twice a day during both pregnancies once I was diagnosed, and then on Eliquis after my second pregnancy since I'm not breastfeeding or pumping this time around. I came off the Eliquis the day before Thanksgiving and I've been in the clear since then (stayed on it longer than I did after the first pregnancy due to have a tubal done in November after baby 2 was born in August, just as a precaution).

Just about two weeks ago, I had surgery to repair an umbilical hernia. Since then, I've been up and moving around as much as I normally would be (or so I think anyway, with a few off days here and there to just rest and because we're currently snowed in so I can't get outside for the walks I normally take). My period also started over the weekend, which honestly hasn't been a concern in regards to the blood clots, but may be a factor in what's going on. It's hard to say since this is the first I've gotten my period multiple times after pregnancy and this is only the second one since coming off the Eliquis.

However, this morning, I choked on my first sip of coffee and ended up coughing a small clot up. Like, it was a bit bigger in size than a pea, maybe about the size of a small blueberry. When I felt it in my mouth, I thought it might have just been a piece of french toast that hadn't gone down all the way, but then I panicked when I pulled it out of my mouth because I haven't coughed up blood since January 2024 (one of the symptoms that sent me to the ER). I have also noticed a little bit of shortness of breath only when walking up the steps, but I recover from that a lot quicker than I did when I for sure had the blood clots in early pregnancy.

I'm going to make sure the humidifier in my room is filled before I go to bed tonight, but I don't know if this is a one time thing or if it's going to happen again. I haven't coughed up any blood since this morning, and if I do cough up anything more tomorrow, I'll obviously go get checked. I've also had a weird, metallic taste in my mouth all day since then. But, if I don't cough anything else up, should I still go get checked?

I do have my follow up with my surgeon on Wednesday, so I can bring it up to him, too. But if I don't have to leave the house tomorrow, that would be best since I'm not sure how great the roads are going to be after the storm that just hit PA. ",1,1769472834.0,ClotSurvivors,0,1.0,False

I \[26\] live in my parents house. My parents own the house but do not live here. In addition to me, my brother \[30\] and his wife also live in the house. So it is the three of u s. My sister in law moved in about 6 years ago when my brother and her were only dating. Not engaged, not married, only about 2 years into their relationship. My parents allowed her to move into the basement and didn’t charge her any rent. Soon later, my brother would move his things from his upstairs bedroom into the basement with her. I know it’s not my house but nobody asked me if I wanted her to move in and if they had, I would’ve said no. Now they’re married and have a dog who they always ask me to watch. On top of that, they now have a baby on the way. 

I spend the majority of my free time upstairs in my room while they’re downstairs in the living room and kitchen. Sometimes I’ll only go downstairs when they go to bed in order to avoid them. Is it normal for me to be uncomfortable being around them while theyre in the begining stages of starting a family??? im in my childhood home and yet it feels like im the visitor. 

fast forward to today to what really got me going. ill preface this by saying i know im not perfect. my sister in law always complains that i always leave a mess and i do. ill leave dishes in the sink, dirty pans on the stove, and cups out on the table. ill eventually wash them but i do it when its convenient for me. that says, my sister in law also leaves the occasional dirty pan out. i dont complain though, I just wash it and then use it to cook whatever im cooking.

Her and I are in NO WAY similar people. We are complete opposites and she is NOT MY WIFE, she is who my brother chose to be with. Today I spilled a cup of mostly finished iced coffee and immediately got up to clean it up. My sister in law who was in the kitchen immediately starts telling me what to do. “Use a paper towel” “get this towel” “don’t use that towel” etc. and lost it on me when I said I was just going to use the kitchen sink sponge to absorb the water and clean up. 

My thinking: sponge absorbs water. Don’t need to waste 10 paper towels or dirty up a kitchen towel. 

Her thinking: sponge is for (dirty) dishes. The floor is dirty and I’m disgusting. We’ll need to throw the sponge away if I do that……am I wrong here for thinking this is ridiculous??? Couldn’t we just….wash the sponge out??? I’m cleaning a wood floor, not the bathroom toilet. 

Also today, she got on me for not replacing milk that I use. Her and my brother always use stuff I buy and I always replace it myself. I just bought butter from Costco that we’re all gonna use. I didn’t replace the milk because I’m not drinking milk anymore so if they want it, that’s on them. If it were up to me, I’d label all of my food because I’m not trying to buy groceries for my brother and his wife. It’s just getting too annoying for me to deal with. I feel like a guest in my own childhood house. My sister in law is getting on my nerves, always changing things that I do and have done for 26 years. Moving the kitchen appliances, reorganizing the pantry, moving furniture. She’s overstepping in my opinion but trying to change me….SHES NOT MY WIFE. I feel like it’s nagging that I just don’t need. I didn’t sign up for it. Why does their relationship require me to change??? I shouldn’t be the one required to move out of my childhood home…it should be the ones who are married, with a dog, who have a baby on the way (and no room for it in the basement)",3,1769472532.0,offmychest,1,0.8,False

1qnxpsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qnxpsf/the_disappearance_of_veronica_clark_in_the_town/,The disappearance of Veronica Clark in the town of Swanford,"The following report is one submitted by Special Agent Theodore Lewis about his field notes while investigating the disappearance of Veronica Clark in the town of Swanford. It is the last report Special Agent Lewis would give.

\--Start of report--

17 year old Veronica Clark disappeared from her hometown of Swanford after informing her parents she was going to meet with her best friend, Donna Wright, on April 15th 1995. When Veronica had not returned by the next morning, her parents had informed the local station before Deputy Palmer called my office to inform Deputy Director Jennings of the disappearance. By 13:00 hour, I had been sent to the town of Swanford to report on the situation and whether a crime had taken place in the quaint area or if this was another case of a teenage runaway.

When Deputy Director Jennings first gave me the case, I did not understand why the FBI had been called on a possible kidnapping. However, I later learned that the missing teenager's father, Roger Clark, was an important official within his town and his daughter could have taken due to his reputation within the community.

The first place I went after entering Swanford was to speak to the girl's parents, who were quick to ask me questions about my investigation. When I explained I had just arrived, the mother seemed agitated while the father seemed to be calmer than his wife. He asked his wife to brew a pot of coffee while he pulled me aside, explaining that he believed his wife was overreacting to the situation and that his daughter would be back any time now. I thanked him for his opinion before I began my questioning.

""When was the last time you saw Veronica?"" They shared an glance between the two of them before Mr Clark answered.

""Last night, it was before dinner and she told us she was going to be with a friend instead. It must have been four or five in the afternoon by then."" I wrote down his answer before asking my follow up question.

""A friend? Would that be Donna Wright?"" Mrs Clark nodded, answering my question quickly. ""And have you had any contact with Miss Wright or her parents?""

Her parents thought for a moment before they shook their head, there was a look in Mrs Clark's eyes as her hand moved to cover her mouth.

""Oh God, you don't think Donna could be-"" She didn't finish her sentence, looking at her husband who seemed to have found a similar answer that she had as his eyes became equally wide. Mr Clark stood up suddenly.

""I need to call her father, he's an officer.""

""That is not necessary, Mr Clark, I just ask that you and your wife stay at home in case Veronica or anyone else tries to get in contact with you."" Mrs Clark looked at me with a confused expression.

""Anyone else? What like a kidnapper?""

""Don't say that Rosemary."" Mr Clark told his wife but he appeared to having the same thoughts as his wife. I handed my card with my contact information to Mr Clark before I left their home, moving further in the town to the local high school. I also told Deputy Palmer to find Officer Wright so he could be present while I spoke to his daughter.

I entered the high school and found Donna Wright in a science class with the rest of her peers. I pulled her out of her class and took her to the principle's office as we awaited her father's arrival.

Officer Wright appeared almost an hour later, he was almost drenched in sweat and appeared frightened. When he saw his daughter, he immediately embraced her, a cry escaping him before he composed himself, explaining to me that Mr Clark had called him before Deputy Palmer had told him I wanted to talk to him.

My interview with Donna Wright was short, she was unwilling in giving any answers that could help. I asked if she had been with Veronica last night and she told me she had not left her home or seen Veronica since that morning. I asked if she knew where Veronica had gone and she denied any knowledge. Finally, I asked if Veronica had a boyfriend or had mentioned anyone recently. Donna Wright looked unsure on whether to answer before her father told her to be honest and she sighed.

She told me that Veronica had been spending a lot of time with Tommy. I asked her who Tommy was and she told me she did not know. I asked Officer Wright and after thinking for a while about the name, he told me that the local butcher had a son named Tommy. I asked which class he was in but Officer Wright shook his head, informing me that Tommy was not registered at the high school and was instead taught by his father.

I thanked Officer Wright and his daughter for their help before I left the high school, asking for directions as I entered the butcher shop. The entire shop smelt of rotting meat. The smell of blood had somehow filled the air that should of been cold with how much ice they had. Behind the counter, there was a boy who could not have been older than twenty.

""Are you Tommy?"" I asked, showing him my badge. He did not seem alarmed, in fact, he looked like he was waiting for me to show up.

""I had nothing to do with what happened to Veronica."" I looked at him with a somewhat confused expression.

""What happened to Veronica?"" He rolled his eyes.

""You know what I mean. She told her friend Donna about us and now you think I did something to her cause she's gone missing. Well I didn't, she's probably fine, you know? I bet she's smoking pot with Harry, the slut. Did Donna tell you that? If anything happened to Veronica, Harry would know. They spend so much time together."" I could tell there was a bitterness to his words but I did not continue to talk to him. I thanked him for his help before I left the shop, making sure to take in a huge breath of fresh air from the outside.

From what I learned from Deputy Palmer, Harry Roman was a known troublemaker. Smoking, constant drug busts, the idea of him and Veronica Clark knowing each other was 'unheard of', according to Deputy Palmer. That did not bother me as I asked where I could find him. Deputy Palmer told me he was unsure but he knew that Harry would be in school the next morning as that is when he does most of his deals. I thanked Deputy Palmer and asked him if there was a local motel I could spend the night in.

He pointed me towards the direction of a motel as I went there for a night, taking a file with me to put together any information I could get.

There wasn't a lot so far, but I was hopeful that we would find either a crime scene or evidence of where Veronica Clark was by the next night.

When morning arrived, I left my motel room and returned to Swanford's high school. I called out Harry's name and was quick to find him when he turned to meet my face. He thought about running before he sighed, turning and putting his hands up.

""Okay, you caught me. I'll stop.""

""I'm not here about that. Veronica Clark, you know her?""

He let out a laugh as if I was being crazy.

""Veronica? Everyone knows Veronica, she's our future prom queen and I may have sold to her a few times, no big deal."" He was shoving his hands back into his pocket. The more time I was spending with Harry Roman, the more I was not enjoying his company.

""You dealed to her, what did you sell?""

He shrugged at me.

""A bit of pot here and then, oh and last week she asked for this root."" I pushed him for more answers.

""A root?""

""Yeah, I don't know, man. I had to buy it from this weird lady in town. But hey, she paid me triple the amount I brought it for!"" He seemed pleased with this. As I wish to continue my questioning, my pager began to beep with a message from Deputy Palmer. I turned off my pager and turned around, moving to return to the station. Before I left, Harry Roman called out to me one last time. ""Hey, there's a party tonight in the field behind the school, you should come! It's going to be wild.""

I made a note to inform the local officers of this drug filled party before I returned to the station, meeting Deputy Palmer who showed me what they had found in a bush on the edge of town.

A blood stained blouse.

""Is that Veronica's?"" I asked, Deputy Palmer seemed upset.

""The shirt is, we still need to get the blood tested."" He looked at me as the blouse was handed to one of the lab technicians to be tested. ""Mr Clark has given us permission to enter his daughter's room, I need you to join us."" I agreed and we all left the station, returning to the the home of the Clark family as we entered Veronica Clark's bedroom.

Her room was rather clean, light pink walls and a fluffy pink carpet on her wooden floors. There were a few posters up on the walls and a mirror standing up on it's own. Her bed sheets were settled on the mattress and folded nicely under each other. I went to her desk, looking at the wooden furniture as I went through each drawer she had. As soon as I got to the lowest drawer, it was locked. I was confused as I looked around her room until I found a small key hidden within her pillow. I was able to use it to open the drawer as inside I found a crumpled up piece of paper. I picked it up and read it carefully.

""Consume Valerian root a minute before midnight covered in the blood of a hoofed animal to find the true answer.""

The note was rather vague but I took it, leaving her bedroom as I moved to where Mr and Mrs Clark were sitting, huddled against one another before looking up at me with an expectation.

I was unable to actually tell them anything but I did have my own questions for them.

""Do you know anyone, a woman, who sells roots?""

A sigh escaped Mr Clark's mouth at my question.

""Yes, Miss Mystery.""

""Miss Mystery?"" His wife nodded as confirmation.

""No one knows her real name, but no one really talks to her. She acts like everything has a soul and she can read people, she's crazy.""

""Rosemary!""

""I'm sorry Walter but it's true! She's a crazy old bat and if she knows anything about what happened to Veronica then she should be treated like the witch she acts like and burned at the stake!""

Mr Clark grabbed his wife's head, burrowing it into his chest.

""I'm sorry about that, Agent Lewis, my wife is just worried about our daughter."" Mr Clark grabbed a pen and paper near to him as he wrote something down quickly. ""Here, she's right on the edge of town. You shouldn't miss her, she never leaves her shop.""

I took Mr Clark's advice and left the Clark residence, making my way to the edge of town until I found a shop labelled ""Miss Mystery's odd shop"". It was getting late by this point and I should of just returned to my motel room, but the time Veronica Clark had been missing was increasing with each minute that went by and I could not waste another second.

Bells jingled as I entered the odd shop, looking around. There were many items I did not understand, it was a whole new world for me and I was unsure on what was happening.

""Greetings Special agent."" I span on my heels, reaching for my weapon until I saw who had called my name. An elderly woman with long white hair, glassy eyes and pale skin. She was wearing a strange purple hat wrapped around her head as she wore a light purple dress that almost hanged off her. She smiled at me. ""I have been waiting for you. Come, sit.""

I took a seat next to her table covered in a dark velvet fabric, looking at her as she sat slowly stirring her tea.

""Are you Miss Mystery?"" I asked.

""Yes, I am. And you are from the FBI. It's been a long time since we've had one of you around here, which girl went missing now?"" Her voice was dry before she brought the tea to her lips, taking a long sip.

""Veronica Clark, I was told that you sold a root to a Harry Roman?""

Miss Mystery let out a hum.

""Oh yes, Miss Veronica, what a lovely young girl. And Harry, I couldn't believe my eyes when he entered my shop. But when Veronica came in a few days later, I understood.""

""So you have seen Veronica Clark?""

She let out a humourless laugh.

""My eyes may look like glass, Special Agent, but I can still see when I need to."" She smiled at me. ""She has gone missing, has she? I cannot be surprised by that.""

""May I ask why?""

Miss Mystery let out a hum as she placed a hand out in front of her, putting it down on the table.

""You have something that can help you understand why.""

I don't know how I understood, but I did. I pulled out the still crumpled paper and handed it to Miss Mystery. She took it, reading it back out loud to me.

""Consume Valerian root a minute before midnight covered in the blood of a hoofed animal to find the true answer."" She frowned as she finished reading the words, shaking her head. ""No, no, that's not right. It's meant to be a minute after, not before. Oh God, no."" She stood up suddenly, taking the note with her with shaky hands as she picked up a piece of Valerian root, coming back over to the table and handing it to me with a closed fist. ""You need to find her.""

""That's what I've been doing."" She shook her head.

""No, she's not somewhere you can see just yet. She's in Swanford but not this town, but she will be trapped if you do not find her soon."" I was confused but still I listened to her words. ""You must do what she did but after midnight, that is important. A minute after midnight, okay? You must take her out of the other Swanford before the entity takes her away.""

My pager went off again but I ignored it, looking at Miss Mystery as her eyes kept me trapped.

""The entity? What like a demon?"" I asked, not fully believing what she was saying as I thought about leaving her. Her hand grabbed onto my wrist as I felt her sharp nails dig into my skin.

""No, no demon here. It is a entity, it has been in this town since the beginning, it takes those who are vulnerable and it does not let it go. I know it is still here, I have seen it, I have felt it."" Her eyes were wide and wild.

""Do you have any proof?""

She let out a guttural laugh.

""Proof, look at me!"" Miss Mystery's grip tightened on my wrist as I bit back my tongue. ""I was able to escape but others are not so lucky, I try to warn those who come looking for help to stop what has always been here but I cannot. I cannot!"" She finally let go of my wrist, pushing the crumpled piece of paper back towards me. ""This is your only chance to find her, do it!""

With a snap of her fingers, I found myself walking out of her shop and returning to my car. Night had fallen quickly around as the darkness surrounded my vision. I ignored the night the most I could as I began to drive.

I thought about ignoring what Miss Mystery had said, return to my motel room and return the next morning, but I couldn't. I wanted to but I just couldn't. I looked down at my watch, only an hour until midnight. I sighed, looking back up before I felt my feet moving and my eyes widening. A deer staring back at me. I slammed on my brakes but it was too late, my car crashing against a deer and spinning towards a tree, wrapping around it as I felt my own head spin.

There was pain throughout my body but I ignored it, pushing my door open and escaping the crash as I looked at the front of my car. It was covered in the blood of the deer, the headlights broken and splashed in red. My hand grabbed onto the car to stop my head from spinning, my fingers touching the warm blood as I recoiled, wiping the blood on my shirt as I began to walk away. My legs were stumbling as I focused on the bright light in front of me. My knees buckled under me, causing my body to fall against the cold wet grass as I spat out some blood.

I looked down at my watch, midnight.

With all the strength I still had, I dug deep in my pocket for the root Miss Mystery had handed to me, bringing it up as my eyes stayed trained on my watch. As soon as the hands ticked to a minute past, I clamped down on the root, biting and tearing through it until I could swallow it down. I gulped and sighed, letting my eyes shut as my fingers grazed against my pager once more.

When I awoke, I was in a room that I recognised, Veronica's bedroom.

But there was something wrong with it's appearance, wrong.

The room was must larger, everything stretched away from one another. Her wooden desk was in a broken pile while her bed was a mess of dirt, blood staining her pillow and parts of her blankets. I was able to walk normally without any pain as my feet moved forward, a squelch reaching my ears. I looked down, jumping away as the once pale pink carpet was replaced with a collection of blood and guts. An eyeball in the middle of the mess stared back at me, blinking. I swore loudly before I ran, trying to move away but only feeling more wetness of meat under my feet with each move I made.

I screamed, running once more until I found myself in a different room.

It was colder, darker. I couldn't see any walls or floors but I knew they were there. I looked in front of me as the sound of fingers clicking.

A light shone in front of me, a dark figure staring back at me.

""Hello Teddy."" It called to me, I felt my breath being taken away.

""What the hell are you?"" I asked, shifting to grab my gun only to find it was gone. ""What do you want?""

""Want?"" The figure laughed wildly. ""I want nothing, I need everything."" The figure clicked it's fingers once more as I could see the missing girl, Veronica Clark. She was covered in blood, her nose bleeding and her strawberry blonde hair a mess. She was wearing a pink nightgown as she was shaking, looking up at me with fear in her eyes.

""Veronica? Veronica, my name is Special Agent Lewis, I'm here to bring you home, okay?"" She nodded at me, holding her hair over the lower half of her face.

""She will never leave."" I turned to face the dark figure.

""What did you do to her?"" I asked, my feet moving towards her. She let out a scream, causing me to stop as I watched her hair move upwards, causing her to move further away. I planted my feet back down, her screams ending as I did so.

""Me, nothing but him-"" The figure transformed in front of me, the dark air changing until I saw the figure of Mr Clark in front of me. ""He is a monster.""

Veronica looked frightened at the sight of her father, letting out small sounds of disagreements as she tried to move away from him.

""No, no, no!"" She continued to scream, grabbing at her hair and ripping out parts of it.

""Get away from her!"" I moved forward but the room stretched, causing Mr Clark and Veronica to move with it. ""Why are you doing this?""

""I need to feed, Teddy, I take those who are broken and I give them a life with people who will care for them. Veronica-"" At the sound of her name, the teenager flinched. ""She needs a new life, one away from the problems of her life. Her father, her friends, the ones who say they love her but did not try to save her. I can give her that.""

I thought back to what Miss Mystery had told me as I knew who I was talking to was the entity she had mentioned. I watched Veronica's terrified eyes as I spoke.

""You need to let her go.""

The entity laughed loud, slapping Mr Clark's knee.

""Let her go? She doesn't want to go, isn't that right, sweetheart?"" He grabbed Veronica's chin, forcing her to speak as tears continued to fall down her face.

""Please-"" The entity looked displeased as he pushed her away, throwing her down to the floor with a heavy thud. A sob escaped her as she held her face in her hands until her sobs transformed into laughs, deep giggles that filled the room. Her hands left her face, looking up at me with a chilling smile and wild eyes as the blood that once covered her was gone. Her laughs echoed the room until she let out one last final scream, the noises that escaped her throat becoming raw and her eyes rolling into the back of her head. She slumped to the ground, her body shaking until she fell silent.

The entity grinned.

""See? She's happy to be here.""

I tried to rush forward but the entity clicked it's fingers, pushing me to the ground as it's form changed again, the sight of Veronica Clark placing itself on the entity.

""Oh Teddy, you can't save everyone.""

""Veron-""

""Goodbye Teddy, I'll see you in thirty years.""

With the click of it's fingers, I awoke in a hospital bed. Deputy Palmer was by my bedside, standing up as soon as he noticed my eyes open.

""Special Agent Lewis, how are you feeling?"" I let out a groan.

""I'm fine, what happened?""

""How much do you remember?""

I thought about the sight of Veronica and grabbed onto Deputy Palmer, staring up at him.

""I hit a deer and I saw Veronica, she was trapped, we need to find her."" I tried to sit up but Deputy Palmer stopped me, making me lay back down.

""Special Agent, no, no. You've been unconscious since the crash, we found you on the grass. You messaged me.""

I thought back to the crash, laying on the grass as I bit down on the root, my fingers reaching for my pager. I tried to remember sending a message to Deputy Palmer but I just couldn't. I couldn't remember anything but the sight of the entity looming over Veronica.

""But I saw her, Veronica-""

Deputy Palmer sighed.

""Special Agent Lewis, Veronica is dead."" My eyes widened.

""What, no, how?""

""The blood on her shirt came back positive, our techs say it was too much for her to have survived. We're opening a murder investigation and starting a search for her body.""

""But I saw her! She was in front of me, she was right there!""

Deputy Palmer did not believe me, leaving the room as I laid in my hospital bed, hearing the noises of the hospital machines as I sighed.

I know what I saw, I know it was real.

Veronica is still alive, she's out there trapped in a different world, going through things I could not imagine. If I could find Miss Mystery, ask her for help, I could get her back, I swear I could.

You got to believe me, please, you've got to believe me.

It's the truth.

It's the truth.

It's the truth.

It's the truth.

It's the truth

It's-

\--End of Report--

Special Agent Lewis' report continues for the next ten pages repeating the same phrase. After receiving this message from Special Agent Lewis, he was placed in a psychiatric facility indefinitely and placed on leave from his position in the FBI. The disappearance of Veronica Clark in the town of Swanford has been given to cold cases as the later murder investigation ended with no body found or suspects arrested. The case will stay with cold cases until a new agent can be assigned.

Any attempts to inform Special Agent Lewis of the update in the case has left Special Agent Lewis screaming out to stop the ""Entity"" mentioned in his report. We have tried to find the ""Miss Mystery"" mentioned in this report but was left empty handed after discovering no one in the town knew of a ""Miss Mystery"" or her ""Odd shop"".

We believe that Special Agent Lewis' consumption of Valerian root caused hallucinations that may have led to his beliefs in seeing Veronica Clark and his later health problems. We believe that a local dealer named Harry Roman may have been the one to supply Special Agent Lewis during his short time in Swanford.

Deputy Director Jennings apologises for the actions of his agent and promises to make a change to his office.

We apologise for any distress Special Agent Lewis has caused and will do better in the future.

1qnxmyp,https://i.redd.it/op291rms8sfg1.jpeg,Be My Own Light | When I was two months pregnant,"When I was two months pregnant, Julian asked me to give his childhood friend a blood transfusion. I refused because I was anemic, but his friends were all saying that I ignored the overall situation.

""Anne is lying in the operating room and you're the only one with a matching blood type. What's wrong with donating a little blood?"" After saying that, several of them grabbed me and pushed me inside.

A fleeting moment of sympathy crossed Julian's eyes, but he steeled himself. ""It's just a blood transfusion. Our child will be okay."" I stopped struggling. A tear slid down my cheek.

After the transfusion, I dragged my weak body to the obstetrics and gynecology department for an operation to terminate the pregnancy.

I stayed in the hospital alone for three days after the surgery, while Julian remained by Anne's side all the time. My womb was empty, but the pain was piercing my heart.

I ran into Julian, Anne and many of his friends when I got discharged. I was carrying my backpack alone, but Anne had Julian to help her walk.

Julian momentarily paused when he saw me. ""Why are you still at the hospital?""

""Nothing."" I hid the miscarriage and walked out the door with a pale face.

""We'll leave together,"" he said, grabbing my arm in a tone that left no room for argument.

Anne quickly entered the front passenger seat when we reached the car. Then she said with an innocent expression and sparkling eyes, ""Scarlett, I just had stomach ulcer surgery and got carsick easily. Could you please let me have this seat?""

I didn't argue and opened the door to the back seat, but his friends all rushed in. Now, three grown men squeezed into the backseat at once. They stared at me with hostility.

""Scarlett, Anne is still weak. We'll all come to your house to take care of her.""

I looked toward Julian in the driver's seat. His face was stiff, but he didn't say a word to refute them. I smiled bitterly as the sound of cicadas filled the air. How could I still have expectations for this man?

Julian's friends hated me. They thought he was perfect for Anne and saw me as a villain trying to break them up.

They treated me like a servant in my own house and Julian never once defended me. Even if I was pregnant with his child, I still had to give Anne a blood transfusion. They didn't even say thank you at the end; they just said it was my honor.

It wasn't the first time I'd been mistreated, but it was the first time I'd chosen to accept it without a fight. ""Fine, I'll head home on my own.""

I shut the car door and walked off ahead of them. It was rush hour, so I couldn't even catch a cab. As someone who had just had a pregnancy termination surgery, I walked for an hour in the sweltering heat before returning home.

I was greeted by harsh complaints when I pushed the door open.

""Scarlett, why are you so slow? We've been home for ages.""

""We haven't eaten all night. Come on, let's taste your cooking again.""

I turned my gaze to Julian and Anne. It was a sweltering summer day and the air conditioning was off because they didn't want the fragile Anne to catch a cold. Julian sat beside her, fanning her with a paper fan.

Despite breaking into a sweat himself, he ignored it entirely and kept fawning over Anne. Sam shouted after seeing I was quiet, ""Julian, we're all starving! Tell your wife to cook us something to eat!""

Chapter 2

Julian finally looked up. He casually ordered without noticing how pale I was, ""Scarlett, go make us something simple to eat and make some soup for Anne. It'll help her recover.""

A sharp pain stabbed at my heart, making it hard to breathe. I turned and walked into the kitchen, trying to block out their happy voices. I felt like a stranger in my own home.

I used to argue with them hysterically as if it could restore my dignity. Still, I didn't realize that my outbursts only fueled their arrogance.

Anne was always patient and different from my childish nature, but I've had enough. These people, this relationship—it's not worth the energy.

I was exhausted by the time I brought out the food. Anne offered to help but flinched away as I handed her the soup. The chicken soup spilled all over the floor and the bowl shattered into countless pieces.

""Watch out!"" Julian quickly shielded Anne, but a large patch of my calf turned red from the scalding liquid.

""Scarlett, I know you don't like me, but you didn’t have to drop the bowl on purpose!"" Even though not a single drop of soup splashed on her, Anne threw herself into Julian's arms and acted like she had been wronged.

""That's right. What are you doing, Scarlett?""

""You've been targeting Anne for so long. We're all just friends—why are you acting like this?""

""She let go of the bowl first.""

I coldly swept my gaze over the people chastising me and spoke calmly. Still, Julian cut them off sharply before they could say more. ""Scarlett, apologize! You've gone too far this time. Anne just got out of the hospital and you scared her.""

Even though it was a hot summer day, I shivered uncontrollably as if I had fallen into a cold cave. The burning pain in my calf was nothing compared to the agony in my heart.

The final thread in my mind snapped.

""Fine, I'll apologize."" I laughed bitterly, tears welling up in my eyes.

Julian was taken aback momentarily and tried to reach out to me, but I dodged him.

""Dinner is ready and I've apologized. Can I go to my room to bandage my burn now?"" I shook the blistered skin, hoping he would finally leave me alone. After saying that, I ignored the mess and returned to my room.

There was a lot of noise outside the door and I heard Anne's aggrieved voice. ""I'm sorry. It's all my fault that Scarlett is angry. I'm such a jinx. I shouldn't cause you any more trouble.""

I heard the door opening as Anne ran out and everyone worriedly ran after her. The door slammed shut with a deafening noise.

Just when I thought Julian would follow her, he pushed open the door and came in. He hugged me from behind and his big hand stroked my belly.

""Scarlett, why can't you just give in to her? Anne is still like a child. You need to be more understanding. Besides, we're having a baby now. Once I've sorted out work, I'll make it up to you with a proper wedding. Don't be mad, alright?""

His voice was unexpectedly gentle, with a hint of coaxing.

""Oh, so you do remember that I'm pregnant?"" I pushed his hand away and couldn't help but sneer.

Chapter 3

Julian's smile froze as his phone buzzed in his pocket. He picked it up and Sam's voice rang loudly in the quiet room. ""Julian, hurry over! Anne fainted on the way here and we still need someone to pay for the hospital fees.""

Julian grabbed the bank card we had all been saving from the bedside table without hesitation.

""Are you out of your mind, Julian?"" I blocked his way, furious. ""You're going to take the money we saved for our baby just to pay for Anne?""

His eyes darkened with frustration and he rushed out regardless of my obstruction. ""Enough, Scarlett. Someone's life is at stake and all you care about is your petty nonsense. Stop being so selfish!""

I pounded his shoulder frantically, but he was so strong he pulled me out of the room. ""Selfish? She's your childhood friend, not mine! Why should I spend my money on her?""

Julian seemed enraged by something I said and pushed me down like an angry leopard.

The shards on the ground hadn't been cleaned up and my exhausted body collapsed onto them. Pain shot through my body as I raised my hand to find my back and arms covered in cuts.

Julian has already left, not even looking back at me.

Staring at my hands, I used the last of my strength to call for an ambulance before blacking out. In the haze of unconsciousness, I dreamed of the young boy he used to be. The one who climbed the hill with me to pray at the old church.

He clasped his hands together, his expression devout. ""I'll protect Scarlett for my whole life. If I ever break this vow, may I meet a terrible end.""

When I woke up, it was already late at night. I was the only one in the dark ward. A nurse came in, handed me a glass of water and helped me sit up.

She looked at my bandaged arms and couldn't help but sigh. ""Miss, you just had a pregnancy termination surgery and now you're like this again? Please take care of yourself and rest more.""

I closed my eyes, letting the bitterness and pain wash over me.

After thanking her quietly, I opened my phone. The first thing I saw was a post from Sam on his feed. ""Indeed, only Julian cares about Anne.""

The photo showed Julian sitting on a hospital bed. At the same time, Anne rested her head on his lap, smiling happily and contentedly. Two shameless—no wonder people say they're made for each other.

The ache in my chest turned into numbness. I forced myself to push the sadness aside. They didn't deserve my tears or my pain.

I logged into my mobile banking app and checked my account. Thankfully, the $14.000 I had saved for myself was still there. I calmly transferred the money into my account.

My marriage with Julian also came to an end with the loss of this child.

I called the general manager and asked, ""Ms. Lily, is there still a chance for me to be transferred to the headquarters?""

I was offered a promotion to headquarters because of my outstanding work a week ago. Still, I turned it down because I was pregnant and didn't want to be separated from Julian. Now, none of that mattered anymore.

""Scarlett, weren't you pregnant? Don't worry about work right now. Rest well and take care of yourself. There will be other chances in the future.""

Hearing Lily's gentle voice, I breathed deeply to calm myself. ""Ms. Lily, I lost the baby. I'd like to return to work as soon as possible.""

There was a brief silence on the other end before she spoke. ""I'll add your name back to the list. Losing a child isn't a small thing. Rest for a week and then report to headquarters.""

I agreed softly, my voice trembling a little. ""Thank you, Ms. Lily.""

Chapter 4

During my week in the hospital, Julian never came to visit.

Maybe he didn't even realize I was still pregnant. I wasn’t surprised; that was just how he was. I used to make excuses for him all the time, but not anymore.

After a week of rest, my body had recovered enough for me to be discharged. During this time, I scrolled through Anne’s social media. Every single post was about Julian.

In the photos, Anne looked like a little princess surrounded by admirers. She was always at the center, filling her table with nutritious meals and countless gifts. Meanwhile, I was alone in the hospital with nothing.

Even the pearl necklace Julian promised to buy me now shone around Anne's neck.

It was odd seeing these things again and feeling absolutely nothing.

When I got home, it was just as I'd left it. Julian had been at the hospital with Anne. He hadn't come home and probably didn't even know I had been hospitalized.

I quickly packed my things, tossing the photo from my nightstand and burning the love letters he'd written me. I took off my wedding ring and left it on the coffee table.

When I was done, I looked around the empty house. It felt like it did when we first moved in—cold and lifeless.

I lowered my gaze to the divorce papers, picked up a pen and signed my name on the back. He showed up alone before I could call Julian to come home and sign the papers. When he walked in, I was talking to a coworker about work.

My coworker asked me about my flight and I replied, ""It' tomorrow afternoon.""

I hung up as soon as I saw him walk through the door.

He frowned. ""What's happening tomorrow afternoon? A prenatal checkup?""

I put away my phone and replied flatly, ""Just work stuff. Not a checkup.""

Only then did I notice the food container in his hand. He met my gaze and handed it over.

""I'm sorry, Scarlett. Anne's been in the hospital these past few days and I couldn't leave her side. I bought you a fish soup to help you recover.""

I didn't take it because the faint smell of fish made me nauseous. We had been married for years and he still doesn't know I couldn't eat fish. How ironic, but I didn't even have the energy to argue.

""Oh, right. This is Anne's silk dress. It can't go in the washing machine. Can you hand wash it tonight?""

I suddenly had doubts as I listened to these words and looked at the person before me. I didn't know if he had changed or if I had always married someone like this.

I said through my gritted teeth. ""Just leave it there.""

""I need to grab some clothes to change into. Then I'll head back,"" he said, quickly heading into the bedroom to pack.

I took that opportunity to walk over to him with the divorce papers. ""Julian, our mortgage is all paid up. Just need your signature here.""

He didn't suspect a thing and signed his name without hesitation. I watched him leave with his bag of clothes. Then, I booked a flight two hours later.

I slipped off my wedding ring and laid the divorce papers and the pregnancy termination surgery slip on the coffee table. Those were the final things I wanted Julian to see. It was over between us.

For your first message, avoid generic openers like 'whats up' or 'hey'. Take a minute to say something specific or interesting so you actually stand out.

In the next few messages, keep it respectful and non sexual unless she brings it there first. Just have a normal conversation, ask questions, and share a bit about yourself. Try to avoid one word replies or long essays. A few solid sentences makes it easier to keep the conversation going.

The goal is to eventually meet in person, not rush things in two messages. Chat for a day or two, then suggest something simple like coffee or a casual meal.

Save flirting or sexual talk for when there is real comfort and mutual interest. Going too fast is usually a turn off. Being respectful, relaxed, and genuine already puts you ahead of most people.",3,1769471973.0,dating_advice,6,0.8,False

The pitbull is super loud and obnoxious, and overall a difficult dog. She barks constantly at every little noise or any person/dog she sees outside, and her barks are LOUD.

I unfortunately work from home, so I deal with this all day long. When my roommate is home, she doesn't really attempt to control her dog at all, just gives her a soft ""no barking!"" in a sing-songy voice.

When I'm alone with them, I get so irritated at the noise. Granted, it's not bad every single day, but on days like today it's almost unbearable. I'll be honest, sometimes I lose my temper and yell at them, because I literally don't know what else to do. It's difficult to take work calls with them yapping in the background, and I can't concentrate. 

I signed a lease so I can't simply move out any time soon. There are days when I go to a coffee shop to escape, but I can't take calls as well in public. 

I've tried covering the windows, but they always seem to get through or bark at noises they hear anyway. Plus, in my roommate's room, they destroyed the blinds so now her window is just always uncovered. I bought my roomate some hooks to install a curtain on her window (as a little ""hint""), but she has yet to do it. 

I carry a spray bottle of water around with me and squirt them if they're being too obnoxious, but that only seems to work for a few minutes. Sometimes, they get bored and lay down and don't bark for awhile, but whenever it hits that 3:00-5:00 mark and people start coming home from work, they constantly patrol the window (and of course, our apartment windows face out to the parking lot).

1qnx5n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1qnx5n4/extra_virgin_olive_oil_evoo_significantly/,Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) significantly increases lifespan. Here is how to use it and scientific evidence.,"If you could add one simple habit to your life that gives you a healthier heart, a sharper brain, glowing skin, and a longer life. Would you do it? Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is that habit. It’s not hype. It’s science-backed, ancient wisdom wrapped in a dark green bottle. People in the longest-living places on Earth. Like Ikaria, Sardinia, and Crete. Drizzle it on everything.

In these regions, known as ""Blue Zones,"" EVOO isn't just a condiment; it is the primary source of added fat. In Crete, for example, individuals have historically consumed up to liter per week. This high consumption displaces unhealthy saturated fats (like butter) and provides a constant stream of lipid-based antioxidants. It is a caloric staple, not just a garnish.

EVOO is packed with powerful polyphenols like oleocanthal and hydroxytyrosol. These natural compounds fight inflammation, protect your cells from damage, and even mimic the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen. But without the side effects. When your body isn’t constantly battling invisible fires, it can focus on healing, rebuilding, and thriving.

You can actually feel the presence of oleocanthal. If you swallow a spoonful of high-quality EVOO, you should feel a peppery scratch or a cough reflex at the back of your throat. This is a good sign! It signifies the presence of the anti-inflammatory agent. Research suggests that approximately 3.5 tablespoons of high-quality EVOO corresponds to the anti-inflammatory potency of a small dose of ibuprofen (about 10% of the adult dosage), offering chronic, low-level protection against systemic inflammation.

Heart health? EVOO’s a champion. It helps lower bad cholesterol (LDL), raise the good kind (HDL), and makes your arteries more elastic. So your blood flows like it should. One of the most powerful studies on longevity, the PREDIMED trial, showed that people who added EVOO to their Mediterranean diet had a 30% lower risk of heart attack.

It is important to note that EVOO does more than just lower LDL quantity; it protects the LDL particle from oxidation. Oxidized LDL is the specific type that sticks to artery walls and causes plaque buildup (atherosclerosis). The high monounsaturated fat content (oleic acid) combined with polyphenols prevents this oxidation, essentially ""rust-proofing"" your blood vessels.

And it’s not just the heart. EVOO crosses the blood-brain barrier. That sacred shield around your mind. And protects it. It helps prevent Alzheimer’s by reducing harmful plaques and supports clear thinking as you age. People who use EVOO regularly have sharper memory, better focus, and more stable moods. Your brain is your master switch. Protect it at all costs.

The brain is approximately 60% fat. It requires healthy lipids to maintain the integrity of neuron membranes (myelin sheaths) for fast signal transmission. Furthermore, EVOO promotes autophagy in the brain: a cellular ""cleanup"" process where cells digest and remove their own waste products, including the toxic beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer’s and dementia.

If you’re worried about blood sugar, weight, or even cancer risk. EVOO helps there too. It stabilizes insulin, keeps your appetite in check, and fights cancer cells before they can spread. It even turns on the same genes that are active during fasting or calorie restriction, like SIRT1 and AMPK. These are genes linked to DNA repair, fat burning, and better mitochondrial function.

Adding EVOO to a carbohydrate-rich meal (like pasta or bread) significantly reduces the Glycemic Index (GI) of that meal. The fat slows down stomach emptying, which means sugar hits your bloodstream more gradually rather than in a sharp spike. This prevents the subsequent ""sugar crash"" and cravings, making it an excellent tool for managing Type 2 Diabetes and weight loss.

Now, not all olive oil is equal. You want cold-pressed, extra virgin, in a dark glass bottle. Look for labels like COOC (California Olive Oil Council), PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), or PGI (Protected Geographical Indication). These show the oil’s been certified and comes from a real source. Stay away from “light,” “pure,” or anything in clear plastic. Those oils are stripped, fake, and do more harm than good. If it’s cheap and smells bland, toss it.

While certifications are great, the Harvest Date is the most critical information on the bottle. Unlike wine, olive oil does not get better with age. It is a fruit juice. Look for a bottle with a harvest date within the last 12–18 months. Also, check for Acidity levels if listed; real EVOO must be below 0.8% free fatty acidity, but the premium medicinal grade oils are often below 0.3%.

Start simple: take a tablespoon in the morning, maybe with a squeeze of lemon. Drizzle it on salads, over your rice and veggies, in soups, even in smoothies. Some folks even put it in their coffee. Just use 2 to 4 tablespoons daily, raw when possible, and you’re already shifting your health forward. Your skin will thank you. Your heart will thank you. Your future self will thank you.

A common myth is that you cannot cook with EVOO because it has a low smoke point. This is largely false for high-quality oil. High-quality EVOO is stable up to roughly 400°F (205°C) due to its high antioxidant content, which protects the fat from breaking down under heat. While raw consumption preserves 100% of the polyphenols, sautéing vegetables in EVOO actually increases the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) from the vegetables, making the meal more nutritious than steaming alone.",59,1769470931.0,immortalists,17,0.86,False

Aria's hands trembled as she reached for the flour on the top shelf of the storage pantry, her mind racing through the list of tasks Mrs. Chen had assigned her that evening. The rest of the staff had retired to their quarters an hour ago. The massive Blackwood estate was silent except for the hum of the refrigerator and her own quickening breath.

She should have known better.

She should have known he would find her.

The pantry door clicked shut behind her with a finality that made her stomach drop. She didn't need to turn around to know who it was. Her body knew before her mind did the sudden heat that flooded her core, the way her nipples hardened instantly against the thin fabric of her uniform, the wetness that pooled between her thighs without permission.

Three weeks. It had only been three weeks since that first night, and he had completely unmade her. Rebuilt her. Ruined her for anyone else.

""Did you really think you could avoid me all day?"" His voice was dark velvet, wrapping around her like a physical touch.

Aria's fingers tightened on the shelf. Every muscle in her body locked up not from fear, but from the overwhelming need that crashed through her whenever he was near.

""Mr. Blackwood, I was just""

""Damien."" His breath was hot against her neck as he closed the distance between them. ""You scream my name when I'm inside you. When I make you come so hard you forget your own name. Don't go back to formalities now.""

God, the things this man could do with just his voice. The filthy promises. The dark commands. The way he spoke to her like she was his to use, his to pleasure, his to own.

""I have work to finish,"" she whispered, but even she could hear how unconvincing it sounded. How breathless.

""No, you don't."" His hands gripped her waist, spinning her around to face him. Those steel-gray eyes pinned her in place, eyes that saw through every lie, every defense, every mask she wore.

""The only work you have tonight is taking my cock. Being a good girl for me. Let me use this pretty little body exactly how I want.""

Large hands slid up her sides as he backed her against the shelves. Damien Blackwood stood before her six feet three inches of pure masculine dominance dressed in a white shirt with sleeves rolled up to reveal corded forearms. Dark hair slightly disheveled like he'd been running his hands through it. And those eyes... God, those eyes that seemed to strip away everything until she was laid bare before him.

""I've been hard for you all fucking day,"" he growled, pressing his hips forward so she could feel exactly what he meant. The thick ridge of his erection ground against her stomach through his tailored pants.

""Watching you bend over to serve lunch. Those little glances you kept stealing at me. Did you think I didn't notice?""

""Damien, we can't not…here..the others might..""

His mouth crashed against hers, swallowing her protests. This wasn't a gentle kiss. This was claiming, possessing, devouring.

His tongue invaded her mouth with the same dominance he brought to everything else, and she melted against him like she always did, like she couldn't help doing anymore.

When had she become this person? This desperate, aching thing that lived only for his touch?

Three weeks ago, she'd never been kissed. Never been touched. Never knew her body could feel like this like it was on fire and only he had the water to put it out.

He broke the kiss, leaving her gasping. ""Turn around.""

""What?""

""Turn. Around."" Each word was a command that went straight to her core, making her clench around nothing.

Her body obeyed before her mind could protest. He pressed her forward until her palms were flat against the shelf, flour forgotten.

""Spread your legs.""

""Damien, please, if someone hears""

""Then you'll have to be very, very quiet, won't you?"" His hand slid up the back of her thigh, pushing her uniform skirt up around her waist. ""Though we both know how much you love to scream for me when I'm deep inside you. When I'm hitting that spot that makes you see stars.""

His fingers hooked into her panties the ones he'd specifically told her to wear this morning, the black lace ones he'd bought for her and yanked them down roughly. They caught around her knees, keeping her legs trapped together in a way that made her feel even more exposed, more vulnerable.

\*More his.""

""Fuck,"" he breathed, and she felt his fingers slide through her wetness. ""Already soaked. Does it turn you on?'' 

Knowing I could take you anywhere in this house? That I have taken you everywhere? The library. My office. The shower. That guest bedroom where you were supposed to be working.""

It did. God help her, it did. She'd never been the kind of girl who fantasized about things like this. Before Damien, she'd barely thought about sex at all. Her mission had been simple: infiltrate the estate, get the medicinal plant, save her mother. Clean. Clinical. Necessary.

But nothing about Damien Blackwood was clean or clinical.

""Answer me."" His hand cracked against her ass not hard enough to truly hurt, but enough to make her gasp, enough to send a shock of pleasure-pain straight to her clit.

""Yes,"" she whimpered. ""Yes, it turns me on.""

""That's my good girl."" She heard the sound of his belt buckle, the zip of his pants, and her inner muscles clenched in anticipation. Her body had learned to crave him with an addiction that terrified her.

""Now, I'm going to fuck you in this pantry while the rest of the house sleeps. And you're going to take every inch of my cock like the perfect little thing you are. Understand?""

The broad head of his cock pressed against her entrance. Even now, even after three weeks of him taking her almost daily, there was that moment of resistance. He was so big, so thick, stretching her in ways that bordered on pain even as her body wept for him.

""Deep breath, baby,"" he murmured against her ear, one hand gripping her hip hard enough to bruise while the other braced against the shelf beside her. ""You know you can take me. You always do.""

Then he thrust forward in one brutal stroke, burying himself to the hilt.

Aria's mouth opened in a silent scream, her back arching as he filled her completely. Too much. It was always too much and never enough at the same time. The stretch burned and ached and felt so fucking good she wanted to cry.

""Fuck, you're tight,"" Damien groaned, his forehead pressing against her shoulder blade as he held himself still, letting her adjust. ""Every goddamn time, you grip me like a vice. Like this pretty little cunt was made specifically for my cock. Like you were made to be mine.""

She couldn't speak. Could barely breathe. Her fingers clutched at the shelf as he withdrew slowly so slowly she could feel every ridge, every vein before slamming back in.

""Remember the first time?"" His voice was rough, strained with the effort of maintaining some control. ""You were so scared. So innocent. Didn't even know what an orgasm was. And now look at you taking my cock like you were born for it. Begging me to fuck you harder. To use you. To own you.""

He set a punishing rhythm, hips snapping forward with enough force to rattle the jars on the shelf. The obscene sound of skin slapping against skin filled the small space, mixing with their harsh breathing and her muffled whimpers.

""Hand,"" he commanded. ""Cover your mouth.""

She pressed her palm against her lips just as he angled his hips, hitting that spot inside her that made stars explode behind her eyes. The moan that tried to escape was muffled against her hand, but she could still hear it, and if she could hear it, someone else might

""That's it,"" Damien panted, his grip on her hip tightening. ""Struggle with it, baby. Try to stay quiet while I fuck this sweet pussy. God, you're squeezing me so tight. You close already?""

She nodded frantically, unable to form words. The pressure was building low in her belly, that coiling tension that she now recognized, that she'd become addicted to chasing.

His free hand snaked around her body, fingers finding her clit with the practiced ease of someone who'd mapped every inch of her. He rubbed tight circles against the swollen bud, and her legs nearly gave out.

""Come on my cock,"" he ordered, voice rough and commanding. ""Now, Aria. Let me feel it.""

The use of her real name, the one he wasn't supposed to know, the one that was part of her carefully constructed lie sent her over the edge.

Her orgasm crashed through her like a tidal wave, violent and all-consuming. Her body convulsed, inner muscles clamping down on him so hard it must have hurt, but Damien only groaned in satisfaction. She bit down on her palm to keep from screaming, tears leaking from the corners of her eyes from the sheer intensity of it.

""Fuck, yes, just like that,"" he growled, fucking her through it, prolonging the waves of pleasure until she was sure she'd pass out. ""Feel you coming apart. Feel you falling apart on my cock. Mine. All fucking mine.""

She was still trembling, still floating in that post-orgasmic haze when he pulled out suddenly. Before she could protest the emptiness, he spun her around and lifted her like she weighed nothing, setting her on the edge of the shelf.

Jars and containers crashed to the floor. Later, she'd worry about explaining that. Right now, all she could focus on was the feral look in his eyes as he gripped her thighs and spread them wide.

""Look at me,"" he demanded, positioning himself at her entrance again. ""I want to see your face when I fill you up.""

Their eyes locked as he thrust back inside, and the intimacy of the raw connection nearly shattered her. This position was deeper, more intense, and she wrapped her legs around his waist, ankles locking at the small of his back.

""There she is,"" he murmured, one hand cupping her face while the other supported her weight. ""My beautiful little liar.""

The word cut through her pleasure-drunk mind like a knife. Liar. Because that's what she was, wasn't it?

Everything about her presence here was a lie. Her name, her background, her reasons. The only truth was this the way her body responded to his, the way she'd somehow fallen completely, irrevocably for the one man she was supposed to be using.

""Don't think,"" Damien ordered, as if reading her mind. His thumb brushed across her swollen lower lip. ""Don't think about anything except how good I make you feel. How perfect we are together. How much you need this. Need me.""

He picked up the pace again, harder now, more desperate. The shelf creaked under their combined weight, but neither of them cared. His mouth found hers in a kiss that was more teeth and tongue than finesse, and she kissed him back with everything she had.

""Going to come inside you,"" he panted against her lips. ""Fill this pussy up. Mark you as mine from the inside out. You want that?""

""Yes,"" she gasped. ""Yes, please, Damien, please""

She didn't even know what she was begging for anymore. More? Less? Everything?

His hand slid between their bodies again, finding her oversensitive clit, and she shattered for the second time. This orgasm was quieter but no less intense, rolling through her in waves that seemed to go on forever.

Damien followed her over the edge with a guttural groan, his hips jerking erratically as he emptied himself inside her. She felt the hot pulse of his release, felt him marking her just like he'd promised, and some primal part of her gloried in it.

They stayed like that for long moments, both breathing hard, foreheads pressed together. His softening cock was still inside her, and she could feel their combined release beginning to leak out.

""You're going to be the death of me,"" Damien finally said, his voice rough and raw.

Aria let out a shaky laugh, still trying to catch her breath. ""Pretty sure that's my line.""

He pulled back to look at her, and there was something in his expression that made her chest tighten. Something that looked almost like tenderness beneath the possessiveness.

""Good girl"" he said quietly, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear.

He withdrew from her body carefully, and she felt the loss immediately. He tucked himself back into his pants while she slid down from the shelf on shaking legs.

""Clean yourself up,"" Damien said, his tone shifting back to that commanding register. ""But don't change your panties. I want my cum inside you for the rest of the night. I want you to feel it. Remember what we did. Remember who you belong to.""

The crude words sent a fresh wave of heat through her exhausted body.

""I should go,"" she managed, even though her legs felt like they might give out.

""You should."" But his eyes said he wasn't quite ready to let her leave. He traced a finger down her cheek, her neck, between her breasts. ""Tomorrow night. My room. I have something special planned for you.""

""What kind of special?""

His grin was absolutely wicked. ""The kind that's going to teach you just how good pleasure and a little bit of pain can feel together. The kind that's going to make you question every boundary you thought you had.""

She should be scared. Should protest. Should remember that this was all getting too complicated, too real.

Instead, all she could think was yes.

""Okay,"" she whispered.

""Good girl."" He kissed her forehead surprisingly gently after everything else. ""Now go. Before I decide I'm not done with you yet.""

Sarah...Aria...fled then, practically running from the pantry, leaving him alone with the wreckage both literal and metaphorical.

Jars lay broken on the floor. Her uniform was wrinkled and stained. Her body ached in the most delicious ways. And she could still feel him inside her, the wetness between her thighs a constant reminder of what they'd done.

She made it back to her room without encountering anyone, which felt like a miracle.

Once inside, she collapsed on her bed, staring at the ceiling, her body still humming with aftershocks.

Three weeks ago, she'd walked into this house as a virgin with a mission.

Now she was addicted to a man who somehow made her forget everything else when he touched her. Who made her body sing in ways she'd never imagined. Who was slowly, methodically, thoroughly claiming every piece of her.

And the worst part? She didn't want him to stop.

Even though she knew it was all going to end in disaster.

Even though she was lying to him with every breath.

Even though her mother was dying,and she should be focused solely on her mission.

She wanted him. Craved him. Was becoming the obsessed, desperate thing he was shaping her into.

What have I become? she thought as sleep finally claimed her.

But deep down, she already knew

the answer.

His.

She'd become his.

And there was no going back from that.

Three weeks earlier…

...

Three Weeks Earlier...

The fluorescent lights of St. Mary's Hospital flickered overhead, casting sickly shadows across the worn linoleum floor. Aria Chen sat in the waiting room, her leg bouncing with nervous energy as she watched the second hand on the wall clock tick forward with agonizing slowness.

4:47 PM.

Dr. Morrison was thirteen minutes late.

She told herself that was normal. Doctors ran behind schedule all the time. It didn't mean anything. It didn't mean the test results were bad.

It didn't mean her mother was dying.

Stop it, she commanded herself, digging her nails into her palms hard enough to leave crescent-shaped marks. Don't think like that.

But she couldn't help it. She'd seen her mother's face growing paler over the past six months, watched her vibrant, unstoppable force of nature reduced to a frail woman who could barely climb a flight of stairs without stopping to catch her breath. The cough that wouldn't go away. The weight loss. The way her hands trembled when she thought Aria wasn't looking.

Something was very, very wrong.

Aria's phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, seeing a notification from one of her underground art buyers: When can we expect the next piece? Collectors are asking. - M.R.

She dismissed it without responding. Her various identities: the artist, the hacker, the medical consultant all seemed impossibly distant right now. None of those skills, none of that brilliance, could help her mother.

And that helplessness was eating her alive.

""Miss Chen?""

Aria's head snapped up. Dr. Morrison stood in the doorway a middle-aged woman with kind eyes and the sort of gentle expression that made Aria's stomach drop like a stone.

That was the face doctors wore when they had to deliver bad news.

""Please, come in."" Dr. Morrison gestured toward her office.

Aria's legs felt like lead as she stood and followed. The hallway seemed to stretch on forever, each step taking her closer to words she didn't want to hear. The office was small and cluttered with medical journals, framed diplomas on the wall, a dying fern on the windowsill that somehow felt prophetic.

""Sit down, please."" Dr. Morrison settled behind her desk, and Aria noticed she didn't immediately reach for the folder of test results. Another bad sign.

Doctors who had good news didn't need time to gather themselves.

""How is she?"" Aria asked, her voice coming out smaller than she'd intended. ""My mother. The tests, what did they show?""

Dr. Morrison's expression softened with sympathy, and Aria felt something crack inside her chest.

""I'm afraid the results aren't what we hoped for,"" the doctor said gently. ""Your mother has what we call Wasting Syndrome a rare degenerative condition that affects multiple organ systems simultaneously.""

The words didn't make sense at first. They seemed to float in the air between them, refusing to land, refusing to become real.

""Wasting Syndrome,"" Aria repeated numbly. ""I've never heard of it.""

""Most people haven't. It's extremely rare we see perhaps a dozen cases worldwide each year."" Dr. Morrison pulled up images on her computer screen, showing deteriorating tissue samples that made Aria's medical knowledge kick in despite her emotional turmoil. ""The condition causes the body to essentially attack itself, breaking down muscle tissue, weakening the cardiovascular system, compromising immune function.""

Aria stared at the images, her brilliant mind already processing the implications. Already understanding what the doctor was about to say.

""Without treatment, patients typically have six to eight months.""

Six to eight months.

Half a year.

Less than a year.

Her mother the woman who had raised her alone after her father died, who had worked three jobs to put Aria through school, who had sacrificed everything so her daughter could have opportunities she'd never had, was going to die in less than a year.

""What's the treatment?"" Aria heard herself ask. Her voice sounded strange, distant, like it belonged to someone else. ""Surgery? Chemotherapy? There has to be something""

""Traditional treatments are largely ineffective,"" Dr. Morrison said, and there was genuine regret in her tone. ""We can manage symptoms, make her comfortable, but we can't stop the progression. The disease is too aggressive, affects too many systems simultaneously.""

Comfortable. That was code for palliative care. For giving up.

""No."" The word came out sharp, almost angry. ""No, there has to be something. This is the twenty-first century. We have treatments for everything. Gene therapy, experimental drugs, clinical trials""

""I understand this is difficult to accept""

""You don't understand anything."" Aria was on her feet now, hands clenched into fists at her sides. ""That's my mother. The only family I have. There has to be something we can do. Someone who specializes in this. A different hospital, a different country I'll pay whatever it costs, I'll""

She stopped abruptly, the fight draining out of her as quickly as it had come. Pay whatever it costs? With what money? She was a twenty-four-year-old with multiple income streams from her various identities, sure, but barely thirty thousand in savings total. The medical bills from these tests alone would wipe out a significant chunk of that.

""There is one thing,"" Dr. Morrison said quietly.

Aria's head snapped up, hope flaring painfully in her chest. ""What? What is it?""

""It's not... officially sanctioned. And the chances of accessing it are virtually nonexistent."" The doctor hesitated, as if weighing whether she should continue. ""There's a medicinal plant called Vitalis Radix. Ancient Chinese texts refer to it as the 'Root of Life.' A handful of studies from the 1970s suggest it might have properties that could slow or even reverse the progression of Wasting Syndrome.""

Aria's mind was already racing, filing through everything she knew about rare medicinal plants. ""Then why isn't it being used? Why aren't we giving it to her right now?""

""Because it's nearly extinct. The plant requires very specific growing conditions, particular soil composition, precise temperature ranges, exact humidity levels. It can't be synthesized in a lab, and every attempt to cultivate it outside its natural habitat has failed.""

Dr. Morrison pulled up an article on her computer. ""As far as I know, there are only three or four places in the world where it's successfully cultivated, and none of them make it available for medical use.""

""Where?"" Aria leaned forward, her hands gripping the edge of the desk.

""Where is it grown?""

""Aria..""

""Where?""

Dr. Morrison sighed, recognizing the determination in her patient's daughter. She'd probably seen it before the desperation of people who refused to accept the inevitable.

""The largest known cultivation is on the Blackwood Estate, about twenty miles outside the city. They're a very wealthy, very private family. The patriarch, Charles Blackwood, started growing it decades ago as part of a botanical collection hobby of the extremely rich, that sort of thing. But they don't sell it. Don't donate it.

Don't make it available for research. It's purely for their own..."" She gestured vaguely. ""Whatever purposes.""

Blackwood.

The name echoed in Aria's mind like a bell. She knew that name. Everyone in the city knew that name.

The Blackwood family was old money the kind of wealth that transcended normal understanding. Real estate, technology, pharmaceuticals, shipping they had fingers in every pie, and their influence extended into political circles at the highest levels. Charles Blackwood had built an empire, and his grandson, Damien, was continuing and expanding the legacy.

Damien Blackwood.

Aria had seen his face in business magazines, on the news, in those tabloid articles about the city's most eligible bachelors. Impossibly handsome, ruthlessly intelligent, and notoriously private. He'd taken over as CEO of Blackwood Enterprises three years ago at age twenty-eight and had somehow managed to double the company's value while maintaining an iron grip on his personal life.

No scandals. No public relationships. No apparent weaknesses.

The Blackwood Estate was legendary a sprawling compound on the outskirts of the city, protected by state-of-the-art security and an army of staff. Getting an audience with Damien Blackwood would be nearly impossible for someone like her.

But getting into the estate...

An idea began forming in Aria's mind. Dangerous. Reckless. Probably illegal.

But…possible.

""Thank you, Dr. Morrison,"" Aria said suddenly, her decision made. ""For everything. I'd like copies of all my mother's test results, please. And any research you have on Vitalis Radix.""

The doctor looked at her with concern. ""Aria, whatever you're thinking""

""I'm thinking I'm not going to let my mother die without trying everything."" She met the doctor's gaze steadily. ""Even the impossible things.""

""The Blackwood family doesn't just give that plant away. They're... protective of their collection. Security is extreme. And even if you could somehow get access, harvesting it incorrectly could kill the specimen. It's not as simple as""

""I understand."" Aria's mind was already working through logistics, possibilities, risks. ""But I have to try.""

Dr. Morrison studied her for a long moment, then nodded slowly. ""I'll have my assistant prepare copies of everything. But Aria be careful. People have tried to steal from the Blackwood Estate before. It never ends well.""

I'm not like other people, Aria thought but didn't say.

She'd spent her entire life being underestimated, the poor girl who somehow got a full scholarship to medical school, the quiet student who turned out to be a genius, the unassuming woman who could hack government databases or forge documents that would pass any inspection.

She'd been with many people, worn many masks, and survived impossible situations.

This would just be one more.

Two hours later, Aria sat in her mother's hospital room, watching the woman sleep. Mei Chen looked so small in the bed, her once-vibrant face pale against the white pillows. Her black hair, now streaked with more silver than Aria remembered, was pulled back in a loose braid.

She looked fragile. Breakable.

When did that happen? When had her indomitable mother become this frail creature?

""You're staring again, baby girl.""

Aria started. Her mother's eyes were open, dark and still sharp despite the illness ravaging her body.

""I'm not staring. I'm observing. There's a difference.""

""Mmm."" Mei's lips quivered with a small smile. ""And what are you observing?""

That you're dying. That I'm losing you. That I can't imagine a world without you in it.

""That you need to eat more,"" Aria said instead, forcing lightness into her tone. ""You're getting too thin. I'm going to bring you real food tomorrow, not this hospital garbage.""

""The food here isn't so bad.""

""Mother, yesterday you told me the soup tasted like dishwater mixed with regret.""

Mei laughed, then coughed a wet, rattling sound that made Aria's chest tighten. When the fit passed, she reached for the cup of water on her bedside table with trembling hands.

Aria was there instantly, holding the cup to her mother's lips.

""I can do it myself,"" Mei protested weakly.

""I know you can. Humor me.""

After she'd drunk her fill, Mei settled back against the pillows with a sigh. Her eyes were still so sharp, still so knowingly studying her daughter's face.

""The doctor told you.""

It wasn't a question.

""Yes,"" Aria said softly.

""And?""

""And we're going to fight it. There are treatments, clinical trials, experimental therapies""

""Aria."" Her mother's hand found hers, squeezing with surprising strength. ""Don't lie to me. I've been dying for months. I knew before the doctors did. I can feel it.""

""Don't say that.""

""Why not? It's true."" Mei's expression was calm, accepting in a way that made Aria want to scream. ""We all die eventually, baby girl. Some of us just get less time than others.""

""No."" Aria pulled her hand away, standing abruptly. ""No, you don't get to give up. You don't get to just accept this. We're going to find a treatment. We're going to fix this.""

""Aria..""

""I mean it, Mother. I'm not letting you go without a fight.""

Mei was quiet for a long moment, studying her daughter with an expression Aria couldn't quite read. Pride? Worry? Sadness?

""You're so much like your father,"" she finally said.

Aria froze. Her mother almost never talked about her father. The man who'd died when Aria was three so young she had no memories of him, only stories her mother rarely shared.

""What do you mean?""

""Stubborn. Brilliant. Convinced you can solve any problem if you just work hard enough, think long enough, and refuse to give up."" Mei smiled sadly. ""He was like that too. It's what got him killed, in the end.""

""What do you mean?"" Aria moved closer to the bed. ""You never talk about how he died.""

""Because it hurts. Because I watched him destroy himself trying to save someone who couldn't be saved."" Mei's eyes were distant, lost in memory. ""His sister was dying. Cancer. He was convinced he could find a cure if he just worked harder, tried more things. He pushed himself until there was nothing left. Until his body gave out from exhaustion and stress.""

The words hit Aria like a physical blow. She'd never known this about her father. Had never known he'd died trying to save someone.

Just like she was about to risk everything to save her mother.

""Promise me something, Aria."" Mei's hand reached for hers again. ""Promise me you won't do anything reckless. Don't throw your life away trying to save mine. Don't become so obsessed with fighting death that you forget to live.""

Aria couldn't make that promise. Wouldn't make it.

Instead, she leaned down and kissed her mother's forehead. ""Get some rest. I'll be back tomorrow.""

""Aria""

""I love you, Mother. More than anything in this world.""

She left before her mother could extract any promises she had no intention of keeping.

...

Aria's apartment was a small studio in the cheaper part of town where sirens were a nightly lullaby and the neighbors' arguments bled through thin walls. But it was hers, and more importantly, it housed everything she needed for her various identities.

Three computer monitors sat on a desk cobbled together from IKEA parts and stolen milk crates. Medical textbooks lined shelves alongside art supplies and advanced mathematics journals. In the corner, several canvases leaned against the wall, her paintings, done under the pseudonym

""A. Ren.""

Wealthy collectors paid thousands for her work without ever knowing the artist was a twenty-four-year-old woman who lived in a studio apartment and sometimes survived on ramen.

She had many faces, many identities. It had always been a survival mechanism being the smart girl who could hack systems, the artist who could forge documents, the medical prodigy who'd finished her degree at twenty. Multiple skill sets meant multiple income streams, and after growing up poor, watching her mother work herself to exhaustion, Aria had vowed never to be helpless.

Never to be at the mercy of circumstances she couldn't control.

Now, all those skills were going to serve one purpose: infiltration.

She pulled up everything she could find on the Blackwood Estate. Property records, tax documents, utility bills, satellite images. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, pulling data from sources that weren't exactly legal but were definitely useful.

The estate was massive over two hundred acres, with the main house alone spanning thirty thousand square feet. Gardens, greenhouses, a private lake, staff quarters, guest houses. Security was top-of-the-line: cameras, motion sensors, biometric locks on sensitive areas, regular patrols by armed guards.

This wasn't just a home. It was a fortress.

And somewhere in that fortress was a greenhouse containing Vitalis Radix.

""Okay,"" she muttered to herself, opening a new window. ""Employment records.""

It took her ninety minutes to hack into the estate's private HR system longer than usual, which meant someone had paid good money for their digital security. The firewalls were sophisticated, layered, designed to keep out exactly the kind of person Aria was.

But not sophisticated enough.

She scrolled through employee records, looking for patterns. Turnover rates, typical positions, background check requirements. The Blackwoods employed over fifty people: housekeepers, groundskeepers, chefs, security personnel, personal assistants, drivers.

There.

A housekeeper position had recently opened up someone named Margaret Sullivan had retired after twenty years of service. They'd be looking for a replacement soon, and given the timing, they'd probably want someone who could start immediately.

Aria opened another window and began constructing her new identity.

Sarah Mitchell. Twenty-two years old. Impeccable references from wealthy families in other cities families she'd researched enough to fake correspondence from. Experience in high-end household management. Spotless background check.

It took her the rest of the night, but by sunrise, Sarah Mitchell existed in every database that mattered. School records going back to high school. Previous employment with verifiable references (people she'd carefully prepared to vouch for this fictional person). Social media presence dating back three years carefully curated posts about coffee and sunsets and inspirational quotes that said absolutely nothing about who ""Sarah"" really was.

It was one of her better identities. Clean. Believable. Completely untraceable back to Aria Chen.

""Sorry, Damien Blackwood,"" she murmured, looking at a photo of him on her screen.

Even in a still image, he was striking. Sharp cheekbones that could cut glass. Intense gray eyes that seemed to see through the camera lens. Dark hair swept back from a face that looked like it had been carved by someone who understood exactly how devastating male beauty could be. He wore power like other men wore cologne naturally, effortlessly, with an edge of danger that probably made smart women run the other direction.

Aria had never been particularly smart when it came to self-preservation.

""You're about to hire a very dedicated new maid,"" she said to his image. ""One with enough skills to rob you blind if she wanted to. But don't worry, I only want one thing. One plant. And then I'll disappear like I was never there.""

She didn't let herself think about the ethics of it. Didn't let herself worry about what would happen if she was caught. This was about survival her mother's survival and Aria would do whatever it took.

Even if it meant lying to one of the most powerful men in the country.

Even if it meant infiltrating his home under false pretenses.

Even if it meant stealing something irreplaceable.

Her phone buzzed with a text from the hospital: Your mother is asking for you.

Aria grabbed her jacket and headed for the door, but not before glancing back at Damien Blackwood's photo on her screen.

Those eyes seemed to follow her, seemed to see through every lie she was constructing.

I'll get that plant, she promised silently. No matter what it takes. No matter who I have to deceive.

She had no way of knowing then that ""whatever it takes"" would cost her far more than she could have imagined.

That the man whose home she planned to infiltrate would become her addiction, her obsession, her undoing.

That she would give him her body, her innocence, parts of herself she didn't know existed and that losing him would hurt worse than anything she'd ever experienced.

But that revelation was still three weeks away.

For now, she was just a desperate daughter with a mission and a

plan.

Nothing nothing was going to stop her.

Not even the dangerous, beautiful man who was already watching her in ways she couldn't yet imagine.

1qnwz60,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qnwz60/introducing_dreamofmeeu_made_with_love_by_yours/,Introducing dreamofme.eu - made with love by yours truly ✨,"Hey everyone,

I'm excited to finally share something that's been on my mind for years: [dreamofme.eu](http://dreamofme.eu) . A platform dedicated to exploring and sharing our dreams together.

For the longest time, I've wanted to create a space like this, but it just wasn't technically feasible. Thanks to the amazing technological advances of recent years, it's finally possible, and I couldn't be more thrilled to share it with this community.

[Dream of Me - Someone dreamed about you](https://preview.redd.it/qmkwyrpg4sfg1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58d2061aae175c58069131c5d2c5a4a4929800a)

  


Have you ever wondered:

* If other people have had similar dreams to yours, but had no way to share and discover them?
* If there's an overarching theme running through dreams across the world?
* If the person you met at the coffee shop also dreamed of you last night?

If you've ever wanted to chat about your night dreams, make sense of them, or simply connect with others who are curious about this mysterious part of our lives, this might be the place for you.

I'm looking for beta testers! The app is completely free and secure (with premium features planned for the future). I'd love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and dream stories as we build this together.

Thank you all for any feedback you might have. I hope you'll enjoy exploring [dreamofme.eu](http://dreamofme.eu) as much as I've enjoyed creating it.

Sweet dreams, 😉

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

First post on reddit, I'm just really lost and cannot ask my friends for advice. It sounds bad and it is bad. I met her a year and a half ago, on an online forum, where I was kind of popular. She approached me and I asked about her age - she told me she was 19 (back then). This was still very young for me, but we formed a friendship, there was occasional flirting, but it was mostly jokes while playing games together. She lives across the country from me, so while there were two times we were supposed to meet up, it didn't work out and we lost contact around december 2024. 

August 2025 - she's randomly in my city and we meet up for a coffee and some food. We instantly click, we are both the same type of autistics and we start to text every day. At this point I'm convinced she's 20 - when I ask about why she's still in school, she tells me its because of her mental health, she didn't pass some stuff. I don't question it. 

We start travelling to our cities - not too often, but often enough. We cuddle to sleep, flirt, talk deeply. It's difficult, because we both have a lot of problems, she's addicted to some substances, but doesn't take them when spending time with me. She also at one point goes to a mental hospital for couple of weeks. Her health is declining, and while I'm not her only support system, I feel responsible. 

Beginning of january and we have a big talk about our feelings and that it's mutual. We meet up more times, we kiss, we are together. And then, after a week together, after me soft launching our relationship to my friends, she texts me the truth - she has been lying about her age. She's 18. She was 17 when we started texting. 

It hasn't even been 24h since she told me, I told her I need some time to think what to do about us. It hurts so bad, but I have to break this off. Not only because of her age, but also because she was lying to me for so long. But I'm afraid of how to approach this, what to tell her. I'm scared of what she might do - to herself mostly. I'm scared of another heartbreak, of never meeting someone like her again, but also scared of breaking her heart. 

I'm also scared of what I became. I'm angry at myself for missing obvious signs. I'm afraid I might have groomed her into the relationship. That she didn't know what she was doing and I took advantage of her. I'm afraid I became like the girl, who was grooming me when I was 15. I feel awful. I'm scared to tell my friends - considering not telling them, because I'm ashamed of myself. 

That's why I'm posting here for anonymous advice. What do I even write to her - ""you broke my boundary""? ""you lied to me""? ""you are too young for me, i am too old for you""? ""we need some time no contact"" (and then never break the no contact)? What if she harms herself because of my decision? Possibly write to her friend - the only one I have befriended - so she can make sure she will survive -- would that be a bad idea? 

Sorry for the post being so long, needed to get it out of my head. Thanks for reading. ",1,1769470121.0,relationship_advice,12,0.53,False

I've tried to do a lot of research on reddit before asking for feedback so I wouldn't be coming to you without having done some work in advance. However, I'd still love any thoughts that anyone might have. A couple of things I'll say up front (and I'm sorry that I'm probably formatting this terribly):

1. We are staying at the big Hilton resorts- Waikoloa Village and Hawaiian Village- due to my husband having a ton of travel points through work. I know there are pros and cons to this, and I appreciate all that I've read in the forom!
2. I tend to overplan, so I may I have packed too much in here.
3. I really love poke and sushi so would really like to maximize that, but my family might not want to eat those EVERY meal.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Proposed itinerary**

*Thursday*\- Arrive at Hilton Waikoloa Village, settle in, dinner at Lava Lava Beach Club or resort

*Friday-* Hapuna beach & lunch at Westin resort; Back to Hilton and explore Waikoloa ponds; Dinner at Umekes

*Tuesday-* Travel to Oahu. Hula Dog lunch, settle in at resort, Monkeypod dinner (if time for both)

*Wednesday*\- Pearl Harbor. Maguro Spot lunch; Sunset whale watching tour; Roy's Waikiki dinner

I have heard about and read about this playbook, including Saul Alinsky.  It felt surreal that I was suddenly maybe hearing it in real-time.  

Like I said I cannot prove anything, so this can only serve as an alert to others to be cognizant of the same thing.  I have usually laughed at MAGAs saying this is an attempted communist takeover.  Now I am not laughing so loud.

I've been having a lot of fun trying to get into script writing since starting the new semester (and some new personal habits that have been stealing my usual writing time!) and I really wanted to write this Part 3 for one of my favorite characters. If you're curious, [Part 1 can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASMRScriptHaven/comments/1pxeyu9/childhood_best_friend_comforts_you_after_a_long/), while [Part 2 can be found here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASMRScriptHaven/comments/1q2n4ua/childhood_best_friend_needs_you_to_lean_on_part_2/) This time, we're venturing into awkward first date territory!

**Premise:**

*For two people that have known each other since they were just kids, a snap decision - ""let's go out to dinner"" - feels strangely out of sync with everything they've always found comes naturally. After years of late-night texts and coffee on park benches with your childhood best friend, choosing a* ***real*** *restaurant for a ""first date"" should only make things more official. Instead, everything from the noise to the fancy clothes is overwhelming, and each half-hearted attempt at small talk ends up making you both more uneasy. As the dinner progresses (or, rather, slowly crumbles), you both realize that maybe the intimacy you've shared for years doesn't need to be changed just because it's finally been named.*

I'm looking to move into a 2 bed/2 bath place on the east side (ideally Silverlake/Los Feliz area) in June or July this year. I currently live in Culver City and my commute is starting to become unbearable. If possible, I would love to connect with a roommate that has a similar/complementary living style so we can curate our space together and exist harmoniously!

**About Me:** I'm a 30F psychotherapist who identifies as queer and neurodivergent. I currently live alone and I love creating a cozy environment that feels restful to return to. My hobbies include playing video games, outdoorsy activities, watching shows to decompress, artsy projects, baking, and chilling with friends. My work schedule is 4 days per week in office (anywhere from 10 AM - 8 PM on weekdays) and one day remote work (Fridays). I tend to spend a lot of time at home when I'm not working, though I usually like to keep to myself because my whole day is spent talking to people. Even so, I would ideally like a roommate who would be happy to spend time together socially sometimes.

**Ideal Roommate:** I have a slight preference for a female/femme roommate, though I'm open to any gender as long as we get along well. Ideally you would be someone open to collaborating on decor/furniture for the common areas and have a direct style of communication to address any household concerns that arise. I occasionally might want to host friends for small gatherings, so please be open to having people over on some evenings.

**Ideal Home:** My non-negotiable needs for a home are - it must be a 2 bed/2 bath, it must have access to at least one parking space, and there must be a decent-sized kitchen. Some wants are in-unit washer/dryer and more intimate building with fewer apartment units overall. I would also like to pay no more than $1500 - $1600 for my portion of the living costs. 

  
Please reach out if you're interested in getting to know each other and potentially looking for a place together! I would like to meet in-person for a coffee/tea to get a feel for whether we'll be a good fit together. Thanks for reading!",3,1769469235.0,LAHousing,0,1.0,False

Looking for casual dates only (at first!). Coffee, food trips, laag, sunset walks, “one quick date” that turns into hours.

I’m very much into matcha and pastries 🍵🥐 Quiet cafes, flaky croissants, and sitting across from someone I enjoy talking to. If you know good cafes with legit matcha and flaky croissants, you’re already winning. Matcha dates are elite, argue with the wall.

Music taste matters a lot. If we swap playlists and it slaps, that’s flirting already. I’m into soul-leaning pop, indie, R&B-adjacent, OPM, pop punk, and a bit of K-pop. Think warm vocals, good lyrics, and songs you play during late-afternoon walks. Playlist exchanges are my love language.

like a voice to whom no name was ever given)

———

Every morning I wake up in the sticky embraces of dawn, in dream-images raped by the sunrise.

I don’t remember most of them – and that’s lucky.

And then, gasping from thirst, I find excuses for each new day, in which I do not exist – exercising in futility, inventing meaning each time anew – like giving names to clouds.

Self-defence through indifference, looking in the mirror and seeing a tired, alien face…

Asking yourself – what did I forget here, in this world?

In a world that’s been sold and cursed, where rivers run thick with blood and tears…

In a place where no one awaits your return…

Drinking coffee in the morning, turning into liquid dirt in the mouth.

Sensing the stale air of cafés, watching dust settle like snowflakes…

Eating food that lost its taste back in the soil, with a faint note of rot still clinging to it.

Talking about feelings – the kind you only know from Netflix and YouTube…

But how can you feel anything real when your whole world is just a wasteland?

A black, sloshing hole in the chest – that’s all that’s left…

One garden still remains, but spring will never return…

I became a mannequin amid the empty hustle of the world – made of ghosts, likes,

and endless consumption…

Where people move on autopilot: born, work, die –

caught in the loop of serving the system.

Home. Work. Weekend.

Only a false echo reaches from the truth.

Sometimes it seems to me that when it rains, houses turn gray – like giant tombstones

for those still alive, outwardly.

“Alright, hold on – let me just find my positivity mask in this handleless suitcase of mine, and we’ll continue…”

I say to everyone:

“Hello, how are you?”

Then cheerfully reply:

“I’m good, thanks” –

even though no one really cares anymore.

But I keep playing this performance, where the smile is a grimace of pain, and mechanical, soulless existence is elevated to a virtue – a model to imitate.

Vows and promises?

Lying in the gutter like filthy underwear.

Lust has buried love and the sense of beauty.

Children – just regret, a burden, and a tool of manipulation for personal gain.

I’m already tired of screaming into a leaden sky,

its color soaked in the will not to live.

And still – even here, in this world, no matter how bright the light, it can never replace the warmth of living presence.

I don’t know if everyone truly needs a living soul…

Not for salvation.

Not for support.

But to be in co-presence.

To be felt – not merely consumed.

To have someone look into your eyes, not just at you.

Perhaps for me, it will be “the Late Companion” –

a voice that comes when no one else answers anymore.

I stand on the shore, stripped bare by meaninglessness.

I hear the waves crashing – but it’s only the sea of sorrow…

What am I doing here?

Despair has sunk its claws deep into my soul.

Loneliness – its shroud soaked through with tears…

Ah yes, I forgot about hope…

There she is – I see her ugly silhouette, holding my hand.",1,1769469139.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

This really stressed me out as I love everything to be perfect ad then I got all paranoid it was all my fault and all my colleagues were mad at me and I would loose my job etc it was awful to be honest, I was near in tears to the point managers pulled me aside and asked if I was okay. I just couldn't cope with feeling like I had let my colleagues down even though I was reminded so many times, it was the whole department not one person and the auditor was known for being very strict and picky !

Then when I came home from work, after dinner we got a call to tell us my granny had been rushed to hospital with a bleed on her brain. They live around an hour away and I can't drive and dad was fucked so there is very little we can do until the morning. My Granda is now left in the house by himself whilst my uncle and the carers take my granny to the hospital. Family friends who live closer to my granny are with my grandad for tonight and then hopefully my dad will do the right thing and go see him tomorrow. I am really worried about my granny and lost all my appetite so I am super proud of myself for pushing through this and still eating, it is proof I can do it and I guess not being able to drive to see my grandad gave me motivation because honestly I just felt so shit and useless. This wasn't help by dad telling me I am useless, nasty etc the usual drunk ramblings. He also started being so nasty about my granny and grandad just telling me it was bound to happen etc and that it isn't our responsibility. I don't understand how he can say these things. I also found out last night when he was drunk last night he lied about some pretty fucked up things, I am not surprised tbh, I knew they were lies and I am glad I got him to admit it before he was fucked tonight. But at the same time it hurts he just brushes these lies off and almost just laughs like it is no big deal.

I also had bloods this morning, and received a phone call regarding them this afternoon but missed it (I assume they were off). She left a message and said she would phone back in the morning, so I assume if they were REALLY bad they would do something more urgently, but that is another stress. UGH. I have been a little dizzy recently but also physically my appetite has been so low, especially in the evenings, probably all the anxiety though from the current living situation etc. Just hoping at the minute mainly my granny is okay and my grandad, my bloods are okay tomorrow when and if she phones and I don't loose my job. I’ll also be so honest - mentally and physically I feel exhausted. Hope you all are well!",9,1769468993.0,recoveryplates,10,0.91,False
