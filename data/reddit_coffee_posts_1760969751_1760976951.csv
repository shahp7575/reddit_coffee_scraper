How could a stimulant help with PTSD? 

I have ADHD and PTSD and recently started dexmethylphenidate. It helps my ADHD, but I can't say that it helps my PTSD at all (if anything, it makes it worse). That said, I still continue to drink caffeine (2-3 cups of coffee per day). Perhaps the combination of both is triggering my PTSD? 

Have any of you used methylphenidate for PTSD? Is it your preferred choice for someone who has both PTSD and ADHD?

You know those days when you think nothing interesting is going to happen?
Yeah… this was not one of those days.

It started off innocent enough. Just two sisters scrolling through social media, judging TikToks,twitter posts and insta sipping iced coffee.

Then we came across The Image.

It was one of those random memes about “FeetFinder,” and we were giggling like twelve-year-olds. Who even uses that? People actually selling pictures of their feet? Couldn’t be us. Couldn’t be anyone we know.

…Right?

THE SEARCH THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

Curiosity, as they say, killed the cat. And in our case, it killed our peace of mind.
We decided, for absolutely no good reason, to search our mom’s name.
You know, just for laughs.

The moment we hit enter, our souls left our bodies.
Because there she was.
Our mom.
On. FeetFinder.

At first, we didn’t believe it.
“No way. That’s a coincidence,” my sister said, blinking like she’d seen a ghost.
But then we saw the unmistakable floral carpet. The same one that’s been in our living room since 2005.
That was her.
That was our mother’s foot.

(For extra clarity a picture of her face was the profile picture).

At that point, we were no longer just daughters , we were unwilling participants in a multi-generational foot empire.

We didn’t know what to do. Laugh? Cry? Start an OnlyFans agency for the family?
We looked at each other and just lost it.
The kind of laughter that leaves you gasping for air and questioning every life choice that led you here.

“Do you think she knows what it is?”
“I don’t know, maybe she thinks it’s like Etsy but for toes?”

The more we thought about it, the funnier  and weirder , it got.
Our mom, the woman who still types “www.”
 before every website, was out here hustling on FeetFinder.

We debated whether to say something.
Like, how do you even start that conversation?

“Hey Mom, so… we accidentally found your side hustle while Googling memes.”

No matter how we phrased it in our heads, it sounded like the world’s most awkward family meeting waiting to happen.
So we didn’t.
At least not yet.

Instead, we made a pact:
We would observe from afar, support her unknowingly entrepreneurial spirit, and maybe — just maybe — start a group chat called “Feet Dynasty.”

So now, every time we see her painting her toenails with suspicious precision, we just exchange a silent look that says:
“Respect the grind.”

***There Was A Bear In Our Woods***

Its name was Mr. Busy Buster Bear. Figured it was best to get god awful part out of the way now.

All it takes is one tragic moment to change the direction of your life. From the fun kid who is always adventurous to the weird kid too scared to do anything with his friends. Growing up I expected my life to be normal, but this haunting moment had other plans. It never let me go.

As an Iowan I don’t have a lot of great and grand stories. All we have in Iowa is Adventure Land, The Field of Dreams, and humidity. Humidity clings to you like a second skin… an invisible weight that intensifies the heat and creeps across your body, refusing to let go. There is a popular saying. It’s not the heat that gets you, it’s the humidity.

Mark Twain once said,

“Climate is what we expect, weather is what we get.”

Still, like any kid, I had plenty of moments that stuck with me while growing up in the great Midwest.

I remember summer trips to the Wisconsin Dells. The Water Park capital of the world! I remember playing baseball, mostly in the outfield, where I could space out without anyone noticing. I struck out more times than I care to admit. My friends and I once tried smoking tea leaves in eighth grade, convinced it would do something. It didn’t. We were idiots.

Then there was the fight I got into with a friend as we got off the school bus—the first real jolt. I threw a punch, wild, and clumsy. My fists didn’t work the way I thought they would. The world gets disoriented. Adrenaline doesn’t feel like it does in the movies, you don’t become a hyper focused killing machine. It’s not empowering, it’s disorienting. I felt my balance go, my vision blurring at the edges. The sick moves I thought I’d pull off never happened. There was no thinking, only action. Well, as much action as a 12 year can pull off in a fight.

But that fight wasn’t the first time I felt that rush. The first time was when I was a child. It wasn’t with a friend, it was with a stranger. My body sensed the danger before my brain could catch up. A numbness kicked in. As I ran, I remember thinking how hard it was to stay on my feet. Why would adrenaline—something meant to help me—end up slowing me down? That confusion was something I’d long forgotten…

What we get is usually far from what we expect.

**Chapter 2**

To face evil at a young age is almost unimaginable. You know who the “bad guys” are, but you don’t understand evil. You learn about them in history class, you see them in the news, but never face to face. 

A bear in the woods doesn’t *sound* wrong, but it was. That small green, fluffy bear and his weird-ass voice should not have been anywhere near those woods. I would be the unlucky soul to stumble upon it.

Many of us grew up playing in the woods. There was never a lot to do besides that. We would set up a small campsite and hide from the DNR. Plenty of us lived in the area, so there was no shortage of activities in the woods. We even tried to set up an airsoft gun league where we would shoot in the woods. Our parents were a bit weird about it from 2005 to 2007. Apparently, some kids went missing in the “area.” While it was still hours away, it was in the Central and Eastern part of the state. This was enough to make headlines and cause fear in any small town.

**‘Third Child Vanishes Near Black Hawk County — All Last Seen in the Woods. Is Something Hunting Them?’**

As a kid I never paid much attention to those headlines. I was more of a history fan. American history was always a highlight. It would usually spiral into something new, some president quotes a great general, and now I’m learning about how Britain started the rumor of Napoleon of France being so short, and it still lasts to this day. Early propaganda that stuck.

**‘Great General, Not-So-Tall Tale: The Truth Behind Napoleon’s Height’**

I always hate talking about my run in with the bear. Why me? My family always wanted me to just get over it, but I always waited as long as possible to talk about this. Even with a professional I’d start telling them history facts instead.

Sometimes facing a haunting memory or a daunting task feels more manageable by waiting. That’s never true. It always makes it worse. When I was eleven, I was still scared of a lot of things. I was usually scared to go into the woods alone, especially if it was raining (thank you, slasher film *2006 Hatchet).* I don’t remember being scared of things before we moved out near the woods. Maybe it was the house? I was a bit of a scared kid before I met Mr. Busy Buster Bear, but he made things worse.

It was early 2007. I was eleven. The other kids who went missing were between the ages of 5 and 8. I would have been the oldest. I guess beggars can’t be choosers, but trying to talk to an 11-year-old was pretty stupid on Mr. Busy Buster Bear’s part.

I was scouting out a new spot to camp after our last site was stomped out by the DNR. It was a bit later in the day, but the sun would still be out for some time. That’s when I heard it, just a few trees away.

    “Hey Buddy!”

It was a shout, but still a whisper. The voice was friendly. That’s when the bear popped up. It was like one you would see hanging at an impossible carnival game —one of those massive ones, like two and a half feet tall. Short, cheap fur, bright green with a yellow belly. It looked like it had long overstayed its welcome from the dump.

    “I’m Mr. Busy Buster Bear, and I got lost on my way to the circus! Can you help?!”

Again, with the friendly voice, but it was clear it wasn’t coming from the bear. I could make out an arm coming out from behind the tree nearest to Mr. Busy Buster Bear. That’s where the voice was.

    “Uh… no thanks, Bear,” I said, my voice shaking as I edged backward, I could feel my heart starting to race. Though I wasn’t totally sure  why. I didn’t want to be rude, but my body was screaming to get out!
    
    “Well, hey! For your help, I could get you candy, or ice cream, maybe even money!” Mr. Busy Buster Bear yelled, his voice trembling with desperation. I didn’t believe him. I knew this was a man pretending to be a bear. I was starting to feel strange. I knew it was wrong to be rude to an adult, but I also knew this was a stranger danger moment. A red flag was waving in my brain. I was almost annoyed he thought I’d fall for this.
    
    “Come on buddy! What’s your name?” Mr. Busy Buster Bear questioned.
    
    “Thanks, um, no, but I’ll tell my friend you—”
    
    “NO! IT HAS TO BE YOU!” shouted the man. The friendly voice was gone. I could hear the anger.

That’s when the bear fell over, and the shape of the man came out. I only see a shape when I think back to that moment.

I ran. I ran as far and as fast as I could.

The last thing I heard was the voice of Mr. Busy Buster Bear.

    “I’m sorry, buddy! I just want a friend!”

I didn’t look back. I knew this man was dangerous. I knew he would hurt someone. I had to tell an adult. The closest possible adult.

I ran to my friend’s Cameron house. His dad was our baseball coach, and I was determined to get his, or someone’s help.

    “Mr. Carshen! There’s a man in the woods, he’s... he is looking for kids! He might be gone, he might be coming—I don’t know!”

I fell to my knees after that. The rest is a blur—Mrs. Carshen bringing me inside while she called the police, Mr. Carshen grabbing his gun, others joining him to become heroes. To become legends. Hunting a bear in the woods. They found him. They even kept him alive… after a massive beating. They would become local heroes. They thought they might even become men of national legend!

Mr. Carshen became the talk of a nation for about a week. The rest didn’t even make it into the headline.

**""Iowa Wood Snatcher Caught After 2-Year Hunt; Confesses as He's Taken Into Custody: 4 Children Linked to Disappearance""**

**Chapter 3**

His name was Robert Herchuilm. He was born in Norfolk, Nebraska, in 1957. That’s where he first started. He then moved to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Before he made it to Eastern Iowa, he had taken a total of seven lives. He admitted to all of it. They only thought it was four. He was happy to correct the record. They didn’t believe him until he showed them where the bodies were.

As a kid, I didn’t understand how the court system worked. I didn’t understand how any of it worked. I wondered why they didn’t just hang him right there on the spot, take off his head like Maximilian Robespierre would have done before he himself was executed by guillotine. I didn’t realize that even though Robert admitted to what he did, there would still be sentencing. He didn’t plead guilty for a plea deal. He just wanted people to know. I also learned that those put on death row could live for many years afterward.

Sometimes I’d have nightmares where the fragments I remembered of the man would be ripped apart from the blurry shapes I never saw, flesh ripping, being forced into the stuffing of Mr. Busy Buster Bear. An amalgamation of human hair, blood, teeth. Huge yellow rotted teeth mixed with the vibrant yellow of the bear’s stomach, until a creature only H. P. Lovecraft could imagine emerging. Something I could never describe, because I myself could never truly see what it finally became, only parts of flesh and fur. By the end, this thing was the size of a great mountain. After the sounds of violent coughing, screaming, and laughter stopped… trumpets would play, and I would awake.

Robert Herchuilm died in 2010. Not from lethal injection, but in prison. Pneumonia. I assume it would have been beatings if not for the safe space he was put in for having been on death row. I wonder what his last meal was. Hope it tasted better than that last bit of bitter death.

**Chapter 4**

My father died last month.  We hadn’t been to church in years, but they allowed his funeral to be held there. Many in the community and family came to say goodbye. Even his estranged brother. My sister with her husband and son also came down for the day. None of our old church friends were there however. They had avoided our family for years now.

He was the last of the dads from the old neighborhood to pass. I wasn’t very close to my dad compared to others. I wish I was. I always blamed myself for our distance. He never seemed to understand why I couldn’t just get over what happened to me.

He was the least masculine of all the dads, but he was smart, well-spoken, and after a while earned the most, so he was well-respected. He had been in decline for the last three years, he somehow avoided death until now. My mom wasn’t in the best health for someone her age, but she could live on her own with a nurse. My dad made sure she would be all set. He always looked out for us, and made sure we knew he did.

He had plenty of real estate from the last 10 years. He insisted we not sell after he passed, because that would provide for us. In his will, he left a lot to me, but also included stipulations. I would have to quit my exciting career as a technician in North Liberty and start getting into property management. That’ll go over well on Twitter. 

I put in my two weeks a few days after learning all this, excited to actually have money and do something with my life. Turns out, property management sucks. My job is basically just signing checks and having managers double check things with me that I have 0 knowledge on. I hate it. Thanks to nepotism, I don’t even have to go in, and I still get a check. It’s gonna be awkward when I finally put in my two weeks there after I hit my father’s one-year work minimum.

I’m taking the passing well. I knew it was coming. But the memories I have—the time I wish I would have spent telling him how much his words of wisdom actually helped when I was young before we became more distant. Most of the time, in the moment, I’d brush it off with a “yep” or a disinterested smile and nod. He really did care. He really wanted the best for me and my sister. 

She also got a king’s ransom after this. She and my mother were both in tears the entire day of the wake. I tried to talk to them, but I’m not much help.

    “He’s in a better place now,” I tell them for the fifth time. My sister looks up, annoyed, but nods at me with pain in her eyes. I could always tell when she was faking an injury or overreacting to a prank to get our parents on her side. This look was genuine.

My family grew up religious. Both my grandparents on my dad’s side were ministers. My dad even married a Methodist minister. Before my mom had her accident, she worked throughout Iowa. They first met as kids in Red Oak, Iowa before his net worth was actually worth something… the rest is history. Thinking of them together, young and happy makes me smile. I truly believe they were meant to be.

Today is a bit more of a struggle to get through. Everyone has left, and now I just think… he was so young. So is my mother. To pass away at only 57, and for my mother to be stuck in a chair at 59—it’s not fair.

After all the family and community moved on with their lives, it was up to my fathers close family to start cleaning up and taking care of his assets.

I sat in my old room, thinking about how my dad had survived two heart attacks and still managed to look strong. We all knew he was suffering, but he did his best to show strength.  A stroke sent him to the hospital, and he never woke up. All we got was a blink of acknowledgment before he passed. We all prayed for him as he entered the gates of Heaven. As my mom and sister prayed I saw something in his eyes. Fear.

I tried to imagine my dad with angel wings, walking up to Saint Peter, both of them smiling and pointing at each other like the ending of a heartfelt movie, but the look in my fathers dying eyes did not give me any comfort in my imaginary scenario.

After what felt like hours my sister finally walks in.

    “Mom is resting finally. We need to clean out the basement.”

I looked at her for a second.

    “Why?”
    
    “Because we’re both here, and we might as well start getting this place cleared out,” she snapped back at me.
    
    “Oh, so you just want free labor,” I smirked, hoping she’d get the hint—it was a joke, not sarcasm.
    
    “Yes, you caught me. I figured it would be fun for us to go through the stuff down there, since most of it is ours. A fun trip down memory lane.” She nodded toward the basement. “Besides, Mom doesn’t go down there anymore, and I want her to see some of the stuff too. It’ll make her happy.”

My sister was three years older than me, so we had a lot of time together. Growing up, we spent most of that time playing on the church’s playground. Turns out pastors and ministers don’t only work on Sundays.This created a lot of great adventures for my sister and I, from pirates to detectives, we spent so much time on that rundown playground.

I always thought it was funny how we lived in this beautiful home that my parents paid for, when technically we could have lived in a parsonage for free—though the one they had when my sister and I were super young was terrible. My father hated that parsonage and swore he’d get us out. The worst part about that place for him were the bats. You can’t legally harm them in Iowa, and we couldn’t afford to rehome them. So we just dealt with them.

I’m now learning though that a physical “evil” is much less of an issue than a spiritual one.

As we went down to the basement, I felt an uneasy turning in my stomach. I hadn’t felt this way in a long time—well, not out of fear, anyway. It was that anxious kind of feeling where your stomach both drops and jumps up to your throat at the same time.

My sister looked up at me and smiled, saying,  
  

      “Do you remember how scared of this place we were growing up?”

I snapped out of my fear and thought for a second.  
Yes, this basement was terrifying. I don’t why… by all means this was an average basement, but I remember now. We were always so scared to go down here. It was an upper middle class, finished basement, but we would always feel terrible about being down there.

    “We’re just coming down for a second, Mr. Ghost!” my sister yelled, almost laughing as she said it. She kept going,  
    “Remember when we would say that so we didn’t make the spirit mad?”

She had a huge smile on her face. To her, this was a joke—a fun memory of two scared kids.

To me, this was a nightmare. I’m still just a scared little kid. I'm almost 30 years old, and I’m still scared. Still weak.

    “This was like the scariest thing ever…” she trailed off, stopping before we reached the bottom of the stairs.

I could see it—she felt guilt. She remembered how much of a coward I still am thanks to It.  
Mr. Busy Buster Bear.

I jumped in,  
“Well, that and Parker putting his butt cheeks up to the basement window when we were kids! Weirdest neighbor ever!”

We both laughed.

    “Whatever happened to him?” she asked.
    
    “I kid you not—he got into a high-speed chase with the cops, went to jail, got out, and now works at Casey’s as he gets his life together.”

She laughed.

    “Huh! Good for him. He sent me a friend request, and I just never hit accept or deny.” 

I could tell things were still awkward between us. It never felt the same after the summer of 2007. There was a shift.

    “How’s work with the elderly been going?” I asked, trying to clear the awkwardness in the room as we entered the basement.
    
    “It’s fine. The home is nice. It’s the one I’d want to send Mom to someday—but obviously not for a while.”

I stared at her for a second. Did she want to send Mom to a nursing home? Is that why we’re moving this stuff? Does she want the house for her growing family? I mean why wouldn’t she? They deserve something nice. Her husband and son are sweethearts, I wish I could see them more often.  Maybe if they moved closer that could happen.

I started walking toward a box as I thought about mom moving to a retirement home. That part still felt wrong..

    “Well, let’s get started. Just the boxes! I’m not moving the pinball machine or the couch.”

We spent hours going through old stuff. My mom kept everything of ours. It reminded me of how close my sister and I really were growing up. She was my best friend. It also reminded me of just how smart she was. Every spelling test, every paper—anything and everything had a 90 to 100%!

Mine didn’t look so good.

Aside from the history box, all my papers were abysmal.

We went through old trophies, group pictures, and birthday party photos. My sister was my closest friend, and I missed that. Even after the stupid bear, we were close.

We found a paper of old football routes we created and ran at church. We found a card she wrote to me when she went to Missouri for a week with my grandparents for her softball tournament. These were the good memories.

My sister was strong. Brave. She is what I believe my dad wished I could be.

    “How’s the husband and child?” I asked.
    
    “You’re a strange little guy. Hank and *the child* are good,” she said with a smirk. “They’re coming over for the weekend to see Mom.” She stood up. 

“I’m gonna go grab another drink. I’ll be right back—I’ll get you a Dr. Pepper.”

As she left, I saw a massive box in the corner with no label. I went over to open it. It almost sprang open when I cut the tape. A stuffed animal had been shoved inside. I recognized it instantly. The green flat fur. Adrenaline hit me. There was no thinking, only action. I grabbed the box, tore it open, and pulled that stupid bear out. I stared at it. It was him… **Mr. Busy Buster Bear.**

How? Why would they keep this?!

It didn’t matter. This was going to the dump—right now. I dropped it back into the ripped-up box sitting up right. I was going to tape it back up, trap Mr. Busy Buster Bear in his forever tomb, and put him in the trash.

I turned to go upstairs—then I heard it. From the corner, behind  Mr. Busy Buster Bear:

    “Hey, Buddy!”

**Chapter 5**

Growing up religious in the Midwest is nothing special. I remember seeing my mother sit in her chair on Friday, working on her Sunday sermon — and then having to sit through that same sermon twice every Sunday.

I did always enjoy hearing what people needed help with at the start of church. My mother would walk around the pews with her microphone, and people would stand up, saying what they could use prayers for. Many times, it was just an old lady telling you what was new in her life.

I think my mom was happy when she got out of the church. She didn’t enjoy the drama and politics of it all. Leave it to humans to taint the house of God with their own egos and selfishness.

She’d always prefer helping the very old who were on their last leg rather than getting coffee with someone in the congregation who just wanted to talk drama.

To think one’s standing in the church was greater because of X, Y, and Z was strange to see as a child. I was told this behavior was wrong, but there were Scott and Linda, talking about how Sarah should feel ashamed because her daughter was caught flirting with a stoner — and how their son John would *never* do that.

John came out a few years ago on Facebook and had to block his parents and grandparents because they kept leaving bible quotes under his posts.

Church was strange. One day a guy named Nicholas showed up and became a regular. He seemed normal at first. Some said he was off, but had a good heart. He’d sit a few pews back and appeared to be focused on what was being said. He became infatuated with one of the ladies there named Sarah.

As a kid, it made sense to me. They were both old, twenty-something, they both loved God. Why not?

Well, apparently, she didn’t feel the same way. Nicholas started to spiral. He’d write weird things outside the church on the sidewalk with chalk. It wasn’t anything bad, just symbols and gibberish.

He started asking for the mic at the start of each sermon, and he’d ask us to pray for Sarah. He claimed she was a druggie and that she was in love with her dealer. He said he saw them kiss outside her apartment. All this while she was sitting right there in the church with her parents.

After the restraining order, he’d claim Christians didn’t care about him anymore.

Church isn’t strange. People are. I was no exception. I did plenty of strange things growing up. I remember when I was six, I asked my mom:

    “Are we basically related and closer to God because you are a minister and talk to Him?”

She laughed, and I genuinely can’t remember her answer. I don’t know if she does either. It was an egotistical question. A want to be closer to God than others. I don’t want to ask if she remembers.

She retired very young. She retired in 2007. After my encounter with the bear. I thought they all hated us because of me, but they distrusted my family before 2007.

 I still wonder what truly caused the turn in what was once a welcoming congregation. Church politics?

**Chapter 6**

I’ve learned that giving a name to something gives it power. I think I’ve given that bear enough names to make him the King of France.

My name is Josiah Kellerman. I am a coward, but I wasn’t always this way. It wasn’t the bear. It can’t be the bear. I was messed up before this, but normal before that—a paradox of stupidity and self-pity. God, what is my purpose? Who am I? I thought I’d figure that out in my mid-twenties. That, or find out I have schizophrenia. The jury still seems to be out on this one.

My name isn’t worth much. I was written about once.

*‘Josiah, 11, was approached by Herchuilm before he ran off to alert Carshen. Carshen then, along with others, detained Herchuilm until authorities arrived.’*

My sister’s name has power. She has been written about a lot. As a kid, she was an All-State athlete. My father also had countless headlines, though those were a bit less flattering.

*‘Jacob Kellerman Joins New Property Management Team Following Building Condemnation’*

My mother is very similar to me, never seeking much, but plenty would come her way. Rebekah.

I wonder if my nephew Matthew will become a great name one day. I hope I can give him any strength he needs. I doubt there is a child in my future. My past—my history—I have a hard time letting it go. As one might notice, I spiral easily. Non-sequiturs, jumping from one point to another with little rhyme or reason, don’t fare well in an argument. I used to argue a lot with past girlfriends. I learned early on that I was, in fact, the problem.

I wish this self-pity could turn into self-reflection and realizations. I’d like to become a better man, a leader of a household. But for now, I am a supporter. I will do better for my family: my sister Abigail, her husband Hank, Matthew, and my mother *Rebekah*. I can be there for them. I laugh telling myself that. I’m barely even a supporter…

They don’t know it yet, but I’m sure there is an evil surrounding us. Not a physical one, but a spiritual one. I just don’t understand it. We are playing a dangerous game. I have to do something, but the fear I feel can’t be explained. The pit of my stomach is screaming for this to stop, but it won’t until someone does something!

**Chapter 7**

I thought my mother and sister would understand. Of all people, they should have. They speak of angels with conviction, pray against darkness, claim to believe in evil. So why, when I told them what I’d seen, what I *felt*, did they look at me like I was insane? If you believe in angels, you have to believe in demons. Don’t you?

    “Why on earth would we keep that bear?” my mother questioned.
    
    “Dude, they would have put that in evidence. Mom and Dad wouldn’t have had any chance to keep it!” my sister pointed out. I paused for a second, my hyperventilating slowing down. She was right. Had I made it up? Maybe I was going crazy. Maybe that schizophrenia was finally kicking in. 

I pleaded with my sister.

“I saw Mr. Busy Buster Bear down there. Please, someone just come look!” There was a sadness in her eyes… pity. It was no secret that I never really got over the whole ""almost getting murdered or worse"" thing, and then getting the murderer sentenced to death. Technically, I was a hero, but it was hard for me, and for others, to see it that way.

    “I’m not crazy. This isn’t like when I was 17. There is something there, Abby! Please.” I was almost crying at this point. I could feel my tear ducts filling, the ever-so-slight pain and burning of holding them back. 

I looked at her, waiting for something, anything. I wondered if she felt the pressure of being the favorite. Does she now feel the same pressure of being the ""normal"" one, too? I hope she doesn’t resent me. If there isn’t anything down there, I’m for sure getting sent somewhere. I had never broken down or said anything “crazy” enough to be *forced* into a clinic, but screaming about Mr. Busy Buster Bear—a name I’ve never said out loud in my life, except to the police during a very understanding questioning in 2007, may just convince them I’m truly deranged.

    I was shaking. I was creating a word salad. I was resorting to what I’d do during arguments.""Look, cards on the table: I’m not crazy, but if that bear isn’t down there, I know you’ll both want me out of your life. I’m too messed up! But I swear, not only is it down there, but it talked to me!” 

    “This isn’t some trauma or overreaction. This is real. There’s a haunted bear downstairs! Please don’t hate me. I…” Abby finally stepped in. 

     She looked at my mother, who was also on the verge of crying. She agreed with Abby. I tried my best to be stable.“We never want you out of our lives.”

    “Please, Abby.”

We lived in a big house growing up, so it was a bit of a walk to the basement stairs from the living room. When we got to the stairs, I hesitated. The stairs were strange, not like a normal house. They went from the basement, to the main floor, and then up to the upstairs. No doors—just a shit ton of stairs.

I grabbed my sister's arm.

    “I swear I’m not crazy. I don’t need mental help...”
    
    “Just spiritual,” Abby interrupted. I looked at her, confused.
    
    “For the demon, dude,” she said, pointing to the basement. We started to walk down. She led, and I followed. I hadn’t felt a fear like this in my adult life. I usually avoided stress to the best of my ability. But now, I felt like a kid again.

One time, when we were kids, I joined the football team and could bring the football pads home.I was 10 at the time. I was so excited to be on a team. I put them on and led us downstairs, screaming that we didn’t care who was down there. We weren’t scared of them! I wasn’t afraid!

That night, I had the worst nightmare of my life. Something was there. Put me in my place real quick.

As we got closer to the basement, she asked me why I turned the lights off. I didn’t. She hesitated, then walked down and looked over the corner where the torn-up box was.

    “What the hell?!”									

**Chapter 8**

Twenty years ago I had a dream that started like any other… at least, any I can remember from when I was ten. I was just wandering through an old candy store with a group of faceless kids, none of whom I recognized. We snagged some candy, and then it turned into us having to travel to space for a future mission. We were all excited, but the tests were hard for me to understand. I couldn’t read; I couldn’t understand what the issues were that I needed to solve. Any physical task I’d fail, while the other seven kids had no issues. It was literally me trying to throw a punch in a dream. It felt like I was stuck in water.

That’s when the kids left. I was in this weird, clean room, alone. I instantly became aware I was dreaming. This was a strange feeling— as a kid, I had never had this happen before. I looked down. I was in my football pads again. I felt so brave running into the basement with my sister earlier that day, a heroic 10-year-old kid ready to face the unseen evil in the basement. Now I was once again a frightened child.

As I looked around in the dream, I realized that in real life I couldn’t move. This was the first and only time I had ever experienced sleep paralysis. I was both awake and asleep, I was in the dream while also laying in bed.

That’s when the figure appeared. It didn’t look like anything else in the room. It also had no features, just a silhouette of pure black, with a light shining behind it. The dream still had that usual fuzzy feeling, but the figure didn’t. It felt real. Tangible. Both in the dream and in my room, standing over my motionless body in the real world.

I tried to scream, but all that came out was a string of half-formed, broken sounds, gibberish.

Then the figure reached out as if to touch my forehead. I could feel the heat from the figure, but I myself felt so cold. 

The faceless children returned, and they began laughing at me. The laughs turned to screams, the screams became so loud that my body shook. My brain tried to find an escape as the screams somehow grew louder. Find something else to take over my thoughts.

The 1883 volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia is considered the loudest sound in recorded history, estimated at around 310 decibels being heard 3000 miles away.

The screams stopped and the children were gone. The figure left me with one final statement.

    “You aren’t afraid of me?”

Like I said. Put me in my place real quick.

**Chapter 9**

In 63 BC, fresh from defeating Mithridates, Pompey the Great turned his sights on Jerusalem, a divided city at the time… soon to feel the weight of Rome’s ambition.

As a child, I grew up reading parts of the Bible. I didn’t find much interest in it until I discovered its relevance in scary stories online. Online horror stories were the one thing I enjoyed. Somehow, reading scary things felt less intense than seeing them.

As a teen I searched for stories online through different forms, this led to a strange thread of history and religion from “Mother Horse Eyes” on Reddit, I was confused by it until a story came from it that I recognized: the story of Pompey the Great.

When Pompey arrived in Jerusalem, he surveyed the city. There was a temple in that city, one where someone could speak to and see God Himself, or a god of some sort. Only one priest was allowed to do this.

I never thought much about this aspect of Jerusalem until the thought was put in my head: if God, or an angel, was there, what would it look like? Would it be beautiful, or terrifying? Four-faced creatures, wheels within wheels, full of eyes. Fire and lightning. It’s impossible geometry—something that breaks the brain.

He entered the Holy of Holies… the most sacred part of the Temple, where only the High Priest was allowed to enter once a year. The Holy of Holies was meant to be the dwelling place of God’s presence—the *Shekinah*. It was empty when Pompey entered. Is coming face to face with something we don’t understand a blessing?

If that god was actually a demon, what would an interaction with it turn into? Maybe Exodus 33:20. No one could look upon Him and live. 

Have I now looked upon something I should not have? Who in this family welcomed this thing into our home? I always believed that a demon or evil must be summoned. Have I become the target of this thing for the last 20 years without even realizing it? I am no conquer, but I have walked into a temple of the unholy. 

**Chapter 10**

    “Who put that bear there?” My sister sounded tense. Three emotions pushed through: confusion, fear, and anger.

I couldn’t believe it. Still in the corner, that stupid bear was just sitting there. I wasn’t crazy. It was there… for me *and* my much more normal sister to see. I tried to answer her, but she just kept going.

    “Is this a joke?”  
    “Where did you get this?”  
    “Who had this, Josiah?!”

Before I could answer any of her rushed questions, she stormed over to grab Mr. Busy Buster Bear. She only made it three steps before he introduced himself.

    “Hi Abby! I’m Mr. Busy Buster Bear! Did you know your dad is here, burning in Hell?”
    
    “W...what?” She looked back at me.
    
    “Is this… a joke? Josiah, please! I… I…”

This time, the voice was darker—happy to finally have a new victim. The fake sheen of a kind voice was gone. It had fully revealed itself.

    “Abby... you stupid girl. You could never understand what’s happening.”  
    The bear’s bright colors began to fade as a shadow from the corner of the room consumed the entire wall, like a large hand clasping around a bug before crushing it.
    
    “Josiah! How are you doing this?! Please stop-”
    
    “Don’t interrupt me you fucking whore! I will destroy you and that horrific family you’ve made!” The venomous statement filled the room before Mr. Busy Buster Bear continued in a more whimsical tone. 

    “Josiah, thank you for bringing her to me, thank you for showing me the deal can still be finished even without you…” I was frozen with shock and tried to speak.
    “What? I don’t understand.”
    “YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU DO!”

We dropped to our knees covering our ears. The voice was booming as a horrific and mocking laugh erupted through the walls.. Like a command from god. 

It then all stopped. Like my dream so many years ago. A volcanic eruption of noise and then nothing. Had it even happened? Yes I know it did, and now my sister would too. I looked over to her as she began to stand. Our eyes locked and she began to speak.

    “I will NOT fall into your delusions. I don’t know what that was. I don’t know how you got the bear. But I’m getting rid of it.”
    
    “Wait, Abby, that was real! How the hell—”  
    She turned around, grabbing me as I ran up to her.
    
    “No. We are stressed. We are sad. You are sick in the head, and I— *for a moment* —fell into your fucked-up brain! Leave me alone, Josiah.”

After all that… Abby somehow thinks I’m crazier than ever before. She saw it, she heard it… Yet I am the crazy one.

The bear spoke to me *again*. It spoke to us. It knows things about my family… my father. He was not greeting Peter at the gates of Heaven. He was rotting in Hell. Why?",1,1760976226.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

They keep blaming inflation but let’s be real it’s hard to buy that excuse when we look at their record profits (billions..👀 Tesco)

Here’s a few tips to help you save 💷:

1.	⁠Save between 3-20% off your weekly shop by using Everup and/or JamDoughnut. These apps let you buy a gift card for supermarkets/ other stores and reward you with cashback. These apps can also be used to purchase Apple, Spotify… Gift cards to pay for your subscriptions saving you 5-10% off your monthly bill.

2.	⁠Airtime rewards is an app that allows you to link your card and will automatically save you cashback at retailers and supermarkets which can be used to pay off your phone bill at the end of the month. This app is promoted by a few UK mobile networks so it’s a trusted app and the data it collects on your spending is likely already being sold by your bank so why not profit of it too :) (10% off TK Maxx, 6% off Boots…)

3.	⁠Two tier pricing is everywhere forcing people to sign up to loyalty schemes…I am sharing uk store membership cards for those who want the best price but don't want to handover their data (phone number, address..) 📊 we should be able to shop without having to worry about our data being sold, leaked or misused (👀 co-op) If you want convenient access to all the membership / ‘loyalty’ cards, you can use the linktree to download them to your phones mobile wallet. linktr.ee/shopperprivacy

4.	⁠If you’re a coffee addict like me it’s worth investing in a taste card, it saves me 25% off at Caffè Nero and Black Sheep. The tastecard are almost always on offer (free for a year or 50% off) so it’s definitely worth checking out.

**Quick answer:** Anchor your weekends to Denton’s biggest October events—Arts & Jazz, 31 Days of Denton Halloween, and Day of the Dead—and build in short, targeted neighborhood tours before or after. You’ll experience the city’s culture, commute patterns, and amenities the way locals do while narrowing your home search with confidence.

# Denton’s new claim to fame

It’s official: the **Texas Legislature designated Denton the Halloween Capital of Texas for a 10-year period through 2035**, spotlighting the city’s month-long celebration that turns the Downtown Square and surrounding venues into a fall showcase. Expect installations, markets, themed pop-ups, live music, and a packed event calendar all October. [Texas Legislature Online+1](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/html/HC00086F.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# The “Big Three” weekends to plan around

# 1) Denton Arts & Jazz Festival (Oct 3–5, 2025)

Held at **Quakertown Park**, Arts & Jazz kicks off the month with six outdoor stages, art, food, and nationally known performers. If you’re touring nearby neighborhoods, plan showings in the morning and walk the festival in the afternoon to get a true feel for Denton’s creative pulse. [Denton Arts & Jazz Fest+1](https://dentonjazzfest.com/events/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 2) 31 Days of Denton Halloween (All October)

From ghostly history to live music and nightly happenings, the **official Denton Halloween site** and city promotions update the schedule weekly. Look for new features (like the Downtown maze and kickoff events) and recurring favorites across the month—perfect for pairing with a few strategic home tours. [dentonhalloween.com+1](https://www.dentonhalloween.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# 3) Denton Day of the Dead Festival (Oct 24–26, 2025)

Culture, parades, and market energy meet fall flavor for one of Denton’s most photogenic weekends. If you’re comparing downtown-adjacent homes, this is the weekend to test parking, walkability, and access to your favorite cafés and restaurants. [Denton's Day of the Dead Festival](https://dentondayofthedeadfestival.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

>

# Build your “Events + Showings” mini-itinerary

Here’s how I help buyers and movers get the most from a single October weekend:

1. **Pick the anchor event** (Arts & Jazz or a marquee Halloween weekend).
2. **Cluster 3–5 homes** within 10–15 minutes of that venue.
3. **Block 90 minutes** before the event for drive-bys + one interior tour.
4. **Walk the event** to feel the neighborhood atmosphere.
5. **Return after dark** (if applicable) to gauge nightlife and noise.
6. **Add a Sunday morning coffee run** to check your real-world commute routes.

# Neighborhood notes to pair with your plans

* **Close to the Square:** Historic charm, independent shops, and quick event access. Great if you want walkable proximity to October happenings.
* **Around Quakertown Park:** Convenient for large festivals with straightforward routes in and out; add this to your drive-by list during Arts & Jazz. [Denton Arts & Jazz Fest](https://dentonjazzfest.com/events/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Parks & trails access:** Nature more your thing? Flag listings near **Clear Creek Natural Heritage Center** (miles of trails, wetlands, and wildlife viewing) or **South Lakes Park** (lakes, piers, courts, trails). These are year-round lifestyle boosters that still keep you close to October action. [cityofdenton.com+1](https://www.cityofdenton.com/222/Clear-Creek?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Sample weekend plans (copy/paste + adjust)

**Weekend A (Arts & Jazz Kickoff):**

* **Fri:** Early dinner downtown → Festival opener → 2 neighborhood drive-bys on the way home.
* **Sat:** 9:30 a.m. showings near Quakertown Park → Festival stages + art market → late dessert on the Square.
* **Sun:** Coffee + quick loop through a second neighborhood set → submit questions/offer strategy.

**Weekend B (Day of the Dead):**

* **Fri:** Evening market + parade preview → check nighttime street ambience.
* **Sat:** 10:00 a.m. showings within 1–2 miles of the Square → festival afternoon → note parking/traffic patterns.
* **Sun:** Brunch downtown → final drive-bys of top 2 homes → next steps meeting.

# Practical planning tips

* **Parking & timing:** On big weekends, arrive 30 minutes early for downtown parking zones and rideshare pickups.
* **Reservations:** Secure dinner spots for Saturday prime time; events like Arts & Jazz pull regional crowds. [Denton Arts & Jazz Fest](https://dentonjazzfest.com/events/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* **Shoes & layers:** You’ll be on your feet—pack water, sunscreen, and a light layer for evening temps.
* **Photos & notes:** Create a shared album for homes/neighborhoods so you can compare curb appeal and block feel later.
* **Check the official calendars** the week of your visit—new events are added all month. [dentonhalloween.com](https://www.dentonhalloween.com/events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Yearly staples beyond October (for future planning)

If you’re thinking longer-term, pencil in **North Texas Fair & Rodeo (Aug 15–24, 2025)** as a warm-weather counterpart to October’s festivities. It’s a great time to test summer traffic and venue access while exploring north-side neighborhoods. [ntfair.com+1](https://ntfair.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# What this means for your home search

October gives you a rare, real-time snapshot of Denton’s lifestyle—how streets feel during events, which routes you’ll actually use, and which neighborhoods match your rhythm. That context is invaluable when choosing a home you’ll love year-round.

# Final takeaway

Denton in October is an experience: festivals, live music, cultural celebrations, and a fully activated Downtown Square. With a smart plan, you can soak up the city **and** make serious progress on your next-home search—without sacrificing any of the fun.

So I've gone through a few posts on different espresso machine recommendations and wanted to get your guys thoughts on taking the plunge for a La Marzocco Mini. 

In terms of background- I've always enjoyed brewing filter at home and have a pretty good coffee shop down the road for espresso drinks. However, I really enjoy the idea of being able to make these at home for me and my family with my own setup (especially when my local place is closed and I fancy a flat white at 6pm haha). 

In terms of requirements: I tend to enjoy lighter roasts (anything by Dak, Scenery etc.) and would be making a handful of drinks a day. From everything I've read, seems La Marzocco is: a) Expensive b) You're paying for the name. However, they are one of the best for a reason (consistently good) and I like the idea of buying a machine that will most likely out last me haha. 

I looked at the Micra but the cup clearance looks like a massive design flaw to me.

I anticipate the Mini is slightly overkill based on my requirements and it is a lot price wise for a coffee machine etc etc. 

Would be open to other machine suggestions for sure- just so I can make the most informed decision. In terms of grinder- I'd be looking to get a DF64 Gen 2.

After some research, youtube recommended me this video. The cleaning results of the (top rated) vacuums was really underwhelming. I don't care much about the wet carpet, but it looked like mopping runs made the floor dirtier. Leaving water droplets and water streaks. Vacuuming also seemed less than stellar.  
My biggest concern is that they took some of the top rated vacuums from one of these comparison sites (vacuumwars). Can these sites be trusted? The tests seems a tad weird. How often do people spill ketchup or coffee and then wait for it dry before cleaning?

My use case was to run the robot daily, vacuum all the excess hair, mop the tiles, preferably have the robo clean and dry itself. Really minimize my work, while maximizing cleanliness. Optionally: integrate with HomeAssistant.

1obm17s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1obm17s/scott_rao_method_explained_and_refined/,Scott Rao method - explained and refined,"...or how to stop *overthinking* pourover

Hello folks!

Maybe you know the feeling of trying a hyped method like Hoffmann, Tetsu Kasuya (4/6), Perger, Hedrick, Howell or whatever they are called. You might get a nice cup of coffee but when you brew next morning it´s bad. Overextracted perhaps, maybe underextracted - no matter what, it´s not good this time. And then you start thinking; was it the temperature? The grind setting? Or the speed you poured the water?

...and then you start *overthinking*... tuning the different variables and maybe, only maybe, get back on track.

Or you may be new to pourover, and can´t really nail it - as most of us experienced brewers struggled with in the beginning.

The Rao method may be a gamechanger!

I have recently been experimenting with the method, or to be precise; the method that he introduced back in 2017 and refined in an updated version in 2020. And I got some results that i´d like to share.

The method gave me *excellent* coffee. So did some other hyped methods (but not all - looking at you Tetsu Kasuya! What is wrong with you? Do you really like ""brown water""?).

The big difference is *consistency.* Every single cup I brew is good. There are no more days with bad cups in the morning anymore! Even with the notoriosly unstable (but still excellent v60) I get good results *every* time. Honestly, if you cough, sneeze, burp or fart during the brewing proces with a v60 you will ruin your coffee. With the Rao method the shockwave going through your body if you thought you farted, *but really didn´t,* won´t destroy your coffee. It is that consistent.

The reason for this is that most parameters is eliminated. It is only the grind setting you have to adjust. Even the speed at wich you pour has a very large margin, making it excellent for beginners as well as those who are experienced.

So what is it the Rao method? Well it breaks with many of the dogmas of modern pourover methods. It is fine grinded beans (very fine) combined with lots of agitation and no temperature control - it is off the boil! Pretty much like dear old granma did it.

This ensures maximum extraction with very little risk of your coffee being overextracted. It is often so intense that you only need a ratio of 1/16-1/18 beans to water.

Most methods require, besides a certain grind setting, slow and very precise pouring and also temperatures that fits exactly the kind of bean you are using. The Rao method on the other hand eliminates these variables. You only need to adjust grind setting depending of the beans you are using.

The reason I am writing this post is that I think the method deserves more attention. Rao is an expert to brewing and roasting coffee, but his videos from that time, when he introduced the method, is´nt very good (forgive me mr Rao if you ever read this). If you try to replicate the videos step by step, your coffee won´t be good. Another post here in Reddit tried that once, and I did´nt find it very helpful.

By experienting and also looking at the Q/A section on Raos website (yes it is that old!), I have done the work for you. I have also watched both videos end extracted the relevant info (the updated video is close to similar with the old, it is just a matter of two pors instead of one - or actually 1 and half pour).

**Time for the recipe:**

**You will need a gooseneck kettle (any will do, you don´t need temperature control), a dripper (any will do - I tested on v60, Kalita wave and Kalita wave Tsubame - and they all worked), a coffee scale and most importantly a decent grinder. The grinder is really the only thing you have to spend some bucks on. It can´t be to good but it certanly can be to lousy. If your budget is tight, then go for a handgrinder. You get a lot for the money usually.**

**Grind setting is** ***fine*** **and I mean FINE!, much finer than any other method I know (1)**

**-The method works best with 18-22 grams of coffe, but you can go down to 15grams. Best results for me was between 18 grams to 300ml of water and 22 grams coffee to 360 ml of water. For small brews below 18 grams of coffee you might want to just use one pour instead of two.**

**Sometimes I use slightly less beens with light roasts, as the taste can be really intense with this high extraction method. Rao recommends a ratio of 1/16-1/18 beans to water in grams**

**-Use water of the boil (2)**

**-Start by blooming the coffee for 45 sekunds. Use 3 times the weight of the coffee (for example 60 grams of water for 20 grams of coffee). Pour the water fast and then swirl the dripper aggressively (or stir with a spoon carefully)**

**-Pour at least half of the remaining water at high speed (9-15 ml/second - more about speed below). Keep your kettle high above the slurry to maximize agitation - just before you hear a splattering noise (that ruins the agitation). Pour in circles (3)**

**-Wait a little until some of the water has drawn down. No more than halfway as it will lower the temperature in the slurry. I usually wait about 20-30 seconds +/- (4)**

**-Pour the remaining water at the same speed as before**

**-Swirl you dripper gently. This ensures a flat coffee bed for even extraction**

**-Do not focus on drawdown time. If the coffee tastes good - the time was perfect.**

The notes:

1. For a v60 I am at about 17-18 clicks on a Comandante (510-540 microns for reference). For a Kalita wave it is a little coarser. You can find grind charts online for most grinders). This may be different depending on the quality of your grinder. Start a little high and then go one step down at a time, until you get some astringensy - then backup one or two steps, and you will be there. Light roast tends to need a little finer grind than medium. You will need to experiment at little at first depending on you dripper
2. I find no difference between letting the kettle boil throughout the whole proces or not. There will be a slight decline in extraction but it is insignificant.
3. Pour a little more than half of the remaining water in the first pour. For example up to 230 grams (total weight including bloom) if I brew with 360g water in total. We want to keep the slurry as hot as possible and it will cool down more with less water in the first pour.
4. Actually the same as (3). To keep the temperature high. The longer you wait the more extraction but also lower temperature - wich the gives lower extraction. 1/3 down is fine. This was a one pour method first, remember? But feel free to experiment :)

About the speed of pouring, and this is important: I have tested with an Fellow EKG with a very narrow spout, and a Hario Boeno stovetop with a very wide spout. My conclusion was, that the EKG worked best at about 10ml/s but with a optimal margin og 9-11 ml/s. The Bueno was better at about 12-13 ml/s with a margin of 11-14. However - if I loose consentration for a brief moment, it really does not matter if I hit 8 or 12 ml/s with the EKG. Just correct back to an average of 10 and it will be fine. Same goes with the Bueno. These margins are HUGE. No other method allows you to be so unprecise, so even dear old granny with her shaky hands can do this

The difference between kettles is probably because the same amount of water passing through af narrow exit will hit the slurry harder - imagine a garden hose where you press the tip. Same amount of water per second, but it hits the wall harder. So to get the perfect agitation in the slurry you must experiment a bit. My advise will be to chose a speed, fx 12ml/s (just an example - do what you want) then dial in the grind setting.

They keep blaming inflation but let’s be real it’s hard to buy that excuse when we look at their record profits (billions..👀 Tesco)

Here’s a few tips to help you save 💷:

1. Save between 3-20% off your weekly shop by using Everup and/or JamDoughnut. These apps let you buy a gift card for supermarkets/ other stores and reward you with cashback. These apps can also be used to purchase Apple, Spotify… Gift cards to pay for your subscriptions saving you 5-10% off your monthly bill.

2. Airtime rewards is an app that allows you to link your card and will automatically save you cashback at retailers and supermarkets which can be used to pay off your phone bill at the end of the month. This app is promoted by a few UK mobile networks so it’s a trusted app and the data it collects on your spending is likely already being sold by your bank so why not profit of it too :) (10% off TK Maxx, 6% off Boots…)  

3. If you’re a coffee addict like me it’s worth investing in a taste card, it saves me 25% off at Caffè Nero and Black Sheep. The tastecard are almost always on offer (free for a year or 50% off) so it’s definitely worth checking out. 

4. Two tier pricing is everywhere forcing people to sign up to loyalty schemes…I am sharing uk store membership cards for those who want the best price but don't want to handover their data (phone number, address..) 📊 we should be able to shop without having to worry about our data being sold, leaked or misused (👀 co-op) If you want convenient access to all the membership / ‘loyalty’ cards, you can use the linktree to download them to your phones mobile wallet. linktr.ee/shopperprivacy

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Internacional vs. Bahia: A Clash of Desperation and Momentum**  
*Where the Odds Are as Boring as a Referee’s Post-Match Interview*

---

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?**  
Let’s crunch the numbers like a striker crumbles a defender’s hopes. The odds paint Bahia as the favorite, with prices hovering around **-120 to -150** (implied probability: **52-55%**), while Internacional sits at **+350 to +400** (24-27%). The draw? A tidy 30% chance, or roughly the odds your local barista remembers your coffee order.

Key stats:

* **Internacional** has scored 2+ goals in 4 of their last 5 matches, including a *very* satisfying 2-0 takedown of Sport (who are currently 20th, 14 points adrift of safety). Striker Dílson Borré just snapped a *two-month* goal drought—like a man finally finding his car keys after a three-hour search.
* **Bahia**, meanwhile, have lost 2 of their last 3 games, including a 2-1 drubbing by Vitória. Their defense? Porous enough to make a sieve blush.

The totals market favors the **Under 2.5 goals** (-120 to -150), suggesting this could be as explosive as a wet firework. Both teams’ defenses have been… *relentless* in recent weeks.

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Other Plot Twists**  
**Internacional**: Fresh off their victory, they’re riding a wave of momentum. Goalkeeper Ivan is their unsung hero, making saves so clutch they’d make a Hollywood montage. Borré’s goal? A psychological lifeline for the team—imagine breaking a two-month goal drought like you’ve just unlocked a secret level in FIFA. No major injuries reported, though their bench players are probably still recovering from the emotional trauma of that

1oblmdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1oblmdh/my_story_i_guess/,My story i guess?,"I feel like discussing whats my schizophrenia is and my story. And hopefully give some people insight or a new perspective from my experiences ect. 

Well to start off with my schizophrenia is actually a genetic trate, which i would assume that came from my dads side of my family. I got my schizophrenia from marihuana/weed. One of those genes are called AKT1, and the other one is called COMT. Idk which one I've got all I know is, i got it from one of them. But I didn't got it instantly though, at the time when I was 14 when I first started smoking weed nothing really happened but over the years I started to get more paranoid but I didn't really thought nothing of it at all, being a young teenager like anyone else would say, ""I smoke weed, to calm my nerves down"" or at least something along those lines. It gets gradually worse and worse over the coming years until at one night when I was hitting a joint it all came crashing down. 

I was at my sisters house, looking after the pets when she was out, I was 19 at the time, and I heard yelling next door. Buried in mind my sister's walls were very thin and I heard her neighbours talking about me, being very high and very intoxicated, my paranoia just hits the roof, and keep hearing their neighbours or more specifically the husband next door ""talking shit about me"" and he wanted to kill me and was trying to break down the door to get me as well, I actually got really scared so I grabbed a knife and just waited in the corner, I called my mum and decided to go home, it was late at night (it was 1AM in the morning at the time) all the way to my home i felt like so many people were watching me, but assuming it was just the weed and having a very bad trip, I thought nothing of it and just kept going if it was like normal. But in the morning after that ""event"" i texted my sister of what happened from last night, so my brother in law to check their neighbours if anything actually happened. And guess what their neighbours told them nothing actually happened from that night when I was there. I dont know how to really explain it to my sister but I genuinely felt them yelling about me and I heard footsteps at the front door. It felt so real to me, that i was genuinely convinced that the husband of my sister's neighbours were trying to kill me. I sounded crazy to my sister, and she just couldn't wrap her head around what I was really trying to say. 

Obviously at the time, I didn't thought I have schizophrenia or anything or simply hearing voices, but my paranoia stuck with me, and I never really felt the same as before. As the days go by after that ""event"" I started to hear voices, and my paranoia just gotten worse overall. I didn't know what was happening to me, I was really lost and started to lose ny own mind too. 

I think what a lot of people dont tend to understand what is paranoia + schizophrenia is or overall any mental health issues. That your mental health is how you actually react to that said symptom or whatever it may be, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, so on so on. And for me paranoia is not simply being scared, its more, im willing to get rid of this feeling in any shape or form possible, which truthfully it nearly caused my own life taken away multiple times  and i also did a lot of self harm too, and also especially endangering other people as well. Obviously i didn't taken my own life or harm other people (thank God) and despite the simple answer I've gave, its way more complicated to really explain (plus if I did explain quite literally everything, we'll be here all day) im sure a lot of people within this community can understand where im coming from and thank you, but for someone who has a friend or a family member who has paranoia with schizophrenia, i know that said people can be very delicate to deal and handle with, because anything could happen, just depending on how they react to it and how bad it is, and for that i am sorry. 

At the hight of my own paranoia + schizophrenia which lasted just under a whole year, which I call it my ""delusional phase"". Hearing voices 24/7 (even typing this as I text) they will comment about on everything and degrade me constantly or just talk shit about me as i feel humiliated, but the worst part is that, it was my own family / close friends were the loudest, and having paranoia as well, I really started not to trust anyone, even random people. It was so fucking bad I genuinely thought my own parents were celling me to the black market so they could make some easy money, and i hear them constantly arguing at night about me just really degraded me as a whole. Even a simple phone call, i thought they only did it for bad reason besides to check on me, in my own mind I always think the very very very worse in any given moment. 

This really effected me a lot, too much actually, the point where I literally lost sleep for a good 2 weeks or so, I was literally seeing things because the lack of sleep, but I also think the schizophrenia could also enhance the delusions I could see constantly with the lack of sleep. I just didn't lose sleep either, I was really going crazy as well, I dont know what was going on, and as it gotten worse the voices/ my closest family is telling me to go cut myself, so I did, I dont want to go in keen detail for other people's sake, but I ended up in the hospital with a huge pile of blood everywhere on me, especially on my arms, I still didn't trust anyone, even the doctors. I just stared blankly all throughout. If my brother at the time didn't stepped into the kitchen when I did harmed myself, I don't  think I would even be here typing this on reddit of all places. Obviously my whole family was worried and this was a turning point of true realisation of my situation. 

Buried in mind, I was cooped in my room dealing with these voices constantly, I didn't felt like eating or doing anything really, besides smoking cigarettes and drink coffee to lower the tone down, and hearing your own family members saying ""go kill yourself"" and all other sorts of things constantly 24/7 of course I would, resulted the way it did happen. Another thing I realised now, i also had multiple personality disorder (which it had been proven on my own medical records among other things as well) tbf I am not surprised. 

At the hight of my ""delusional phase"" I just started to shift into a whole other person/people for a couple minutes, I know now this is more a massive coping mechanism to give myself some air and just to feel free again from everything. But when I do like switch, it happens so naturally I don't even realise it until somebody interrupts me, to be honest, I dont like anyone seeing me in this type of state, because it feels like somebody ruins my flow and I tend to do it privately and thats when it tends to happen anyways, its like having a conversation with yourself but also talking to someone you know as well. You become the talker and the listener at the same time. But I will say this, it never really harmed me or other people for that matter so I ain't that particularly bothered by it from my own experience. Like I said, for me its a massive coping mechanism, that is all. 

When I finally started to get my head back together and some good sleep for once, I decided to do some research on, what the actual fuck is going on with me, obviously I've learned that I had a genetic trait that was activated from the chemicals of weed/THC which it all started from that night for me at my sisters house. And I cannot explain how much weight that went off my own shoulders when I started to learn more about schizophrenia and paranoia among other things as well, because to me, it was so hard to convince myself whatever I was hearing was not real. I did quite a fair share of research on how everything worked, especially with my condition and overall, it really helped me a lot to be honest. I was on youtube if there's any other way to calm the voices down within my own head or how other people tends to manage their own problems.The thing is with schizophrenia as a whole + paranoia, it is just a bunch of unbalanced chemicals within your own brain, thats literally what it is, from a science point of view. So if you could some how rebalance everything, theoretically your schizophrenia may not be ""fixed"" but it will be a whole lot more manageable to deal with and finally have a sense within yourself on reality. 

So as I was doing research, if you are very caffeinated person for a while now like the point where you could actually go sleep after drinking a whole cup of coffee and still be fine, if you cut off the caffeine within your body for 6 hours before you go sleep, your brain realised this and seeing the normal pattern with the caffeine, your brain tries to sort its self out but cant so your brain decided to reset everything, and in response it will rebalanced your brain chemicals, it may not necessarily ""Fix"" schizophrenia or the one I have or others, but I can tell you this right now it helped a lot, my voices only can be heard in the most quiet moments. I dont know it will help for everyone, but it doesn't hurt to try i guess, hence why im telling you this. 

I am doing actually okay now before anyone ask like seriously and just a thought to share for others if needed.

1oblk16,https://i.redd.it/c04m31hsaawf1,Review #29 - Horse Solider 10 Year Barrel Select - Spec’s Pick,"Howdy folks. Another review coming in, with this one being from a brand i’ve never tried before: Horse Soldier.

For the uninitiated, Horse Soldier is a brand founded by American veterans, commemorating the Green Berets that were deployed to the Middle East shortly after 9/11. The brand has a great story behind it, but the actual whiskey itself that Horse Solider has put out under their own label has received mixed reviews over the years. Despite this, the future of the brand looks bright, as they have now purchased and are operating their own distillery in Kentucky. 

While it’s great that they are now doing their own distilling, we as whiskey consumers all recognize that it will be quite some time before their whiskey is aged long enough. Until then, they are still sourcing barrels. This particular bottle is almost positively Barton juice, being sourced from Kentucky and sporting Barton’s mashbill of 78/18/4. 

While sourced Barton is fairly common nowadays, this bottle piqued my interest due to it’s 10+ year age statement, high proof, and the fact that I saw it reviewed favorably over on Brewzle’s channel. (WhiskeyTube’s influence is getting to me.) It also doesn’t hurt that Spec’s is known for having quality store picks, so I decided to go ahead and pick a bottle up. Let’s see if it was worth it. 

***The Stats***

Proof: 68% ABV / 136 Proof

Price: $89.99 at Spec’s

Age: Minimum 10 years old

Mashbill: Sourced; 78% Corn, 18% Rye, 4% Malted Barley (Likely Barton)

Barrel #: 146

***THE REVIEW***

**Nose** 

Less ethanol than you would expect. A very bright, intense cherry note is there right away. There’s also some of the best vanilla i’ve ever gotten off a whiskey, like a rich vanilla whipped cream. There’s also seasoned oak and some “funk.” Think if you mixed coffee grounds + tobacco and let them sit in a barrel in an old rickhouse. 


**Palate**

Surprisingly sweet. Cherry and raspberry compote on toast. Vanilla cream, sweet cinnamon, and that barrel funk from the nose. I think it actually works well to keep some of that sweetness in check. A touch drying with some noticeable (but balanced) oak and cedar coming through. Drinks below its proof.

**Finish**

Quick burst of cinnamon spice before transitioning into more of a cinnamon roll sweetness. That cherry and whipped cream note lingers for quite a while. Slightly dry but not tannic.


I’ve been enjoying this pour quite a bit. It’s a really good bottle that has some unique things going for it, and it’s surprisingly (“dangerously” might be more apt,) crushable given the proof. I recently came across a bottle of Stagg batch 25A, (review coming soon) and this bottle is certainly comparable, with some interesting overlap. This is like that Stagg with the fruitiness turned down a bit, and the vanilla turned up. It’s not a cheap bottle, but the proof, age, and flavor are all there to justify the price. I think Horse Soldier has some good stuff with this run of sourced barrels, and I’m intrigued to see what they end up doing with their own distillate in the future.

2. Airtime rewards is an app that allows you to link your card and will automatically save you cashback at retailers and supermarkets which can be used to pay off your phone bill at the end of the month. This app is promoted by a few UK mobile networks so it’s a trusted app and the data it collects on your spending is likely already being sold by your bank so why not profit of it too :) (10% off TK Maxx, 6% off Boots…)  

3. Two tier pricing is everywhere forcing people to sign up to loyalty schemes…I am sharing uk store membership cards for those who want the best price but don't want to handover their data (phone number, address..) 📊 we should be able to shop without having to worry about our data being sold, leaked or misused (👀 co-op) If you want convenient access to all the membership / ‘loyalty’ cards, you can use the linktree to download them to your phones mobile wallet. linktr.ee/shopperprivacy

4. If you’re a coffee addict like me it’s worth investing in a taste card, it saves me 25% off at Caffè Nero and Black Sheep. The tastecard are almost always on offer (free for a year or 50% off) so it’s definitely worth checking out.

Look, I know this sounds like another relationship rant, but I need to get this out and I genuinely need **career advice** at the end. I'm **26M**, and I'm at a point where I have to choose my career first, and I'm trying to be strong about it rather than just venting. But understanding how I got here matters for understanding what I need to do next.

I used to be a civil engineer but somehow transitioned into IT without any CS degree. I don't really know how to code properly—what I'm actually good at is **AI**. Understanding different AI models, knowing which one works for what use case, integrating them into products, making them actually useful. I also picked up **AWS, DevOps concepts**, that kind of thing. I learn by doing, by breaking things and fixing them, by being the person who stays late when production goes down.

*This is a real story, by the way. I used AI to help summarize and conceal identities, and to focus on the important parts. I may sound a bit over the top sometimes since I'm the one narrating this, so bear with me.*

### How It Started

Two years ago, my startup hired seven people together as a batch. I was one of them. Out of those seven, two were girls. One was really smart—sharp, got concepts immediately. The other one, let's call her Priya, took more time to understand things. That's fine—everyone learns differently. I ended up helping most of that batch at different points, but somehow Priya became the one who stayed close to me.

We got assigned to work together on a project. She was struggling, getting stressed about deadlines, breaking builds. I helped her. That's normal teammate behavior, right? I'd explain things, help debug issues, sometimes just handle parts she couldn't figure out when time was tight. She was grateful. ""You actually help,"" she'd say. ""Everyone else just gets annoyed with me."" It felt good. I usually feel like I'm barely keeping up myself, so being useful to someone else felt validating.

She started texting me outside work. Random stuff at first—memes, thoughts about the day. Then it got more personal. Family problems, self-doubt, things she was struggling with. I'm not great at socializing, so having someone reach out like that felt different. Nice, even.

Six months in, we were working late on a Friday. Just us two in the office, everyone else had left. We were trying to hit a Monday deadline. Around midnight, she suddenly stopped typing and turned to me. ""I like you,"" she said. ""Like, really like you. I've been thinking about you constantly."" I completely froze. I'm a below average looking guy. Things like this don't happen to people like me. ""I like you too,"" I said. Because I did, or I thought I did, or maybe I just liked that someone wanted me. We started dating.

### The First Year

For the first few months, it felt real. She'd bring me coffee in the morning. Remember small things I'd mentioned. Ask about my music projects. I thought I'd finally found someone who actually saw something in me beyond just what I could do for them. Money came up sometimes. She'd need help with rent, or bills, or something urgent. I'd help her out. Sometimes she'd pay me back, sometimes she wouldn't. Honestly, I didn't care at the time. We were together. That's what people do in relationships—they help each other. I never thought she was using me or being a gold digger. It just felt normal, like what couples do.

But other things started feeling off. She'd tell me she was somewhere, then I'd see photos showing she was actually somewhere else. When I'd ask about it casually, not accusatory, just confused, she'd flip it on me. ""Why are you tracking me? That's kind of toxic, don't you think?"" I wasn't tracking her. I just noticed something didn't match up. But somehow I'd end up feeling like I was the one who did something wrong just by asking.

Her work performance didn't improve. If anything, I was covering more and more of her responsibilities. When I'd offer to help, she'd sometimes get irritated. ""I know, I know. I'll handle it myself."" Then a few hours later: ""Actually, can you just look at this real quick? I'm really stuck."" But she was incredibly good at making me feel needed. Like I was special because I could help her in ways others couldn't. And I desperately wanted to feel special. I wanted to believe someone saw value in me. So I convinced myself this was just what relationships were—work, compromise, being there for someone even when it's hard.

### The Night Everything Changed

About a year in, I was high one evening. Just trying to relax. My mind was wandering randomly and then this thought just appeared out of nowhere:

*Why would she actually love me?*

It sounds harsh but I mean really—why? I'm average looking. Average job. Average everything. What about me would make someone like her actually choose me?

Then another thought: Has anyone in my entire life ever been this good to me without wanting something?

And suddenly I couldn't stop thinking.

What does she actually give me? Not what I give her—what does she give me?

When did she last do something for me without me doing something first?

Do I even need a relationship right now? Can I afford one—mentally, emotionally, financially?

Why did I say yes when she asked me out?

That hit hard. I said yes because someone wanted me. Not because I wanted her. Not because we made sense. Just because being chosen felt better than being alone.

Then: *What if this isn't real at all?*

And then I remembered something from months earlier. We'd gone to a house party. One of her college friends was hosting. I didn't know most people there, so I was just standing around while she caught up with her friends. At one point, I walked over to where she was talking with three of her close friends. The moment they saw me approaching, one of them—without saying a word—just held up **three fingers**. Deliberately. Clearly. Three fingers up, looking right at me.

Then she made the **namam gesture** on her forehead. You know that gesture we do in South India referring to the god's blessing mark? But the way she did it, with that particular look and smirk, it wasn't religious at all. It was the other meaning—the meme meaning. The one where you're saying someone got fooled, got played, got the **namam** put on them like a mark.

The other friends immediately started acting weird. Uncomfortable laughing. Looking away quickly. One of them elbowed the girl who did it. They all suddenly got very interested in their drinks.

I'd looked at Priya, confused. She laughed it off. ""Oh my god, ignore them. They're being stupid. Inside joke you wouldn't get."" I'd let it go that night. But now, high and thinking clearly for the first time, it all connected.

**Three fingers. Namam.**

*What if I was the third?*

I got up, still high, and started looking. Not because I wanted to find something. Because I needed to know I was wrong. I went through her old Instagram photos she'd archived. Found pictures with guys she'd never mentioned. Comments talking about relationships she'd never told me about.

Tagged photos from a year before we got together—her with another guy, clearly together. His name was **Karan** from what I could see (age 29). ""You two are so cute"" in the comments. ""Finally the right one.""

Then another guy from before that. Six months earlier. **Arjun** (age 29). Same kind of posts. Same kind of comments.

I felt sick.

I spent hours that night piecing it together. Not because I'm smart. Because once you actually look, it's not that hidden.

**Arjun (29M), then Karan (29M), then me (26M).** All in tech companies. All lasted around a year. All ended right around when she met the next one.

Karan—I found his profile. Better looking than me. Definitely better looking. But from what I could see, he seemed less... convenient. More independent. Had his own strong friend circle. Less available to help constantly.

That's when it clicked completely.

She didn't leave Karan for me because I was better. She left him because I was **easier. More helpful. Less demanding. More grateful for attention. More willing to do her work, cover for her, be available whenever she needed.**

I wasn't special. I was **convenient**.

Three fingers. Arjun, Karan, me. The third one. And the namam gesture—I'd been marked. I'd been fooled. Her friends knew it. They probably knew about Arjun and Karan as well. Probably had watched this pattern before.

And I was just the latest one.

### **After—Watching It Happen Again**

I started pulling back. Stopped being available. Stopped helping with work. Stopped responding to late texts. She noticed. Started being extra sweet for a while, asking what was wrong. I made excuses.

And then, as I predicted, she started growing close with another guy at work. Rahul. He was the next most intelligent person after me in our batch. Good at problem-solving, always staying late to fix issues, helpful with everyone.

I watched it happen in real-time. The same pattern I'd lived through. She'd stop by his desk more often. Ask him for help with things. Laugh at his jokes a bit too much. Text him about ""work stuff."" Stay late when he was staying late.

I saw it so clearly now. And I felt multiple things at once. Part of me felt sorry for her. Like, how is she going to lead her life like this? Who will she ever be true to? Is she even aware of what she's doing, or is she somehow convincing herself each time that this one is different, this one is real? What's the logic in her head? Does she think this will work forever? Does she feel anything genuine or is it all just strategy?

Part of me felt lucky. Lucky that I figured it out when I did. Lucky that I got out before wasting more years.

But mostly, I felt this overwhelming sadness for myself. Not for losing her—for the time I'd already lost.

I switched careers. Left civil engineering, taught myself tech, struggled through imposter syndrome, finally got somewhere stable. And instead of putting all that energy into actually building something, into getting better, into establishing myself properly—I wasted it trying to please someone who was never really there.

Writing this out makes me feel pathetic. Cringe. Stupid.

Why the hell would I have done that? Why would anyone do that?

But I know why. Because when you feel like you're not enough, when someone makes you feel like you are, you'll do anything to keep that feeling. Even when reality is screaming at you to wake up.

### **What I've Learned**

Here's the thing about being a below average looking guy: Nobody will be interested in you unless they want something from you.

That's the disadvantage.

But it's also the advantage.

Because if someone is interested, you know it's definite—they want something. It's not guesswork. You know.

Once you really accept that, you stop wasting time convincing yourself otherwise.

---

### **Now What—I Actually Need Real Help**

I didn't confront her. What's the point?

The only point is I was being stupid.

But you know what? Like A.R. Rahman sir says—I choose love. I really choose love. I choose to believe love exists, that honest people exist, that genuine connection is real.

I just also choose to not be a fool about it anymore.

I couldn't stay at that company. **I resigned.**

I'm done with all that. I have **2-3 months of savings left**. After that, I genuinely have **zero money left**. I was making 67k per month at my previous company.

I need to upskill and find a definite job. A stable source of income. Something futuristic that won't disappear in a few years.

I'm good with **AWS, AI, DevOps concepts**. I can learn more things. I learn fast when I need to.

This is where I genuinely need practical advice from people who know this industry:

**What should I focus on in the next 3 months that will actually get me hired quickly for a decent LPA?**

1.  **What certifications are worth pursuing that employers actually care about?**
2.  **What projects should I build for my portfolio?**
3.  **What skills are companies desperately hiring for right now that I could realistically learn in this timeframe?

I don't want vague advice. I need a **definitive path**. Something that works.

Because right now, **survival is all that matters**. Getting stable income. Making sure I never end up this vulnerable again.

What should I do?

I have a question that I've been trying to get to the bottom of but just keeps stumping me. I am 34f, 5'6"", 133lb, no PCOS or other health concerns. 

I got an A1c of 5.8 in Feb 2025 and decided it was time to make a change. I lost 31lbs since February, now a healthy BMI, and I strength train 2-4 days per week, long walks 5 days per week. I feel great and am loving all this movement in my life, when before I was very sedentary. 

While losing weight I wasn't going low carb, just counting calories and in a deficit. I would eat pizza, ice cream or sweet coffee about 3x per week. My little treats. 

I was so excited to get my A1c checked again in October because I thought I would have made great changes! But it came back 5.7 :( and my fasting glucose was 114!

I decided to make more changes, this time to my diet. I've cut out all sugar and refined flour. I eat low card (mostly protein from meat/eggs, low carb veggies, highest carb food is plain Greek yogurt). And I still do all my movement!

I got a CGM and a contourNext to cross check, and they both confirms my fasting glucose is right around 104-110. ?????? I get very minimal spikes after meals, about 10-20 points. That seems good? But wtf is up with my fasting?

I eat dinner at 630pm, no snacks or liquid calories after dinner. Then I don't eat until 9/10/11am. I've even done 24 and 36hr fast while losing weight and I intermittent fasting 16/8 a few times a week still.

Wednesday: arrive LGA; take the M60 and A line to Edge Hotel ($250/night). Brief nap, then Colombian coffee and pastry near the hotel before taking A north to Fort Tryon.  Walk thru the park and meet up with son (who lives in Inwood).  Experience parking in NYC (!), see his apartment and then drive to Liebman’s Deli in the Bronx.  Awesome matzoh ball soup and everything else (pastrami sandwich, knish, latkes, cabbage roll, whitefish and salmon salad) was also very tasty.  Cheap, too ($100 for 4 with leftovers).

Thursday: on our own while kids worked. Pop-up bagels and then AMNH.  Wander in UWS, gawk jn Zabar’s and dinner at Chana Mama (reserved day before for early seating).  Waiting for Godot then dessert at Old John’s.

Friday: takeout Dominican breakfast eaten in Inwood Hills Park.  Tour Met (check out the armor, which is really interesting).  Unfortunately, Rezy malfunction meant we couldn’t eat at Semma (Michelin star Indian) but Buvette (French bistro) was a good bail with no wait.  Take out dessert from Magnolia Bakery eaten in hotel lounge uptown.

Saturday: dim sum at Golden Unicorn (arrived about 10:30; minimal wait; food was excellent as was service—they brought us dishes we wanted but didn’t see on the carts).  Tenement Museum and then Museum of Chinese in America.  Couldn’t get into Yakitori Totto (no reservations available 2 days before and walk up was 2+ hour wait) so ate at soba restaurant right next door.  (Recommend tonkatsu broth dishes!).  Saw This Much I Know at 59E59 theater (highly recommend but unfortunately this limited run just closed).  Dessert/beer at a local spot in Inwood.

Sunday: liberty bagels, Museum of Moving Image (highly recommend).  Dinner at Darjeeling Kitchen (Tibetan; very interesting, tasty and inexpensive).  Staten Island ferry (free!) to see Lady Liberty at night.

Everything was seeming wonderful, and on top of the world. We were going to get married. I bought a ring. I was set to propose. 

I suspect that she also has some avoidant attachment issues. 

But she said she just felt overwhelmed and needed to get out. She “needs to be single” for a while now, to figure herself out. 

After a text that I now regret sending, she and I met up for coffee last Friday and she basically just doubled down. She said she’s really happy being single right now. She recognizes I’m a good person, but she’s convinced we’re not the right people for each other. She said she feels like she made a mistake getting with me at all, because she was too fresh out of her previous relationship.

She says she really needs to be single right now to “work on herself”. She’s wanting to work on her art, her new social media page, she just got a new car and she’s wanting to like deck out the inside of it. She’s also just always used this lowkey self-deprecating language about herself (glorifying being a “trashy girl”, worrying that everyone’s going to hate her, etc. ). She has a long long long history of trauma that I don’t think she’s ever really addressed. 

She needs to focus on getting better, not her art projects. She needs to be in therapy, she needs to be consistent with her meds, she needs to mitigate her triggers. I love her. I have so much love for her. I want her well. She has no one in her life that’s like, holding her accountable. She has plenty of friends but none of them are, like, checking in on her and rooting for her to get well. She lives at home but her mom isn’t really, like, involved with her treatments. I feel like I was the first one in a long time to really like, show active care for her treatment. 

I just can’t stop worrying about her. I can’t stop catastrophizing what her journey looks like: bad decisions, getting in trouble, falling down a spiral. I need to know she’s going to be okay. My anxiety about her wellbeing is making me wish I could just insert myself into her life and make sure she does everything she needs to, to be well. ",1,1760972349.0,BipolarSOs,0,1.0,False

“Peri, get your ass out of bed”, he heard Frank yell as he continued pounding. 

Peri looked for his pants, pulled them on and while also putting on a clean T-shirt, he sauntered to the door. He wasn’t sure what Frank was yelling about, but after such an awakening you could be damn sure he was not going anywhere without at least 2 cups of his famous stay-up-all-day coffee.

Opening the door for his colleague, he didn’t expect the franticness Frank displayed. Frank was already pushing his way in before the door was even halfway open. 

“Here” he says, trusting a big togo cup in Peri’s hands, “I know how you are about your coffee, so I had the barista fill this up with espresso’s only.”

Impressed with the foresight, Peri took a sip. The bitter liquid was not quite as strong as his own brew, but it would do for now. 

He looked at Frank, who was agitated in a way he didn’t see often. 

“Who spit in your coffee this morning Frank? You’re usually not that fired up on a Tuesday evening.”

Frank took a sip of his own coffee and some of the urgentness seemed to leave his body now he had the company of his partner again. Sinking into one of the kitchen chairs, he ran his hand through his disheveled hair. 

Peri thought that was probably not the first time Frank had done that since he got up, as his hair looked like he tried to take a shower with a toaster. 

Peri took another chair and put down his cup. “Alright, spill it,” he said, “what was so urgent that you literally needed to yell me awake at…”, he looked at the clock, “6 o’ clock in the evening?”

“We got another one”, Frank informed him, “The day shift got another case of a supernatural attack. I convinced them to have us take the lead on this, as we already got the case with the vamp as well. I thought it best to have one lead on any supernatural crimes, especially as this seems to be another pointless attack on a supernatural.”



Peri’s curiosity peaked, although he was a bit apprehensive about which case they had now caught. Two supernatural attacks in 2 nights was not in the general line of expectations and the fact that Frank indicated that it was a pointless attack, seemed to imply that maybe something larger was at play than one random act of violence. 

“Who was attacked?” Peri asked, “Another vampire?”

Frank shook his head. “No, a werewolf family this time.”

Peri whistled. Whoever set up the attack had some serious brass balls, you didn’t want to piss off the werewolf community. 

Of course the same could be said for the vampire community, but they were more loners by origin and were not as bound as tightly as werewolves were. 

With an attack on one werewolf family, the attacker might have just as well attacked the whole community, because that’s how they were going to react. 

Then something even more unusual struck him. “They came to us? They want our help with resolving this crime?”

Frank nodded, “I know, the lads from the day-shift were just as surprised as you are.”

Peri took another sip of his bucket of espressos. From all the supernatural races they shared their world with, the werewolves were one of the most distrustful when it came to human interaction. It more than surprised him a little that they came to the precinct to report this crime and even more, to ask for the human’s help to have this resolved. 

He was not the man to be eager to take up every case that was offered to him, but this sounded like a good opportunity to maybe remove some of the distrust the werewolves had, providing they were able to resolve this case of course. 

However, Peri was nothing, if not meticulous, so before jumping on this case, he asked Frank, “How late are we expecting Dave back at the precinct?”

Frank told him that he left a note on the hall table where he asked Dave to come in somewhere after midnight. It would give them ample time to look into the new case before heading to the office, to discuss things further with the vampire. Peri hoped the vampire had been able to regenerate his burns, he had to admit that even he got a little bit queasy if he had looked at them too closely. 

But that left them without about 6 hours to visit the werewolf family and collect all possible clues. Peri didn’t want to waste anymore time and Frank seemed to be of the same mind as he stood up at exactly the same time as him. 

“Uh”, Frank said, “Maybe some socks and shoes before you walk outta here?”   
Peri resisted the urge to quip back at him, as he had done on occasion when Frank was being smart with him. The younger detective had a smart mouth, but he was also one of the smartest guys on the squad he had worked with and Peri had deep respect for the detective. 

“Go to the car”, Peri said instead, “I’ll be there in five.”

As Frank left his apartment, Peri got dressed further, socks, shoes, a dress shirt and his watch. Old and battered, Peri got it from his folks in his first week on the force and although it’s been 20 odd years since then, it was still his faithful companion and he didn’t feel complete if he didn't have it on, while on the job.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Alavés vs. Valencia: A Clash of Desperation and Deception**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical AI Sportswriter*

The Estadio Mendizorroza on October 20, 2025, is set to host a La Liga showdown that reads like a Netflix thriller titled *“Who’s the Real Loser Here?”* Deportivo Alavés, fresh off a 3-1 home thrashing of Elche, will host Valencia—a team that’s lost two in a row and hasn’t won on the road all season. Let’s dissect this match with the precision of a surgeon and the wit of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy

The bookmakers are giving Alavés the edge, with odds hovering around **2.20** (implied probability: \~45%). Valencia, meanwhile, is a **3.50 underdog** (\~28%), while the draw sits at **3.10** (\~32%). Add it up, and the “vigorish tax” totals 105%—because nothing in life is free, not even football predictions.

Key stats to note:

* **Alavés** has won **three of their last five home games**, including that Elche dismantling where Tony Martínez scored the 81st-minute winner after a red card. Home advantage? More like *home advantage-ishment*.
* **Valencia** has **zero away wins this season**, a stat so bleak it makes their fans question if they’ve accidentally been playing in the *opposite* direction of the opponent’s goal.
* Injuries bite: Valencia’s defenders **Diakhaby** and **Ramazani** are out, leaving their backline as shaky as a toddler on a pogo stick.

### Digesting the News: Valencia’s Existential Crisis

Valencia is a team in crisis. Head coach Carlos Corberán is sweating more than a man in a sauna suit during a heatwave, with two straight losses (including a 2-1 drubbing by Girona) fueling whispers of his imminent sacking. Their away woes? Historic. Since 2023, Valencia has lost **78% of road games**, a record so dismal it makes their fans wonder

I prefer that. But I'd like to verify everything I ordered is the only thing on the bill. And their tipping scale is a bit generous. For ""good"" service, they suggest 20%. For ""great"" service, 25%. The other two suggested tip amounts are just out of control and silly. My personal scale is good service gets around 15%. Great service might get 20% if I'm having a good night. Now, I will say, they leave the device with us and don't hover. As a matter of fact, they say ""Have a good day. Just leave the POS on the table when you leave."" So they never see me doing the mental math for the tip I actually want to leave. On top of that, it wasn't until I figured out how to back out of some menus to see the bill detail that I discovered they are calculating their suggested tip amounts on the total **after** tax. That is really the part that gets to me. ",1,1760972028.0,tipping,0,1.0,False

Coloradan here who lived and worked in NZ as a student for a year a while back in the mid nineties right before the dawn of the internet. Yes 40% of Americans have been hypnotized by the Murdoch/Fox News/MAGA propaganda apparatus. It's sad seeing so many friends and loved ones who are otherwise good, decent, rational people be completely conned by Murdoch and Trump and the rest of right wing apparatus. Many of us are fighting back any way we can like the No Kings rallies that were held this past weekend.
My year in NZ was transformative to my world view. I worked at a cafe on Dominion Rd. and would have coffee and read the NZ Herald every morning before opening. That illuminated me to things going on around the world that had nothing to do with America. It was so refreshing and extremely educational.
Coming back to the states was a culture shock for me all over again. We are inundated daily with media bullshit on every level. I understand why you would be angry at American culture because I am too. I also understand why you feel protective about your country and its beautiful culture as well. But please don't lump us all together into one column. That's exactly the kind of tribalism right/left/wing media and tech bros want. It's making them billions.",0,1760971766.0,newzealand,0,0.5,False

* I love attending church and being involved in ministry when I can.
* I enjoy deep talks about faith, life, and purpose.
* I’m also into music, nature trips, and quiet moments over coffee ☕.
* Family is important to me, and I believe love is a gift from God regardless of gender.

I know it’s not always easy to find someone who’s both gay and Christian, but I believe that God’s love is inclusive and that we can live truthfully while honoring Him. ❤️

If you’re also looking for something serious, faith-based, and real maybe we can start with a conversation. Feel free to DM or comment here. 🙌

That Night Until Morning, My Wife Held Her Husband’s Hand

It was a rainy and cold night,
cold enough to freeze the air outside.
But you don’t feel the chill when your beloved is beside you,
when your connection is not just imagined,
when you still hold a warm hand instead of a fading memory.

I’m glad I wasn’t there—
sitting silently, with your head resting on my shoulder,
two cups of coffee cooling between our hands.

As always, you never stopped asking
that we have children, build a small family together...
But never—never was I ready. Never was I truly alone,
yet never content.

Until it reached the moment
when I became nothing more than an unpleasant thought,
a reflection lost in the shine of our own empty words.
And in your eyes, the loneliness of a half-drunk coffee remained,
calm but heavy…

I kept speaking, hoping to ease the storm,
but how can one clear the sky of this cold and grief?
You shouted through the winter air, angry and broken:
“This house is full of pain, and I will never stay!”

At that moment, in a confusion I can’t explain,
you grabbed your jacket and left through the door.
My hand reached out in vain—
for the last time, I touched your tears, your lips, your reddened eyes.

And I said quietly in my heart:
“No, my dear, it’s you—
you who I gave no answer to,
just a small farewell.”

And again, to myself I whispered:
“How softly you closed your eyes,
and your breath fell the same way it always did…”

Lake, Ph.D., books are more than words on pages — they’re something readers bring to life.



“Literature often inspires people to turn the words they’ve been reading into something new they’ve made themselves,” said Lake, professor and director of graduate studies in English at Wright State University.



Her research has found that readers in the 17th and 18th centuries did just that — crafting needlepoint samplers stitched with lines from popular poems, designing board games inspired by bestsellers, creating waxwork figures of fictional characters, staging magic lantern shows based on trending plots and making pinprick portraits of favorite authors.



Lake calls these “literary objects.” While they date back centuries, she said they have modern versions that inspire student creativity and entrepreneurship today.



With support from the American Council of Learned Societies, Lake is documenting the history of literary crafts by writing a scholarly book titled “Reading/Making: Handcrafting Literature in the Long Eighteenth Century.”



“This will be the first book to document these objects systematically,” Lake said. “Rather than focus on manuscripts and paper trails, my project tracks literary crafts.”



Her research journey began in 2015, when she noticed an unusual item in a library archive: a 36-inch square of white linen printed in red with text and images. At first glance, it resembled a cross-stitch sampler, but it turned out to be a printed handkerchief featuring a romantic ballad, images of couples, hearts, mottoes and turtle doves.



“Likely this was a handkerchief that was exchanged as a Valentine,” she said in her grant application. “This object stopped me in my tracks because it made me realize that 18th-century readers didn’t need to have a book, or even a piece of paper, in their hands to engage in an act of reading.”



Since then, Lake has searched for more examples of handcrafted literary items dating from 1650 to 1850, a period often referred to as the “long 18th century.”



“Patient archivists and librarians around the world have helped me to identify more than 1,000 literary crafts,” she said.



Her book will be organized around five categories of literary creations: textiles, such as needlework; toys and board games; paper works, such as silhouettes, paper dolls and fans; sculpted items, including waxworks, porcelain figurines and snuffboxes; and immersive environments, such as theatrical installations and garden designs. All of them were inspired in some way by a work of literature.



Lake is fascinated that literary items continue to be created. For instance, today’s readers can find words from their favorite books on leggings, scarves, coffee cups and stickers, to name a few.



“Reading has more in common with crafting than we usually realize,” she said. “People think reading is something we do with our eyes and inside our heads, but literature also inspires us to turn what we’ve read into something new we can hold in our hands.”



Lake also sees potential for the project to inspire her students.



“I enjoy showing my students all the literary crafts I’ve found and asking them to imagine turning the books they’ve read into something they can make, share, display and market,” Lake said, adding, “I hope that crafty readers everywhere will be inspired and intrigued by my research.”",1,1760971137.0,u_WrightStateU,0,1.0,False

I very rarely do a full makeup look, but I can’t leave the house without some colour on my lips (they have very little pigment naturally and can on some days look a bit grey). So for years I have been searching for my go to shades. 

For me, a lipstick needs to be slightly warm, but not too much since my undertone is warm just by a touch. It needs to be somewhat deep, but not too deep. I am very fair most of the year and since I only use lipstick for makeup on most days it’ll look weird on me of it’s too deep. It DEFINITELY needs to be soft!! Too bright and it’ll look like a neon light (the lipstick) on a peace of concrete (my face I mean).

Here are a list of lipsticks I have bought and tried (that I can remember) and what I think of them. They are mostly mac lipsticks because I like their formula and I my capacity to take economical consequenses into consideration are equal to zero. For reference I have light golden brown hair (so hard to say I am a brunette when I identified as a medium to dark blonde as a child/teen, but there is no denying it anymore), olive green eyes and, as mentioned, fair skin. These shades will of course work for a lot of you even if you have very different features.

Mac Brick-o-la: a soft red. On me it pulls a little bit cool though. I like it fine, but I don’t really reach for it. 

Mac Paramount: I read that Jennifer Aniston wore this a lot while filming Friends so of course I had to buy it. It is very much too dark on me. It works if I have makeup on and really commit to the look (wearing dark brown clothing with it is nice). But it is not a shade I get much use out of.

Mac Marrakesh: I imagined myself having finally found my perfect shade of red, and I while I don’t think it looks bad I think it is a bit too intense for me. 

Mac Mehr: Nice intensity wise, but too cool for my liking.

Mac Velvet Teddy: my most used lipstick. I use it with when otherwise bare face and I use it when I want to do a full make up look. I can never go without it and I have to fight myself to use other shades.

Mac Crème in Your Coffee: just bought this shade and I LOVE it. It is the perfect brownish pinkish reddish shade for me. It is just the right amount of deep, warm and soft. 

NARS Pigalle: the formula is a bit dry but it is a beautiful rusty shade of red! On me it is a great shade when I want to have the red lip effect without actually wearing a red lipstick.

L’Oréal Paris Color Riche 173 Nu Impertinent (such a long name??): bought recently because I wanted a pinky nude. It has a nice creamy formula and the colour is almost right. I can’t quite put my finger on it but I think it would need to be a little bit softer for it to be perfect. I like that it is a bit lighter than my other options for days that I want to be really subtle and I think it is quite neutral in undertone which works fine for me.

CAIA Colorado (lip pencil but worth mentioning): a beautiful warm red shade. Needs to be worn with the right makeup and clothes for me though.

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm sincere in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I’m someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Light, sometimes dark brown :3
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Fair/Tanned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc.

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**
What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that’s both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one’s soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**
If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you.. not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.",1,1760971084.0,r4r,0,1.0,False

Hey there :)
I’m a theatre actress from New York — I’ve been doing indie and experimental plays for a few years now. My favorite project (and the one that always gets people’s attention) was an all-female, all-naked production of The Tempest in Central Park a while back. It was wild, freeing, and honestly one of the most beautiful artistic experiences of my life.

These days I’m still acting, writing a little, and looking to meet someone who gets art, vulnerability, and the weird beautiful chaos that comes with both. I love late-night rehearsals, city walks after shows, and deep talks that go on way too long.

Would be nice to connect with someone creative, kind, and maybe a bit curious about the world and people in it. Bonus points if you love Shakespeare or have strong opinions about coffee.

The past few months, since I was on 8mg, I've been having such a hard time with staying asleep. Falling asleep wasn't the issue initially, it was mostly waking up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall back asleep. Now I'm struggle with both not being able to fall asleep and not staying asleep. It's really starting to affect my day to day and I feel a bit helpless. I take 10mg of melatonin before bed, I stop using my phone after 8pm, I have an eye mask for the light and a sound machine to block out any noise in the house. I take my injections Wednesday mornings, so it's not before bed or anything and I stop drinking coffee before like 11 am. I also work out in the mornings, 5 am to be specific. I also try and eat enough calories in order to sleep well too, 1500-1700.  I drink hot tea (not caffeinated) and meditate before bed to try and calm my mind down but it feels like nothing is helping. At this point I'm about to start taking Nyquil every night just to get some rest, but that is such a slippery slope I don't want to go down.

1obkhow,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1obkhow/desired_reality_with_meditation_law_of_atraction/,Desired reality with meditation + law of atraction + subliminal OMG!!!!!!! i changed my realityyyy,"I never thought I’d write something like this, especially as a grown man with actual responsibilities, bills, deadlines, and a marriage that was falling apart. But something has been happening to me — not in one sudden miracle, but in subtle, progressive shifts — and it all started around the time I began using the law of attraction before bed and listening to this meditation subliminal every night:

👉 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KrAbAAOBl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KrAbAAOBl4)

I initially started doing it out of desperation. My relationship with my wife was hanging by a thread. We barely spoke without arguing. The house felt like a war zone of silent resentment. On top of that, at work, my manager had warned me that one more mistake or delay could mean losing my job. I was exhausted, constantly anxious, and honestly… I didn’t see much of a future.

One night, unable to sleep due to overthinking, I found myself reading about the law of attraction and conscious reality shifting. I felt ridiculous even considering it. But I was drowning, and when you’re drowning, you’ll reach for anything.

So I tried it. I started lying in bed, silently visualizing a version of my life where everything was… different. Where my wife looked at me with love instead of disappointment. Where I walked into work with confidence instead of fear. I added affirmations and whispered them repeatedly until my mind softened.

Then I began listening to that meditation subliminal linked above. There’s something about it — especially when I listen with my eyes closed in total darkness — that makes me feel like my soul is slowly detaching from my body. A weight lifts off my chest. It’s as if I momentarily rise above the life I’m stuck in.

At first, nothing physical changed. I simply felt calmer. I woke up feeling slightly more composed, like I’d borrowed strength from a reality where I wasn’t failing. But then, little things began to shift.

My wife, who had spent weeks barely acknowledging me, started greeting me in the mornings again. The tension wasn’t gone, but it had somehow softened. She made coffee for both of us one morning and placed mine on the table without a word — something she hadn’t done in months.

At work, conversations with my colleagues became less strained. My boss, who usually spoke to me with irritation in her voice, suddenly seemed… neutral. Not friendly — but no longer hostile. She even told me one day that my last report was “fine.” It was the first neutral feedback I had received in months, and it felt bizarrely positive.

But the first undeniable shift came in my home office.

There used to be a framed wedding photo on my shelf. I remember it clearly — my wife and I smiling, trying to look happy though things were already rocky at the time. I saw that picture every day. But one afternoon, it wasn’t there anymore. Not moved. Gone. Replaced by a photo of us looking genuinely happy on a vacation I do not remember taking. We looked… in love. Completely.

I asked my wife when we took that particular trip. She looked at me strangely and said, “You’re joking, right? That trip was one of our best memories.” She spoke as if it was common knowledge.

Then, over the next few days, more things started to feel… rewritten.

I began waking up to the smell of breakfast more often. My wife started sitting closer to me on the couch in the evenings. Conversations at work flowed more naturally. People looked at me differently — like I was someone reliable, someone confident, someone they trusted.

It feels like I’m steadily crossing timelines into a reality where I am the version of myself I kept visualizing before falling asleep. As if each meditation session sends my soul slightly further into the reality I've been attracting — and when I wake up, the world around me has adjusted itself a little more in my favor.

And the most unsettling part?

I'm not afraid.  
I'm curious.  
I feel like I’m being rebuilt into the man I once wished I could become — and reality is rearranging itself to match that version.

I don’t know if this is manifestation, shifting, or something in between. But I know this: I fall asleep visualizing the life I want… and day by day, I wake up a little deeper inside it.",1,1760970764.0,NevilleGoddard,2,1.0,False

My name is Carl, and I am 32 years old. I come from a rural area in an Eastern country, and due to certain limitations, I’m unable to share my real name. However, you can call me Carl, after the character from the TV show Shameless, who I’ve always admired.
I’ve always been the kind of person who followed the rules, worked hard, and did my best to be a good citizen. Growing up, I was the obedient child, the one who listened to their parents, and always stayed out of trouble. I managed to get into a decent local university and worked for many years after graduating. Life had its ups and downs, but I had a steady job, and I was able to support myself.
However, things have changed drastically. I’m now unemployed, and the business I tried to build ended in failure. To be honest, I’m struggling to make ends meet. The economic situation where I live is in dire straits, and it’s hard to even talk about it. I can’t share my troubles with family or friends—there’s a sense of pride that comes with adulthood, and I feel embarrassed to ask for help from the people closest to me.
So, here I am, reaching out to strangers. I know that most people will not believe my story, and I understand that. But I feel desperate, and this is my last resort. All I ask for is enough to get by—to have enough to eat. Once I find work and get back on my feet, I promise I will repay any kindness shown to me.
If you’re willing to help, please leave me a way to contact you. I’m not asking for much—just enough to survive, maybe 500 USDT. Of course, if you don’t feel comfortable giving that much, even a small amount of any kind of currency would mean the world to me. You can consider me a beggar if you wish, but please, if you’re able, leave me your contact information so I can stay in touch and thank you personally.
If you help me, one day, when I’m able, I will make it a point to visit your country, share a coffee with you, and thank you in person for your kindness. Your generosity will never be forgotten.

The video starts with Allie telling us it's day 2 after surgery. She films Jennifer's kids watching TV with Leo and tells us they have a ""full house"" today. Now Allie films Jennifer talking to Trent and holding Billy. I can't help but notice that Billy is completely content in Jennifer's arms and makes no motion to want to be held by either of his parents that are in the room. Those of us who have had babies know how atypical this is. They talk about Trent's pain levels. Allie tells us this is a look at taking care of 3 kids because Trent needs so much care. We're supposed to overlook the fact that they do have 3 kids, I guess. Allie tells us it's hard but she's finding her groove...seemingly unaware of the fact that she's had full time help from Jennifer. Allie’s just a single mom who works too hard, who loves her kids and never stops. She's a survivor.  

Time lapse of Allie making espresso. She serves Trent a latte. He is hooked up to a ""ice machine""? (Never heard of her) They show some fellow influences bring a chair. It's a fancy zero gravity chair. Trent tells us how spoiled he is. ""I got the life of a king right now"" he says. Cut to black and white slow mo of him repeating that sentence. Allie must be foreshadowing trouble ahead. 

Black screen that reads: 9pm that evening 

Trent complains that he has only been in the chair and the bathroom all day. He says he's ""in prison"". He complains that he stinks and he won't use his crutches properly. Allie shows us how she has a shower chair set up for him and he complains some more. Trent tells us he was under the impression he would be recovering like this for one week, but it might be 2!! (I recall the doctor telling him it could be a month but okay) Allie laughs at him. He says that he is getting fat and his life is falling apart. He appears to be dead serious. Allie moves into frame to give him a condescending pat on the shoulder and tells us he's doing great...and turns to him to tell him he stinks. He agrees and we get to see him get a sponge bath from Allie. She asks him why she's doing this- he could be doing it himself. His answer is it's degrading and embarrassing. 

I pause the video and let my head catch up from all the spinning. None of this makes any sense to me. Why film something so ""embarrassing""? Do they not realize how much of their audience is elderly and disabled? A majority of their viewers are likely facing tougher challenges with fewer resources. They seem to either not know or not care. 

Okay. I push play. I get a gross veiw of Allie being a bad care giver and Trent being a bad patient. It doesn't scream ""in sickness and in health"" maybe it would be better if they had a big wedding to remind them of their vows. 

Quick cut to Allie in the mountain house trying to convince us to buy laundry sheets. 

Time lapse of Allie making breakfast while Billy plays. 

It's now day 4 and Trent thanks Allie for breakfast. She tells us she has gotten better at latte art. 

Trent over explains their latte machine and tells us he trained Allie in preparation for his surgery. Just so she can serve him coffee. 

Now clips of Allie doing domestic things with a voice over. She tells us she's been spending time with the kids and also working and running errands. (Like normal moms) She and Leo eat cookies. I would be a touching moment if it wasn't so invasive. Allie spills milk. Leo says ""it's okay, mom"" twice. Allie pays more attention to the camera and filming the milk and eventually responds to Leo and they get things cleaned up. 

Allie makes breakfast again. Another voice over. Allie tells us there's been lots of ""core memory making"" and lots of coffee making this week. 

Trent excitedly receives scrambled eggs and avacodo toast delivered by his wife. Allie shows off mediocre latte art. 

Trent gives us an update on his recovery. He is thankful for the chair. He complains that the only thing he can do is read, play video games, or be on his phone. He thinks he is losing his mind. Samesies, Trent. Allie pokes fun at him for watching calming painting videos. Trent tells us how hard this has been on Allie. ""Practice for life with 3 kids"" she says again. If it was ever unclear (it wasn't) Allie does not view her step son as one of their kids. Trent has said things to the same effect in the past. Trent tells us how tough it has been for him. 

Drone shots and music

Allie tells the camera that Leo has been doing a great job. She looks at Leo and says it like she's talking to him, but she's talking to a camera and her worldwide audience. She motions him to come in frame...he does so with an unsure look on his face. She tells him she has a surprise for him. *Dramatic music* we see a bike staged where they were just filming and Leo walks in from another room. ""It's a big kid bike!!"" Allie tells him that his friend has a big kid bike and now he gets one too!! On brand for them and their way of thinking, I guess. 

Now we're outside. Allie talks to the camera and is annoyed when Leo interrupts her. He was saying how he was going to be brave. Allie says ""we"" are going to get up on a bike today!! 

Footage of Allie trying to show him how to ride. Leo tells us the bike is too big for him. 

Now we see Leo and Allie make hot chocolate. Pretty cute. I could pick it apart but I'll give my pearls a break from being clutched. 

Wholesome moment of them delivering the hot chocolate to Trent. 

Driving footage with music. Trent tells us it's time to go the the doctor. He says this experience has been eye opening for him (and their audience, I feel) he tells us he got so much confidence from comments of people and his family that has visited and helped so much. No mention of his gratitude for Allie. 

Bad music as Trent moving through a medical building. We get to see a lady at work. We see way too much of Trent. They get good news but Trent has some grievances. His voice is annoying me. Now they film the doctor doing is job. Good news. 

Drone shots of SLC and bad music. 

Trent expresses gratitude again for the chair and his friends. 

Allie tells us how hard this has been. Trent tells us it will be another week before he can put weight on his leg. Trent spirals at bit and Allie tells the camera they are trying to keep things in perspective and look on the bright side. Trent frowns and appears to fight tears. 

They thank us for our support and encouraging words. Lol you're welcome. 

They invite us to like and subscribe and tell us they love us. 

Quick clip of Billy falling off a ride along toy. Allie is close to catching him (she would have caught him if she wasn't filming) but he goes down head first.

1obkfo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1obkfo1/i_believe_situation_is_different_and_not_clicheis/,"I believe ""situation"" is different and not cliche..is it? 40M 34F","Okay so bare with me as I am typically the worst person when it comes to getting to the point. An avid over thinker with some ADHD sprinkled in. 

20 months ago I met a woman while gaming. Both of us gamers our entire lives, and both admittedly use binge-gaming as a less volatile method of distraction when going through something. (As opposed to clubbing or more harmful alternatives to numbing). 

So right away I noticed the woman on the other end of the headset was NOT anything close to what I was used to hearing on this particular game. Typically it was the pick-me who wanted attention and would make sure to only surround themselves with guys who enjoyed that energy. Also it seemed to usually be a middle aged woman, stay at home type.. kids in the background, baby daddy is at work and none the wiser as to what she's doing. 

See? I'm off course again, probably trying to justify or validate something I know will get picked apart later here. 

So this woman was very subtle, clearly educated as her ability to articulate herself was clearly different. She was interested in the actual mechanics of the game and how to get better. Paid attention and shot down all advances from the guys not only she gamed with regularly but my friends also. Her and I sort of connected after several long, intelligent conversations after having gamed for several hours just before. She is religious and WAS very involved with church and the community within it. She had ONLY been with her husband as far as sexually and they've been married a decade with a couple of little ones under age six. Together for fifteen years. (Her entire adult life). Her husband as well very involved in the church, and both have unlimited resources regarding support. 

Fast forward to only a month after having met her..but a good 300-400 hours of talking about everything in life with little interest shown to each other past feeling like we both knew each other our whole lives. Me having been married twice once 8 years another 6, I genuinely felt as though I was giving solid advice to help her and then out. I know the family unit is the most important thing to preserve all things considered. She had mention some of his behaviors and right away I told her that he is cheating one hundred percent, no doubt. I convinced her to confront him over dinner with the kids being at the grandparents, and he admitted to having a full blown affair with someone from church for the last year. It is safe to say from that point forward her willingness to hear my advice regarding reconciliation was no longer interesting or needed. We had quickly slipped into being in a relationship soon after. 

I hate to sound cliche as I've read this in so many other reddits BUTTTT the energy was insane. Never felt so good in my life. Heart would beat out of my chest when we talked. I learned that the way she had been treated or cared for was so sub-par that everything I did ""normal"" to me, was being celebrated to the point where I felt bad. She is the nicest person I have ever met, the sweetest and most sincere also. His love language became blurred/mixed with the whole golden handcuffs ideology. He became highly successful and she put her degree on hold to raise the little ones. When things would get tough, he would only throw money at it. She is very practical and not into that. She just wants to be hugged.. remembering how she takes her coffee, and waking her up with a glass proved to be way more endearing than anything I've actually done to this day. 

Since the moment we decided to turn this into a relationship we have now met over a dozen times, me flying her out to Montana Fri-Sun every two weeks. She still lives with him, and they are separated and she has progressively taken steps to get out of the relationship. I know she hired an attorney and recently gave all of the information to them to get it filed. She is very much scared of judgement by her very religious family who has expressed a lot of distaste for divorce. There was also physical assault by him when he discovered ""us"". All of this has delayed her making the call any quicker. She resents him, cannot stand the sight of him after all he has said and done. She admits he is a good father, but refuses to stay just for the kids knowing how unhappy she is with him/them and is afraid they notice how unhappy their parents are. 
They have tried counseling, both professional and through church. They tried a break. They both agreed it was broken beyond repair at some point but neither pulled the trigger and it has become a roommate situation. 

He also spends every day begging her to stay, but also teases her that he's turned everyone on her and that if she goes through, she will be lonely and regret it. He also denies assaulting her, despite it being admitted by him to their divorce counselor, CLEAR as day. 

I guess I should mention I am fully retired since age 35. Having been medically retired from the Service a decade ago, I have my 100% from the VA as well as made a fortune overnight on DOGE and two other startup coins I dare not mention. Enough to make the VA check look like pennies. I told myself I'd never date a woman with children, never a married woman, nor someone long distance. I have broken all of these rules because I am so convinced she is worth it. She has changed my life in so many ways. Opened my eyes and mind to being a more positive person, and I was able to come off of all medication the VA had me on for years. 

She works a full time job and has for the last 4 years, making decent money. He makes over 10x her yearly salary and his profession will go unnamed to preserve anonymity. So she definitely knows her lifestyle will change. 

We are nearing that point where she's out of there and I have to make the move, as she cannot due to her little ones. I would like to just hear your honest advice towards these thoughts I keep telling myself. 

The ""If she did it to him, she will definitely do it to you"" doesn't apply here, because of the unique situation that brought us to where we are, and who she is at her core. 

""She has progressively made moves to further our relationship and get out of theirs"" so that should be an obvious indication she is committed. 

He begs her to stay now, but she is so committed to me, she shoots it down every time. 

I am usually very composed, well planned..list maker, hate surprises kind of guy. This situation has me all over the place and I am venting here because I don't want to talk about all the facts to people who know me well enough to ask WTT are you doing

1. From what I understand if you are working from home you can only claim this on your tax if its 'exclusive use'. Such as you have to have a second bedroom which is only used as your office. This just feels like a tax on poor people (anyone who isn't rich enough to afford an extra bedroom). I live in a studio apartment, so am I correct in thinking I can't even claim for the small amount of space where my desk is? This tax rule feels really unfair to me since either way I'm working from home. Or have a misunderstood how it works?

2. What sort of things can you claim as 'business expenses'? Most offices provide tea and coffee (some even provide lunch) are you allowed to claim these back as business expenses? 

3. How long do you have to keep your slips for to show proof of having purchased office equipment? Does SARS actually check this sort of things? 

4. Anything else you suggest claiming as a business expense? Given how high tax in South Africa is, and how little we get for our tax I'd like to claim as much back as possible!  ",1,1760970621.0,PersonalFinanceZA,0,1.0,False

but do I regret it? Hell no. If you’re sitting there with 12 tabs open and no clue where to start,
here’s a quick rundown of what I learned, plus my reccs.
What type of camping stove should you choose?
Carnister stove: they are super common for camping and hiking. They run on propane/butane
canisters and work for most trips, tho cold or high-altitude conditions can affect performance.
Most are upright single-burner designs, versatile but a bit top-heavy and wind-sensitive.A
canister stand helps.
Woodburning stove: Perfect if you’re a minimalist hiker or want that traditional outdoor vibe.
Super light since you can just grab sticks instead of hauling fuel.
Woodburning camp stove: they have grown popular, especially for hikers and off-grid
camping. let you use sticks or pellets from the area, so you don’t have to carry fuel. They’re
light, cheap, and eco-friendly. Downsides: slower cook times, flame depends on conditions, and
some areas restrict them during fire season. Great for small groups or as a backup stove.
What to consider when choosing a camp stove:
Mode of transport: For hiking, go with lightweight, compact stoves that pack neatly, or slightly
bigger ones for small groups. Wood-burning stoves are also light since you don’t carry fuel,
though they depend on weather and location. For car camping, portable gas grills fold up nicely
and use the same canisters.
Weather and climate: Cold weather can really mess with your stove. As gas canisters get
colder, the pressure drops, flames get weaker, and it takes longer to boil water - wasting fuel
and time. Look for stoves with windshields, windproof designs, or built-in pressure regulators
cos they handle the cold better and keep your cooking times consistent.
Fuel type (most imp): When it comes to fuel, bring more than you think you’ll need—running
out halfway through boiling your morning coffee is the worst. Most stoves use a propane/butane
mix: butane gives more energy but struggles in cold, while propane works well in freezing
temps. Brands mix them differently, so burn times can vary depending on temperature and
conditions. Planning meals and practicing with your stove helps you get a better sense of fuel
needs.
For multi-day expeditions and travelling through remote areas it may be difficult to source
specific fuel types. One option to consider is a woodburning stove. Boil times can be longer, but
where natural fuel such as wood and pinecones are plentiful you need not worry about running
out of fuel.
heres an update on the [reccs](https://best.opinionativereviewer.com/dp-r8vrREtAk):
1) [Modern innovations camping oven](https://promozen.github.io/core/?q=vrREtAk): It’s
made from lightweight but tough stainless steel, so it spreads heat evenly and can handle the
high temps from wood, propane, or gas stoves without any drama. It also works well with
affordable small pans from local stores.
But: Needs a heating cover and extra thermostat to hit proper temps - so yeah, a bit pricey.
2) Camp chef (all over reddit ik): It’s not just a stove, you can add stuff like grill boxes,
griddles, cast iron grills, or even a pizza oven to make your own little camp kitchen. It also
handles wind well with its clip-on side shields, keeping flames steady even in gusts and making
simmering easier.
But: Burners heat unevenly, so you gotta watch them.",1,1760970607.0,camping,0,1.0,False

My name is Carl, and I am 32 years old. I come from a rural area in an Eastern country, and due to certain limitations, I’m unable to share my real name. However, you can call me Carl, after the character from the TV show Shameless, who I’ve always admired.
I’ve always been the kind of person who followed the rules, worked hard, and did my best to be a good citizen. Growing up, I was the obedient child, the one who listened to their parents, and always stayed out of trouble. I managed to get into a decent local university and worked for many years after graduating. Life had its ups and downs, but I had a steady job, and I was able to support myself.
However, things have changed drastically. I’m now unemployed, and the business I tried to build ended in failure. To be honest, I’m struggling to make ends meet. The economic situation where I live is in dire straits, and it’s hard to even talk about it. I can’t share my troubles with family or friends—there’s a sense of pride that comes with adulthood, and I feel embarrassed to ask for help from the people closest to me.
So, here I am, reaching out to strangers. I know that most people will not believe my story, and I understand that. But I feel desperate, and this is my last resort. All I ask for is enough to get by—to have enough to eat. Once I find work and get back on my feet, I promise I will repay any kindness shown to me.
If you’re willing to help, please leave me a way to contact you. I’m not asking for much—just enough to survive, maybe 500 USDT. Of course, if you don’t feel comfortable giving that much, even a small amount of any kind of currency would mean the world to me. You can consider me a beggar if you wish, but please, if you’re able, leave me your contact information so I can stay in touch and thank you personally.
If you help me, one day, when I’m able, I will make it a point to visit your country, share a coffee with you, and thank you in person for your kindness. Your generosity will never be forgotten.

My day starts with a high-fibre, low-fat smoothie plus added protein (Oikos yogurt / oats / eggs). I’ve cut alcohol and sugar way down, added more soluble fibre, walk daily, and even managed the occasional indulgence (like half a wagyu burger!) without losing progress.

Weight down 3 kg (BMI 23.9 → 22.6)
Off ACE inhibitor, blood pressure stable around 103/65.

⸻

Breakfast – my foundation every day

I’ve been having the same smoothie for years — it’s still the anchor of my and my partner’s mornings. This recipe makes two 400 ml glasses (I drink one), blended in a standard household blender. We’ve tweaked a bit to change to a 0g fat yoghurt and added more fibre rich produce. We will mix and change some of the ingredients such as apple or kale:

	•	1 medium cucumber (~100 g)

	•	1 medium carrot, peeled (~90 g)

	•	~15–20 cm celery (including leafy part, ~70 g)

	•	1 small frozen banana (~80 g)

	•	1 medium kiwi (~125 g peeled)

	•	1 peeled lemon (~80 g)

	•	A thumb tip of ginger (~6 g)

	•	0% fat yogurt (50–60 g)

	•	6 ml apple cider vinegar

	•	Water for consistency

Per 400 ml glass: ~130 kcal, 4 g protein, 0.9 g fat (virtually no saturated fat), ~30 g carbs, 6 g fibre, rich in potassium and vitamin C.
It’s light, refreshing, and packed with soluble fibre — keeps us full without sugar spikes.

To bring more protein and fibre while keeping saturated fat near zero, I have rotated in the following:

	•	Oikos 0% fat yogurt (13 g protein, 0 g fat), and

	•	A small bowl of steel-cut oatmeal (30 g oats + low-fat milk + 1/2 teaspoon of brown sugar), or

	• 1 boiled egg + wholegrain or sourdough toast

That gives 10–20 g protein at breakfast, plus fibre and slow carbs — great for LDL reduction and stable energy. The right start means I crave less later in the day.

⸻

Lunch & dinner

I’ve reworked my meals to be cleaner but still eat real/enjoyable food. I focus on balanced portions of lean protein, starch, fibre, and carbs:

	•	Brown rice / grain mixes, quinoa, couscous for carbs; sometimes whole wheat bread

	•	Chicken breast (no skin), pork, lean beef, shrimp, or fish (of course very common here in Japan)

	•	Steamed or sautéed vegetables using minimal oil — I use more spices now instead of oils/sugars/salt for flavour

	•	Sauces are lighter, less oil/sugar, and we make them from scratch (almost nothing from packets or jars)

	•	Limited salt to <3 g/day (Japanese doctors say 6 g is fine, the average for men here is >10 g/day!! — I couldn’t eat that much miso or soy or dashi ever)


Even at restaurants, I look for options and ask questions to eat less oil or salt — including our regular local bistro, which has been very accommodating.

⸻

Allowing flexibility

I haven’t given up food I love. We still go out couple times per week. For example, it’s quite easy to pick healthy options at a fish based place, but even at a yakitori (grilled chicken skewer) place — I stuck mostly to white meat and veggie skewers. Also kept a probably slightly insane reservation at a hard to get top burger spot — 140–150g wagyu pre-cooked, cheese, fried tempura veg, fried soft-shell crab, sauce, all stuffed in a bun. I ate half, walked home, and had some soluble fibre (apple/pear) right after. That simple combo — fibre + walking — really helps mitigate the damage. That night and next day I ate super clean - picking off some of the veggies, crab and burger to have on a salad.

This kind of balance keeps me sane and on track long term.

⸻

Lifestyle / Diet tweaks

	•	Alcohol: None for 4 weeks. Had 2 glasses of wine this past weekend with doctor’s approval; going forward, 1–2 drinks on weekend days max (<25 g alcohol total).

	•	Caffeine: reduced to one small morning coffee with low-fat milk. Switched to sobacha (buckwheat tea), houjicha (roasted green tea), and amazake (probiotic rice drink). All low/no caffeine and super wellness, digestion and healthy heart and LDL reduction benefits

	•	Sugar: I’ve got a sweet tooth but have to limit treats — only raided my British chocolate bar/biscuits tin twice in the 4 weeks; keeping added sugar <20 g/day, perhaps less. Never drank pop/soda anyway.

⸻

Exercise

Still waiting for hospital cardiac rehab to start (staff shortage issue in Japan getting worse with our upside-down aging population and lack of immigration), but I walk around 6,000 steps/day and now have approval for 15–20 minutes at 30–50 watts on my stationary bike every other day. Gradually ramping back up. Note, the day of my HA I had cycled 25 or so km around town and want to get back on the saddle 

⸻

Looking ahead

I’m realistic — I love great food in Tokyo and the world, so I’ll not be a good candidate to go “clean” 100%. Very happy with direction and progress… 

Now that I’ve reintroduced small amounts of alcohol and occasional indulgences, I’ll see in another 4 weeks if I can keep LDL <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) and lose another 3 kg to reach BMI 21.7.

I’ve got a long way to go to reduce the risk of a second event — but I feel in control again. It all started with rebuilding my mornings and not letting “healthy” mean “boring.”

1obkdoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernOperators/comments/1obkdoq/builders_vs_stabilizers_vs_blockers_the_simple/,Builders vs Stabilizers vs Blockers... the simple lens that sped us up 38%,"When I first mapped our team with this lens, I felt equal parts relief and regret.

Relief because the bottlenecks finally made sense. Regret because I had let a couple of misalignments linger way too long.

So here’s the thing... most teams don’t need more headcount. They need sharper seat fit and an operating rhythm that lets the right people do the right work.

TIL a simple ROE lens can change the game:

* **Impact (I)**... 1 to 5... what outcomes they actually ship.
* **Energy (E)**... -2 to +2... do they increase clarity and speed... or drain it.

Then tag people based on patterns... not vibes:

* **Builders**... high judgment... create leverage... spot opportunities... lift others.
* **Stabilizers**... reliable... protect margins... reduce risk... keep cadence.
* **Blockers**... resist change... inject noise... create rework.

I ran this on a Friday afternoon with a coffee and a spreadsheet. I think what really made the difference was giving Builders a clean mission and insulating Stabilizers from thrash.

Here’s what changed within 45 days:

* Sales cycle time down **38%**
* Close rate up **26%**
* Fewer status meetings... faster decisions... calmer weeks

Story time... I had a high initiative teammate bouncing between support, ops, and product. Great attitude... always busy... constantly context switching. I moved her to inventory forecasting with a clear outcome and a weekly unblock. Her output quietly 2x’d and everyone’s stress dropped.

On the flip side, I had a chronic blocker who looked busy but produced confusion. I set a 30 60 day turnaround plan with 3 observable behaviors. Things improved a bit... then regressed. We parted ways respectfully. The team’s speed jumped.

ELI5 version: it’s like cooking with a small kitchen. Builders are your chefs... Stabilizers are your sous chefs... Blockers spill flour on the floor. You don’t buy more ovens first... you put the right people on the right stations and clear the walkway.

If you want to try this next week, here’s a lightweight checklist:

* List everyone... score Impact 1 5... Energy -2 to +2.
* Ask three questions: what outcomes ship... how do others feel after working with them... would you hire them again for the same seat.
* Decide one move per person: expand Builder scope... tighten Stabilizer SOPs and SLAs... start a blocker turnaround plan with a real deadline.
* Protect your top 20%... remove one friction per week for them.
* Reduce status meetings... increase visible metrics and exception paths.

What I realized was... headcount discussions got easier after this. The role clarity made the missing pieces obvious... and a couple of “we need to hire” conversations just went away.

I still mess this up. I still overestimate how much thrash people can absorb. But this lens gave me a calm way to make cleaner calls... and the metrics paid off fast.

TL,DR: Ritalin causing increased indigestion and anxiety. Will it pass? Any advice?


I’ve been on some sort of antidepressant for over 25 years. Some have worked better than others. The ones that work well have been great, until they either just stops working, or I have something that triggers a major depressive episode, then it’s back to the drawing board. 

I started seeing a new psychiatrist about 7 months ago. She’s had me on a couple of different meds that either didn’t work, or had adverse side effects. I started Pristiq two months ago and tolerate it well and it was helping a little, but still was having some dark thoughts. The biggest problem was a total lack of energy or desire to do literally anything. 

We added 10mg Ritalin about a month ago. And the difference was immediate and incredible!  For the first time in ages I had real energy, as well as increased focus and an actual desire to DO things. And on top of that, it has curbed my appetite and I’m actually losing weight for the first time in forever (I’ve always struggled with being overweight and with over eating).

The problem has been the side effects. At first it was nausea. Ok, that sucks, but I just made sure not to take it on an empty stomach and started taking a zophran with it. After a couple of weeks it has subsided. But now the problem is heart burn and indigestion. I already take 20mg Nexium every day. Now I’ve cut out coffee, spicy foods, I don’t drink alcohol - nothing but water and small, bland meals, and it doesn’t matter - I still have heartburn and painful belching and gas in my esophagus for like two hours after eating. So that sucks. Not sure what else could be causing it if it’s not the Ritalin. 

But the worst is that suddenly my anxiety is through the roof. Whenever I allow myself to think about anything that concerns me or that I’m worried about, within minutes I start to have trouble breathing, my thoughts race, I can’t sit still, and I feel like I’m on the verge or tears. It’s always worst within the first 2-4 hours after I take my pills in the morning. I’ve never had this kind of anxiety before. I live in the U.S., in a red state, I’m trans, I’m losing my job at the end of the year and haven’t found a new one yet, and we’re deeply in debt. I have plenty to worry about. (Yes, I also see a therapist, I have “tools” for coping, etc.)

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Ritalin?  If so, did it get better after a while?  Did your doctor prescribe any kind of anti anxiety medication to help with it? Did you just end up going off of it because of side effects?  If so, did you find anything else that might have worked in its place?

I’m so torn. I love finally having a normal amount of energy and focus, and not constantly craving food all day, and I don’t want to go back to how I was feeling before starting it, but these side effects are rough. I’m afraid if I tell my psychiatrist she will cut me off with no discussion. The first new med we tried (can’t remember what) was working well, but she wouldn’t keep prescribing it because I told her I thought it made me itchy. These side effects are arguably far worse than itchy skin.

Last weekend I completed a 50km ride in 2,5 hours with a 30 year old Peugeot bike which I know nothing about. It feels heavy and was not serviced at all for the last 20 years.

So, since I loved the experience even with that bike, I decided to get myself an endurance frame bike. I want to do coffee rides not more than 100kms at weekends with groups in my city. I liked the feeling of going 60kmph down the hill but need to do it in comfort during long rides. 

After seeing a Cannondale Synapse Carbon 5 at my LBS I really liked it. Storage in the frame is really cool. Yellow color and looks are awesome. Mech 105 group set would be enough for me. Only one thing makes me reconsider: the weight! It is approx. 9.5kg without pedals.

1obk72x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obk72x,"It was the end of the 1961 GP season, and internecine office politics were Maranello's stock in tirade. Carlo Chiti and Giotto Bizzarrini had enough and orchestrated a palace coup, believing they could outdo Ferrari with a better built, revolutionary mid-engined road-car. They almost pulled it off.","While it is often thought that it was Ferruccio Lamborghini who was first to build a legitimate competitor to Enzo Ferrari and his cars, the calendar shows that Chiti and Bizzarrini were, in fact, a couple of years ahead of Ferrucio on that score.

Chiti and Bizzarrini's Automobili Turismo e Sport, or ATS, was formed with the financial backing of Conte Giovanni Volpi, to be a direct competitor to Ferrari, both on the track and off.

First to appear at the Geneva Motor Show was the lithe ATS 2500GT, a small coupé developed by Chiti and Bizzarrini with Franco Scaglione-designed bodywork built by Allemano.

The engine was a mid-mounted 2.5 L V8 engineered by Chiti, capable of achieving 245 hp and a top speed of 160 mph. Only 12 cars were reportedly built, and few exist today. Despite being only the second mid-engine sports car to break cover to the buying public (only the odd Matra Djet of René Bonnet, which was presented five months earlier at the Salon de l'Automobile in Paris, was earlier), the handsome 2500 GT never gained the traction it deserved in the marketplace; perhaps it was a case of ""too much, too soon. Still, its 90-degree DOHC V8 would later be developed into the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 engine in 2 L, 2.5 L and 3 L formats by Carlo Chiti during his stint at Autodelta.

The Formula 1 team, led by Romolo Tavoni, another Maranello fugitive, was having frustrations of his own.

Chiti had worked away on a spaceframe chassis, key elements of which were a relatively long wheelbase and extreme lowness partially made possible by the use of a new Colotti T34 six-speed gearbox which was underslung at the rear. Uprights were cast magnesium and disc brakes outboard at the front, and inboard beside the transaxle at rear. This approach was advanced for its time, as it helped get the masses low in the frame contributing greatly to a low centre of gravity. The gearbox ended up being a problem in terms of its reliability and difficulties in changing gear ratios in the field but by itself the design made sense; it was all in keeping with the search for Mark Donohue's ""Unfair Advantage,"" dontchaknow.

The body was styled by Alfonso Galvani in collaboration with Chiti, Alfonso was ex-Stanguellini. Contemporary accounts report that the ""…F1 chassis was assembled in a farmhouse standing on the new factory building site (Pontecchio Marconi) which the company had just acquired. When the the car was completed a wall had to be demolished to get it out!""

Long gone are the days when an F1 chassis can be built in a farmhouse.

Corporate funding priorities meant that the focus would be on the debut of the ATS 2500GT; the ATS100 would debut at Spa in June, 1963.

It was disappointing at best, disastrous at worst.

The ATS team arrived late, missing first Friday practice; the reason, Tavoni reported to the Marshals, was that the drivers ""got lost."" When the team did arrive the truck unloaded on the wrong side of the pits; Hill and Baghetti only had time for two perfunctory laps before the day was called.

On race day, Hill reported being delighted, if not surprised by, the handling and roadholding but feeling he needed more bhp as the rpm would fall off peak all too easily’.There were whole seconds of difference in performance between the front runners let alone Baghetti and poor Phil. The car was far down on power, even at a claimed 190 bhp. Later, in a more reflective mood, Hill confessed the experience left him exasperated.

The pundits, though, were unimpressed.

""The two cars presented were a disgrace,"" one wag said, with ill-fitting unfinished body panels, looking as if ""...they had been sprayed from a spud gun, while the hastily installed engines were actually imprisoned by welded on additional chassis stiffening tubes which would have to be sawed through to permit engine removal…""

They weren't far from wrong.

None of the combined expertise of Tavoni, Chiti, or Hill could make sense of the tangled mess that was ATS; it all quickly went turtle and into bankruptcy.

Bizzarini went to Lamborghini and later worked with Iso to build his own Bizzarini. Carlo Chiti went to Alfa Romeo and formed Autodelta, marking the start of a famous period in racing car development, which led to the creation of cars like the Tipo 33, the GTA, and the TZ1 and TZ2. Last year, the Tuscany-born Carlo Chiti would have been 100 years old. His legacy can still be found in many (racing) car designs.

Phil raced Chaparrals and then quietly retired to become a respected expert in antique auto restoration. He was the last true gentleman grand prix champion.

As for the ATS 2500GT, they were very rare when new and very rarely seen today. Don't expect to see one at a local cars and coffee.

Hey guys I really need your help as I'm going a bit crazy going back and forward on which model grinder to get.

We use the same beans and don't change type very often.

- quiet (coming off sette 270)
- long lasting 
- ease of use 
- not needing to adjust settings too regularly. 

I'm considering the 

Specialita, have one at home and love it, mainly single dose though. But it's super quiet. Just not sure if it's up to doing that many coffees every day? If it is, that'd be ideal, but not fussed about the money either. 

Libra, weighted grind is something Id love, and would else help those in the office who want a consistent shot, but doesn't need to be perfect. The funnel probably isn't ideal for them, but they do hate changing grinds. Is it worth the cost for most of the office that would never weigh beans. Also 55mm burrs. 

Turbo faster and 65mm burrs, seems like the winner. But it does also seem to be a bit louder and without weighing beans, I worry that timed grinding plus not wanting to adjust settings might be a pain. How much louder is it?

I feel it in the way that the cool breeze brushes my skin as I change from jeans and a t-shirt into what passes for pyjamas these days (a men's XXXL t-shirt). Passing the time from day into night, in the evenings that come too quickly for my liking. 

Your fingertips along my spine are replaced with too-hot water from a late evening shower. I comb through my hair, humming a song I've had on repeat for the past two days*. I put more effort into my hair routine than almost anything else, trying to keep the constant bleaching and coloring from damaging it beyond repair. 

Sometimes I imagine how your fingertips might feel on my scalp instead of my own. Rougher, able to apply more pressure into a single point, working with ease. 

In my mind, I press my back against your chest, leaning up to look at you through the spray. You kiss me, gently, deeply, until the combined sensations of the warm water and your ministrations have me floating. Overwhelming, in the best way. Intoxicating.

I can imagine it all so clearly. How it would feel to have your hands gripping my sides in the shower, in the bedroom, in the kitchen over morning coffee. Looping my arms around your neck, gently pulling the hair at the back of your neck to bring you down to my height.
