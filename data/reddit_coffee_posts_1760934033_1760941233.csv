1obcinb,https://i.redd.it/9x78odzxl7wf1.png,EcoModities‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî Latest EMX Update & Commodity Climate Pulse,"Here‚Äôs a fresh update from **EcoModities‚Ñ¢**, our climate-sustainability index for commodities that merges ESG/transition data with market signals.

# üìä Key EMX scores (last 3 months)

* Corn : **95.89**
* Cocoa : **91.39**
* Coffee : **74.47**
* Sugar : **31.87**
* Wheat : **97.75**

These numbers reflect how ‚Äúeco-premium‚Äù pressures (such as climate policy, rainfall/heat anomalies, supply-chain stress) are being priced into these markets. Lower score = downward adjustment from recent elevated stress/risk; higher = sustained premium.

# üß† What it means

Over the past quarter, the EMX readings show that commodities like **coffee** and **sugar** are seeing a sharper pull-back in sustainability/transition risk pricing, while **corn** and **wheat** remain comparatively resilient.  
In short: the market appears to be normalizing after a period of elevated climate-risk premia. If you‚Äôre writing about commodity outlooks, this may inform both trade ideas and thematic coverage.

I‚Äôm a 34-year-old Senior Software Engineer who recently moved to Pune for work.
To be honest, life‚Äôs been feeling a bit too quiet lately. Most of my days are spent between code, coffee, and screens ‚Äî and somewhere along the way, I realized I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to outside of work.

I‚Äôve always been an introvert, the kind who‚Äôs comfortable being alone ‚Äî but there‚Äôs a difference between solitude and loneliness. Lately, it‚Äôs been more of the latter. I‚Äôve been feeling a strong pull to connect again ‚Äî to meet people I can talk to, share thoughts with, explore the city, or just sit over a cup of coffee without overthinking the silence.

I‚Äôm not looking for anything fancy ‚Äî just genuine friendships and real conversations.
If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys talking about life, art, movies, poetry, tech, or random midnight thoughts‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd love to connect.

If any of you have been in a similar phase, or know local meetups or communities where people hang out, I‚Äôd really appreciate your suggestions.
And if you just feel like talking, my DMs are open. Sometimes a small conversation can change how a day feels. üôÇ

1obcgai,https://i.redd.it/yvy9k8zil7wf1.png,10 year old bin maintenance,"TL;DR: I have an old thriving indoor DIY-bin, that needs some maintenance.


So about a decade ago, I was living in a small flat and was wondering if I can compost indoor.

Turns out there are compost worms you can feed your leftover kitchen scraps (with exceptions).
Wait... Keeping several hundret worms indoors? So you buy an expensive worm-home, expensive worms and substrate and these little critters just work for you? No way!

I was a broke student at that time and decided to build the bin myself. So I bought ""Euroboxes"", stackable boxes from the hardware store, drilled holes in them, modified the lid (again and again), ordered ""compost worms"" online and just tried it myself.

What can I say? It worked! I still live with them happily. But it is time for some maintenance

I stacked 3 boxes and coveref the stack with a lid:
- The first box is for collecting the juices and worm-tea.
- The second box has a bunch of small holes drilled into it (to let the liquids drain into the first box). The worms usually live here.
- The third box is optional and funktions similar to the second box. The holes in the bottom are bigger here to let the worms ""climb"" from the second into the third box.
- The lid has a lot of holes for gas exchange and moisture balance.

I usually feed the worms about every or every other day whenever I have food for them.

Their food is mainly vegetables, fruits, coffee grounds (from a french press) and paper.
I avoid meat, onions and garlic, citrus fruits, dairy.

I keep things liberal and whenever I see a dis-balance I just adapt what I am doing.

I do not have problems with mold, never have worms fleeing, rarely have drain, so far no note-worthy infestations.
The only ""problem"" I have, is that the substrate feels very spongy and wet. Like weird clay.

About once per year I need to empty the lower-worm box (second box), because it gets full. I usually wait for them to climb into the last (third) box.

But my second box is not getting full. I keep adding to it and it just flattens and disappears. The last box is inhabited by worms as well, but far less, than what I would like. And the majority still lives in their main-box (second box).

I do not know how to proceed from here.
I would like to ""clean up"" everything, but do not want to go through all the substrate to get the worms separated from the substrate.

Any advice would be appreciated.

For background I had an emergency c section at 35 weeks due to late onset gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and HELPP syndrome. All three showed up in a period of a few days. Got admitted Tuesday and had baby girl the following Monday. I did not pump much while in the hospital, I couldn‚Äôt handle the pain it was causing with the uterine contractions. Once I got home, I started to pump but not consistently and had little output. Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve been trying for a few weeks to boost my supply. I‚Äôve managed to get up to 3 ounces daily. Half of which comes from my first pump after sleeping (usually around 12-1 pm - explanation later on). Supplements and lactation treats don‚Äôt work. They either tank my supply (I‚Äôve avoided fenugreek, so it‚Äôs not that) and/or cause horrible gas in my baby. I am on reglan currently for a 21 day sprint. I started a little over a week ago. The past week or two, I‚Äôve gotten serious about pumping more consistently to where I‚Äôm now pumping 7-8 times daily. I do quite a few things daily: I drink plenty of water, drink one Gatorade zero, drink oatmilk in a single cup of coffee daily, eat protein, and have one bowl of oatmeal (I make 2 packs usually). I was getting 4-6 hours of sleep, so while I‚Äôm not really well rested I‚Äôm not totally drained from lack of sleep. The main change I am about to work on is consistency and frequency of pumping. My husband and I do shifts so I have night shift and I stay up during the night and sleep in the morning when my husband takes over.  I was pumping until 4 am and then would take a break normally from after the 4 am pump until 12 pm. Today for the first time, I did an 8 am pump and my supply today was higher. I am going to work on starting to include that pump as well as consistent every two hour pumps (except 6 am and 10 am) to get 10 pumps a day. Besides that, any recommendations?? I am desperate, I know supply stabilizes around 3 months which is also when I go back to work and will have to reduce my # of pumps. I basically have 5 weeks to maximize and get to the highest that I can. I‚Äôm not trying to get to just enough or over supply, but I‚Äôd like to get above 3 ounces in a day and I haven‚Äôt lost hope yet.

1obcego,https://v.redd.it/fpunuvt5i7wf1,The Willow Hill scene is a masterclass in Freudian Slips,"I like how Jenna interpreted the scene, Wednesday was trying to put this romance behind her and show Tyler that she is above it, that she is unaffected but her actions keep betraying.
When he says ‚Äú the only person lying to themselves is you Wednesday‚Äù Wednesday doesn‚Äôt say any of her smart quips, she just glosses over it completely and insults his looks which is funny cause she isn‚Äôt vain and in season 1 she walked in the snow to KISS HIM, drink his coffee and in season 2 she filled the paper work so perfectly she got complimented on it, all in order to get her visitation rights approved by the court weeks in advance!!
To me their relationship is definitely a very important aspect of Wednesday‚Äôs character and her black/white view, her views on change. No other character challenges those specific views she has as everyone else in her life is purely white or black ( this might change with Enid in her werewolf form).
Tyler is grey by nature, hydes are loyal to their masters. His mere existence challenges any preconceived notions she has on people, their ability to change/evolve and love in general, all things she was opposed to in season 1 but is now for him she is open to consider them, it‚Äôs why she frees him at the end of season 2 instead of jailing him like in season 1. 
She started season 1 saying to morticia she will never fall in love and she did. She started season 2 telling Donovan who said that Laurel made Tyler a monster by stating firmly that he is one and people don‚Äôt change because if she allowed herself to entertain any other idea then she can‚Äôt be above it like she claims she is, then she ends the season freeing him and wonders about what it could mean.

This is going to be a multi season long arc and I‚Äôm seated for season 3!! I really hope we get more news soon.

Basically, take 0.3mg of melatonin about 5hours before bed. 

https://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2018/03/enter-sandman-the-truth-about-melatonin

I can easily get knocked off past 11PM and naturally wake up around 7AM feeling rested nowadays.

No more tossing around in bed for 5hours !

I can‚Äôt imagine myself staying awake past 1AM anymore, and I‚Äôm not even taking melatonin except for the first few days. 

I used to strongly believe I could only be able to fall sleep past 2 to 3AM. It‚Äôs crazy. I often ended up skipping sleep just so I can sleep better next day. 

___________________________________

The actual step I took is like the following:

Day1 

1. Skipped sleep, took a cup of coffee to stay functional during the day.

2. Took melatonin at 5PM

3. Cut off blue light 2 hours before sleep

4. Did some relaxation method and waited until feeling sleepy, then went to bed

5. Couldn‚Äôt sleep for hours like usual despite the exhaustion and I was like fuck this article 


Day 2

1. Forcefully woke up at 7AM with alarm feeling like shit.

2. Took a coffee to stay functional during the day

3. Took melatonin at 5PM

4. Cut off blue light 2 hours before sleep

5. Did some relaxation method and waited until feeling sleepy, then went to bed

6. Slept earlier 


Day 3

1. Forcefully woke up at 7AM with alarm feeling like shit.

2. Took coffee to stay functional during the day

3. Took melatonin at 5PM

4. Cut off blue light 2 hours before sleep

5. Did some relaxation method and waited until feeling sleepy, then went to bed

6. Slept much earlier than usual 

Day 4 ~

1. Naturally woke up around 7AM feeling rested

2. Not even cutting off blue light strictly before bed

3. Feeling sleepy without even trying anything 

4. Slept well

Idk what to say about it.,"We were classmates in college and even had a friend group. We would talk after graduation and sometimes play DOTA 2 together. DOTA 2 stopped but he would invite me to his birthday party EVERY YEAR. I would too well sometimes. The reason I would not invite him is because I would alternate between high school and college friends. Then however on 2024, he stopped. He did not choose high school classmates. He chose to invite the college people and I saw my instagram stories, that everyone was there except me. I was heartbroken and angry he would so that. Instead of confronting him, I contemplated for a day then moved on.

Last week we bumped into each other in a coffee shop. He saw me. I was waiting in line and minding my own business then he went to me and said Hi. I did too. He asked how I was and I replied politely and told him I came from an interview etc etc. Then he asked if I want to sit with him. Instead of being angry I decided to forget about it and sit with him. We talked and talked and he told me it was good to see me again. He then asked why I stopped talking to him. Like I just stopped out of the blue. I told him in a polite way that since he and the group had their parties and did not invite me, I thought they don‚Äôt want to be friends with me. He apologized formhow I felt. He then gave me the reason why I was forgotten. It turns out that the two members of the friend group who lived near me moved nearer to the other members of the group (due to those two guys‚Äô jobs). So everyone but me is living in one area. They see each other since they are so near and since Im far I wasnt included. That‚Äôs the reason. I told him I understand now and it‚Äôs okay. He then told me he has to leave because he has dinner with a high school friend. 

Then today he asked me if I want to hang out with him and the other people of the group this friday night and I can even sleep in his place if we end late. He assured me that they do miss me. He said it‚Äôs gonna be fun.

The invitation does sound nice but I just feel awkward. Like they suddenly want to be with me now? One small bump in and Im now part of the friend group?

1obbzf9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obbzf9,The Dell RX 6500 (non-XT) GPU almost fits the M720Q perfectly while keeping the internal Wi-Fi antenna in place,"I scored a deal on this M720Q plus a parts one to tinker with a while back, and I found that the Dell RX 6500 (non-XT, yes you read that right) 4GB GDDR6 has a shorter board than most single-slot low-profile GPUs, allowing the internal Wi-Fi antenna bracket to stay in place \*almost\* untouched!

I actually ended up having to file off around 1 mm from the antenna bracket to make it flush with the GPU, so it was almost a perfect fit. Which is great because now I don't have to bother with the external antenna to keep Bluetooth working.

About the RX 6500 non-XT -- this GPU is an oddball OEM card exclusive to Dell. You can very rarely find it for sale, and never brand new. It's actually an RX 6500M mobile chip repurposed, and the official mainline AMD drivers recognize it as such.

It's supposed to perform slightly better than the RX 6400, but on the M720Q tiny it performs just like the RX 6400 and appears to be limited by the board to drawing up to 40W only instead of the 50W it's rated for - even when using a 35W CPU and a 170W PSU.

If you're planning on buying one for yourself, be aware that it suffers from the exact same downsides as the RX 6400 - the PCIe 3.0 x4 bottleneck and lack of hardware video encoders. but I believe that at the moment it only loses to the Yeston 3050 and the RX 7400 (MIA)


My GPU baffle was cut out of a cheap plastic DVD case instead of being 3D-printed, and I think it turned out pretty ok (needs some extra filing tho). The CPU is an i7 8700T, and the parts device donated its top lid for a violent vent-opening operation! also there's a bit of kapton tape over the IO to prevent the GPU from shorting on the metal parts.

The BIOS was modded to have Resizable BAR enabled using [ReBarUEFI](https://github.com/xCuri0/ReBarUEFI) which resulted in a beautiful 0% increase in performance! - probably again limited by the PCIe bandwidth bottleneck.


Overall, a great little machine with a super clever design by Lenovo!\
Even with the bottleneck, it manages to run all the games I care about and works pretty smoothly as a mini workstation for a game I'm developing in Godot - All while sipping about 1/3 of the power of my full-tower RX 6800XT/R5 5600G workstation!

First I am going to explain the layout of my friend‚Äôs home, who I am going to call Sarah. When you first walk in the door, they have a pretty large living room, and directly across from the front door, is a doorway to the kitchen. At the end of the living room to your right (next to the kitchen doorway) is a long hallway with a bathroom on the left, and three bedrooms on the right. A lot of family members lived there at the time so Sarah‚Äôs parents stayed in a garage turned bedroom at the very end of their kitchen, a few steps down. 

It was around 2 am and I had been staying with Sarah for about a week. We were watching a movie in the living room that we weren‚Äôt really paying attention to, mostly just talking and getting on our phones. Their tv was directly in front of the couch, and the hallway to the bedrooms was on the left of the tv, making it to where you could see straight down it while watching a movie. 

At one point, I get up to go make some noodles in the kitchen and come back a few minutes later and sit my bowl on their coffee table in front of the couch. I was blocking the tv while bent over to stir my noodles before I sat down. Suddenly, I feel paralyzed. The only way I could describe how I felt was static. It felt like everything around me was buzzing. I‚Äôm still bent over my bowl and stirring but I felt so terrified I couldn‚Äôt move anything else. I then felt a sensation on my right side as if someone brushed against me very slowly. I move my eyes to my right and I see a dark shadow pass me and slowly turn the corner into the hallway. I vividly remember how dark the shadow was because it blocked the entire tv. I stood there for a few more seconds until it was gone and I felt like I could move again. I turn to look at Sarah and the first thing she said was, ‚ÄúDid you see that too?‚Äù. We look down the hallway and saw that their linen closet door had opened, as well as a smaller closet above the linen closet that has a latch. We both sat in silence for the rest of the movie and rarely speak about it to this day. 

This story stands out to me more than my others because it is one of few that I have where someone else experienced the same thing as me. Given, I do have a history of experiencing symptoms of psychosis, but I did not have any symptoms until years after this story takes place. And the fact that Sarah saw the exact same thing as me makes me wonder. ",1,1760939069.0,Unexplained,0,1.0,False
1obbxfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obbxfd,"Congrats, You Hired the Divorce Queen‚ÄîToo Bad She's Your fianc√©'s Real Wife","I was a divorce attorney who specialized in cheating cases‚Äînever thought I‚Äôd end up being challenged by a mistress myself.  
  
  
One moment, I was reading a sweet text from my husband, Damian Blake‚Äî""How's my girl today?""  
  
  
The next, his ""fianc√©e"" just walked into my law office.  
  
  
She was all breathy excitement, playing coy:  
  
  
""I want to hire you for my fianc√©'s divorce. He claims his wife's a real classy bitch, so we gotta leave her some face.""  
  
  
I glanced down at the intake form.  
  
  
Client name: Damian Blake.  
  
  
Clipped to the paperwork was a photo‚Äîsame face I've woken up next to for nine years.  
  
  
Except right now? He felt like a complete stranger  
  
  
God, how ironic.  
  
  
Five years as a divorce lawyer. Blown up more marriages than I can count.  
  
  
Today, it was finally my turn.  
  
  
Congratulations, Damian.  
  
  
You just handed your mistress the one lawyer in New York who's going to make damn sure you regret it.  
  
  
...  
  
  
I closed the file and looked up at the woman sitting across from me.  
  
  
She wasn't stunning‚Äîpretty, maybe. Petite frame, that kind of skinny you only got when you'd never carried a child.  
  
  
Well-spoken, clearly raised right.  
  
  
But there was a naive purity that hinted at her sheltered life.  
  
  
When she mentioned her upcoming ""promotion,"" there's smug satisfaction in her eyes‚Äîmixed with just a hint of nerves.  
  
  
""Ms. Monroe, so... what do you think we should do?""  
  
  
""My fianc√© wants his wife to step aside quietly. You know, for old times' sake. He doesn‚Äôt want drama.""  
  
  
She said it softly, a shy little smile playing on her lips.  
  
  
If I wasn't sure she had no clue who I am, I'd have sworn she was taunting me.  
  
  
I curved my lips into my best professional smile.  
  
  
""Ms. Rhodes, how long have you two been together?""  
  
  
She blinked, caught off guard.  
  
  
""Sorry?""  
  
  
I slowed down, enunciating each word clearly.  
  
  
""Before I can give you legal advice, I need to know every detail about your relationship.""  
  
  
""Oh! Right."" She nodded, her voice going all soft and dreamy.  
  
  
But with every word she said, my smile got colder.  
  
  
""We've been together for two years. Met at a charity gala.""  
  
  
""Someone in his family had just been diagnosed with something serious. He was devastated. Alone on the terrace. I happened to walk by, and we just... talked for a while...""  
  
  
A faint blush crept across her cheeks.  
  
  
""We clicked right away. Less than a month later, we were official.""  
  
  
Listening to her sweet little love story, my chest tightened like a fist is squeezing my heart.  
  
  
""You met him two years ago today?""  
  
  
""Wait‚Äîhow did you know that?"" Her eyes went wide with surprise.  
  
  
I let a small smile tug at my lips, my lashes hiding the ice in my gaze.  
  
  
Of course I knew.  
  
  
Because two years ago today, my father had a massive heart attack. He died in the ER at New York-Presbyterian.  
  
  
Around the time they were ""meeting,"" I was on my knees outside the emergency room.  
  
  
Falling apart. Screaming until my voice gave out.  
  
  
The old wound ripped open fresh, slicing through me over and over.  
  
  
I took a silent breath and moved on to my next question.  
  
  
""You know he has a four-year-old son? He just started preschool.""  
  
  
""Oh yeah,"" that timid look vanished instantly, replaced with total confidence.  
  
  
""He promised once we're married, I'll be Noah's mom. Kids don't remember anything anyway. Whoever loves them is their real parent.""  
  
  
She looked at me, seeking validation.  
  
  
""Don't you think so, Ms. Monroe?""  
  
  
My knuckles went white. My face stayed calm.  
  
  
""Sure. You're absolutely right.""  
  
  
Too bad you'll never get the chance.  
  
  
She relaxed completely now, her guard down. She kept talking.  
  
  
Her tone actually got a little cheerful:  
  
  
""He even showed me pictures of his wife. She's got this C-section scar on her stomach‚Äîsuper deep and ugly.""  
  
  
""He said it grossed him out every time he saw it.""  
  
  
She let out a light laugh.  
  
  
""Ms. Monroe, don't you think that woman's pathetic? Like, why would she hold on this tight? God, how desperate can you be?""  
  
  
I laughed too. My eyes were frozen solid.  
  
  
""Ever consider the possibility that his wife has NO IDEA your affair?""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""No way!""  
  
  
Tiffany's voice was razor-sharp, absolute.  
  
  
""Damian can‚Äôt even stand to touch her. You'd have to be brain-dead not to notice. With me? He's all fire and hunger. But at home with that plain Jane? Says he's suffocating.""  
  
  
""Ms. Monroe, seriously‚Äîif you went two years without sex, wouldn't you find that weird?""  
  
  
""I would.""  
  
  
My answer came fast, but my eyes were locked on the Cartier wedding band on my ring finger.  
  
  
Damian and I came from completely different worlds.  
  
  
But we went from high school sweethearts to husband and wife. Nine years total.  
  
  
When I got pneumonia, he drove through a blizzard‚Äîthree hundred miles‚Äîmiddle of the night. Just to bring me medicine.  
  
  
When I was upset, he'd scour the whole Manhattan for that one bakery I loved.  
  
  
When I was pregnant, when I gave birth‚Äîhe never missed a single prenatal check-up.  
  
  
Every time he came home, he'd hug me and Noah first, telling us we were the best part of his life.  
  
  
Even when we stopped sharing a bed two years ago, he'd explained it so gently.  
  
  
""Babe, having Noah wrecked your body. I can't let you go through that again.""  
  
  
I thought that after the passion faded, this was what marriage became‚Äîgentle, steady affection.  
  
  
Never occurred to me he was just getting his satisfaction elsewhere.  
  
  
Ice crawled through my veins, straight into my chest. I pushed out my last question.  
  
  
""So you just want HER to file for divorce? That's it?""  
  
  
""No,"" she shook her head hard.  
  
  
""The most important thing is‚Äîhis wife can‚Äôt find out he cheated. Yeah, she helped Damian rise, but his success was ALL his own now. If she finds out, she'll destroy him!""  
  
  
""Ms. Monroe, you're the best divorce attorney in New York. Our future's in your hands.""  
  
  
I smiled and nodded.  
  
  
""Don't worry.""  
  
  
The second she left, I called my partner Logan Reid.  
  
  
""Logan. I need our top PI and forensic accountant. Now! I want every financial transaction and travel record Damian's made in the last two years.""  
  
  
""And tell my uncle‚Äîthat fund Damian runs? Time to pull our family's investment out.""  
  
  
""I want to see if he can stay afloat without me.""  
  
  
Logan was my golden partner for a reason‚Äîhis efficiency was unmatched.  
  
  
Within hours, an encrypted 256GB hard drive sat on my desk.  
  
  
""Everything you asked for. It's all in there.""  
  
  
I plugged it in. Clicked open.  
  
  
First video: on a private yacht.  
  
  
Damian in a white linen shirt, looking gentleman as he clasped a Graff diamond necklace around Tiffany's neck.  
  
  
Last month on my birthday, Damian said he had an emergency meeting at work. When he got home, all he brought was a wilted carnation he'd bought off the street.  
  
  
Second video: department store security cam.  
  
  
Damian had his arm around Tiffany's waist as they browsed through luxury boutiques.  
  
  
Clothes, handbags, shoes‚Äîshopping bags piled up at Tiffany's feet like a small mountain. The intimacy between them practically leaked through the screen.  
  
  
At checkout, the associate threw in a music box‚Äîfree gift. He ended up giving it to Noah and told him 'Daddy picked it out special'.  
  
  
I closed the file without expression and opened the next folder.  
  
  
Damian's offshore account showed multiple large transfers labeled as ""investment consulting fees""‚Äîall ending up in an account ending in 3308.  
  
  
Account holder: Tiffany Rhodes.  
  
  
Such a sloppy attempt at asset concealment. Did he really think I'd never find out?  
  
  
The last file made my fingertips go ice-cold.  
  
  
Chat logs from Noah's preschool teacher.  
  
  
Tiffany had been posing as ""Noah's aunt,"" constantly asking about his daily routine. She'd even already RSVP'd to next week's parent day!  
  
  
My hand clenched around the mouse.  
  
  
I couldn't accept it. Damian's betrayal had already crept into our son's life.  
  
  
When Noah was born, Damian had held that tiny life in his clumsy arms and promised he'd cherish him forever.  
  
  
Even just now, when Tiffany said she wanted custody, I'd held onto a sliver of hope.  
  
  
At least Damian loved our son.  
  
  
Even if we divorced, at least he wouldn't hurt him.  
  
  
I was wrong.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
A gaping hole tore open in my chest, icy wind howling through.  
  
  
I couldn't take it anymore. I grabbed my phone, ready to warn him to stay the FUCK away from my son.  
  
  
But my phone buzzed first‚Äîa message from Tiffany.  
  
  
She'd sent a photo of herself, asking for my opinion.  
  
  
""Ms. Monroe, does this outfit work? Damian's taking me and Noah to meet his parents tonight. I'm so nervous.""  
  
  
Almost immediately, Damian's message came through:  
  
  
""Babe, Mom and Dad are missing Noah. I'm taking him to the estate tonight. You've been working so hard‚ÄîI booked you a spa appointment at the Equinox Hotels. Go relax.""  
  
  
Looking at my son's innocent face in the photo, I smiled softly.  
  
  
A spa? Not nearly as entertaining as this little family dinner show.  
  
  
If they were meeting the parents, naturally the REAL wife should be there to supervise.  
  
  
I hung up and immediately drove straight to the Blake estate.  
  
  
On the way, Damian's messages kept popping up.  
  
  
""Babe, you there yet? Traffic's bad on the main road‚Äîeverything okay?""  
  
  
He was tracking my location.  
  
  
Calmly, I found a random spa photo online and sent it.  
  
  
""Just got here. Nice place.""  
  
  
Short reply. But he seemed satisfied.  
  
  
""Have fun. Love you.""  
  
  
Same old sweetness. Now it just made me sick.  
  
  
I pocketed my phone and ignored the rest.  
  
  
I parked the car and slipped in through the side entrance, sunglasses on.  
  
  
Dinner hadn't started yet, but most of the Blake relatives had already arrived.  
  
  
Damian's mother Helena was bustling between the kitchen and living room, all smiles‚Äî  
  
  
The same warm, attentive energy she'd shown me years ago.  
  
  
When I was exhausted, she'd bring soup to my office every week.  
  
  
When I was cold, she'd knit me scarves and slippers, treating me better than her own son.  
  
  
She even remembered my father's back problems and went out of her way to find an acupuncturist to help him.  
  
  
My father‚Äîwho could read anyone‚Äîhad told me:  
  
  
""The Blakes are good people. Marrying into that family, I've got no worries.""  
  
  
Now, she was the first to greet Tiffany as she walked in beside Damian.  
  
  
""You must be Tiffany! So pretty‚ÄîI can tell you'll give us lots of grandsons.""  
  
  
""Damian, don't you dare mistreat this girl.""  
  
  
Damian's dad Thomas, usually so reserved, set down his coffee and patted Damian's shoulder with satisfaction.  
  
  
""Smart choice, son. About time we had more boys in this family.""  
  
  
Suddenly, it clicked‚Äîthey were mad I only gave them ONE.  
  
  
Funny‚Äîsince Damian was the one who said no to more kids.  
  
  
Tiffany straightened proudly, her voice dripping with sweetness:  
  
  
""Don't worry, Uncle Thomas, Aunt Helena. Damian took me to get checked. The doctor said I'm very likely to have boys.""  
  
  
""Wonderful! Just wonderful!"" His parents beamed while my son stood alone in the corner, forgotten.  
  
  
Relatives crowded around, showering her with praise.  
  
  
The cousin I loaned $150K? ""Damian, you absolute legend!""  
  
  
The aunt whose kid I got into a study abroad program? Sobbing. ""Tiffany's such a sweetheart!""  
  
  
The cousin whose startup I saved with my connections? Raising his glass. ""To the happy couple!""  
  
  
Every single one of them had benefited from my help. Not one of them remembered my name now.  
  
  
The aunt wiped her tears, then excitedly grabbed my four-year-old son and shoved him toward Tiffany.  
  
  
""Go on, call her Mommy!""  
  
  
Helena immediately chimed in, forcing Noah's hand into Tiffany's.  
  
  
""Be a good boy, Noah. Say Mommy!""  
  
  
My son stumbled backward, terrified.  
  
  
""No! She's not my mommy! My mommy's name is Selena!""  
  
  
Helena's face twisted instantly. She pinched his arm hard.  
  
  
""Don't talk nonsense! This IS your new mommy!""  
  
  
Thomas glared coldly.  
  
  
""Damian, is this how you're raising your son? No manners at all!""  
  
  
Tiffany nestled into Damian's arms, pouting.  
  
  
""Damian... does Noah hate me?""  
  
  
Damian held her close, his voice soft and soothing.  
  
  
""Of course not. He's just a kid‚Äîhe doesn't know any better. Once we're married, you'll handle all his discipline. I won't interfere.""  
  
  
I stood outside the door, watching this absurd scene unfold, and finally‚ÄîI couldn't take it anymore.  
  
  
Then I pushed the door open.  
  
  
Every face in the room froze in shock as I smiled lightly.  
  
  
""Family dinner, huh? Weird‚Äîhow come nobody told me?""

1obbx8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1obbx8o/5_days_postop_vnotes_hysterectomy_my_honest/,"5 Days Post-Op (vNOTES Hysterectomy) My Honest Experience, What‚Äôs Helped, and a Few Things I Didn‚Äôt Expect üíõ","
Hey everyone! I‚Äôm 5 days post-op from a vNOTES (vaginal natural orifice) hysterectomy‚Ä¶my uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes were removed, but my ovaries were left in place. Before surgery I was so anxious reading posts about people waking up in unbearable pain, so I wanted to share my experience for anyone nervous or preparing.

Overall Experience

Honestly, it‚Äôs gone much smoother than I expected. My surgeon was able to do everything vaginally (no abdominal incisions üôå), and I woke up emotional but not in terrible pain. I‚Äôd call it a 2‚Äì3/10 right after surgery. I was able to walk the same day and go home a few hours later.

Pain since then has been manageable I‚Äôm rotating Tylenol and Ibuprofen, and used the prescribed pain med only at night for the first few days. Gabapentin didn‚Äôt do much for me, so I stopped that on Day 3.

What‚Äôs Helped the Most

Recliner sleeping - way better than bed early on! I tried my bed too soon and it pulled on everything. I woke up feeling awful. 

Heating pad ‚Äî great for neck/back, though I overheated easily (hello, hormone swings).

Zero gravity chair or porch time ..sitting outside with coffee or tea has helped me feel human again.

Walking every couple of hours‚Ä¶just short walks, even 2‚Äì5 minutes, made a big difference.

Meds on schedule ‚Äî don‚Äôt wait for pain to spike.

Miralax + Colace ‚Äî seriously, don‚Äôt skip bowel care! I started colace 2 weeks before surgery!

Small tasks like making coffee or wiping counters just enough to feel productive without overdoing it.

Things I Didn‚Äôt Expect and would love advice on: 

Sleep:I cannot sleep more than 3‚Äì4 hours at a time. Not because of pain, just restlessness and odd energy.  

Hormones:Even with ovaries intact, I‚Äôm getting hot flashes, dizziness, and that ‚Äúout of body‚Äù feeling. I‚Äôm typically a very cold person so this is new to me

Swelling: My stomach still feels bloated and weirdly heavy even though pain is low.

Walking: prior to surgery I walked 2.5-3 miles a day, I see people going long distance however I can‚Äôt go more than 500ft without a tugging sensation- how are you all building up so quick? 

Gas pain: Even though mine wasn‚Äôt laparoscopic, I still had referred pain around my ribs and shoulders.
Emotion swings: I‚Äôve felt frustrated, teary, and anxious for no clear reason

My Approach Going Forward

Even though I feel *mostly okay*, I‚Äôm realizing this is the stage where people accidentally overdo it. I pushed a little yesterday and paid for it today with spotting and pressure. So my goal now is:

> No pushing for the first 3 weeks if I can help it. Slow, steady healing wins.

If you‚Äôre heading into surgery please know it‚Äôs not all horror stories. For me, it‚Äôs been challenging but completely manageable, and I‚Äôm grateful for modern medicine and an incredible care team. üíõ

Happy to answer questions if anyone wants to know about my experience

1obbx76,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1obbx76/try_it/,Try it!,"Yesterday i was at the park and saw a girl who I thought was cute. A dunk guy and his dog were sitting near here so i decided it would be a good idea to go over to the drunk guy and ask to pet his dog that way she would be aware of my presence. After letting the dog I decided to sit close to where she was sitting ( obviously not invading her private space but close to where we could have a chat ). I decided to get a book out of my backpack that Ive been reading as I saw that she was also reading a book herself. I done this because well first of to read my book but to also show her that we have a common hobby. At this point I still haven‚Äôt spoken a word to her or even caught her eye. Just simply presenting my presence. Anyway the drunk man with the dog said something funny that made us both laugh and it was at that moment we both commented on it to each other and the conversation began between us. 

Long story short we both had similar interests like reading, psychology, working out, etc.. but here‚Äôs the amazing part which ‚Äúmost‚Äù girls rarely do in today‚Äôs world which is she asked me for my instagram. Now that can be quite normal and common but what isn‚Äôt common is that she was actually the first one to message me after I had left to tell me that she really enjoyed talking with me and that she liked the way I think and asked if I would be open to meet again at some point. 

This caught me off guard because normally it‚Äôs the guy that makes the first move because typically women like the chase and it‚Äôs normally a social norm for the man to make the first move anyway. Now I‚Äôm no good looking guy who‚Äôs 6‚Äô4 with a chiseled jaw, amazing thick hair and a stylish outfit. So I knew it wasn‚Äôt simply looks that got her interest but that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm here to talk about. My point is girls you‚Äôd would be so surprised by how much success you would have in the dating world if you made the first move. 

Here why: most guys would love to make the first move and ask for your contacts or message you for a date but shy away from the action of doing it because there‚Äôs a lot of competition in today‚Äôs world especially on dating apps. There‚Äôs more guys on the apps than there are girls meaning the likelihood of being picked by a girl and her not choosing someone else or not speaking to someone else at the same time is very unlikely plus over the year especially 5-10 years ago there was a period of time where guys would be called creeps if they approached a girl and some of that stereotype still lingers today in men‚Äôs minds so they decide not to approach at all. 

Wether your a guy or a girl, approaching someone is a bit scary but the truth is statistically in a heterosexual situation girls will have a lot more success in getting a date with a guy than a guy trying to get a date with a girl. A girl approaching a guy is something a lot of guys find really attractive and nice because they‚Äôve been so used to it being the other way round and failing. So girls if there‚Äôs someone out there you would like to get to know whether it‚Äôs a stranger, an acquaintance, a work colleague or your 2nd cousin ( if you‚Äôre from certain parts of America. Iykyk ) then ask them for they socials and be the first to message them and I promise you you will have more luck than you‚Äôd possibly could have thought. Maybe after a date with the other person he wasn‚Äôt the  right fit for you and that‚Äôs completely cool but don‚Äôt let that stop you again in the future because like I said earlier women are more likely to get accepted by men than men being accepted by women when it comes to asking out for the date. 

So girls next time be the ones to approach instead for a change. I‚Äôm so glad that the girl made the first move because as a guy I felt like she generally was interested in me whereas sometimes when it‚Äôs the other way round it can feel like the girl just wants to go on a date so that they can get a free meal or a coffee out of it ( which there are some girls who do that unfortunately) 

And to the guys reading this. I know how rare it is üòÇ I‚Äôm shocked myself still.

I‚Äôm launching a small specialty coffee roasting business called Mounty Coffee Roastery, based in Georgia (the country). We‚Äôve just finished setting up our roastery and are now looking to source our first batch of green beans.

We‚Äôre interested in Arabica Grade A, size 17+ washed beans from Africa ‚Äî particularly Ethiopia, Kenya, or Tanzania ‚Äî with delivery to Poti Port, Georgia (CIF).

Since we‚Äôre just starting out, we‚Äôre looking for around 500 kg to begin with, not full container loads. The challenge has been finding reliable African exporters or cooperatives willing to work with small-batch roasters at a fair price.

If anyone here has experience or connections with trusted African coffee producers, exporters, or brokers who support smaller orders, I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice or recommendations.

Also, any guidance on expected CIF pricing or what to watch out for when dealing with new suppliers would be super helpful.

* Great for testing a small brand or influencer collab.

**Suplify Pros:**

* Super easy to start - no inventory, low risk, simple setup.

1obbq19,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1obbq19/how_to_change_your_snapchat_location/,How To Change Your Snapchat Location,"Imagine this: You're scrolling through Snapchat when you notice a friend's Bitmoji is constantly updating their exact location on Snap Map‚Äîtheir home address, their gym, their favorite coffee shop. Every movement tracked and visible to hundreds of ""friends,"" including people they haven't spoken to in years.

This isn't a hypothetical scenario. With over **250 million monthly users** on Snap Map, location sharing has become one of Snapchat's most popular‚Äîand potentially dangerous‚Äîfeatures. While location-based filters and friend tracking can be fun, they also create serious privacy and security risks, from stalking and harassment to unwanted data collection.

The good news? You have more control over your Snapchat location than you might think. This comprehensive guide will show you exactly how to protect your privacy, manage your location settings, and understand what's really happening with your data.

# Understanding Snapchat's Location Tracking Features

Before we dive into protection methods, you need to understand how Snapchat tracks and uses your location data.

# Snap Map: Your Real-Time Location Broadcast

Snap Map is Snapchat's interactive map feature that displays your location to selected friends. When enabled, it shows:

* Your **exact GPS coordinates** updated every few minutes
* Your Bitmoji avatar on a detailed street map
* What you're doing (driving, listening to music, etc.)
* Public Snaps from your location

**The key technical detail:** Snapchat uses your device's **GPS hardware signals**, not just your IP address. This distinction is crucial for understanding which privacy methods actually work.

# Live Location Sharing

In November 2024, Snapchat expanded its Family Center features with enhanced Live Location capabilities. This allows:

* **Continuous real-time tracking** for 15 minutes to 8 hours
* Parents to request their teen's location
* Travel notifications when users leave designated areas
* Visibility into who your contacts are sharing locations with

While designed for safety, these features can be misused if not properly managed.

# Geofilters and Location Data Collection

Snapchat also uses your location for:

* **Exclusive location-based filters** tied to specific places
* Personalized content and advertisements
* Analytics and platform improvements

According to Snapchat's privacy policy, they store GPS locations to ""help improve the Map and other features"" and show you ""more relevant Search content.""

# The Real Security Risks of Location Sharing

Location tracking on social media isn't just a privacy concern‚Äîit's a genuine security threat. Understanding these risks is the first step toward protecting yourself.

# Stalking and Harassment

Precise location data can enable dangerous behavior. Security experts have documented cases where Snap Map facilitated:

* **Ex-partners tracking victims** to homes, workplaces, or schools
* Strangers learning daily routines and predictable patterns
* Cyberbullies coordinating real-world confrontations

As cybersecurity expert Charles Tendell told ABC News: ""It is very easy to accidentally share everything that you've got with more people than you need to, and that's the scariest portion.""

# Historical Privacy Violations

Snapchat hasn't always been transparent about location tracking. In 2014, the Federal Trade Commission filed complaints against Snapchat for:

* **Transmitting WiFi and cell-based location data** from Android devices despite claiming they didn't track location
* Collecting contact information without user consent
* Misrepresenting content deletion and screenshot notifications
* Inadequate security allowing 4.6 million usernames and phone numbers to be exposed

While Snapchat has since improved its practices, these violations remind us that **vigilance is essential**.

# Third-Party Data Sharing and Targeting

Snapchat collects location data for more than just maps. According to their privacy policy, they may share your information with:

* Service providers and business partners
* Advertisers for targeted campaigns
* Analytics companies tracking user behavior
* Integrated third-party apps

Even if you trust Snapchat, **every additional party with access to your data increases your risk exposure**.

# Method 1: Use Ghost Mode and Built-In Privacy Controls (Primary Recommendation)

The most effective and immediate way to protect your location on Snapchat is through the app's built-in privacy settings. **This should be your first step**, regardless of whether you use additional protection methods.

# How to Enable Ghost Mode

Ghost Mode is Snapchat's **default privacy setting** that hides your location from everyone. Here's how to verify it's enabled:

1. Open Snapchat and tap your **profile icon** in the top-left corner
2. Tap the **settings gear** icon in the top-right
3. Scroll down to ""Privacy Control"" and select **""See My Location""**
4. Toggle **""Ghost Mode""** on (it should show green)
5. When prompted, select **""Until turned off""** for continuous privacy

**What Ghost Mode actually does:**

* Hides your location from all friends on Snap Map
* Prevents your Bitmoji from appearing on others' maps
* Still allows you to view the map and see public Snaps
* Does **not** affect other location-based features like Geofilters

# Selective Location Sharing Options

If you want some friends to see your location while maintaining privacy from others, Snapchat offers granular controls:

* **""My Friends""** ‚Äì Share with everyone on your friend list
* **""My Friends, Except...""** ‚Äì Share with everyone except specific people
* **""Only These Friends...""** ‚Äì Share only with selected individuals

**Security tip:** The more selective you are, the safer you'll be. Consider sharing your location only during specific activities (meeting up with friends) rather than keeping it always on.

# Additional Privacy Settings to Review

Beyond Ghost Mode, strengthen your Snapchat privacy by adjusting these settings:

**Contact Me:**

* Set to ""My Friends"" to prevent strangers from messaging you
* Disable ""Add Nearby"" to prevent people near you from finding your account

**View My Story:**

* Set to ""My Friends"" or create a custom list
* Avoid ""Everyone"" which makes your Stories public

**See My Location:**

* Review the ""Hide My Live Location"" toggle
* Check which friends currently have access to your location

# Method 2: Add VPN Protection for Enhanced Privacy

While Ghost Mode handles your location visibility to other users, a VPN adds critical privacy protection that Snapchat's settings alone cannot provide.

# What a VPN Actually Does for Snapchat

Let's be crystal clear about an important technical distinction: **A VPN alone will not change your GPS location on Snapchat**. Here's why:

Snapchat uses your device's **hardware GPS signals** to determine your location for features like Snap Map and Geofilters. A VPN changes your **IP address** (which websites and apps use to estimate your location), but it doesn't affect the GPS hardware signals your phone sends directly to apps.

However, VPNs provide essential privacy benefits:

* **Hides your IP address** from Snapchat and other online services
* **Encrypts your internet traffic**, preventing ISPs, network administrators, and potential attackers from seeing your Snapchat activity
* **Blocks tracking** from advertisers and data brokers who build profiles based on your IP location
* **Protects on public WiFi**, securing your data from network-based attacks
* **Prevents ISP throttling** of social media traffic

# Why NordVPN is Ideal for Snapchat Privacy

When choosing a VPN for enhanced Snapchat security, you need a provider that balances robust protection with fast performance. **NordVPN** stands out as the top choice for several reasons:

**Industry-Leading Security Features:**

* **AES-256-GCM encryption** ‚Äì Military-grade protection for your data
* **Independently audited no-logs policy** ‚Äì Verified by Deloitte in 2025, ensuring your activity isn't recorded
* **Threat Protection Pro** ‚Äì Updated in 2025 to block malware, trackers, and intrusive ads **even when the VPN is disconnected**
* **Automatic kill switch** ‚Äì Instantly blocks your internet if the VPN connection drops, preventing data leaks

**Optimized Performance:**

* **7,400+ servers in 118 countries** ‚Äì Ensures fast connections wherever you are
* **NordLynx protocol** ‚Äì Proprietary technology delivering speeds that rival non-VPN connections
* **Split tunneling** ‚Äì Route Snapchat through the VPN while keeping other apps on your regular connection for maximum flexibility

**Privacy-First Infrastructure:**

* Headquartered in **Panama** ‚Äì Outside 5/9/14 Eyes surveillance alliances
* **RAM-only servers** ‚Äì All data wiped with every reboot, physically impossible to store logs
* **Double VPN and Onion Over VPN** ‚Äì Available for users needing maximum anonymity

**Practical Advantages:**

* **Up to 10 simultaneous connections** ‚Äì Protect all your devices
* **24/7 support** ‚Äì Real humans ready to help, not chatbots
* **30-day money-back guarantee** ‚Äì Try it risk-free

For Snapchat users specifically, NordVPN's combination of robust encryption, ad blocking through Threat Protection Pro, and verified privacy makes it the ideal choice for adding a security layer to your social media use.

# How to Set Up NordVPN for Snapchat

1. **Subscribe to NordVPN** and download the app for your device
2. **Launch the app** and sign in with your credentials
3. **Connect to a server** (NordVPN's Quick Connect finds the fastest option)
4. **Enable Threat Protection Pro** in settings for ad and tracker blocking
5. **Open Snapchat** and use normally ‚Äì your traffic is now encrypted and your IP is masked

Remember: The VPN protects your IP address and encrypts your traffic, but your **GPS location remains unchanged**. For location privacy on Snapchat itself, combine the VPN with Ghost Mode.

# Method 3: GPS Spoofing (Advanced Users Only)

If you need to actually change your GPS location on Snapchat‚Äînot just hide it‚Äîyou'll need GPS spoofing tools. However, this method comes with significant caveats.

# Important Warnings

**Terms of Service:** Using GPS spoofing to fake your location on Snapchat **violates their Terms of Service**. While enforcement is inconsistent, your account could potentially be restricted or banned.

**Limited Availability:** GPS spoofing on iOS is extremely difficult and typically requires jailbreaking your device, which creates serious security vulnerabilities. It's primarily feasible on Android devices.

**Appropriate vs. Inappropriate Uses:**

‚úÖ **Appropriate:**

* Protecting privacy from an abusive ex-partner
* Testing location-based features as a developer
* Accessing region-specific filters while traveling (personal use)

‚ùå **Inappropriate:**

* Deceiving friends about your whereabouts
* Stalking or monitoring others
* Circumventing legitimate restrictions
* Any malicious or harmful purposes

# GPS Spoofing on Android

Some VPN providers, including Surfshark, offer GPS override features on Android:

1. Subscribe to a VPN with GPS spoofing (Surfshark is the most prominent)
2. Install the VPN app on your Android device
3. Navigate to **Advanced Settings** and enable **""Override GPS location""**
4. Follow the VPN's specific instructions for permissions
5. Select your desired location in the VPN app
6. Open Snapchat ‚Äì your GPS location should now match your VPN selection

**Technical note:** This works because Android allows apps to provide mock location data to the system. iOS has more restrictive security that prevents this functionality.

# Additional Privacy Best Practices for Snapchat

Beyond location control, strengthen your overall Snapchat security with these practices:

# Manage Advertising and Data Collection

1. Go to **Settings > Ad Preferences**
2. Toggle off **all three options:**
   * Audience-Based
   * Activity-Based
   * Third-Party Ad Networks
3. This limits (but doesn't eliminate) targeted advertising based on your activity

# Review App Permissions Regularly

Check what permissions Snapchat has on your device:

* **Location** ‚Äì Set to ""While Using App"" or ""Never"" rather than ""Always""
* **Camera and Microphone** ‚Äì Required for core functionality, but be aware they're accessible
* **Contacts** ‚Äì Disable if you don't want Snapchat scanning your address book
* **Photos** ‚Äì Limit to ""Selected Photos"" on iOS if available

# Audit Your Friend List

Your privacy settings only protect you from people on your friend list. Regularly review:

* Remove connections you don't actually know in person
* Delete contacts from old relationships or situations
* Be selective about accepting new friend requests
* Consider keeping a smaller, more trusted network

# Use Strong Authentication

* Enable **two-factor authentication** in Snapchat settings
* Use a **strong, unique password** (password managers like NordPass can help)
* Be skeptical of **login requests** or suspicious messages from ""Snapchat""

# The Layered Security Approach

The most effective privacy strategy combines multiple protection layers:

1. **Foundation: Ghost Mode** ‚Äì Your primary defense against location exposure
2. **Enhanced Layer: VPN Protection** ‚Äì Adds IP privacy, encryption, and tracker blocking
3. **Behavioral Layer: Smart Usage** ‚Äì Selective sharing, regular audits, strong authentication

**No single method provides perfect security**, but this multi-layered approach significantly reduces your risk profile.

# Conclusion: Taking Control of Your Snapchat Privacy

Snapchat's location features don't have to compromise your safety. By understanding how location tracking actually works, implementing Ghost Mode, considering VPN protection, and following security best practices, you can enjoy the platform's benefits while maintaining control over your personal information.

**Your action plan:**

1. **Right now:** Enable Ghost Mode and review your location sharing settings
2. **This week:** Audit your privacy settings, friend list, and app permissions
3. **For ongoing protection:** Consider a trusted VPN like NordVPN to encrypt your traffic and block trackers

Remember: **Privacy is not paranoia**‚Äîit's a fundamental right. In an era where location data enables everything from targeted advertising to real-world stalking, protecting your digital footprint isn't optional.

Take control of your Snapchat location today. Your future self will thank you.

At first glance, programmers look like digital wizards, conjuring worlds from glowing screens. But what they actually know is stranger ‚Äî and more human ‚Äî than you might expect.

**1. Machines speak in riddles.**  
Programmers learn to speak the machine‚Äôs language ‚Äî Python, C++, Java. Where you might argue with Siri, they can bend silicon into logic. But the price of fluency is hours lost hunting one missing semicolon, like a monk searching for a syllable in scripture.

**2. Debugging is confession.**  
They know that 90% of coding is repentance ‚Äî admitting the system broke because *you* misunderstood it. Sometimes all it takes is explaining your problem to a rubber duck, because the ritual of speaking clears the fog.

**3. Code is fragile divinity.**  
Programmers understand that computers are both smarter and dumber than humans. They can calculate faster than thought, but trip over a comma. Apps that look ‚Äúsimple‚Äù to you are thousands of lines, stitched together like veins ‚Äî one bad stitch, the whole heart stutters.

**4. Automation is survival.**  
You click ‚Äúrename‚Äù on 1,000 files one by one; a programmer writes a 10-line script and lets it sing. They don‚Äôt just endure repetition; they transmute it into elegance.

**5. Culture is the glue.**  
From ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù to Stack Overflow memes, from 404 jokes to ASCII art, programmers live in a culture of inside jokes and sacred phrases. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature‚Äù isn‚Äôt denial ‚Äî it‚Äôs gallows humor that keeps them sane.

**6. Code is poetry, and coffee is blood.**  
The good ones believe this: code should be beautiful, not just functional. It should *read*. And yes, their bloodstream is 30% caffeine, but that‚Äôs just the tax of living in two worlds at once ‚Äî human and machine.

**Final glitch.**  
Programmers don‚Äôt just build apps; they inhabit a strange middle kingdom where humor, logic, and ritual keep the chaos in check. They know what you don‚Äôt: that the digital world isn‚Äôt run by perfect machines, but by imperfect humans who learned to make the chaos sing.",3,1760937510.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

For many of us, the day doesn‚Äôt start without a cup of hot, aromatic coffee. But if you‚Äôve ever wondered whether your daily brew helps or harms your heart, you‚Äôre not alone. Let‚Äôs explore what science says about coffee and heart disease ‚Äî in simple, easy-to-understand language.

# Section 1: The Daily Coffee Habit ‚Äì A Common Story

Every morning in New York, Emma, a 42-year-old nurse, starts her day with a large cup of black coffee. For her, it‚Äôs not just a drink ‚Äî it‚Äôs a moment of calm before the rush of the hospital.  
But recently, after reading headlines about caffeine and heart health, she began to worry: *‚ÄúAm I putting my heart at risk?‚Äù*

This is a common concern for many people. Coffee is loved by millions, but it‚Äôs often surrounded by myths. Let‚Äôs uncover the truth with scientific evidence, expert opinions, and real-world data.

# Section 2: What Science Says About Coffee and Heart Health

Over the last two decades, coffee has been studied more than almost any other beverage. Researchers have dug deep into its effects on the heart, cholesterol, and blood pressure.

# Key Findings from Research

|Study|Conducted By|Finding|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Harvard School of Public Health (2021)|Over 500,000 participants|Moderate coffee drinkers (2‚Äì3 cups per day) had a **15% lower risk** of heart disease.|
|European Society of Cardiology (2022)|450,000 adults|Coffee drinkers had **reduced risk of heart failure** compared to non-drinkers.|
|American Heart Association (AHA)|Ongoing review|Coffee consumption in moderation is **linked to longevity** and better cardiovascular function.|

These studies show that coffee is not the enemy many thought it was. In fact, when consumed wisely, it can play a role in supporting heart health.

# Section 3: Why Coffee May Be Good for the Heart

Coffee is packed with natural compounds that can protect your cardiovascular system. Let‚Äôs break them down in simple points.

# 1. Antioxidants that Fight Inflammation

Coffee is one of the biggest sources of antioxidants in the modern diet. These compounds reduce oxidative stress and inflammation ‚Äî two major causes of heart disease.

**Example:**  
Chlorogenic acid, found in coffee beans, helps protect blood vessels from damage.

# 2. Improves Blood Vessel Function

Moderate caffeine intake can help relax and expand blood vessels, improving blood circulation throughout the body. This supports better oxygen flow to the heart.

# 3. May Lower Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for heart disease. According to a 2020 Harvard study, drinking 3‚Äì4 cups of coffee daily can lower the risk of diabetes by **up to 25%**, indirectly protecting heart health.

# 4. Supports Healthy Cholesterol Balance

Regular coffee (without sugar and cream) can increase HDL ‚Äî the ‚Äúgood cholesterol‚Äù ‚Äî which helps remove excess fat and plaque from arteries.

# Section 4: When Coffee Can Hurt Your Heart

While moderate coffee consumption is beneficial, **too much caffeine can cause harm**. Here‚Äôs what to watch out for.

# 1. High Blood Pressure Spikes

Caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure, especially in people sensitive to it or those who rarely drink coffee.  
If you have hypertension, check your blood pressure regularly and limit coffee to 1‚Äì2 cups a day.

# 2. Added Sugar and Creamers

The real problem often isn‚Äôt coffee itself but what we add to it. Sugary lattes, flavored syrups, and heavy cream increase calories and fat ‚Äî which may hurt your heart in the long run.

**Better choice:** Black coffee or coffee with a splash of unsweetened milk.

# 3. Excessive Consumption

Drinking more than **5 cups a day** may lead to restlessness, insomnia, or irregular heartbeats in some people.

**Expert Advice:**  
According to Dr. Annalisa Lopez, a cardiologist from the Cleveland Clinic,

# Section 5: What Experts and Doctors Say

To understand the balance between benefits and risks, let‚Äôs hear what leading experts have to say:

**Dr. Walter Willett**, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health:

>

**Dr. Megan O‚ÄôDonnell**, British Heart Foundation:

>

# Section 6: Simple Tips for a Heart-Healthy Coffee Routine

Here are practical ways to enjoy coffee while protecting your heart:

* Limit to **2‚Äì4 cups per day**.
* Choose **black or lightly sweetened coffee**.
* Avoid sugary syrups and flavored creamers.
* Stay hydrated by drinking water alongside your coffee.
* Choose **filter coffee** ‚Äî it removes cafestol, a compound that can raise cholesterol.
* If you‚Äôre sensitive to caffeine, opt for **half-caf or decaf** options.

**Pro Tip:** Drinking your coffee after breakfast, rather than on an empty stomach, can reduce caffeine‚Äôs effect on blood pressure.

# Section 7: Real-Life Experience

Mark, a 50-year-old office worker from California, had a history of high blood pressure. He used to drink five cups of strong coffee daily. After talking with his doctor, he cut back to two cups ‚Äî one in the morning, one after lunch. Within a few months, his blood pressure stabilized.  
‚ÄúI realized it wasn‚Äôt coffee‚Äôs fault,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was how much I was drinking and what I was putting in it.‚Äù

Stories like Mark‚Äôs remind us that balance matters more than restriction.

# Section 8: The Final Verdict ‚Äì Help or Hurt?

So, does coffee help or hurt your heart?  
The answer depends on **how you drink it**.

|Factor|Effect on Heart|
|:-|:-|
|Moderate intake (2‚Äì4 cups/day)|May lower heart disease risk|
|Excessive intake (5+ cups/day)|May increase heart palpitations|
|Coffee with sugar/cream|Raises calories and fat intake|
|Black or filtered coffee|Protects heart health|

**In short:** Moderate coffee is your friend. Overconsumption or too many sugary add-ons can turn it into an enemy.

# Section 9: Final Thoughts

Coffee is not just a beverage ‚Äî it‚Äôs a daily ritual that connects people across the world. Science shows that when enjoyed wisely, it can support both your heart and overall well-being.

The next time you sip your morning cup, know that it might actually be helping your heart ‚Äî not hurting it.

# Key Takeaways

* Moderate coffee consumption supports heart health.
* Too much caffeine or sugar can harm your heart.
* Experts agree: 2‚Äì4 cups daily is generally safe.
* Choose black or filtered coffee for best benefits.
* Always listen to your body and consult your doctor if needed.",1,1760937093.0,u_johnsmithmath89,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a small victory that feels huge for me. A few months ago, I was officially told I was prediabetic (A1C: 5.8). It honestly shook me. I‚Äôd been dealing with health anxiety for a while, and hearing that number felt like a slap, like my body was telling me, ‚Äúenough.‚Äù Instead of panicking (okay, after a little panic üòÖ), I decided to actually do something. I started small and kept stacking changes until they became part of my routine.

Here‚Äôs what I did:

	‚Ä¢	Intermittent fasting - I started with 14/10 and eventually moved to 16/8. It helped me control my cravings, and I noticed my energy levels evened out big time.

	‚Ä¢	Quit the karak tea habit - for context, I live in the Abu Dhabi and was always having super sweet karak every single day for almost three years. That alone probably pushed my glucose levels up. Now it‚Äôs black coffee or green tea only.

	‚Ä¢	Walks, walks, and more walks - I committed to walking 10-15K steps daily (sometimes in the Abu Dhabi heat ü•µ). It became my therapy.

	‚Ä¢	Gym life - I got consistent again. 

	‚Ä¢	Mindful eating - I didn‚Äôt go extreme. I still enjoy food, but I swapped out processed junk and focused on balanced meals, protein, veggies, and fiber. 

	‚Ä¢	Mental reset - I brought back meditation through the Calm app (lifetime subscriber here üòÖ). It‚Äôs helped me manage stress better than anything else.

Fast forward to now, my latest test came back A1C: 5.6, back in the normal range! Conscious effort is the key.

But here‚Äôs the thing, I know this isn‚Äôt the finish line. I know it‚Äôs a lifelong commitment. I‚Äôm still working on staying consistent, fighting stress, and remembering that health is a long game.

I wanted to share a detailed outlook on the GoMining Token ($GOMINING), based on recent developments and forecasts. GoMining is an innovative ecosystem that makes Bitcoin mining more accessible by linking physical mining hardware with digital NFTs. The token acts as a central utility and governance tool, designed to be deflationary for long-term value appreciation.
First, an overview: $GOMINING allows users to purchase and upgrade digital miners, pay maintenance fees with up to 20% discounts (via token holding or locking), earn rewards through staking, and participate in governance decisions. The tokenomics model revolves around a weekly burn-and-mint cycle: All tokens spent on fees are burned, and 80-100% are reminted based on community votes. This creates a deflationary dynamic ‚Äì 6.7% of the original supply has been permanently burned, leaving a current total supply of 100 million tokens. Ôøº Ôøº
Looking ahead, things are promising. GoMining plans to enable NFT miners as collateral for DeFi loans and staking, unlocking liquidity for mining assets and integrating the token deeper into the BTCfi narrative. Ôøº Even more exciting: GoMining Cards are set to launch in summer 2025 ‚Äì cards that let you pay for everyday purchases (e.g., coffee) with $GOMINING and get hash rate as cashback. This massively expands real-world utility. Other plans include a travel agency platform for bookings with the token and an expanded marketplace for goods. The 2024 roadmap (extending into 2025) features hash rate increases to up to 10 million TH/s, partnerships with MENA governments for new data centers (e.g., 200 MW), and AI optimizations for efficiency. Ôøº Ôøº
Price predictions vary but many are bullish: CoinLore forecasts $0.5159 for 2025, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs growth and ecosystem expansion. Ôøº Others like CoinCheckup see short-term dips (to $0.02968 by November 2025), but long-term potential up to $1 in 2029. Ôøº Ôøº Recent community activity on X shows positive momentum: Users are sharing farm upgrades (e.g., to 177 TH/s), events like #EBC11, and referral programs for extra TH boosts. Ôøº Ôøº
Risks? As with any crypto token: Market volatility, regulations, and dependence on Bitcoin‚Äôs price. But with over 4,650 BTC mined and a focus on sustainability (deflationary, long-term like Bitcoin‚Äôs model), $GOMINING could become a strong player in the mining sector. What do you think? Have you invested? Let‚Äôs discuss!",1,1760936994.0,GoMiningDiscussion,0,1.0,False

I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models.

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me.

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it.

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages).

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.

Subjects I like learning about

* Mathematics¬†- I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* Programming¬†- I love participating in programming contests
* Chess¬†- I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* Reading¬†- I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction.
* Sports Trivia -¬†The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before.

1obbar7,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1obbar7/i_want_to_connect_with_more_life_long_learners/,I want to connect with more life long learners and lovers of knowledge. Is this something common to all INFPs ? I get inspired to learn something only when I find the aesthetic value to it - rather than pressure from an exam or deadline.,"# 

I¬†¬†have always been a lover of knowledge and wisdom. I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models.

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me.

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it.

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages).

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.

Subjects I like learning about

* **Mathematics**¬†\- I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* **Programming**¬†\- I love participating in programming contests
* **Chess**¬†\- I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* **Reading**¬†\- I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction.
* **Sports Trivia -**¬†The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before.

1obb35q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1obb35q/feeling_trapped/,Feeling trapped,"This is a throwaway account.

I (31f) am still living at home. I can't afford not to. I am self employed and work 80 hours a week and only make enough to just about survive. I live in a very small, very impoverished area where there are no jobs (the unemployment rate is over 50%) and my autism stops me from holding down any job where social skills are required anyway (I am very high masking but no matter what I do people always find me 'off' and end up hating me, and I simply cannot pin down what I'm doing wrong), but I was only diagnosed as an adult.

I am not allowed to leave the house alone. I know a lot of people are going to say 'their house, their rules' but I cannot even go to the shop next door. The only time I can get out of the house is when I go with friends, but the times are still very strict and I only have two - one is being forced to move far away soon and the other has various valid reasons (work, metal health) why they can't go out often. So I am lucky if I can go out and be myself once a week sometimes.
Any other time I can only go with my father present, no matter what it is.
Once when we didn't have the car for the day so I couldn't be dropped off, I said I would take the bus, and after an argument of that ""you are not going on the bus"", he left the key in the door from the outside to stop me from going. Luckily I was able to push it out and go, but we are talking about a ~7 min trip to the town centre and the bus stop is literally outside the house.

I can't go to events or concerts or anything else normal because I have to purchase an extra ticket for him because I cannot go alone or even just with friends, which I can never afford. The last time I managed to, I was made to leave early before the part of the event I mainly went for as punishment for going.

I have never done anything to warrant this behaviour. I don't and never have drank, smoked, done drugs, or partied. I've never done anything behind their backs. I've had one boyfriend my whole life and the relationship broke down due to the stress my situation caused on it. 

The excuse is always that it's 'not safe' and I'll get attacked/r*ped the second I step out the house, but everyone else manages to go about their lives as usual and I'm not exactly desirable. The fact I'm over 30 aside, I've gained significant weight since being confined to the house. I barely eat but I am stuck within  4 small walls all day and though I try to work out I severely lack the motivation, everything just feels pointless. It also gets used as an excuse that I dress alternative, and while I'm sure we're all mature even here to know that how you're dressed doesnt matter, I dress very conservatively. 

I honestly believe the only reason I have unmonitored Internet access and my own bank account is because as he's grown older, he's lost his tech skills entirely.

He entirely lacks the emotional intelligence to even have a discussion about it and won't even engage the topic any time I try to discuss it like an adult. I've tried calmly talking, I've tried compromises, and I've tried causing arguments, and nothing works.

As I get older, the controlling behaviour gets worse and everything I loved and found fun in my life is gradually losing its spark.  I've always been intensely passionate about video games as an art form and used to be able to use them as a way to leave and experience things vicariously, but lately it feels like I don't even enjoy them anymore. I struggle to write, paint, or do anything creative.

Despite this, I am still expected to do and know everything. Somehow I am too stupid and untrustworthy to go to a coffee shop alone but I am expected to be knowledgeable about everything and do everything for him. 
My brother (20m) doesn't get treated like this. Granted he's 6 foot and imposing, but he's still 10 years younger. He also is never made to do a single thing. 

My mom is normal but she also fell very ill a while back and simply doesn't have the energy to fight for me anymore. She also left home and moved abroad at a young age and does have the attitude of I did it so why can't you? Completely dismissing the fact you could just show up somewhere, ask for a job and be working the same day back then.
My last job was as a temp but part of the reason I wasn't brought on permanently is because it was a place with strict security protocols and he'd always hover around the building breaking them, regardless of my begging. Everyone's advice is always just 'just do it anyway,' as in go out without asking, but I don't have a house key and the only way out is in a place where you can't leave secretly. Last time I just went he followed me and I just ended up having even more freedoms restricted.

The evil deviant things I want to go out and do are to go to coffee shops, the arcade, or thrifting.

I'm not even allowed to sit in my room for long without being treated like a bad person for it. I am reaching my limit.  I don't want to die because I have pets and I love painting and the arts and you can't paint when you're dead. But if things don't change within the next 5 years I think I will do it as it is the only way I will get away. If it wasn't for my sick mom and friends I think I would've already done it. This is already happening at 30, I refuse to be 40 and being told I cannot live normally.

My friends aren't in a financial situation to help me and I don't have any other family.
I am starting to deeply resent him and I hate myself for it, but this is tarnishing all my good memories too now.

I‚Äôve seen actual doctors saying that an acidic state in kidneys and urine can hasten the clearance of lisdexamfetamine. But when I Google acidifying kidneys and urine I mostly get woowoo wellness influencer types talking about it.

So if your therapeutic level of Vyvanse/Elvanse is high enough to make it last a bit longer than is optimal for good sleep. Assuming that someone is already taking it very early, like 5am to begin with.

Is there anything you can consume at the end of the day* that would legitimately cause lisdexamfetamine to clear rapidly?

1obb1mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1obb1mc/4_years_of_worsening_food_intolerances_and_im/,4 years of worsening food intolerances and I'm worried it's Crohns. Anyone experienced anything similar?,"About 4 years ago, I suddenly became intolerant to gluten. A year later, high-FODMAP foods started causing issues too, so I switched to low-FODMAP fruits and vegetables. Would feel like I constantly had to poop but couldn't (very similar to the gluten issue).

In 2023, I began developing even more food intolerances and started alternating between constipation and diarrhea on a weekly cycle.

By 2024, I discovered I was intolerant to eggs ‚Äî the day after reintroducing them (after eliminating them for a month), I almost ended up in the hospital from the pain. I also cut out coffee completely.

In Jan 2025, I had a negative colonoscopy even though my symptoms continued. I‚Äôd poop 15‚Äì20+ times a day ... half the time urgently, half the time feeling blocked with tons of gas buildup. I was basically stuck in the washroom most of the day.

After the colonoscopy, my gastroenterologist ordered:

* SIBO breath test
* Lactose intolerance test
* Lipase/amylase blood tests
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone test
* General bacteria and parasite stool tests

All negative.

She told me to start eliminating food and see a naturopath or dietician about the food intolerances. I cut out most vegetables and fruit, then dairy. Then all carbs.  By May 2025, I went full carnivore and hated it, but for the first time in two years, I had almost zero bloating, gas, or urgency. I went from 20+ bowel movements a day to 1‚Äì4. However I had zero energy.

A naturopath (recommended by my gastro) suggested my gut might be inflamed and that fiber itself could be irritating it. She ordered a comprehensive stool analysis, which showed:

* Low elastase (249) ‚Äî not dangerously low but below normal
* High secretory IgA ‚Äî inflammation marker
* All gut bacteria and candida levels optimal (which seemed odd)

She recommended L-glutamine + zinc carnosine drinks before breakfast and bed to help heal my gut lining.

I tried reintroducing foods, but rice was the only thing that worked. Any fruit, vegetable, or dairy product would cause gas buildup, brain fog, and 15+ bowel movements the next day.

I went back to my gastro, who ordered more tests:

* Bowel CT scan *(scheduled for December)*
* C. diff
* Another SIBO test
* More parasite and bacteria panels
* Stool calprotectin
* C-reactive protein

Everything so far came back negative (just waiting on the bowel X-ray/CT in December). She told me to stay on carnivore since that gave me the most relief.

I‚Äôm still on carnivore... but even meat is starting to trigger symptoms. My white blood cells have been 3.0 since this started (in the low territory, so my doctor doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Crohn‚Äôs. Apparently they'd be elevated if it was ... but we‚Äôll see after the CT scan.

At this point, I‚Äôm almost certain it‚Äôs not bacterial or fungal, based on the repeated negative SIBO and stool tests. It feels more like my gut is reacting to certain foods regardless of type ... almost like an autoimmune or hypersensitivity issue. Dairy makes it extremely bad, and any kind of fiber sets it off.

I just went through Thanksgiving (Canada) getting lectured by my family about cholesterol and why I‚Äôm ‚Äúchoosing‚Äù not to eat vegetables‚Ä¶

Has anyone experienced something like this? Severe food intolerances, low elastase, high IgA, and worsening symptoms even on an elimination or carnivore diet?

Any ideas what this could be? Crohn‚Äôs seems like the only thing that fits, despite the low WBC. I‚Äôm honestly running out of things it could be.

‚ÄúGoodbye forever,‚Äù she said as she turned the keys in the ignition and the car‚Äôs engine began to rumble. The rumble was just enough noise to alert her parents of the escape attempt, but it was too late; by the time the front door was open, Mattie‚Äôs car was already in the street, and her dad saw nothing but the taillights before they rounded the corner, out of sight.

The sky suddenly turned its shade to blue as the yellow sun appeared to Mattie‚Äôs left. She smiled and rolled the window down to let the cool summer air in. She turned on some music. Don‚Äôt Fear the Reaper echoed through the neighborhood as if to announce Mattie‚Äôs departure and lack of regret. She did not travel far before stopping at a diner to get breakfast.¬†

‚ÄúWhat can I get you to drink?‚Äù The waiter smiled earnestly and set a menu on the table.

‚ÄúUhh, I‚Äôll just start with water, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll be right back with that.‚Äù She looked between each of the patrons as she waited. An old man sitting by himself, staring at his coffee; an old woman picking at her pancakes without eating them.

‚ÄúI wonder if they know each other,‚Äù Mattie said to herself. Then her eyes went to a middle-aged man sitting near the door. She didn‚Äôt notice him when she came in. He sat staring straight ahead at the seat across from him in his booth. He was wearing a shabby suit and tie along with a fedora. Upon focusing on his face for a moment, she realized that she knew him.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your water,‚Äù the waiter returned.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you ready to order?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, can I have eggs and pancakes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you like your eggs?‚Äù

‚ÄúScrambled.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi! Mr. Oliver!‚Äù

‚ÄúMay I sit with you for a bit?‚Äù He gave a smile that seemed genuine for a moment, but disappeared from the eyes long before it left his mouth.

‚ÄúFor sure.‚Äù He sat across from her. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs little Toby doing? Would he be ten now?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs eight and he‚Äôs doing great. Good grades in school. He‚Äôs got his mom‚Äôs brain thank god.‚Äù She looked at the bags under his eyes and in doing so noticed the redness that inhabited most of the white surrounding his pupil.¬†

‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù She asked. He immediately became self-conscious about his appearance.

‚ÄúUhh, well. I‚Äôve been pretty busy. It‚Äôs been hard.‚Äù Mattie felt sorry for him, but she had a feeling she knew where this was going, and she also knew she had to take full advantage. But, before that.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your pancakes, ma'am.‚Äù They looked delicious.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you need anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm good, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnjoy.‚Äù Mattie poured syrup onto her pancakes as Oliver clearly wanted to ask a question.

‚ÄúWhy did you come over?‚Äù Mattie asked.

‚ÄúI uh. I wanted to ask you if you would be willing to watch Toby for a couple of days. I have a new product to sell.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just some useless crap, but it has a certain visual appeal.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt try and sell them to me then.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt quite understand what he meant by that. ‚ÄúAnyway, would you be willing to do that? I will pay you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù

‚ÄúA thousand.‚Äù Mattie almost choked on her pancakes.

‚ÄúFor babysitting?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnce I return from this trip, I won‚Äôt have any money worries; you‚Äôve helped us out a lot with Toby before, so I want to be generous.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, in that case. Can you pay for my pancakes as well?‚Äù¬†

Oliver laughed. ‚ÄúYes, I can.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the tip?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, in that case. You got a deal.‚Äù

‚ÄúI leave today.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat works for me.‚Äù

Mr. Oliver lived in a different house than Mattie remembered. He replaced his homey ranch-style on the other side of town with the stone visage of this much bigger house. As opposed to radiating warmth from the mustard yellow paint and the bright-looking windows, this house exuded coldness with its grey stone and windows that spied. The grounds around the house were not well kept, as the hedge that seemed to be meant as a privacy wall was overgrown, and the stone walkways around the gardens were inhabited by green invaders unchecked by a groundskeeper. The house reminded Mattie of a gothic mansion, but it was not nearly big enough, and the large garden out front seemed incredibly out of place as all of the neighboring houses featured plain grass yards with small garden patches near their front doors.¬†

‚ÄúWhen did you move here?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost a year ago now. After Eleanor, umm.‚Äù As he approached the door, his hand began to shake.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you don‚Äôt have to explain anymore.‚Äù Mattie‚Äôs eyes couldn‚Äôt look straight at him as a more fulfilled picture of Mr. Oliver‚Äôs present state of living invaded her mind. She pretended to take an interest in the design of the door, which reminded her of something she couldn‚Äôt quite place.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He opened the door, revealing the home‚Äôs interior. The first thing that surprised Mattie was the modern look of everything. Whether it was through refurbishment or the house being built more recently than she had initially thought, the interior was very modern compared to the exterior. She expected it to be filled to the brim with old paintings and photos of long-dead former inhabitants, along with a pervasive draught, but none of those things were present. Instead, the walls appeared painted recently with a theme of gold-yellow running through the place.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúToby!‚Äù Oliver yelled. ‚ÄúMattie is here!‚Äù Toby walked down the stairs slowly. He yawned. ‚ÄúWere you sleeping?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Hi Mattie!‚Äù He got a small burst of energy as he looked at Mattie and recognized her.

‚ÄúHi, Toby! How are you?‚Äù She knelt down to his level as he approached.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay.‚Äù The lack of energy was surprising. Mattie remembered this kid as a bullet that she usually had to pin down.

‚ÄúYou tired?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI have to leave.‚Äù Oliver interrupted as he checked his watch. ‚ÄúFridge is fully stocked, and the bus will pick him up tomorrow around seven-fifteen, although it‚Äôs sometimes early, so have him at the stop close to seven. Other than that, just make sure he‚Äôs in bed before I‚Äôd say eleven.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat late?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe day after tomorrow is Saturday, so I‚Äôm not too worried about it,‚Äù Oliver spoke defensively.

‚ÄúOkay, we can watch some spooky movies. How does that sound?‚Äù Toby‚Äôs eyes lit up a little.

‚ÄúYes, please, and popcorn.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm gonna leave now. You two have fun. I should be back Saturday night.‚Äô

‚ÄúGood luck, Mr. Oliver.‚Äù

‚ÄúBye, Dad!‚Äù They were left to themselves.¬†

That night, Mattie and Toby sat on the couch with a large bowl of freshly popped popcorn.

‚ÄúYour dad doesn‚Äôt still have the Shudder subscription, does he?‚Äù She asked. Toby shrugged his shoulders.

‚ÄúOkay, we‚Äôll just try it.‚Äù She put in the login and password that she remembered. She smiled as the Shudder homepage came up. ‚ÄúYes! Now we're in business.‚Äù They picked a movie about a haunted house on a hill with an unsuspecting visitor. She was a little more exhausted than she anticipated so she ended up falling asleep. When she woke up, it was twelve-thirty.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù She looked at Toby. He was sound asleep on the other side of the couch. She relaxed. ‚ÄúWell, at least he‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù Whatever movie was playing when she woke back up was currently in a very dimly lit scene, but as she looked at Toby, a character in the movie turned a light on. At that moment, she saw it. Standing behind the couch over Toby. It gave the impression of a man, but she couldn‚Äôt see any identifying features. He appeared as an entirely black figure wearing a trilby hat and a trench coat.¬†

Mattie was frozen, staring at the thing with no face.¬†

‚ÄúI hope he comes back.‚Äù He spoke quietly in a voice that Mattie immediately afterward could not recall the sound of. He turned to look at her, revealing two tiny white lights where his eyes should‚Äôve been and the vague outline of a face that wasn‚Äôt human.

‚ÄúWh-who would that be?‚Äù The figure stood inhumanly still, then the light from the TV darkened, blanketing him in shadow again. She searched the house with a flashlight but couldn‚Äôt find anything.¬†

The next day, Mattie made sure Toby got to school and spent the whole day searching through the house again. Eventually, she thoroughly searched everything except Mr. Oliver‚Äôs room. It was locked, but fortunately, Mattie had found herself needing a door to not be locked before. She retrieved a bobby pin and made short work of it. Still, little of note was found until she came across a loose floorboard. Using a kitchen knife, she pried it open and found a leather case. It was about the size of a large textbook and had a very old golden buckle that sealed it shut. Despite the case looking important, it did not have any locking mechanism or some such other thing to prevent unwanted eyes from seeing the contents of the case. So, naturally, she opened it.¬†

Toby came home after school, and Mattie made dinner for both of them. The two of them were silent while eating. It became clear to Mattie that Toby must know something about what she saw the night before. So, she decided to try and get him to talk.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt seem very scared by that movie last night.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen scarier.‚Äù Toby shrugged.

Mattie chuckled. ‚ÄúOh yeah, where?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHave you seen him yet?‚Äù Despite this being exactly where she wanted the conversation to go, she was surprised by how quickly he brought it up.¬†

‚ÄúThe man in the hat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe says the case is his.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, is it now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and he said if dad doesn‚Äôt give it back, he‚Äôs going to take me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, take you?‚Äù Toby shrugged.¬†

‚ÄúSo, what is your dad doing with the case?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHe wants to sell it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIs that where he went?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so. He‚Äôs tried a couple of times.‚Äù Mattie rested her head on her arms and looked at the table for a moment. She looked at the kitchen knives.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let him take you, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù¬†

He appeared again that night along with a thunderstorm. He followed Mattie around the house for hours, though she was only able to catch glimpses of him in the corner of her eye or in the corner of a room. She wondered why he was watching her now and not Toby. Eventually, they were both on the couch watching another movie. Mattie hid one of the kitchen knives between the couch cushions just in case.

‚ÄúYou can sleep, Toby. I‚Äôll keep an eye out for him.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOkay, thank you, Mattie.‚Äù She wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sleep if she tried, which helped her with her watch. But she caught what she didn‚Äôt expect. A key jingled and scratched against the front door. She quickly grabbed the knife and stood between Toby and the source of the noise. Mr. Oliver stepped through the door.

As he did so, she remembered what the door reminded her of. It was made of the same dark, polished wood that the door to her dad‚Äôs childhood home was. It rushed back memories of her father.

‚ÄúMattie?‚Äù He looked surprised by the sight that greeted him, but he quickly understood. ‚ÄúNow, wait a minute, Mattie. Think about this.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt think about it. She lunged forward with the knife and securely lodged it in his throat. He dropped to his knees, gurgling and unable to scream. Toby was still sleeping.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to bury him.‚Äù The figure appeared before her with glowing eyes. He began chuckling. ‚ÄúIf you can find a spot!‚Äù He was laughing from his stomach now. Although the laugh was so inhuman, she wasn‚Äôt sure if he even had a stomach; she also wasn‚Äôt sure what he meant by his words, but when she took a shovel and picked a spot in one of the flower beds, she found out.

She dug in the storm for what at that point had been a couple of hours. She dug until she hit something, and upon clearing more of the dirt, she discovered a human skull.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù She dug in another spot and found more bones. And another, and another.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!?‚Äù She screamed into the night. Everywhere she dug, there was already a body or the remnants of one. She dug until she found one that wasn‚Äôt bone yet. The features were still recognizable, so she was able to pick out that it was Eleanor. Mattie began crying, although if anyone was to see her, it would be impossible to distinguish the tears from the rain.

‚ÄúWhy did he come home early? If I had time to think, I wouldn‚Äôt have done that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true.‚Äù The figure stood on one of the stone walkways in the garden. A dark silhouette with two points like stars under his hat. ‚ÄúYou need to have the case. And for as long as you have it, I will take everything from you. Although, since you killed Mr. Oliver over there, I think I already have.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre right.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù The figure turned his head toward the house.

‚ÄúDo you still want him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Oliver‚Äôs. And Oliver doesn‚Äôt have the case anymore. You do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen the least I can do is take it as far away from him as possible.‚Äù¬†

He laughed. ‚ÄúI stand corrected. There is still a little something there for me to take after all.‚Äù The lightning struck, and in the small moment of light, the figure‚Äôs face revealed taut skin and teeth with no lips shaped into the permanent impression of a smile devoid of happiness and eyes from which light was bled but no light was beheld. Then came the thunder.¬†",1,1760935769.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I'm having constant issues with bottomless portafilter on the delonghi dedica.

If the grind is fine enough for a 25 second second shot, the pf would just slide off due to pressure mid way.

I also tried changing gaskets, it's not a fix.

The only way to brew coffee is used coarse grind and quick shot time (15-17 second)

I have tried THW bottomless portafilter and normcore bottomless portafilter.

I talked to someone and he suggested, just get the original pressurised portafilter and basket. Atleast it will not slide off and make okayish coffee instead of trying to get the best with bottomless portafilter and getting nothing.


If anyone has a delonghi dedica and has upgraded to the bottomless portafilter, I will buy your stock PF, please dm me with photo and price.

1obawx0,https://youtu.be/pHTNnw20jug,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Halloween Decorations Horror Stories,"# ""The Garden Beds"":

I grew up in a small town tucked deep in the countryside, where the roads were more dirt than gravel and the houses sat so far apart you could scream and no one would hear you right away. My family had just moved into our place that summer, a weathered old farmhouse surrounded by tall grass and crooked fences. By the time the leaves turned and the air grew sharp, I was already counting the days until my first Halloween there.

I was twelve‚Äîold enough to roam with my cousins without the adults hovering. Our grandparents lived just down the road, and my aunt Lisa‚Äôs place was a short walk through a wooded path. The only thing between our houses was the property belonging to Mrs. Harlan.

Mrs. Harlan was... different. Tall, bony, with long arms and a face that always looked like she‚Äôd been carved out of candle wax. She was always out on her porch, scrubbing the wood with a stiff brush or digging in her garden even when it was cold. Heavy boots, long faded dresses, hair tied back so tight it pulled at her temples. Folks said she lived alone since her husband died years ago. No one ever saw visitors, and she didn‚Äôt come to town much. Still, her house wasn‚Äôt abandoned‚Äîjust quiet. Too quiet.

That Halloween, my cousins and I had our route mapped out like a treasure hunt. I was a pirate, Tim was a cowboy, and little Emma‚Äîonly eight‚Äîwas a fairy with glitter wings that trailed sparkles wherever she went. Grandpa sat on his porch handing out candy, while Aunt Lisa waved us off with her usual warning:  
‚ÄúStick together. And don‚Äôt bother anyone without their lights on, got it?‚Äù

We promised.

But as we started down the path toward Aunt Lisa‚Äôs, we noticed something strange‚ÄîMrs. Harlan‚Äôs porch light was on. Not bright, but faint, flickering like a candle behind the old glass fixture. There were decorations too: a crooked jack-o‚Äô-lantern by the steps, a few fake cobwebs across her fence, and a scarecrow slumped near the garden, its head drooping to one side.

Tim grinned. ‚ÄúSee? She‚Äôs got candy. Come on, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

Emma hesitated. ‚ÄúShe looks mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Halloween,‚Äù Tim said. ‚ÄúShe probably just likes spooky stuff.‚Äù

So we went.

The closer we got, the quieter it felt. Even the crickets seemed to hush. The scarecrow loomed ahead, clothes tattered, one arm missing. Up close, it smelled faintly of something sweet and rotten‚Äîlike old fruit. I remember the garden beds behind it, piled high with dirt, the kind that looked freshly turned.

When I knocked, the sound echoed through the house. Nothing. Then, a shuffle. Something heavy moved across the floor inside‚Äîthump, drag, thump.

The door opened just a few inches, hinges groaning.

And there she was.

Mrs. Harlan filled the doorway, taller than I remembered. Her skin looked pale, stretched thin, and her hands shook slightly as she held something round, heavy, and dripping.

For a moment my brain didn‚Äôt understand what I was looking at. Then the smell hit‚Äîa coppery, wet, undeniable smell.

It was a head. A human head.

Its mouth hung open, eyes clouded and lifeless, hair matted with blood.

Emma screamed, and the sound snapped me loose. We all turned and ran, candy bags spilling behind us. My heart hammered so loud it drowned out everything else. I didn‚Äôt stop until we crashed through Grandpa‚Äôs front door.

Aunt Lisa rushed over, face pale. ‚ÄúWhat happened? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Harlan‚Äîshe had a head!‚Äù I gasped.

Tim nodded frantically. ‚ÄúA real one! She showed it to us!‚Äù

Grandpa frowned, but I saw doubt flicker in his eyes. ‚ÄúNow, kids... it‚Äôs Halloween. Probably just a prop.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt!‚Äù I shouted.

Aunt Lisa chewed her lip, uneasy. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have gone there. She‚Äôs... not right, that one. Best you stay clear of her.‚Äù

We tried to let it go. Ate candy, watched a movie, pretended it was nothing. But that night, when I lay in bed at Grandpa‚Äôs, I heard something faint outside‚Äîa distant scraping sound. Like metal dragging through soil. I told myself it was animals, but I didn‚Äôt sleep much after that.

Weeks passed. Life went on. But Aunt Lisa started mentioning strange things. She‚Äôd catch glimpses of movement in her yard at night. Sometimes she‚Äôd look out her kitchen window and swear she saw Mrs. Harlan standing there in the dark, staring.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs always digging,‚Äù Aunt Lisa told Grandma one evening. ‚ÄúAlways adding dirt to those same garden beds. Like she‚Äôs hiding something.‚Äù

We laughed it off, but there was something brittle in the air after that.

Then came the day that still haunts me.

It was early afternoon, the air crisp and bright. I was helping Grandpa fix a fence when we heard a scream‚Äîsharp and distant‚Äîfrom down the path.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Lisa!‚Äù Grandpa shouted, dropping his tools.

We ran. I remember the smell of wet leaves and cold earth as we tore down that path. When we reached Aunt Lisa‚Äôs house, I saw her on the porch‚Äîstruggling against a tall, ragged figure.

Mrs. Harlan.

She had something in her hands‚Äîa long, jagged saw with rope handles. She‚Äôd looped it around Aunt Lisa‚Äôs neck, sawing back and forth while Aunt Lisa clawed and kicked, blood splattering across the steps.

Grandpa didn‚Äôt hesitate. He grabbed a shovel from the yard and slammed it against her back. The sound that came from Mrs. Harlan wasn‚Äôt a scream. It was a hiss, low and furious, like an animal caught in a trap.

She fell, dropping the saw. Aunt Lisa staggered free, clutching her neck, crimson soaking her shirt.

‚ÄúShe came out of nowhere,‚Äù she rasped. ‚ÄúJust‚Äîjust attacked me.‚Äù

I ran inside and called the police, shaking so hard I nearly dropped the phone.

They came fast for our little town. Hauled Mrs. Harlan away while she muttered things no one could quite understand‚Äîabout ‚Äúkeeping them close,‚Äù about ‚Äúcompany in the dark.‚Äù

The investigation that followed tore our quiet little community apart.

Under her house, they found tunnels‚Äîhand-dug, narrow, snaking under neighboring properties. One ran beneath Aunt Lisa‚Äôs yard. Another stretched toward ours. The dirt from those tunnels? All piled up neatly in her garden beds.

And in the deepest tunnel, a hidden room.

The walls lined with shelves.

On them‚Äîfive human heads. Preserved somehow. Faces gray and drawn, eyes staring. People who‚Äôd gone missing over the years‚Äîhikers, drifters, even a local boy from long ago. She‚Äôd kept them, cared for them, talked to them like they were alive.

One of the officers told Grandpa quietly later, ‚ÄúThe head your grandkids saw that night‚Äîit was fresh. Belonged to a missing man from a town over. She must‚Äôve wanted to scare them off.‚Äù

Aunt Lisa healed, though she carried a scar at her throat for the rest of her life. Mrs. Harlan‚Äôs house was torn down. The tunnels were filled with concrete. People started putting in porch lights and motion sensors after that.

But even now, when October comes, I still think about that night. The flickering light. The scarecrow slumped in her yard. The smell of damp soil and something sweet beneath it.

And I wonder‚Äîhow many were buried right there under our feet?

These days, every Halloween, I lock my doors early. I don‚Äôt answer knocks after dark. Because sometimes the scariest monsters don‚Äôt wear masks.

Sometimes they‚Äôre the ones who live right next door‚Äî  
waiting for you to knock first.





# ""Halloween.exe"":

I decided to upgrade our Halloween setup this year with some smart gadgets. Living out in the countryside, our house sat alone on a quiet road, half-hidden by tall maples that rustled like whispers when the wind picked up. We never got many trick-or-treaters out here, but for the few kids who made the drive, I wanted it to feel special.

So, I went all in‚Äîremote-controlled color-changing porch lights, animatronic skeletons that could move on command, and a Bluetooth speaker system hidden in the bushes to play moans, chains, and faint laughter. Everything synced through an app on my phone, a kind of digital command center for fear.

Lisa, my wife, thought I was overdoing it, but she still helped me string lights and position the skeletons along the driveway. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre turning this into a theme park,‚Äù she said, smirking as she untangled a string of orange bulbs.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the point,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúA little countryside horror magic.‚Äù

That afternoon, I tested the system. One tap on my phone, and the lights bled from pumpkin orange to blood red. Another tap‚Äîservo motors whirred to life, the skeletons creaking as their heads turned toward the house, eyes glowing an eerie green. Then came the sound‚Äîlow moans echoing across the yard like something stirring from the woods.

‚ÄúThis is going to be great,‚Äù I said, grinning.

Lisa laughed but shook her head. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt make the kids cry, Alex.‚Äù

As night fell, we got our first visitors. A car pulled up, headlights cutting through the mist. I activated the setup from the living room‚Äîlights pulsing, skeletons jerking to life, fog spilling from the ground unit near the porch steps. The kids screamed, then laughed, and even the parents chuckled from the car. Lisa handed out candy, shooting me a teasing look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like a director back there.‚Äù

It felt good‚Äîlike I‚Äôd built a tiny haunted attraction out of our lonely stretch of road.

But around nine, after the last car disappeared into the night, things shifted.

I powered everything down through the app‚Äîjust a faint amber glow left on the porch to save battery. Lisa and I were sitting on the couch, half-watching a Halloween movie, when the porch lights suddenly flared back to full brightness‚Äîflashing red and purple in rapid bursts.

Lisa frowned. ‚ÄúDid you just do that?‚Äù

I glanced at my phone. The app still showed the lights as dimmed. ‚ÄúProbably just a glitch,‚Äù I muttered, tapping the reset icon. The lights calmed.

Then, a faint motor sound came from outside‚Äîslow, mechanical, familiar. One of the skeletons had come to life again.

I looked through the front window. Its head turned toward the house, the LED eyes glowing in the dark.

‚ÄúAlex, that‚Äôs not funny,‚Äù Lisa said sharply.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù I started, but stopped. My phone still said all devices were off. I toggled the setting again, but the skeleton didn‚Äôt stop. Its arms began to rise, creaking, as though reaching toward the porch.

My chest tightened. I stepped outside into the cold, still air, the night eerily quiet except for the soft hum of its servos. I yanked the plug from the smart outlet. The skeleton went limp instantly.

Back inside, I locked the door. ‚ÄúProbably a bad connection,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. Lisa didn‚Äôt answer.

We turned the TV back on, the laughter from the movie a little too bright, too normal. Then the speakers outside crackled. Static first‚Äîthen a voice.

‚ÄúNice decorations,‚Äù it said, distorted and low.

Lisa sat up straight. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

The voice came again, clearer now, closer. ‚ÄúI like watching you.‚Äù

I froze. That wasn‚Äôt one of my pre-loaded sounds. My throat went dry as I grabbed a flashlight and went outside. The bushes where I‚Äôd hidden the speakers looked normal, but the sound seemed to move‚Äîlike it was circling.

I ripped the nearest speaker‚Äôs plug out. Silence.

Back inside, I tried to steady my breathing. ‚ÄúProbably interference,‚Äù I said, though even I didn‚Äôt buy it. Lisa‚Äôs face was pale.

‚ÄúCall the company, Alex. This isn‚Äôt right.‚Äù

The support line went to voicemail. I told her we‚Äôd try in the morning. We locked every door and went upstairs, trying to sleep. Lisa drifted off, but I lay awake, scrolling through forums. Posts about smart-home hacks. Weak passwords. Some even mentioned strangers taking over entire systems. My password was my birthday.

Around midnight, the lights flickered again.

Through the crack under the bedroom door, I saw flashes‚Äîred, purple, white‚Äîshifting fast. I got out of bed, heart hammering. Downstairs, the porch was alive with strobing light.

The app crashed as soon as I opened it.

Then, the laughter came back. Not from outside this time‚Äîfrom inside.

Our smart home hub on the living room shelf glowed faint blue.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt turn me off that easy,‚Äù the voice said, calm, mocking.

I lunged forward and pulled the plug. The light died. The room went still‚Äîuntil my phone buzzed.

A new notification: **Guest user added.**

My stomach dropped. I hadn‚Äôt done that.

The voice came again, this time from somewhere else‚Äîour living room speaker. ‚ÄúYour house looks so inviting from out here.‚Äù

I grabbed the flashlight and ran out back. The night felt too quiet, the air too heavy. My beam caught the unplugged speaker unit still glowing faintly. I smashed it. The voice stopped mid-sentence.

When I got back inside, Lisa was standing on the stairs, eyes wide. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs here,‚Äù she whispered.

I called 911. The dispatcher said a car would be sent but warned it could take a while‚Äîwe were remote.

We waited, every creak in the house making us flinch. Through the window, I saw one of the skeletons twitch. Then another. Both began to move, arms waving like grotesque marionettes. I had unplugged them. I *knew* I had.

Lisa grabbed my arm. ‚ÄúThe app controls the plugs remotely, right? Someone‚Äôs inside our network.‚Äù

Then my phone rang‚Äî**Unknown Number.**

I answered, voice shaking.

A man‚Äôs voice, distorted but clear enough to chill my blood: ‚ÄúYou should secure your network better, Alex.‚Äù

He said my name.

‚ÄúI saw your setup online,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúEasy to find.‚Äù

My mind raced back to the social media post we‚Äôd shared earlier‚Äîa cheerful photo of Lisa handing out candy on the porch.

‚ÄúLeave us alone,‚Äù I said.

He chuckled. ‚ÄúBut the show‚Äôs just starting.‚Äù

The call ended. The porch lights flared one last time, the skeletons jerking like they were applauding.

When the police arrived twenty minutes later, the yard was dark and still. They checked everything, found no one. ‚ÄúProbably a hack,‚Äù one of them said. ‚ÄúThese smart systems are easy targets. Change your passwords, add two-factor authentication.‚Äù

Lisa nodded numbly. I just stood there, staring at the silent skeletons.

We tore everything down the next morning. Factory reset, boxed up, shoved into the attic. I deleted the app, changed every password I could think of.

Months later, I still check the locks twice every night. Sometimes, one of the porch lights flickers for no reason, just once, like a wink from the dark.

And every time it happens, I wonder‚Äîif he‚Äôs still out there, watching.

Those smart decorations? Never again.

Because for one night, I wasn‚Äôt the one controlling them.





# ""Cold Flesh"":

The cabin sat deep in the woods, far down a dirt road that hardly anyone used anymore. Ten miles from the nearest house, twenty from town. The kind of place where the world goes quiet and stays that way. Tom once told me he liked it there because no one bothered him ‚Äî said it gave him time to think. But lately, he hadn‚Äôt been himself. He‚Äôd started talking about people he owed money to, about ‚Äúfixing‚Äù something before it got worse. I had a bad feeling.

That afternoon, I drove out to check on him. The truck‚Äôs engine growled as I turned onto the overgrown driveway, weeds brushing against the sides. The cabin looked worse than ever ‚Äî boards nailed haphazardly across some windows, vines creeping up the siding. But what caught my eye wasn‚Äôt the decay. It was the decorations.

Someone had gone all-out for Halloween. Fake cobwebs draped over the porch railing, two plastic pumpkins by the steps, even a scarecrow slumped against a tree. It was strange ‚Äî nobody lived here anymore, and no kids came this far out. Probably a prank, I thought. Local teenagers, maybe.

Then I saw something else.

About twenty feet from the cabin, half-hidden in the grass, lay what looked like a mannequin. Face down, dressed only in underwear and socks. Arms stretched out stiffly, legs awkwardly twisted. I almost laughed under my breath ‚Äî a Halloween prop, I figured. A dark joke to match the rest of the setup. I shook my head and walked past it toward the porch.

‚ÄúTom?‚Äù I called, pushing the door open. The hinges groaned in protest. The smell hit first ‚Äî damp wood, mold, old smoke. ‚ÄúYou in here?‚Äù

No answer.

I pulled out my flashlight, the beam cutting through the gloom. The place looked abandoned but familiar: a couch with torn cushions, a table littered with bottles, and in the corner ‚Äî Tom‚Äôs blue backpack. The one with the rip down the side. My pulse kicked up a notch.

I crouched beside it, unzipping the flap. Inside were his wallet, a half-eaten sandwich, and a small notebook. One page, written in hurried scrawl, read:  
**‚ÄúMeet J at 8. Pay up or else.‚Äù**

J. I‚Äôd heard him mention that name before, but he‚Äôd never said who it was.

I moved into the kitchen ‚Äî dishes crusted with old food, cans stacked by the sink. That‚Äôs when I heard it: a faint rustle outside. Leaves crunching. Someone ‚Äî or something ‚Äî moving.

I froze. Waited. Nothing.

Trying to steady my breath, I kept searching, stepping into the bedroom. The sheets were tangled, the air stale. On the nightstand sat his phone, screen cracked. I plugged it in and powered it on. The last message was from an unknown number.  
**‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide. Be there tonight.‚Äù**  
Sent two days ago.

My stomach dropped.

I slipped the phone into my pocket and went back outside. The mannequin was still there ‚Äî unmoving in the grass. But something about it made me pause. The position looked wrong, too human. I walked closer, crouched beside it. Dirt smeared the skin. There were scrapes across the back, like it had been dragged.

A fly buzzed near the shoulder.

‚ÄúWhy would someone leave this out here?‚Äù I muttered.

I reached out and touched the arm. Cold. But not like plastic ‚Äî like skin gone cold. I jerked my hand back. The fingers had chipped nails. Real nails. My throat went dry. There was a tattoo on the upper arm ‚Äî a small eagle. Tom‚Äôs eagle. The one from his Army days.

I flipped the body over.

His face stared up, pale and lifeless, eyes glassy. Bruises on the neck. Cuts on the arms. It was Tom.

My knees nearly gave out.

I stumbled back, my flashlight slipping from my hand. The Halloween props ‚Äî the cobwebs, the pumpkins ‚Äî they‚Äôd made it look staged, fake. Someone wanted it that way.

I called the police, voice shaking. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I found a body. My friend. At the old cabin on Shue Road. Please‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúStay where you are,‚Äù the dispatcher said. ‚ÄúOfficers are on the way.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt stay still. I paced the yard, my eyes darting toward the treeline. The woods had gone eerily quiet. Then ‚Äî a sound again. Leaves crunching. Closer.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called out.

No reply.

I grabbed a fallen branch, holding it tight. Then a voice drifted from the shadows. Low. Rough.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here.‚Äù

I turned. A man stepped out from between the trees ‚Äî tall, unshaven, a long scar down his cheek. His jacket looked worn, stained.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I demanded.

He smirked. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Jack. Tom owed me.‚Äù

The name hit like a punch. ‚ÄúJ,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúWhat did you do to him?‚Äù

Jack took a step forward. ‚ÄúHe came to me for help. Got himself in deep. Overdosed on what I gave him. I just‚Ä¶ cleaned up the mess.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou *dumped* him here?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think anyone would come looking.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou killed him!‚Äù

‚ÄúNot on purpose,‚Äù he said, voice calm, almost casual. ‚ÄúBut now you‚Äôve seen too much.‚Äù

He pulled a knife from his pocket. The blade glinted in the fading light.

I backed up fast, tripping over a plastic pumpkin that shattered under my boot. ‚ÄúThe police are coming,‚Äù I blurted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got minutes.‚Äù

Jack chuckled. ‚ÄúOut here? You think they‚Äôll make it in time?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt wait to find out. I bolted for the truck. He lunged, catching my sleeve, but I swung the branch and hit his shoulder. He grunted, staggered back. I slammed the door, turned the key, and tore down the dirt road, gravel spitting behind me.

In the mirror, I saw him standing over Tom‚Äôs body, watching me go.

The police arrived later, but Jack was gone. They ruled Tom‚Äôs death an overdose ‚Äî no signs of foul play. But I knew what I saw. I told them about Jack, the scar, the knife. They took notes. Promised to look into it.

Weeks passed. Nothing.

Then one night, my phone rang ‚Äî an unknown number. I answered without thinking.

‚ÄúYou should forget what you saw,‚Äù said a familiar, gruff voice.

I froze. ‚ÄúJack?‚Äù

Click. The line went dead.

The police traced the number to a burner. No leads.

I drove by the cabin once more, months later. The cobwebs were gone, decorations half-rotted, scarecrow still leaning crooked against the tree. But there was something new pinned to its chest ‚Äî a note scrawled in black ink.

**Next time, it‚Äôs you.**

I burned it right there and never went back.

At Tom‚Äôs funeral, his sister hugged me tight. ‚ÄúThank you for finding him,‚Äù she whispered.

I didn‚Äôt tell her about the note. Or the voice. Or the nightmares that still wake me in the dark ‚Äî the sound of leaves crunching outside my window.

A few months later, a cop friend called. ‚ÄúWe found Jack‚Äôs hideout,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDeep in the woods near Shue Road. Weapons, drugs, everything. But he‚Äôs gone. He‚Äôs still out there.‚Äù

That night, someone knocked on my door.

When I looked outside, no one was there. Just a single plastic pumpkin sitting on the porch.





# ""Hanging Season"":

I grew up in a small Delaware town where the roads wound through open fields and old houses that leaned with age. Out here, the air always smelled faintly of soil and rain, and when the wind died, you could almost hear the silence pressing in. Frederica wasn‚Äôt much‚Äîjust a handful of stores, a post office, a diner that closed too early, and neighbors who waved whether they knew you or not. My house sat on the edge of town, facing the main road, the trees standing like quiet sentries along the shoulder.

That October, I was getting the place ready for Halloween. The leaves had turned brittle and gold, scattering across the porch where my nephew, Danny, and I sat carving pumpkins. He was ten‚Äîbright, restless, and endlessly curious. The kind of kid who could find magic in anything.

‚ÄúUncle, look at this one,‚Äù he said proudly, holding up a lopsided jack-o‚Äô-lantern. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got fangs like a vampire.‚Äù

I laughed, ruffling his hair. ‚ÄúGood job, kid. We‚Äôll put it out front to scare the neighbors.‚Äù

He grinned, his hands covered in pumpkin guts, eyes reflecting the late-morning sun. I bent to light another string of orange bulbs when something caught my attention across the road‚Äîsomething dark, swaying gently from a low branch of the old oak that grew near the ditch.

At first, I thought it was just a bundle of shadows tangled in the wind. Then I squinted. The shape was long, human-like, arms limp, head bowed forward as though in shame.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù I murmured.

Danny followed my gaze. ‚ÄúMaybe a scarecrow. Or a Halloween thing. Looks funny hanging there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, probably,‚Äù I said, forcing a laugh. People around here loved their decorations‚Äîfake corpses on porches, skeletons propped against mailboxes. But that tree stood on an empty lot. No one lived there. I shrugged it off and went back to carving, though I kept glancing up between cuts, just to see if it had moved.

Later, I stopped by my neighbor Mrs. Ellis‚Äôs place. She lived alone in a small white house next door, always smelled faintly of cinnamon and soap. Her curtains never seemed to close fully, and she could tell you exactly who passed by and when.

‚ÄúCome in, dear,‚Äù she said when she saw me at the door. ‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said, stepping into the warmth. ‚ÄúYou see that thing across the way? Hanging from the oak?‚Äù

She peered out the window. ‚ÄúOh, that. Noticed it early this morning. Figured it was some fool kid‚Äôs prank. Looks like a dummy, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Just‚Ä¶ very realistic.‚Äù

Mrs. Ellis chuckled softly. ‚ÄúHalloween brings out people‚Äôs strange side. Remember last year when Mr. Harlan rigged that skeleton to wave? Scared me half to death every morning.‚Äù

I smiled, but unease settled in my stomach like cold lead. As I drove into town later for supplies, I slowed near the tree. From that angle, the details sharpened: pale arms, hair hanging down, rope tight around the neck. The realism made my skin prickle.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a prop,‚Äù I muttered aloud, gripping the wheel. ‚ÄúSomeone went all out.‚Äù

Still, the image stayed with me.

When I got home, I called my sister, Karen. She‚Äôs a nurse‚Äîpractical, level-headed, hard to rattle.

‚ÄúHey, you driving near my road today?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNot yet, why?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this decoration in a tree. Looks‚Ä¶ lifelike. Maybe too lifelike.‚Äù

‚ÄúLifelike how?‚Äù

‚ÄúSkin tone, bruises, the works.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould be a dummy,‚Äù she said, though her tone shifted. ‚ÄúBut if it‚Äôs bothering you, call the police. Better safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to look like an idiot. Everyone else drives by like it‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust your gut,‚Äù she said gently.

I hung up, telling myself to let it go. But every hour or so, I found myself checking the window. Cars passed. A school bus rolled by, kids laughing and pointing out the window. Somehow, that laughter made me feel worse, not better.

By midafternoon, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I grabbed my jacket and crossed the road. The air smelled damp, and the ground underfoot was soft from last night‚Äôs rain. As I drew closer, something metallic hit my nose‚Äîan acrid sweetness I couldn‚Äôt place at first. Then the buzzing of flies reached my ears.

The smell was unmistakable.

I froze beneath the tree. The figure‚Äôs skin wasn‚Äôt painted plastic. It was flesh, mottled and pale. The feet were bare, swollen, bruised. The rope cut deep into the neck.

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out, my voice cracking. No response‚Äîonly the slow sway of the body and the whisper of leaves overhead.

I stepped back, fumbling for my phone. My hands shook as I dialed Mrs. Ellis.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a decoration,‚Äù I said when she answered. ‚ÄúCome out here. Now.‚Äù

She arrived within minutes, apron still on. As she approached, her pace slowed. When her eyes found the figure, her breath hitched audibly.

‚ÄúOh, dear Lord,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a woman.‚Äù

We stood there in silence, the weight of it pressing down. Cars continued to pass, slowing briefly, then speeding away again. The world went on, indifferent.

‚ÄúI thought it was a prank,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúAll morning‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSo did I.‚Äù

I called 911. My voice felt detached as I spoke to the dispatcher. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a body hanging from a tree off Main Road in Frederica. Looks like it‚Äôs been there since morning. Maybe longer.‚Äù

Sirens cut through the quiet ten minutes later. Officer Oldham, a state trooper I‚Äôd known for years, stepped out of his cruiser. His face was drawn tight.

‚ÄúYou the one who called?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. We thought it was fake at first.‚Äù

He glanced up, jaw tightening. ‚ÄúLooks like a suicide. Been here overnight.‚Äù

They worked methodically, setting up tape, photographing, cutting her down. The sound of the rope snapping free made my stomach twist.

Fay Glanden, the mayor‚Äôs wife, arrived soon after, curiosity pulling her in. When she realized what she was seeing, her voice faltered. ‚ÄúI drove by this morning,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúI thought it was one of those Halloween dummies‚Ä¶‚Äù

The officer returned to us after a while. ‚ÄúLocal woman. Forty-two. No note. We‚Äôll contact her family.‚Äù

Her name wasn‚Äôt said aloud, but everyone in Frederica would know by the next morning.

That night, after the news trucks left and the road quieted again, Karen came over with Danny. He‚Äôd heard whispers at school.

‚ÄúWas it really a lady?‚Äù he asked, his voice small.

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. But the police took care of it.‚Äù

Karen touched my arm. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said truthfully. ‚ÄúWe all drove by. We laughed. Nobody looked close enough. That‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt stop thinking about.‚Äù

She hugged me tight. ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt have known.‚Äù

But as I lay in bed that night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The wind outside made the branches scrape against the siding, and every creak sounded like a rope shifting under weight. I thought about how something so terrible could exist in plain sight, mistaken for decoration.

The paper confirmed it days later: suicide, no foul play. Still, something inside me changed. I took down my Halloween lights early that year. No more hanging ghosts, no more fake bodies.

Frederica felt different afterward‚Äîquieter, as if the town itself had been holding its breath. Mrs. Ellis stopped baking as often, and I‚Äôd catch her standing at her window, staring toward that oak tree. Fay organized a candlelight vigil, saying, ‚ÄúWe need to look out for one another.‚Äù

We all nodded, but the truth settled heavy in me. Out here, in places where nothing much happens, the world can grow too still. People can vanish into the background, and sometimes death can hang right in front of our eyes‚Äîwaiting for someone, anyone, to finally notice.",1,1760935423.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

About 6 weeks ago I started experience super itchy skin when I went to bed, mainly my legs and right shoulder. I thought with the weather change I just had dry skin so I upped my moisturizer. As the week went on it just got worse and worse but I‚Äôve never had any sort of rash. It started to progress into an all the time thing. I booked a doctors apt but while I was waiting 

- stopped wearing all jewelry 
- changed my laundry detergent to the closest all natural and re washed everything I‚Äôve been wearing and not using dryer sheets 
- taking a shower in only cool water 
- no perfume at all 
- unplugged all my scented defusers 
- Got a dehumidifier 
- got all new bedding 
- dusted and did a full deep vacuum of my whole apartment moving all furniture 
- slept on the couch for acouple of days to see if that would help ( it didn‚Äôt )
- oatmeal baths 
- started using antihistamines ( they barley work ) 

* I‚Äôm a creature of habit so I have not had any diet changes in the last 6 months 
* I only drink water and coffee ( no alcohol, juices or soda )


I finally had my doctors apt and we did blood work, urine and he started me on prednisone (5 days on 50MG) the prednisone helped for three days and then the itchiness came back full force. 

All my blood work and urine came back normal. I‚Äôm now waiting to get in with a dermatologist but the alt isn‚Äôt till Dec.1 and the appointment with the allergist isn‚Äôt till May. 2026.

Any other jobs that meet the list of things that are important to me?,"So, I am a 23y/o female. I have a bachelors degree in psychology. I have had professional jobs in hospital psych units providing group counseling and doing psycho social assessments. I have found out that psych may not be the route for me as there is little progression unless you become a therapist which I do not want to do. I am currently working as a server because I make more than working in psych with less hours. I do like that I have flexible hours in serving, am able to pick up shifts, meeting new people, and I like being busy during the rush. But I am looking for a career that provides me health insurance and job security.

My mother and grandma are both nurses. I have been thinking about nursing for years but haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger. Some days I will be so sure and others I am not. I am looking for purpose in my job, along with challenges, opportunities for growth, and a flexible schedule. I also DO NOT want to work a M-F desk job. I have done so before and felt miserable. Some people have suggested X-ray, but I think I would get bored and have low job satisfaction.

I can‚Äôt seem to pull the trigger because I see nurses all over social media saying they hate nursing and that nursing has sucked the life out of them. My mother has worked hard and has had some bad nursing jobs but is now very happy with the opportunity she has now. My grandma is supportive of me going into nursing but explains that she has gotten punched in the face and seen some traumatic things. My mom has told me to be a x-ray tech.

Other than nursing, I have no idea what I would do. But I need something where I have a steady income and job security. Some other interests of mine are makeup, photography, and I love animals. I can‚Äôt see myself having a job in any of those though. I have thought about starting a business ex: laundry mat, coffee truck, drink shop.

I am so stuck and need advice before I waste more time not doing anything and becoming stagnant! Do any nurses like their job??",1,1760935182.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

1obastz,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1obastz/i_practiced_boredom_for_30_days_and_it_completely/,I practiced boredom for 30 days and it completely changed my life,"I was addicted to distraction. Phone while eating, podcast while walking, Netflix while cooking. I hadn't been alone with my thoughts in probably 5 years.

The moment silence hit, I'd panic and reach for something anything to fill the void.

Then I stumbled across research showing that our brains literally need boredom to function properly. Creative insights, problem-solving, even basic self-awareness all happen during mental downtime.

So I made myself a deal: 30 days of deliberately seeking boredom.

What I actually did:

Morning coffee with zero input. Just me, coffee, and whatever thoughts showed up. No scrolling, no news, no podcasts.

Walks without headphones. 15 minutes daily of just walking. And thinking. Or not thinking.

Meals as meals. Food and silence. That's it. Absolutely brutal at first.

Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks. No more scrolling on the toilet. Just sitting there and doing nothing.

5-minute wait rule. Before grabbing my phone when bored, I'd wait 5 minutes and see what happened. Most of the times I didn't scroll at it.

Day 3: I almost quit

My brain felt like it was vibrating. I was anxious, irritable, couldn't focus. I kept reaching for my phone and finding nothing there. It was like digital withdrawal.

Day 8: Something shifted

During my boring walk, I randomly remembered this song my dad used to play when I was a kid. Then I started thinking about calling him. Then I actually did call him. Best conversation we'd had in months.

That's when I realized my brain had been too cluttered to access my own memories.

Day 12: The idea came

I solved a work problem that had been driving me crazy for weeks. Just out of nowhere while washing dishes in silence. Then I got an idea for a side project. Then another one. I realized solutions come to us when we let our brains rest.

It was like my brain had been waiting for permission to think.

Day 18: I looked forward to being bored

This was the weirdest part. I started craving those quiet moments. My morning coffee ritual became sacred. The silent walks felt like therapy. I was happy to be alone and peaceful.

Day 25: Everything felt different

Colors seemed brighter. Food tasted better. Conversations were deeper because I was actually present instead of thinking about what to check on my phone next.

What actually changed:

I remembered who I was. Turns out I have opinions, preferences, and ideas that aren't influenced by whatever algorithm I'd been feeding my brain.

My sleep improved dramatically. When your mind isn't constantly stimulated, it actually knows how to rest. Who knew?

I became a better friend. Really listening to people instead of waiting for my turn to talk changed everything. Friends started coming to me with real problems, not just surface-level chat.

Work became easier. Problems that used to stress me out suddenly had obvious solutions. My brain had space to actually process things.

I got genuinely excited about stuff again. When you're not constantly consuming content, small things become interesting. I spent 20 minutes watching birds the other day and loved every second.

30 days later:

I still use my phone, but it doesn't use me. I still watch Netflix, but I also stare at walls sometimes. And those wall-staring sessions often end up being the best part of my day.

The person I was avoiding with all that distraction turned out to be someone worth knowing.

Try eating one meal today without any entertainment. Just you and your food. See what shows up in your head.

Your brain is way more interesting than your phone.",59,1760935088.0,motivation,8,1.0,False

Dear _____, 

I think writing has become a bit of a lost art lately. It‚Äôs quite rare seeing someone receive a letter in the mail nowadays. Everyone just texts how they feel but it seems so boring. Maybe I‚Äôm just a guy with a old heart, or maybe I just think a little too much, hahaha. But I‚Äôll write to you. I find myself thinking about you more than I should. No, no, no not in a bad way. I just catch myself wondering if you‚Äôd like it here, or if I could finally get a nice picture of us together to use as our contact picture. Maybe one as nice as the picture we have together at the Color Factory ( Oh, how I love that picture. ) I wonder if you would enjoy all of these coffee shops with me or if I ever cross your mind like you cross mine. I went to a museum today and saw a painting of the crucifixion. I couldn‚Äôt help but remember our Bible studies and how your little toes tap when you work out. These last two months have been so much fun, but time is moving a bit too fast. Honestly, I wish I could slow it down for just a bit, as it always seems to move so fast when you‚Äôre around. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I‚Ä¶ that I miss you. (And yes, before you question it. I do. I really do miss you. <3) And if you were a season, you‚Äôd be fall. As there‚Äôs something peaceful about you, like the calm when leaves begin to slowly fall one by one. How walks embrace you with comfort, as the leaves crunch with each step you take. Even when it‚Äôs a bit cold at night, there‚Äôs still warmth whenever you‚Äôre around. And just like fall, you never really change. Always as beautiful as the first day i saw you. Ohhh, I wish I could write forever, but there would never be enough words to piece together what I want to say. Maybe in person it would‚Äôve been better, but I could never form the right words to truly express myself. 
It is only now, that distance has made me realize how much someone can truly mean to you. ____ I honestly like it when you wear your hair down, it always looks so nice. I like how it pieces you together and how you carry yourself. I like how you wear sambas instead of vans after we went shopping together and how you sniff me from time to time hahaha. I may not say it but I'm proud of you and I thank God we met. I could never tell you this in person because I get a little nervous and stumble over my words.

1obasea,https://i.redd.it/byjtut2047wf1.jpeg,Carolyn quitting her job at CK‚Äî was it John‚Äôs idea?,"There‚Äôs a lot written about Carolyn being unemployed and miserable after marriage, to the point that she kept herself occupied with other people‚Äôs problems and lives. Carolyn quit her job at CK in April/May 1996.

I came across a few quotes from books and articles I wanted to share about this topic.

The first is from John‚Äôs friend from Brown University, Christa d‚ÄôSouza. She said, ‚ÄúJohn told me he was the one who had persuaded her to leave her job at Calvin Klein. One minute she was 'his [Calvin's] muse,' he explained,
'the next, the person who made the coffee.'‚Äù.

Then there‚Äôs this comment from John during the April 1997 White House Correspondents' Association dinner:

‚ÄúAs for the job hunt Bessette-Kennedy is supposedly conducting, she shook her head. ""I can't comment on that."" Kennedy interrupted his conversation with someone else to say, ""I won't let her!"" Asked about his dominance on the topic, she laughed and rolled her eyes in amusement.‚Äù

Carolyn‚Äôs close friend from CK, Joe McKenna, said this in an interview for People magazine: ‚ÄúCarolyn missed having her own career, she thought a lot about going back to work. It was hard for her, because she felt the press was always watching. One option she was exploring  was film school.‚Äù

Carolyn was even hanging out at CK after she quit and someone met her there in September 1997! Here‚Äôs a anecdote shared by a woman named Tara:

‚ÄúIn September of 1997, I was working for Neiman Marcus. My dear friend Lauren Ashby Holmes was modeling with Elite at the time. She kindly invited me to join her for a CK shoot she would be doing for their Milan campaigns. During the mid to late 90s, Calvin Klein, was the place to be. Whether it was at the headquarters, flagship, events... you could see everyone from Jennifer Aniston to Mark Wahlberg on any given day. But that afternoon one person stood out amongst them all, Carolyn Bessette- Kennedy. I do not believe she was employed for Calvin Klein anymore. Lauren, who also was on staff at CK, had told me that she had to leave most of her life behind due to constant paparazzi interference. I was told she would often come to visit - perhaps to escape the circus her life had become after marrying JFK Jr.

At first I didn't take much notice of this tall, lithe blonde sitting in the corner paging through Paris Match. I just assumed she was another model preparing for her own shoot. It was only after Lauren asked me ""would you like to meet Carolyn Bessette Kennedy?"" that I realized she wasn't simply another girl waiting for her makeup and hair to be attended to...
Typically I was not one to get nervous around high profile people. Yet when I was walking over with my friend I became increasingly on edge. Despite being a staunch conservative the Kennedy's mythological status transcended mortal partisanship.

My unease was calmed instantly. She could not have been more gracious, humble nor welcoming. I sat with her for about 30 minutes while Lauren had her polaroids taken. The conversation between us was easy and relaxed. We quickly learned about a few mutual acquaintances. My manager at Neiman's happened to be an old friend of Carolyn‚Äôs and she knew of my brother Michael. He was soon to become an assistant D.A in Manhattan, so through her husband they ran in the same circles. She gave me a hug when I left and that was the first and only time I met her in person.""

According to Richard Blow, he wrote in his book that Carolyn wanted to work at George: 

‚ÄúCarolyn tried relentlessly to get her husband to appoint her as George's fashion editor and drove a wedge between John and George co-founder Michael Berman. When Michael finally took John aside and asked him to please make his wife quit her self-sell act for a job she wasn't ever going to get, John went ballistic. The two squared off and were about to punch it out when John stopped and said, 'Is this uncool or what?' Kennedy and Berman then shook hands, but the bond between them was forever broken.""

In Sons of Camelot by Laurence Leamer, one of John‚Äôs female friends told Carolyn, ‚ÄúYou know, girl, you need to go out and get a job, you need to go out and work.""

""But I've got to take care of John,"" Carolyn replied.

‚ÄúExcuse me, was John walking into walls before you met him?"" There was a problem when a friend felt compelled to say such things, doubly a problem because John couldn't say it himself. ""Yeah, yeah, tell her, but don't let her know I know about this,"" he told his friend.

Sasha Chermayeff also shared ‚ÄúJohn was always saying to me, ""Carolyn could do anything she wants. Suck it up. Get your shit together."" He said to me at North Moore in the kitchen, ""If you were married to me, wouldn't there be all kinds of stuff you'd want to just do with your life? You're just going to sit around kvetching and being too neurotic to go outside?"" He wasn't so graceful about it‚Äîhe did lack compassion when it came to that.‚Äù

After reading all this, it sounds like it was John‚Äôs idea for Carolyn to leave CK, and she did so at his encouragement. I think she later regretted that decision, but by then it was too late to build a new career while also being ‚ÄúMrs. JFK Jr.‚Äù She clearly missed her old life which is why she was spending time at her old job in 1997.  Carolyn had always been a hard worker, holding retail jobs in high school, waitressing in college, then working for the Lyons Group in Boston, and eventually spending eight years at Calvin Klein. I understand that it would have been complicated for her to find another position in fashion given the potential conflicts with George magazine‚Äôs fashion advertisers. I suppose she saw working for her husband‚Äôs magazine as a fashion editor as the closest she could get to staying in the fashion world. When that didn‚Äôt work out, she considered film school and making documentaries, but that path went nowhere. Eventually, she began thinking about pursuing a master‚Äôs degree in psychology at Columbia, but she put that idea on hold shortly before she died.

Do you think it was unfair of John to ask her to quit her job and then later complain to his friends about his wife being unemployed? ",6,1760935052.0,JohnAndCarolyn,1,0.88,False

Dear _____, 

I think writing has become a bit of a lost art lately. It‚Äôs quite rare seeing someone receive a letter in the mail nowadays. Everyone just texts how they feel but it seems so boring. Maybe I‚Äôm just a guy with a old heart, or maybe I just think a little too much, hahaha. But I‚Äôll write to you. I find myself thinking about you more than I should. No, no, no not in a bad way. I just catch myself wondering if you‚Äôd like it here, or if I could finally get a nice picture of us together to use as our contact picture. Maybe one as nice as the picture we have together at the Color Factory ( Oh, how I love that picture. ) I wonder if you would enjoy all of these coffee shops with me or if I ever cross your mind like you cross mine. I went to a museum today and saw a painting of the crucifixion. I couldn‚Äôt help but remember our Bible studies and how your little toes tap when you work out. 
These last two months have been so much fun, but time is moving a bit too fast. Honestly, I wish I could slow it down for just a bit, as it always seems to move so fast when you‚Äôre around. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I‚Ä¶ that I miss you. (And yes, before you question it. I do. I really do miss you. <3) And if you were a season, you‚Äôd be fall. As there‚Äôs something peaceful about you, like the calm when leaves begin to slowly fall one by one. How walks embrace you with comfort, as the leaves crunch with each step you take. Even when it‚Äôs a bit cold at night, there‚Äôs still warmth whenever you‚Äôre around. And just like fall, you never really change. Always as beautiful as the first day i saw you. Ohhh, I wish I could write forever, but there would never be enough words to piece together what I want to say. Maybe in person it would‚Äôve been better, but I could never form the right words to truly express myself. 
It is only now, that distance has made me realize how much someone can truly mean to you. ____ I honestly like it when you wear your hair down, it always looks so nice. I like how it pieces you together and how you carry yourself. I like how you wear sambas instead of vans after we went shopping together and how you sniff me from time to time hahaha. I may not say it but I'm proud of you and I thank God we met. I could never tell you this in person because I get a little nervous and stumble over my words. But I like you. sniff... sniff... is that flowers I smell? Ohhh, you smell so so soooo good.",2,1760935018.0,letters,1,1.0,False
1obar9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1obar9p,Seeking advice on plateau. Please be kind,"I wanna start by saying, I know weight loss is calories in, calories out.   I know if the scale isn't moving then you are eating too much.  However, I am seeking advice because this is getting frustrating 


I'm a guy, 5'9.  Starting weight 262.  Current weight 219/221.    

It was coming off fast for the longest time.  Then, I became very ...(hate to say) depressed?   Life events.  Family issues. Self worth issues. I understand thats a different topic.  I would restrict myself out of self hate so much, I'd eat once a day.  And go occasionally up to 3 days no food.    

Most of my days consist of an iced coffee (no swirls, just sugar free shots at dunkin)   no food for 20 hours. And one meal at night. Normally being prepackaged chicken that I microwave.   I made a post on here a while ago and people were concerned I wasnt eating enough. 

My best friend of 16 years got engaged and she cut me off completely due to ""respect"" to her fianc√©. I shared more intimate private personal things with her than anybody. And that really broke me. Most of the time im not hungry.  

I was exercising DAILY.  I, now, have no energy. Barely enough to wake up and go to work.  I dont workout anymore.  

My question though.  My weight is staying stagnant.  Some days its 221. Other days its 218.  But im not seeing it flush below 218. And its been roughly 4-7 weeks.   It's not going higher. But its staying this low. 

I know its calories in calories out. I know I should exercise more.  I know everyone's going to say ""youre eating too much""  

But. Any advice on how to get this plateau fixed?

Anyway, the keyboard is working fine, (magnetic switches are still very reactive and as sensitive as they were before, besides some switches being a bit sloshy cuz of the coffee). The main issue currently is the rgb being broken, non responsive to any changes I make on the program for the keyboard (the rgb is stuck on the same RGB pattern it had when it first turned on). Is there anything I could try that could possibly fix the rgb being unable to be customized? I also reset the keyboards onboard settings to the factory default settings and then imported my previous config that I had.

So we‚Äôve just moved out, paid up to $980 for the whole house cleaning and carpet wash (bond back guarantee)

REA has come back to with whole list of issue with cleaning which can be rectified by the cleaners. but there are some other issue thats concerning and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle it.

Profile:

So this house is about 5-6 years old. We were the second tenants, and we‚Äôve lived here for 4 years now. The living room furnitures (TV unit, couch coffee table and dining) came with the house and we didn‚Äôt ask for them.

REA ‚ÄùIn my opinion, your cleaner has not done a satisfactory job, particularly with the carpets and walls. There are still visible stains that should have been properly treated.

The landlord and I have discussed this matter, and if the stains cannot be removed through proper cleaning, the cost of carpet replacement may exceed the bond amount.‚Äù

As I mentioned previously the cleaning issues can be rectified. I haven‚Äôt replied yet as I‚Äôm not sure how to handle the rest of it. Any advice would be valuable. Thank you!

Before we had kids, before we had money, we had no dishwasher. All dishes were washed by hand. Because of this, we would often use the same cup all day. Sometimes we would drink coffee out of a mug, rinse it, and it would be the water cup for the day. Toast for breakfast? Brush off the crumbs and use the plate again for the next meal. Dessert after dinner‚Äîuse the same stuff. Store food on the pot you cooked it in‚Äîno Tupperware to wash. Rinse your utensils and use those again too. Yeah, it was probably gross. But it minimized the amount of dishes two busy students had to clean. 

Now we have a dishwasher. Everything gets used once, and put in the dishwasher. Need another plate because you just finished eating and decided you want something else? It‚Äôs fine. Use a million spoons while cooking? It will just go in the dishwasher. There‚Äôs no hesitation in using as many dishes and utensils as you want. They all go into the dishwasher. The dishwasher is easily doing quadruple the amount of dishes we would have used had we no dishwasher. And we think nothing of the massive increase in dirty dishes because they are magically done for us. It costs us the same time and money to do a wash with a single spoon as a full load, so who cares?

And then I realized, I‚Äôm an appliance, a dishwasher. My husband does not hesitate to make a mess. No one doubts that dinner will be on the table, broken things will be fixed, groceries bought, returns done, plants watered, closets organized, everything cleaned, beds made, laundry done, clothes mended, bills paid, paperwork filed, parcels mailed, deliveries sorted, holiday decorations up, costumes purchased, or has to think twice about anything that is needed to keep a household running and clean and organized, because I am the appliance that will just quietly and endlessly do it. He can just continue living, not giving a second thought to the amount of work being generated, or the amount of work being done, because HIS amount of work is static, no matter the situation. Anytime there is a shift in the burden of housework, like moving, guests, a broken door or wall, a holiday, it ends up being only my problem. Because he gets to put one or 100 dishes in the dishwasher, press the start button, and it‚Äôs all the same to him. 

Except I‚Äôm a person. ",15,1760934060.0,breakingmom,2,1.0,False
