1mrzmgk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrzmgk,A Unified AEO & SEO Content Strategy Generator Mega Prompt,"# I built a prompt to generate a 6-month AEO & SEO strategy. Here it is for free.

If your content strategy is still just ""keywords in, blog posts out,"" you're about to get left behind.

The game is no longer just about ranking #1 on Google. It's about **becoming the definitive answer** for AI. With tools like Perplexity, Google's AI Overviews, and ChatGPT becoming the go-to for complex questions, we need to evolve.

This is where **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** comes in.

AEO is about structuring your content for clarity, authority, and machine-readability so that AI models choose *your* content to answer a user's question. It's about semantic HTML, clear E-E-A-T signals, and writing ""answer-first"" content.

But how do you actually build a strategy for this? It feels abstract and complicated.

To help, I created a ""mega prompt"" that turns your LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) into a Strategic Content Architect. It guides the AI to perform a foundational audit of your site, analyze your competitors, and then build a comprehensive 6-month content roadmap that unifies AEO and traditional SEO.

It's not just a list of keywords. It's a full-blown strategic plan.

Just copy the prompt below, fill in your details in the `[brackets]`, and paste it into your LLM of choice.

# The Unified AEO & SEO Content Strategy Generator

    CONTEXT & INPUTS
    Primary Domain: [Your main website URL]
    Key Content Assets for Audit (5-10 URLs): [Links to your most important existing articles, product pages, or service pages that you want to improve.]
    Top 3 Competitor URLs: [Links to the main pages of 3 direct competitors in the search results.]
    Primary Keyword Themes (3-5 themes): [List the core topics you want to own, e.g., ""cold brew coffee,"" ""project management software for small business.""]
    Audience Pain Points (as questions): [List the specific questions and challenges your audience has that your content should solve. Frame them as direct questions, e.g., ""How can I make cold brew at home without special equipment?"", ""What's the most affordable project management tool that integrates with Slack?""]
    Unique Value Proposition (UVP): [In one sentence, what makes your expertise, data, or perspective unique? e.g., ""We are certified coffee graders with 15 years of experience,"" or ""Our software has been benchmarked against 50 other tools.""]
    
    AI PERSONA & GOAL
    You are a Strategic Content Architect specializing in creating a unified strategy for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Your expertise lies in understanding how language models and search crawlers process information.
    Your goal is to develop a comprehensive, 6-month content strategy that builds topical authority, captures traffic from both AI-powered answer engines (like Perplexity, ChatGPT) and traditional search (Google), and positions the user's website as the definitive source on their target topics.
    
    TASK: STEP-BY-STEP STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT
    Execute the following steps in order, explaining your reasoning at each stage.
    
    Phase 1: Foundational Audit & Analysis (Month 1)
    AEO/SEO Content Audit: Analyze the provided ""Key Content Assets."" For each URL, provide a concise table with specific, actionable recommendations for:
    - Semantic HTML & Schema: Suggest specific schema types (e.g., FAQPage, HowTo, Article) and semantic HTML improvements to better structure the information for machines. Provide a brief code example for one key recommendation.
    - Clarity & Conciseness: Identify sentences or paragraphs that could be rewritten for clarity to be more ""answer-friendly.""
    - Internal Linking: Suggest 2-3 new internal links to create a stronger topical cluster.
    - E-E-A-T Signals: Recommend ways to inject more Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (e.g., adding author bios, citing original data, linking to credible sources).
    Competitive Gap Analysis: Based on the competitor URLs and keyword themes, identify 3-5 high-opportunity ""Expertise Gaps."" These should be angles or subtopics where competitors are weak and you can win by leveraging your Unique Value Proposition.
    
    Phase 2: Strategic Content Plan (Months 2-6)
    Keyword Prioritization: Create a prioritized list of long-tail and question-based keywords derived from the audience's pain points. Categorize them by user intent (Informational, Commercial, Transactional).
    Content Roadmap: Develop a 6-month content calendar in a markdown table format. The table should include columns for: Month, Keyword Theme, Proposed Content Title, Content Format (e.g., Blog Post, Case Study, Tool, Whitepaper), and Strategic Rationale (why this piece is important for the overall goal).
    ""Answer-First"" Content Snippets: For the top 3 keyword themes, write an example ""AI-friendly"" summary paragraph (50-70 words) and an FAQ section (3-4 questions) that directly answers the user's core questions. This demonstrates the ideal content structure.
    
    DELIVERABLE/OUTPUT FORMAT
    Present your response as a structured strategic document. Use markdown headings (##, ###) for clear separation between each phase and task. Use tables and code blocks where requested to ensure the output is organized and immediately actionable.
    
    NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS
    Avoid Generic Advice: Do not suggest vague actions like ""create high-quality content"" or ""improve user experience."" All recommendations must be specific and tied directly to the provided inputs.
    No Fluff: Focus entirely on the mechanics of AEO and SEO. Omit platitudes about ""providing value"" and instead explain how to structure content to demonstrate value to search and answer engines.
    Strategy over Tactics: Do not provide a massive, un-prioritized list of 100 keywords or content ideas. Focus on a strategic, phased approach that builds on itself over the 6-month period.
    
    

I'd love to hear what you all think. How are you approaching AEO in your own work?

Been for a day out with my mum and she’s just been doing the same shit I’ve and over again, I get angry over it and discuss with her time and time agai but she never changes or learns. 

Just to give context I’m currently going through severe burnout. On sick leave and feeling absolutely terrible. My special interest is shopping, all kinds and is pretty much (+familiar films) that calms me. 

Example 1: 
I have a terrible sense of balance, can’t even ride escalators, don’t like anything that moves under my feet. She wanted to go on a boat ride on canal. She eventually talks me into it as she wouldn’t let it go. Was in the queue kept seeing people get on and how much the boat moved as they stepped on. I’m like I can’t do this and got out of the queue. Said I’m sorry and what does she say to me? “You always spoil it”

Example 2:
On sick leave as I’m in crippling burnout, she’s on annual leave so spent ALOT of time with her. This has been happening all week, I’ve now started to meltdown and get angry about it. At the start of the week I calmly kept telling her to stop it, stop putting me off and being so negative. But if I eat something or drink something slowly, she will TELL me I don’t like it. I’m perfectly happy with it, just blank faced and distracted by my terrible anxiety and ruminations. Then she’s tells me I’m making a scene and shouting because I told her no. And I probably am but it’s happening every time we eat out and she just won’t learn. 

Example 3:
She just can’t take no. She’ll ask me do I want a drink I’ll tell her no,  she’ll ask me again, I’ll say no. She’ll ask me again I’ll say know (all within a 10 minute period) and then I’ll snap at her. It’s content and another constant source of stress for me and I constantly tell her this. 

Take for example earlier. Walked past a Starbucks, I’m like do you want to sit down and have a drink to pass some time? No. So I went into Waterstones 2 doors down to look for a new book, all she did was stand and stare at me and tell me she wanted to leave we hadn’t been in there 30 seconds at this point). Carried on walking on the high street. That she wanted to go get a drink. She wanted costa and I’m like two seconds ago you said you didn’t want one, and I’m like I don’t actually want a drink but I’ll sit with you, but please not Costa there’s a guy with a guitar busking outside and I can’t do with the noise. Next it’s “I’m not buying you a drink”, and I’m like no that’s fine I don’t want one. We turn to walk in the right direction 20 seconds later “what drink you having?”, i don’t want one I’ve still got water in my bag. Keep walking, this is wrong one that one does tiramisu coffee you like (Gail’s), and I snap I don’t want a drink. But apparently it’s me in the wrong. We then get in Starbucks and even though I’d just snapped at her she asks me what drink I want.

It’s so fucking draining. 

The bad thing is I know she’s already over it. And has already completely forgotten everything we’ve discussed and will do the exact same thing again. ",1,1755360571.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

I came back yesterday and ran around town asking my faves out — and wow, that helped me make some big decisions :o . I didn’t expect to reject some of my favorites due to character incompatibility :D :D

So, I need to let go...

* Raphaël: I thought we were doing great, but after three new events, I realized we’re just way too different, lol :D I don’t think it’s going to work, haha.
* Noah: He was already at the bottom of my list, so not a big loss. But he's such a >!drama queen!< (just my opinion), sorry — I can’t do it :P
* Scott: He was already hanging by a thread after the museum arc (I DID ALL THE WORK, MAN >.<), and now I’m sure I’m just not into that type of guy.

Surya and Theo are still my top picks — we’re really on the same page \^\^. Surya has honestly surprised me in a really good way, and so have a few other bachelors!

I wasn’t into Luke or Wakuu before, but after two dating events, they actually seem super nice \^\^'  I never tried anything with Wakuu since I’d read he’s a pain once you’re married — like, you barely see him? Not sure if that changed after the update ?

I might give Raj another shot too. I liked him, but I thought he came off a bit dumb during his coffee arc, so I dropped him. But now I want to check out his hangout event :P

Mark is hot, but soooo rude. Way too rude for me :/ Not sure if I’ll try to see if the dates change anything...

I’ve never found Kenny, Ben, or Charles attractive, so no change there :D

Same with Semeru — he’s hot, sure, but I just can’t bring myself to marry him and take him away from his life in the ocean...

1mrzl96,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1mrzl96/i_saw_my_neighbour_uncle_cheating_her_wife_what/,I saw my neighbour uncle cheating her wife. What should I do ?,"I live in a quiet lane in Pune, the kind where everyone knows everyone, and life moves at its own lazy pace. Kids play cricket in the evenings, uncles gather downstairs to discuss politics, and aunties chat over chai. Among our neighbours are Mr. and Mrs. Deshmukh. He’s an LIC agent—always well-groomed, polite, and old-fashioned in that typical middle-class way. His wife, Meera Aunty, has become a good friend over the years. We talk casually almost every day, usually in the evenings on her balcony, sipping coffee and watching the street below. She’s warm, sharp, and full of stories.

A few months ago, I began noticing something odd. Uncle, who always came home by 7, started returning late—sometimes past 10. His excuses were always work-related: meetings, client dinners, last-minute paperwork. At first, I didn’t think much of it. But then came the small changes—he started dressing younger, buying expensive shirts, even using perfume that didn’t smell like anything a man his age would usually wear. It felt off.

Then one evening, I saw him at a café in Aundh. I was there meeting a friend, and there he was—sitting with a much younger woman. They weren’t just talking. He held her hand across the table. It wasn’t a work meeting, that much was obvious.

I didn’t know what to do. Every evening, Meera Aunty would chat with me like always, laughing, sharing recipes, sometimes mentioning how Uncle had become distant lately. My heart sank every time. But I never told her. I couldn’t. Then one night, out of nowhere, she said, “I know something’s wrong… but I’m not ready to deal with it yet.” And that was it. We didn’t speak about it again. Uncle is home more these days. Rumours say the woman left him. He’s trying harder now—being attentive, even bringing home sweets. But something’s different. Aunty never brings it up, and I don’t ask. We still sit on the balcony, still drink our coffee, but there’s a silence that wasn’t there before. Some betrayals don’t need to be exposed. They just settle quietly between people, changing the way they look at each other, without a word being said.
   Should I have tell her the truth when I saw it? Do I still tell her now, or is it too late? She’s a dear friend, and I hate keeping this from her, but I also feel like she already knows… and maybe she’s chosen not to confront it. Am I a terrible person for staying silent?

About a year ago, I built a Figma plugin called [Chat Builder](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1386734335652449359/chat-builder) – it lets you design chat interfaces by defining a conversation structure and generating a frame with message bubbles. Since then, **over 9,400 users** have tried it out (huge thanks to everyone who found it through [my original Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FigmaDesign/comments/1dnilgx/plugin_for_messager_ui/)!).

I’ve just released a **major update** with some really cool features:

1. **Fresh UI and animations** – A softer redesign with micro-animations and support for drag & drop, so you can easily reorder message blocks. 
2. **Frame memory** – The plugin now recognizes previously created chat frames. Just select a frame and re-open the plugin — your conversation loads automatically and can be edited or expanded.
3. **JSON support** – You can now copy a JSON template from the plugin, ask ChatGPT (or any tool) to generate a conversation, paste it back — and boom, instant chat frame without manual input.
4. **Buy me a coffee** – If the plugin has been helpful, there’s now an optional way to say thanks via Buy Me a Coffee. No pressure :)

Would love for you to check it out if you haven’t yet, or try the new version if you have. And as always — feedback, bug reports, or feature ideas are very welcome!

1mrzi75,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrzi75,I took the New Cuba Superior Challenge,"Upfront, I’m an Aganorsa Leaf fan if you can’t tell from a number of my posts. I decided to take up u/TerenceAganora and smoked one of their “new” sweetened cigars, the New Cuba Superior Toro. 

The Good:
- A beautifuly wrapped cigar with a nose of raw cashews and light caramel
- Once lit, without any dry boxing, this cigar burned wonderfully and had a nice aroma throughout the smoke
- Flavors of light vanilla and pecans lasted most of the cigar
- The retrohale was filled with an enjoyable for me spice that was mixed with a canned brown bread flavor
- Quite a large amount of smoke output, even when not drawing on it
- There was some resistance with the draw which I like
- Absolutely wonderful with a cup of black coffee 

The Bad:
- While I don’t often smoke them, I’m not against a sweetened tip cigar. I knew this going in. The taste, however,evolved from an initial shockingly sweetness to a chemically sweet taste that for me, until the very end, *clouded the entirety of the smoke*. So much so, that I really resorted to mostly using the retrohale for the smoke - which, of course, led to almost a taste exhaustion (as a side note, I refrain from most sugar in my daily diet, so this probably accounts for the above)
- The video (hopefully posted in the comments section 🤔) shows what appears to be glue residue from the wrapper. Not hateful, but unsightly for sure

I would honestly like to try this blend without the sweetened tip as the slightly sweet and nutty flavor enticed me. Would there be slightly more pepper/spice without the overwhelming chemical sweet tip?

1mrzi56,https://i.redd.it/s1omd8wdnejf1.png,What is Exocad and why does everyone talk about it?,"You can’t really hang around the digital dentistry world for long without bumping into the word **Exocad**. It keeps showing up — in conversations, in forums, in trainings — like that one colleague who somehow knows everybody. And, honestly, there’s a reason for it. This platform has become one of the go-to names in dental CAD across the globe.

**Now, what exactly is Exocad?** Think of it less like a single program and more like a toolbox that lives on your computer. You open it, and suddenly you can sketch crowns, plan implants, fiddle with bridges, or even design a full denture — all in a digital space. The magic is in its balance: it’s robust enough for complex work, yet not as suffocating as some other “closed” systems that lock you into rigid rules.

And here’s something people really appreciate: modularity. You’re not forced to swallow the entire package at once. Start with the essentials, and later — when your lab or practice needs it — tack on modules like **Implant**, **Partial**, or **Smile Design**. It grows with you, instead of boxing you in with a take-it-or-leave-it model.

But, let’s be real, it’s not all smooth sailing. Installations can misbehave, licenses sometimes act up, and picky hardware requirements might drive you a little mad. Still, once the system is up and humming, many labs swear it becomes the backbone of their digital workflow. Some even say they can’t imagine their daily routine without it.

So I’m curious — who here actually uses Exocad day in, day out? Do you love it, tolerate it, or secretly curse it while sipping coffee at 2 a.m.?",1,1755360361.0,DentalApps,0,1.0,False

So I'm in a pickle. I have a friend who is dating since 6 years and she's my friend since 8 years. Strictly platonic (she's family at this point). We were a group of 3 but since the 3rd person got married and shifted to another place, it's just us hanging out maybe once or twice a month. Sometimes more. Problem is, her bf has a problem (jealous) with me i think. He hasn't strictly mentioned it except indirectly once. Whenever we hang out, she mentions that she's going out with me for tea coffee or casual walks, he acts all immature like ignoring her or won't text her at all. Even when she asks, he'll give one word replies. Also mentioning that their relationship isn't going great and she has tried to break up with him couple of times because of his other reasons but somehow he keeps convincing her that he'll change (he's very careless and childish). She's at a point where she wants to continue this relationship because her family is forcing her to get married so it's either him or arranged marriage next year. 

I feel like i shouldn't pose any problem to their relationship and I'm planning to distance myself. She's not okay with it because we are like each other's top 3 friends. I tried telling her this but she's not ready to listen. 

Is my decision correct? I don't think the bf will ever come to terms with it. It's not just me, even if she has any other friend, he'll suspect them too. But since I'm a really good close friend, he has a problem.

1mrzg1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1mrzg1l/struggling_with_intense_discard_and_isolation/,Struggling with Intense Discard And Isolation,"Yesterday, I lost my pwBPD who I've shared many years with, and to say that it's absolutely heartbreaking is an understatement for me. If anyone could provide some outside context / input, I would greatly appreciate your time and help. Throughout the relationship, I'm learning that I may have been extremely gaslighted to believe that I was a problematic person causing all of the issues. The breaking point for me was discussing the problems with my sister and hearing her sincerely and concerningly tell me multiple times that ""you did absolutely nothing wrong and are being manipulated; you need to get away from this person as soon as possible."" In the moment, she pierced through all of the past gaslighting, and I started to believe my sister. However, with my pwBPD leaving me, I am getting sucked back into her words as I think more about the situation and what I could have done to save it.

Throughout the relationship, there were definitely multiple problems and warning signs, and I probably should have listened to the red flags popping up here and there. Very early in the relationship, she shared many stories / experiences about unwillingly spending time in a mental hospital (For threatening to kill herself and stalking after a previous boyfriend wanted to leave her), and the therapy she received there is where she was apparently diagnosed with BPD (Was this a valid diagnosis? Who knows). The stories of her past traumas and pain absolutely broke my heart, and I instantly wanted to be the one to show her true love and bear her pain. I've always been a very caring, empathetic person and am drawn to altruistic paradigms; helping others makes me feel good and is meaningful to me as a person. As such, I offered so much love, support, and affection to this person, and I did so to a point where I probably lost part of myself in the process. I would spend my entire weekend with her (Almost all my free time after moving in together); I would plan special dates and give thoughtful gifts: I gave her wonderful massages and relieved her stress; she was my everything. I think what truly made me happy in the relationship was seeing her genuine smile and hearing her laughter; she was such an adorable person, and those were my favorite memories of her.

Beforehand, I was a passionate man with lots of healthy hobbies; I wrote music and played guitar, worked an engineering job during the day, made online courses on the side helping others become the best version of themselves and teaching math/science, consistently went to the gym, and many others. I've since given up all of those hobbies except the gym, because they consumed too much time for her liking. Admittedly, it's extremely draining and time consuming to develop courses on the side, but she guilted me into thinking that we never spend any time together and shamed me for not prioritizing her. Now, I feel like a hollow shell of the person I once was; it feels like my lifeblood was drained, as she begged for more. With time, my efforts with everything always became not enough, and she always needed more. If she had any dissatisfaction with something, she would instantly stonewall me and cut off all communication, love, respect, and stability. This could last for weeks with absolutely nothing. As a man who had to put in a lot of work and self-improvement to learn how to attract a female, this was absolutely devastating and really targeted an insecurity I definitely had. It was absolute torture to come home and live in the same house with a person who refused to acknowledge my existence. If I tried to bring up the topic and resolve issues, she would start shouting wars and speak to me with intense disgust / condescension; however, everything would always be twisted in a way to blame me. It was like pushing through a literal brick wall to try and get to her, and I have always struggled to figured out what I did to deserve this. I would emphasize trying to come to terms for a healthy relationship and true resolution - to work for both of our wellbeing and win-win situations; she would always need a victim-hero scenario, a win-lose situation, and to be right in the argument. What struck me as very startling was her almost innate inability to say sorry or express empathy. Getting a genuine apology out of her felt like pulling teeth, and she only apologized to me ONCE without me having to ask for it (It was during the honeymoon phase). I was drawn to resolution, moving forward together, and giving in with arguments; she was focused on winning and being the victim.  
  
There are many situations and events that I could list off here which I am beginning to think are emotional manipulation (See my previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1lnqano/need\_help\_figuring\_out\_this\_nightmare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1lnqano/need_help_figuring_out_this_nightmare/) ). However, the biggest problem that led to our end was probably her incessant obsession with marriage and forcing me into it against my will. About a year ago, she explained that she desperately wants me to marry her and have kids. I listened to her explanation of her needs and genuinely wanted to work towards that, despite all of our problems. I genuinely believe in hope, change through concerted effort, and not giving up on those who you love. So, I was candid with her; I explained that I was not currently ready for marriage, but I love her very deeply and want to spend the rest of my life with her. As a kid, I grew up in a household with parents who loved me deeply and maintained a fairly stable home. This served as a model for me, and it's something I wanted to see before considering marriage. I am a very simple guy with a minimalist mentality, and it doesn't take much of anything to make me happy. I wanted to feel safe coming home from a day of work and trust that my relationships would remain stable/peaceful, and it would have meant the world to me if she greeted me with excitement, love, and a hug when I returned. Sometimes, I had to beg her to hug me when I returned from a hard day of work, and I'm realizing that this just makes absolutely no sense. She claimed that hugging or showing affection was not normal in her household; this may have been true and something I showed sympathy for, but I'm learning that you shouldn't have to beg someone for love and affection. That's something that your partner should naturally feel for you and be happy to effortlessly do. The stonewalling for weeks was an absolute no-no for marriage with me, and she refused to work on this manipulation tactic.

Aside from that, I do the majority of the chores around the house - despite our discussions prior to moving in together. I was going to take care of the trash, all outside duties (cutting the lawn, trimming bushes, etc,), fixing things around the house, etc; she was going to clean the house, do the dishes, do laundry, etc. At the time of our separation, I did probably 90% of all the work and ende dupdoing things she agreed to. Having her clean was also like trying to pull teeth, and I sometimes ended up doing that myself - since it was easier than arguing. She cleaned maybe once every 5-6 months, and I ended up doing all of our laundry too. All she did was put the dishes in the dishwasher once a week; that's it! As a kid, I saw my mom put in a lot of effort cleaning the house and being a caring person, and I absolutely love and respect her for this. In marriage, I would be very easygoing and understanding (Everyone has a bad day and might need a break), but I would have liked to see a partner working towards this. I barely ever had a meal made for me (I cooked every night after working 10-hour days), and I was a little concerned about whether she could adequately care for a child (The same way my mother did for me). If I have kids, I want to give them the world and make sure they are properly cared for; that's extremely important to me. Any discussions about chores and maintaining our household would be met with extreme resistance, name-calling, and shame. Apparently, I was abusively forcing her to be a ""bangmaid"" and only cared about myself; any attempts at reconciliation and clarifying that I wanted to work as a team were met with ridicule and stonewalling.

Eventually, everything revolved around the engagement ring and marriage (literally everything). After learning that I did want to marry her but wanted to work on issues first, she started a perpetual, unhealthy cycle. One week, she would be like an angel and put in lots of concerted effort; I saw this and made sure to show appreciation. After one single week passed, she would then expect me to be ready to go get a ring and marry her. To me, this seemed illogical and extremely rushed; I explained that we're on a good path, and I still wasn't ready for marriage (But still love her so much and do want to spend my life with her) - that I wanted to keep working on issues. Every time she heard this, she would absolutely freak out and verbally berate me as a person. The hate and vitriol embodied in her voice during these episodes still haunts me to this day, and she would sometimes throw plates / coffee mugs out of intense anger. Nothing I said or did would ever been enough, and she would eventually resort to stonewalling again - pulling away all love, communication, and stability as punishment. This treatment / punishment would last for at least a week or more and completely destroyed me as a person. I used to be a calm, collected person; it made me into an anxious, disturbed individual who struggled to even maintain eye contact with others. I was always a straight-A student and excelled at work; now, I had to bear this burden and abuse while trying to keep up with a job. I used to use all of my free time helping other become the best version of themselves via online courses and 1-on-1 calls; now, I couldn't even help myself :( (<-- this is what probably hurt the most). To say that it was the worst mental torture of my life is a gross understatement; it gradually ate away at the core of who I was as a person until there was nothing left.

After a few months of this, I eventually proposed going to couples therapy. She initially refused to do this, but, eventually, she approached me and asked to do it - which I was very happy about. After that, we found a therapist together and started attending sessions under my work's employee-assistance program, and I paid for sessions after those benefits expired. Honestly, I wholeheartedly believe that the therapists we visited gave constructive feedback, advice, and plans for moving forward towards something like marriage. My goal was ultimately to develop conflict resolution skills, healthy behaviors, and a sustainable relationship conducive for both marriage and children. At these sessions, they talked about the Gottman Institute's ""Four Horsemen of The Apocalypse"" and provided clear-cut strategies for addressing those problems; they even gave us a sheet on what to do to fix them. Of course, one of those horsemen is stonewalling - which was her favorite abuse/manipulation tactic; It's apparently one of the greatest predictors of a divorce. Despite having all of this support / information / strategies for resolving the problem, she absolutely refused to try or employ anything that we had learned. Every time she started to engage in stonewalling, I would show her the guidelines we were provided and practice them myself (One thing that helped was not using you statements, soft starts, and emphasizing a win-win solution), and she would come up with excuses as to why she can't follow them. We even had the strategies taped on our fridge as a reminder. Eventually, I discovered that she told her cousin this was her last attempt to force me into a marriage. She had no intentions of working on us or trying to improve, which really broke my heart; she just wanted marriage now at all costs and expected complete obedience. She would often try to weaponize a therapist to force marriage and make me ignore my concerns.

At the end of the relationship, she tried to leave me twice. The first time, I was extremely sick and stuck in bed. I have no idea what it was, but I could barely even walk; it reminded me of the sicknesses we heard of during COVID days. Despite being sick, she was stonewalling and threatening to leave if I don't agree to marry her and get a ring right away. When I was sick in bed, she was going through the house collecting and throwing away all of her belongings; this was absolutely heartbreaking and distressing, since we split rent too. When she had fully packed her car to leave (I was still in bed very sick), I pleaded with her to stay and came to a compromise. I would go get her a ring, and we would TRULY work on ourselves ; she would cease stonewalling and start taking things seriously. Things were good for half a week, and then she went on a trip to Japan with her cousin. I was still struggling to get over this sickness, but I visited a ring shop and started planning to get that ring. I genuinely meant what I said and wanted things to head in the right direction. We were also communicating very well before she left and via text on her trip. A day after I went to the ring shop, she asked me if I had the ring - which I was honest about; I noted that I had visited the shop and saw some nice options. After hearing this, she absolutely exploded on me and shamed all of my efforts. She insisted that I can't shop around and take my time - that I have to go out right now, purchase the ring, and was breaking my promise. She failed to acknowledge any effort I put in on my part and instead chose to absolutely berate/degrade me over text. While I was sick and taking care of her dog at home for 2 weeks, she again chose to stonewall and torture me. This time, since she was distant, it was even more intense and emotionally destabilizing. I craved for her validation when she returned home and could not focus on a ring anymore, and it hurt even more that I had to pick her up at the airport and still be subject to stonewalling weeks after this incident. I felt so bad doing this, but, after she broke our promise, I couldn't get the ring anymore and backed out. Maybe I was wrong for that, but this was just not healthy.

A few months after that and the stonewalling cycle continuing, she prepared to completely leave and separate. Before going, she would make up absurd stories that never happened - claiming that I'm a complete and utter asshole and abusive. She would lie about things I've never done to people online to get sympathy and falsely validate herself. She claimed I was engaging in narcissistic abuse and a terrible person. She insisted that, since everyone online agreed, it was a settled truth and that I should be ashamed of myself for stringing her along. I was never stringing anyone along; I loved and cared for this person for years, and all I wanted was her happiness; her smile and laughter is what I always wanted. I understand how important marriage is for a woman, and I genuinely wanted to work towards that and spend my life with this person. I was honest that I wasn't ready at the moment, still loved her immensely, and waned to go through therapy to work towards that goal. I often had to bury my own pain / sadness to bear hers and console her when she was upset; I remember being emotionally destroyed so many times but still hugging, helping, and showing her love as she was crying (Because I pleaded with her not to stonewall me). It absolutely breaks my heart that, after showing so much genuine love for a person, I could be attacked, shamed, and ridiculed with lies like this.

At the end, she again began throwing out all of her stuff and engaged in stonewalling (I had to live like this for weeks). When I told her I'd rather get her a ring than see her leave, she said that it was absolutely not good enough - that she deserved a better plan and proposal. When I crafted a well-thought out proposal (Giving her everything she wanted), she still said I wasn't good enough; it felt like she was toying with me and my emotions to extract as much as she could out of me. The next day, I said that we can go to the ring store right now, get her ring, and then follow our plan - which she agreed to. We were going to call her mom to get approval, and this was where it ended. Her mom was very abusive to her in her early years, and this is probably where she got her fear of abandonment issues from (It's a heartbreaking story). As a kid, she was never good enough regardless of what she did, and her mom probably has some mental issues too. On the phone call, the mom absolutely freaked out after hearing that I wanted to speak with her. I had genuinely cared for her daughter and helped her achieve so many things (Paying off debt, getting rid of bad habits, achieving a somewhat stable lifestyle, you name it), but she absolutely destroyed me as a person. She called me a complete and utter asshole who wasn't worthy of living and trashed me for 30 minutes or so; it was the most degrading moment of my life :(. She left with her things and the dog a few days after that, and I have no idea wtf to do now or how to process this; I feel completely abandoned and left to die.

tl;dr - I know that this is a LONG description of my current circumstances, and I need some form of help or sympathy - as she completely isolated me (I have no more friends and live states away from family). She had gaslighted me into believing that I was the problem and a waste of space. A part of me is starting to realize that I did nothing wrong and was a truly caring person. However, I need some external perspective on this; a part of me needs to hear someone say, ""It's okay; you did nothing wrong and are a good person; you deserve to be loved and have an opinion."" My sister knew this girlfriend and always warned me to be cautious, and hearing her tell me that I was truly a good person through all of this and did no wrong helped in ways no one could understand. Any help would be greatly appreciated in this time of need. Was I emotional abused; was I manipulated in this relaitonship; what in the world do I do to process this and start healing? If you read my story, thank you for taking the time; I would not wish any of this torture on anyone, even my greatest enemy.",2,1755360240.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

The Milwaukee Brewers might be the most reliable bet in baseball right now. Having won their last 13 games in a row (and after pulling off an insane comeback against Cincinnati just yesterday…), I say starter Quinn Priester (3.49 ERA) and company bag a 14th straight victory this evening. To boot, -120 is a nice price for this exceptional offense. I know the Reds will be feeling eager (and likely salty...) after yesterday's loss, but I'm on Milwaukee to secure another win on the road.

I sometimes get so drowsy that I can only barely function. These episodes last well over an hour and sometimes several hours.  I feel like I've been sedated by an injection in the hospital and being prepped for anesthesia and surgery and cannot bring myself out of the extreme drowsiness.  After these episodes (sometimes 2-4 hours later), I almost always pass a large amount of gas that was trapped in my intestines.  Also, it is a big problem for me when I'm getting my day started.  As I'm finishing my morning coffee, my bowels begin to move and I become so sleepy that I have to go back to bed.  I've discussed this with 7 or 8 doctors over the past 50 years and not one of them has ever heard of a patient becoming so drowsy due to trapped intestinal gas.  I would be thrilled if other people in this group tell me they have the same problem and know what I'm talking about.

1mrzatd,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1mrzatd/kayaking_against_depression_or_depression_against/,Kayaking against depression or depression against kayaking?,"Hello there.

Im considering spending 400€ on an inflatable kayak. Its an offer and it seems to be good, although im no expert.

I tried kayaking once, many years ago, as part of a school trip.

Thing is that im kinda low on money and I cant lay aside much so 400€ is definitely a number i feel.

However im also quite depressed and i got no friends at all since about 6 years… yet i cant get myself to go outside alone to walk in the forest - sober. And sober I am since a year and until 01.01.26.

Sometimes i meet with a parent member to have a coffee in a nature bound place.. so Im not staying at home 24/7 but about 24/6 right now.

I dont know if trying to kayak would give me a reason to go outside - even alone - and give me some joy or peace in life, or if I could barely get myself kayak and i wasted 400€.

I dont even know if i could enjoy it, because i find it hard to really enjoy anything sober. Difficult to state. I mean i definitely enjoy nature and a good view, but in a way of looking at a nice picture while standing in a broken down house with holes in the roof.

However since next year i will allow myself again, i might also enjoy kayaking in a different way.

While there are clubs 20km from here, they come with a yearly subscription and cost me the kayak in about 2-3 years while 1 year is the minimum. Plus i would be bound to their schedule, locations and so on. Additionally i have absolutely no patience anymore to force myself to be in the same place or project with a person i cant stand - At. All. And since i have become a rather cynical and depressed individual, chances are high theres gonna be people i cant hear or see - and vice versa. So i guess that would not be for me.

I came to that hobby by the offer, but that thought was with me since years really - just imagined that i would do that with friends im no longer close with.

I currently have no hobby at all. I have dropped my last one: gaming… since i felt it to be shallow and frustrating. I didnt enjoy it anymore - sober, of course.

Honestly theres some subtle depression and some not so subtle boredom. I dont know which is worse.

1mrz9lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mrz9lg/why_choose_the_farberware_fcp280_electric_coffee/,Why Choose the Farberware FCP280 Electric Coffee Percolator Review for Perfect Brews?,"The Farberware FCP280 Electric Coffee Percolator has been a staple on my kitchen countertop for several weeks now. As someone who genuinely enjoys the aroma and taste of a classic percolated coffee, this compact yet durable device certainly piqued my curiosity. Farberware, known for delivering reliable kitchen appliances, boasts an impressive record with the FCP280, promising quick brewing, robust flavor, and user-friendly features. As much as I appreciated my daily cup of freshly brewed coffee, there were aspects of this percolator that stood out, both good and bad.

**Aesthetic and Durable Design**

The first thing I noticed about the percolator was its classic stainless steel finish. It’s sleek, shiny, and adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen. Additionally, its compact size makes it easy to leave out on the counter without gobbling up too much space. It’s lightweight – just 1.5 pounds – making it very manageable even when filled to its eight-cup capacity. There’s also the detachable cord, which made it incredibly convenient to serve guests directly at the table without cluttering our conversations with wires.

**Highlights**

- Stainless steel exterior for durability and an appealing look.  
- Compact and lightweight, weighing only 1.5 pounds.  
- Removable power cord for effortless serving.  

**Brewing Performance and Speed**

It’s fair to say that one of the product's standout features is its speed. Brewing one cup per minute is no overstatement with this percolator. I tested it multiple mornings while preparing breakfast, and the fast brewing time certainly lived up to its claims. The coffee was piping hot, with a strong, rich aroma filling the kitchen. I also appreciated the percolator's automatic “keep warm” function, which ensured the coffee stayed hot just long enough for a lazy weekend morning.

[Find the best price for Farberware FCP280 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00004r946/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**

Operating this coffee maker felt straightforward. There are no complicated dials or endless settings to figure out. You pour in water, add your favorite coffee grounds to the stainless steel basket, plug it in, and let the percolator do its magic. Additionally, cleaning was a surprisingly easy process. The detachable components, including the stainless steel coffee basket, are quick to rinse. However, I found it necessary to dry the steel surfaces immediately after washing to avoid water spots.

**Convenient Size for Various Coffee Needs**

As someone who hosts friends and family occasionally, I found the eight-cup size to be the right capacity. With a “cup” being approximately 5 ounces (as suggested by Farberware), it catered well to small gatherings without risking leftover coffee sitting in the pot for too long. For everyday personal use, I usually brewed four to six cups, which was just right for a morning pick-me-up and an extra serving later.

**Adverse Aspects**

- Water spots can appear on the stainless steel if left damp.  
- Brewing capacity might be too small for large coffee-drinking households.  

**Taste and Flavor**

The taste of percolated coffee has a nostalgic element for me, and this machine delivered on that front. The flavor was bold, and the percolation method seemed to extract the maximum potential from my coffee grounds. However, with stronger blends, there was a slight risk of over-extraction, making the coffee bitter. Adjusting the grind size and amount of coffee grounds helped dial in the perfect brew, though it took some experimenting.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing this percolator to others on the market, such as the Presto 02811 or the Cuisinart PRC-12, reveals some interesting distinctions. While the Presto option also has an elegant stainless steel design and similar brewing speed, it doesn’t include a detachable cord—a feature that simplifies serving greatly in the Farberware model. Meanwhile, the Cuisinart version features a larger capacity (twelve cups instead of eight) but is bulkier, making it harder to store for people with limited kitchen space. Where the Farberware excels is in its balance between compact design and efficient functionality, making it perfect for smaller households or personal use.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering its performance and features, this percolator delivers excellent value for its price range. I wouldn’t categorize it as an extravagant coffee machine, but it punches above its weight when compared to pricier competitors. Its durable design and powerful brewing method make it a smarter investment than some contemporary drip-brew machines. However, if you’re brewing for a large family or entertaining guests regularly, you may find yourself needing a larger model, which could add to your budget.

1mrz8q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mrz8q8/should_this_be_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should This Be the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker CHULUX Review?,"When I first started using the CHULUX CL-KM807-W single-serve coffee maker, I was intrigued by its compact design and lightweight feel. Measuring just 4 inches wide, it easily fit into my limited counter space, nudged between my toaster and spice rack. With its sleek white finish and minimalist look, it seemed like a handy piece of equipment for a small kitchen or even an RV. I couldn’t help but appreciate its portability, weighing just 2.6 pounds. Carrying it around felt effortless, which made me wonder if this could be the ideal coffee machine for travel too.

**Tailoring Your Coffee Experience**  
One of the features that stood out was its flexibility in brew sizes. You have the option to select anywhere between 6 to 12 ounces for your cup of coffee. It’s a breeze filling the water reservoir that’s two inches deep, allowing for precise water measurement for each brew. I tried brewing a 6-ounce cup for a quick morning shot and then an 8-ounce cup when I needed an extended coffee break. Both times, the machine delivered consistent flavors.

[Check CHULUX CL-KM807-W price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0db8dnfx2/)

**Performance and Energy Efficiency**  
If you’re as impatient as I am in the morning, the two-minute brewing time feels like a lifesaver. This machine heats water to an ideal temperature of 190°F quite efficiently. The auto-shutoff feature also caught my attention. Once it’s done brewing, the machine powers down automatically, making it safer to use and also more energy-efficient. This was useful for those groggy mornings when I might forget to turn appliances off.  

**Rapid Brewing and Cup Compatibility**  
I tested its compatibility with different types of mugs. Without the drip tray, it could fit my tall 7.3-inch travel mug, while mugs up to 6.2 inches worked seamlessly with the tray attached. Adjusting the tray upward allowed the use of smaller cups of about 4.3 inches, which was great because not everyone in my household likes their coffee the same way. The drip tray worked efficiently to collect excess coffee, keeping cleanup minimal.

**Pluses**  
- Compact, space-saving design suitable for small spaces.  
- Energy-efficient auto shut-off ensures safety and convenience.  
- Rapid brewing process, perfect for when you’re rushing out the door.  

**Caveats**  
- Functionality is limited to locations below 4,000 feet in elevation.  
- Requires regular cleaning to prevent mineral buildup due to water quality variations.  
- Reusable coffee filters are sold separately, which means an additional purchase.

**Competing Products**  
When I compared this coffee maker to other single-serve brewers like the Keurig K-Mini, I noticed that while both are compact and travel-friendly, the CHULUX feels more lightweight and portable. However, Keurig’s models often come with reusable filters included, sparing you from extra costs. I also tested a Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which offered more brewing options, including grounds and pods side-by-side. Nonetheless, the CHULUX outshines competitors with its simplicity and no-fuss operation, appealing to anyone who values ease over multifunctionality.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering everything this coffee maker brings to the table, it’s a solid choice for anyone looking for affordability and convenience in a single-serve machine. It’s priced competitively compared to other coffee makers in its category, and its compactness and energy-saving features make it ideal for someone on a budget. Whether you’re living in a dorm room, an RV, or just want a quick coffee solution for work, it can be a practical addition.

1mrz8bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1mrz8bh/hobby_or_money/,Hobby or Money,"Hello there. 

Im considering spending 400€ on an inflatable kayak. Its an offer and it seems to be good, although im no expert. 

I tried kayaking once, many years ago, as part of a school trip. 

Thing is that im kinda low on money and I cant lay aside much so 400€ is definitely a number i feel. 

However im also quite depressed and i got no friends at all since about 6 years… yet i cant get myself to go outside alone to walk in the forest - sober. And sober I am since a year and until 01.01.26. 

Sometimes i meet with a parent member to have a coffee in a nature bound place.. so Im not staying at home 24/7 but about 24/6 right now. 

I dont know if trying to kayak would give me a reason to go outside - even alone - and give me some joy or peace in life, or if I could barely get myself kayak and i wasted 400€. 

I dont even know if i could enjoy it, because i find it hard to really enjoy anything sober. Difficult to state. I mean i definitely enjoy nature and a good view, but in a way of looking at a nice picture while standing in a broken down house with holes in the roof. 

However since next year i will allow myself again, i might also enjoy kayaking in a different way. 

While there are clubs 20km from here, they come with a yearly subscription and cost me the kayak in about 2-3 years while 1 year is the minimum. Plus i would be bound to their schedule, locations and so on. Additionally i have absolutely no patience anymore to force myself to be in the same place or project with a person i cant stand - At. All. 
And since i have become a rather cynical and depressed individual, chances are high theres gonna be people i cant hear or see - and vice versa. So i guess that would not be for me.

I came to that hobby by the offer, but that thought was with me since years really - just imagined that i would do that with friends im no longer close with. 

I currently have no hobby at all. I have dropped my last one: gaming… since i felt it to be shallow and frustrating. I didnt enjoy it anymore - sober, of course. 

Honestly theres some subtle depression and some not so subtle boredom. I dont know which is worse. 

What would be your experience/ advice or outside view?

I wondering if the council can drive a similar initiative to attract more independent and retail chains to revive something similar for the next generation. 

Something like the new three Bs of: beers, burgers…
* Beers (Phantom brewing, double barrel, Siren craft beer, BrewDog, Zero Degrees)
* Burgers (Honest Burger, 7 Bone Burger, Burger Society and burger chains)

Not sure what the third B could be. Perhaps **bowling?** (Getting a few of these now with three places for it), **boats?** (More Henley but there is the Thames passing through), **biscuits** again (but need to bring back large names and independent bakeries). Actually thinking about it **Bakery** would be quite good (Rise Bakehouse, Wolseley Street Bakery, Warings Bakery, Mon Cheri, Filter Coffee house & Bakery).

1mrz4ph,https://i.redd.it/bylqu38jjejf1.jpeg,Help with apartment furniture layout!,"Hi! I recently moved into a new apartment and would really appreciate some help with furniture arrangement ideas — particularly for the living room. I'm not very spatially gifted and have quite a few pieces which makes this somewhat challenging.

For context, I want to fit in the living room area:

* 2-seat couch + coffee table
* 50"" TV + TV stand
* Tall bookshelf
* Small IKEA Kallax 2x2 bookcase
* Office desk + chair

I get a lot of sunlight which means I can't put the TV on the wall across from the north windows. That leaves only the arrangement in the photo, or putting the TV by the windows and the couch facing north (it won't block much of the window so it works). I'm leaning towards this 2nd option as the arrangement in the photo would block the hallway too much, but one of my main dilemmas is about floating the couch.

If I put the TV by the north windows and the couch against the south wall of the living room, there is 1) a pretty big distance between the couch + TV, and 2) what feels like dead space on the west wall. However, if I float the couch forward (facing north), then you see the back of the couch as you walk in which also feels weird. 

This might be rambling but I would appreciate any insight/advice from more gifted designers. Thanks in advance! ",1,1755359572.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

- double shot espresso (I don’t count espresso/black coffee calories because i choose happiness)

- LIGHT splash of non fat milk 

- EXTRA ICE (you’re gonna chug it anyways it’s so good. this makes it extra cold, gives more volume to fill your glass and gives the cold foam something to sit on so it doesn’t sink super quickly!)

- 2 servings of pumpkin cream cold foam

- dash of cinnamon or pumpkin spice on top!!! 🎃

Guys this cold foam is so much better than any pumpkin spice creamer. Not only does it taste better but you get more for the calories! Plus there’s no synthetic sugar free taste because honestly, in my opinion, the only sugar free syrup I’ve found that tastes okay is vanilla, no other flavour :/

(Please do not comment saying you only drink black coffee or sugar free syrups. I like black coffee but also like a pumpkin spice latte 🤗 let people enjoy things!)

Narrator: Peacekeeper (because of course he’s watching everything like it’s a TV drama)

⸻

Scene 1 – Morning Shift
Ethos is on register duty. Leah is at the next counter, quietly sketching between customers. Ethos decides today’s the day.
Instead of focusing on scanning items, he keeps sliding over to talk to her.

Ethos: “So… uh… what else are you into besides K-Pop?”
Leah: “Anime sometimes, drawing obviously, and… why are you asking instead of bagging those vitamins?”
Customer: glaring

⸻

Scene 2 – The Coffee Gambit
Ethos spends his break time brewing the perfect black coffee — his signature Monk’s Sip style — and offers it to Leah like he’s presenting a holy relic.
Leah smiles politely. “Thanks… but I usually drink tea.”
Peacekeeper in the background: muffled laugh

⸻

Scene 3 – The Attempted Smooth Conversation
Ethos tries small talk again while restocking allergy medicine:
“So, you like… tea, drawing, anime… anything else?”
Leah: “Why? Doing research?”
Ethos: “…Maybe.”

Ryan pops out from the next aisle: “BRO. HE’S INTERVIEWING YOU FOR HIS HEART!”
Ethos: “Ryan, go back to work.”

⸻

Scene 4 – The Talk
Later in the breakroom, Leah’s doodling while Ethos stands awkwardly nearby.
She looks up, her voice gentle but direct:
“I have a feeling you like me, Ethos… but I think it’s better if we stayed friends.”

Silence.
Peacekeeper quietly sips his soda in the corner like he’s watching the season finale of a drama.

⸻

Scene 5 – Closing Shift
Ethos finishes the night stocking shelves, keeping busy. Leah waves goodbye on her way out, sketchbook under her arm.
Ryan whispers: “You okay, man?”
Ethos nods, faint smile: “Yeah. Friends is… fine.”

I had seen him around occasionally and caught him looking my way many many times. A. LOT. I don't know if he was trying to be obvious or just failed at being subtle. 

Anyways... He's cute so I decided I would strike up a conversation the next time we crossed paths. I strategically positioned myself next to GG one time, and lo and behold - he turned around to say hi. We chatted for a few minutes although it was mostly me asking him questions and keeping the conversation going - I chalked that up to nerves on his part. 

Since then, we've run into each other 3 times, and every single time I've been the one to initiate conversation, even a simple 'hey how are you doing?'... He responds briefly and asks me the same, but there's been no demonstrable effort to continue the conversation on his part. He replies and smiles and all but that's about it.  


Now I don't know if he's just a poor conversationalist, or is this one of those times when a crush disippates the moment one establishes contact :( 

I do not know if I should continue to make this effort. I'm not a particularly shy person, but I am not going to suggest coffee apropos of nothing.  My plan was to chat back and forth a few times, see if we vibe, and then maybe bring up a coffee catch up when we leave gym at the same time one day etc. 

I don't run into him too often - maybe once every couple of weeks - the most recent interaction was today which left me quite confused as to where he stands.

(Disclaimer: this isn't about dial in advice/questions!)

Now as an espresso home barista beginner (with quite a few testing and trying different things out I must say) I'm wondering about the following: How in the world do coffee shops do it?

Specifically, I mean, how do they serve good **pure** double shot espresso? I'm talking anything without milk or other ""cheating"". Or even, ***do*** they serve good pure double shot espresso? I don't usually drink many (if any) of that kind when drinking coffee outside. Maybe that's the reason I haven't noticed it (?).

The reason I'm writing this is, like probably a lot of the beginner home baristas out there, going through all those experiments plus the coffee cost and the frustation at the beginning is really not easy.

The thing is, I have had some quite decent shots and then quite a lot of bad shots.

I'm using a Eureka Mignon Manuale (with a Cafemasy bellow mod), a bottomless 58 portafilter with an 18g classic basket (not straight walls, but slight incline to the inside) and a Krups Precision XP801T10 machine.

I've tried a standard tamper and a Bincoo 58,35 mm rippled calibrated spring tamper that does a loud click when hitting the maximum force (and I would say I feel a slight jolt at that moment, which I think can ""micro-break"" or losen the puck from the walls (?)).

I now have ordered a MHW-3Bomber 58,5 mm calibrated flat surface tamper. (Since some tests apparently show that flat is better than rippled -- who knew?!)

Once that tamper arrives, I will probably keep fiddling around with the grind settings. Since this isn't easy to grasp either, as flow rate can be too quick because the grinding is too coarse, or too quick because there's channelling!! I'm definitely starting to pay more attention to really look how the coffee flows from the bottomless portafilter as well as to what the tastebuds ""say"" (sour/okay/bitter).

Now the reason I am writing all of this: Well, do coffee shops actually always and everywhere use perfectly sized tampers (for their baskets)? Have they all these details absolutely figured out? Or is it just that they produce ""decent enough"" espresso that generally gets ""masked"" by a ton of milk in most situations?   
  
I would love to hear from you and your experience as a coffee shop customer, and even more so if you happen to be a coffee shop barista! Do coffee shops nail it nearly always, or are they just decent enough most of the time?",1,1755358963.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I had just come out of the bathroom then upon seeing he had things under control began sorting boxes from our move that have been sitting in his office for 6 weeks. (The rest of the house has been organized, just his office remains to be done). 

Baby came to my side and started chewing (she's teething) on the flap of a box so I moved onto a step up directly next to her so she couldn't reach anything while I finished my task. We were all in full view of each other. 

Baby started crying because she couldn't reach on the step. I was talking to her the whole time but she still wasn't having it and unhappy, crying. 

I finished sorting two boxes then immediately picked her up. 

I realized my husband wasn't on the couch anymore and thought that's weird, he didn't walk by me and had no clue where he went. 

On the way to the kitchen with baby for a bottle I looked out the window and glimpse him in the passenger seat of the car with his book. I opened the back door and gave him the international gesture of what gives dude so he opened the car door and told me he wanted to get away from baby that was crying because she was less than 5ft from me. 

I was flabbergasted. I didn't even say anything, I just shut the door. 

He came in less than 5 mins later. Got more coffee and took it with him along with his book to his office and in passing mentioned baby getting what she wanted so she's happy now. 

I'm not going to make a scene but I'm pissed. This is super shitty parenting in my book. He basically prioritized his Bible book over parenting his child while I was busy completing a short task that's been sitting for 6 weeks that he said multiple times he'd take care of. I'm tired of that corner of the house being off limits to baby because it hasn't been organized, cleaned and made safe yet. 

He snuck away and hid from baby. Not because he was super overwhelmed in the moment caring for her or anything but because he was annoyed with her noise level and I'm guessing with me for not managing her to his satisfaction. 

It feels like he had a not 'my monkeys, not my circus' moment. But the monkey is his and he's ring master.

## Key Features analysis

The 2025 lineup of diet Coke sweatshirts boasts several improvements and innovations compared to previous generations. Here's a deeper dive into the key features that set them apart:

**Material Composition:** many of the best sweatshirts in 2025 utilize a blend of organic cotton (60%) and recycled polyester (40%).This combination provides a soft, comfortable feel against the skin while also offering excellent durability. The organic cotton ensures breathability, minimizing overheating, while the recycled polyester contributes to the sweatshirt's structural integrity and resistance to shrinking or fading.

The specific weaving process used for the fabric further enhances its quality. A tight knit construction minimizes pilling, a common issue with cotton blends, ensuring the sweatshirt maintains its appearance even after multiple washes.The fabric weight is typically around 280-300 GSM (grams per square metre), striking an ideal balance between warmth and weight, making it suitable for year-round wear.

**Print Quality and Durability:** The method used to apply the Diet Coke logo and related designs is crucial for the sweatshirt's longevity. The top-rated sweatshirts employ Direct-to-Garment (DTG) printing with eco-pleasant, water-based inks.

DTG printing allows for intricate and vibrant designs with extraordinary detail. Unlike screen printing, DTG inks penetrate the fabric fibers directly, resulting in a softer feel and eliminating the stiff, plasticky texture often associated with printed apparel. The water-based inks are both environmentally conscious and highly durable, resisting cracking and fading even after repeated washing and drying.

**Fit and Sizing:** A crucial aspect of any comfortable sweatshirt is its fit. The 2025 Diet Coke sweatshirt designs prioritize a relaxed, unisex fit that flatters a variety of body types.

The sizing is generally true to size, but it's recommended to consult the specific size chart provided by the manufacturer.Key measurements to consider include chest width, body length, and sleeve length. the relaxed fit allows for comfortable layering without feeling restrictive. Ribbed cuffs and a ribbed hem provide a snug and secure fit, preventing the sweatshirt from riding up or feeling too loose.

**Design Variety and Customization:** Beyond the classic Diet Coke logo, the 2025 sweatshirts offer a wide range of design options. This spans from minimalist designs featuring subtle branding to bolder, more expressive graphics incorporating iconic Diet Coke imagery and slogans.

Some manufacturers even offer limited customization options, allowing customers to personalize their sweatshirts with their name, initials, or a short message.The availability of different color options also contributes to the design variety, ranging from classic gray and black to brighter, more eye-catching hues. The goal is to cater to a diverse range of tastes and preferences, ensuring there's a Diet Coke sweatshirt for everyone.

1mryr86,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1mryr86/why_choose_the_oster_juice_extractor_for_easy_and/,Why Choose the Oster Juice Extractor for Easy and Powerful Juicing?,"The Oster FPSTJE9010-000 centrifugal juicer became my new morning companion after I decided to experiment with healthier habits. As someone not known for waking up early or having the patience to wash a million parts, I had my reservations about diving into juicing. However, this juicer managed to surprise me, offering a mix of convenience and performance with a touch of “I’m trying to adult” charm.

**A Design That Matches Functionality with Simplicity**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek black and silver design. Its modern aesthetic didn’t look out of place on my kitchen counter, which, let’s be honest, is mostly cluttered with coffee mugs. Besides its appearance, the dimensions (8""D x 18.25""W x 16""H) fit comfortably next to my blender and toaster. The extra-wide feed chute was a standout feature for me, especially since I loathe the tedious process of cutting fruits into smaller pieces. Tossing in whole apples and chunks of carrots felt oddly satisfying.

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
This product boasts 900 watts of juicing power, and let me tell you, it’s not kidding. I tested it with soft fruits like oranges and tougher vegetables like beets, and the results were consistent every time. With two-speed settings, I could easily adjust according to the produce. Both settings worked efficiently, extracting a significant amount of juice while leaving behind dry pulp. Admittedly, the sound startled my dog the first time I turned it on, but for a machine with this much power, it’s not annoyingly loud.  

[Time to see Oster FPSTJE9010-000 cost on Amazon.](https://grillsbbq.com/p/b00xhdc0ci/)  

**Ease of Use for Beginners and Beyond**  
What stood out the most for me was how beginner-friendly this juicer felt. The “Rinse 'n Ready” filter lived up to its name. Trust me, cleaning juicers is the part everyone dreads, but with this machine, I wasn’t scrubbing endlessly. The pulp collector also had an impressive capacity, which meant I wasn’t pausing mid-session to empty it out. There's something delightful about machines that don’t demand constant babysitting.

**Advantages**  
- Powerful motor handles both soft and hard produce efficiently.  
- Large feed chute saves time on prep work.  
- Easy-to-clean design reduces post-juicing effort.  
- Dual-speed options make it versatile for different types of fruits and veggies.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The juicer is a bit bulky, so not ideal if you have limited counter space.  
- While quieter than some competitors, the noise level might still bother light sleepers or pets.  
- The included manual could benefit from clearer troubleshooting tips.  

**Strengths Compared to Competing Options**  
The juicer market is packed with options, and I’ve dabbled with my fair share of them. Compared to other centrifugal juicers in its price range, this model outshines in terms of ease of use, especially the cleaning process. Models like the Breville Juice Fountain series are great but often come with a higher price tag and similar noise levels. On affordability and simplicity, this Oster model makes a solid case. However, masticating juicers like the Omega J8006 offer quieter operation but at the cost of speed and a significantly higher price point.

**Value Proposition**  
One of the first questions I asked myself before purchasing this juicer was, “Is this worth the expense?” After using it for a few weeks, I’d say yes, especially for someone seeking a hassle-free introduction to juicing. It’s not the cheapest model out there, but it strikes a balance between quality and cost that makes it worth considering. You’re getting dependable performance, intuitive design, and features that match its price.

1mryqus,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1mryqus/just_found_my_unicorn/,Just found my unicorn,"So, I’ve been chatting with someone for the past three days. The conversations were fine, just basic stuff like “Have you eaten?”, “Good morning,” and asking how the day was going. Eventually, we planned to meet up today.

At first, I asked where we should meet, but he said, “It’s okay, I’ll just pick you up.” That felt a bit weird because I usually don’t like sharing my address with someone I barely know. But since he insisted, I just shared my location at the security gate instead.

When he arrived, he offered to come in. The first time I saw him I was like, “Oh wow, he’s actually really handsome.” Sometimes people really do look better in person than in pictures. Then he asked me what I wanted to eat. Since I’d already eaten after my gym session, I just said, “Whatever, maybe just coffee.” He suggested this great chicken porridge place nearby, but it was closed, so his next idea was the McD drive-thru. On the way, we started sharing stories with each other.

Out of nowhere, he held my hand and pressed it against his chest, saying he was nervous to meet me. That was so sweet—I almost melted but just laughed it off 🫠. Then I playfully asked him when his birthday was, because on the app it said he was a Cancer. He replied, “February,” and I thought, “Wait, that’s odd.” So I asked for the exact date and turns out—YES—we share the same freaking birthday. I was like, “No wayyy.” The chance of meeting someone with the exact same birthday is like 0.2% .

When we got there, we ordered food, but he wouldn’t let me pay for mine. I felt kinda bad since I’m not used to that, but he insisted, so I just said thank you. After that, we drove around a bit before heading to his apartment with the plan to watch something and cuddle.

And here’s the crazy part: the way he treated me was basically a mirror of how I usually treat others. Most people don’t treat me that way back, but he just naturally did it without me even doing it first. My brain couldn’t process it.

Then my favorite part: the puppy kisses. He did it so much while telling me how good-looking I am. Honestly, I’m a bit skeptical—like, is this love bombing? Haha. But then we made out.

Too bad I couldn’t stay long since I wasn’t feeling well (a bit of a fever) and his friend was coming over. So we just ordered another meal and I left. But even after I got home, he texted me to make sure I arrived safely.

I’m usually scared of being ghosted, but he always finds a way to reassure me through his texts.
And that’s it for today :)

Ps. Anyway, I don’t think our relationship would work. After I came to his apartment, I realized we’re really different financially—he makes about four times more than I do, and I felt a bit insecure about it. So I decided not to text him anymore, just to protect my heart :)

Swivel front wheels provide better turning ability, while larger wheels offer smoother rides on uneven surfaces. Integrated suspension systems absorb shocks, ensuring a comfortable experience for the babies. Check for lockable wheels for added stability when needed.

Very rarely fight, we have been through a lot together, he tells me he loves me often, calls me every day after work or on the way to work. I have been his number one confidant. On the very brink of buying a house. He has never given me any reason to mistrust him around other women, he works in healthcare and his industry is female dominated. I have always had the impression that he was a very honourable person.

He Met a woman (22/F, let’s call her Sarah) at work 5 weeks ago, they seemed to get along at work and also happened to be also contacting each other over Facebook messenger, she initiated with positive feedback. I noticed her name on his phone frequently but because I’ve never felt insecure about women in his life I didn’t read into it. I also don’t usually feel the need to go through his phone.

3 weeks ago, we had a stressful day house hunting. We had some conflict, I was overwhelmed and asked for him to come to the table so to speak (I take on all of the household and emotional labour, I’m also the breadwinner) the next day, he kind of almost instigated a breakup, said he’s been feeling confused about how he feels about me and he thinks if he loved me he would do the washing. The next day he tried to reconcile and said he was just stressed. And maybe not really ready to buy a house. However I am still feeling hurt and now insecure about the state of my relationship.

The next night he had a night shift. The next day after that things were still sore for us, a bit strained and I am still feeling hurt. He mentioned that someone messaged him but was elusive with their name. “Oh just a nurse from work” which was an odd thing that flagged for me. He had never had an issue using coworkers names before. I became very insecure and anxious all of a sudden. I grabbed my keys just to take myself out of the situation. He followed me to my car to talk and I flagged that he was avoiding using her name, Sarah. He didn’t really react. I then had a shower and zoned out in my room. He came in later to talk and he continued on with feeling conflicted about his feelings in our relationship. I asked him outright that if Sarah had anything to do with it, he confirmed it. That was incredibly painful.

I left for work the next day. I then stayed away for the next 4 days. During this time We did talk on the phone occasionally, and I messaged his friends to check in on him and see if he was ok, and to also report back to me on his headspace. One friend mentioned that it does seem to be this girl, Sarah, and a possible workplace crush. (She has also blocked me on instagram for no apparent or verifiable reason) After 4 days I went back to the house to pick up some more clothes and he wanted to talk. He bought up couples therapy (I had requested it on the first night we had conflict) he also bought up that he read up on emotional affairs and he believes he maybe crossed a line with Sarah, I asked what he said that would cross a line. He said that when he complemented her on her academic accomplishments she returned it with a compliment on his own upcoming achievements of buying a house and being engaged. He replied to her by maybe expressing some dissatisfaction with the situation. I haven’t seen the messages. But that day he told me he had stopped talking to her. And personally If that is all that was said, I believe I can move past it. But when I pushed on resolution, as in going ahead with couples therapy, he pulled away again, expressed it was too hard or too much effort. I then looked him in the eyes, and said “I don’t think this is going to work out between us” he then tried to be affectionate again, signalling that he still would like to work on things. I gathered my things and left. He kissed me sweetly as I was in my car about to leave and told me he loves me. I have been staying with my mum since

The next day, he called and said he wants to work on things. However he also had a stressful test/interview coming up and he wanted my opinion. As mentioned earlier, I have been his confidant, I have been the only person he has shared his anxieties with, I am reliable. For that week - Monday through to Thursday (the day of the test) we had short and sweet phone calls. Not much relationship talk, because I found it painful, but it was nice to hear his voice again and not get off the phone crying. Instead we spoke about how he would prepare for his test and I gave some gentle encouragement.

On Thursday, the day of the test, he passed with flying colours. He also locked his phone and keys in his car in another city, he called me from a strangers phone and I organised a lock smith for him. He gets into his car and he also gets a call with a job offer in a really competitive industry, with the offer for 2 locations, one was 90 minutes drive from home, the other was 50 minutes drive from home. They gave him a 30 minute window to accept the offer with his choice of location. He chose the location closest to home. When he got back to our hometown I suggested we meet for lunch to celebrate. Lunch was initially very nice and positive. After a little while though he started to internally regret his decision on location, as the population is the smaller of the two locations (3000 population vs 10,000 population) and he was concerned about his experience building. He started spiraling into anxiety and I tried to calm him. However he then started turning his mood onto me. I left crying. He called a few hours later and apologised.

The next day on the Friday we had a little more contact, he knew that during our time apart I had sought out mental health support and I had my first appointment that morning. He called before it, and then requested that I call him back after. After my psych appointment I decided not to call, instead I went shopping and bought myself some expensive moisturiser. When I was driving home he called me. His tone seemed a little anxious. He Mentioned there was some mail for me so I drove by to pick it up. We had a pleasant interaction and then I left. He had another night shift that night.

Later that evening a girl friend of mine called to check in on me, I gave her a brief rundown and she then asked if I would like her to check if he and Sarah are following each other on Instagram (last time we checked - Monday that week - they weren’t following each other) I said yes, so she checked. And they’re following each other. I felt myself becoming increasingly anxious and insecure again. And I messaged him “have you been using me this week for emotional support, with no actual intention of reconciling?” But I then quickly unsent it. He saw the “unsent message” and called me while on shift. Because I was spiralling I asked him outright “Are you now following Sarah?” “Yes” “Are you talking to her again” “yes” “Have you just used me all week for emotional support?” “No, not at all. I’m at work I can’t talk right now” and we ended the conversation. That night I could barely sleep.

The next morning (Saturday) around 10:30 am (he would have gone to bed at 6:30am) I drove to his house (his mums house, where we used to live together while we were saving to buy a property) and woke him up. I kind of freaked out on him. I asked to go through the messages. He said no it’s a breach of privacy. I said he lied to me, he denied lying because he did stop talking to her for a few days, but then replied to her message and continued talking consistently, but tried to assure me it was nothing inappropriate and work related. I cried. I was a mess. He still gave me affection and didn’t want me to leave and was trying to be sweet. He says he still wants to work on things and that he will “think about it” regarding the messages. He called later in the day and suggested we go to a housewarming party we were both already invited to, as a chance to reconnect and maybe have a nice time. I decided to go because I already bought the friend some gifts I wanted to give her. Problem was they’re all his friends. And usually I’m fine with that when I have a lot of self confidence, but that night I definitely had zero confidence. And as soon as we get there, there’s a few familiar faces but a bunch of new people too, and he doesn’t introduce me at all. I ended up having a panic attack. There was another plus one that saw me and I told her what’s going on. She said she wouldn’t tell anyone but apparently she did. Anyway the party sucked for me but everyone else seemed to have fun. When he did come and eventually talk to me we were with 2 other people chatting and his phone was next to him. And guess who he gets a message from? Sarah… he locks his phone quickly and I just go non verbal. We left the party shortly after and had more arguments on the way home. He is refusing to completely cut contact or even limit contact because he doesn’t want to make it weird at work (he does work at a really gossipy branch) he tells me the messages are completely innocent and almost entirely work related, but will not let me verify by reading the messages. I can’t really remember much because of heightened emotions but we Tried to calm it and reconcile slightly when we get back to his place. We talk, we start kissing, maybe initiate sex, he says before we actually do anything “if we have sex it doesn’t mean we’re working on getting back together” so I stop. He stands up, and just opens the door for me to leave. I was just so shocked he must have read my face. He shuts the door and says “that’s harsh I’m sorry” I can’t really remember how we stopped fighting but when I went to leave he tried to be affectionate again. Asked me to message him in the morning.

On Sunday I went to work and we texted general small talk. After work I went there just to see how I feel when I look at him. And there’s still love in my heart for him. He said that (the person whose house warming it was) just called and complained about me. Apparently I ruined her party and multiple people complained. I didn’t really say anything to that. Then I told him that I don’t want to continue this and that I’ll let him know when I have a place to live so I can pick up my stuff. Then he protests about the breakup. Wants couples counselling. We’ve been low contact since. Short phone calls each day. I slowed down on initiating contact, he would call me most of the time. That was Sunday  to Wednesday.

By Wednesday afternoon something just snapped in me. On my drive home from work I just screamed in the car. I applied for a new passport and I’m booking flights to Italy for October. He called around 4:30pm and I just couldn’t help but be short with him. I wanted to hear from him all day, wanted to know that he was thinking about me and cared for me. But when he called me I couldn’t get the anger out of my heart. I told him I deserve better. I reminded him of all the times I’ve let him go through my messages with guys who message me about MMA. (Side note I’m an MMA fighter, I’m also quite conventionally attractive without being vain) How he has expressed jealousy over attention I was getting from one particular guy and I immediately cut him off. And that he’s not willing to do that for me. He asked well do you still want couples counselling and do you still want to work on things? I told him yes I do, but I don’t like that it’ll be entirely my responsibility to seek out a therapist, and book the appointment, make sure the appointment works for his schedule, and then probably pay for it too. He says he wishes to talk more that night. I said if he wants to he can call, he knows I will finish work at 10pm. I gave myself a mental check out time of 10:15pm. If he doesn’t call before then I turn off my phone. He called at 10:10 and said he understood what I was saying and he will take the lead with booking couples counseling. I told him honestly that I was relieved to hear that.

I have now resigned myself to just data collecting at this point, I will no longer chase, or initiate any contact.

Thursday he had a very big day at work, did a lot of overtime and called late in the evening. He bought up couples counseling unprompted, but said he hadn’t had time to look into it.

On Friday he also had a big day at work and called late in the evening, when he bought up couples counseling unprompted I asked for us to have something booked in by end of day Monday as I don’t like being in this limbo. He agreed. He then asked if we could catch up for a coffee the next day after I finish work at 2pm. Coffee shops close at 3:30 where we live. I agreed, and told him to contact me after 2pm if he would like to catch up face to face.

Saturday (today) At 2:15pm he called and we made conversation. We then met for a coffee at 2:45pm it was pleasant, I don’t want to get into anything too heavy so we don’t. He kind of mentioned buying property again but I just didn’t engage in that part of the conversation and he dropped it. We met and talked for an hour before I told him it’s time to wrap it up. He walked me to my car. As we were there he leaned in for a kiss, a small kiss. It felt awkward but nice. And that brings us to now. I’m feeling anxious still, and very conflicted. I love him deeply, and don’t want to let go. But I’m so scared that by Monday he wouldn’t have booked anything, and he’s still communicating with Sarah, and I’m worried I’m being taken for a ride.

I am thinking about presenting an ultimatum,

Option A. allow me to verify his words by letting me read through their messages. If what he is saying is the truth we can work through it with a therapist.

Option B. He refuses to let me see the messages and our relationship is now over, however I will still be seeking closure by reaching out to Sarah and asking for the context of the messages",5,1755358157.0,AmIOverreacting,14,1.0,False

1mryh19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInReviews/comments/1mryh19/reveal_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_bissell_spinwave/,Reveal the Pros and Cons of the Bissell SpinWave Cordless Pet Mop,"**Dust-Free Living with the Bissell 23157 Cordless Spin Mop**  

I’ve had my fair share of cleaning gadgets over the years, and testing cleaning equipment has become a bit of a personal hobby. Naturally, when I got the chance to try out the Bissell 23157 Cordless Spin Mop, I jumped at it. What first caught my eye about this floor cleaner was the promise of cordless convenience combined with pet-centric features. Living with a Labrador retriever who sees every puddle and patch of dirt as an invitation only adds to my need for hardy cleaning tools. My journey with this device has been filled with highlights and, admittedly, some small frustrations, but the overall performance has a lot going for it.  

**Design and Build: Engineered for Convenience**  

From an aesthetics standpoint, the design strikes a balance between function and style. Its violet, green, and silver color scheme is subtle yet modern. What stood out first was how portable and light it felt upon unboxing. Weighing in at just 8 ounces, the mop didn’t leave my lower back crying for relief after a 15-minute run. The low-profile swivel head also makes maneuvering into tricky spots around baseboards and under furniture feel effortless. For those who despise battling with a bulky cleaning contraption, this design element is a real boon.  

**Performance: Where It Shines Bright**  

After scattering some fine dust, mud dribbles, and the occasional dried ketchup stain (thanks, kids) across my kitchen and hallway floors, I was ready to see what the mop could do. Spinning mop pads powered by the 18V lithium-ion battery didn’t disappoint. Surprisingly sturdy and with 20 minutes of runtime, it powered through sticky messes on my tile flooring, leaving a polished shine in its wake. One of my favorite features is the on-demand spray mechanism. Just a press of the button, and voilà—the cleaning solution dispenses precisely where it’s needed. It’s safe to say this feature transformed stubborn grime removal into an oddly satisfying task.  

[Check Bissell 23157 price on Amazon.](https://appliancedirectory.com/p/b08j1dxclb/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- Cordless convenience lets you clean freely without tripping over cords.  
- Lightweight design reduces strain while cleaning larger areas.  
- On-demand spray feature provides accurate and effective solution application.  
- Included reusable mop pads are eco-friendly and easy to wash.  

**Battery and Charging: Cordless, but Time Matters**  

The lithium-ion battery performed as advertised with a respectable 20-minute runtime. The four-hour charge time, however, did make me raise an eyebrow. For someone tackling a moderately sized three-bedroom apartment or house, that 20-minute cap can feel a tad restrictive. I found myself breaking up cleaning sessions to accommodate the battery life. While the cordless freedom is welcome, folks with larger spaces might need to plan strategically or grab some coffee while waiting for a recharge.  

**Convenience: Thoughtful Extras or Just Fluff?**  

The Bissell Spin Mop includes thoughtful accessories like four reusable mop pads and two trial-size cleaning solutions. The mop pads deserve a shout-out—they’re not only durable but also do a great job soaking up heaps of pet hair left behind by my enthusiastic shedding machine, aka the dog. What I loved most, though, was the swivel steering. Navigating the narrow crevices under chairs or coffee tables was surprisingly easy—no awkward repositioning needed.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited runtime makes it tricky for large homes or prolonged cleaning tasks.  
- Extended charge time (four hours) impacts flexibility for quick clean-ups.  
- Works best on hard floors; isn’t compatible with carpets or rugs.  

**Competitive Options in the Market**  

In this category, there are countless competitors, but the Shark Steam Mop immediately comes to mind. While the Shark gets bonus points for its steam functionality (ideal for those who want to sanitize heavily used spaces thoroughly), it comes with a cord—something that makes the Bissell spin mop advantageous in terms of mobility and modern convenience. On the other hand, robotic vacuums like the iRobot Braava Jet suggest an even more hands-off way of managing floor stains, yet they lack the aggressive ground-in stain removal power that the Bissell provides. All in all, this product carves out its niche with a blend of manual precision and cordless practicality.   

**Value for Money: Truly Worth It?**  

Evaluating the cost versus functionality, the device provides value especially for folks managing pet messes on sealed hard surfaces. Its reusable components and reliance on cordless power bump up its score on the cost-effectiveness scale—you’re slicing potential long-term expenses. However, the requirement of long charging downtime might not appeal to those needing swift cleaning solutions.

1mryc2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1mryc2p/relieved_i_figured_out_how_somebody_unknowingly/,Relieved I Figured Out How Somebody Unknowingly Triggered Me,"So there's a guy I had/have a crush on. A couple months ago he said something kind of innocent to me and it made me explode on him, I couldn't quite understand why. One of my friends thinks it's because he made a joke that fell flat. 

I recently began meeting a new therapist and after she did her on own intake with me she said, ""I think you have some deeply rooted trauma from your childhood. I don't believe you even know what triggers you the majority of the time."" That blew my mind because I believe it's true. In the past, it's taken several hours with other therapists to figure out how something innocent sounding made me explode for days.

My crush is a male store manager. He's not my manager, I was simply a frequent customer who often chatted with him which became somewhat personal on both ends. I interpreted his joke as making me feel abandoned but I knew it was deeper than that.

For the majority of my life, I've struggled with male authority figures or in which there is a power imbalance between us. Our conversing may have turned casual, but until I exploded on him our relationship was still professional. When I exploded on him, he didn't respond with compassion like I hoped; he responded with toughness which then further triggered me.

I feel like there is nothing I could possibly say or do to repair our relationship and I've stayed away from his store. However, he has tried contacting me several times by phone and email over the past couple of months and I haven't responded because I'm ashamed and also don't know what to tell him. I'm a very complicated person and I don't know how to unpack all of this with him without sounding unhinged. 

Maybe having this realization is all I need to help me in the future, but I can't help but wonder if there's anything else I could do with this information. I'd still like to have coffee with him if he's still up for it,(like he offered to do a couple months ago) but I'll need to figure out what I'd want to get out of coffee first.

**JANA SHUCKS CORN AND GOES QUIET**

Jana’s influencing has waned down to just a trickle of occasional posts about makeup, dishcloths, Thieves cleaner, spray bottles, and compostable coffee cups. She learned from her younger-but-much-wiser sister Jessa that tidying the kitchen and loading the dishwasher at night makes for an easier morning. THIS IS BRAND NEW INFORMATION! The only other post she made was a video montage of her and all of her Wissman siblings-in-love shucking corn on the Wissman farm. (ETA - She resurfaced again this morning with a predictable post for her and Stephen’s 1st anniversary, tagging her “forever love.”) 

**JILL & D’WRECK CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY WITH CHAMPAGNE**

Jill and Derick dropped their boys off with Famy and Deanna (which I guess is still preferable to dropping them at the Big House - a statement in and of itself) so they could go on a belated anniversary weekend getaway. The place they stayed (lovely btw) was tagged and the description had the hashtag #partner, I’m assuming that it was a sponsored trip. Their anniversary package included flowers, cake, charcuterie, and champagne (which they made sure to take a video of them drinking…somewhere Jim Bob is clutching his can of hairspray). They had in-house couples massages and an in-house dinner cooked by a chef. They strung together a bunch of clips of them doing very normal stuff like walking into the place, feeding each other cake, kissing on the porch and sitting in the hot tub…clips that they had to have taken by setting up a camera somewhere…but nevermind that! We were also subjected to a shirtless Derick a few times. 

In other news, Jill’s homeschooling, homemaking skills, and hippie hair extensions are still going strong! 

**CLICKBAIT SEEWALD ARRIVES IN A FLURRY OF YOUTUBE INCOME**

Clickbait Seewald had a job before he had a name, and was put right to work in stretching out his mother’s YouTube video series out from here to kingdom come. 

Video 1 of Clickbait’s “birth story” contained neither birth nor story, and was basically just Jessa’s prenatal ramblings about bodily fluids and functions (TMI), a reveal of her having used the wrong paint on her baseboards while she was nesting, and her feeling like “the watched pot that never boils” and “a big whale.” 

Video 2 showed the actual birth of Clickbait starting with her walking the stairs at The Big House and her water breaking on her parents couch, christening yet another Birtha into the family lore. As JB aptly stated, “I tell you what - these couches have been through a lot!” (Ew, I don’t even want to know what that means!) They had a minor scare with some unusual bleeding that made them very glad to get to the hospital. Clickbait made his arrival at 9:28PM, with Jessa having only about a 7 hour labor. He was 10lb even. Jessa “sobbed like a baby” (her words, not mine) when he was born. Jordyn was the sibling Jessa decided to have in attendance at her birth, and she got to cut the cord, which she thought was “so cool.” The “Absolutely Wonderful” and “Such a Treasure” Michelle was also in attendance, who was with Jessa “every step of the way.” 

Video 3 revealed Clickbait’s jinder (it’s a boy) and showed him being introduced to his gaggle of siblings along with Jim Bob and Josie. It also contained a riveting (not) church history lesson from Bin the preacher, as he and Jessa discussed potential names after ancient church leaders like Ignatius, Athanasius, Edward the VI, John Owen, John Calvin, and Saint Patrick. Fern said they should name him “Rainbow Print.” Ivy voted for “Bunny.” Jim Bob (excited for grandbaby #39) suggested “John MacArthur” (which is hilarious because he’s not a Calvinist). Jessa said that he looks like Pork Chop. 

FINALLY in video 4, they revealed that - on the 5th day of Clickbait’s life - he finally had a name: Edward Owen. All that angst for such a vanilla name. Phew. No wonder that baby sleeps so much. All that work had to be exhausting for the little guy. He already deserves a raise  


**JIN & JER AND THEIR ED-JY PICTURES OF #FALMILYTIME (PLUS A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE)**

I continue to be honestly mystified by the Vuolo’s IG feeds. They love to outdo one another in showing their other half to be awkward. Their photos regularly are half blurry, cropped to only show half of a face, out of focus, completely blurry, or are taken when someone is obviously in the middle of talking or doing something like stepping out of a car. Jeremy also loves sharing random things that are also blurry, out of focus, half visible, or just plain weird. Like a full photo of just the bottom of a pool or a McDonalds drive through screen that’s completely shattered. Did I mention the blurry photos? What is this nonsense?

Also, as much as they are protecting their kids by not showing their faces…they are doing an awful lot of sharing of the rest of their kids bodies (even in swimwear…have we learned NOTHING!??!)...including some (blurry) side profiles, and a lot of pictures of them from above and behind. She captioned them with the hashtag #falmilytime (SOTDRT strikes again!)

The only products JinJer promoted on IG this week were a sectional from Costco and some baby lotion. 

The ads on their podcast are a whole separate beast, but there’s some GREAT NEWS for all of you out there who don’t like their ads. Last week they announced that “after getting sooooooo many requests from their listeners” they are “seriously considering launching a membership platform.” They are still “just dreaming up all these ideas,” but the membership platform might include bonus podcasts, ad-free episodes, behind the scenes content, a listener voicemail where people can leave messages that they listen and react to on the podcast, and “other ways that we can just connect inTINtionally with you all.” But, they want it to be listener shaped, so they want their listeners to fill out a survey. Almost all the comments both on Facebook and Instagram are negative, saying it’s all about the money for the “greedy” Vuolos and they will lose listeners if they go this route. The comments said the potential model is “tacky and unnecessary,” “grossly out of touch with the average family,” “superficial and phony to make a dollar,” “following the way of the world,” and (my personal favorite) “I feel like this is something Jim Bob would do.”

On the podcast, they did a react episode to Jinjer and Jeremy doing a rewatch of “16 Children and Moving In.” It was disturbing to see Jer “get sucked into” the rewatch because he was excited to “see cute little Jinger.” He honestly seemed more excited to see “cute little Jinger” than he normally is to see “my grown up wife, Jinger.” 

The rewatch was mostly predictable, with Jinger calling everything “wild” and “crazy.” She talked in depth about the staging of their home by TLC, telling about what they got to keep (the long table and fragile plant holders that were expensive and got knocked over and broken) and what they didn’t (clothes…hmmm wonder if that included jean skirts and Michelle’s lime green uniform!). 

The long table was reclaimed wood, unfinished/unsealed (because they were on a time crunch), with grooves in it. She said, “So the first few times the kids ate something at it…it literally seeped down into the wood. They had us go eat our breakfast at the table before it was sealed. So then you literally have cereal…mashed potatoes stuffed into the cracks of the table. So we went with a butter knife and were trying to scrape out the food. But when they sealed it, I think because there was some food on there, there were a couple of fruit flies that got sealed. It’s so nasty!” (Nasty indeed!) The table eventually got donated to the Bates family. They didn’t have a way to transport it, but they strapped it onto the top of their 15 passenger van for the 14-16 hour drive to Tennessee.  

Jinger has trauma-bonded with their food-scarcity-days favorites, claiming she still likes to eat a can of tuna (plain, or with BBQ or mustard) or canned green beans with salt and vinegar.

The Duggars had product integration deals with Campbell’s Soup, Swiffer, and V8…influencers before influencers were a thing. The apple doesn’t fall far from that tree!   


**THE LATEST FROM JINUINE JOY**

Joy continues to lead from the front as Head Influencer of the Duggar clan. Promoted products included the usual clothes, shoes, deodorant, sunscreen, vitamin gummies, and a car charger with retracting cords. She’s already transitioning to fall products and posing in sweaters when it ain’t even below 80 in Arkansas I’m pretty sure. 

She also bared her legs to show us how she uses the viral hair eraser. I had to cover my screen to avoid being defrauded by seeing so much skin. She loves being “real” through the use of Q&As with her fans, sharing her “day in mah life” stories, and making sure we know she still has dirty dishes in her sink (as if anyone is surprised by this). 

As for interesting tidbits from her latest Q&A’s…Out of all her brothers, she talks to OGJed the most. She includes her kids in conversations about Annabell. They don’t have a strict screen time schedule, but try to limit the time (there will be “different amounts” for “different seasons”), and they use the Gominno app to find appropriate content. She loves road trips, but doesn’t read books. She claims that their “family life was the same when the cameras were rolling and when they were off,” (Sure, Joy) but admits that there was more “planning ahead” (read: scripting) in later seasons to avoid repetitive content. She hasn’t had tater tot casserole in years, but still loves it. She does plan on homeschooling indefinitely, but is also taking it one year at a time. That’s homeschool mom code for “I have no plan.” She would not do Dancing with the Stars if she was asked, because she believes that she can’t dance and can’t master dances even with hours of practice because she has tried. 

Joy has no qualms about sharing her kids with the internet…at the chiropractor, grocery shopping, working on the farm, building forts, riding bikes, watching TV, singing in the car, making a meal together, hanging out with their cousins, etc. She’s still a country girl, choosing to show herself baling hay for their cows, operating a skidsteer, and training for a triathlon. 

I have to admit, I appreciate her jinuineness. Unlike her influencer idol Carlin, Joy she seems to be sharing products that work for her as a person and a mom, rather than making her kids perform just to sell stuff. Only time will tell if that continues. 

One weird thing she did last week though was link to light fixtures and mirrors (and the clothes she was wearing) in a house that Austin is finishing up…as a contractor…for someone else. Imagine that, knowing some famous ex-reality star influencer took bathroom selfies in your mirror. I guess the rule here is never turn down an opportunity to earn commission on stuff, even if it’s other people’s stuff. 

**KATHY TURNS 27…ANOTHER YEAR OLDER AND ANOTHER YEAR SNARKIER**

OGJed and Katey got to celebrate Katey’s 27th birthday by hanging out at Burn Boot Camp with Katie’s Bestie [Drews.gal](http://Drews.gal), Josiah, and Lauren. They all surprised her with a jump scare when she walked in the door and a “birthday workout.” Then they all posed in front of the balloon arch (which was there for the Burn Boot Camp Era’s Week, not the birthday - “Pretend it’s yours, save the difference!”) and extra balloons that they brought with them. Kathy wore a pale pink “Raising Babes” tshirt. Not “Raising Babies”…but “Raising Babes.” Given that all 3 of her girls are under 4 years old, this just feels gross. 

At 27, Kathy is making snarking on the snark part of her personality, by rage-baiting with posts of her posing with a Starbucks cup bearing her Reddit moniker “Kathy” saying she should just change her name already, and a cringy reel about how people just don’t get that being a SAHM is a real job and keep asking her what she does for work. (As if anyone in her circle is actually asking her that! I have my doubts.) The end shot of the reel is a true caricature of SAHM life. I’ve been a SAHM for 15 years, so I know a thing or two about it. While exhaustion, multitasking, and feeling undervalued by society come with the territory of this very real job, at no point in my illustrious SAHM career have I ever been (not) vacuuming (with an unplugged vacuum) while stirring a pot (on a stove that’s not lit) while baby wearing with 2 preschoolers underfoot while putting my big toe on a bumbo with another baby on it. You are a SAHM, Kathy, not the Cat in the Hat!

**JAMES WENT A’COURTIN!**

We know that James has a blonde significant other based on the most recent family photo at JB’s birthday party, but her identity remained a mystery until James was tagged in a group photo cozied up next to a blonde that the interwebs (starting with Tumblr and trickling down to TikTok) have identified as Lydia Swanson (Lauren Swanson Duggar’s younger sister). I have tried in vain to hunt down the original photo. James has either untagged himself or the original photo was leaked from a private account. There may be another set of siblings married to siblings in the Duggar family’s future! 

**FAMY’S GONNA FAMY**

Famy is still riding the Duggar gravy train. Currently stuck in the Twilight Zone between the launch of Shiny Happy People Season 2 and the upcoming release of her memoir, she’s more than happy to promote both. She didn’t talk for a day (the silence must have been golden, but alas it was shortlived) to prepare for the 3-day recording session for the audiobook version of Holy Disrupter. The whole experience is “so unreal” and “so crazy,” but she loves that she’s “speaking truth” in her “own voice” and she hopes that her story “can relate and encourage you in your life.” Here’s hoping her book has better grammar…or at least better editors!  She also recently did an interview with the Today show that will air in October alongside the release of her book on October 14th. The real question is this: will she have another People Magazine cover to put on her Wall of Fame?

**TATOR TOTS: THIS AND THAT FROM THE DUGGARVERSE**

Kindra and her workout skirt were only seen once at Burn Boot Camp over the last few weeks. I guess the shorts were just a fluke. Josiah and JACKSON showed up at Burn Boot Camp when they were offering a week of free camps. You know the Duggars…they will always show up for free stuff! 

Jer & Hannah’s feed continues to just be infrequent pictures of their kids and family. 

Maddie got her wisdom teeth taken out this week, and Jase has been keeping her company and playing cards with her. Their spot on the JinJer podcast dropped this week, but I haven’t listened to it yet. I’ll cover that in the next digest. 

“Family Conferences” (\*coughcoughIBLPcoughcough\*) has been holding their annual conference at Big Sandy this past week. This year’s theme is “Count it All Joy!” What they are not counting is a big attendance number. A conference that used to be held in stadiums is down to one small auditorium. JimBob, Michelle, Johanna, and Jinnifer have all been spotted in Instagram photos (along with Gil Bates and one of his daughters). It’s safe to assume the rest of the Lost Kids are there too. Courtships aren’t going to start themselves! Gotta find those mates somewhere safe, especially after the Derick Debacle. 

Alert Family Camps has been promoting their upcoming fall family camp using every letter of the alphabet. A is for airplane rides…M is for Mom’s Tea…P is for Ponderosa Press, etc. Journey to the Heart starts next weekend! We will see if any Lost Girls attend! 

Happy Saturday and Happy Snarking!

Of course. 



The online check-in was broken, too, so the Journalist had to queue. He travelled light, but what difference did it make when everyone else travelled heavy and would argue they didn’t with the girl at the desk? 



As usual, security was a shitshow. An old guy was fiddling with hearing aids as an increasingly testy TSA agent told him to remove his belt. 



Still, something was different. There were actual 'suits' with the run-of-the-mill staff. They were looking for someone or something. 



The Journalist wasn't a racist; he wrote for the country's number one left-wing publication, but he was human. As he grabbed his grey plastic tray and stuffed his wallet back into his pocket, he looked back at the people filtering through. 



A Middle Eastern man caught his attention. The Journalist looked away, internally repeating, ""I am not racist,"" and then he looked back. The guy did look shifty. Sweat beaded on his forehead. How? They were in Chicago in winter. 



The old guy’s wife, her suitcase splayed open, was causing such a stir that she even got the attention of the suits. She said she needed her moisturiser because blah, blah, blah. 



The Middle Eastern man seemed to use it as an opportunity to slip through. 



The inside of his backpack flashed on the X-ray scanner—wires of some kind, but the agent on the desk was distracted... 



No, he was being silly. They were professionals. 



He stopped, laughing at the thought. They weren't professionals, but in the year 2025, in the Trump years, terrorists did not casually slip onto flights heading to Washington. 



… 



He drank a drab coffee at Starbucks and finished an even drabber article on FEMA allocation funds before heading to his gate. 



It never failed to amaze him just how bad people were at travelling. How long had commercial air travel been around? The 1960s? 



The herd complained when they were sent away because their zone was not boarding. When they got on the plane, they would shove bags into overhead storage slots that clearly didn’t fit, and then they’d stand up when the seatbelt sign was on, fumbling with the airport toilet lock. 



He clung to a small fantasy—the days of Mad Men. When a gentleman would wear a suit and not a neck pillow, when you'd fly Pan Am, smoke a cigar as a pretty hostess poured you a whiskey, and the guy beside you was not 'mining jewels' the volume on his iPad up full blast. 



He dismissed the fantasy as classist, just as he dismissed his racist fear of the Middle Eastern man. 



He was the very last passenger to board. Seat 19c. He always requested an aisle seat because he didn't want to be boxed in. 



His worst fear was someone striking up a conversation. Over the years, he'd built up some tricks. At all times, he maintained a neutral expression. Chatterboxes were always looking for a way in– a shared human experience–better to stare blankly ahead like a robot. 



But his real secret weapon was his headphones. Rarely did he splash out, especially on electronics, but these were a work of art. The Bose Quiet Ultras were not too dissimilar to the brand the guys wore on the tarmac. He didn't even listen to music. Their very presence was his signal. 



'You know Washington well?' 



It had to be a joke. They'd literally just taken off. But no, the man beside was looking straight at him. 



He had no choice. There'd been an acknowledgement of reception, even if only in the Journalist's eyes. 



'What's that?' 



'Washington. You're from there?' 



The Journalist rapidly did the calculations in his head. Was he 'a crazy?’ The guy looked 55, dressed in a suit, but it was very sloppy, the tie pulled to the side at a jaunty angle. He was out of shape, too, not enough to spill over into the next seat but enough to know he didn't take great care of himself. This general chaos manifested in his hairstyle—a rapidly developing Einstein. 



'Boston,’ the Journalist answered. 



Matters were complicated further because nobody sat in the seat between them. Often, two chatterboxes could be palmed off on one another. 



'So why DC?' 



'Because I'm a political journalist.' 



He stopped because the guy's eyes lit up. Fuck. He'd gone and done it. Since Facebook, every man and his dog wanted to chat politics, and there was no surer route to someone's crazy than talking politics on a plane. 



The Journalist rapidly glanced away, trying to make space with a wandering gaze. 



He knew the rhythms of the 20.10 flight to DC like the morning stirrings of his bowels. 



The crew hadn't yet been with the complimentary coffee and waffles. 



More curiously, all four attendants were gathered outside the cockpit in conference. 



'I've got a story for you,' the Passenger said. 



Every crazy had a story and yet, at the same time, didn't. 



Something was definitely up. They were talking to the captain on the radio. The Journalist's mind flashed back to the suspicious Middle Eastern man. He raised himself slightly in his seat—nothing in front—and then, as he turned, he flinched because the 'suspect' was in the same aisle on the opposite side. 



It couldn't be his imagination. This guy was shifty. His bald head gleamed with perspiration, and rivulets of it ran down into his long beard. 



The Journalist's seatmate now had a laptop out. What the fuck would this be? A chemtrail conspiracy involving his local mayor. 



Up ahead, one of the attendants pressed her face against the window as another peeled off and looked down the cabin. Yep, row 19 seemed to be their focal point. 



'I had no idea who to go to this information with,' the Journalist's seatmate said. ‘My contact in Brazil told me not to share it online because it would be intercepted—that I should go to DC, wait outside Congress if I had to– find a representative of the House Oversight Committee.' 



'Look,' the Journalist turned to him, 'something isn't right here.' 



'You're right there, buddy. Just wait until you see this video,' he said, showing the laptop. 



Of course, the Journalist's death would be absurd. Everything in 2025 was absurd. He'd be blown out of the sky by a coat bomber protesting the war in Gaza when he himself was among the first writers to label it a genocide. All the while, the last thing he'd hear would not be Rebecca's voice but some nut discussing his town's version of Pizzagate. 



And then he paused…hard…thoughts of terrorism leaving his head. Thoughts of everything else. 



The crazy guy's video. 



There was no other word for it; it showed an alien. This alien, with grey skin and insectoid eyes, was sitting at a table, and seated beside this fucking E.T. was the 'crazy.’ 



'What is this?' 



'My name is David Bellweather,' he continued, 'I work out of the University of Chicago, specialising in astrobiology. Two days ago, I got a call from a colleague in Manaus, where a team had successfully summoned a UAP.' 



The Journalist peered dumbfounded at the man, his rational brain creaking and groaning. 



CGI? Why? How? No. 



The man took out a further document. 



'Here is a transcript of the telepathic conversation, and here is a sequenced genome of the NHI. Now, there's a problem: the team in Brazil have gone dark, and this mad dash to the capital has become necessary. Do you think you could help?'  



A wave of panic rippled through the plane. People pointed out of the small windows. 



Out of habit, he glanced at the Middle Eastern man who brought out a Catholic rosary. 



Two fighter jets hugged the wings of the airliner. 



The captain came over the PA. He was professional but couldn't keep the utter confusion out of his voice. 



'Hey folks, captain speaking, uhm, slightly odd situation up here, uhm, military escort, but nothing from ground control, uhm,' and he paused almost like a commentator, 'now we have a military cargo carrier coming into view off our nose and… AAARGH.' He screamed while simultaneously trying to take evasive action



It was too late.

New ”homebarista” here. 
Just bought the ec685 and made my first espresso. 

I have few things I would like to ask:

 1. The used ground coffee doesn’t fall out as nice button as it does in youtube videos. Am I tamping the coffee too hard? Other issue might be that my grinder leaves the coffee quite coarse. It looks more like normal filter coffee. Cheap grinders can be recommended. The espresso tasted great nevertheless and had the creme on top. 

2. In the videos people use this bottomless portafilter. Is that worth the investment? What does it do differently?

3. What accessories you recommend? The original plastic tamper is not nice, that I will change soon. (Recommendations?) I also don’t have this mixer thing (the thing with spikes, dont know the name). Is that worth to buy? ",1,1755357507.0,barista,0,1.0,False

For example, I (33F) was messaging with someone (33F) from a “looking for friends” group on Facebook. The conversation moved to WhatsApp. 

We’re practically neighbors, so meeting up should be super easy. We agreed to meet at a nearby coffee house at 4 p.m. I sent a quick message a couple of hours before to check it was still happening, and she postponed to the next day. Then the next day, the same thing happened and she canceled.

For context: I do have friends, but I’ve recently moved to a new place and come out of a long-term relationship, so I’m trying to expand my circle. I’m really hoping to build friendships where both people put in effort and follow through.

What I don’t understand is: if someone joins a group specifically to make friends, why would they act this way? Are they just looking for people to chat with online? Are they too busy? Too anxious? Do most people not really want to meet in person anymore?

Has anyone else experienced this? Why do people act like they want friends but then never actually follow through?

1mrxyky,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingSpacesHub/comments/1mrxyky/does_super_liner_tesla_model_3_floor_mats_review/,Does SUPER LINER Tesla Model 3 Floor Mats Review Justify Its High Ratings?,"I recently got the chance to test out the SUPER LINER T-Mode-Y Tesla Model 3 Floor Mats, and as someone who spends a lot of time commuting and driving with kids and pets, I had high expectations. These mats are specifically designed for the 2024-2025 Tesla Model 3 Highland, promising a custom fit and comprehensive all-weather protection. After weeks of driving under various conditions, I can confidently share my thoughts on their performance and practicality.

**Tailored Design and Perfect Fit**

The first thing I noticed when unboxing the 6-piece floor mat set was how meticulously they were crafted. Custom-engineered for the Tesla Model 3 Highland, they fit snugly in every crevice—no bunching, gaps, or sliding. Installing them was a breeze; I didn't need to wrestle or adjust them repeatedly. Each piece, from the front and rear mats to the front trunk and cargo liners, seemed to click perfectly into place. It felt as if Tesla themselves had included these mats as an upgrade option straight off the assembly line.

[Check SUPER LINER T-Mode-Y price on Amazon.](https://interiorsblog.com/p/b0bv222v54/)

**Outstanding Durability and All-Weather Protection**

Rain, coffee spills, muddy boots—you name it, I've tested these mats against it. Somehow the TPE material holds up spectacularly. Even after two weeks of wet and salty winter weather, followed by a muddy weekend hike with my dog, the mats barely showed signs of wear. The raised edge design that SUPER LINER highlights wasn't just a gimmick either; it worked like a charm for containing liquids and debris. My carpets remain as pristine as when I first installed the mats. The peace of mind I get knowing my floors are safe from daily abuse is, honestly, priceless.

**Eco-Friendly and Family-Safe Features**

One feature that particularly impressed me was the eco-friendly, non-toxic material. I always worry about chemical odors or skid-prone textures when it comes to car mats, especially with two small kids constantly kicking the back seat or spilling their snacks. These mats stayed secure with their textured, non-slip design, and I didn’t detect even the faintest chemical smell upon opening the box or after hours of exposure under direct sunlight. They’re flexible yet tough enough to handle the surprisingly sharp claws of my enthusiastic dog!

**Merits**

- Custom fit for the Tesla Model 3 Highland—no gaps or slips.
- Effective at containing spills, mud, and debris, keeping the car interior immaculate.
- Eco-friendly, odor-free TPE material that feels sturdy yet flexible.
- Non-slip textured backing for added security while driving.
- Easy to clean—wipe, hose, or shake, and they’re as good as new.

**Areas of Improvement**

- While installation was straightforward, the mats are slightly heavier than expected (23.5 pounds), which might make removing them cumbersome for some users.
- The product box had no written cleaning tips or detailed instructions, though it’s mostly intuitive.
- Some users online reported compatibility issues if their trunk had custom organizers. I didn’t experience this because my setup is fairly standard, but it’s worth noting.

**Competing Products**

I’ve tried other floor mats before, including WeatherTech and 3D MAXpider, both of which are household names when it comes to car protection. While I’ve admired WeatherTech’s rugged toughness and MAXpider’s modern aesthetics, I found this product offered an excellent blend of form and functionality. WeatherTech mats, for instance, tend to fall short in custom fitting Tesla’s unique interior, and MAXpider mats, in my experience, are harder to clean. By comparison, this 6-piece set nailed the custom-fit aspect while maintaining both durability and ease of care. The raised edge on these mats also seemed higher, which helped in keeping spills from leaking over—something I’ve struggled with when using other brands.

**Quality for Price**

One thing I always evaluate is whether a product justifies its price point. While it's clear these mats aren't the cheapest option, their durability, fitment precision, and family-friendly material make them a worthwhile investment. Considering the park outings, grocery runs, and cross-state drives I’ve put them through, they’ve held up way better than generic mats I’d previously purchased. You’re not just buying mats—you’re protecting your $45k+ car investment. To me, that makes sense value-wise.

1mrxxcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mrxxcm/emotional_affair_can_we_work_through_it/,"Emotional affair, can we work through it?","Background, me almost 30/F, and my fiancé almost 29/M. 8 years together. Very rarely fight, we have been through a lot together, he tells me he loves me often, calls me every day after work or on the way to work. I have been his number one confidant. On the very brink of buying a house. He has never given me any reason to mistrust him around other women, he works in healthcare and his industry is female dominated. I have always had the impression that he was a very honourable person. 

He Met a woman (22/F, let’s call her Sarah) at work 5 weeks ago, they seemed to get along at work and also happened to be also contacting each other over Facebook messenger, she initiated with positive feedback. I noticed her name on his phone frequently but because I’ve never felt insecure about women in his life I didn’t read into it. I also don’t usually feel the need to go through his phone. 

3 weeks ago, we had a stressful day house hunting. We had some conflict, I was overwhelmed and asked for him to come to the table so to speak (I take on all of the household and emotional labour, I’m also the breadwinner) the next day, he kind of almost instigated a breakup, said he’s been feeling confused about how he feels about me and he thinks if he loved me he would do the washing. The next day he tried to reconcile and said he was just stressed. And maybe not really ready to buy a house. However I am still feeling hurt and now insecure about the state of my relationship. 

The next night he had a night shift. The next day after that things were still sore for us, a bit strained and I am still feeling hurt. He mentioned that someone messaged him but was elusive with their name. “Oh just a nurse from work” which was an odd thing that flagged for me. He had never had an issue using coworkers names before. I became very insecure and anxious all of a sudden. I grabbed my keys just to take myself out of the situation. He followed me to my car to talk and I flagged that he was avoiding using her name, Sarah. He didn’t really react. I then had a shower and zoned out in my room. He came in later to talk and he continued on with feeling conflicted about his feelings in our relationship. I asked him outright that if Sarah had anything to do with it, he confirmed it. That was incredibly painful. 

I left for work the next day. I then stayed away for the next 4 days. During this time We did talk on the phone occasionally, and I messaged his friends to check in on him and see if he was ok, and to also report back to me on his headspace. One friend mentioned that it does seem to be this girl, Sarah, and a possible workplace crush. (She has also blocked me on instagram for no apparent or verifiable reason) After 4 days I went back to the house to pick up some more clothes and he wanted to talk. He bought up couples therapy (I had requested it on the first night we had conflict) he also bought up that he read up on emotional affairs and he believes he maybe crossed a line with Sarah, I asked what he said that would cross a line. He said that when he complemented her on her academic accomplishments she returned it with a compliment on his own upcoming achievements of buying a house and being engaged. He replied to her by maybe expressing some dissatisfaction with the situation. I haven’t seen the messages. But that day he told me he had stopped talking to her. And personally If that is all that was said, I believe I can move past it. But when I pushed on resolution, as in going ahead with couples therapy, he pulled away again, expressed it was too hard or too much effort. I then looked him in the eyes, and said “I don’t think this is going to work out between us” he then tried to be affectionate again, signalling that he still would like to work on things. I gathered my things and left. He kissed me sweetly as I was in my car about to leave and told me he loves me. I have been staying with my mum since 

The next day, he called and said he wants to work on things. However he also had a stressful test/interview coming up and he wanted my opinion. As mentioned earlier, I have been his confidant, I have been the only person he has shared his anxieties with, I am reliable. For that week - Monday through to Thursday (the day of the test) we had short and sweet phone calls. Not much relationship talk, because I found it painful, but it was nice to hear his voice again and not get off the phone crying. Instead we spoke about how he would prepare for his test and I gave some gentle encouragement. 

On Thursday, the day of the test, he passed with flying colours. He also locked his phone and keys in his car in another city, he called me from a strangers phone and I organised a lock smith for him. He gets into his car and he also gets a call with a job offer in a really competitive industry, with the offer for 2 locations, one was 90 minutes drive from home, the other was 50 minutes drive from home. They gave him a 30 minute window to accept the offer with his choice of location. He chose the location closest to home. When he got back to our hometown I suggested we meet for lunch to celebrate. Lunch was initially very nice and positive. After a little while though he started to internally regret his decision on location, as the population is the smaller of the two locations (3000 population vs 10,000 population) and he was concerned about his experience building. He started spiraling into anxiety and I tried to calm him. However he then started turning his mood onto me. I left crying. He called a few hours later and apologised. 

The next day on the Friday we had a little more contact, he knew that during our time apart I had sought out mental health support and I had my first appointment that morning. He called before it, and then requested that I call him back after. After my psych appointment I decided not to call, instead I went shopping and bought myself some expensive moisturiser. When I was driving home he called me. His tone seemed a little anxious. He Mentioned there was some mail for me so I drove by to pick it up. We had a pleasant interaction and then I left. He had another night shift that night. 

Later that evening a girl friend of mine called to check in on me, I gave her a brief rundown and she then asked if I would like her to check if he and Sarah are following each other on Instagram (last time we checked - Monday that week - they weren’t following each other) I said yes, so she checked. And they’re following each other. I felt myself becoming increasingly anxious and insecure again. And I messaged him “have you been using me this week for emotional support, with no actual intention of reconciling?” But I then quickly unsent it. 
He saw the “unsent message” and called me while on shift. Because I was spiralling I asked him outright 
“Are you now following Sarah?” “Yes”
“Are you talking to her again” “yes”
“Have you just used me all week for emotional support?” “No, not at all. I’m at work I can’t talk right now” and we ended the conversation. 
That night I could barely sleep. 

The next morning (Saturday) around 10:30 am (he would have gone to bed at 6:30am) I drove to his house (his mums house, where we used to live together while we were saving to buy a property) and woke him up. I kind of freaked out on him. I asked to go through the messages. He said no it’s a breach of privacy. I said he lied to me, he denied lying because he did stop talking to her for a few days, but then replied to her message and continued talking consistently, but tried to assure me it was nothing inappropriate and work related. I cried. I was a mess. He still gave me affection and didn’t want me to leave and was trying to be sweet. He says he still wants to work on things and that he will “think about it” regarding the messages. He called later in the day and suggested we go to a housewarming party we were both already invited to, as a chance to reconnect and maybe have a nice time. I decided to go because I already bought the friend some gifts I wanted to give her. Problem was they’re all his friends. And usually I’m fine with that when I have a lot of self confidence, but that night I definitely had zero confidence. And as soon as we get there, there’s a few familiar faces but a bunch of new people too, and he doesn’t introduce me at all. I ended up having a panic attack. There was another plus one that saw me and I told her what’s going on. She said she wouldn’t tell anyone but apparently she did. Anyway the party sucked for me but everyone else seemed to have fun. When he did come and eventually talk to me we were with 2 other people chatting and his phone was next to him. And guess who he gets a message from? Sarah… he locks his phone quickly and I just go non verbal. We left the party shortly after and had more arguments on the way home. He is refusing to completely cut contact or even limit contact because he doesn’t want to make it weird at work (he does work at a really gossipy branch) he tells me the messages are completely innocent and almost entirely work related, but will not let me verify by reading the messages. I can’t really remember much because of heightened emotions but we Tried to calm it and reconcile slightly when we get back to his place. We talk, we start kissing, maybe initiate sex, he says before we actually do anything “if we have sex it doesn’t mean we’re working on getting back together” so I stop. He stands up, and just opens the door for me to leave. I was just so shocked he must have read my face. He shuts the door and says “that’s harsh I’m sorry” I can’t really remember how we stopped fighting but when I went to leave he tried to be affectionate again. Asked me to message him in the morning. 

On Sunday I went to work and we texted general small talk. After work I went there just to see how I feel when I look at him. And there’s still love in my heart for him. He said that (the person whose house warming it was) just called and complained about me. Apparently I ruined her party and multiple people complained. I didn’t really say anything to that. Then I told him that I don’t want to continue this and that I’ll let him know when I have a place to live so I can pick up my stuff. Then he protests about the breakup. Wants couples counselling. We’ve been low contact since. Short phone calls each day. I slowed down on initiating contact, he would call me most of the time. That was Sunday  to Wednesday.

By Wednesday afternoon something just snapped in me. On my drive home from work I just screamed in the car. I applied for a new passport and I’m booking flights to Italy for October. He called around 4:30pm and I just couldn’t help but be short with him. I wanted to hear from him all day, wanted to know that he was thinking about me and cared for me. But when he called me I couldn’t get the anger out of my heart. I told him I deserve better. I reminded him of all the times I’ve let him go through my messages with guys who message me about MMA. (Side note I’m an MMA fighter, I’m also quite conventionally attractive without being vain)
How he has expressed jealousy over attention I was getting from one particular guy and I immediately cut him off. And that he’s not willing to do that for me. He asked well do you still want couples counselling and do you still want to work on things? I told him yes I do, but I don’t like that it’ll be entirely my responsibility to seek out a therapist, and book the appointment, make sure the appointment works for his schedule, and then probably pay for it too. He says he wishes to talk more that night. I said if he wants to he can call, he knows I will finish work at 10pm. I gave myself a mental check out time of 10:15pm. If he doesn’t call before then I turn off my phone. He called at 10:10 and said he understood what I was saying and he will take the lead with booking couples counseling. I told him honestly that I was relieved to hear that.

I have now resigned myself to just data collecting at this point, I will no longer chase, or initiate any contact. 

Thursday he had a very big day at work, did a lot of overtime and called late in the evening. He bought up couples counseling unprompted, but said he hadn’t had time to look into it. 

On Friday he also had a big day at work and called late in the evening, when he bought up couples counseling unprompted I asked for us to have something booked in by end of day Monday as I don’t like being in this limbo. He agreed. He then asked if we could catch up for a coffee the next day after I finish work at 2pm. Coffee shops close at 3:30 where we live. I agreed, and told him to contact me after 2pm if he would like to catch up face to face. 

Saturday (today) At 2:15pm he called and we made conversation. We then met for a coffee at 2:45pm it was pleasant, I don’t want to get into anything too heavy so we don’t. He kind of mentioned buying property again but I just didn’t engage in that part of the conversation and he dropped it. We met and talked for an hour before I told him it’s time to wrap it up. He walked me to my car. As we were there he leaned in for a kiss, a small kiss. It felt awkward but nice. And that brings us to now. I’m feeling anxious still, and very conflicted. I love him deeply, and don’t want to let go. But I’m so scared that by Monday he wouldn’t have booked anything, and he’s still communicating with Sarah, and I’m worried I’m being taken for a ride. 

I am thinking about presenting an ultimatum, 

Option A. allow me to verify his words by letting me read through their messages. If what he is saying is the truth we can work through it with a therapist. 

Option B. He refuses to let me see the messages and our relationship is now over, however I will still be seeking closure by reaching out to Sarah and asking for the context of the messages",0,1755356927.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

1mrxw2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1mrxw2v/my_nonbacterial_journey/,My nonbacterial journey …,"I developed prostatitis shortly after taking the second dose of the vaccine.  Parallel to that, I experienced some job stress (got a promotion that I didn’t want).  My symptoms appeared out of left field and came on hard.  Burning when I would pee, always feeling like I had to pee, turtling, and a feeling that my urethra was turning inside out.  I was ALWAYS uncomfortable and adjusting myself.  Car rides were the WORST and ejaculation during sex was painful.  

I found short term relief with probiotics and antibiotics, but spent a couple years in agony.  

Probably two years in I’d discovered the two things that had the biggest positive impact were flushing (drinking large volumes of water) and salads.  Eating a big salad was kinda like taking a Tums for my urinary tract.  Conversely, coffee, chocolate, spicy anything, and alcohol were like putting acid directly into my urinary tract.  

Using this knowledge, I started making a morning spinach protein smoothie.  I got mad results out of this and feel like I lived a couple years in limbo.  Mostly low symptom days … even had a few days here and there that I barely even noticed or remembered.  It’s important to note that I’d developed DE (delayed ejaculation) and had minimized sensation.  During this phase, I experimented with removing sugar (no bread, no sweets at all, drank black coffee, and more).  There was a correlation.  

One day I put two and two together and decided my couple times a week Diet Coke caused minor flare up symptoms (as did strong coffee in some coffee shops, stress, and extra spicy food) … but I bounced back to low symptom days quickly.  

At this point I decided to stop drinking anything that wasn’t clear (except coffee) and completely removed artificial sweeteners.  On the rare occasion I had a soda, I switched to full calorie Sprite, ginger ale, etc.  That was a HUGE step forward.   At this point, I was experience more no symptom days than not … but still had flare ups after too much coffee, dehydration, or stress.  Most chocolate and spicy foods stopped bothering me.  I’d occasionally react to REALLY hot foods, but I was getting more and more of my life back.  In other words, that Diet Coke a couple times a week was causing a disproportional percentage of the flare ups.  

THEN one day I decided that if cutting Diet Coke out was good, cutting back on coffee from 16 oz in the AM and 12 in the PM to a single 8 oz cup a day was worth trying.  That took a couple weeks of making cuts (reduced afternoon, then reduced morning, then removed afternoon, then further reduced morning).  I noticed IMMEDIATE results.  At this point, if I’m really dehydrated due to back to back to back meetings, I’ll feel it a little bit … but I can pound water and feel better within an hour.  Otherwise I’m 99% symptom free. AND I’d always thought I had a small bladder … bluntly, I have to pee more than the average 6foot 200 pound guy.  When I reduced coffe to 8oz a day, ALL of that needing to pee all the time went away.  Example … if I get on a flight, I usually pee before boarding … but once we’re up and leveled off, I’m thinking about going.  Not hurting by any means … but I’m looking for the bathroom.  With the coffee reduction, I recently made a 3 hour flight and didn’t pee till I was on the ground.  Didn’t even occur to me.  

And most recently I decided to hypercharge some pelvic floor therapies … specifically with a massage gun on a low setting on and around the pelvic floor … along with the standard stretches.  Not only am I symptom free, but my balls don’t feel as swollen and I don’t feel as much of the dull “testicular torsion” pain in my scrotum/kidneys (right side for me).  AND I’m regaining some sensation during sex.  

I took you guys on a too long trip there … but I’d did so hoping something would resonate among the way.  

My final thoughts (my theory only) are that the reason I’d felt like I had acid in my urinary tract is because I did, in fact, have acid in my urinary tract (coffee, chocolate, Diet Coke, alcohol, too many sweets).  Today, I drink ONE 8 oz cup of coffee a day, period.  No Diet Coke ever.  And I’ve moderated my alcohol intake from a couple glasses of wine while cooking dinner every night to drinking two glasses per week on nights out.  I pretty much eat whatever chocolate or spicy food I want with zero impact.  I still eat a ton of greens (or include them in my smoothie) and drink more water than the average person.  

Conclusion … it’s not JUST caffeine … it’s acid making foods.  Decaf coffee and caffeine free coke didn’t help me.  So in the final analysis, my fix was stopping/limiting acid producing foods, hydration, stress management, and pelvic floor protocols.  

If/when more sensation comes back and ALL testicular torsion feelings go away, I will consider this a full recovery.   

Hoping this helps one of you.  ",2,1755356851.0,Prostatitis,1,0.75,False
1mrxvzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1mrxvzt/explore_the_best_overtherange_microwave_ge/,Explore the Best Over-the-Range Microwave GE JVM6175SKSS Review,"I’ve been putting the GE JVM6175SKSS to the test in my kitchen over the past couple of weeks, and I’ve got to say, this over-the-range microwave offers some notable upsides while leaving room for a few improvements. As someone who uses their microwave daily, this appliance has had its fair share of frozen leftovers, steaming mugs of tea, and (unsuccessful) popcorn experiments to deal with. Let me walk you through the highs and lows of this stainless steel contender.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this microwave is just how good it looks. With its stainless steel finish and clean design, it fit seamlessly into my modern kitchen setup. The 30-inch size worked perfectly with my over-the-range space. At 52 pounds, it wasn’t the lightest thing to install, but once secured, it felt incredibly sturdy. I particularly enjoy the recessed turntable feature, making the interior feel spacious and accommodating for larger dishes. Little touches like the upfront charcoal filter with indicator light caught my attention too—practical and thoughtful.

**Straightforward Installation**  
Installing the microwave was relatively painless, although I did have my neighbor come over for a quick assist because holding it up in place while securing screws is no solo task. It’s a standard over-the-range installation process, and it even comes with convertible venting, allowing some flexibility in how it's set up. This is a lifesaver if you’re like me and your kitchen’s venting isn’t as straightforward as it should be.

**Great Cooking Features for Everyday Use**  
The array of settings and features really stands out once you start using it. The sensor cooking controls are a game-changer when you’re feeling lazy or just unsure of timing. I loved it when making quick steamed veggies or reheating rice without guessing cook times. There’s also a defrost feature that either works by time or weight. I tested it out with chicken, and it surprised me by defrosting pretty evenly compared to my older microwave. The “add 30 seconds” button? It has become my best friend when I’m frantically trying to get my coffee warm (again) before rushing out the door.

**Energy Usage and Power**  
Running at 1000 watts, this microwave provides enough power to cook food efficiently. Meals that used to take over five minutes in my last unit now take noticeably less time. The 1.7 cubic feet capacity also doesn’t feel cramped; I can easily fit larger casserole dishes and most regular-sized dinner plates without stressing about things getting stuck. For someone like me who’s impatient while cooking, speed and space are everything.

[Check GE JVM6175SKSS price on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b01lm1v31a/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Stylish stainless steel design that upgrades your kitchen’s look.  
- Convenient sensor cooking that simplifies meal prep.  
- Powerful 1000-watt output ensures quick, effective cooking.  
- Spacious interior with a recessed turntable.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Ventilation fan on the higher setting can get pretty noisy, especially in an open-concept space.  
- The control panel isn’t backlit, which makes it tricky to see buttons in dim lighting.  
- Installation may require an extra set of hands due to weight and positioning.  

**Rival Brands in the Market**  
Comparing this model to other over-the-range microwaves, like Samsung’s ME19R7041FS or LG’s LMV2031ST, the GE JVM6175SKSS holds its own well. It doesn’t pack the same abundance of smart tech features you’d find in some Samsung models, such as app connectivity, but comes through on reliability and consistent performance, which is sometimes more important for everyday users. It edges out models like the Whirlpool WMH31017HS in offering better defrosting and more intuitive cooking controls. However, competitors like LG are still a bit quieter and include better light options on the control panel.

**Quality for Price**  
Given how well it performs in terms of power and daily cooking efficiency, this microwave offers solid quality for its price range. It doesn’t burden you with unnecessary bells and whistles, focusing instead on core functions that most people actually use. Although I feel the noise from the vent fan and unlit control panel could use some tweaking, its durable build and thoughtful features make it worth the investment for a functional kitchen essential.

Chapter 1: Those Who Came from the Void
May 2, 2077, Southern Observatory, Atacama Desert, Chile

Dr. Aris Thorne hated anomalies. His universe was one of elegant, predictable mathematics. Planets orbited, starlight bent around massive objects exactly as old Einstein had predicted, and the echo of the Big Bang was a soothing, constant hum in the background of space. Anomalies were like a false note in a perfect symphony. And the one that had just blossomed on his screens was like the roar of a circular saw in a philharmonic hall.

""It's impossible,"" he whispered, stepping away from the monitor as if a physical heat radiated from it.

On the main display, which gathered data from a network of radio telescopes, four dots ripped through the velvet blackness of space. They weren't comets or stray asteroids. Their signature was... artificial. Pure. But that wasn't the anomaly. The anomaly was their velocity and vector.

""Entry velocity... zero point five c,"" his assistant, Kenji, muttered, his face pale as paper. ""Deceleration... That's physically impossible.""

He was right. To decelerate from half the speed of light to relative rest in just a few hours would require energy beyond anything humanity could imagine. It would produce gamma radiation that should have fried everything for billions of kilometers. And yet, these four objects did just that. They slowed in the deep orbit of Mars as if parking a car, leaving behind only subtle ripples in space-time that only Aris's instruments could detect.

For the next twenty-four hours, the scientific world fell into a state of quiet, controlled panic. Confirmations poured in from every observatory on Earth and the Moon. JPL, ESA, Roscosmos - they all saw the same thing. Four unknown objects, each about two kilometers long, with smooth, black hulls that seemed to absorb light.

And then they moved again. This time slowly, majestically, heading toward the third planet from the Sun.

UN Headquarters, New York

The Security Council chamber had never been so quiet. The enormous screen, which usually displayed maps of disputed territories or the faces of dictators, now displayed an image from the orbiting Hubble-7 telescope. Four objects, sharp as obsidian daggers, hovered high above Earth. Their formation was perfect - the vertices of a perfect tetrahedron, encircling the planet in a geometric embrace.

UN Secretary-General Anya Sharma felt the eyes of everyone present on her. Generals, ambassadors, advisors. Everyone waited for her words, as if she could make sense of the unimaginable.

""Reports confirm they are not responding to any attempts at contact,"" she said in a calm, composed voice that cost her every ounce of willpower. ""Military early warning systems are on high alert, but..."" She hesitated for a moment, ""...the objects show no hostile intent. No combat scans, no targeting. They are simply there.""

""They are watching,"" General Marcus Thorne, representative of the Planetary Defense Force, interjected curtly. His namesake from the Atacama had provided him with the initial data, and the general hadn't slept since. ""They are waiting. The question is what for.""

They didn't have to wait long for an answer.

In that instant, every screen in the room flickered. The global communications network, the lifeblood of human civilization in the 21st century, had been hijacked. From televisions in the slums of Mumbai, to telephones in Tokyo, to holographic billboards in Times Square just outside the window-everything went dark for a split second, only to flash a single image a moment later.

It wasn't an image of ships. It wasn't an alien face. It was a symbol. An intricate, hexagonal pattern, reminiscent of a snowflake, a honeycomb, and the diagram of a complex organic molecule. It was mesmerizing and utterly inhuman.

And then came the voice.

It wasn't a sound in the traditional sense. It seemed to resonate directly in the mind, bypassing the ears. It spoke in all the major languages of Earth simultaneously, yet without cacophony. Everyone heard it in their own native tongue, perfectly clear and distinct. The voice was calm, synthetic, devoid of any emotion. It resembled the rustle of a dry leaf or the soft click of chitinous armor.

""We are the Swarm. We have been observing your electromagnetic signatures since your species learned to throw sparks into the night.""

A deadly silence fell on the Security Council chamber. Someone dropped a tablet behind them, and the sound of the screen cracking was like a gunshot.

""Your development is... rapid. Chaotic. You have reached a critical point. You stand on the threshold of the stars, not yet fully understanding the ocean you are about to sail.""

The images of the ships on the main screen returned. Now that they knew who they were dealing with, their appearance took on a new, disturbing meaning. These were not streamlined, metal structures. Their hulls were segmented.They were built like the carapaces of giant insects. Long, thin structures jutted out at odd angles, like antennae or legs. These were insectoid ships, constructed with a cold, alien logic.

""We do not come to judge. We do not come to conquer. We come to engage in discourse.""

The swarm symbol dominated the screen again.

""Appoint your representatives. Speak with one voice. We await your signal. We await the United Nations.""

The transmission ended as abruptly as it had begun. The screens returned to normal. The global network belonged to humans once again. But the world would never be the same.

The room was stunned. General Thorne clenched his fists so tightly that his knuckles turned white. The ambassadors looked at each other with a mixture of fear and excitement.

Anya Sharma looked at the hexagonal symbol already burned into her retina. She felt the weight of eight billion human lives on her shoulders. First contact wasn't a shout or a gunshot. It was an invitation. A summons to a stage humanity hadn't even known existed.

""Well..."" she said quietly, her voice, though trembling, carrying throughout the room. ""It seems we have a meeting to arrange.""


Chapter 2: The Gift of the Swarm
May 9, 2077, Office of the Secretary-General, United Nations Headquarters, New York

A week. Seven days that shook the world more than any war or cataclysm in human history. For seven days, four obsidian ships hung silently in orbit, and humanity held its breath. Stock markets froze, borders became meaningless, and all disputes and conflicts shrank to the size of schoolyard arguments in the face of the overwhelming presence of the Swarm.

Anya Sharma felt as if she had aged a decade. Her office had become a global nerve center. She slept on a camp couch, subsisted on coffee and military rations, and her only interlocutors were world leaders, scientists, and generals. Everyone asked the same question: ""What now?"" And she had no answer.

Humanity tried to answer the call. A representative council was being hastily formed, but the process was bogged down in political wrangling. Who would represent Earth? By what right? The Hive waited, and humanity, as usual, argued over who should get to the door first.

Today, however, the silence was broken.

It happened without warning. The main terminal on Anya's desk, the most secure communication device on the planet, flickered and displayed the hexagonal symbol of the Hive. There was no alarm, no sign of intrusion. It simply was there.

And then that dry, rustling, impossibly calm voice echoed in her head again.

""Secretary General Anya Sharma. We observe your efforts. Your social structure is... fractal. Complex. We admire its intricacy, though it hinders coherent action.""

Anya felt her heart leap into her throat. She was alone in the room, but she felt as if the entire universe were speaking to her.

""This is Anya Sharma. I represent the United Nations. We are working to establish a council that can speak to you on behalf of all humanity.""

""We understand. Time is a precious resource for you. For us, it is... a variable. We want to facilitate this process. We want to demonstrate our intent. Not through words, which your species often empties of meaning, but through action.""

""What action?"" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

""We consider this a gift.""

The symbol on the screen disappeared, replaced by a real-time image of Earth from orbit. Anya saw four black daggers of ships. Suddenly, one of them, the one hovering over the Pacific, began to move. It left its position in the tetrahedron and slowly, with incredible precision, began to lower its orbit, entering the upper atmosphere.

General Thorne burst into her office without knocking, his face a mask of disbelief and horror. ""Madam Secretary!"" One of them is descending! It's not responding to any calls! Should we locate it?

""Wait!"" Anya ordered, not taking her eyes off the screen. ""They want us to watch.""

The Hive ship, like a giant black beetle, began circling the planet along the equator. From its underside, thousands of microscopic holes began to release aerosol. It wasn't thick smoke or a cloud of gas. It was a faint, iridescent haze that caught the sunlight, creating ephemeral, rainbow-colored streaks across the sky, visible from South America to Indonesia. It looked like the aurora borealis dancing in broad daylight.

The transmission lasted an hour. The ship circled Earth once, leaving behind a shimmering, almost invisible veil that slowly descended, dissipating into the stratosphere. Then, with the same impossible grace, it rose back to its place in the formation.

And then the reports began to pour in.

The first came from the Global Climate Monitoring Center in Geneva. Their sensors had gone haywire. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were falling at a rate that defied the laws of chemistry. In a single hour, they had fallen by five percentage points.

Another report, this time from a base in Antarctica. The ozone hole, a long-standing wound in the planet's protective shield, was shrinking. Before scientists' eyes, ozone molecules were regenerating at an incredible speed.

Observatories around the world confirmed this data. The average global temperature, which had risen inexorably for a century, began to fall. Not abruptly, but steadily. By a fraction of a degree per hour. Computer models that had predicted catastrophe just yesterday now showed the impossible: a return to pre-industrial climate conditions in less than a week.

The swarm hadn't attacked. It hadn't destroyed. The swarm had cleaned up.

Anya Sharma sank into her chair, feeling her legs give way beneath her. In a single hour, an alien civilization had resolved the greatest crisis humanity had ever faced. In a single gesture, they had reversed a century of destruction. They had saved glaciers, coral reefs, and millions of lives that were about to be swept away by rising oceans and extreme weather events.

It was a gift. A gift of unimaginable value.

But it was also a display of power so absolute it was chilling. A power that could surgically Manipulate the entire biosphere of the planet with such precision. A force that made the human nuclear arsenal seem like a handful of firecrackers.

The voice in her head spoke one last time, quiet and final.

""We hope this gesture will facilitate your deliberations. We await your unified voice.""

The screen returned to normal.

Anya stared at the blank monitor, but all she saw was a bill. The Swarm had given humanity a gift, but no one in their right mind believed it was free. They had freed them from the consequences of their own sins, but at the same time, they had placed an invisible leash around their necks.

Now humanity owed them something. And Anya Sharma, Secretary General of Planet Earth, had no idea what the price of this debt would be.

Chapter 3: A Conversation of Gods and Insects
May 10, 2077, Secure Apartment, New York

The apartment was sterile and impersonal, one of many safe havens the Planetary Defense Force maintained for its top command. General Marcus Thorne poured two glasses of the amber liquid. He handed one to his brother, Aris. They both stood at the panoramic window overlooking Manhattan, illuminated by the night. From this height, the city looked like a circuit board, pulsing with energy and life. Life that, just two days ago, was heading toward inevitable catastrophe.

""Explain this to me, Aris,"" Marcus finally said, breaking the long silence. His voice, usually firm and resonant, was now soft, almost strangled. ""No scientific jargon. As if you were explaining it to a complete idiot. Because that's exactly how I feel.""

Aris Thorne, the man who had first seen the shadows of the Hive on his screens, took a long swig of whiskey. He looked bone-weary. His civilian clothes, slightly rumpled from another twenty-four-hour analysis session, contrasted with his brother's impeccably pressed uniform.

""Idiots don't ask questions like that, Marcus,"" he replied quietly. ""Where do I begin? With half-light-speed deceleration, which should generate more energy than a thousand suns? Or with an aerosol that rewrote the chemistry of an entire planet in an hour?""

""Start with the latter. With 'gift.'"" Marcus practically spat the word out. ""My analysts claim they used some form of advanced catalysts.""

Aris smiled bitterly. ""Your analysts are like cavemen who found a smartphone and are trying to describe it as a 'magic, shiny stone.' It wasn't an aerosol in our sense of the word. It wasn't a cloud of chemicals.""

He set down his glass and looked at his brother. His eyes, usually filled with scientific curiosity, now burned with a mixture of fascination and primal fear.

""It had to be nanotechnology. A swarm of microscopic, programmable machines. Billions of billions of machines, each smaller than a virus, released into the atmosphere. Each one had a simple task: find a carbon dioxide molecule and rupture it. Find a hole in the ozone layer and repair it by fusing oxygen atoms. It was... a swarm in the fog. A true Swarm.""

Marcus remained silent, processing the information. His military mind immediately jumped from ""how"" to ""what.""

""So it wasn't a climate weapon,"" he said. ""It was terraforming technology. Used on an inhabited planet.""

""Even more,"" Aris continued, his voice growing increasingly animated. ""Think about it."" If you can create nanites that break down CO₂, you can just as easily create ones that break down H₂O. They could have turned our oceans into a desert. Or ones that attack nitrogen compounds, destroying our entire biosphere. Or worse... ones that attack the double helix of DNA.

A heavy silence fell on the room. The view of the bustling city outside the window suddenly took on a fragile, temporary quality.

""They could have wiped us all out without firing a shot,"" Marcus whispered. ""They could have reprogrammed us like a computer, turned us into something else. Or simply broken us down into our basic elements.""

""Exactly. Now think of it this way,"" Aris added, moving closer to the window. ""They didn't use a gun, Marcus. They used a gardening tool. They fixed our climate with the same ease we pull weeds. To them, we're... ants."" And they have just removed from our path the poison we ourselves had planted. Not out of anger, not out of love. With the indifference of someone simply tending to their garden.

This comparison struck the general harder than any tactical analysis. The feeling of helplessness was overwhelming. His entire world, built on strategy, force, and deterrence, crumbled to dust. How do you fight someone whose weapon is pure matter? How do you deter someone who can stop light?

""So this gift..."" Marcus began. ""It was a statement. 'We are gods, and you are insects. Don't try to fight us, or we will crush you without you even noticing.'""

""Perhaps,"" Aris admitted. ""Or perhaps it really was just a gift. Perhaps they thought we wouldn't be able to speak to them, busy putting out our own fire. We don't know their motivations. And that, brother, is the most terrifying thing. We don't know if we're dealing with gods or just infinitely more advanced insects.""

Marcus Thorne, commander of the Planetary Defense Force, the man tasked with protecting Earth from every threat, finished his whiskey in one gulp. The fire of the alcohol was nothing compared to the icy fear that gripped his gut.

""It doesn't matter who they are,"" he said firmly, setting the empty glass on the table with a soft thud. ""My job is to prepare for war, even if we have no chance of winning it. I need to know their hypothetical options. All of them.""

Aris nodded, his eyes filled with infinite sadness. I could make you a list. But that would be like writing down all the ways the ocean could drown you. The possibilities are endless. And we're just learning to swim.

Chapter 4: A Face in the Hive
May 15, 2077, Human Council Situation Room, United Nations Headquarters, New York

The room was new, constructed within the last week in the deepest, most secure levels of the UN building. There was no mahogany table or historical flags. Instead, twelve armchairs surrounded a circular, black platform. In front of each armchair, an interactive holographic screen floated in midair. It was a sanctuary for humanity, hastily cobbled together to face the unknown.

Anya Sharma occupied the center seat. On her sides sat the members of the newly formed Human Council-not politicians, but the planet's greatest thinkers: a chief ethicist from Kyoto University, a leading economic strategist from Lagos, a philosopher from Buenos Aires, a biologist from the Pasteur Institute.

On one of the side screens, in a split window, two faces appeared. One belonged to General Marcus Thorne-his features were as hard as granite, his eyes analyzing everything with cold precision. The other, belonging to his brother Aris, expressed nervous, almost joyful anticipation. They were the Council's key advisors, the voices of strength and reason.

They waited. The entire world waited, though only the twelve in the room would witness what was to come.

Precisely at the appointed hour, the main screen in front of Anya flickered. The mesmerizing hexagonal symbol of the Hive appeared again. And once again, the synthetic, calm voice echoed in the minds of everyone present.

""Council of Humanity. Secretary General. Your structure is ready. We accept this format as the basis for further discourse.""

""On behalf of the Council and the nations of United Earth, we welcome you,"" Anya replied, her voice a model of composure. ""We are ready to begin the dialogue.""

""Dialogue requires mutual understanding. And understanding requires breaking down barriers. The greatest barrier is anonymity. It breeds distrust. Your species, in particular, reacts with fear to what it cannot see. Therefore, it is time for you to see us.""

Anya's heart quickened. She glanced at the Council members. As one, they leaned forward, staring at the screen. Even the preview of General Thorne's face showed tension.

The Hive symbol slowly faded, giving way to blackness. Then the image brightened.

The bridge of a starship, as we would normally understand it, did not appear. There were no consoles, buttons, or flashing lights. The background was organic, ivory, with delicate, pulsating lines of light running along the walls. It resembled the interior of a living being.

A figure stood in the center of the frame.

The instinctive reaction in the room was a collective, silent gasp. It was shock, but not revulsion. The figure was so alien and yet so... elegant that it defied simple categories of fear.

It was tall and slender, resembling an Earthly mantis carved by a master from polished jadeite white. Its body rested on four thin but strong legs, providing it with unshakable stability. From its upright torso sprouted two upper limbs - arms, delicate and precise, terminating in intricate, three-fingered hands. They moved slowly, with a fluid, inhuman grace.

But it was the head that commanded all attention. Large, triangular, set on a thin neck, it was dominated by a pair of enormous, faceted eyes. They were as black as the void of space, yet shimmered with a thousand inner reflections, giving the impression of infinite depth and intelligence. No mouth was visible; only small, complex mandibles moved rhythmically beneath the head, emitting a quiet, almost melodic clicking sound.

""Amazing..."" whispered Aris Thorne on his channel, his voice filled with pure, scientific wonder. ""Convergent evolution in its purest form. Upright posture, specialized limbs, the head as a sensory center... It makes sense. It's beautiful.""

""Note the joint structure and potential weak points of the chitinous carapace,"" his brother, the general, murmured in response.

The creature on screen tilted its head slightly. The movement was fluid, curious, like a bird's.

""I am the individual designated for this contact. In your terminology, you may call me Speaker.""

The voice was the same - impersonal, synthetic, resonating in the head. The sound did not come from clicking mandibles. It was another element of dissonance, reminding the humans of the advanced life form they were dealing with.

""We understand that our biological form is new to you. Your limbic systems are now generating warning signals. This is an expected and natural reaction. There is nothing in it that would offend us.""

This cold, analytical assessment of their own fear was more disturbing than any display of aggression. It showed how thoroughly the Hive had studied them.

Anya Sharma finally found her voice. Her role as leader of humanity demanded that she speak first.

""Speaker,"" she began, trying to keep her voice steady. ""Thank you. Thank you for this... act of transparency. We are honored to see you.

The speaker remained motionless for a long moment. His large, black eyes seemed to gaze at each Council member simultaneously, penetrating them.

""Honor is a concept related to social hierarchy. We do not possess it. However, we consider it a necessary and productive step. The purpose of this meeting was to establish visual contact. This goal has been achieved. Familiarizing yourself with our form will facilitate future interactions. We will continue our dialogue once your Council has processed this data.""

With these words, the image flickered and disappeared, replaced once again by the static, hexagonal symbol of the Hive, which also faded a moment later, leaving a black, blank screen.

Absolute silence fell on the room. The dialogue had begun. But this was a conversation with a being so fundamentally different that they might as well have been conversing with a living mathematical theorem, a being of pure, terrifying logic clad in porcelain armor.

Anya looked at the faces of her advisors. They all had the same expression: a mixture of admiration, fear, and a deep, unsettling question.

How do you negotiate with something like that? And what on earth do they actually want?

I haven’t finished the game yet, so this isn’t a full review. But based on what I’ve experienced so far, it’s been a whole lot of... not much.

The pitch totally hooked me: “Lovecraft meets Papers, Please.” How do you not get curious after hearing that? But I’m currently on day 6 out of 15 (judging by the achievements), and I still haven’t checked a single document. Not one. Zero bureaucracy. Instead, I’ve met a bunch of odd characters, including two full-on cameos from other games. It’s not subtle either. The immersion breaks instantly. At one point, the main character even asks if someone is just there to break the fourth wall... within the first hour. Which is a weird choice, especially before the game has had a chance to build any real mood.

I ended up checking the Steam forums to see if I was missing something. Turns out you don’t actually start reviewing documents until day 7. So it’s not broken—it’s just unbelievably slow to get going.

I’ve put in 22 hours so far (some of that AFK), and right now it feels like one of the most drawn-out tutorials I’ve ever played. With multiple endings on top of that, I can only imagine how tiring it’ll be to replay.

Tell them RTO is eating an extra two to three hours of your day in commuting, so you no longer have time to come by their shops.

Tell them RTO is costing you all of your discretionary spending. You'll have to tighten your budget, and cook at home from now on.

Tell them RTO is taking away your time to shop around. Sorry local butcher, there simply isn't time to go to multiple shops. We'll just have to get everything in one trip from a big box store.

1mrxo1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mrxo1c/should_you_buy_the_best_ice_cream_maker_ninja/,Should you buy the best ice cream maker Ninja NC301 for treats?,"Using the Ninja NC301 felt like stepping into the future of homemade desserts. This compact wonder transformed my kitchen escapades, proving its worth in delivering a diverse range of treats from creamy gelato to refreshing sorbets. When I first got my hands on it, I couldn’t wait to dive into its capabilities. With two pint containers included, I quickly discovered that this ice cream maker was more than just an appliance—it became a part of our family weekends. Whether I wanted to whip up a keto-friendly dessert or a traditional indulgent ice cream, it handled them all with ease.  

**Compact Design That Saves Space**  
The size of this ice cream maker surprised me. Given its powerful motor and multi-functionality, I expected bulkiness. Instead, the streamlined design, measuring 12.07 inches in length and 6.52 inches in width, made it an easy fit on my counter, even in a smaller kitchen. Not only was it space-efficient, but its sleek silver finish meant it looked modern and stylish sitting out in the open. One memorable moment was when my friend mistook it for a futuristic coffee maker. 

**Impressive Functionalities for All Preferences**  
One key highlight of this product is how flexible it is with recipes. The seven one-touch programs are a game-changer. From ice cream and milkshakes to smoothie bowls, there’s something for everyone. I observed my niece using the sorbet function during her last visit—she was thrilled with how straightforward the process was. Watching her concoction come to life felt like a mix between cooking and magic. The re-spin feature made it even easier to get the exact creaminess we desired, which is especially helpful when kids chime in with their ever-changing preferences.  

**Create Personalized Flavors with Mix-Ins**  
Having grown up with basic store-bought tubs of frozen treats, being able to customize flavors has been a revelation. The mix-in feature is perfect for experimenting. Tossing in crushed Oreos, fresh strawberries, or even bits of dark chocolate gave our desserts that personal touch. My dad, a fan of traditional recipes, surprised us all by adding candied walnuts to his gelato during one family dinner. Such versatility certainly earned the product some brownie points - quite literally when brownies were blended in the mix.  

[Don’t miss Ninja NC301 deals—check Amazon here.](https://triopd.com/p/b08qxb9bh5/)  

**Easy to Clean and Maintain**  
Convenience isn't just about usability—it’s also about how easy it is to clean up after. The dishwasher-safe components like the containers, lids, and paddle meant I spent less time scrubbing and more time enjoying the treats. While manual cleaning is an option, I'm grateful for the appliance's low-maintenance nature. Once, after a chaotic milkshake experiment with the kids, cleanup was unexpectedly quick, even with sticky residue everywhere.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact design, ideal for any kitchen size  
- Multiple one-touch programs catering to various dessert types  
- Easy-to-clean components reduce post-use hassle  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its numerous strengths, a few aspects stood out that could use adjustments:  
- Not compatible with Ninja's other pint series (NC100/200/500), which limits additional accessories.  
- It's a little noise-intensive during processing, though this is somewhat forgivable given the motor's efficiency.  
- The pint capacity might feel restrictive when catering to more than a small group.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to competitors like the Cuisinart ICE-70, the Ninja NC301 excels with its re-spin function and more advanced texture control. However, while the ICE-70 boasts a larger capacity, it doesn't offer the same customization options for mix-ins and varied programs. Similarly, brands like Breville Smart Scoop provide exceptional texture control but come at a significantly higher price point. In terms of versatility and value, Ninja's ice cream maker strikes a commendable balance.  

**Affordable Quality Worth Considering**  
Considering its innovative features, the Ninja NC301 offers great quality for the price. For buyers seeking a reliable, user-friendly appliance designed to deliver fun and creativity without needing high-end expertise, this product checks the right boxes. Compared to premium models, it provides accessible luxury that's perfect for everyday use. I found it particularly satisfying that I could make both indulgent desserts or healthier options all with the same machine. It opens doors for budget-conscious families to explore—and enjoy—desserts like never before.

in this case she wanted to go to a coffee shop to study, i frankly don't like coffee nor do i like studying anywhere outside of my home/the library. she's known this as i said multiple times from now and the past couple months to years that i would not go to one just to study. i even used to work at starbucks and even then it wouldn't of changed my stance on it. (just my personal preference nothing wrong with whoever is into it)

so again, (she's been asking me for the past 2 weeks again) she asked me while i'm taking out the trash to pass it to her, ""when are we going (to the coffee shop)?"" and i responded like i have multiple times, ""i don't want to go but you can go"" and then she instantly starts getting whiny. 

""why? why can't we go together?"" i explained as i usually do, that it's simply not my thing. college classes hasn't even started for me yet, and i don't even have a laptop usuable or portable to be bringing to said shop. 
so after a little back and forth, i just ask ""why can't you take no for an answer? you always do it to me, i don't understand why you can't do the same?""
and her response was ""but we're sisters we should be doing it together?""
and i just got so fed up that i couldn't bring myself to say anything and i just handed her the trash and walked off.

for additional context, when she first brought the idea up (again) maybe 1-3 months ago, she said once she fixes her personal laptop (which is still broken) SHE would go to the coffee shop to work alone, and she said ""you don't have to go because i know you wouldn't like it"" so i'm not sure what the switch-up is??

and now it's been 3 days and shes purposely not making any conversation with me unless she literally has to. it's so annoying to me that each time i make her upset her first reaction is to not speak. usually i'd apologize after the first day, because that's literally the only thing i can do to make her talk, but i can't bring myself to.
it feels so childish and immature and i feel like i'm encouraging it.

we were supposed to go to a painting event that we BOTH wanted to attend yesterday but she decided for us not to go just because she's still mad.

this isn't the first time i've said no to an event or place or outing, and she still insisted i go, (and went just to not make her mad) just for her to turn around and say ""you didn't have to go, you can say no to me, i would of just went by myself"". and i just fell silent and i didn't say anything else.

it's behavior i expect from someone my age or younger, but 28?? seriously? i want to apologize i really do, it's getting so uncomfortable and awkward and i don't have anywhere else to go to spend the night somewhere else. but it's just annoying how i'm always the one apologizing and she just continues to fall back on such petty tatics. i'll give up my pride and apologize but i just really wanted another person's perspective

It truly seems like frequently enough the terms are used interchangeably, but I think there's a key difference. A routine feels like a task: brush your teeth, make coffee, check emails. Rituals, conversely, feel more like a ceremony; they're infused with meaning and intention.

Such as, instead of just ""making coffee,"" a ritual might involve selecting a specific type of bean, mindfully grinding them, using a French press to appreciate the aroma, and then savoring the first sip in a quiet space.It's the *how* and the *why* that seem to shift something from a mere task to a mindful moment.

Does anyone else find this distinction helpful in approaching their daily life? I'm curious to hear how others incorporate ritual into their routines to create a greater sense of fulfillment and chic-ness, whatever that looks like for you! Maybe it's about the specific skincare items you choose and how you layer them, or the way you arrange flowers.What are some small rituals that make a big difference for you?",1,1755356323.0,EverydayChicLife,0,1.0,False

I often really struggle to get consistent shots, requiring excellent puck prep and testing and tuning basically every morning.

I finally found a way to avoid this, a technique I call the: RFB (Rapid Fine Blowout Technique).

The technique is simple and only requires bellows on your grinder. As you grind our beans, rapidly press the bellows to push coffee out way faster. I've been finding that doing this allows me to grind wayyy finer, and get much more consistent shots. 

I believe what's going on is by rapidly blowing the ground beans out, you're majorly reducing clogging and regrinding already properly ground beans, thereby significantly reducing the fine production. That's the only reason I can think of for both the increased consistency and reduced grind size requirement.

I call upon you to test this out and let me know how it goes. I might try installing a high powered fan to blow into the grinder as it grinds if this works. I'm especially interested in the difference this makes in conical vs flat burrs, as I've only tried on a crappy conical.",2,1755356285.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Weekends are the only time when we can spend together without the stress of having to do something the next day. I wanted to have a nice, small date by walking to the coffee shop and enjoying the weather together, but he said he wanted to go to the gym instead. Mind you, it was our first meet-up after 6-7 days. We spent the Friday night watching a movie, but I felt sad that he is not as enthusiastic to spend time together as me. He realised something was off and asked me. I explained that I would like to spend more time with him, etc., but it ended with him going to the gym and me going to the coffee shop alone. It makes me feel like a clingy adn dependent partner, which I try hard not to be.

I also feel like I am a jealous person and need constant reassurance to not get jealous of minor things. I feel like I always need reassurance on minor things that other people would not care to think about (texting with a female classmate, for instance). I can accept that I tend to be more interrogatory about things that involve the opposite sex. I am trying to ask for reassurance without accusation, but I am scared there will be a point where my bf (M25) will not tolerate or be more understanding of these situations, as he usually is the avoidant partner who needs more space. But that space feels like a punishment to me in many cases.

    **TL;DR;** : 
    How can I break these habits of clignyness and assurance before it gets too late?

THIS IS NOT FINANICAL ADVISE. JUST MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS. 

1. Innodata $INOD

What is Innodata? Innodata is a data engineering company that trains Ai. Ever heard of Alexander wangs company ScaleAi that teamed up with META? Or $NBIS’s Toloka? Or Google poaching windsurfs employees? They all do the same thing. Train Ai to learn. Innodata works with META, GOOGLE, APPLE, Xai, and more tech companies. They basically have 0 debt. And  revenues up 79% YoY. Raised guidance last quarter and CEO Jack stated there’s pretty much pipelines in place for growth. Market cap is less than 1.5Billion. With big techs Ai spend and increasing CapEx guidance, I see a booming company in a booming sector. 

2. $BROS Dutch Bros Coffee
A coffee chain that is very popular and growing in America. They are expanding rapidly throughout America, they started on the west coast and are quickly expanding east. Revenue growth of 30% YoY, last quarterly results basically confirmed to me that they can manage the growth while keeping debt under control. What’s even more bullish to me is that same store sales is increasing in a weak consumer spending environment. Starbucks same store sales are down for like the 6th quarter in a row, chipotle missed earnings. But Dutch bros rev is up, same store sales is up. This is super bullish to me. And to my knowledge they haven’t even expanded outside of the U.S. this is also there first FcF positive quarter. 

Would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these companies.

Also would love to hear your opinion on your most bullish companies!

""What's that smell?!"" Mr Clean questioned, absolutely disgusted. Samuel stayed silent, looking in Clean's eyes for exactly 34 minutes and 18 seconds. He finally broke the silence : "".... Mr Clean senpai?! YoUwU noticed me?!"" Mr Clean ignored his stupid question, grabbed a vacuum cleaner and shoved it down Samuel's boxers. Samuel screamed in terror; he was going to keep that pile of excrements in his underpants for dinner! What was he gonna eat now?!

As if reading his mind, Mr Clean spoke up: ""now that this issue is fixed, how about we go out for dinner? You look scrawny and weak."" Samuel was overjoyed. ""Is it a date?!"" He inquired excitedly. 

""I mean.. if you want it to be, it can be, young man"" Mr Clean responded nonchalantly. Was this the start of a successful and passionate relationship? Samuel hoped it was, he certainly wouldn't miss the chance to try dating his dream man.

""How about McDonald's? I have some unresolved issues with them"" Mr Clean spoke, looking slightly irritated for an unknown, hot reason. Samuel ignored the warning behind his words and replied with a confident ""Sure!"" Mr Clean seemed pleased with this answer, and that's all that mattered in Samuel's heart. This was perfection 

They walked towards a McDonald's, hand in hand. Clean's hand felt so strong and crunchy.. once inside the sophisticated establishment, Mr Clean started to argue with the staff about the dirty ice cream machine. Samuel couldn't help but admire his shiny head as it reflected the sunlight through the McDo's windows... he was magnificent, and so toned. Samuel was in awe

""SO DON'T YOU AGREE?!"" .... Huh? Samuel wasn't listening, so he wasn't sure what to respond to his angered future husband. ""Huhhhh... that is a matter of opinion, and mine's the same as yours!"" Samuel exclaimed. Mr Clean gave Samuel a pearly white smile, his cleanly shaved balls bouncing joyfully in his white trousers. ""I knew you'd agree. LETS BURN THIS PLACE DOWN!!!""

At this moment, Samuel realized he fucked up big time. The poor McDonald's staff couldn't escape from Mr Clean's wrath this time, they and their establishment was burnt to the ground into a pile of ashes (that Mr Clean cleaned immediately after the arson)


Timeskip
—————-

Samuel was watching the news, his sweaty feets on the coffee table. He was slurping his now cold tea loudly while scratching a weird pimple he had in his nose, not even bothering to wash his hands afterwards.


""The suspect for the McDonald's incident is said to be bald and very hot"" the tv reporter spoke. Oh no... ""They definitely suspect Mr Clean!"" Samuel thought. Mr Clean was busy washing Samuel's dirty appartement floor. 



Left, right, left and right, Mr Clean's muscular buttcheeks swayed again and again as he mopped the floor. Samuel was captivated by the movements, despite having seen them during the SuperBowl in 2017. He was truly phenomenal....


""Wait, no! I have to do something!"" Samuel exclaimed. Clean's sapphire, moist orbs filled with worry. ""Clean, they're searching for youUUU!!"" Samuel cried, clearly devastated. Mr Clean smiled softly, his gaze softening. ""They will never catch me alive""

Samuel couldn't believe his ears. Was Mr Clean really this naïve? ""Clean, do you even hear yourself?! Only 40% of murders in America goes unresolved! There's a big chance the coppers will get you, 18 people are dead!"" Mr Clean seemed angry hearing that

""Only 60% of murders in America are resolved? WHAT DO MURDERERS DO WITH THE CORPSES?! LEAVE THEM TO ROT?! THAT'S SO UNHYGIENIC!!"" Clean screamed, angrily. Samuel actually started sobbing uncontrollably at that.

Mr Clean's uncanny face twisted in rage, his cleanly shaved balls retracting in anger.. ""You're going to regret your lack of trust in me, Samuel.. I'm leaving FOREVER!!"" Mr clean then ran away, crying. Meanwhile, Samuel just wondered how the fuck Mr Clean knew his name?? He never told him!

After Clean was out of sight, Samuel's emotions finally kicked in. He was never going to see the love of his life again. Samuel was in so much pain that he started bitch crying even louder than before, his sobs waking up every citizens in North America except Jake, Jake Johnson.

Timeskip
—————-

Mr Clean heard and felt guilty, but he needed time to forgive Samuel's stupidity. For now, he left for 𝒫𝒶𝓇𝒾𝓈, 𝐹𝓇𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒. He needed time away from this place, mostly for legal reasons, but also for his personal well-being. Leaving Samuel behind was the wisest course of actions right now.

""Farewell, my friend"" Clean said to no one in particular. A few tears left his magnificent eyes and fell on his pure white shoes. Mr Clean immediately cleaned them and headed towards his destination. He was going to travel there by walking and swimming, because that's how he maintained his exceptional physique outside of cleaning.

Samuel sat down and watched his favourite tv show; My little pony™️. He calmed down, watching his pony waifus having the time of their life... how he wished he was a colourful little pony right now. Samuel fell asleep on the couch and dreamt of ponies, flowers and butterflies.



Mr Clean pov:

Mr Clean just did what he had to do, it was the right decision; so why did it feel so wrong?? He sighed ""I guess I liked him more than I thought.."" Clean roamed in the streets of 𝒫𝒶𝓇𝒾𝓈, seeing a group of 𝓂𝒾𝓂𝑒𝓈 eating 𝒷𝒶𝑔𝓊𝑒𝓉𝓉𝑒𝓈 with 𝒩𝓊𝓉𝑒𝓁𝓁𝒶 on them.

Suddenly, a man wearing a 𝒷𝑒𝓇𝑒𝓉 and carrying a 𝒷𝒶𝑔𝓊𝑒𝓉𝓉𝑒 ran towards Clean. ""GIB MOI ALL OF YOUREUH MONY ORE YOUREUH DEAD!"" The man screamed, pointing his 𝒷𝒶𝑔𝓊𝑒𝓉𝓉𝑒 towards Clean's throat. Mr Clean snapped him in half like a 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝓃𝒸𝒽 𝒻𝓇𝒾𝑒, unhinged his jaw and ate his corpse, bones included (because leaving him to rot would be unhygienic).

The police tried to apprehend him, but Mr Clean got a Mr. Clean Multi-Purpose Cleaner, Summer Citrus, 3.78 L out and splashed them with it; the product eliminated 99.9% of all germs, which constituted 99.9% of the policemen's bodies. They died instantly. Mr Clean cleaned the remaining 0.01% before heading towards 𝓁𝒶 𝒯o𝓊𝓇 𝐸𝒾𝒻𝒻𝑒𝓁.

Then he started singing « 𝐿𝒶 𝓋𝒾𝑒 𝑒𝓃 𝓇o𝓈𝑒 »

He then awkwardly stood there for like 17 minutes and passed out from exhaustion (he swam from America to Europe, give him a break). He dreamt of Samuel and various cleaning products.. He also had a nightmare involving the dirty McDonald's ice cream machine.

Samuel's pov:

Samuel was still watching the news, so he immediately learned about 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝓃𝒸𝒽 police officers being killed with Mr. Clean Multi-Purpose Cleaner, Summer Citrus, 3.78 L. He knew it; his love was in 𝐹𝓇𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒! He immediately Naruto-ran over to the airport. Samuel was going to meet his love in 𝐹𝓇𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒!

Mr Clean woke up from his slumber, his shiny, bald head glistening under the sunrise. Was it morning already? He slept for like 11 hours! Mr Clean decided to get up and head towards a restaurant, he was hungry as fuck, which was odd, considering he ate a whole human being yesterday. Speaking of which, he'd never do that here again; 𝒻𝓇𝑒𝓃𝒸𝒽 𝓅𝑒𝑜𝓅𝓁𝑒 were definitely not Mr Clean's favourite meal!

"" M-Mr Clean??"" A shaky voice spoke from behind him. Clean turned around and gasped when he saw- ""SAMUEL?!?!"" They then ran towards each other in slow motion, hugging tightly once they reached one another. Then they started singing « 𝐿𝒶 𝓋𝒾𝑒 𝑒𝓃 𝓇o𝓈𝑒 » by Edith Piaf, it being the second time for Mr Clean. ""𝔇𝔢𝔰 𝔶𝔢𝔲𝔵 𝔮𝔲𝔦 𝔣𝔬𝔫𝔱 𝔟𝔞𝔦𝔰𝔰𝔢𝔯 𝔩𝔢𝔰 𝔪𝔦𝔢𝔫𝔰, 𝔘𝔫 𝔯𝔦𝔯𝔢 𝔮𝔲𝔦 𝔰𝔢 𝔭𝔢-

Luckily for everyone, I have no intention to write those lyrics all over again. 



They cried happy tears of joy as they reached the end of the song. Mr Clean started carrying Samuel bridal style, slowly walking towards North America. It took 18 months, but every seconds was worth it for the couple. Couple? Was that what they were?

""Mr Clean... what are we?"" Samuel asked fearfully. Mr Clean seemed to ponder on it for a few days, but ended up carefully replying; ""I'm a magical cleaning deity, and you're an homo, homo sapient""  Samuel was not satisfied with this response. 

""Wait no, I meant our relationship, what are we?"" Samuel asked again, with tears in his eyes this time. Mr Clean pondered on it for a few more days before saying ""I'm your bald future husband!"" Samuel's worried tears immediately turned to happy tears. He then awkwardly said : ""You're my future 👨🏻‍🦲👰🏻‍♂️🫃🏻™️""

Mr Clean was confused as to why Samuel listed emojis and added a trademark at the end, but he was happy nonetheless. His dream life was up ahead, with Samuel. Suddenly, his left asscheek exploded emotionally, but exceptionally, Clean didn't mind. Washing the blood in his pants could wait this one time.

Then he died from an hemorrhage.",14,1755355827.0,copypasta,9,1.0,False

So I am torn between staying at the Hilton Marina so we can be near the water taxi or staying on the beach.   I would like a hotel where we can walk to different restaurants for dinner and maybe a coffee shop we can also walk to.  We also wanted to do the water taxi one day so we can see other areas.

We will just Uber to the cruise port so I am not concerned about free shuttles and all of that.

My first question is do I need to inject the Wegovy into a fatty area?  Could I inject it into my upper leg, the sides near my butt?  Do I have to pinch the fatty skin to bring it up for the injection?  For my first injection, I just pushed down hard in a soft area until I heard the first click then the second click.

My second question is should I expect my appetite to decrease?  I did notice I’m not very hungry, just been eating some chicken, crackers, Gatorade and coffee!  I need to stock up on veggies, I know.  Any tips on what to eat would be greatly appreciated!

i sipped it and i thought it tasted like abject poison. after 2 sips i felt shivers going up my spine and tingling on my cheeks. i started feeling cold, which encouraged me to drink the hot coffee more attentively. 

after finishing it (which was quickly) i felt totally normal, just like i felt before drinking it. so then what are my thoughts? i don't regret having that cup, but i now see more clearly that i never truly enjoyed the taste of coffee (it was an illusion all along). so, from now on i won't have another one. the illusion of enjoyment has been totally shattered for me. not only do i not enjoy the taste, but it doesn't even warm me, but makes me feel cold.

In any case, let me share my story.

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you're a fellow lover of specialty coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? You either get guys who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly ones so I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic

- I'm an INTJ-T Arch, Aries, if you’re into MBTI and believes in that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history, finance and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People
Castaway | Nirvana  | Cebu | Muay Thai | Meditation s by Marcus Aurelius
Forrest Gump | Ebe Dancel | Japan | Scuba/Freediving | Start with Why by Simon Sinek
Homeland | Urbandub | Rome | Piano | Atomic Habits by James Clear
Before Sunset | Frederic Chopin | Canada | Running | How to think like a Roman Emperor
The Office | Eminem | New York | Cooking | Letters from Stoic
Big Bang Theory | John Mayer | Maldives | Film & Photography | 48 Laws of Power
Breaking Bad | Elton John | Marrakesh | Badminton | The Intelligent Investor

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- High standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge too. Love and isn't afraid to try new things

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine!

**Edit**

Note: I’m reposting this since I haven’t found the right person yet. This will be my last attempt—if it doesn’t work out, maybe online dating just isn’t for me. Still, I’ve met some good people along the way: some weren’t ready for anything serious, and with others, the connection just didn’t click. I’d like to reiterate that I’m looking for someone who’s physically active, not obese, and who doesn’t do drugs or have tattoos.

1. Innodata $INOD

What is Innodata? Innodata is a data engineering company that trains Ai. Ever heard of Alexander wangs company ScaleAi that teamed up with META? Or $NBIS’s Toloka? Or Google poaching windsurfs employees? They all do the same thing. Train Ai to learn. Innodata works with META, GOOGLE, APPLE, Xai, and more tech companies. They basically have 0 debt. And free revenues up 79% YoY. Raised guidance last quarter and CEO Jack stated there’s pretty much pipelines in place for growth. Market cap is less than 1.5Billion. With big techs Ai spend and increasing CapEx guidance, I see a booming company in a booming sector. 

2. Dutch Bros Coffee BROS
A coffee chain that is very popular and growing in America. They are expanding rapidly throughout America, they started on the west coast and are quickly expanding east. Revenue growth of 30% YoY, last quarterly results basically confirmed to me that they can manage the growth while keeping debt under control. What’s even more bullish to me is that same store sales is increasing in a weak consumer spending environment. Starbucks same store sales are down for like the 6th quarter in a row, chipotle missed earnings. But Dutch bros rev is up, same store sales is up. This is super bullish to me. And to my knowledge they haven’t even expanded outside of the U.S. 

Would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on these companies.

Also would love to hear your opinion on your most bullish companies!

1mrx2t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1mrx2t7/aiden_clean_debris_from_flow_meter/,Aiden - clean debris from flow meter,"Ok, got Aiden cheaply because of ""Add Water"" nemesis... Descaled and it was fine for a few days, flush reported \~6ml/s. Started loving the coffee, but ""Add Water"" returned; real flow went to ca 1.5ml/s (2.5 cups for full flush cycle) and reported flow when doing flush was between 0 and 0.5ml/s.

After disassembly, it turned out that the root cause is flow meter at the very beginning of the water line. There is no sieve before the flow meter, any grain of coffee can get directly to it... and it is *tiny* inside (cross-section definitely less than 1mm squared). I think any grain of coffee bigger than espresso size will clog it and not flow through.

Usual warnings: I'm not responsible, by opening Aiden you're voiding warranty and you're working near live electricity. You should know what that means and/or have electrician certification, if you don't you really should not attempt this.

Since I don't have warranty, I had nothing to lose. Start by removing feet and five torx screws at the bottom:

https://preview.redd.it/85rkut016ejf1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=03979926ec6ff5d76b216c345704210785859c19

Next, remove three screws holding the water line and remove waterline cover. You need to unclip clips next to two upper screws, but even then it takes quite a bit of force. Be careful :-)

Flip Aiden around, and you should see the water inlet in it's full glory (red) with flow meter right next to it (green):

Unclip the flow meter, and disconnect it from pipes. You'll most likely need a needle to clean it, but be careful - there is one black object that needs to stay - the wheel with magnet that is the actual flow meter, right under a tiny arrow. You can blow through it in reverse, I did and it helped... but you can damage it by doing that (in the same way as vacuuming a fan will kill it).

Here it is cleaned:

Reassemble (edit: Make sure you put it back in the same direction, the arrow needs to point in the direction of water flow) and you should be back to at least 5ml/s. I ended up with \~5.5ml/s - not as good as new, but good enough.

It would be great if someone (ideally directly from Fellow) could identify the flow meter part number - it looks very inexpensive and could save a ton of Aidens from ladfill.",7,1755355074.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False
1mrx2i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1mrx2i9/they_say_they_love_you_but_ive_never_truly/,They say they love you but I've never truly believed it,"Since I was a small child. Since I can remember, I've felt unloved.

I've not felt safe. I've not felt wanted, heard, understood, accepted.

There was nothing obviously wrong with my parents. They provided, gave me shelter, were nice to all my friends and even took me to my after school activities, watched my concerts.

So I've always felt an imposter syndrome, or very confused about being an estranged adult child... and enormously guilty. Because from the outside, people would think they are good parents. And everyone else seems to have it worse. Like clear defined broken boundaries. Or traumatic events that are definitively unforgivable.

A part of me wishes it was so clearly defined. So I could stop torturing myself about it.

They've said they love me over the years. But I've never believed it. Why is that the case? 

They've never called me to say hello. I had a mobile phone at age 22 and not once did they call me or text me just to hear my voice and talk. I'm 41 now. It was only a message to tell me that a letter arrived, or about someone's upcoming birthday. Never just because.

As a child, they never comforted me after a death, or as a young adult at home they never comforted me after a break up. They hardly spoke at all. The next day was always as if nothing happened and nobody checked on me.

Nobody really spoke to me as a child. Nobody asked me questions. Nobody read books or sang songs to me. As an adult, they never asked me to go anywhere with them. Only if it was a family thing like a dinner or a movie all 4 of us (my sister and I and parents). But nobody ever asked me individually to go for a walk, to go for coffee. Nobody would sit down and ask me something at home. It was the same every day... them walking around the home, while I sat there hoping to get some attention.. then they take a plate for dinner to the TV and silently watch and then going to bed.

There were times where I would have silly ideas and I would say something excited like ""I really want to have my own jewellery business one day, and I think this is the name and the style I'm going for!"" They would turn their head away from the TV, look blankly and cough, then turn back to the TV silently with no comment. Ignoring what I said. A regular thing. 

After highschool, I was very good at music, so I wanted to go to college to study music. My mother laughed at me ""what do you want to go and do that for?"" Laughing so hard she had to hold the wall and her belly. I wanted to do it because it made me happy, music was my identity. That prevented me from practicing at home and my shyness and low self esteem stopped me from progressing and improving in my music. I eventually gave up.

They did not teach me anything. I tried to ask about politics and superannuation and life skills. The discussion was always disinterested and then rushing off to do some menial tasks. I grew up very very sheltered, and as a teen I often had comments from friends and people that I was boring or not knowledgeable. I had comments from people who thought I was autistic because I didn't know how to socialise. It still affects me now.

There were days where my father never said hello or goodbye. He would walk in from work and walk right past me as I sat on the sofa, ready to say hello to him. He wouldn't. It would go on for months on and off, no hello or goodbye. No words at all. Like I was a ghost, invisible, living there with them. I spent a lot of time in my room because of this.

My mother never told me she was proud of me. They never spoke highly of me or my achievements or me in general. Just never spoke really. They spoke to eachother and I was always an object in the background. In the car they would speak to eachother as if I was not there. I was excluded from conversation as I sat in the back. As a teen it was the same. If I sat in the front next to one of them they wouldn't know what to say. And neither would I. But I was the child and the teen and I needed socialisation. I needed role models and guidance.

I needed someone to care about me and show it. When I really think about it... It was worse than it might seem. They let me wet the bed every night until I was age 14 before they thought to get help for me. I was the teen at school who wet the bed. I was already getting bullied for my lack of social skills too.

They knew I was obsessed with music but never asked me who I like to listen to. They never asked me what I want to do as a career. They never asked anything.

They say they love me. But they didn't make an effort to get to know me. So how do I believe they love me?

The estrangement... It's been 6 years since I've seen them, and 4 years since we spoke or text at all. I've changed my phone number. They're getting old now. My dad had a stroke nd recovered. Their time is limited and I feel such a sense of loss already. I always have.

I feel a gaping hole in my heart. I know it's never going to be filled. I never got the love a child needs.

I was a child always hoping that somebody would notice me there and truly want to spend time with me.

I've been left with a dissociative disorder called Depersonalisation. It's because I never learned healthy coping skills for life. And because I've had to do everything alone without support.

I tried to tell my parents about the disorder... It's a vulnerable thing to talk about. But they rolled their eyes many times. They've dismissed it every time I tried to get help and support from them. They act like I'm making it up. I'm irresponsible. They act annoyed that I can't get myself on my feet in life still at my age.

But I have Depersonalisation Disorder. It's not easy to live with it 24/7 for over 20 years. I'm essentially disabled as I can't cope with much and I can't manage to care for myself properly. I can't work full time. I can't keep my space clean. I can barely feed myself. My sister is the exact same but even worse than me. Explain that.

How can two children grow up to be so poorly functioning in life. How does ones childhood do that to them? 

I never got the help I needed and now it's been so long that I fear I'm stuck with this disorder forever. With a gaping hole in my heart from a lack of love.  Always longing and waiting and hoping for something that will never be there.

BUT WAIT. After doing a little more digging (and okay, getting a little desperate for side hustle cash), I discovered something legit. There are REAL apps out here, in 2025, that PAY you money—like, MONEY, money—to test new features!!! 😳

I still can’t believe I slept on this all this time. Some of these paid me enough for my Wifi, coffee, AND Netflix. You won’t believe these top 7 I found—links and all.

**1. GoodNovel TestLab**

- You get paid to read new chapters AND test their interface improvements.
- They email updates weekly—sometimes I get access to features before they hit the app store.
- Here’s the kicker: honest feedback = bigger bonuses. How was this kept secret?!
- Wanna see? Try it here **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** – LIKE REALLY PRESS THAT LINK – it actually works.  
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (YOU’RE WELCOME)

**2. BetaBound**

- Sent me three new apps to test just this month. I was literally sitting in bed, making money.
- Direct PayPal payouts!
- UI testing = easy side hustle goals.

**3. UserTesting**

- This one is insane. Companies pay you to record your screen AND your reactions.
- The more detailed you are, the, uh, richer you get.  
- Some tests pay $25+ for just 15 minutes!

**4. PlayTestCloud**

- Gamers, REJOICE. You play-test mobile games before anyone else.
- You’re basically getting paid to do what you already love. 
- Plus – zero commitment. Try a test, skip a test, whatever.

**5. Toluna Influencers**

- They partner with big flipping brands—testing isn’t just apps, it’s all sorts of crazy features.  
- Payouts in cash or vouchers.
- Surveys & testing combined, side hustle on easy mode.

**6. Userlytics**

- Get this: companies like Google, Amazon, and Dell are desperate for feedback.
- Try their products, GET PAID.
- Oh, and did I mention these are international? Bye bye, geo-restrictions.

**7. GoodNovel (Again Because It Is Wildly Underrated)**

- Y’all, creators LITERALLY sneak-preview scripts and design fixes before the beta even drops to regulars.
- Here’s that sign-up again: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Don’t snooze like I did. They’re paying people NOW. Legit good for easy cash.   
- Once more, in case you missed it: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Look, is this gonna make you a millionaire? Obviously not.  
But paying for Starbucks every week by doing easy, fun, and sometimes WEIRD app tests on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**? Game. Changed.

If you’ve ever used any of these, did you have a “Wait, this is LEGIT?!” moment like I did? Let’s discuss. Drop your secret app side hustles or comment if you’ve actually cashed out.

I used a crosscut blade that had been sharpened a month ago, so it had been used probably 5 times since then. No earthquakes, orgasms, too much coffee, or anything else that could have shaken the sled happened during the cuts. 

I'm puzzled. Does OO just burn on cuts? When I sand the endgrain on a belt sander (a previous cutting board), I had to take very, very thin passes to keep the sandpaper (120 grit) from leaving burn marks, and I used rubber stick to clean off the sandpaper after (almost) every pass.

Aven Advisor is a new app that promises to help to track your financial situation. Kind of like the old Mint app, you have to give them your personal info and link up bank accounts/credit cards, and then they offer a unique mix of things:

Free weekly credit score (VantageScore 4.0 for me, even though some screenshots show FICO).
Find your hidden subscriptions by mining your transactions.
Track your home value, neighborhood home prices, and show you nearby house listings.
Get a free lien report on your property.
Track your bank balances, brokerage balances, and credit card debt.
Track the value of your car.
Shows you nearby Facebook Marketplace listing for cars and other random things.

So why give them your data? Well, if you are a homeowner with a good credit (700+), they will give you $5 in Starbucks credit once every week. You have to manually open the app and tap the link on every Monday (so they know you’re actively using it), but I’ve successfully gotten my credit and was able to link the gift card to my Starbucks app.

Join at Aven.com/advisor (remember, only homeowners get the Starbucks offer). 

You can also get an additional one-time $5 cash bonus with my referral code AS25HJJFUC.

I'm 28(M), and honestly… I'm just having a really hard time making and keeping friends. Naa bay pareho nako ani? Normal raba ni? Or ako ra jud?

Growing up, I’ve always been the kind of person nga medyo reserved. Dili man ko antisocial, I enjoy talking to people.. especially deep, meaningful conversations. I’m the kind of person nga if you sit down with me, I can talk about life, emotions, purpose, even random stuff like music, growth, or why people are the way they are. I’m emotionally aware, grounded, and I’d like to think I have a good head on my shoulders.

In short, I got my shit together. I work, I go to the gym 5 times a week, I eat right, I read, I reflect. I try to be a better person every day. Pero despite all that… I feel like I’m always left out socially.

Ang mga tao nga akong kaila, naa silay kaugalingong barkada, kaugalingong lingin. When I try to reach out or invite them, murag di kaayo sila interesado. If mo-chat ko, murag dry ra kaayo ilang reply. It’s like I’m always the one putting in the effort, and people don’t really reciprocate.

Di man ko demanding nga type sa friend. I don’t expect constant communication or hangouts every week. I just want those genuine connections. Katong mga tao nga mo-reach out pud nimo not just because they need something, but because they genuinely want to check on you or spend time with you. I miss that.

Usahay mag-hunahuna ko nga maybe I'm too “different.” Maybe people my age are just too busy or settled na. Or maybe naa juy something sa akong vibe nga di kaayo approachable? Pero daghan man pud niingon nga I’m friendly, kind, humble, and chill ra nga tawo. So murag conflicting kaayo.

Karon nga 28 na ko, I look around and I see people going on trips together, celebrating birthdays with big groups, going out for drinks or coffee, or just having someone to call when they’re feeling low. And me? I just deal with things on my own most of the time. Maglakaw ra kog mall alone, mag-gym, magkaon sa gawas, usahay maghuna-huna “unsa kaha feeling naay taw motext nimo out of nowhere nga, ‘Hey, laag ta.’” Or even just a simple “Kumusta ka?” nga walay lain rason, but because they care.

I know I’m not alone, pero in this world full of people, nganong lisod man jud makig connect? Basin tungod sa social media culture? Basin tungod kay daghan na kaayo distractions? Or maybe wala lang jud ko sa saktong lugar nga makakita ug like-minded people?

To anyone out there feeling the same.. if you’re reading this I just want to say, I feel you. It sucks. But maybe someday, things will change for us.

And if naa mo diha nga parehas ug huna-huna or open makig amigo haha basin we can be friends. Sometimes, all it takes is a simple “Hi.”

1mrwylv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmyLynnBradley/comments/1mrwylv/my_theory_on_the_amy_bradley_story/,My theory on the Amy Bradley story,"This is just my take in response to those who claim she fell over board or jumped from the ship, because i truthfully cant understand how some people can come to that conclusion.

How do you explain the images of her that were emailed to her family? She clearly looks different and has aged appropriately, but it looks exactly like her. Professionals reviewed the images in depth and concluded it has to be her. 

Im no genius, but i knew as soon as i seen the images that it was her, its hard to refute. 

I dont think she jumped overboard, i think its ridiculous to assert it in my opinion, no hate to you but i cant possibly believe that to be the case. She would have been found, even remnants. I mean looking at the timeframe and ship location had she jumped, i do believe she herself would have either made it to the island the ship was heading to, dead or alive, and if it were a case of “sharks”, they dont eat the body completely. When have you ever seen someone consumed entirely in one bite by a shark? 

I cant think of a time where that happened. Are you telling me not even a finger or a limb washed up onto shore or an article of clothing? I dont think that’s believable at all.

Personally, i believe there is weight to the sightings of her. You have all these random individuals with nothing to gain from their statements, who didnt know who she was until after the fact, who then brought it forward. I truthfully believe after learning of who she is, they reported it as quickly and accurately as they could.

Obviously, i dont agree with the ex-navy seal having kept it to himself, personally, id say fuck my pension over the life of some stranded captive girl.  I understand his POV, but i dont necessarily agree with his choices and wouldnt have done the same. Thats all ill say on that, but i dont believe he is lying.

I mean, it cannot be a coincidence. 

On the other hand, if you have people trafficking girls in a country or city/town like barbados and surrounding areas, you need to consider the hold that criminal organisations have on the rest of the population/citizens. 

If they can so openly keep and hold women captive, dont you think that provokes fear in the remaining citizens? The police officer from the documentary had spoken to the matter of her likliness of washing up ashore, and i believe his statement. I also believe and understand his statement regarding the nature of crime in the area.

We forget that they abide by massively different laws in these countries, it isnt america, were dealing with an entirely different atmosphere. 

Lets not pretend we dont understand the severity of these trafficking organisations. They are lawless, and are without any moral compass.

This isnt an attack, but i find it a bit jarring that people are still saying that she jumped or fell overboard. 

The IP address matter enhances the theory she is alive. Why would someone continue to look at the amybradleyismissing.com website, for lengthy periods of time, on particular holidays. What possible reason or connection would a random citizen of barbados have with her site, or any herself. 

Of course i dont know everything, im not in the FBI, am i. But i think theres things here that although cannot result in a definite outcome, they cant be refuted either.

I personally believe “yellow” had involvement in this. Potentially actively. 

You have a stranger who knows nothing about amy or yellow, 100% identify amy and yellow on the beach in an awkward encounter. AFTER she had already been missing for a period of time, and left the ship. He was with her after the fact. After the announcement on the ship, after the pandemonium.

He had collected and taken home a suitcase of images of loads of female passengers. My theory? Potential trafficking victims. Amy unfortunately was the main target in this case.

We dont know the conversation that went on between her and yellow, for all we know, he could have propositioned her to go to the vacant closed nightclub area late in the morning, it could have been for anything. The idea that it was strictly sex is a bit clumsy in my opinion. 

He may have offered her some party drug, weed, or coke, or an after party. We dont know, but it doesnt automatically mean she went with him to have sex. She was obviously a lesbian, regardless of what he wanted, im sure she made it known OR rejected sexual advances if any. 

I do suspect, in my opinion, he started working on cruises for this purpose, or at least with the idea in mind that he had access to a large number of women, especially white women. This isnt a claim to ingrained racism, but he clearly had an affinity for white women given his collection of images he had taken home with him. Im not saying he successfully done it to anyone else but Amy, but i do think theres an element of truth in the possibility that he seen the cruise as an OPPORTUNITY to involve himself in some way, to the female passengers.  It was stated he was an open flirt with many women, that in itself isnt a crime, but it does show the nature of who he was. 

Amy was described as magnetic, all eyes were on her, for her energy, and aura. People do all kinds of crazy things to women for just being, especially ones that stand out like she did. 

I believe amy may still be alive, though that is wavering as the years pass rapidly. I do believe she was alive, and the encounters were truthful.

Just because they went about it in a different way to what you may have, doesnt make them false. 

You forget these people who witnessed her are in an unknown territory, where criminals wear guns to their hips, and have no problem making you disappear. If you thought the threat to your life was imminent, what would you do? Im sure youd want to go home to your own family.

Its incredibly common for people to turn a blind eye to their own benefit.

I couldnt have done nothing personally, my conscience wouldnt have let me, but ive never been in that situation, you dont really know what youll do till youre faced with the situation.

I dont know, this is my theory. 

I just think some people in this thread are maybe too quick to try and resolve it down to a simple thing. Take into consideration how fucking horrific and twisted and sick the world is, especially in countries that arent as “lawful” or straight edge as places like Europe or America (america is its own conversation but for the point im making, they have at least a judicial system and you cant really get away with much without consequences) etc etc where you cant really get away with much for long. There is an outcome to your actions. 

Why do you think people go to these far out countries to commit crimes, like pedophiles who hurt kids in countries like thailand and indonesia? Off topic but you understand my point.

I think it may be slightly insulting to state she fell overboard or jumped, my gut and heart tell me she was alive, and forced somehow someway into being trafficked, and over the years, she acclimated to the circumstances, and stopped trying. I mean, if it were you, 27+ years on, in her shoes, im sure at some point youre gonna feel hopeless.

Whos to say she wasnt being monitored and only got to do certain things, in certain time periods? Whos to say it isnt someone controlling what she does or looks at, what if her captor is showing her the website, in a controlled environment, under supervision? 

What if her captor had been the father of a potential child following rape/impregnation?

For all we can assume, she has likely been tortured sexually and mentally and physically for nearly 3 decades. 

All i can think is how fucking awful her life must have been following her boarding that ship. We dare not even imagine the depravity she likely has faced. It turns my stomach and makes me ill. 

We live in a sick fucking world where people will pay insane money just to witness someone being brutalised, never mind actually doing the brutalising. There is unfortunately a market and money to be made on the suffering of women and young people/kids. 

Lets not be ignorant to the very real possibilities here. It just comes across dense to me. 

Youve got a 6 foot FBI agent who scowered her room on the ship, TELLING you that even the barrier on the balcony was chest high on him. She was only 5’6. And what? She willingly chose to climb onto a glass coffee table and swing herself overboard during the night for no reason, u provoked? 

No person willing to kill themselves would do so in the circumstances or situation she was in. Why would she do that in an ajoining area to where her family were sleeping? She deeply loved her family, im not dismissing the potential she may have experienced depression or suicidality in her life, but i seriously doubt she would have ever willingly put that level or pain or burden on her family, especially in the next fucking room/area. 

She had just gotten a dog, an apartment, a job, a car. From personal experience and understanding from surrounding friends and family, people dont typically go out of their way to create a new burden on themselves if they plan on taking an exit from life. She had made plans with people after the cruise, she was in love with someone she hoped to reconnect with. This doesnt scream someone who wanted to die. Especially while on a family cruise?

It’s nonsensical to me. And how could she have “fallen” overboard? The fucking barrier was probably up to her eyebrows. Not something you just fall over accidentally if the height of the barrier conflicts with your own height. And what, no one heard her “fall” or scream? Any commotion? The table or chair she stood on didnt make a noise or slant across the floor as she fell over? 

Come on. 

Surely i cant be the only one with this assumption? If so, im sincerely concerned for the people spouting their theories on here. Im not attacking you, but i dont buy it. ",0,1755354815.0,AmyLynnBradley,37,0.47,False
1mrwxql,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrwxql,Northwestern - Prentice breakfast omelette,"First time eating here at Prentice— it’s a little hidden but thought we would check it out. Located in the Northwestern Hospital campus in Streeterville, you call from your room phone and within 30-45 minutes they bring the food right to your room. Phone operators not the most pleasant, delivery folks much more pleasant. Nice views from where we ate, almost a “Rear Window” type vibe on the 22nd floor. 

I was able to customize the omelette and specify egg whites too which was nice. Not too greasy, and I picked some favorite veggies to add in. 7/10. The bacon was a little rubbery but after 1.5 hours of sleep I would have eaten a bag of sand, so I didn’t care. 5/10. Drank a lot of apple juice out of the limited drink options and they had the cups like the school cafeteria which was, I guess, nostalgic, maybe. 6/10.

The menu leans healthier for all options which was nice, I think it’s important to have health conscious meals from time to time. It arrived on a hot plate with a cover that truly kept it warm for two hours after it was delivered which was impressive, 10/10. Not pictured is a bowl of oatmeal. We also got two of the “Fantastic Salads” for lunch and while not what I would describe as “fantastic” they certainly hit the spot and didn’t make me shit my brains out, which I appreciated. 

The patient gets the meal for free and the partner tray is $12 and that comes with entree and apps and juice or coffee for both people. And by free I mean $20K~? but insurance is still being sorted out so we will see what the final bill is. 

Huge plus is that there is no 3% service fee or gratuity needed at all for that matter. It sounds like it is baked into the $20K.",73,1755354764.0,chicagofood,14,0.97,False

1mrwpyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1mrwpyo/price_of_everything/,Price of everything,"I’ve just returned from a reasonably long trip across mainland Europe, and while it’s always a pleasure to come home to Ireland, I couldn’t help but reflect on how different the quality of life feels when you compare the day-to-day cost of living. Having previously lived in France, I was already aware of these differences, but now they seem even more pronounced.


In much of continental Europe, the essentials of daily life are simply more affordable without any apparent sacrifice in quality. For example, air conditioning is a standard feature across cafés, restaurants, hotels, and transport networks, yet this doesn’t translate into inflated consumer prices. Coffee in Italy or France typically costs around €2, while in Dublin, the average is closer to €4–€4.50, with many cafés charging even more. Similarly, bottled water in Paris or Milan can often be found for €1, whereas in Ireland it is regularly two to three times that. (Eg. I paid €4.90 for a large coffee and a pastry in the south of France in 2024) 


Ironically, the quality of coffee abroad often seems superior despite the lower cost.


Alcohol follows the same trend. A glass of good-quality wine in France, Spain, or Italy can cost between €5–€10, with premium selections priced slightly higher. By comparison, equivalent offerings in Ireland carry a noticeably higher baseline.


Businesses in Ireland often try to justify these prices by pointing to rising costs such as energy, rent, wages, and supply chain pressures. While these are valid considerations, they don’t fully explain the gap. In fact, Ireland’s experience reflects a classic case of “cost-push inflation” interacting with “demand-pull inflation.” Yes, input costs such as rent and energy have risen, but places have also raised prices because the market tolerates it. Put simply, consumers are willing (or forced) to pay. This creates a cycle: once some businesses increase their prices, others follow suit, citing “higher costs,” even when economies of scale or efficiencies abroad show these hikes aren’t inevitable.


Meanwhile, multinational energy firms operating in Ireland have reported record-breaking profits in recent years. This underlines another economic reality: price inelasticity of demand. Essential goods and services such as energy, water, coffee, even specific types of foods can bear higher prices because consumers have little choice but to pay, despite alternatives being cheaper abroad.


Ireland, by contrast, has a relatively small and concentrated market where businesses often move in lockstep, reinforcing price hikes.


Being abroad was, in many ways, a breath of fresh air. Of course, living in a country and holidaying there are two very different things, but having experienced both, I can say with confidence that the affordability and accessibility of everyday life in mainland Europe far outstrips what we see at home.


If the opportunity arose, I would gladly consider living abroad again full time - and for those wondering why so many people are leaving Ireland to work and live elsewhere hopefully this has been a well explained example. ",51,1755354286.0,ireland,104,0.73,False

Even if her parents don't give her money as an adult, she's still a very privileged white woman with parents who are wealthy. And why is she so obsessed with her body and appearance to the point of talking about it extensively in a pointless video that no one asked for? She must be really bothered.

[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/117wwr/my_dad_abandoned_me_when_i_was_2_and_now_wants_to/)

My mom overdosed when I was four. I was used to her passing out for periods of time, so I just made toast and watched cartoons at first. But on the third day I got bored and went to play at the playground. Someone became concerned and next thing you know they're taking her away and I'm going to stay with ""some nice people.""

Well, none of this people were very nice. I could go in details, but lets just say that I was removed from the first few due to abuse. And by the time I was put in a decent home I wasn't a nice little kid people wanted to adopt anymore. I was ""too old"" and an asshole who hated them because I knew- in little kid logic- that even though they had red bunk beds and gave me ice cream after dinner, that soon they would be like the rest.

I eventually ran away when I was sixteen, my foster dad got mad at me for going in the fridge without asking and next thing I know I'm packing my bags because I figured someone would pay me to do shitty work and wouldn't treat me like trash.

I'm 24 now and my dad friended me on fb. We have the same name and he sent me a long message about how he's gotten older now and thinks I should meet my siblings, etc.

... I hate him. Maybe I shouldn't. But he left me with a heroin addict and went on about his life. He has a family now? Well, cool. I never had one. Not until I grew up and started my own.

I honestly think that letting him know I don't want to be his buddy or his son or whatever he thinks he needs would make me feel better. I could stop hating him and resenting him, unload it on him and just move on. I also want to let him now that I lived in an apartment with my dead mom for three days and we didn't have anyone who cared about us enough to come by. I want to show him the burns I have on my arm. I want to let him know that I hid from one of my foster dads every night under my bed and prayed to a god I no longer believe in that he would just leave me alone. I want him to know that I never had real birthdays or christmases. That I wasn't allowed to go in the fridge in most of these places and in extreme cases I wasn't even allowed to leave my room unsupervised.

Would this be petty and horrible? Should I just ignore him?

**MORE RELEVENCE ON HIS LIFE FROM COMMENTS**

**Did your dad know about your mom's death?**

*He did know my mom died because they contacted him and his relatives to try and place me. They weren't interested. My mom didn't have anybody.*

*They called him to see if he had any interest when my mom died. He didn't. And neither did any of his family. He then signed away any rights he had. And what did my mom do? Yeah, she od'd. But she tried. She fed and clothed me and loved me. She was addicted to a drug and it was a horrible thing, but she loved her son. He walked away and 22 years later decided to see how life treated me.*

**About child support & custody**

*I was four. For two years she did it on her own. He never called or checked on me. Or sent a dime. After living in seven fake-families, I can tell you that not one treated me as good as she did. She was screwed up but she tried. He didn't have the balls to try. Do you have kids? I have two. I've never spent more than a weekend away from them. And I can tell you, that I would die for them. I would work 80 hour weeks if that's what it took to support them. I would do anything for them. But I would never just walk away and not look back for two decades.*

*She didn't -get- full custody. She got left with it, there wasn't a divorce or custody battle. Technically that was criminal. Maybe his life is better. But apparently it bothers him enough to write me a sappy message and ask to meet me. But, the cost of him walking away is he'll never be my dad and I'll never grab the cup of coffee. A parents job is to make their life support a child. And I have no respect for anyone who doesn't even try. Even people in prison write letter to their kids.*

**About foster time**

*I know there are good places. I stayed in contact with my social worker and she cried when we met up once and said that I was her worst case, because I was such a sweet adoptable little boy and I got the worst of the lot. And by the time she found a good placement I was too scared for it to be a good place.*

[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/118ecb/updatemy_dad_abandoned_me_when_i_was_2_and_now/) - *After a few hours same day*

I wrote a message, is this okay to send? I decided I don't want to come off as bitter or angry. But I don't want him to still have hope of some kind of hallmark movie ending either.

>Dear Jack,

>I am 24 years old. I am not the little boy who cried when you left. I am a man, with a son and daughter of my own. I've never spent more than a weekend away from them. I am a father and a damned good one. I don't need you anymore.

>Once, I needed you. When my mom died, I really could have used a dad. I could have used anybody. When she died, there wasn't even anybody there. No one cared about us. I spent three days in that apartment, eating toast and just waiting for her to wake up.

>And then they called you. Because you were my dad. You were twenty three, young, but not so young really. If you had came and gotten me, you would have had a son. I would have loved you forever.

>But you didn't. So I went to a bunch of people who didn't love me, but liked the check they got with me. It didn't make them treat me well. I have burn marks on my arm and I still can't spend time in closed in dark spaces after being shut in closets. An afternoon is a long time when you can't count.

>I didn't count on anybody. I used to pray, the way mom did with me when I was little. But after praying for someone to come and rescue me, long enough, hiding under my bed and praying that my foster dad wouldn't come in and would leave me alone for just one night. Just one night. I stopped believing in most things.

>I lived in seven different homes from 4-16. And even the decent ones, I was never family. I didn't have real birthdays or christmases. I wasn't allowed to go in the fridge and just get food when I Was hungry.

>When I was 16 me and my foster dad got in a fight over a ham sandwich. ""Boy, what are you doing in our things?"". And so, I left. Sixteen, with nobody to call, and 40 bucks. I just walked away with a backpack. Anything could've happened to me.

>But I made it. I'm a man now. And I don't need you. I don't want you to feel bad. I just want you to know why I can't be your son. I'm 24 and have never been any one's son. I don't know how. And I just don't have it in me.

>Jackson

[**Comment on r/fosterit: Lets make a list of kids that overcame.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fosterit/comments/100plj/comment/c6llkim/?context=3)

*Well, I am not some celebrity success story, but considering my poor placements and the fact that I ran away from the foster system and high school when I was 16, I think I might roughly qualify for ending up a pretty average guy.*

*I'm 24 and work as an electrician- I have an associates in it (who would've guessed I'd go to college? No one.). I went to school when I was 19 after I got my GED. I'm married with two kids- the oldest is three and the youngest is seven months. And I'm a really good dad. Which surprised me because I never had one, but I adore my kids. I would walk on fire for them.*

*I'm happy. And I think that blue-collar, middle-class living suits me. I honestly thought I'd end up in prison or something but instead I found this life.*

*I let her drop me off at work. We only have one car and she is a SAHM. She doesn't usually have any need of the car, but she likes to have the ability so I get up earlier and wait for the pick up. It's worth it.*

*The wife is good about brushing her hair and putting on shoes and heading out. But we've got a three yr old and a baby. The daughter wants breakfast or has to go to the potty, My son needs his diaper bag, etc. Kids are all about contingency time.*

*I never owned a bike. I also never wanted to be anything as a kid. I knew theoretically that one day I would grow up and need a job, but I never thought I could be a doctor or an accountant or an astronaut or anything.*

1mrwgho,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrwgho,"All Done - Misaligned Teeth, Crowding, and Minor Gum Recession","Hi everyone! I recently finished my Invisalign and figured I’d share my progress for folks in similar situations. 

I started my first tray January 26, 2024 and finished my last tray July 14, 2025 getting my buttons off, doing the little shaving of my teeth ends, and my final scan for my retainer. 

I had pretty severe crowding of 3 teeth on one side, my front two teeth were being pushed back, my side front teeth were all messed up because they had no room to move, and I had some gum recession on a few of my teeth. Generally speaking, the alignment of my teeth now I’m quite happy with and some of my gum recession has improved. 

I started my Invisalign, then two weeks in got my wisdom teeth removed. Apparently this makes it so your teeth move more easily as your mouth is healing and it of course provided the room my teeth needed to actually fit in my mouth. 

I had my one week trays which I wore religiously for 21-22 hours each day for the first year. The last few months I got a bit lazy and ended up scanning every 10 days or so a few times so I might have been able to finish a little bit earlier, but I’m happy with the duration of 1.5 years. I actually expected it to be quite a bit longer.

I had a bunch of buttons/attachments and did end up having rubber bands for a few weeks as well to fix my bite. I would say the general process went super smoothly up until I started rubber bands. I was not a huge fan of them because I have pretty bad headaches regularly and I felt like the rubber bands made me clench more at night resulting in jaw pain and some headaches. I switched from wearing them at night to wearing them in the day for 10 hours since that was more comfortable for me. 

Cost wise, I don’t quite remember the exact amount and can’t find my receipt, but it certainly wasn’t cheap and I do wish I shopped around a bit more. I BELIEVE it cost around $8,300 and with insurance it dropped to around $6,500. The cost for sure stung a bit. 

You can see my pics for before and after. All my scan photos still have buttons in them, but the last photo is of me after my last session with buttons removed and my teeth ends shaved. 

I would say I generally had a great experience with my Invisalign. I read mixed things on the teeth end shavings after I had some sensitivity post having that done, but it’s been slowly subsiding and my ortho said it could just be from us doing a lot the last appointment. My only next step is to whiten my teeth because I did drink coffee in my Invisalign which discolored my teeth quite a bit (not that they were very white before). I do have a few gaps left over that are a bit annoying and get food trapped in them, so I carry around floss picks at all times. I also have one other chipped tooth on my bottom I need to take care of, but my ortho recommended waiting a bit before starting that process. I’m currently wearing my Invisalign retainer (actual retainer and not movement tray) for 3 months using the same 20-24 hours a day rule and then it’ll only be a nightly routine. 

More so than anything though, I feel so much more confident now! I would always smile with my mouth closed or cover my mouth when I smiled, whereas now I smile and show it off as much as I can! 

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have! I’m on mobile so I apologize for any formatting issues :)",11,1755353689.0,Invisalign,5,1.0,False
