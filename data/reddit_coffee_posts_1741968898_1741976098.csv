1jb9vp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jb9vp4/aita_for_going_no_contact_with_my_dads_side_of/,AITA for going no contact with my dad's side of the family for how they treat my mom?,"Hi, I'm Nia (22F), and I need some level headed point of view of my situation 'cause I fear I might be overreacting.

Let's get some context, my mom (45F) and my dad (56M) married just because he got her pregnant, so you can already guess how this is going to go - my dad used to be very abusive to her, to the point of kicking her when she was carrying me in her belly, he has changed a bit and now my mom is stepping up more to confront him, so there are no more physical blows but still, not the ideal relationship. This is going to sound very clich√©, but my dad's side of the family is rich, like stinking rich, and my mom comes from a very humble background with a small family business, so my dad's side of the family always treated my mom more like a servant, still, my mom tried and tried for years to fit in, and that gets us here.

More backstory because this will get confusing, there's this aunt, we'll call her 'N', she is a witch and a bitch, a hyprocrite in all sense of the word, and she's never liked my mom ‚Äî N's husband left her (not divorced) because she was psychotic, held a knife to her baby's throat and everything, so he left and now he has a new girlfriend his age, who is my mom's best friend ‚Äî I know why N hates my mom, ofc, still that never never justifies how much shit he has talked about my mom and how she excludes her from everything, even when my mom is right in front of her.

Last year, October, it was my cousins's first communion, so everyone gathered, including N, my mom, and my brother (13M), please note that my dad didn't attend. When we got to a restaurant to celebrate, everyone was gathered at a big table, and my grandma (dad's mom) guided us to a small table for four that was far away from the main table (for only me, my mom and brother to sit), a few uncles and aunts had gathered there to make us not feel bad, but the implications were very very clear. Just so you know, I had an important presentation that day worth 60% of my grade, so I was constantly checking my laptop for my turn, time came for us to leave and my mom exploded in the car, saying how awful they had treated us and how they don't even see us as family. My dad and my mom had a lengthy discussion, and my dad suggested for my mom to send a message to set boundaries with his brother and sister (my uncle, P, and my aunt, M), so my mom did ‚Äî short message, just saying that she loved them very deeply, and that it'd be best if they didn't invite us to parties or events that N was invited to.

Well, my uncle and aunt replied in the most confusing way ‚Äî saying that it was my cousins's special day and they were the main focus, not anyone else, basically making it seem like my mom was seeking for attention, which she wasn't ‚Äî plus, my uncle P started talking shit about me, that I had been so attached to the technology, that I didn't give a fuck about my cousins's even when I explained that I was making a huge effort and risking my presentation being there. My mom left the family groupchat, my dad argued with her a lot and we didn't see them for a few months. We used to hang out a lot with my uncle P and my aunt M, but after that it went radio silent.

Christmas rolls around, my dad legit forces my mom, me and my brother to attend Christmas dinner at his family's house, and it's uncomfortable as hell, I felt so bad because no one would look in our direction, or talk to us, it's like we weren't even there. My mom tried to tell this to my dad but he yelled that it was his family and defended them ‚Äî we learnt our lesson, for New Years we weren't there, my dad bregudgingly staying home too.

I went no contact with my whole dad's side of the family, and I didn't really care ‚Äî I never belonged there anywhere, and where my mom isn't welcomed, I am also not welcomed.

Anyways, here's the real big issue. My mom's brother (my uncle, V) died suddenly of a heart attack a week ago, and my mom was and still distraught, she broke down and started scrambling ways to go back to her hometown to arrange the funeral with the rest of her siblings, and my dad had the AUDACITY to order her to not use the family car because it'd mess up the mileage and reduce the car's value. My mom is unemployed and my dad is the one who pays for everything, but still, he was so cold. My mom had to call one of her friends who drove eight hours with her to her hometown where everything was arranged ‚Äî my dad didn't lift one finger to offer to pay for anything, not even for a coffee or a bread for my mom's family, nothing.

Last Sunday, my dad finally offered to take us (my mom, me and my brother) to my mom's hometown so we could visit his grave, but he complained all the way to and from ‚Äî I had to argue with him because he told my mom 'You don't know how much I regret offering to even come here' ‚Äî on another note, my aunt M did send my mom her condolensces in a short but sweet message, and that's that, but I'm still not talking to her and neither is my mom (though she did thank my aunt).

This Sunday, there's an event that the only aunt I tolerate (aunt R) is nagging us all to go, but aunt N will be there alongside uncle P and aunt M ‚Äî at first me and my mom were firm, but after guilt tripping well we both caved in so we're going, the thing is I want to stay no contact with my dad's side of the family, that means I won't keep up appearances simply to say hi, I'll ignore them all, but my mom is thinking maybe that's a bit too harsh (bless her heart, this woman has done so much for my dad's side of the family), so I need some clear advice from people impartial to all this.

AITA if I stick to being no contact with my dad's side of the family, even if that means ignoring them and possibly making my dad angry? Help",4,1741974438.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

Whether you're ‚Äãa busy professional, ‚Äça seasoned traveler, or simply someone ‚Å£who appreciates a good cup of joe, we've got you ‚Äçcovered. We'll dive into the features, benefits,‚Å§ and considerations to help you make an informed decision. Let's explore the top contenders and discover your perfect brew!

## Why Choose a ceramic Travel ‚Å¢Coffee Mug?

Before we delve into specific ‚Å£models, let's address the elephant in the room: why choose a **ceramic travel coffee mug** over other ‚Äçmaterials like stainless steel or plastic? The ‚Äåanswer lies in ‚Å¢a ‚Å¢combination of factors that ‚Å§cater‚Äå to the modern consumer's desire for quality, taste, and sustainability.

   **The Taste‚Å§ Factor:** One of the biggest advantages of ceramic is its inert nature. Unlike‚Å§ plastic‚Äã or metal, ‚Äåceramic doesn't impart ‚Äåany unwanted flavors or odors to‚Äã your beverage. This‚Å¢ allows you to‚Äç fully savor ‚Å¢the rich and nuanced flavors of your coffee or tea,providing a truly authentic and ‚Å¢enjoyable experience. Imagine ‚Å§enjoying your carefully roasted beans ‚Å¢without the lingering metallic tang ‚Äì that's the power of ceramic. This ensures a much‚Å§ more‚Å§ refined experience than many other travel mug options.

   **Eco-Friendly Choice:** In‚Å£ an increasingly environmentally conscious world,‚Äå choosing a **ceramic travel mug eco‚Äç friendly** option is a significant ‚Äçstep ‚Äåtowards reducing your carbon footprint. Unlike disposable cups that contribute to landfill waste,‚Å¢ a reusable ceramic mug promotes‚Å§ sustainability. By opting for ceramic, you're actively participating in a more responsible and‚Å¢ eco-friendly lifestyle.

   **Stylish and Aesthetic:** ‚ÄåForget ‚Å§the generic, industrial look of some‚Äã travel mugs.‚Å¢ **Stylish ceramic travel ‚Äãmugs** are available in ‚Å§a‚Å§ wide array of colors, ‚Å£patterns, and ‚Äçdesigns.This allows you to express your personal style while enjoying your favorite beverage. From minimalist designs‚Äå to intricate ‚Å£patterns, there's ‚Å£a ‚Å§ceramic travel‚Å£ mug to match every taste‚Å£ and aesthetic preference.A **handmade ceramic travel mug** can even serve as a conversation starter and a‚Å£ reflection of your‚Å§ recognition‚Å¢ for artisanal craftsmanship.

   **Health and Wellness:** ‚Äã Many people‚Äã actively‚Äå avoid plastic for health‚Å£ reasons. Choosing a ceramic mug ‚Äçis a way to avoid potential leaching of chemicals that can occur‚Å£ with some plastics,especially when heated.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a Ceramic Travel Mug

Now that we've established ‚Å¢the benefits of ceramic, let's explore ‚Å§the key ‚Äåfeatures you should consider when selecting the perfect ‚Å¢mug for your needs.

   **Insulation:** Not all ceramic travel mugs are created equal when ‚Äåit comes to insulation. A **ceramic insulated travel ‚Äåmug** is crucial‚Äã for keeping your drinks hot or cold‚Äç for‚Å£ extended periods. ‚Å§Look for double-walled ceramic construction, which‚Äå creates a vacuum ‚Å¢seal that minimizes heat transfer. Some mugs also feature copper linings for enhanced insulation.‚Äç Consider how long you typically need your‚Äç beverage to stay hot or cold and choose accordingly. for longer commutes or travel, a‚Äå more heavily‚Äç insulated mug is a must.References like RTIC offer options that keep drinks hot for up to‚Äã 6 hours.

   **Lid ‚ÄãDesign and Spill-Proofing:** A reliable lid is paramount for any travel mug, especially if ‚Å§you're a commuter or prone to‚Å£ spills. Look for ‚Äãa **ceramic travel mug with lid** that fits snugly and ‚Äåcreates a secure seal. A **ceramic travel mug ‚Äåspill proof** design‚Å§ is ideal to prevent messes in your car, bag, or office. Some lids feature sliding closures, while others have flip-top mechanisms. Consider your personal preference and ‚Äçthe level of spill-proofing‚Äã you require.

*   **Durability:** While ceramic‚Äå is known for its ‚Å£aesthetics and taste‚Äã neutrality, it's ‚Äçnot as inherently durable as stainless steel.‚Å£ However, manufacturers are ‚Å¢addressing this‚Äç concern by‚Äã using high-quality‚Äã ceramic ‚Äçmaterials and reinforcing ‚Å£vulnerable areas. Search for a **durable‚Å¢ ceramic‚Äç travel mug** that can withstand ‚Äçeveryday wear and tear. Some mugs also feature protective silicone sleeves or bumpers to minimize ‚Äåthe risk of breakage.*   **Size and Portability:** Consider the size and shape of the mug to ensure it fits comfortably in your‚Å£ hand and in your car's cup holder. A **ceramic‚Äå travel‚Å£ mug portable** design is essential for those who ‚Äåare constantly on ‚Å§the move. Smaller sizes are generally easier to carry, ‚Å¢while larger mugs offer more capacity for those who need a bigger dose of caffeine.

   **Ease of Cleaning:** Nobody wants to spend ages scrubbing ‚Å§coffee stains ‚Å¢from their travel ‚Äãmug. opt‚Å¢ for a **ceramic travel mug‚Äç dishwasher safe** model for ‚Å¢easy ‚Å¢cleaning.‚Äç If hand-washing is required, ensure the‚Äã mug has a smooth,‚Äç non-porous surface that's easy to‚Äå clean with soap and water. A simple lid‚Å£ design‚Äå with ‚Å£minimal parts also ‚Å§simplifies the cleaning process.

   **Handle‚Äç vs. No ‚Å£Handle:** A **ceramic travel mug with ‚Äåhandle** can provide a more secure and ‚Äãpleasant grip, especially when ‚Å¢the mug is full. Though,handle-less designs are frequently enough more ‚Å§compact‚Å§ and easier‚Å¢ to fit‚Å¢ in cup holders.Consider your personal preference and how you typically hold your travel ‚Äåmug.

   **Customization and Personalization:** For a truly unique touch, consider a **custom ceramic travel mug** or a **personalized ceramic‚Å¢ travel mug**. Many online retailers offer options to add‚Å¢ your name, initials, or a custom ‚Å§design to your mug. This ‚Äãmakes it a perfect‚Äå gift for friends, family, or colleagues.

I've made it to Friday and I'm still alive! To celebrate this momentous occasion, I figured it would be fun to chat with some fellow Reddit dwellers. I'm already in my cosy clothes and have a pizza ready to chuck in the oven, so I'm all set.

I'm pretty easygoing in terms of what I'm looking for. Anything from casual chit chat to meeting up is good with me. Life can be way too serious sometimes, so I'm looking for something fun :).

In terms of things about me... I'd describe myself as analytical, silly, warm, and reliable. I work a professional job in London (boring!), but I like to enjoy myself outside of work. At the moment, I play in a band and sometimes write my own music (when I'm inspired!). Otherwise, I enjoy typical millenial blokey stuff like video games, running, reading, and buying overpriced coffee.

In terms of appearance, I'm 5'9"" (sorrynotsorry), White, Slim, Shaved head and bearded. I won't be on a catwalk any time soon, but I'm alright to look at.

1jb9q6l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jb9q6l,Vent - My grandfather is a facebook warrior,"My grandfather is on a sick one. In the last week, he has tried to call out my cousin for going no-contact with his mother, and supporting his baby‚Äôs mother going no contact with her, including removing her privileges to speak to their children. On one hand, my cousin and grandfather are on serious outs and haven‚Äôt spoken to each other in years, however messenger is a click away and could have been taken there. 

My grandfather and I however, speak on the phone or exchange texts throughout the week. I saw he liked a post I made of my toddler, and I guess he scrolled through my facebook, then posted Photo 1 on my timeline. 

I lost my mother about a decade ago, just a little over. I had a complicated relationship with her, she was nineteen when she had me and I grew up a bit closer with my grandparents until I was in elementary school, when my mom had gotten some career stuff sorted out. When her and my step-dad separated when I was a preteen, she turned to alcohol and other substances to cope, and our relationship changed a lot, though we did have some issues already beforehand. Once she passed, I went back and forth between living with my bio-dad and my grandparents, both being very insecure experiences for their own reasons. But once my dad was out of the picture again, I started living with my grandparents and a different cousin, from ages 14 to 23. And boy, was it hell! I‚Äôll spare many many details and keep those tucked away for therapy. I will say, my grandfather and I have experienced many explosive fights, many of which he‚Äôs threatened to kick me out, he‚Äôs thrown things ‚Äúat‚Äù me (he will say he threw them on the ground, in his defense, though half the time they‚Äôd hit my feet. items include but are not limited to: remote controls, cups of coffee, other dishes, and phones), cussed at me, made fun of me, and scream like an ogre in my face. He once even did all of those things in front of my barely one year old, as I tried to bathe her in the sink.  The only reason I haven‚Äôt followed my cousins lead and gone no contact is because despite all of that, I have lived in home mostly rent free (and when I did pay ‚Äúrent‚Äù it was practically pocket change), he‚Äôs co-signed a car for me that I still owe him money on, and over the years he has come through for me when I really needed it. It‚Äôs hard to say whether the good outweighs the bad, but I feel like I owe it to him to keep him in my life and my daughter‚Äôs life. We live in a different state now where all the verbal abuse isn‚Äôt in reach of my daughter, so I‚Äôm not worried about that. 

ANYWAYS, blah blah backstory over‚Ä¶. After I read what he posted on my timeline, I started typing these huge paragraphs (photos 2 & 3) Just when I‚Äôm wrapping up the text, I think to myself, why does he think I‚Äôm talking bad about my mother? I mean, I do. But, where is he getting this? I have briefly had a hang out with my aunt, who also recently stayed with him a couple of days, but my mother wasn‚Äôt a HUGE topic of discussion. In fact, he was a bigger vent of frustration between my aunt and I. Anyone else who I may speak about my mother to are not extremely fond of my grandfather (in fact, not many people are fond of him in general) so? Then, I looked at my facebook, it didn‚Äôt take much scrolling to see a meme I shared, about housing instability. It was a ‚Äústarter pack‚Äù meme, that I shared with the caption ‚Äòidk why my mom couldn‚Äôt renew a lease‚Äô (within 13 years, I had moved houses at least once a year, but oftentimes more. i‚Äôve tallied up the total of how many times i‚Äôve switched schools in my life, the total is 20, with a majority of those being from before I hit middle school, i wish i were exaggerating.) That‚Äôs the ill will I‚Äôm being told not to talk about? That my mom didn‚Äôt renew leases and that affected me? Oh, Jesus Christ, get a grip. Once I realized that, I thought maybe such a stupid thing didn‚Äôt deserve this much energy. But I had typed out a lot, and I still sent it. Hehe. 

Maybe I feel a little hypocritical knowing I‚Äôm making this reddit‚Äôs business, but genuinely, where does he get off posting this on facebook? I realize maybe it was convenient seeing it posted on my tl so he just quickly typed up what he had to say on my tl as well. Besides some memes and photos of my toddler, I do not post much on facebook, especially personal things. I don‚Äôt know why my grandfather thinks it‚Äôs appropriate to do so. I also just don‚Äôt understand why he thinks he can dictate what I say about my mother ANYWAYS. ",1,1741974051.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False
1jb9pde,https://www.reddit.com/r/teamjustinbaldoni/comments/1jb9pde/is_blake_lively_actually_40_years_old/,Is Blake Lively Actually 40 Years Old?,"*Conspiracy hypothesis:* was Blake Lively born in 1984 as opposed to 1987? 

I present the following information for consideration and discussion:

Blake Lively‚Äôs Mother Elaine was born in 1947. 

Data^(a) arranged in the following sequential order: 

TABLE 1: ‚ÄúThe Lively Siblings‚Äù as arranged via Ascending Child‚Äôs Year of Birth, Child‚Äôs Name, Mother‚Äôs Age at Parturition (years; for simplicity, rounded to age Elaine turned in the corresponding year) [*Sources*: (1-3)]

1966: Lori born, Elaine 19

*<2 year age gap>*

1968: Jason born, Elaine 21

*<4 year age gap>*

1972: Robyn born, Elaine 25

*Interim: Elaine Divorces Ronnie; 1979: Marries Earnie*

*<9 year age gap>*

1981: Eric born, Elaine is 34

*<6 year age gap>*

1987: Blake born, Elaine is 40


I always found the following to be curious: *‚ÄùAlthough Blake debated a career on the silver screen, she credited her brother Eric for being supportive. The Simple Favor star revealed that when she was 15 years old, they traveled around Europe together and he often quizzed her on what she wanted to do in the future‚Äù*(1)

Really? Blake (15) travelling around Europe with her brother Eric (21)? Interesting. 

*Or could it be that Blake was actually 18 years old and travelling around Europe with her 21 year old brother?* 

Many of us have either experienced the thrills of traveling young, backpacking around Europe or at least vicariously wished to do so after watching the 2004 comedy *EuroTrip* (*RIP Michelle!*üïäÔ∏èüíó).

Now most the thrills and spills of travelling arguably aren‚Äôt experienced to their full extent until you‚Äôre of age - which legally is determined in most European countries to be 18.

Would it not make more sense for a 21 year old brother and 18 year old sister to travel as a pair at 21 and 18 respectively, rather than 21 and 15? 

Would it not make more sense for a 21 year old brother to ‚Äúoften quiz‚Äù (1) his 18 year old sister ‚Äúabout what she wanted to do in her future‚Äù (1) than a 15 year old who‚Äôs still may be finding their feet in High School? 

‚ÄºÔ∏è Now consider this curious recollection from Blake ‚ÄºÔ∏è

*""When I was only 3 years old, my mom enrolled me in the first grade. My older brother was supposed to start school, but he didn't want to go alone, so my mom told them I was 6 since I was so tall,"" Blake said in an interview with Marie Claire in it's December issue. ""But after a few weeks, they said they would have to put me in mentally disabled classes because I wasn't up to pace with the rest of the kids.""* (4)

*The actress said her toddler instinct to for naptime wasn't welcomed in her first grade class.* (4)

*‚ÄùThey thought that I was slow because all I wanted to do was sleep while the other kids were doing their projects,"" she said with a laugh. ""So my mom took me out of school.""* (4)

My first reaction was this is horrific! This is child abuse, sending a 3 year old to school to be of emotional support to her 6 year old brother.  How traumatic for Blake! 

Astute user u/seaseahorse immediately detected a discrepancy in the timeline - pointing out that in the aforementioned anecdote, Blake points out that she‚Äôs 3 years old and neither Eric is 6. 

However! 

Media record shows that Eric was 6 years older than Blake - meaning when Eric was 6 and entering First Grade, Blake would have been a newborn! OR if Blake was in actuality 3 years old, according to the published data, Eric would have been 9! 

How curious üßê

I hypothesize that Blake Lively may actually have been born in 1984, making her 3 years younger than Eric at 6 years old. Making Blake 18 when she travelled Europe with Eric at 21 years old.

Blake who it‚Äôs always been observed, looks a little older than her age? 

BUT THATS CRAZY! WHY WOULD A WOMAN IN HOLLYWOOD LIE ABOUT HER AGE?

Well if she did, she‚Äôd be in good company! So many in fact that it would seem fudging your age a little is a Hollywood prerequisite. So many celebs have lied throughout the ages about their ages! 

There‚Äôs Eminem, Mila Kunis, Hilary Duff, Rebel Wilson, Niki Minaj, Ryan Reynolds‚Äô very own previous co-star, Sandra Bullock‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs just for starters (5)

So can we add Blake Lively to that list? Not so fast - let‚Äôs think about this‚Ä¶maybe Blake lied about the Grade School story with Eric? Maybe Blake was a newborn and grew into a woman with a great imagination and/or a propensity to lie?

Or perhaps Blake really was 3 when her mother sent her off to GRADE ONE with her 6 year old brother. Who would notice? ‚Ä¶*Well, even if Blake was a tall toddler, 3 year olds and 6 years olds look and behave markedly different in my experience‚Ä¶and Blake admittedly concedes that the school sure did notice and her mother, perhaps in her guilt, then indulged Blake with frequent trips to Disney. 

As explained by NBC Chicago, *Blake's mom might have caused concern when she lied about her daughter's age, but she made up for it with frequent childhood trips to Disneyland.*

*‚ÄùI kind of feel like I grew up at Disneyland,"" Blake explained. ""My mom would take me there twice a week. I did well in school, so I guess my mom just wanted to have some extra time to bond with me. Sometimes, when I was older, she'd keep me out till one in the morning. We only stayed out late on weekends. We'd get a hotel room and then go to Denny's, drink coffee, and talk for hours.""*

*Blake says her late night adventures with her mom have helped her to become a better actress‚Äù*

*‚ÄùI've always been a night owl. Even at home, we'd stay up all night talking. My mom tells the most amazing stories,"" she told the mag. ""In a way, she was kind of raising me to be a great actress without even realizing it.""*

So perhaps Blake at 3 years old really was ordered to attend Elementary School and consequently recalled the events of that traumatic time that likely burnt into her psyche? Maybe Blake was not lying as she recalled that traumatic memory.

Perhaps the grim truth is that Blake Lively was a 3 year old enrolled in Grade One, alongside her 6 year old brother? 

Perhaps in Blake‚Äôs recollection of this trauma to the media, she inadvertently slipped up in that she revealed the truth of her age? 

If Blake was born August 25, 1984 rather than 1987, that would today make her 40 years old, turning 41 this August. 

As opposed to Blake‚Äôs age on public record, which is 37, turning 38 this year. 

Hmm‚Ä¶what do you think? ü§î 

Is it possible Blake Lively has not been truthful about her age?

Is Blake Lively actually 40 years old?

Then what happened when I went to the counter, I noticed the cashier took a single sachet of the coffee then punched it in. I thought it was weird because she's supposed to punch the SKU of the whole pack not a single sachet.

I didn't mind at the time because I got distracted and thinking na baka wala lang siyang difference sa pricing ng product. Until I saw the receipt, it was 240. Because 1 sachet costs 5 pesos pala. So 5 x 48 pcs = 240.

As non-confrontational person, I was conflicted to react or what. So when I got home, I asked my partner to ask for an explanation.

Ang sabi ng cashier, as convenience store, they will sell it per piece and not as a pack. In my defense, it's inside the plastic--sealed. So bakit ibebenta nila ng per piece??? Gets ba?

So my question is tama ba sila in doing it? Is there a consumer act or what na cover ang concern ko? Coz this hilarious and outright nonsense.

However, a new study suggests that drinking two cans of soda a day may increase your risk of dying.

The study on soda.

For the study, the researchers analyzed data from over 460,000 adults in 10 European nations. They didn't find any signs of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer when they started the study.

Over the years, the researchers followed the participants and found that 41,693 of them died.

Although fruit juice was not included in the study, it did look into various types of soft drinks, such as energy drinks and diet sodas.

After excluding various factors that could influence a person's health, such as education, smoking, and BMI, the researchers discovered that those who drank two or more glasses of soda a day were more prone to dying.

Men and women were more prone to experiencing higher death rates from all causes. They also had a higher risk of dying from digestive disorders and circulatory diseases.

Regardless of whether or not BMI was included in the analysis, the results of the study still showed that drinking two or more cans of soda per day was associated with higher death rates.

Contrary to what was expected, the researchers did not find a link between regular soda consumption and cancer death.

The study's results were presented in an article published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.

Tips for quitting soda.

If you're addicted to soda, it's likely that quitting will be difficult. Here are some tips to help you kick the habit.

To help break the craving, try replacing caffeinated sodas with non-caffeinated alternatives.

You should stock up on other non-soda beverages to avoid going to the store. Some of these include tea, seltzer, or flavored water.

1jb9gsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1jb9gsk/my_list_of_coffee_shops_around_indy_rated_110/,My list of coffee shops around Indy rated 1-10 (UPDATED),"So I took a lot of people's recommendations and tried some new coffee shops! Therefore, I have updated my personal list.

Some friendly reminders: I personally am a huge flavored latte fan. Because of that, I only go to coffee shops that have or use housemade/locally made syrups. I got a lot of discourse on my old post about it, and my feelings remain the same. I feel that it's lazy to use torani or monin syrups. I feel that if you're going to go out of your way as a coffee shop to roast or use high quality beans, you are ruining the taste of your delicious espresso by using ultra-processed syrup. It's just my opinion. I can always taste when it's not housemade, so I avoid going to those cafes all together. Also, I personally don't like Starbucks. I am extremely picky when it comes to my lattes. So please, take my list with a grain of salt if you're not one who likes fairly sweet, flavored lattes.

Also a side note, convenience is very important to me. parking, knowing the menu ahead of time, location, ect. is all fairly important to me. I avoided coffee shops like quills coffee for example, because I couldn't find their menu online, and when I called, it wanted me to give a call-back number. stuff like that is very irritating to me. I'm a pretty orderly person, so things like that are just frustrating.

* MOTW coffee 2/10 ‚Äî awful service when I went. I ordered a biscoff latte. the barista poured the espresso with chunks of biscoff butter over ice, then milk. ew.
* neidhammer coffee co. 5/10 (NEW) - I was honestly really disappointed. I got the nutella latte, and it very bitter. the crepes were also super mediocre. not worth the money.
* provider 5/10 ‚Äî nice aesthetic of the place, but pretty small. overall the coffee was fine.
* bovaconti coffee 6/10 ‚Äî same with provider, but their service was wonderful.
* indie coffee roasters 6/10 (uses monin other than some sig drinks) ‚Äî their signature drinks have house made syrups, otherwise they use monin. their signature drinks are definitely worth a try.
* illumine coffee 6/10 (NEW) - it was okay, it's one of the few shops on this list that has monin syrups. I will say, they are in a very convenient spot. they have a lot of space, are open later than others, and have a lot nearby and good parking.
* amberson coffee & grocer 7/10 ‚Äî really cute, hole in the wall sort of place. the downside is if you‚Äôd like a to-go drink, they require you pay an extra dollar for a jar you bring back. not very convenient to use, messy if you‚Äôre moving at all and trying to take a sip. very yummy though.
* tinker coffee co. 7/10 ‚Äî pretty good! just nothing to write home about.
* JAVA house 7/10 ‚Äî probably the best cold brew i‚Äôve ever had.
* barista parlor 7/10 (NEW) - not bad! just kind of hard to find, and parking kind of sucked.
* prufrock coffee 8/10 ‚Äî the fun canning experience with a to go drink made it so much better. and, the coffee is really good.
* bluemind coffee 8/10 (NEW) - very yummy, and they had a banana drink! super fun flavors, and a very cute location.
* parlor coffee ‚Äî veryyy aesthetic looking, right next to a penn & beech (i think?) is also a bar, but their sig drinks are weird.
* commissary coffee 9/10 ‚Äî omg. one of my favorites. they‚Äôre also a bar!
* ascend coffee 9/10 ‚Äî genuinely the only good coffee around castleton. very kind people, and their seasonal menus are so good.
* dream palace coffee 9/10 (NEW) - truly a delight. parking fucking sucks though.
* YAFA golden coffee 10/10 (mainly just their pumpkin spice lattes) ‚Äî their pumpkin spice is to die for. best in the city. overall though, eh. they keep their pumpkin for a majority of the year though I believe.
* calvin fletchers 10/10 (NEW) - everyone was correct to say this place is DELICIOUS. super yummy coffee, fun seasonals, and they're next to my absolute favorite restaurant, bluebeard. get a latte and then run next door. 
* brickhouse coffee 10/10 (UPDATED) - PLEASE go here. the pastries are soooo good, they have lunch options, and if you love sweet lattes you need to try the triple b latte with their bourbon brown butter caramel syrup. truly a treat. they also sell their syrups! I literally love this place soooo much. 

I did see other recommendations, but once again I do prefer to look over the menu before I go somewhere, and I try to make it so the location is 25 minutes or less from where I am. I may update this list again, but I think this is a good stopping point. I hope my list helps my fellow espresso/latte lovers out there!",3,1741973401.0,indianapolis,2,1.0,False

I find his realistic takes on traditional fantasy tropes to be refreshing not only due how they are coloured by his Vietnam-soldier experiences but also because of how often  Jordan  points out how **FUNNY** these tropes are.

He just really knew what  he is doing here as a fantasy writer and I appreciate that so much. While his world is filled to the brink with nuanced world-building and epic stakes...he¬†*also*¬†understood that half the fun of fantasy is how absurd some of its tropes are when you really break them down.

 I just wanted to see if anyone‚Äôs had a similar experience to this at all. My ex broke up with me a little over 3 months ago because he said he was ‚Äúanxious, overwhelmed, felt guilty‚Äù in the relationship and was avoidant. Since the break up we kept talking casually around once a week, he seemed to be trying to fade out at some point but he agreed to have coffee with me when I asked for either that or a phone call 1.5 months after the break up. When we saw each other he said some stuff like ‚Äúwhat if I‚Äôm interested?‚Äù, that he has fun with me and not with many other people, that the relationship was obviously real, even though he got defensive when I said the breakup was hurtful.

 Since we had coffee together, even though he didn‚Äôt initiate, he started texting me a lot more and responding fast, explaining when he answered late why he did. We talked for talked for two saturday nights in a row and it felt like when were dating, just fun intellectual conversation. 

 Around 1 month after he was going on a trip so I asked if he wanted to hang out before and play this game we used to play together or go out to a barcade, he said maybe because he was really busy with preparing for the trip. 

 3 days after I checked in to confirm if he was too busy or wanted to and he suddenly didn‚Äôt reply. The next day I made a joke implying he was dead, and he joked back. Then disappeared again and has been ghosting me for the last week and a half.

 I‚Äôm so confused about it because we didn‚Äôt have an argument and were actually having great conversation before. He didn‚Äôt block me or unfollow me. The last few times I sent him a message he logged on right away and hovered online, so he‚Äôs obviously reading my messages.

I've taken the advice on board and updated my query, 285 words with the bio redacted. I've also pasted the first 300 words of my 1st chapter at the bottom. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

**QUERY:**

  
Dear agent,

Jennifer Hawkins is an aging D-list actress best known for her role as the ‚ÄúFinal Girl‚Äù in the corny 80s cult-classic Evil Elf franchise. But with her youth and glory days long behind her, she resentfully scrapes by on the convention circuit, where her meet-and-greet lines shrink year after year, and calls from her agent grow increasingly rare.¬†

In truth, Jennifer never really embraced her Scream Queen status, she felt above the cheesy material‚Äîand the genre as a whole‚Äîbut at least it paid her bills‚Ä¶ Until it didn't.

So when a horror super-fan offers her a starring role in a remake of Evil Elf, filmed on location at the original set, Tinseltown‚Äîa long-abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park in the Nevada desert‚ÄîJennifer is resistant. But that was before he offered her a huge sum of money.

Unfortunately, Jennifer‚Äôs return to ‚Äúshow business‚Äù isn‚Äôt the comeback she imagined. Facing grueling conditions and forced to reunite with actors from the franchise, including two ex-lovers. As she struggles with these complicated relationships, she remains unaware that the movie is actually a high-concept snuff film.

One by one, her co-stars are being murdered in disturbingly inventive ways. All the while, Jennifer believes it's part of the movie‚Äîuntil it's too late. Now the surviving cast members must fight to escape the sprawling, decaying theme park before they become part of the film‚Äôs final cut.

SCRIPT TO SCREAM is a literary horror novel complete at 75,000 words. It combines the social commentary of The Substance, highlighting the pitfalls of fame and the desperate measures we may take to stay relevant, with Paul Tremblay‚Äôs Horror Movie, exploring the horrors of making a film where the line between fiction and reality begins to blur.



**FIRST 300 word for 1st chapter:**

Jennifer Hawkins sat in the far corner of the local community center, a space usually reserved for over-60s bingo nights and kids' birthday parties. She glanced down at a dog-eared copy of her autobiography, *Behind the Blade: Confessions of a Final Girl*, propping up the corner of her table. She could spare it; a towering stack of books sat in front of her, and an extra box permanently resided in the trunk of her car.¬†

As Jennifer wrapped a manicured hand around her coffee cup, she glanced at an almost equally tall pile of glossy 8x10 photos. She flicked through them. Hundreds of blood-soaked Rebecca Sommers stared back at her.

More often than not, fans brought their own items for her to sign. VHS tapes, DVDs, posters, action figures, and once, her 1989 October edition of *Penthouse* when she was their ‚ÄòPet of the Month‚Äô. The centerfold was suspiciously sticky, but she signed it regardless. As long as you paid her $40 fee, Jennifer would sign anything you put in front of her.¬†

To pass the time, Jennifer played with her piles of items, shifting them this way and that. When this became tedious, she would then apply lip-gloss, run her nails over the table top, and then idly pick at her nails. However, this satisfying distraction was then ruined by the realization that continuing to do so would mean another expensive nail appointment. She sighed and stared around the room.

Convention guests of all ages, shapes and sizes were dressed as their favorite fictional characters. She observed three stormtroopers, one Klingon, nine Harley-Quinns and a whole lot of Deadpools.¬†

Some glanced her way, while others unabashedly stared, obviously trying to place her semi-familiar face. She figured they must have missed the giant banner hanging behind her displaying her face, name, *and* movie; so she turned to straighten it in a bid to remind them, her finger tracing the beginnings of another rip. She brought this banner to every meet-and-greet, and after years of being folded and unfolded, it was basically ninety-percent tape.",4,1741972531.0,PubTips,11,1.0,False

As vrea sa imi cumpar un teren, dar preturile sunt absurde, si in continua crestere. Nu inteleg pana cand?

Simt ca imi achizitionez o opera de arta, nu o nevoie de baza, gen un acoperis deasupra capului. Gasesc casele comuniste ale buniciilor de vanzare la 150k euro, evident cu igrasie si ce necesita multe reparatii. Apartamente la 150k euro, iar casele decente incep de la 250k euro in sus. Nu inteleg, am innebunit ca si popor? Pe ce considerent se cer preturile acestea?

Am cautat si comparat, la 300k euro imi cumpar casa in aproape orice oras european de dimensiunea oradiei. Diferenta e ca salarul acolo e de 3-4 ori mai mare, ai oportunitati profesionale, calitatea vietii mai buna, si exista mai multe de facut decat sa bei bere in weekend in aceleasi 3 localuri obosite.

Oradea e un oras mort, 2 evenimente pe an, lipsa de tineret, fara diversificare in localuri, restaurante/mancare, facultatea e de toata jena. Fara oportunitati profesionale, doar daca te multumesti sa fii barista la ceva coffee shop de specialitate pentru restul vietii tale, dar nu prea ai unde avansa mai departe. Iar mai presus de toate, majoritatea oradeniilor lucreaza pe minim pe economie, sau un pic peste. 

Mi se pare ca preturile sunt gras umflate de cand s-a renovat centrul orasului. Dar faptul ca ai o pietonala draguta nu iti ridica calitatea vietii. Nu iti imbogateste experienta de viata, nu iti aduce joburi mai bine platite, si cel mai important nu iti mareste salarul. Dar, in ciuda faptului, totul se scumpeste. Totul are dintr-o data valoare dubla.

Nu inteleg cum se gandesc unii ca 'casa mea valoreaza 300k euro' cand majoritatea arata penibil dpdv estetic si nu sunt gandite sa fie bine facute. Fiecare isi face de capul lui cum considera.

Mai demult te mutai in tara pentru ca era mai ieftin si vrei sa stai in tara ta. Acum e la acelasi pret. Nu vreau sa ma mut din oradea, dar aparent sunt fortat, pentru ca sunt mai atragatoare casele din afara. Este extrem de frustrant, pentru ca am prieteni familie aici, dar pur si simplu nu imi permit sa traiesc pe salarul asta, cu preturile la imobiliare. 

De ce nu se reglementeaza preturile la imobiliare? Este o nevoie de baza pana la urma, nu este o fi»õƒÉ sa ai o locuinta.

1jb8zph,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jb8zph/its_supposed_to_be_my_week_off/,It's supposed to be my week off...,"So I rarely get time off from work, I'm the head barista and I've been extremely stressed and burnt out with work recently due to health issues getting in the way of my job, so I booked this week off a few weeks back. 

For context, about 1/2 weeks ago I was training a new member of staff on how to use the coffee machine and when it came to tamping, she tried to tamp with the portafilter spout on the counter (cringe, I know) I stopped her immediately before she had the chance to tamp and potentially damage the portafilter, and demonstrated to her, again, how to tamp correctly. (I had already given her a demonstration on how to do this prior to asking her to pull a shot. She had also told me that she had worked in coffee shops and on coffee machines previously) Anyways, cut to a few days later and it's a day that I don't work, and I get a message from our coffee man asking if I knew whether the portafilter spout was still on, which obviously confused me, so I sent a text to my boss asking about it, to which she replied that it had been broken. I told her that we do have a spare portafilter so if she could just use that one for the time being it would be fine. I messaged our coffee guy back and said yes, it was broken, so he ordered us some new o rings and told me how to replace it once they arrived. Went in a few days later and the o rings were there but it was super busy so I asked my boss if I could just take it home and do it then. I feel like I'm waffling lol but basically I took the portafilter home, replaced the o ring and brought it back the next day, and put the other o ring that had also been delivered in my purse for safekeeping, and because I know for a fact that it would just get misplaced if I left it somewhere at work. I was also thinking that, because I have told everybody how NOT TO BREAK THE PORTAFILTER that we probably wouldn't have any use for it for a little while so i would just keep it safe.

Anyway - I am now on my annual leave and enjoying some peace and quiet and some rest and relaxation, when I get a text from one of my co-workers asking where I keep the o rings. Told her that it's actually in my purse and asked her if another portafilter had been broken and she said that yes, it was, and the same person who broke it last time fucking broke it again. Are you serious!!!!!! I told her I could come in tomorrow at some point and fix it and she asked if I could come in first thing and do it (we open at 7am and I live a 30 minute walk away, no car, no bus) I am extremely frustrated and I also have a long distance friend staying with me tonight and tomorrow night and I don't really want to just leave her alone here for an hour+ just to go and fix someone else's careless mistake. I know it's partly on me for having the o ring in my purse and not at work, but I feel like this wouldn't be an issue in the first place if this person who's managed to break a fairly pricey bit of equipment twice in the past two weeks had just listened to me in the first place???? And I just don't really see why I even need to go in and fix it considering the fact that we have a 2 group machine and 3 portafilters???

Am I being unreasonable for getting pissed off at this? I can't even have a week where I don't have to think about whatever is going on at work. ",8,1741972228.0,barista,11,1.0,False

Ok so...

I (18M) am meeting my crush (19F).. but I don't think this is a date... :(

Some context:

I met this girl back in 2023 on reddit actually..
We then started talking on insta, and it was just casual talks and all, until one day she literary sent me a voice note and I was like üò≥.

Anyway from that day forward we started talking on voice notes and this was also the time when I started liking her..

However I always felt that since she lives so far away from me, so seeing her in person felt a distant dream and I thought that I probably cannot fall in love with someone if I haven't met them in person..

Oh boy was I wrong.. lol

In 2024 I genuinely started falling for her.. and started making plans to eventually shift to a city near hers so that we could study in the same college.

But this was also when our conversations started to get few and far between, and btw.. she almost never messages first.. ( even till now.. )

I also made a few mistakes while talking to her, which resulted in me apoligizing a few times.. 

And it all culminated to about September of last year.. when I had sent her a flower reel ( she likes flowers, specially paper ones.. keep that in mind.. )
And she then sent me the message that will destroy me at that moment..

""This reminds me.. I was crushing heavily on this guy, and GUESS WHAT, HE LIKES ME TOO! I AM SO HAPPY""

I then felt that it just wasn't meant to be..
I tried to try my luck elsewhere but it just didn't work.. and tbh I probably still have not moved on from her if i am being honest.. 

Fast forward to today, we live in the same city now but talk very rarely.

At first I thought that I just haven't been with girls that much, which was why I had developed feelings for her. But now I have spend over a month here in college and made several girl besties which feel completely platonic to me.. so maybe she is just different

Like one day at like 1 am or something ( btw I wasn't even drunk ) I decided that I will send her a voicenote explaining whatever I feel about her while also apologising if I end up ruining her any current relationships...

And thankfully I didn't do that.. cause just a few weeks ago, I had just liked her story on Insta ( I know.. I know.. ) and she literally messaged me back.. and asked how my college was going.. and then she out of nowhere said that me and her should meet up... üò≥

And I was like: ""Sure if you're down then ok""

And she went: ""I am, I am, I am""

Anyway so.. yeah. My crush of 2 years wants to meet me.. but idk why it's giving me ""Bestie's hangout"" vibes instead of a date vibe.. and tbh i don‚Äôt know if she's even single or not.. and if she isn't then meeting me on coffee seems... weird.

Anyway.. my main takeaway from this ""date but not date"" would be to interact with her, have fun, and if i genuinely feel attracted to her.. I'll just confess because I genuinely want to either date her or move on and neither of these things are possible if I don't even confess..
And my mental health has already been quite affected due to this..

Oh and I am making and bringing her paper flowers with some perfume.. so hopefully that raises my chances a bit..

Anyway I think I have tried explaining my predicament as best as I could..

1. ENT visits - camera down throat and MRI - they said my tonsils are slightly inflamed by everything else is normal. They have no idea why I'm always thirsty/have dry mouth, neither do my GP or dentist. The tonsils are probably because I have CFS/ME (chronic illness, likely auto-immune but it's a whole controversial thing.) 
2. I drink a \*lot\* of water and never drink coffee or soda. It doesn't matter how much water I drink, my mouth feels dry and sticky, even if I've literally just drank a whole glass.
3. Mouth wash for dry mouth - it does absolutely nothing. Neither does gum. Brushing my teeth before recording helps a *little* but the effect is basicaly gone after 5 - 10 minutes. I haven't tried gel/artificial saliva yet, are they any good?
4. Changed my meds (unrelated conditions), and had periods of not taking *any* meds - it made no difference.
5. I've seen some people suggest having an apple before recording, but I'm allergic. Is there another fruit that's meant to be help? haha
6. I've adjusted my mic technique, singing off-axis etc. but it doesn't help much.

1jb8ouh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jb8ouh/prypiat_ferris_wheel/,prypiat ferris wheel,"The Pripyat Ferris Wheel is an aberration. It has no origin, it has no past. It just appeared.

At 1 AM, at the exact moment Chernobyl reactor 4 exploded, the wheel was there. There are no records of its construction, no plans, nor witnesses who remember having seen it before. It shouldn't exist. And yet, it exists.

The most disturbing thing is not its appearance, but its absolute uniqueness. Throughout the multiverse, where everything should repeat itself in infinite variations, there is no other Ferris wheel like it. None with the same structure, the same presence, the same essence. It is a mistake in reality, something that defies probability itself. As if it didn't come from this universe. Nor from any other.

The wheel ages and rusts, like any abandoned structure. But there are reports‚Ä¶ rumors. Sometimes, for a few minutes, it returns to its original state. Bright, impeccable, as if it had just been inaugurated. No one has been able to determine what causes it, or when it will happen again. They only know what happens. And that shouldn't happen.

The Pripyat Ferris Wheel is said to be a parasite on reality. That its mere existence distorts the fabric of causality around it. Which is the eye of something that looks from the outside, from a place where logic stops making sense.

What will happen when it finally collapses? When time and entropy consume it completely and there is nothing left but dust of what should never have been there.

Nobody knows.

But all those who have studied its existence agree on one thing:

We don't want to find out.

We have accessed information from more than 400 research bureaus throughout the multiverse. Each one has shared data about their own realities, the worlds they have explored, the laws that govern them. And in all of them, without exception, there is a Ferris wheel in Pripyat.

But they are normal.

Not in the sense in which we understand normality, of course. Some are impossible rotating triangles, others have geometric shapes that our minds cannot process. Some float, some are inverted, some rotate inwards in dimensions we should not be able to conceive. But, within their own logics and standards, they are all explainable structures.

All but one.

Ours.

The Ferris wheel of our Pripyat is anomalous even in comparison with the aberrations of other universes. It is wrong on a deeper, more fundamental level. It doesn't fit into our world, but it doesn't fit into any of the others either. The bureaus of other universes have begun to take an interest in her. Some have already sent teams to our reality, beings with capabilities that surpass us in technology and knowledge.

They come to investigate.

To understand what we have not been able to.

But there is something that worries me. They haven't told us what they're really looking for. They haven't told us if they've seen anything similar before. They have not told us if they have found other anomalies like this in their explorations.

They haven't told us what happened when they tried to find out too much.

For now, we wait for the results.

If they ever give us any.

Day 1 of the investigation

At 06:00 hours, 34 agents from different realities arrived, sent by their respective superiors with a single purpose: to investigate the Pripyat anomaly. Their expressions were serious, their words even more so. They explained that this structure not only threatened our existence, but that of their own universes. The Pripyat Ferris wheel, in its impossible form, represented a danger we did not fully understand.

They went through the files we had accumulated over the years. One report particularly caught their attention: the accounts of the last remaining witnesses in Pripyat in 1987. They claimed to have seen a crack open from the city to the nuclear plant, and an eye, a vast eye of darkness shrouded in white mist, watching them before disappearing.

The agents asked us the exact time when that happened. We did not give details. But the answer was obvious.

The same time reactor 4 exploded.

Throughout the day, agents scoured the area. They noticed that the radiation was at stable levels, which explained the presence of tourists in recent years. An encouraging sign. They approached the Ferris wheel and deployed devices of unknown nature. Their technology was advanced, too advanced for us. They did not explain how it worked, nor did they allow us to approach them. Whether it was out of confidence or arrogance, we don't know.

The hours passed. Nothing happened.

No anomalies, no vibrations, and no signs of the expected distortion were detected. Some began to get impatient. As night fell over the ghost town, the air was thick with the tension of waiting.

One of the agents, visibly irritated, muttered that he was expecting something more serious. Another, a scientist from an alternate reality, whispered to his companions something that was not intended for our ears:

‚ÄîThis reality is primitive and ignorant. Perhaps the supposed crack was just a collective hallucination. The light over Chernobyl in 1986 was a blue glow of ionizing radiation. Probably, radiation remnants in the air did the same thing in 1987, and these people mistook it for something supernatural.

He said it with disdain.

But what was most disturbing was not his arrogant tone. It was the fact that he came from a world where the Nazis won World War II.

We wonder how different their reality would be.

We wonder if, in his universe, his Pripyat Ferris wheel also existed.

We wondered if they had come here to learn‚Ä¶ or to make sure we didn't learn too much.

Day 2 of the investigation

Nothing.

Seismographs detected no activity on the Ferris wheel. It did not respond to vibrations, it did not emit strange fluctuations. The anomaly of the 2013 earthquake ‚Äî where everything shook except the wheel ‚Äî was carefully re-examined. They found no answers.

So they tried something else.

Several hands, some human, others with shapes we could barely understand, rose against the structure. They pushed. They hit. They used devices that seemed to alter gravity itself.

Nothing.

He didn't move. Not a millimeter.

But when they began to lose patience and lash out harder, something happened.

Not what they expected.

The wheel moved. A faint rusty squeak rose into the air. For an instant, it seemed like he might collapse, that his entire weight would tilt and fall.

But it didn't fall.

It stayed exactly as it was. As if it had never been touched. As if the effort of all those beings had meant absolutely nothing.

Frustration grew among researchers from other realities. They murmured among themselves, convinced that our reports were a farce, an exaggeration of primitive minds incapable of understanding science.

One of them, a scientist from reality Tt3 (a universe where the sky and ocean are blood red) stepped away with a sneer. While the others continued arguing, he looked at the base of the structure and found something that could be taken: a screw. Small, insignificant. A simple piece of rusty metal.

He tore it off the wheel easily and held it between his fingers.

""If this reality only offers a waste of time,"" he murmured, ""at least I will take a souvenir with me.""

Without further ado, he headed to the bureau room, activated his team's portal, and disappeared into the glow.

For the first time in two days, the Pripyat Ferris wheel had given way.

A screw.

Only one.

And that, for some reason, fills me with indescribable terror.

Day 3: The Mockery of the Multiverse

There's something I didn't mention before...

The investigation began on April 22, because every April 26, the Wheel of Fortune anomalies are reactivated. Every year.

We don't know why. We don't understand your pattern. But what is undeniable is that, on that date, things happen. Whispers in the wind, ownerless shadows, organic matter of something that should not exist. Sometimes entities. Abominations without defined form.

We have documented it for years.

That's why we started earlier. To make sure we are ready.

And yet, so far... nothing.

April 25 passed with the same absurd normality as the previous days.

The trees swayed their branches in the breeze.
The cold air was comfortable, too perfect to be real.
Scientists drank coffee, others beer. They told jokes. They read books.

They didn't care anymore.

They looked at us with disdain, with that arrogance of those who believe they have demonstrated the absurd.

They decided to carry out one last experiment with one of their most advanced devices: the ""Past Fluctor"", a machine capable of observing events in history with absolute precision.

They turned it on.

The result was devastating.

Through their monitors, they saw Soviet workers building the Ferris wheel. Men of flesh and blood. With plans. With tools. With materials extracted from the region.

Building it.

That image destroyed decades of evidence. He contradicted all the testimonies.

Soviet and Ukrainian documents claim that no one built the wheel. He just showed up the night reactor 4 exploded. The survivors, people who lived in Pripyat before the disaster, even my own grandfather, swear they never saw her before the evacuation.

But there it was.

Built normally.

The scientists from other realities burst into laughter. For them, this was the final blow. An irrefutable confirmation that we were wrong, that we had lost our sanity.

We were the mockery of the multiverse.

Some researchers left laughing out loud, while others looked at the monitors with mockery. What was impossible for us, for them was nothing more than a historical error, a simple confusion of a primitive and superstitious reality.

We knew something was going to happen tomorrow.

And we knew that when it happened, they would stop laughing.

But they were convinced that nothing would happen.

They informed us that on the morning of April 26, they would abandon this reality.

We insist. We asked them to stay until 2 AM.

Some accepted calmly. Others, annoying.

But in the end, they had no choice. Their superiors ordered them to stay.

And as midnight approached, the cold stopped feeling natural.

The wind stopped.

And the Ferris wheel creaked.

Only once.

But it was enough.

Day 5: The Frontier of Understanding

Scientists from other realities stayed up until midnight, some out of skepticism, others out of a duty imposed by their respective organizations. Nobody admitted it, but an uncomfortable feeling hung in the air, as if each of them were waiting for something without knowing exactly what.

Some seemed tired, even annoyed. Tomorrow they would leave, convinced that all this was nothing more than superstition and paranoia.

1:23:45

The air changed.

It didn't get colder or hotter. It just changed.

The wind stopped being wind and became something more‚Ä¶dense. It wasn't that it was blowing harder, but that it seemed to have weight, as if the atmosphere itself was becoming thicker, as if the lungs had to work extra hard to process it.

It was not an unfamiliar sensation.

It was a wrong feeling.

It was at that moment that the wheel of fortune moved.

Slowly.

Silent.

But the wind was blowing in the opposite direction.

It wasn't the wind.

The wheel should not have moved.

And yet, he did it.

The scientists remained silent. No one dared to speak, to suggest an explanation.

Then, everything went out.

The monitors.

Anomaly detectors.

The cameras.

Even digital clocks stopped telling time.

Devices that had been designed to withstand solar storms, electromagnetic pulses and interference of any kind... simply died.

There was no explosion.

There was no spark.

There was nothing.

Just digital darkness.

Scientists scrambled to restart their equipment, fingers wobbling on the control panels.

For two minutes, there was no response.

Two minutes of absolute silence.

And then‚Ä¶

The screens flickered.

The devices turned back on.

But the digital clocks no longer read 1:25.

They all showed the same time they had turned off.

1:23:45.

One of the K-7 reality scientists let out a shaky breath.

‚ÄîIt must have been interference from the wheel's electromagnetic field. Some kind of anomalous fluctuation.

The others accepted the explanation, although it did not seem to satisfy any of them. But it was better than accepting the other possibility.

The Ferris wheel was anomalous.

But not as we had proposed.

What they detected were electromagnetic waves with non-Euclidean patterns, energy flows that did not match any known form of matter, and structural components with impossible signatures. But everything lasted only a few minutes, which prevented them from analyzing it in depth.

They were not completely disappointed.

After all, there was something strange about the wheel.

2:00 AM.

The scientists informed their colleagues what had happened.

They analyzed the data and came to a conclusion:

""The wheel only generates blackout fields. A magnetic phenomenon with abnormal properties, but not significant enough to pose a danger.""

It was nothing.

It wasn't worth staying any longer.

They packed their things.

They lit the portals in the center of the BIA.

One by one, the scientists left for their respective realities.

Until it was the turn of the Tt3 reality scientists.

Something was wrong.

His portal did not turn on.

The technicians checked the machinery. There were no errors in the calculations. There were no calibration failures. The portal was simply not responding.

The Tt3 team leader frowned and looked at his watch.

1:23:45.

Flicker.

He looked at the other scientists' watches.

1:23:45.

The devices were active.

But time did not advance.

The Tt3 scientist swallowed and looked at his colleagues.

‚ÄîWhat time do you have on your watches?

One by one, each researcher looked at their devices.

The result was the same.

1:23:45.

The air felt thick again.

One of the scientists tried to contact their headquarters.

There was no response.

The technicians checked the systems again.

There was no fault.

But the portal still did not light up.

The Tt3 scientists felt that something was watching them.

There were no shadows.

There were no sounds.

There were no changes in the environment.

But something was there.

Expecting.

Day 5: The Screw of Oblivion

Panic began when the portals did not light up.

The BIA sent urgent messages to other agencies in the multiverse, informing them of the situation. Assistance, solutions, anything that could help the scientists of the Tt3 universe return home was requested.

The responses came within minutes, some mocking, others skeptical.

""Have you checked your portal?"" asked an F-9 reality technician. ‚ÄîMaybe it's a calibration error.

But it was not a calibration error.

The BIA portals operated through wormholes, connecting distant points in space and time. For the portal not to activate, there had to be something else.

Then a BIA investigator asked the question that froze everyone.

‚ÄîIf portals require space-time to operate‚Ä¶ what happens if space and time cease to exist?

The communication channel went silent.

Neither agency responded immediately.

The Tt3 scientists overheard the conversation. Panic devoured them.

One of them collapsed, his breathing labored.

Another clung to his head with both hands, mumbling meaningless numbers.

A third, trembling, whispered the truth that everyone avoided saying out loud.

‚ÄîOur reality‚Ä¶ is gone.

The BIA tried to maintain order. Technicians and agents ran in all directions, recalibrating devices, measuring quantum flows, searching for any hint of Tt3 reality.

Then, new news arrived.

Other agencies, after conducting their own investigations, confirmed the worst.

‚ÄîWe have sought its reality in the quantum flow. We found no traces of its existence. It's not that it has been destroyed... it's as if it never existed.

Terror swept through the room like a wave.

Shouting.

Cries.

Despair.

Some collapsed into the fetal position, unable to process what this meant.

The Tt3 scientists had not only lost their home.

His home had never been there.

It was a paradox.

There were no explosions.

There was no collapse.

Simply, their reality never had a beginning.

She was uprooted from time itself.

The concept of his existence had been retroactively erased, as if God himself had changed his mind when writing his history.

But how?

Then, someone remembered.

‚ÄîThe screw‚Ä¶

A Tt3 scientist took a screw from the Ferris wheel.

Suddenly, everything made sense.

The Ferris wheel should never have existed.

It was a paradoxical structure, an error in reality itself.

The fact that someone took a fragment of her and took it to another universe‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶was enough to trigger the collapse.

Tt3's home was not destroyed.

He was forgotten by existence.

Day 7: The Silence of Disappearance

Agents from other realities quickly arrived at the site. The Ferris wheel, that cursed monument, was there, motionless, but with something disturbing. The screw that a Tt3 reality team member had taken was in place.

Time seemed to have stopped in that moment. The screw had never been moved. There were no footprints, no trace of his disappearance. It was as if it had never been touched.

A chill ran through the scientists, who looked at the wheel, paralyzed. What did this mean? Had reality itself made the screw return to its origin? Or had everything, even the act of stealing it, been an illusion created by the structure itself?

The silence was overwhelming. The agents from other realities, with pale faces, began to murmur in low voices.

‚ÄîIt is prohibited to bring pieces of that thing into our realities. - said one of the agents, almost out of breath.

The words were like a dull scream in the minds of the Tt3 scientists. The Ferris wheel was not just an inexplicable phenomenon. It was a black hole in the very fabric of the multiverse. An anomaly capable of erasing, destroying and rewriting existence.

The Tt3 scientists remained silent. Terror took hold of them. They knew something had gone wrong, but they still didn't understand the magnitude of what was happening. His existence was being undone.

The days passed in the same tension, while the scientists tried to analyze the remains of the wheel and the screw, looking for some explanation that could make sense of what was happening. But the findings only added to the confusion.

Then, something strange happened with the watches.

The scientists of Tt3, who for so long had used clocks synchronized with the time stream of their reality, noticed something disturbing: time stopped.

They asked how these clocks worked, and the agents of the other realities explained to them that they measured the temporal flow of reality. If the clocks had stopped at 01:23:45...

An agent, with a trembling voice, whispered:

‚ÄîThen his reality disappeared at that time.

The impact of those words was absolute.

In several research rooms, scientists began to shout, some burst into tears, while others remained silent, completely stunned by the revelation. His watch had not stopped for time. He had stopped because there was no longer time to measure. His time no longer existed.

The horrible truth began to sink in: Tt3 had never existed. There was never a beginning. There was never a stable reality. It was as if they had never been part of the multiverse. They were not a forgotten story; They were a complete void.

Hours later, an echo of despair began to fill the walls of the facility. The screams died down, and then, absolute silence.

Shots.

At least three Tt3 scientists ended their suffering in the only way they could find: shooting themselves in the mouth, in the temples. The scene was indescribable. The anguish materialized in desperate suicides, a trace of the inability to accept that they had never existed.

The few scientists who survived remained silent for days, their eyes empty, their minds broken by what they had just discovered. The truth was unbearable.

Ultimately, the agency in charge of the investigation had no choice but to intervene. They were given new identities, new homes, new beginnings. They tried to reconstruct their lives, assigning them places and objects that ""fit"" the life they had supposedly had, no matter how impossible and expensive it might be.

It was a farce, a desperate attempt to return them to a normality that never existed. The Tt3 scientists knew that even if they were given everything they asked for, the void was still there. They had never been real.

The Tt3 universe vanished completely, like a forgotten dream upon awakening. The echo of his existence no longer resonated in the quantum flow.

Because of that structure in Chernobyl, which would one day be called ""The Wheel of Fortune,"" Tt3 became the universe that never was. A paradox condemned to repeat itself in the darkest corners of the multiverse, where reality itself fears to look it in the face.

Day 11: The Silent Wait

Agencies from other realities were beginning to show renewed interest. The mystery of the wheel was no longer just an isolated event in the history of Tt3. It now threatened all realities directly, like a growing shadow that stretched beyond its original universe.

The fear was palpable. Agency leaders were urgently exchanging messages, trying to understand the magnitude of the threat. However, something still didn't add up. The wheel, despite its power to undo Tt3's existence, did not seem to have the same effect in our reality. It was unknown why, but for some reason it did not affect our dimension in the same way.

The agencies reported that in the coming years they would conduct deeper investigations into the structure, and that they would collaborate with us to unravel this anomaly. It seemed to be a coordinated action between multiple realities, as if the entire multiverse were united by a common purpose. However, the tension was palpable in the communication, as if each word was infused with fear and distrust.

The mystery continued to grow. The questions piled up:
‚ÄîWhy doesn't it affect our reality in the same way?
‚ÄîWhat does the wheel mean for the fundamental laws of the multiverse?
‚ÄîWhat is happening at the intersection between realities?

Without clear answers, everything was left hanging in the air, waiting for the truth to slowly reveal itself. The agencies were now collaborating with each other, but the fear was still present. They knew they were facing something much larger than they had first imagined, an anomaly whose understanding could mean the destruction or salvation of all realities.

As the days passed, other realities also began to express their interest. More and more scientists and experts of dimensions we had never imagined were joining the conversation, but with each new revelation, the weight of uncertainty seemed to only increase. Each answer gave rise to more questions.

Now, everything had become a waiting game. We had no options, we had no control. We could only watch, ask and wait.

Time was lengthening, but the feeling that something even worse was coming did not disappear. We knew that the wheel was not just a physical artifact: it was a node, an intersection that connected realities in ways no one understood.

It was only a matter of time before the true nature of the wheel became apparent, and with it, the true threat it posed to the entire multiverse.

And as we waited, a growing terror brewed in the air, as if the emptiness of Tt3 had never left, but was waiting for the chance to return.

1jb8olq,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jb8olq/just_diagnosed_and_feeling_some_big_feelings/,"Just diagnosed and feeling some big feelings, could use some advice","Hi friends,

I‚Äôm 34 and was just diagnosed with ADHD yesterday, scoring highest on hyperactivity. I have anxiety and the plan is to address the ADHD symptoms and see if it helps with the anxiety.

The psychiatrist launched straight into meds and wants me to start TOMORROW. I‚Äôm having a hard time accepting that fast of a timeline. Honestly the thing that really got me, is she says I can‚Äôt drink coffee while starting meds because of the potential for 7x worse anxiety with the two. It sounds inconsequential and small, but I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm just going to have to change everything or will feel like a different person and even though the self criticism and anxiety is wearing me out, I‚Äôm scared to be a different person.

I‚Äôm sort of in a state of shock. I feel validated and I want to get med support but I just feel overwhelmed. 

I also have this urge to tell everyone in my life that I now have ADHD which seems self involved and silly. This just feels like a cataclysmic shift and I feel alone. I feel like I finally understand a little bit more about why things have gone the way they‚Äôve gone in my life and I‚Äôm trying to give myself more love. The whole point of me getting assessed was trying to do it as an act of self love.

Any advice about how to process and not feel like an imposter, and feel grounded in who I am, would be much appreciated.

1jb8oan,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HylianCrusader/comments/1jb8oan/everything_i_found_wrong_with_eww_rise_of_the/,Everything I found wrong with EWW Rise of the TMNT: The Movie,"I haven't done this in a long while, so I'm gonna start off with a lengthy introduction so I can establish where my allegiances lie.  
I, along with many of other people, grew up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. My first introduction to the franchise is a little murky, but it was either the 2003 series where I caught a small handful of episodes, or it was the 2012 series which was really good except that they did a terrible will they/won't they with Donatello, April, and later on Casey Jones. Needless to say, I have a bias to defend the TMNT, and a personal bias against liars, manipulators, and people I perceive to have ""betrayed"" me. For example, I used to love the Harry Potter books and movies with all my heart. However when I learned that Rowling was against the very idea of people changing their bodies to adapt to their current need, it felt as if I was ""betrayed"" by someone I admired.  
Anyways on to what you, the reader, came here for. I will link the video I will be sinning as well as timestamping and quoting the video to provide context. I do recommend also watching the movie, seeing that it is on Netflix.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiJOxnpt36o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiJOxnpt36o)

Sin 1, (0:13) ""Hey, movie, the length of your Nickelogo is more than adequate for the sinning, so there is no need to boldly flaunt SpongeBob's pineapple fob as he opens the lube valve at his weekly key party,"" I'm sorry, I don't understand what this means. How exactly is this a ""sin""? The logo is short, SpongeBob is (annoyingly) the mascot of the Nickelodeon brand, and I bet no one laughed at that terrible sexual joke.   
Sin 2, (0:20) ""Also, the presumed ecological effects of using slime as your primary comedy source,"" Jeremy, slime (as well as being gross) is part of Nickelodeon's branding. It's in the Kid's Choice Awards and the commercials. Also who cares about the FICTIONAL ecological effects of slime usage as a comedy source?   
Sin 3, (0:25) ""Looking down at your nostalgic picture instead of up at the active war zone you're running through, because IF YOU MAXIMIZE THE DRAMA YOU WILL MAKE IT BACK ALIVE!""   
Firstly, it's clear Casey Jr. is rescuing Leo from what I assume is a fight or something, since in the next scene Casey Jr. is holding him up, implying a loss of consciousness at some point. Secondly, LEO'S FAMILY IS (mostly) DEAD. You are doing the thing you do in most of your videos where you neglect the emotional impact in the scene, and instead override it with a dumb joke. Finally, this is part of a larger exchange with Casey Jr. where it ""tells"" the audience that something terrible happened, and now the world is caught in a massive apocalyptic fight.   
Sin 4, (0:35) (Future Leo: ""You're a lifesaver, Casey Jones,"") ""Who is this kid? Oh. Sh\*t. Am I missing an entire series that will explain important things? Listen, if you're willing to spend several minutes explaining the need for time travel you COULD have given me a quick catch-up on how we got HERE. Right?""  The movie just answered that question. This is Casey Jones, Jr, the son of Cassandra Jones in the ***Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*** TV series, which this is a series finale-esque installment to provide closure to the fans after Nickelodeon cancelled the series after sabotaging it. Also this is the opening sequence of the movie, they haven't explained the need for Time Travel yet, so be patient you child.   
Sin 5, (0:48) (Casey Jr.: ""I learned from the best."") ""Revealing your squishy face on a battlefield with projectiles that will maim and destroy squishy things.""   
Casey removed it so he could talk to Leo clearly. Besides, they weren't under fire at the time, so your point is rendered moot.   
Sin 6, (0:53) ""In case you confused it with 'You maniacs! You blew it up! Goddamn you! Goddamn you all to hell!'"" Not a sin.   
Sin 7, (1:06) (Future Leo: ""Impeccable timing, little brother. Very Dramatic"") ""And very convenient."" It is not convenient, Leo clearly expected Mikey to show up. If it were convenient, Leo and Casey Jr. would have reacted in surprise.   
Sin 8, (1:09) ""It's stranger but for some reason, he reminds me of a Doctor I know... Doctor Strange."" Most magical practitioners wear capes, cloaks, robes, or long swooshy clothes, such as Doctor Fate, Brother Voodoo, Wong, Scarlet Witch, Agatha Harkness, Wiccan, the aforementioned Doctor Strange, I could go on.   
Sin 9, (1:13) ""Putting your peace sign too close to your cloaca."" The sticker is on Mikey's shell, not on his skin. If anything, this sin is an excuse to say ""Cloaca"" since you find it so funny.   
Sin 10, (1:15) (Future Leo: ""That's it. The resistance failed. The Krang won. But... but it isn't over"") ""The Krang won, but it isn't over? What are the rules of this game? This is why you don't gamble with turtles."" This is actual war, not Balatro. What Future Leo is saying here is that they have lost the battle, but not yet the war. Also Kraang is spelled with two As. However since the subtitles for Netflix incorrectly spell it, I won't blame you.   
Sin 11, (1:25) (Future Leo: ""Mikey, we need a time gateway."") ""That is apparently just a thing that can be whipped up at a moment's notice."" No it can't. As it is shown later, Future Mikey sacrifices himself to open the wormhole. You even cut him off when he says, ""It'll take everything I have""   
Sin 12, (1:31) (Future Leo: ""The key that opened the doorway looked like this"") ""This convenient rock with conveniently pointy perfection that allows for precise drawing by three chunky loaf-bread-shaped digits."" This fictional movie... with humanoid turtle ~~mutants~~ Yokai... and you're uppity over a piece of charcoal.   
Sin 13, (1:39) (Future Leo, to Casey Jr: ""Mikey's about to send you back in time to the day that the key was stolen"") ""<sigh> They send him back to the day BEFORE the key was stolen, most of this movie doesn't happen and I get to take a nap."" I'm sorry, have you not heard of the Butterfly Effect? Casey Jr.'s mere presence changed the timeline so that Donnie and Mikey don't presumably die to the Kraang, and that Raph gets mind-controlled instead of murdered. If he was sent back 24-ish hours BEFORE that, any number of unpredictable nonsense could happen. Also, nobody except yourself is making you do this. If you want to stop, go find a new job.   
Sin 14, (1:48) (Future Leo: ""Find the key, stop the Kraang"") ""That's it. Those are Casey's only instructions for this WORLD saving mission before shifting into an emotional exchange about missing each other. How about, 'I remember the day it was stolen out of the art museum, start there, kid.'"" I don't know, I'd definitely be in a more emotional state given that there's a good chance Casey is never going to see Future Leo again.   
Sin 15, (2:01) (Casey: ""They found us!"") ""Given that you were hiding pretty much out in the open, I find your surprise to be surprising."" The Kraang are in large mech suits, If they stayed low enough they would be more likely to evade capture or death.   
Sin 16 (2:05) ""Mikey dies in this dazzling display of time-portal creation. It's a beautiful and cool sacrifice that the movie spends in the first five minutes without ever working to earn."" I call bullshit. This is the series finale that was meant to be the third season of the show before Nick cancelled it and cut the second season in half. Killing off a future version of one of the protagonists shows that this display of power is lethal, and renders Sin 11 pointless.   
Sin 17 (2:15) (Future Leo: ""When you're done saving the world, do me a favor. Grab a slice!"") ""And that is how the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles accidentally retconned their mythology and became known for their love of Orange Slice soda."" Firstly Casey is only going back in time to when the key was stolen, not when the Turtles were first created. Secondly, this does NOT retcon their mythology, since there are constantly new comics, shows, and iterations of the Turtles. If that were the case, they would be drinking soda instead of eating pizza since 2022, the release of this movie. Finally, Casey would probably ask Present-Day Leo what that meant since Future Leo bites the dust, leading to the ending of the movie.   
Sin 18 (2:25) (Casey: ""I made it?"") ""Thinking you've 'made it' in New York just because you still have your wallet after regaining consciousness in the middle of Time Square. Which is something that totally happened to a person that wasn't me."" He meant the trip, genius. Also nobody in the audience cares about what happened to you in Time Square.   
Sin 19 (2:35) ""Observe your hero, Casey, as he runs directly toward the Time Square bleachers. He will run up them, look around, and realize there's no way down, and then awkwardly walk back down them to carry on his mission like a dumbass."" Casey is a ninja. It's hilarious you'd think he'd walk back down after going up the stairs. That is, if he actually did. You slowed down the footage and told everyone what he was going to do, when what he actually did was run across the street over a manhole cover, which leads to the title drop and transitions to the rest of the Turtles.   
Sin 20 (2:47) (Leo: ""The whole world is counting on you... to break the pizza box stack record!"") ""This is... sadly... not a real thing."" FICTIONAL MOVIE. It doesn't have to be real to happen.   
Sin 21 (2:54) ""Wait there are actual pizzas in these boxes? F\*ck you guys for celebrating while pizzas are wasted and lives are about to be lost below due to a slice induced multi-laned car crash."" That's assuming the pizza will fall into oncoming traffic and not over the side of the bridge into the water.   
Sin 22 (3:05) (Donnie: ""Looks like we have a 317-39.4 in progress!"") ""They are rightfully confused. Where the f\*ck did this '2' come from? That's the joke. The other three aren't as smart as Donnie and don't have the patience or attention span to memorize all police reports.   
Sin 23 (3:13) ""We will see a lot of creativity over this hour and fifteen minutes of retina-blazing, seizure-inducing animation. A little bit of that could have been sprinkled on this generic-ass 'Artifacts Exhibit'. Well, what else would you have named a museum exhibit full of ancient artifacts?   
Sin 24 (3:13) (Hypnopotamus: ""We got the whatcha-ma-hoosie-doodle!"") ""Creating the best alternate name for a ""MacGuffin"" won't stop us from sinning it."" But why sin it then?   
Sin 25 (3:27) ""This is a lot of build-up just for Donnie to use his Green Lantern Powers to create a wall."" Yes, but it's to show that Donnie's powers are technology-based, which communicates the audience what Donnie's powers are. How are you a writer and don't know what ""Show, don't Tell"" is?   
Sin 26 (3:32) ""See, people, this is why you should never buy a baguette and just stick it in your grocery bag without having it wrapped in something else."" This isn't anything ""wrong"" with the movie. Besides, most baguettes are wrapped in plastic bags nowadays. I know because I bag groceries where I work. Sin 27 (3:37) ""Sinning a cartoon for characters surviving things like this is pretty ridiculous. But the whole story is designed around the idea that the Turtles die in the future so there has to be some rules governing physics in this situation, no?"" Hypno and Warren are shown flying out of the car, and they are Yokai. They'll be fine.   
Sin 28 (3:55) ""To be fair, the Foot Clan ""situation"" was there whether the key was kept, or lost, or dropped, or kicked, or pooped on. When the Foot Clan showed up, none of the turtles did sh\*t about it in any timeline."" Then you haven't seen the 2012 or the Rise of the TMNT shows then, because the Foot Clan in those series are BAD NEWS. For context, Shredder in the 2012 series fought the Turtles several times and bodied them, as well as hit Leo so hard he had to change voice actors, and that was just his human form! Later on he was mutated into Super Shredder, a hulking beast that actually killed Splinter.  
In Rise, the Shredder is a mystical suit of armor given to Oroku Saki (implied to be from the Kraang themselves) that transformed him into a juggernaut of evil that only was beaten by the combined might of the Turtles, Splinter, Cassandra Jones, April, and the spirits of the original Foot Clan.   
Sin 29 (4:02) ""Normally, you have to worry about bozos 24/7 because you have a chasm."" What? That doesn't make any sense.   
Sin 30 (4:17) ""Loving what they've done with the Master Splinter of my youth. Turning him from a wise, old racial stereotype into a comic relief racial stereotype."" This isn't YOUR Splinter though. This is MY Splinter. Also he isn't strictly comic relief. If you actually WATCHED THE SHOW, you'd probably like him as well.   
Sin 31 (4:24) (Splinter: ""Be the ninjas I taught you to be. Respectful... and quiet!"") ""When have they ever been either of these things? If that's what you taught these four to be, you have failed and should shamefully retire."" That's the thing though. This Splinter is a dad first, teacher second. Also you try getting four rowdy teens to can it.   
Sin 32 (4:38) ""What is this? Casey-Jones: Into the Bat-Verse?"" No, in the past two shows the Turtles used grappling hooks in their arsenal of ninja gear. How else are you supposed to get from rooftop to far-away rooftop or to get to high ground quickly?   
Sin 33 (4:41) ""See, it's funny because he's a NEEEEEEEEERD!"" No, it's funny because it's an absurd name. This is why you aren't a comedian.   
Sin 34 (4:48) ""Does April actually think she was close enough to reach the professor's ID tag? She is MILES away. Unless, of course, April was attempting desk yoga in which case she should take proper lessons because that modality of practice requires years of training and she clearly lacks the technique."" You are purposefully not showing that the ID tag is on his chair, which he is covering in-shot, and that her excuse to snag it was that she was going to take photos of him for the school newspaper.   
Sin 35 (5:01) (April: ""For years, this college shot down rumors that a foreign government is secretly paying them millions to develop a super toxic herbicidal deforestation bomb."") ""The deforestation 'bomb'? This seems pretty redundant given how well humans are doing on this front using conventional means."" It's a bomb to get rid of a large area of trees, fool.   
Sin 36 (5:17) (April: ""I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem"") ""My college girlfriend also blew the lid off Big Chem. And to clarify, for this joke, Big Chem was my roommate."" That is disgusting. Nobody wanted to hear how your ex gave a blowjob to your roommate.   
Sin 37 (5:20) ""April came in here looking for evidence, took a bunch of pictures that only prove the lab has vials, and left without even pondering what is in this file titled 'Secret'."" Yes, because she left before she could have gotten caught by Security. Besides, she earlier mentioned that there were rumors that they were developing toxic herbicide for a deforestation bomb. After swiping some of the vials, she has all the evidence she needs.   
Sin 38 (5:30) ""This three-point handing is some spidermens bullsh\*t."" You spelled Spider-Man wrong, and it's a common practice to balance yourself with a three-point landing. Sin 39 (5:36) ""In this universe there is INSANE tech available... and a phone can break from a 5-foot drop? Not just a little crack either, like... it falls with a case on and shatters as if it were hit by a train. This movie is going to do anything it wants, isn't it..."" So? What's the problem?   
Sin 40 (5:53) ""The moral of this story is, 'Do crime kids! But only when it's necessary to acquire the deus ex alchymia that you'll need later in the movie.'"" That's not a deus ex machina, that's a Chekhov's Gun. Get your tropes right you toddler.   
Sin 41 (6:03) ""Oh hey, Picture. Are your arms getting tired? Because you've been doing most of the heavy lifting for this story.""   
Sin 42 (6:07) ""Also, it sure is great for the plot of this movie that the investigative reporter, April, assumed this stranger that snuck out of the darkness with a photo of their group was a potential friend and not an assassin."" Yeah, it sure is great. Especially since if he WERE an assassin, he would have killed her on the spot instead of calling out to her. Oh, that isn't in the video? That's probably because YOU CUT THAT SCENE OUT YOU SCENE-MANIPULATIONG LIAR.   
Sin 43 (6:16) ""See this tiny speck on the ceiling? Yeah, that drops down to the table and magically turns into an interrogation light for maximum-intensity vibes. Forget understanding how high the roof must be to explain how microscopic it appears. Forget that it needs electricity to power it. WELL I CAN'T FORGET."" That isn't an interrogation light, that's a projector being used as an interrogation light. Also you can play with perspective in an animated medium. It's a stylistic choice.   
Sin 44 (6:30) (Casey: ""We ate leaves and rats. No offense."" Splinter: ""None taken, we are delicious."") ""Hahahahahahaha! This movie is funny. But, it's also stupid."" How is it stupid? You have to explain how it is stupid. EXPLAIN!!!   
Sin 45 (6:42) (Leo: ""I do like how he call's me Master"") ""The Confederacy's best argument against emancipation somehow makes it into the script."" I'm pretty sure the Confederacy's best argument against slavery was actually that if they got banned slavery, they wouldn't make as much money as they were.   
Sin 46 (6:49) ""You don't get to write off Aliens when you are hanging out with a group of mutant ninja turtles."" They can't hear you Jeremy.   
Sin 47 (6:57) (Splinter: ""The Kraang? I have heard that name."")""Of course, you have! The requirement for the following exposition story willed it to be so."" No, he heard of them through legend because they were worshipped by the Foot Clan.   
Sin 48 (7:08) ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Return of the Krang would have been a better name for this movie. So in its honor I will 'Roll Credits'."" No it wouldn't have. The reason why it's called Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie is because it's a continuation of the show because it was cancelled. Most animated movie shows follow the trend of  \[Name of show\] : The Movie when the movie is related to the show.  You sinned The Transformers: The Movie, did you not?   
Sin 49 (7:12) ""Considering this thing's hair has grown fully back since the previous scene, it shouldn't worry about money-making ideas. I mean, rob a bank for fun... sure. But figure out that insta-hair growth situation you have going on there and you will make BAJILLIONS."" That hair is a part of Warren Stone, a worm who can regenerate. If you want to have your hair back, go ahead and become part worm, Jeremy. You already have the brain of one.   
Sin 50 (7:32) ""There is surprisingly little blood from being chainsawed in the face. Casey, if you're not going to sharpen your blades, what's the point?"" Despite being an animated Netflix movie, it still is bound to the restraint of censorship and the artistic intent of the movie's makers.   
Sin 51 (7:39) ""Cover is great, but a little warning that you are about to be portaled wouldn't be so bad either. There IS a thing called portal consent."" No there isn't.   
Sin 52 (7:45) ""Also, Leo's placement of Casey's portal calls into question the choice not to send the entire GROUP on the platform, right? Like, why just send ONE person to the platform via portal when getting everyone up there makes more ass-kicking sense?"" Because everyone else is fighting Foot Soldiers to prevent them from protecting the key?   
Sin 53 (8:00) ""Deciding your villain would be a squid in the style of a purple stick of butter."" Sinning the Kraang. You are no TMNT fan.   
Sin 54 (8:08) ""'The heroes must lose their powers so they can regain them through the act of being a better person' cliche.' That isn't a cliche, that's a trope. Also they don't get them by becoming a better person, they get them because of their familial connection.   
Sin 55 (8:16) ""It really is lucky that this ancient alien species speaks perfect English and projects loud enough for other people to hear important plot lines."" Important plot lines? Bro, the Turtles already knew what they were going to do. Why do you think they're here trying to stop the Kraang?! Besides, Kraang 1 was talking to Kraang 3.   
Sin 56 (8:24) ""Donnie is just gonna be a walking ex machina, isn't he?"" NO HE IS NOT YOU DOPE. Donnie is the Smart Guy of the group. Also DEUS EX MACHINA ISN'T SAVING PEOPLE.   
Sin 57 (8:29) ""Yeah, Casey... why didn't you insist that there was an incredibly dangerous alien race trying to dominate the world that would kill everyone and take over at any cost? If only you would have done that a few minutes ago in the movie. If only you had inspired Splinter to remember ancient lore and reiterate how insanely dangerous a situation you would be in. If only anyone else in this scene would ALSO remember that happened. Is anyone paying attention? Are we just here for the updated art? WHY DID YOU MAKE ME WATCH THIS TERRIBLE MOVIE?!"" Wow... just... wow. First of all, he DID do that. Secondly, Leo wasn't taking any of this seriously until the Kraang skewered and captured Raph because Leo didn't listen. Finally did you just call this movie ""terrible""? I'm sorry, but I doubt anyone asked YOU to make this video. YOU are in control of what videos YOU make. YOU could have stopped at any time. It's YOUR fault you're barely paying attention to keep up with the movie. The only person that made you watch this movie was YOURSELF.  
Besides, we're lucky we got this movie. The only reason it exists is because Nickelodeon cheated the crew that made the show out of what they were promised, which was 3 seasons, which was whittled down to 2, which was then cut in half.   
Sin 58 (8:53) ""Oh, come on! You can't pull this sh\*t in the Back to the Future epoch. It's all multiverses, parallel times, and whatever the hell Tenet was about."" Leo is clearly emotionally lashing out because he got Raph captured.   
Sin 59 (9:04) ""Movie briefly pretends like these two goals aren't pretty closely aligned and that the third act won't prove this to have been the case all along."" But saving Raph would take time, time they currently do not have because of the ALIEN APOCALYPSE.   
Sin 60 (9:10) (Donnie: ""Shouldn't we talk about this before we run off all half-cocked, willy-nilly, pell-mell?"") ""Half-cocked, willy-nilly, pell-mell."" Sinning Donatello for being Donatello.   
Sin 61 (9:21) (Leo: ""They made it about me when they took my brother."") ""They made it about YOU when they took HIM? The f\*ck?"" Yes, they did. Have you never heard of ""nobody messes with my brother except me""? Keep up old man.   
Sin 62 (9:28) ""So you're saying that you were wasting our time and could have just read his mind and gotten this over with?"" Oh my GODDDDDD, how are you not picking up that the movie is not outright saying the tropes like most other movies? This is the ""We can do this the easy way or the hard way"" bit. Sin 63 (9:40) (Mikey: ""The Turtle Tank, baby! It's how we roll in the past. I mean, the present. I mean... Ugh! Time travel's confusing."") ""You didn't time travel at all, Mikey. It's talking that is confusing for you."" That's what he meant.   
Sin 64 (9:47) ""But, luckily I was conveniently interrupted because it will be much more dramatic when I say it later."" Except that it wasn't convenient, it was INconvenient.   
Sin 65 (9:57) ""But did you try a combo of the mystic jelly in the secret hole while spanking it?"" If all of those things didn't work, why would they work together?   
Sin 66 (10:00) ""Is there no other important information to display on these screens? What does <<!>> do for anyone? How about telling us the temperature outside, the underground humidity, or the remaining power available on the generator that is powering your underground layer? At the very least you could ease my mind and give us readings on the stability of the f\*ing 'black hole toaster' just hanging down here, hm?"" Oh screw you, you would have sinned that no matter what. Anyways the <<!>> obviously means DANGER!   
Sin 67 (10:21) ""Mikey thinks that being exposed and HARD would be a better option."" Donatello in this series is a Spiny Softshell Turtle. They physically have soft shells, which leaves them more vulnerable to attack.   
Sin 68 (10:25) ""Did the non-existent camera operator have to shake the hell out of this non-existent camera?""   
No. Sin 69 (10:32) (Kraang 2: ""Run, insects, but you can't escape!"") ""You mean 'won't escape.' Come on, Krang Two. If you're gonna keep it up like this, you're always gonna be singing back-up."" No, she meant ""can't escape."" ""Won't"" is a contraction for ""will not"", while ""can't"" is a contraction of ""can not."" ""Will not"" is implying a promise while ""can not"" implies inevitability. I grew up a pedantic Grammar Nazi, so I can do this all day.   
Sin 70 (10:36) ""This visual metaphor about the struggle to stretch this TV episode to feature length."" That's not a visual metaphor, that's a joke, and I don't want to go on another rant.   
Sin 71 (10:43) ""The random vials that April stole from the lab turn out to be a bunch of chekhovenient deus ex bullsh\*t."" This has to be the most heinous and infuriating misuse of ""convenient"" and ""deus ex machina,"" I've ever seen in my life, and I watch you via Th3Birdman.   
Sin 72 (10:51) ""Celebrating, when you should be terrified that you've been walking around all day with fragile vials of this potion just jingle jangling all around in your backpack."" Firstly this is par for the course for April. In the show, she's always been characterized as a well-meaning adrenaline junkie that loves to kick ass and chew bubblegum. Secondly, that isn't a potion. That's super toxic herbicide. April said so earlier in the movie.   
Sin 73 (11:03) ""That is a very odd way to say 'Thank shell you have a plan because all my knowledge and powers are useless at this point.' No, Splinter is genuinely scared of April in this scene.   
Sin 74 (11:10) ""Seems like they have cut the scene where April and Splinter stole the Bat-Pod right out from under Batman's nose when he popped into the local Starbucks to grab a 'triple, venti, half sweet, non-fat, caramel macchiato.'"" Firstly, thinking Batman drinks Starbucks. He has Alfred on speed-dial to both call the adoption guy and to have the coffee brewer ready. Secondly, The Dark Knight Trilogy doesn't count as Batman. He does no detective work, he kills his villains, and he isn't mentally scarred from childhood. Finally, That's not the Bat-Pod. That's one of two detachable motorcycles that are usually on the Turtle Tank.   
Sin 75 (11:19) ""Ok. I can't handle it anymore. These four chin whiskers are INSANE. I mean, can we fill it in a little? <marker squeaking> No. Nope. Let's just get rid of it. (proceeds to erase all of Casey's face) Ah, that's better."" This fool hates Casey Jones.   
Sin 76 (11:32) ""Did the animators need to give this tall veiny building a nutsack?"" That's...  not a nutsack. Sin 77 (11:35) ""This dumbass has no harness."" That ""dumbass"" is presumably Bishop, a resident badass in TMNT mythos and member of the US Government that heads his own Earth defense force. He doesn't need a harness is what I'm saying.   
Sin 78 (11:38) ""This vial of liquid plant-death went from villain to hero so fast that I'm beginning to wonder if this film was bankrolled by Monsanto."" You mean Bayer.   
Sin 79 (11:45) (Leo: ""Can you tell me if he's still in the building?"") ""He can. Instantly. And he can pinpoint a location. Instantly. Which entirely erases his inability to pinpoint Leo and Casey twelve f\*cking seconds ago. THAT'S THE JOKE. For the ""comedy"" channel you claim to be, you really can't tell when something is a joke.   
Sin 80 (11:58) ""Nobody evacuates their cloaca in this scene."" That's disgusting. Also another excuse to say cloaca.   
Sin 81 (12:04) ""Wait a second! April and Splinter actually brought the key to THE TOWER OF F\*CKING DOOM? Sure, they saved Donnie and Mikey, but have they not heard about the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few?""   
Sin 82 (12:16) ""They could do that the WHOLE time? They could poof out... the WHOLE time? Come on, Splinter... why not use that ability in the first fight? Does anyone realize this is the END of the WORLD? Honestly? I'm okay with everyone dying at this point and the movie just becoming an episode of Keeping up with the Krangdashians."" No. No they can not. The smoke bomb is to provide cover so they can sneak away.   
Sin 83 (12:30) ""Gratuitous Krang crotch shot."" That's not their crotch.   
Sin 84 (12:32) ""And now we've got a sky beam portal thing, like we haven't seen one of those before."" So? As long as it isn't overdone, it's okay to use.   
Sin 85 (12:35) ""In the name of all that is Roland Emmerich. Is this thing really going to dissolve into disaster porn? Gah!"" You know you can turn of Netflix, right?. You don't HAVE to watch this movie.   
Sin 86 (12:40) ""All of this seems to be happening pretty quickly, right? The goopy tentacles make the portal pad which calls the goober eye that subsequently launches evil shapes out to wreak havoc on the city. They're aliens, though, so... the speed of evolution is understandable somehow. ON the flipside, however, I do NOT believe that the military has a full-blown attack ready in response this quickly. Locals with guns? Sure... Tanks? Nah."" Clearly you haven't seen how trigger happy America is then. If all the countries of the world were dog breeds, we would be the rabid raccoon.   
Sin 87 (13:06) (Casey: ""Guys, it's time to face facts. We can't change the future."") ""Glad we've taken this aside to discuss whether or not the plot of this movie is possible. But, was it really necessary considering in about 20 seconds you'll all just agree it is?"" What's this ""we"" business? You aren't in the movie, none of the characters in the movie can hear you, so sit down, shut up, and watch the movie before I shove you into the nearest trash can.   
Sin 88 (13:16) (Leo: ""Donnie, what do those big beautiful eyebrows have to say?"") ""Well, now that you've drawn my attention to them... how the F\*CK does this TURTLE have EYEBROWS on a MASK? They shouldn't be saying anything, they should be MASKED."" I got two answers for you. The Watsonian reason is that Donnie uses a marker to draw them on all his masks, and for the Doylist explanation... IT'S A CARTOON YOU DUMBASS.   
Sin 89 (13:33) (Leo: That big jerk may be covered in goo and half alien, but he's still our brother, and I'm not giving up on him."") ""The unfortunate reality we all must confront when one of our siblings goes through puberty."" Last I checked, my siblings aren't half alien and covered in goo.   
Sin 90 (13:37) (Splinter: ""This psycho routine is a little thin. Where's the character development?"") ""Splinter would be excellent at CinemaSins"" Yeah, he'd realize you all are scam artists and steal your bones.   
Sin 91 (13:43) ""Well, they've gone full Locutus of Borg with this Raph's been assimilated story arc. Which is cool but it will only ever be Number One to something original. And by Number One I mean second in command, so actually number two. Just go watch Star Trek instead of this. You'll have more fun and you'll get my jokes."" Why should I? I don't have to listen to you or your terrible pop-culture reference and sexual implication heavy ""jokes"". You aren't funny, you don't provide enough clarity on what you like or dislike about the movie, and you don't provide examples on what the movie COULD do to make it better. You aren't a criticism channel, you aren't a comedy channel, you are a nothing burger.   
Sin 92 (14:00) (Kraang 1: ""I am saving this weak planet! I am a gift!"") ""Me explaining what I do for work somehow makes it into the script."" Jeremy is a Kraang... somehow this makes too much sense.   
Sin 93 (14:07) ""Whatever is happening to Donnie's soft shell is f\*ckin' gross, and ripped off from The Matrix. But, mostly it's f\*ckin' gross."" Inspired by, not ripped off.   
Sin 94 (14:18) ""Yep. Our hero kept his consciousness while merging with the dominating alien tech. Some people get to keep their personalities, some don't. Does it make sense? No."" It does make sense. Donnie is controlling the Technodrome's systems, but Raph is brainwashed by the Kraang. You either don't care or just aren't paying attention. Either way, your reputation is liver toast.   
Sin 95 (14:26) ""This giant eye could use a little more explaining. Like, where did he come from? Where did he go? Where did he come from giant-eyed Krang monster?"" I'm going to ignore the awful attempt at singing to point out that this is the Technodrome, and that almost every iteration of them each has an enormous eye somewhere in their design.

[OG Technodrome ](https://preview.redd.it/owhwcgr6qooe1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=073749f2ba88e7763514447a6854433c4f3df797)

Sin 96 (14:38) ""Thank you for coming back more Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles than you were before. But, Krang is not like your Mom at soccer practice. There is no need to try and impress them."" IMPRESS THEM? BITCH THEY'RE TRYING TO STOP THE KRAANG FROM CONQUERING THE EARTH!   
Sin 97 (14:46) ""Also, Leo, you don't what gender that purple stick of butter is."" Seeing that earlier it referred to Kraang 2 as ""Sister"" and Kraang 3 ""Brother"", Kraang 1 identifies as ""male"".   
Sin 98 (14:52) (Kraang 1: It's pointless to resist Kraang!"") ""Some might say it's futile."" These are not the Borg.   
Sin 99 (14:53) ""Earlier one of the aliens brought about by the Krang turned a train into a monster. But now, suddenly the powerful being is stopped by a heavy metal ball?"" That's because the Kraang by themselves are squishy but strong, and their technology can ""mutate"" objects and turn them into Kraang hybrids.   
Sin 100 (15:01) ""I decided to perform the blink test at this point and over the 20 seconds of time I saw 16 different image shifts. SIXTEEN."" Is the blink test real? No. But it is now and that is all that matters."" Then tell me, what is ""The Blink Test""?   
Sin 101 (15:11) (<all together> ""KAA-ZOOM!"") ""When did ""Ka-zoom"" become a thing? they've said ""mystic"" like, 13 times but this is the first ""Ka-zoom"" and they're acting like they do this sh\*t all the time."" So this sin REALLY pisses me off. Having watched the show several times (did I mention this is one of my favorite iterations of the Turtles?) they are not at all saying ""Ka-zoom!"", but they are saying ""HOT SOUP!"", which is the catch-phrase for famous martial arts actor Lou Jitsu, the stage name for Hamato Yoshi, AKA Splinter (Yes, this is a parody of Jackie Chan.) However YOU got it wrong, and instead of doing any form of research, you decided to double down on your mistake and in your subtitles had it say ""Ka-zoom"".   
Sin 102 (15:22) (Raph: ""Leo's still up there."") ""You don't know that. How could they know that? How are they confident about ANYTHING happening anymore?"" Simple. Kraang 1 knocked Donnie and Mikey off the Technodrome, and Leo told Raph to go rescue them.   
Sin 103 (15:28) (Leo: ""When I get to the other side, you close that door."") ""I see he is really is keen on doing this hero's sacrifice thing. Which is an empty threat considering no one would believe that this move has the meatballs to kill off Leonardo and tank the merchandise sales in the last ten minutes of the movie."" Firstly, Leo's entire character arc was becoming selfless and to think of others. Secondly, Nick and Paramount not getting them good merchandise is ONE OF THE REASONS THIS MOVIE WAS MADE. They screwed up so bad that when people started angrily messaging them on Social Media, they allowed the team that made the show to work with Netflix to make a movie that basically condensed all the ideas they had for the Kraang that they would have used later on if they weren't cancelled.   
Sin 104 (15:40) ""The Krang dude is absolutely just letting this conversation happen right now."" So? Who gives a shit? What matters is the emotional knife twisting last message Leo is giving to his family.   
Sin 105 (15:50) (Kraang 1: ""Weak words, weak actions. I have forever known what you fail to understand. Strength always prevails!"") ""Sure, when it decides to finish the job instead of wasting time expositing about how it's stronger than everyone."" What YOU fail to understand is that Kraang 1 has Leo dead to rights. He has the opportunity to let his meal writhe in fear, much like a cat does to rats and mice.   
Sin 106 (16:10) (Leo: ""What you fail to understand is I missed on purpose."") ""Cool, but Krangis Kahn still has plenty of time to kill you. You got lucky that he just didn't. So stop acting like your plan is going off without a hitch."" This was BADASS and how dare you for sinning it. Also, Kraang 1 didn't kill Leo because he was toying with him. It was thanks to Kraang 1's hubris and Leo's teleporting powers that saved the planet.   
Sin 107 (16:18) ""Hesitating when you know the stakes."" Jeremy is a heartless bastard.   
Sin 108 (16:21) ""The bat sh\*t physics that are allowing Leo to hold back the Kraang despite them both just floating about in space. Is this swimming? What the f\*ck?"" Space still confounds CinemaSins.   
Sin 109 (16:33) (Raph: ""Mikey, whatever you're doing... don't stop."") ""This is VERY unhelpful advice, considering this power has no clear rules and could easily be a portal to a potty, or a pizza parlor, or a Portal Potty Pizza Parlor! Patent pending."" But it DOES have clear rules, you just weren't paying attention. 1. Mikey must focus on a place, time, or person to open the portal. 2. It would most likely kill Mikey in the process of making said portal.   
Sin 110 (16:43) (Raph: ""We're here, Mikey, Together."") ""And it's a good thing we recently watched Guardians of the Galaxy. Otherwise, how would we know we are in a ""we're stronger together"" cliche? Undercutting YET ANOTHER powerful emotional moment with a dumbass joke. You must be really great with kids!   
Sin 111 (16:52) ""I think the movie wants us to believe this message is about the Turtles, but none of the above text exchanges has a turtle in the imagery so... who the f\*ck are the heroes we're talking about here?"" Daredevil, obvi-OF COURSE IT'S THE TURTLES!!! WHO FUCKING ELSE HAS BLUE, RED, PURPLE, AND ORANGE COLOR SCHEMES?!   
Sin 112 (17:01) ""Movie tries to pull this sh\*t when it was sh\*ting on Staten Island like ten seconds ago. You can f\*ck right off with your performative pandering to the screen."") He was talking to Casey, not the audience.   
Sin 113 (17:13) ""Pulling someone's f\*cking tail! What the hell, April?!"" Splinter will get over it.   
Sin 114 (17:15) (Casey: That's my mom!"") ""Oh, great! Casey's a nepo baby too."" No, he's just Zelda Williams' son.   
Sin 115 (17:23) (Donnie: ""There goes the space-time continuum"") ""Happy to report it should be fine as long as he doesn't f\*ck her."" That's nasty. You're nasty.   
Sin 116 (17:28) (Raph: ""You know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?"") ""The challenge of hiding the portal key that leads to a horrible earth-dominating dimension in a place no one would ever find it? Oh, are we just forgetting about that HIGHLY important piece of the puzzle?"" No, he's rising up to the challenge of having fun with his family.

If you made it here, congratulations! It's the end of the post. I do recommend watching both the show Rise of the TMNT and it's movie (movie after the show), because the entire show is great. Anyways I hope you have a great day, that you stay safe, and that you keep fighting for what you believe in. Bye!",1,1741971473.0,u_HylianCrusader,0,1.0,False

After Donald's arrival, the nightmare intensifies, and the manipulation and physical violence begins. The anecdote that I am going to tell today was told to me by Carmen. 


Chapter 2: Of blow, blood and alcohol


He is a man of average height, around 1m75, smoking like a fireman and with a slight drinking problem. It was some time later that he moved into our little house in the heart of the countryside. Here I am again with a family, a mom, a dad and a house. I'm grown up now, enough to walk and be able to roam around the house without help. 
On a beautiful spring day, Donald's niece, whose name I didn't remember, came to show off her new car that she got after getting her license. An aprero was obviously offered, ros√©, ricard, and Kir. 
After a little while around the table, the whole small group went out to see the said car...leaving me, a 2 year old child, alone in the house. Curious, I would approach the coffee table and empty the rest of the glasses of alcohol. All, without exception. 
After a good half hour of talking about cars and mechanics, the group of adults came back towards the house, finding me in the doorway, drunk, dying of laughter and staggering. 
If I told them, they would have laughed at my apparently more than amusing state: a 2 year old child, dead drunk. 
From what I know, they didn't see fit to take me to the hospital, but I had the right to be reassured all the same. From Carmen‚Äôs words: 
""For 3 days I didn't sleep, every hour I came to see if you were breathing, I was so scared you know. You didn't sleep much at the time, but here you were sleeping 11 hours!"" 

I would be so inclined to answer that I am not sure that this sentence fits with: ‚Äúoh we had a good laugh seeing you there‚Äù. But hey.

Moreover, a few years ago, curious, I asked said niece what she remembers of that day. She then grew pale before telling me: 
""When we arrived, you were strange, you were laughing for no reason and you were having absenses, almost like someone very tired. And when you drank the drinks, I was very scared, you know I was studying to become a nurse, and you hadn't drunk much but it was strong alcohol... But I think I was even more scared when I saw him slap you so hard that you fell because you had finished his drink of Ricard. I thought he had killed you...I even think you bled. Your mom was really scared at the time, she took you to your room and said that if your condition worsened she would take you to the hospital, and keep me informed... I admit that, shocked and with my fatigue from studies, I didn't ask for any further news....""  


So, after these two testimonies, I have the right to ask myself who is telling the truth. And then, was I already drunk before? Or was I drugged with the said sedatives from the first chapter? 
The only thing I am certain of is that leaving a young child alone, and especially under the (possible) effects of medication is absolutely not reasonable.

And you ? What do you say about it?

We're making our way through the Avetts' 2024 self-titled LP The Avett Brothers with a poll every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

The rules are simple: vote for whichever song you think should be **eliminated** and the last song standing wins.

\-----

***The Avett Brothers (2024)***

1. ~~Never Apart (w/ Vocal Prelude)~~
2. ~~Love Of A Girl~~
3. Cheap Coffee
4. ~~Forever Now~~
5. ~~Country Kid~~
6. ~~Orion's Belt~~
7. 2020 Regret
8. ~~Same Broken Bones~~
9. We Are Loved

\----------

In the sixth round ""Love of a Girl"" was eliminated with 41% of the votes.

The Avetts have been releasing music for nearly a quarter century. Across two dozen releases (LPs, EPs, single, special-editions, and live albums) they've never written and recorded a song quite like ""Love of a Girl"".

They've had plenty of adrenaline-infused heart-pounding tracks and barnburners, but this song is a one-of-one in their catalogue. Heavily inspired by their punk roots (with some clear-as-daylight Jack White influence) this song feels as fast as the iTunes samples of yesteryear. Its biggest departure from their previous work is the rapid fire back-and-forth of their vocals. Scott and Seth share plenty of songs but never as co-mingled as this one.

It's fun! It's energetic! It's certainly not their deepest/poetic piece of art but it's 100% a breath of easy-breezy fresh air after their previous heavy introspective albums.

\----------

1jb8j2n,https://i.redd.it/aa9s84sgqooe1.jpeg,Just finished Week 4 and feeling so optimistic!,"Yikes, this turned into a long read, my apologies if you don‚Äôt make it all the way! I understand! :) And I appreciate all of you!

I‚Äôm so glad u/No_Persimmon7818 posted today asking for positive experiences because I have been planning to post a Week 4 update for a few days after seeing some less than stellar comments coming in.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, SW 183, CW 170, GW 135(ish). 
That means I am down 13 pounds in 4 weeks!! I was hoping to see that scale dip down into the 160s but I have to remind myself that this is a not a sprint! But it‚Äôs also not a marathon with the help of the shot. ;)

I just took a Zofran and then took my fifth shot a few minutes ago. My prescription is .2<.4<.75<1.25. After several communications with the care team, it has been confirmed that I am on a personalized dosage, not commercial. I chose to continue using my first vial for my fifth shot and will continue to use vials past their 4 week mark unless they look cloudy or have been exposed to higher temperatures for a period of time. I read some people saying that 1.13 is the highest dosage from Hers but I have been prescribed something higher than that.

I want to thank everyone in this sub for all of their transparency! I find myself checking in here a few times a day just to see what others are saying and going through. It truly has helped me feel not so alone in this process. Unlike some of you, I have been telling pretty much everyone in my life that I am taking the shot. I have posted before that I am a restaurant manager and if anyone has worked in restaurants before, they know that me being on weight loss injections is the least dramatic thing currently happening in our restaurant. ;)

I have experienced some side effects and am wondering what titrating up today is going to do to my energy level, constipation and the brain fog that happens when I reach my low energy threshold tonight (after closing the restaurant and getting home at 2am!), since I do experience that the day I take my shot and sometimes the day after. I almost always take a second Zofran the day after my shot to combat a little bit of nausea. I drink Metamucil every morning and follow it up with a Liquid IV and coffee to combat the constipation. I am using Cronometer as my calorie and water counter and highly recommend it because, for free, you can manipulate the amount of macros you want to eat everyday and it is very easy for me to see when I have eaten 100g of protein. I also drink at least 96oz of water a day and I can see that clearly on Cronometer.

As far as food goes, my diet is very simple. I don‚Äôt get bored of the food being the same now that the food noise is gone. Protein shakes, I like Premiere protein, cottage cheese, 4oz of chicken breast (I make my own and use a food scale to cut the breasts into 4 oz), Greek yogurt, protein bars, deli turkey, carrots and celery, hard boiled eggs and that‚Äôs about it. I found some Greek yogurt salad dressings from Bolthouse Farms that are only 50 calories for 2 Tbsp and I still put a dollop of Miracle Whip (IYKYK) in my tuna salad or on a turkey wrap with Carb Balance wraps. I love to smother the chicken breasts in Franks and make buffalo chicken wraps as well. I find I struggle to eat 1200-1400 calories on most days. I focus on making sure I get to at least 100g of protein each day and when all else fails, a 200 calorie protein bar always seems to work for me on those days I struggle to get enough calories.

The hardest part, and the reason I think I did not see that number in the 160s is because a big part of my life as a restaurant manager is going out for dinner and drinks with my friends and colleagues, who are almost all also in the service industry. Every uptick on my 1 month progress chart was after a night at a work event spent drinking and nibbling on food that is not part of the diet I am preparing at home. I think it‚Äôs important to remember that we still need to be ourselves. One of the things I have always hated about dieting is that anxiety that if I stray from my diet, that it! Game over! But with the shot, every day feels like it can be day one again because the food noise is just not there!

These are my positives from this shot so far:

-reduced food noise. This tends to get a bit louder by days six and seven but was especially bad during Week 4 and I knew it was time to titrate up.
-reduced noise in my head, period. I‚Äôve found I have been kinder to myself and haven‚Äôt gotten down on myself since I‚Äôm not eating too many fries at work and I have more time to finish projects at home when I‚Äôm not so stressed out about how much I am eating or drinking.
-reduced desire to drink alcohol. This is a big one for me. There are always opportunities to go out for me. Some are required for my job. I find when I do, I drink much less and much slower because my body triggers that it is full. Reducing my head noise has also reduced my desire to drink, so it‚Äôs a win/win for my mental health.
-weight loss. I am seeing and feeling the results!! 

Please remember semaglutide works differently for everyone and from what I have read, some people not at all. If you aren‚Äôt seeing results, reconsider your diet and exercise. I am going to start incorporating strength and toning this month. I have a lululemon Mirror and really love being able to work out from home with my hectic schedule. We are all different! I can‚Äôt tell you what will work best for you, but I am happy to share my experience on what I believe is an absolute miracle in my struggle with weight loss. I have been overweight since my early 20s and haven‚Äôt seen the 130s since I was 19. I am so excited to see where this journey leads me in the coming year! Everyone here should be incredibly proud of themselves for taking the step to try something new, something that can be used as a tool to achieve a goal. For me, it was the risk of gestational diabetes when my husband and I start trying to have kids in the next couple of years. I don‚Äôt want a high risk pregnancy for me or for my baby. Especially not in the state I live in. I knew I needed something to help me jump start my weight loss at this time in my life and GLP-1 has been my tool.

1jb8hqz,https://i.redd.it/xxojz037qooe1.jpeg,Canadian espresso machine,"Going down the rabbit hole of choices of espresso machines after mine broke,  I stumbled on a special going on at Canadian Tire for the Paderno espresso machine 20 bar with milk frother for 249$ instead of 299$. I thought to myself, Paderno can't be Canadian right? Well it is! 

It had very few reviews online but I decided to give it a chance and I'm so glad I did! And why not try to put the word out there that's it's a really good machine! I've worked at a second cup for a couple years when studying so I've used commercial espresso machines. 

My first at home machine was the Utlima Cosa I found for 89$ on special a few years ago and decided it couldn't hurt to try it out. I will say for a cheap one it worked okay but had a touch screen that often steam would get into and mess with the bottons (like turning off the machine while using it) and was a bit hard to properly clean. I never knew I had to descale the machine and it clogged up recently. It was no point saving it as after descaling it still wouldn't properly work.

About a month ago I saw De'Longhi 15 bar espresso machine was on special and decided to get myself one. I was quite disappointed in the performance of the machine. It barely gave me any crema, more like a regular coffee and I hated the milk frother. Just wasn't for me. Returned it and waited for the refund and started looking into a different kind. 

Just got the Paderno yesterday, had a few lattes and cappuccino and it's amazing! Super smooth to use, it is powerful enough to pour a good shot of espresso with crema and the milk frother is long and rotates really far away. The material is strong, especially the portafilter is robust and has weight to it, as well as the tamper. 

It is beginner friendly as you can just set the frother into the milk jug, set the jug down on the drip tray and let it steam for a simple latte, comes with a funnel to help pour your beans in the portafilter. It is very easy to use with a clear manual guide. It also makes good cappuccino once you get used to the frother. It is very quick to heat up/start up and not too noisy. Comes with a 2 year warranty and all the accessories. 

All in all, for the price, it has significantly improved the overall experience when making my espressos! I would give it a 8.5 out of 10 as it does have a plastic exterior but still looks pretty nice and I'm still figuring out the double shot. I also just bought myself some Matteo's coffee syrups to flavor my espressos (again, a Canadian company) when I usually would buy Torani. I'm excited to try those for the first time!

**Outline:**

I'm shooting for a 48-72 hour fast once per week. I'll probably just repeat the formula from this time since it seemed to be rather painless: the day before fasting begins I'll glycogen deplete by only having one high fat/zero carb meal, midday, that is <500 calories. Probably some kind of keto latte and a salad again. Then I'll fast, and break the fast with a brothy soup followed by yogurt and salads. In terms of lifestyle, I'm going to continue spring cleaning my house, and then throw myself into some other In terms of lifestyle time consuming project soon after completing this one.

I joined a sorority, I liked my sorority. I made tons of friends. my friend group was about 8 girls, and to this day it still is those 8 girls.

but i can‚Äôt help but stand every time im with one of them, they talk about the others. they also say such mean things about their looks even though everyone is really pretty.

anyways I just feel like now I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I genuinely don‚Äôt like these people except for one of them. I‚Äôm in nursing school and I have so many sweet and funny nursing friends who I spend a lot of time with studying and coffee dates. The lives are different though, with these friends we actually inspire each other and grow with each other, and I guess my sorority friends are more my ‚Äúfun‚Äù drinking friends.  

so, after dealing with them taking about me behind my back, my relationship of 3 years saying awful things about it and trying to sabotage it, along with never supporting my nursing journey and saying the reason I ‚Äúnever go out is because of her boyfriend‚Äù, im just done. they‚Äôre all so mean. 

so it‚Äôs like, now what, I could stay and be fake just like they‚Äôre all doing, or protect my peace and not have as much ‚Äúfun‚Äù like going to bars with a big group of people.

It just sucks because we all grew 3 years together in college. and now I feel like a loser for actually removing myself partly from the group. I just respond less and don‚Äôt go out much. 

but now I‚Äôm feeling kinda weird about it. so is it better to just be fake? stick through it?

We have been dating for about 6 months. My partner is a very cheery and bubbly person, all of the time. They have ADHD and essentially never run out of energy and are also relentlessly positive. I am pretty depressed right now largely due to a situation outside of my control. I don't want to give any revealing information but essentially I've worked really hard for something and now just have to sit and wait to see if anything will come of it. I'm in a prolonged waiting period that has me feeling antsy and irritable (it's not indefinite, it'll be over by the end of the month but has gone on a couple months now). The political situation also has the odds looking worse and worse for me, so I've spent the last month anxious asf. My partner is in a similar situation and yet is still constantly cheery and trying to cheer me up, and I feel mean because it just annoys me. For example, I hate waking up and never wake up rested. I just want to drink my coffee in silence, but they immediately start being incredibly affectionate and touchy and cutesy and telling me about 500 ideas they have,  talking about hypothetical plans that are many years into the future and depend on a million uncertainties, etc. and it just makes me feel worse. If I don't react positively they ask if I'm mad at them, I say no I'm just tired and am not feeling like talking rn, but nothing changes. Even if they aren't talking I just FEEL all their energy pointed at me and they're like practically vibrating with excitement and happiness to see me/be with me, and it's so overwhelming for me. I feel like an asshole for not being able to enjoy their positivity. I'm glad they can be positive, but I just can't take the pressure to reciprocate or engage in it when I'm feeling low. 

For context, we go on dates regularly where I'm able to put my issues aside and enjoy the date or activity. I just can't do that all the time. I've even felt like I should break up with them because I can't match their positivity and am afraid of hurting them. But they assure me they are ok and feel loved by me. I just can't stop being annoyed. Idk if I'm just misplacing all my negative feelings onto them or what. I think it's also because I can tell they are trying really hard to make me happy and it makes me feel like I'm being pressured to act happy when I'm not, or maybe like they don't really love me as I am. I feel like I've told them all this multiple times but they're just like, don't worry I don't mind, I love you as you are, you make me happy, etc. but that doesn't really address the issue that I just feel annoyed by them and it makes me want to avoid them. But surely I am an asshole if I just tell them they're annoying me. I feel stuck and don't know what to do. Do I communicate my annoyance? See them less often? Just get over myself?

1jb8cdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jb8cdb/aio_if_i_cut_of_contract/,AIO if I cut of contract,"I‚Äôm going to apologize in advance for my terrible grammar and hope it‚Äôs still understandable. 

This story requires context. So just over 10 years ago my aunt (38 at the time) met a man (45 at the time). I was 15 almost 16. I‚Äôve always had a large chest (36DDD), and everyone always commented on it, like middle aged coworkers at a kitchen I worked at at the time called me ‚Äútits‚Äù as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù. I digress, I‚Äôd learn early to ignore the comments as much as possible. 

Anyways, we were very close with my aunt and cousins, we always spent as much time with them as possible cause they were the same age as me and my brother. 

The first time I met this man he said ‚Äúyou must be *** cause you have huge tits‚Äù I was baffled I just shrugged it off and said yea because I had no idea what to say. My immediate family was kinda surprised too but I think we were all so caught off guard, nobody said anything. 

This kept going though, he would casually throw it into conversation every so often when we saw him (wasn‚Äôt too often as they were in the honeymoon phase of dating). My aunt shrugged this off as ‚Äúoh we talk like that at home too, he says stuff like that about my girls‚Äù. Mind you my family if very body conscious so they do make comments about each other, it‚Äôs not a process I enjoy or take part in. But I guess she allowed him to take part in this. 

Fast forward a few months, at their wedding. I‚Äôll admit I got a little carried away, I drank a little too much and was past my limit. I ended up crawling on the floor because I was too drunk. As I was crawling through their house I saw him standing there with no shirt so I made a comment about him not wearing a shirt because I remember feeling gross about it. He came back with a ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre not wearing a bra‚Äù which I was, so I said ‚Äúyes I am!‚Äù and he said something along the lines of ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äù Eventually we went back to our hotel because they needed to put me to bed. 

The next morning is where things unfolded because we were outside on the deck having coffee when he brought up the fact that I wasn‚Äôt wearing a bra the night before, at this point my father had had enough. He didn‚Äôt want to ruin this relationship for my mom and for us kids, because we were very close but enough was enough. He started yelling at him saying things like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough already, there‚Äôs no need for you to be talking about her body all the time she‚Äôs 16‚Äù. When this was poorly received, they thought my father was overreacting, we left immediately. 

They ended up getting divorced 3 years ago. 

Fast forward to recently, I have been more recently (last 2 years) in touch with one of my cousins. We were on a trip and drinking a bit one night. I don‚Äôt know how the topic was brought up but essentially she blames me for being drunk and ‚Äúnot wearing a bra‚Äù which I was, saying that I took it too far and basically caused all these issues between our family. My partner, who I believe has a firmer grip on reality, stated that I was young and it was good I had someone to stand up for me. This set my cousin off and she firmly states she knows the whole story because she saw how drunk I was. Mind you she wasn‚Äôt in the vicinity the day after when the ‚Äúfight‚Äù, if you can even call it that, happened. But she‚Äôs still firm on the fact that this is all my doing.

This is honestly something that‚Äôs making me question maintaining contact. Trying to explain that this was a series of events and not an isolated incident was impossible. And it‚Äôs not even just this that‚Äôs pushing me, it‚Äôs the constant need to villainize me. Like recently I was feeling pretty bad about myself (bloated form period), I was expressing to my partner how gross I felt, and my cousin twisted it and said I was basically calling her fat and unattractive because she‚Äôs heavier than me (we‚Äôre both overweight). Please tell me if I‚Äôm making a bigger deal than I need to about this.

Tdlr. My temporary (uncle in law?) had been making comments about my body since I met him at 15/16. Til eventually my dad had enough and yelled at him. My cousin blames me for being drunk. ",2,1741970632.0,AmIOverreacting,16,1.0,False

Instant coffee usually contains less caffeine than regular brewed coffee. For many, coffee is an essential part of the day. It provides a much-needed energy boost. Understanding the caffeine content in instant coffee can help manage your daily intake. Different brands and types of instant coffee vary in caffeine levels.

Some might have more caffeine, while others less. Knowing the exact amount helps you make informed choices. Whether you‚Äôre cutting down on caffeine or just curious,¬†[learning about instant coffee‚Äôs caffeine content is beneficial](https://gomehedi.com/best-instant-coffee/). This blog will explore the caffeine levels in instant coffee and what you need to know.

# Caffeine Basics

Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in various foods and drinks. Understanding its basics can help you make informed choices about your caffeine intake. This is especially important if you enjoy instant coffee, which is a convenient and popular way to consume caffeine. But how much caffeine does it actually contain? Let‚Äôs delve into the basics of caffeine to find out.

# What Is Caffeine?

Caffeine is a natural chemical found in coffee beans, tea leaves, and cacao pods. It acts as a stimulant to the central nervous system, helping you feel more awake and alert. Here are some key points about caffeine:

* Chemical name: 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine
* Found in over 60 plant species
* Commonly used in beverages like coffee, tea, and energy drinks
* Average half-life in the body: 3-5 hours

Caffeine works by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep. As a result, it helps to increase the levels of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. These chemicals improve mood, focus, and alertness.

While moderate caffeine intake is generally safe for most people, excessive consumption can lead to side effects such as:

* Insomnia
* Jitters
* Increased heart rate
* Stomach upset

It‚Äôs important to monitor your caffeine intake to avoid these potential side effects. Knowing how much caffeine is in your favorite drinks, like instant coffee, can help you manage your consumption better.

# Sources Of Caffeine

Caffeine can be found in a variety of foods and drinks. Here are some common sources:

|Source|Average Caffeine Content|
|:-|:-|
|Instant Coffee (1 cup)|30-90 mg|
|Brewed Coffee (1 cup)|70-140 mg|
|Tea (1 cup)|20-60 mg|
|Energy Drinks (1 can)|80-200 mg|
|Dark Chocolate (1 oz)|12 mg|

Instant coffee is a popular and convenient way to get your caffeine fix. Its caffeine content can vary depending on the brand and preparation method. On average, a cup of instant coffee contains between 30 to 90 mg of caffeine.

Other sources of caffeine include:

* Soda
* Over-the-counter medications
* Some dietary supplements

Tea is another common source, with black tea containing more caffeine than green or white tea. Energy drinks are also popular, but their high caffeine content means they should be consumed in moderation.

Understanding the sources of caffeine can help you manage your intake. This knowledge is especially useful if you enjoy multiple caffeinated products throughout the day.

# Instant Coffee Overview

Instant coffee is a popular choice for many coffee lovers due to its convenience and ease of preparation. But how much caffeine does it contain? To understand this, let‚Äôs take a closer look at what instant coffee is and how it is made.

# What Is Instant Coffee?

Instant coffee, also known as soluble coffee, is a type of coffee that is made from brewed coffee beans. It is processed into a dry form that can be quickly rehydrated with hot water. This makes it a convenient option for those who are short on time but still want to enjoy a cup of coffee.

Here are some key points about instant coffee:

* **Convenience:**¬†Instant coffee is easy to prepare; just add hot water.
* **Storage:**¬†It has a long shelf life and doesn‚Äôt require refrigeration.
* **Variety:**¬†Available in various flavors and strengths.

Instant coffee typically contains less caffeine than regular brewed coffee. On average, a cup of instant coffee has about¬†**30-90 milligrams**¬†of caffeine, whereas a cup of brewed coffee can contain¬†**70-140 milligrams**. This¬†[makes instant coffee a suitable option](https://gomehedi.com/best-instant-coffee-brands/)¬†for those who prefer a milder caffeine intake.",1,1741970476.0,u_johnsmithmath89,0,1.0,False
1jb8a7m,https://i.redd.it/xvv0xyskoooe1.png,"""Before it's coffee, it's a fruit‚Ä¶ and not all of them taste the same""","
One thing that still amazes me as a coffee farmer is that coffee cherries don‚Äôt all taste the same across varieties. Before roasting, coffee is a fruit, and depending on the variety, some cherries are super sweet, like mango or lychee, while others are more acidic, like green plum or passion fruit. And then there‚Äôs Eugenioides, which is so sweet it barely tastes like coffee.

And this isn‚Äôt just a fun fact‚Ä¶ the flavor of the cherry actually affects the final cup. The sweeter the fruit, the more fruit-forward the coffee can be. During fermentation, the bean absorbs some of those compounds and transforms them into flavors you‚Äôll eventually taste in your cup.

Another interesting thing in the field: if I plant two coffee trees of the same age, one Geisha and one Bourbon Rosado, they grow differently‚Äîdifferent leaves, different branches‚Ä¶ and their cherries taste different too. Geisha, for example, has a spicy, bell pepper-like note in the cherry, something you wouldn‚Äôt expect in coffee.

So next time you taste a coffee with fruity notes, remember‚Äîit‚Äôs not just the roasting process‚Ä¶ it was already in the fruit from the beginning.

Has anyone ever tried a coffee cherry before it‚Äôs processed? What did it taste like to you?

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the dating culture here. It's...interesting, to say the least. One day you're the center of their universe, and the next, you're, well, not.

As a self-proclaimed nerd and overthinker (yeah, I know, it's a work in progress), I've had my fair share of dating disasters. No labels, no commitment, just a whole lot of ""go with the flow"" (cue eye-roll).

So, if you're looking for someone who's down for old-school dating, minus the games and drama, let's grab coffee (or a book, I'm not picky). Bonus points if you can handle a fat, nerdy, overthinking mess like me.

Hi parents!

I wanted to start a thread for anyone looking for **daycare fundraising ideas** to help cover costs for things like craft supplies, new toys, outdoor play equipment, or special activities. If you‚Äôve ever found yourself thinking, *‚ÄúHow are we going to pay for all this?‚Äù*, you're not alone!

üëÄ **Before you read, drop your favorite daycare fundraiser in the comments!**

Like a car wash, but for strollers! Offer to clean up those crusty cupholders and sticky seats for a donation.

**23. Family Fun Night**  
Host a potluck or pizza night at daycare with games and crafts, charging a small entry fee to cover costs and raise extra funds.

This would be kind of further into the story than I've explored so far, and it's not set in stone of course. But I was thinking it might be interesting if Bea were to die before breaking the pact she made with the Clown Father. Her body doesn't stay dead for long, but when it comes back to life it wouldn't be her anymore, it would be Basma, the Clown sorceress who was trapped within Bea during her conversion into being a Clown. Basma might then go on to assume leadership of the Clown temple in the City of Juno, probably by force using Bea's powerful body and her own mastery of magic. Of this move would be concerning to Bea's friends who knew her as someone who fell away from the church and regretted the pact she made with The Clown Father. 

But what happened to Bea herself when she died? The pact every clown makes with The Clown Father is clear on that, their souls are consumed and spend eternity within Him, living out their afterlife in a sunless, eternal carnival, naturally called the Dark Carnival. Bea grew to intensely dislike all things clowny in life, so this afterlife is an actual hell for her. 

The Dark Carnival is a very chaotic place, at first glance it looks like a colorful sprawling city infested by circus tents, massive advertisements for amusement park attractions, and other sideshow nonsense. It's inhabitants always scrambling manically from place to place, spraying each other with seltzer water or bashing bystanders with oversized mallets, but nothing really seems to matter, no one sustains any injuries or complains about being drenched in fizzy water. It's all just par for the course. Carnival music blares ceaselessly from speakers at every street corner, egging on the nonstop frenzy, overall it's a sensory nightmare. 

Bea herself would be attending a support group for clowns who regret the pact they made and who are not fans of the afterlife they are now subjected to. They meet in a room that would probably resemble a stuffy office from the 90s, lit with harsh florescent lights, complete worn office carpeting and water damaged ceiling tiles. The support group is an oasis of normalicy in an ocean of chaos, the burned coffee and stale donuts are a welcome change from the cotton candy and corn dogs that make up the staple foods outside these four walls. 

Perhaps Bea finds work as a garbage person, no one needs to work in the Dark Carnival, but it helps pass the time. The only silver lining for her here is sort of strange, she finds that without her living body holding her back, her training and meditation grows her power exponentially greater, maybe without the pact shackling her Ki she can finally tap into the oceans of reserves that were hiding within her. Perhaps that's the key to her escape?

Any other owners? I am looking for advice for dialling in.

Firstly, I am on a budget - so my set up is very basic right now.

I have an aldi espresso machine - the basic one. I have upgraded to a bottomless portafilter. Thats the only change so far.

I am on grinding on the E55 at 45. This seems to produce nice fine coffee but I was expecting to need to grind down at like 15 or 10..?

Second, if I grind any more than 12-13g I am struggling to fit it all in the portafilter. It tamps down ok but the initial ""getting it in"" is a problem. I guess I will need to invest in the proper tools...

Third problem is if I grind any finer than 40 then my machine cant get through the puck and it just clicks off.

Anyway, I am not exactly sure what I am asking.... but anyone also use this grinder? Cheers!",1,1741969916.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Years ago, a co-worker and I hooked up at a christmas party, after, they stated that they weren‚Äôt the best with relationships but would like to keep a fwb situation going, as someone who wasn‚Äôt fond of commitments at the time, a chronic overthinker and would also get anxious over the unknown, I happily agreed to keep things strictly beneficial between us. 

She was definitely my type of person, we shared similar interests and she was a little weird and quirky which I liked, she kept a christmas tree up right by the front door year round just because. We would smoke, watch tv shows and have amazing sex for a year, but once I realized a full year had passed I became overly concerned with the possible aspect of a committed relationship and broke it off. 

At this time we were at different jobs but loosely kept in touch through snapchat, but a few months later I would find myself back at her place, picking up where we left off. I had convinced myself to stay within the fwb mindset, because I knew the break off bothered her, but when she asked about it I simply told her that it was a ‚Äòme issue‚Äô but never elaborated any more than that. So we kept it up for about another year and had our last hookup a month before covid hit.

I really started to mess things up soon after when I noticed an abnormal bump during lockdown, I informed her about it and got tested, but even after the results came back negative, my dumbass still challenged her trust and questioned her more, even to the point of asking if she was with other people during our hookups and possibly passed something to me. I know, I was clearly twisted up mentally and in the wrong but by the time I had realized that, I felt that the damage had been done. 

I believed that she wouldn‚Äôt want to be with me romantically but I still desired at least a civil relationship as I realized that I had strong feelings for her that I just kept pushing away from anxiety and fear. I messaged her several different times throughout the following couple of years, apologizing and hoping to get a coffee or some lunch together, but never expressed my true feelings. 

Although she possibly never even wanted to evolve our relationship to something more serious, I definitely feel that one of my biggest regrets in life not attempting to take things more serious and not telling her how I felt. I hope the girl with the year round christmas tree is doing well and is finding all that she seeks in life.

For context, Seo Dal-mi is the CEO of Samsan Tech in the Korean drama¬†*Start-Up*. She is ambitious, bright, and dreams of starting her own company to become Korea's Steve Jobs.  
  
Going back to me, I‚Äôm a 26-year-old software engineer from Northern Luzon. I‚Äôm a tech expert with a wide range of tech stacks, including both front-end and back-end development, SQL, AI, and cloud technologies (Azure and GCP). I've been dreaming of starting my own company since I was 18 years old.  
  
Before and during the pandemic, I joined numerous hackathons, with or without a teammate. I've participated in six hackathons and won second place in two of them. I pitched ideas related to agriculture and education-ideas that I genuinely believed could make a difference. I really, really love pitching my ideas and showing others how the world could look if these concepts were to exist. But I struggle with figuring out how to grow these ideas using just my own skills, knowledge, and experience.  
  
I also started a small clothing business. I designed t-shirts and had a small budget to work with, but I wasn‚Äôt consistent. I sucked at marketing and selling back then, even though I knew how to use Facebook Ads. Fortunately, I still managed to sell out all my clothes and made a small profit, but I never reinvested it to grow the business. I eventually had to close it down when I started working full-time on-site in Makati, and there was no one in my family capable of taking it over.  
  
Up until now, I‚Äôve been building a new idea, currently working on the foundational design to validate it with my target customers. However, as I‚Äôm building it, I often wonder if there‚Äôs someone else out there thinking and dreaming the same way I do. How big are their dreams? What problems are they trying to solve? What are their skills? Do they have marketing expertise? Do they know how to use Figma, pitch ideas, and think strategically?  
  
I always wonder if I will ever meet someone like Seo Dal-mi, not necessarily a woman, but someone of any gender who shares the same dreams and ambitions. Someone who could even surpass the things I can do while working toward the same goal.  
  
People always say,¬†""Join business expos,""¬†or¬†""Go where connections can be made.""¬†I mean, I could still network and invite people for coffee to talk about my business ideas, but is that really enough?  
  
How? Where? When? Who? I just don‚Äôt know. Maybe I‚Äôll figure it out eventually and still succeed in bringing my ideas to life. But it would probably feel different if I met someone whose dreams aligned with mine.  
  
Additionally, another fact about me is that I‚Äôm never afraid of talking to influential people, those with industry connections, aged 40 to 60+, wearing strict formal suits. In fact, I even enjoy talking to them, especially when the topic is about something I‚Äôm passionate about, haha. I don‚Äôt know why, but a lot of people I know are intimidated by them. But for me, I don‚Äôt feel nervous or fear being looked down upon.  
  
Probably because I always tell myself,¬†*""Why should I be afraid of this man when someday I will eventually surpass him?‚Äù*

That rule was drilled into me on day one.¬†*‚ÄúLeave at sunset. Never stay out after nightfall.‚Äù*¬†But that day‚Äî*that*¬†day‚Äîsomething pulled me in. A child‚Äôs voice, echoing from the forest‚Äôs depths‚Ä¶ Not laughter, but a fractured cry, closer to a sob. Maybe a lynx. Or wind rattling the trees. I fed myself rational explanations, but my legs dragged me toward the sound anyway.

My name is Emir. I work as a seasonal ranger in the Black Pine Reserve. It‚Äôs labeled a ‚Äúprotected biodiversity zone‚Äù on maps, but locals call it the¬†**Echo Forest**. When I first arrived, I asked an old man at the gas station about the name. He stubbed out his cigarette and said,¬†*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt chase the voices, son. You‚Äôll hear what it wants you to hear.‚Äù*

Now, as I trudged deeper into the woods, a nagging detail clawed at me: There were no birds. Not a single chirp. I‚Äôd logged¬†*‚ÄúRich avian activity‚Äù*¬†in my morning report. But all I heard now was the crunch of dead leaves under my boots and‚Ä¶ breathing. Not mine. Something close, like a presence hovering just behind my shoulder.

The voice came again. Clearer this time. A child‚Äôs scream:¬†*‚ÄúHelp me!‚Äù*¬†I ran. My old knee injury flared, but I didn‚Äôt stop. When I finally stumbled into a dry creek bed, I saw it: a small figure curled at the base of a pine tree, back turned to me. A red jacket, smeared with mud.

‚ÄúHey! Are you hurt?‚Äù I called. No response. As I crept closer, I realized the jacket wasn‚Äôt red. It was¬†*white*‚Äîstained with something wet and glistening.

The child turned.

It had no face.

I returned to my cabin past midnight. My boots caked in mud, hands trembling. As I bolted the door, my phone lit up: 22 new messages. All sent by¬†**me**.

**‚ÄúGET OUT NOW.‚Äù**  
**‚ÄúCAN YOU HEAR ME?‚Äù**  
**‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS REPLICATING.‚Äù**

The timestamps read three days ahead. I hurled the phone against the wall. The cracked screen reflected my face back at me. But my reflection was smiling.

Morning brought false normalcy. Sunlight pooled on the cabin‚Äôs wooden floor; the coffee pot hissed cheerfully. Then the radio crackled to life.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶warning‚Ä¶forest‚Ä¶escape‚Ä¶‚Äù*

I flipped open my logbook. The entries for the past 48 hours read:

*‚ÄúOct 12: Routine patrol. No anomalies. Note: GPS malfunctioning, weak signal.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúOct 13: Child‚Äôs corpse found near creek. Facial deformity. Failed to notify authorities (comms down). Body gone.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúOct 14: Comms offline. Food supplies low. Attempting exit.‚Äù*

Today was October 11th.

I slammed the logbook shut. The ink on my fingers was still wet.

By noon, I found it: the red jacket snagged on a broken branch. When I touched it, images exploded behind my eyes‚Äî

*A man. Older, but with my face. Running. Footsteps behind him‚Äîtoo many to count. A scream like splintering wood. Then‚Äî*

I dropped the jacket. My palm was smeared with crimson. Not blood. Something amber-thick, reeking of burnt hair.

Nightfall broke the rules. I stepped outside. My flashlight beam carved shadows into monsters as I walked. Every ten steps, I glanced back. Something was watching.¬†*Hungry.*

The creek bed had changed. The water had vanished, replaced by thousands of white stones. Each the size of a human tooth. When I picked one up, a voice hummed inside:

*‚ÄúYou found me.‚Äù*

The stones began to clatter.¬†*Click-clack-click.*¬†A rhythm. A heartbeat. I ran. My boot caught a root, and I fell. The flashlight died. In the dark, I felt damp breath against my cheek.

I woke in my cabin at dawn. Clean clothes on my body, hair soaked. A note on the counter:

*‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT LEAVE.‚Äù*

The handwriting was mine.

Days blurred. The radio looped the same phrase:¬†*‚ÄúEchoes never die.‚Äù*¬†My food ran out, but I felt no hunger. Just‚Ä¶ fullness. As if something inside me was growing.

One night, I stared into the mirror. Small white stones nested in my hair. My teeth wobbled. When I pulled one free, there was no pain, no blood. Under my bed, I‚Äôd started a collection: 32 teeth, 17 fingernails, 2 glass eyes‚Ä¶

Finally, I understood. The forest wasn‚Äôt hungry. It was¬†*lonely*. It fed on our echoes‚Äîour fears, memories, darkest thoughts‚Äîall festering here, rotting into new shapes.

The night I burned the cabin, I saw them in the flames: faces writhing in the bark, handprints in the soil. And far off, a small figure in a red jacket, dragging itself toward the creek‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm writing this now. Maybe someone will find it. But listen: If you ever hear a child‚Äôs voice here,¬†**don‚Äôt answer**. Because the echo will wear your voice. And once the forest claims something real, it never lets go.

1. Quadruple check that you've packed everything the day before.
2. Leave early.  Before 9AM.  Before 7-8 AM, if you don't have crippling ADD like me.
3. Plan your route so that you can pass through major metro areas before rush hour.
4. Items to have: A water bottle + a long USB phone charger cable for your car
5. Google Maps time estimates are optimistic.  It assumes you're speeding, there's zero traffic or lane closures.  Add 25% longer as a buffer + an hour or 2 for rest stops/gas.
6. Pack healthy food (i.e. protein bars/shakes, nuts, etc).  Living off of fast food for days on end wears you down fast.
7. Unless you need gas, rest stops are always better than exits.  Because they're on the way, whereas exits add 15-30 mins to your route and lead you into traffic jams.  I would visit a rest stop to stretch my legs for 5 minutes, even if I don't need to, so that I can avoid having to do so at an exit.
8. If you do take exits for food/gas, take them in less populated areas.  I'd fill up at 50% in a rural area if it means not having to fill up in a dense city.
9. Fast food can work sometimes, but pick items on the menu with protein and/or veggies.  i.e. the egg sandwich instead of the donuts.  The veggie delight at subway, etc.  (If you're vegetarian or gluten free, probably worth the time to stop at the grocery store during your trip.
10. I drink coffee at noon.  Too early = crash sooner.  Too late = insomnia.
11. Download Podcasts.  I like Two Hot Takes.  Make sure you delete ones you've seen already.  I think it's worth spending the time the night before each drive to curate your list so its easy to play what you want.",41,1741969380.0,roadtrip,39,0.89,False

FYI, a really long story is coming, years worth of it. I tried to put timestamps as much as I could to make it as easy to read as possible.

This ""feud"" or drama is between my friend (35M), let's call him Josh, and my mom (51F), and I am kind of in the middle (29F).

First, this drama is not still going on actively in my life, I just wanted to share this mostly to get it off my chest, and if I get some advice from this awesome community, even the better, most of it emotional as it has been consuming me, but maybe actual legal help as a bonus, so I think it's important to say that we are Portuguese (Portugal, Europe), so if any Portuguese lawyers are here, your input is mostly appreciated! Also, English is not my native language,¬†so there may be some grammatical errors, go easy on me please!

A little bit of background story: Josh and I have been friends since I was 13, super, super tight friends from the beginning. He has always had a difficult life and a difficult family; he is the oldest of 7 (now sadly 5, as he lost his two youngest siblings), and he dropped out of school and started working at 15 to help support his family. Seriously, life has not been easy on him, although that would not justify everything that will happen. But me being a privileged spoiled brat, I always had a lot of respect for him and everything he did for his family and friends. Josh was a little bit older than everyone from our group and was always paying for things (we were all 13/14/15 with no jobs) or giving us a place to crash on his couch if we needed. We all were literally like family; we all spent every weekend together. He bought me my first drink; he hugged me through my first heartbreak. I was abroad when his youngest brother passed away, and it broke my heart that I could not be there for him.

As it always happens when you grow up, people move to different places or different stages in life; our group got smaller, but we never lost touch, getting together every two weeks and on important moments.

Until 2018, when problems started. My maternal grandparents's apartment caught fire (everyone was okay, the awesome firemen arrived in 10 minutes, and only one room was badly damaged). My grandparents are extremely poor and did not have home insurance, and they were going to be basically homeless and lose the home they had for 50 years, so what we decided as a family was that since my mom is a single child and the apartment will be inherited by me and my brother someday, we would pay for the renovation, and we decided to renovate the entire apartment, which never saw any improvements in those 50 years.

My brother had money saved up because he is the cheapest person I have ever known (10‚Ç¨ for a t-shirt will send him on a rant), and I am the exact opposite. But we both had a trust fund from our paternal grandfather (this will be relevant later), but we could not access it until we turned 25 without losing the interest rate on it (I was 23 at the time and my brother was 20). My brother put up his own money, but I had to talk to my grandfather. He was the sweetest, and he loaned me the money himself so I would not lose the interest on the trust fund, and when I turned 25, I would just pay him back.

I immediately thought of Josh for the renovation work, as he was starting out his own construction company, and he hadn't had the chance to do big projects yet. Now looking back, I can see that a very old Portuguese saying, ""Friends are friends, but money is on the side"" (original: ""amigos, amigos, dinheiro √† parte""), is so true for MANY, MANY reasons.

Problems started when he presented the renovation budget to us. It was not detailed at all (e.g., bathroom‚Äî5,000‚Ç¨), and I sat down with him and told him that I wanted a breakdown of things (how much was he budgeting for the floor? for the pipes? for the sink? etc.), and he did take it defensively, as he had never done an actual proper budget before, nor a project this big. The next version was much better, even if a detail-oriented person like myself would have liked more details, and we accepted it.

A lot of things went wrong during the remodeling: things were never on time, but that wasn't too bad as we were expecting it, but still annoying, as Josh's time frame for the renovation was 2 to 3 months, and it ended up being 7 months. When the apartment was close to finished, Josh let himself into the apartment to show it to future clients of his without consulting anyone from my family. What was bad was when Josh started making decisions for me and my brother (the colors of the paint or the tile or the cabinets), and we actually got a shade of wood for the kitchen cabinets that we did not choose. Josh's words: ""They didn't have the one you wanted, so I just chose the closest one."" During the renovation, when we had to wait for other suppliers, Josh would take other jobs in between (which is perfectly normal) but then did not have time to dedicate to our apartment when things were ready because he was already overworked. And then we started to go over budget without me really understanding why. Josh's argument was that the materials my brother and I chose were more expensive than what he had initially budgeted for, so it was our fault anyways. Now, here is where it started to get under my skin: the lack of organization. There were no receipts, no tracking of expenses, or labor hours from Josh's company. Here in Portugal, it is extremely common to do construction work illegally, so not submitting to the IRS, as that would have cost us 30% more in tax. This leads to this kind of problem: if the company doesn't have to submit expenses, then they technically don't have to keep track of anything.

When we got into arguments about what Josh was spending our money on, there was no way to prove either of us right or wrong, as there were no receipts or expense tracking. At this time, my brother and I were living in cities a little bit far away, so my mom mostly dealt with Josh on a daily basis.

So my mom. My mom was a stay-at-home mom when we were growing up, and after the empty nest, she dedicated herself to DIY and gardening to occupy herself. She is a great mom, with one HUGE flaw that has caused problems over and over again: she is the biggest people pleaser I have ever met, to her own detriment and our family's. Something my brother and I have talked a lot about, and in therapy too. I was an artistic roller skater growing up, and from the ages of 8 to 13, I had this coach that would verbally abuse me (sometimes small physical abuses as well, like pinching my back or slapping my arms) and basically degraded and humiliated me at every chance she had. My mom was present at every practice, every slur or insult, and never did anything. When I was 13, at a national competition, my dad witnessed it, and he lost it in front of 300 people. That was the first time that anyone had ever stood up for me, and also the first time it clicked in my head that it was not okay. I switched coaches soon after that and took it upon myself to dictate that part of my life, not my mom. And only as an adult, after therapy, did I realize that even as a kid I never counted on my mom to help me or support me, only my dad. My mom and I did address this recently, and she apologized and took ownership of her own mistakes, and we cried and hugged, but two weeks later, we were meeting a distant relative of ours to introduce my baby boy (he is turning 1Y now and is the cutest little thing), and as a greeting to me, my great-aunt said, ""You are so fat, how did you manage to do that?"" and my mom spoke for me to say, ""Oh, she just hasn't lost the baby weight yet"" and laughed. I was floored. Not only did I not gain baby weight (I actually had so much heartburn and acid reflux during my pregnancy that I lost weight), but also I do not see me being a 29Y mother with a little bit of extra weight as something that needs defending. My mom just could not handle that I would tell the old hag to f\*\*\* off and cause a scene (she could see in my face that that was where I was headed), so she tried to defuse the situation by insulting me as well.

I just understood that that side of her was really a lost cause, the only thing I told her was she had no right to speak for me and let me defend myself, since she never would.

Sorry for the long tangent; it was to paint a good picture of how my mom is.

So during the renovation, she was the one handling most of the things with Josh, and I did get the idea that a lot of things that went wrong were because my mom did not want to argue with him, so she just said yes to everything. Including taking leftover materials. Josh renovated his own apartment floor with what was left of my grandparents' and painted as well with the paints that were left. That rubbed me the wrong way. But again, not proof because of no receipts, bad budgeting, and bad control of my mom of things.

After the renovation was done, 10,000‚Ç¨ over budget, I sat down with Josh to discuss everything that went wrong. I started by saying that he did a great job because we love that apartment and that I did not think he did anything maliciously (I could not prove it, so I was not going to accuse him of anything). But that has his friend, I had advice for him. He needed to get his shit together. He needed to hire someone to help him manage things and overlook budgets because all the mess could have been avoided with planning and organization. And Josh really needed to stop mixing his clients money: on any job, he would ask for 50% of the budget upfront, managing it poorly and going over budget, and then take a new client, using that client's 50% to cover for the old client's gap until they paid up. This created a never-ending cycle of mess.

Josh got angry with me, saying he knew what he was doing, and everything that happened was out of my family's decisions. I never said we handled it well either, and there was definitely a bad communication from our side, but he never took any responsibility for his part. We parted ways and did not talk for two years, and I lost touch with most of my friends because of it, as it was my decision to step away.

Two years later, summer of 2020 if I not mistaken, Josh called me, inviting me for a coffee to talk everything out, and we patched this up. I am not a hateful or resentful person, and I missed him in my life, and I honestly thought he was a great person that did bring a lot of good to my life. Things never did get back to the way they were, but a solid good friendship was still there.

Josh's life was really improving; business was growing well and solid relationship with his now wife, but during this time a lot of things about Josh solidified for me: he did not know what to do with money. He bought a new house, a luxury car, and a new business in his hometown for his family to manage. He would just splurge daily going out to dinner and on clothes. I think that growing up without any money, he just didn't have any impulse control, and it didn't help that he did not separate his business's money from his own. And he just spent it all as soon as he got it.

In the meantime I turned 25 and received my trust fund, and I called my grandfather to pay him back and get his details for the transfer. And he said he wanted me to gift that money to my mom. My mom doesn't have anything to her name, all she has is what my dad has or gives her, and this could either be a safety net for her or a help to start something for herself. I was more than happy with that, and that was exactly what we did.

My mom and Josh had also built a friendship of their own, and in November of 2022, she told me that Josh was going to do the remodeling of my parents' house roof. Even though things were good between me and Josh, I did give my mom my opinion that I did not think that she should trust him with another big project like that, given what happened. My dad and brother agreed with me, but my mom still went ahead because it was a lot of work to find someone else and she did not trust other people either, preferring to give money to a friend over a stranger.

Money problems occurred again. Josh was always asking for advancements on payments, and it came to a point where he asked for just 1000‚Ç¨ inadvance to pay his workers because he didn't even have that saved up in his business. It was clear that he still had the same management problems as always. I made it a point to keep myself away from it this time, and from the outside it looked like the end of it. Josh did another good job that went over budget again, and that was it.

June of 2023, 2 of his brothers were in prison, his daughter is about to be born after years of trying and Josh's mom passed away (seriously, life has not been easy on him). I spent 2 days by his side, together with some of our friends, just supporting him and being there for him and his family. It did bring a lot of nostalgia, all of us being together again. My mom made an appearance for the funeral, and nothing struck me odd about it.

Josh's baby daughter was born in August 2023, and I was 3 months pregnant with my baby boy at that time. Things were really good for a while, and we were happy to share this stage of our lives, raising our kids almost side by side. Then in October of 2023, he called me out of the blue to check up on me and my pregnancy (we usually just texted to meet up; calls are not really our thing), and when the call ended, I thought it was weird, but okay, just a friend checking up on me. 30 min later he texts me, ""Sorry I chickened out, and by text it's easier. Things are really tight, and I was wondering if you could let me borrow ‚Ç¨1000. I have a deal coming through next week and will pay you back when I cash it."" I did have the money; luckily, I am very well off, but I did not feel comfortable with the situation at all. I was in the process of buying a new apartment, preparing for my baby, and even though I could have lent him the money, I just didn't trust him with it after everything that had happened. I told Josh I would not lend him the money, but if he needed anything for himself or the baby, send me a grocery list as big as he wanted, and I would shop for him. Josh said he needed the money for his business, not personally. I reiterated that I would not give him money for his business, but if he or his daughter ever were missing anything, to just ring me up. He took it well, apologized for the whole thing, and we moved on.

I immediately called my mom to warn her that he was probably going to ask her next, and she was weird about it but thanked me for the heads-up. Two days later I checked up on Josh to see how things were; he told me he worked it out and all was good now.

This brings us to December 23rd of 2023. 6 months pregnant at the time, I was at my parents and my mom asked me to take a look at her MacBook that was not connecting to Wi-Fi. I restarted the PC, and the Messages app opened up (my mom was not aware, I think, that the messages from iPhone and Mac sync up), and I see messages between her and Josh. There were like 20 messages from my mom, going back MONTHS, asking Josh to pay her back, most unanswered and ignored by Josh. The blood drained from my face. My mom asked what was wrong, and I made up some excuse and just left. I know I should have just talked to her right then and there, but I just could not process everything that I was feeling, and was always controlling my blood pressure because of a high chance to develop pre-eclampsia, so I just avoided all stressful situations in general. The holidays were passed with me avoiding being alone with my mom and this weird vibe that told me that she knew that I knew.

In the beginning of January 2024, I was dog-sitting for my parents while they were traveling, and I breached her privacy and logged into her PC to take a look at all of the messages. It was so much worse than what I had imagined in my head.

So here is the timeline of events that I was able to gather from the texts:

Feb of 2023 (a year before almost) Josh called her to ask for money, 10,000‚Ç¨, to pay some suppliers that he was in debt with. That amount was basically all of her savings. This was 8 months before he asked me for the 1,000‚Ç¨.

They met up in person so that my mom could withdraw the money and give it to him in cash so that it would not be traceable by the IRS. Josh had agreed to pay all of it within a week when he was going to receive payment from a client.

Next week Josh said that he had other debts to cover and could not pay my mom right away, but it was coming. This went on, somewhat civilly, for a few months, with my mom asking for the money and Josh always making some excuse but promising to pay and thanking my mom for the patience and help.

I think the breaking point for my mom was when I told her I was pregnant in July of 2023. At the time I didn't know, but I thought it was strange how little she was spoiling me and the baby. I am now an independent adult, but I am aware of my privilege and how much my brother and I were spoiled. I would never expect it or count on it, but I always figured she would do her DIY for the baby or embarrassing custom clothes with lame catchphrases like she always did for my brother and me. But I could see that she was not in the right state of mind. Since she lost her job and became a stay-at-home mom, she always struggled with depression and her self-worth, so I was always very empathetic to her mental state. I could see the bags under her eyes getting bigger and bigger; she was getting skinnier and more irritable, so I did what I always do: tell her I love her and that I am here for her.

Now looking back, I can see it for what it was: all this mess with Josh that was stressing her out and eating her from the inside, and that she didn't spoil me or the baby because she literally didn't have any money to do it, or the mental capacity for it.

The tone of the conversation between Josh and my mom turned very ugly from both ends around that time, June/July of 2023. My mom started to lose patience and call him names, trying to emotionally blackmail Josh, saying he was ruining her life (I don't agree; she is a grown woman that made a decision and now is dealing with the consequences), and she started to harass him basically. She would call or text Josh every day by any means she could think of (call, message, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger) and then started doing the same to Josh's wife, but she quickly blocked my mom. Josh did too, except for my mom's phone number, out of respect, as he put it in one of the messages. But basically on and on for months, my mom would almost daily text or call him asking for her money; Josh would either not answer, say he would call back, and when she offended him, he would say that she was being crazy and disrespectful (which she was, with a reason, but she was) and tell her to get a life. I did see that she went off on Josh when he asked me for the 1,000‚Ç¨, the first time she ever defended me: ""After you did this to me, you go and ask my pregnant daughter for more money? How shitty of a person are you really?"" and I can't say I disagree...

When my parents returned from their holiday, I got my mom alone and confronted her about it. She didn't give more details than what I could find in the messages, but she asked something very hard of me: do not tell my dad because he doesn't know. When Josh asked for the money, my mom talked to my dad about it, and my dad very firmly said no, and my mom went behind his back and did it anyway. I had found out not that long before this that the IRS had seized Josh's assets because I found his house on auction on the IRS website. I had not been in contact with Josh since any of this came to my knowledge, but we did have friends in common who told me he was not doing well and had declared bankruptcy on his business to try to cover his debts as much as possible, and he already had two mortgages on the house that he could not pay anymore (hence why is was put on auction by the IRS).

I told all of this to my mom in that conversation because she was still (almost after a year) under the impression that Josh was going to pay her. I told her he doesn't have money to pay, and even if he does, he needs to pay all his other debts first before he can pay her. I wanted her to start accepting that it was money lost, honestly, that she was wasting her time and mental health on something that is just not going to happen, and it's out of her control. She brushed me off and said, ""Josh is going to have to pay me. It's my money, end of story!"" I had discussed this with my partner, and he knew what I was struggling the most with was being in the know and in the middle, without actually it being any of my business or being able to do anything about it. He gave a great suggestion to try to get a lawyer involved to see if there was any legal action my mom could take. I looked it up, and what I found was not very comforting, as the amount loaned was lower than what could be taken to court, and the fact that there was not a bank transfer, but it was in cash, does not help either. But I still found 2 lawyers that I thought we could meet just to get their opinion, and I showed my mom. She immediately refused because then she would have to tell my dad. I ended the conversation by saying she is an adult; she can do what she wants, but I didn't like keeping this from my dad and that for the sake of their marriage she should tell him anyways and that he could try to help, but the longer it went on, the worse it would be when he found out.

We went back to a new normal: pretending that problem didn't exist and me checking her messages behind her back to be up to date (don't judge me too hard please). Josh did try to reach out to me with a ""Hey, how are you doing?"" that I did not reply, and we haven't talked since. He didn't try to reach out again, so he probably assumed I knew.

I finally told my best friend about this, who is also a friend of Josh's, and it turns out her family was also impacted by Josh: against her advice, because she knew of what happened with my grandparents apartment, her stepdad hired Josh to renovate their house. They paid the 50% in advance; Josh's workers were there a week and never showed up again, nor did Josh answer the phone or provide any explanation. They ended up having to hire someone else because the week that they were there, they took the floor off and picked the wall of the entry of the house, so for months they had to daily pass over that mess. My best friends family took it as a loss and moved on after a while.

Around March of 2024, my mom asked me for Josh's home address because she was desperate. I didn't really think it through and gave it to her, but I told her to always tell me when she went there because it could be dangerous. She never did tell me, but from the messages that I secretly kept track of, I know she went there a couple of times, and Josh (of course) didn't like her showing up and bothering his wife and daughter and other family members that regularly stayed with them.

My mom did deleted older messages (stupid; now there is no proof if we ever need it), and the last time I checked was last month, and Josh had blocked her phone number as well since December 2024, when my mom showed up at his house at 11PM when his wife and daughter were sick and he was out of town.

Because we do have friends in common, I can keep up a little through social media, and see that even though he is bankrupt and now working for other people doing jobs here and there, Josh still goes out to dinner regularly, buys all these gadgets and expensive things, etc., and it pisses me off every time. It honestly consumes me on an unhealthy level every time I see or hear anything of him.

I am also worried about Josh taking some legal action against my mom if she keeps this up. She is (or was) literally harassing him and his family, and no matter how much she thinks she is in the right, it's not okay nor legal. And now I have no way of knowing because she would never tell me herself.

I have no courage yet to ask my mom again how things are; I still have this big secret that I am keeping from my dad, who is my person and has always done right by me. I haven't told my brother who I tell everything too, but I keep coming back to ""its not my secret to share, I am just an idiot that stumbled into this"". I am isolated because I barely want to see my friends in case I run into Josh or we end up on that topic. I have only ever shared this with one other friend, and it was because he asked why I wasn't attending anything the group planned. It's not my place to share my mom's mistake, and I honestly am a little embarrassed by it.

But it still is a shadow over me and over my relationship with my mom. And sometimes I do think she's not okay mentally, but she also doesn't want my help. I am torn between just not meddling anymore and taking action about this. A year of this stress and anxiety over it, and so many nights tossing and turning over something that does not affect me directly. A lot of times I can calm down by thinking my mom is a grown woman that need to deal with her own problems, but she is still my mom, who I do love and want to do anything for.

So I guess I am asking if you guys think I should just drop it and let things continue like this and not waste time on it? Any suggestions on how you would deal with this?

And if there are any Portuguese lawyers around, is there any legal course we/my mom could take if she ever changes her mind?

I thought forgetting would be a blessing. The pain of losing my daughter was unbearable‚Äîher small shoes still by the door, her laughter echoing in my mind. So when the stranger appeared, offering to erase the grief, I didn‚Äôt hesitate. ‚ÄúMake me forget her,‚Äù I said.

At first, it worked. Memories of Emma slipped away like sand through my fingers, and the ache dulled. But then, other pieces started to vanish. The taste of my morning coffee, the sound of my mother‚Äôs voice, my own name‚Äîall dissolving into a fog I couldn‚Äôt pierce.

My husband stared at me one morning, brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he asked, his tone sharp with confusion.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your wife,‚Äù I begged, clutching his arm. He pulled away.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been married. You‚Äôve got the wrong house.‚Äù

Friends forgot me next. My phone contacts emptied. My reflection in the mirror grew faint, edges blurring until I could see the wall behind me. I ran to the stranger, finding him in a shadowed alley, his eyes glinting with something cruel.

‚ÄúUndo it,‚Äù I pleaded.

He smirked. ‚ÄúThe price of forgetting is to be forgotten. You wanted her gone‚Äînow you both fade.‚Äù
