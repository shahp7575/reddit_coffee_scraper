going to the movies, catching a matinee sipping a soda or 'member fun dip?

now it's heroin or watch my friends beat each other in fights called ""relationships""

What the fuck happened, on dates I stare at a wall sipping a coffee with cool whip

Talk about jobs, feign we care about the dumb shit we're saying

I'd give anything to have the simplicity of my first steps as a baby

Where did the wonder go, but I know it's me that stares blankly

The innocence died, all the magic has ran out deep inside me

Wherever it went I don't think I'll find the map there in my 40s

Starting to realize that things come and go and that's the end of it rightly

At least it happened, back when movies were fucking $4.50

Back when I kissed a girl and it felt right even if it was randomly

Pairing up just because we didn't think about life's issues or family

The beauty of being young is mistaking you have time, its vanity

But there's this thrill when you aren't thinking about the future or anything

I'd give anything to have that thrill again, talking for hours about nothing.

## Keurig K-Cafe Essentials Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker: Your Daily Brew, Simplified!

The Keurig K-Cafe Essentials single-serve K-Cup pod coffee maker is more than just a coffee machine; it's your personal barista, conveniently nestled on your countertop. Designed for coffee lovers of all skill levels, from seasoned aficionados to complete beginners, this machine promises a simplified brewing experience without sacrificing quality or flavor.  Its affordability, ease of use, and impressive features make it a strong contender in the crowded single-serve market.  This in-depth review will explore its capabilities, address potential concerns, and ultimately help you decide if the K-Cafe Essentials is the perfect addition to your kitchen.

### Unboxing the Keurig K-Cafe Essentials: A Quick Overview

The K-Cafe Essentials seamlessly blends the familiar convenience of a standard Keurig K-Cup brewer with the added luxury of a built-in milk frother. This means you can effortlessly craft everything from a simple cup of coffee to a decadent cappuccino or latte, all from one compact machine.  Its sleek design and relatively small footprint (10.3” deep x 9.6” wide x 12.7” tall) make it a stylish addition to any kitchen, regardless of size.

### Key Features:  Brewing Perfection Made Easy

The K-Cafe Essentials boasts several key features designed to elevate your coffee experience:

* **Lightning-Fast Brewing:**  Enjoy a perfectly brewed cup in under two minutes. This speed is a significant advantage for busy mornings or when you simply crave a quick caffeine boost.  Consistent brewing times are a hallmark of this model.
* **Versatile Milk Frother:**  The integrated milk frother is a game-changer.  It effortlessly creates rich, creamy froth for lattes and cappuccinos, eliminating the need for separate frothers and simplifying the process.  Both hot and cold frothing options are available, catering to all preferences and seasons.
* **Customizable Strength:**  Control your caffeine intake with the adjustable strength settings.  The """"strong"""" brew option delivers a more intense coffee flavor, perfect for those who prefer a bolder taste.
* **Generous Water Reservoir:** A 60-ounce water reservoir significantly reduces the frequency of refills, saving you time and effort.
* **Effortless Cleaning:**  Many parts are dishwasher-safe, and the machine features a convenient descaling mode, ensuring easy maintenance and prolonged lifespan.

### Operational Modes: From Espresso to Iced Coffee

The K-Cafe Essentials offers a variety of operational modes to suit your coffee preferences:

* **Hot Frothing:**  Quickly heat and froth milk simultaneously for classic hot lattes and cappuccinos. Experiment with different milk types to find your perfect froth consistency.
* **Cold Frothing:**  Perfect for those hot summer days, the cold frothing option allows you to create refreshing cold lattes and cappuccinos.  This versatile feature adds another layer of customization.
* **Iced Coffee:**  Easily prepare refreshing iced coffee by placing your cup on the drip tray and selecting the appropriate setting.  This is a simple and effective way to enjoy your favorite beverage chilled.
* **High Altitude Mode:**  For those living at higher altitudes, the high altitude mode adjusts brewing parameters to ensure optimal coffee extraction, preventing weak or under-extracted brews.
* **Auto-Off Feature:**  The automatic shut-off function, which engages five minutes after the last brew, promotes energy conservation and adds an extra layer of safety.


###  Addressing Potential Concerns:  Cost and Maintenance

While the Keurig K-Cafe Essentials offers exceptional value, some potential concerns might arise:

* **Initial Cost:** The initial price point of around $189 may seem high compared to basic single-serve brewers. However, considering the integrated milk frother and overall functionality, it offers excellent value for money, especially when factoring in potential savings from not buying a separate frother.  Check for sales and discounts to potentially reduce the upfront cost.
* **Cleaning the Frother:**  While cleaning is generally straightforward, some users might initially find cleaning the milk frother slightly more involved than cleaning a standard coffee maker.  However, Keurig provides clear instructions, and regular cleaning prevents clogging and ensures optimal performance.
* **Descaling:**  Like all coffee makers, regular descaling is necessary to maintain optimal performance and taste.  The K-Cafe Essentials makes this simple with its built-in descaling mode.  Following the provided instructions will ensure a hassle-free process.


### Customer Experience and Reviews:  What Users Are Saying

Online reviews consistently praise the K-Cafe Essentials for its ease of use and delicious coffee output.  Many users highlight the convenience of the integrated milk frother and the ability to create café-quality drinks at home.  The consistent brewing speed and the quality of the brewed coffee are also frequently cited as positive aspects.  While some users mention the initial price point as a potential drawback, the overwhelming majority express satisfaction with the machine's performance and overall value.


### Conclusion:  A Smart Investment for Coffee Enthusiasts

The Keurig K-Cafe Essentials single-serve K-Cup pod coffee maker provides a compelling blend of convenience, versatility, and affordability.  Its exceptional ease of use, combined with its ability to create a range of coffee drinks, makes it an ideal choice for both beginners and experienced coffee lovers.  While the initial cost might be a factor for some, the overall value and positive user experiences suggest that the K-Cafe Essentials is a worthwhile investment for anyone seeking a simplified yet sophisticated coffee brewing experience.


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **What types of milk work best with the frother?**  The frother works well with various milks, including dairy milk, almond milk, oat milk, and soy milk.  Experiment to find your preferred milk and froth consistency.

* **How often should I descale the machine?**  The frequency of descaling depends on your water hardness and usage.  Refer to Keurig's user manual for specific recommendations.

* **Is the water reservoir easy to fill?** Yes, the 60-ounce water reservoir is easily accessible and simple to fill.

* **Can I use K-Cups from other brands?** While Keurig K-Cups are recommended for optimal performance, you can experiment with other compatible K-Cup brands.  However, results may vary.


This detailed review provides a comprehensive overview of the Keurig K-Cafe Essentials, focusing on its features, benefits, and potential drawbacks.  By addressing common concerns and highlighting the positive aspects, this review aims to guide potential buyers towards an informed decision.

The Midwest just got pummeled by a snowstorm. I measured 9” in my yard and the roads are not plowed, at least not where I am. This storm was predicted for days, and we all have been discussing it. 

Tell me why every local business has shut down for the day, but places like where I work simply do not have any snow plans in place. This isn’t the first time this has happened. All of our openers called off because it’s STILL snowing on top of what we already have, and it’s simply not worth risking lives and/or destroying your means of transportation. Then, as a supervisor at my location, I get a call telling me I need to open the store still, at 1pm. We close at 7:30! Nobody is going to be coming to us in the snowstorm! What is the point?

Why do they do this? I’m always told “one day of no business is bad” but small businesses seem to be making the decision to close very easily. I feel like there needs to be some regulation or law that forces companies to make plans in regards to snowstorms to ensure the safety of their employees. Because right now I feel completely uncared for as an employee and as a human. 

Needless to say I told them I’m not coming in, and neither is anyone else. One day off, on a day with most likely no business anyway, is not going to kill the company. ",1,1736179540.0,antiwork,1,1.0,False

I put the machine in descale mode and descaled with the remaining half volume. Then I rinsed the machine with clean water in descale mode and also backflushed a few times.

Wondering if the initial descale in normal made could have led to any issues?

The water was running clear towards the final rinse and backflush so I do think any remnants of the descaler have been flushed out but I just want to be sure.

Anyone else done this before?

I currently take home €3100 a month. 

I am married. We own our home, have no mortgage to pay. We have two cars, one of which is fully paid for and another car, which I pay €400 a month for. No kids. 

I have no outstanding credit card bills, no other loan repayments. Our monthly bills (electricity, heating, bins and internet) are approx €200 each. Food approx €300 each (at the absolute most and often less). I spend another €100 monthly on subscriptions (phone bill, gym, coffee subscription). 

I save into both our joint account (which is never touched) and my own savings account. However, I tend to use my own savings for things frequently enough. We have an excellent lifestyle and don’t deny ourselves anything. In saying that, I’d like to knuckle down on my own frivolous spending and think this is the year to knock it on the head. 

So I suppose, what I’m asking is given the above, how much would you try to save each month if you were in my situation?

1hv2a95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtsyWeirdoPerfume/comments/1hv2a95/full_review_of_the_nose_of_gatsby_discovery_set/,Full Review of the Nose of Gatsby discovery set,"On a whim (and because I had a coupon code), I purchased a discovery set from a random house on Etsy--""Nose of Gatsby.""

The discovery set is listed as coming with 2mL each of 10 fragrances, and there was actually an 11th fragrance in the box as well (with notes listed on the package insert):

\* Aura (Guaiacwood, Sandalwood, Cedar Forest, Frankincense, Gentle Touch)

\* Bespoke (Lavender, Sandalwood, Bergamot, Linen and Fabric, Oxygen, Steam)

\* Burning Piano (Burned Maplewood, Sandalwood, Copper Strains, Iris, Rose)



\* Double Espresso (Coffee Arabica, Bitter Chocolate, Cardamom, Rose, Oud, Seattle Air)

\* Fantome (Sandalwood, Black Pepper, Petitgrain, Fog, Mist, Shadow)

\* Naive (Black Tea, Incense, Rose, Tobacco, Fig, Sandalwood, Milk) -Sentimental (Rose, Rose Prick, White Rose, Myrrh, Geranium, Memory)

\* Single Shot (Yuzu, Sea Breeze, Gin, Ice and Salt, Pineapple, Eucalyptus, Sandalwood)

\* Superbloom (Rose de Mai, Jasmine, Orange Blossom, Bergamot Rind, Green Accord)

\*Tranquil (Pink Grapefruit, Bergamot, Orange Blossom, Green Accord-Nutmeg)

\*Trple Vanilla (Vanilla, Caramel, Waffle Cone, Hazelnut, Mysore Sandalwood, Jasmine)

It was $100, which is pretty steep for 20mL from a virtually unknown house, and probably should've been a red flag.

When the box arrived in the mail, the first thing I noticed is that it reeked of sandalwood. Like, through the mail packaging itself. Not a good sign--I'm not a sandalwood fan. I check the notes for the fragrances (and again, I bought this one on a whim and didn't do my research), and 6 of the 10 fragrances have sandalwood listed as a note. That one's on me, and I'm not going to penalize any fragrances for having sandalwood. I've smelled enough fragrances to know what sandalwood smells like when it's done well and done poorly, so I think I'm a fair judge. However, the smell of sandalwood radiating from literally everything in the package is so intense (I wonder if one of them leaked during shipping), that I have to keep it sealed in two layers of ziploc bags or else it makes whatever room it's in reek. But oddly enough--after smelling all the fragrances, none of them had that detectable sandalwood note that I was smelling. I later was wondering if maybe the perfumer spilled one of their sandalwood aromachemicals, or something like that.

Frankly the packaging leaves something to be desired--it's a cardboard box with the sample sprays just rattling around in some tissue paper. For $100 I have seen much, much better packaging. It comes with cards to spray it on, emblazoned with the nose of gatsby name and logo. The sample sprays also have a nice personalized label on them. The sample spray bottles are neither good nor bad, pretty standard.

Anyways, onto the smells. First, please note that I refer often to whether a fragrance is masculine- or feminine-leaning. This is not to say they are for men or women, but that there are certain ""styles"" that are generally associated as being more masculine or feminine, and I'm using that as shorthand here. All fragrances are unisex.

Also note that I do not comment on longevity or projection because I don't personally care about those, and because I sprayed on scent strips for the most part.

My overall review: a somewhat disappointing, overpriced houses. The perfumer excels most at feminine-leaning fragrances. The perfumer clearly has some talent but probably needs to spend more time on some of these. Overall their fragrances are a mix of pleasant but not groundbreaking, very wearable feminine fragrances; a couple blah masculine fragrances; and two fairly challenging, artistic but unpleasant and unwearable fragrances.

\* Aura: 3/10. Poorly bended, extremely muddy, amateurish. I could not pick out notes, it just smells like what I've smelled from beginner hobbyist perfumers who use way too many notes. It just smells like masculine-leaning, olfactory white noise with an overall woody angle. It gets a 3/10 because it wasn't overtly offensive, it was just--nothing. I think the perfumer was attempting to balance out their fragrances by offering a more everyday masculine-leaning fragrance, but this misses the mark.

\* Bespoke: 7/10. The best masculine-leaning one of the bunch. I actually do pick on something almost like a steam accord in it. A decent, elegant male fragrance.

\* Burning Piano: 2/10. Well, the name is accurate. If you've ever been near a wildfire region--when the forests are burning, the smell at first is honestly a pleasant, fireplace smell. The next day or two after, it turns into the most overwhelming, awful, burnt smell. That is this. I sprayed it on a sample strip. It is incredibly strong. I immediately picked it up, walked outside, and threw it in my garbage can because I didn't even want it inside. It gets 2 points for being accurately named, artistic perfumery, but is nothing I would ever want to smell again.

\* Double Espresso: 2/10. An incredibly acrid coffee smell. Hard to describe, unpleasant to smell. It's almost interesting in how acrid it is--like a coffeehouse forgot to take the beans out of the roaster or something. Unique, but absolutely unwearable. Masculine-leaning.

\* Fantome: 6/10. A pleasant, but muddy feminine fragrance. Light, airy, and I can't pick up much more than that.

\* Naive: 5/10. I do get a bit of the tea notes, etc, but overall it came across a bit muddy to me. Feminine-leaning. Pleasant though.

\* Sentimental: 6/10. Another vaguely pleasant, feminine-leaning, light fragrance. Floral with an emphasis on roses.

\* Single Shot: 7/10. Vaguely fruit candy. Smells a bit like opening a bag of Pez or something, and was fairly interesting. Dries down to a fairly standard, pleasant coconut. Feminine-leaning.

\* Superbloom: 7/10. A pleasant, well-blended, light floral. I think this would be very very nice during spring and summer; it's not particularly unique, but it's just overall well-done. The most wearable in the discovery set.

\* Tranquil: 6/10. I get mainly bergamot and orange blossom. Pleasant, feminine-leaning.

\* Triple Vanilla: 8/10. Smells like buttered popcorn mixed with vanilla. The best of the bunch. Feminine leaning, quite pleasant.

I will be looking to sell or trade this discovery set if anyone is interested. Each sample got 2-4 sprays and nothing more than that.",4,1736179134.0,ArtsyWeirdoPerfume,1,1.0,False

LAS VEGAS and NEW YORK, Jan. 6, 2025 – SolidddVisionTM smartglasses, the first true vision correction for people living with vision loss due to macular degeneration, make their CES 2025 debut in Venetian Expo, Eureka Park booth #62037.

The smartglasses technology was developed by [Soliddd Corp.](http://www.soliddd.com/), a New York City-based optical and vision technology company focused on restoring and improving sight for the millions of consumers worldwide with macular degeneration and other low vision disorders. 

Soliddd’s scientifically formulated and user-tested virtual reality smartglasses are lightweight and feel like normal eyeglasses. SolidddVision provides the first true vision correction—and, indeed, sight restoration—for those living with vision loss due to macular degeneration. The smartglasses use Soliddd’s unique and proprietary lens arrays, which resemble a fly’s eye, to project multiple separate images to the areas of the retina that are not damaged. This allows the brain to naturally construct stereopsis (the making of a 3D image in the brain) and a single full-field image with good acuity that feels like normal, in-focus sight.

At CES, Soliddd is featuring the beta headset version of its technology. The images here show the design for the actual consumer product to be introduced following rigorous patient testing and marketplace introduction in 2025. SolidddVision requires no FDA approval.

**Cutting Edge Technology and Global Patents**

Soliddd’s invention is over a decade in the making, leveraging its extensive know-how in 3D technology, portfolio of 15 U.S. and additional foreign patents (plus more pending) and proprietary optics and software including computer vision AI technology.

SolidddVision smartglasses use unique optics and software to beam many separate, in-focus views in a parallel-ray light field to all areas of the retina. The brain's visual cortex automatically constructs a single, stereo, full-field image with good acuity from the multiple inputs to each eye. Even if some areas of the wearer's visual field is blocked or unfocused, the redundant visual information received in other areas of the retina combines, resulting in the wearer seeing a full-field, well-focused and bright image.

*Caption: Soliddd's SolidddVision glasses allow people with macular degeneration to see the full normal visual field with good acuity by: (1) using two forward-facing video cameras to capture the world; (2) two inward-facing video cameras simultaneously map the inside of the eye for accurate automatic universal fit and gaze tracking; (3) software instantly processes incoming video with gaze tracking input and proper angle of view adjustment for stereo vision, correction for chromatic and spherical aberration, and other issues, and sends over 100 distinct views to two inward-facing displays behind SolidddVision lenses; (4) the viewer's brain then automatically brings together the separate images to construct a single, full-field 3D, sharply focused image for each eye.*

​

“Soliddd has invented the first true vision correction for macular degeneration. We can provide sight in areas of the visual field where patients otherwise see nothing,” said Neal Weinstock, CEO and founder, Soliddd. “SolidddVision smartglasses are lightweight and easily integrated into daily life. Our team is mission-driven to help restore and improve sight to the millions of consumers worldwide with vision loss caused by macular degeneration.”

The SolidddVision smartglasses breakthrough has been supported by physicians and scientists including numerous board certified ophthalmologists, retinologists and optometrists.

“I was able to observe numerous demonstrations of SolidddVision with patients affected by numerous ocular disease conditions including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and stroke,” said Georgia K. Crozier OD, MS and Director of the Moore Eye Institute Vision Rehabilitation Center in Pennsylvania. “These patients responded positively to the improved visual acuity and all believed it would help them in their daily activities. The enhancement of their reading vision and the ease of use was remarkable. This technology will be groundbreaking.” 

Scientists at New York’s Lighthouse Guild reviewed the data from a 30-person clinical study conducted by Soliddd on people with macular diseases. They found the results extremely encouraging for SolidddVision technology, showing an improvement in reading ability of many participants by 50 percent or more.

""My eyesight is so bad that I'm unable to do something as simple as read,"" said Judy Scheck, one of the SolidddVision alpha testers from the Chicago area. ""I'm nearly blind, but when I looked through the Soliddd device, I could clearly see a picture of Taylor Swift and, best of all, read some text. This is truly a life changing invention for me and others like me."" 

Another alpha tester, Megan Lisenby, who lives in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, shared these comments.

“Since the age of 19, I’ve lived with a black, empty smudge in the center of my vision with central cone dystrophy. When I tried the SolidddVision technology, for the first time in almost 30 years, that smudge disappeared and was replaced by any actual image. This opened my mind to all the possibilities of this technology to change a life. Simple human experiences most people take for granted could become extraordinary for me. Instead of only being present at my daughter’s drama performance, I could actually see her. To enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend and see her face as we talk. To watch my son’s excitement as he tells me about his day. To actually see facial expressions and emotions and not have to guess. This would be priceless to me.” 

SolidddVision smartglasses address the low-vision-aid market consisting of over 20 million Americans, and about 200 million people worldwide—and projected to grow—who live with distorted and even severe vision loss due to macular degeneration.

The company has earned numerous awards including the MassChallenge Alumni 1st Place 2024; HITLAB Breakthrough Challenge, December 2023; Unicorn Cup, World 1st Place 2023; and Digital Hub Health Foundation, HLTH 2024. Going into CES 2025, Soliddd earned a Consumer Technology Association Eureka Park Accessibility Award and a [Techlicious Editor’s Choice CES 2025](https://www.techlicious.com/blog/ces-2025-editors-choice-award-winners/) winner as one of the most innovative and impactful products and technologies that stand out from the crowd.

1hv23u9,https://i.redd.it/zl01a6elaebe1.jpeg,My bestie said his new gf is scared of me and I haven’t even met her yet,"Im 32F and Im talking about a 32M best friend. I’ll refer to the best friend as Blake. 
Backstory: I met my husband back in 2015 and did not let him and this friend meet for about 7-8 months. This is mostly because I knew my husband was ”the one” and wanted everyone to get along. I DID tell them about each other, only making sure to say positive things and common interests in passing. I wanted no miscommunication upon them meeting and to already have a good aura. This worked out really well, to the point Blake considers my husband a bestie and literally we all have matching tattoos. 

Well Blake was sleeping around for awhile, referring to each girl not even as their names to me but as a codename. One of these sleeps has since turned to a serious dating experience, within the last couple months. I was getting weird remarks from friend group (*why arent YOU on a double date OP?* and *Oh OP you heard from Blake? Hmm, he probably will talk to you soon…*). I didn’t know what anyone was talking about until last night, when I finally got Blake to open up via text where he gave me all the excuses to why he told everyone else (even my husband) but me. My husband not even telling me is kind of shocking, but he has a lot on his plate right now and it’s not his responsibility to fill me in on that stuff. 

Current situation: Blake’s new date has already met half the friend group. He told me she is ”a hundred percent afraid to meet you”. What terrors has he already told her that makes her scared of me?! I explained to Blake that when I chose not to introduce him and my husband, it was with the intent to plant positive mindsets and to NOT have anyone feeling like how this girlfriend is towards me. I feel like he probably told her about what happened with every other one of his dates -who’s redflags I foretold ended up being a blazing fire of truth. Hell, his last girl I had over my house and thought she was cool, and she still ended up calling the police on him, trying to get him arrested! She was as caught cheating and then the other guy called the cops to which she said Blake specifically was a ”creepy neighbor” (he lived in same apartment building as her) she ”didnt know” who was leaving her flowers and coffee. Me and husband had to show proof her and Blake were dating and that she was lying. Blake was so dumbfounded he had no clue what was happening around him. 

Since I found out about this new girl, Blake now suddenly wants us to meet, but still keeps emphasizing this new girl’s apparent fear. I don’t want her to feel pressured or intimidated. I’m just a person. It’s also not like I’d want Blake being single forever like hello, I absolutely DONT want to scare her off by existing. It’s his life. My feelings were just hurt he never told me anything, and now I feel even worse that this chick is straight up scared of me. Should I meet her? If so, how do I clear the air? 

TL;DR: Best friend’s new gf is intimidated by my existence. He told everyone about this new gf, telling me last which also hurt my feelings. He now wants us so meet. What should I do?",2,1736178678.0,WhatShouldIDo,12,0.75,False

Just to throw it out there- I don’t typically like coffee and I definitely don’t like oatmilk so I’m not sure how to answer my own question.

We have a regular and she’s the sweetest. She orders a venti cappuccino, quad, oatmilk, warm. She mobile orders a few times a week. She once complained to me that it tasted burnt. I offered to remake it and also use blonde espresso as I’ve been told it makes a big difference in taste. She agreed and said it was perfect and she loves blonde even more. I figured that maybe cured the burnt taste but the next day, she said the same thing. 

One thing we have both noticed is that her drink tastes burnt when I am not on bar. She often asks if I can be the one to make it because she claims it tastes perfect when i am the one to do it. She comes in during peak and I’m typically in the play caller position at that time. I don’t mind making her drink, and she’s very respectful of everyone. But I don’t want to screw up someone’s flow on bar, stop what I’m doing, or make someone feel incapable of making a cappuccino. I’m curious if while aerating the drink maybe the milk is being burnt? I don’t know this is such a dumb question but I just want to fix this for my sanity, her time, and baristas positions. ",1,1736178466.0,starbucksbaristas,5,1.0,False

Relevant back story and details of current trigger included.

Apologies if this is a bit of a ramble and jumpy. Once I started opening up, it became a little like word vomit. 

I've been diagnosed with PTSD for one event (well, one piece of a larger event anyway) from my childhood. But we never got to *all* of my tragic back story due to insurance and career changes (thanks 'insurance for profit' in USA). I would like to thank this group for introducing me to the concept of ""Complex PTSD"" as I now believe that tag fits very well. I am the unlucky recipient of many/most of the symptoms and as I've researched, I've had so many unlock moments while reading about my own past through the lense of other survivor's stories. Thank you. You matter. You are enough. I believe in your positive future.

Additionally, working on your mental health in my community often gives you a social black eye, so my work goes on mostly (we have a positive approach to MH in our home) behind the scenes. People, including my own FIL, often have asked over the years, how I turned out as well as I have after they only heard bits and pieces of information about my history while growing up. I never have the courage to tell them that if they only knew all of ""it"" they'd never ask or say it again. I present, very above average in life. I volunteer, I work on community minded projects, and I even have a very public facing job. No one sees the daily struggle that comes from growing up the way I did. In addition to a being a ninja, I'm a decent actor. My partner knows most things about my past, but working on your mental health and through traumatic events, often brings up new ""found"" memories that can rip the scab off of what was a closed wound.

I don't know why I'm posting. I know this is a ""me"" thing this time, but I just can't shake the feelings from earlier this morning. I'm struggling and this whole thing has made me feel helpless and small again. I'm an adult now, with growing, happy children and a loving partner for more than half my life. I still struggle, but they all give me the strength I need to push on.

Relevant backstory (did not cover this in therapy): 

I am the oldest child, but only because my older sibling died shortly after birth. I have one six year younger sibling.

Growing up, if you were an early riser, you damned well also be a ninja. The few times I woke my parents up, after I was more self-sufficient in my childhood, I would get yelled at (or worse *most* of the time) for disturbing their rest. Once they were up, I would have a *very* difficult day ahead of myself. Those days were miserable because I would experience most types of pain imaginable over the course of the day.  Yelling, hitting, negligence, and isolation... you get the idea, only for the entire day (CSA survivor as well, not from family. Obviously it was difficult upbringing). 

So, I became a ninja before 10am by the time I was 12 years old. Eventually, I moved throughout the house at all times without noise. We lived in an old creaky house, so... obviously being a ninja was a crafted, extremely necessary skill. I knew where every creaky board was, and had crafted paths through our home that yielded the least sound to minimize my presence in every way possible. If I was invisible and silent, I was safe, but also very lonely. (What a vicious cycle!)

Issue at hand: 

I've lived in my home for almost 20 years. To say I know every sound in my home would be an understatement. I don't need to be a ninja anymore, but old habits... 

This morning, I woke up about 5 minutes before my alarm to prepare for work. I quickly and quietly grab my phone that serves as an alarm so it doesn't go off to wake my partner. Remember. Ninja's don't wake up their partner while they get their rest. My alarm is for emergencies only. 

I move into the kitchen as the coffee finishes brewing and notice a pillow moving in the living room, on the couch. So I move to the living room to investigate the movement to be surprised by my partner on the couch. They have not been feeling well and didn't want to disturb my rest with coughing and other sickness noises. So overnight, they moved to the couch. It was an extremely kind gesture and only one example of the wonderful love that exists in our home. 

They've heard me ""banging"" around in the kitchen and decided to move back to our comfy bed, since I was awake and about to start my day. 

However, in the moment, I could ONLY think about how I broke the cardinal rule of the ninja academy of hard knocks. I WOKE SOMEONE AND DISTURBED THEIR REST. I'm in big trouble...

Internally, I start panicking, and externally I start apologizing for everything I have done within 5 minutes of waking up which included flushing the toilet and preparing coffee for myself. Neither activity was loud, but in my mind they were deafening once I realized my partner was awake. 

Initially, my partner was communicative with me as I was rattling off apologies for everything, but their exhaustion took over and they snapped at me abruptly to stop. We hugged briefly and they went back to bed. 

I know it was exhaustion. I know my partner will not make me have a terrible day as a result. But DAMN did it flash me back to the days before I became a ninja. 

Like I said. No real reason to post. All will be status quo again soon. But I have also realized if you communicate about why and how your triggers, triggered you, it will start to lose its power. That's my hope anyway. 

Good luck with your own journey. I wish you a peaceful and happy 2025.",2,1736178398.0,ChildhoodTrauma,1,1.0,False

You know, it’s funny—I always imagined I would work somewhere slightly more...cinematic? Instead, it’s me in a green apron, working for some evil mass consumer conglomerate.

It’s not all bad, though. There’s something oddly satisfying about the routine. Like, there’s this weird rhythm to it: Take order. Make drink. Hand it over. Repeat. It's like being in a scene that loops endlessly, but it’s comforting in a way. Or maybe I’m just getting used to the monotony.

There’s this one regular, a guy in his 30s who orders a venti black coffee every morning. No sugar, no cream, just black. He always looks so serious, like the fate of the world depends on that coffee. I’ve made up an entire backstory for him in my head. He’s probably a spy or something, and that coffee is the only thing keeping him sane. 

And then there’s my coworker, I'll call her Tasha. She’s exactly the kind of person I’d roll my eyes at in high school—super bubbly, always talking about her latest TikTok. But, oddly enough, she’s kind of growing on me. Her energy is so...relentless. It’s like she’s decided she’s going to be happy no matter what, and maybe that’s not such a bad thing?

The weirdest part of the job, though, is the customer names. People come in with the most bizarre names, and half the time, I’m convinced they’re just messing with me. Today, someone said their name was “Dragon.” I had to call out “Dragon” with a straight face.

Anyway, I think I’m starting to understand what all those coming-of-age movies are trying to say about these kinds of experiences. It’s not about the job—it’s about the people, the tiny interactions that make life feel a little less lonely. Or maybe I’m just romanticizing my minimum-wage job because I have nothing better to do. Either way, it’s all material for my inevitable graphic novel, right?

Here’s to another day of coffee, existential crises, and Dragons (wherever he may be).

Other benefit that I've noticed is my brain fog dissapeared. I rest better at night and get asleep very soon. I'm also dreaming a lot more. Sometimes I've wanted a cup of coffee because I've been travelling and tired but I now find the flavour disgusting.

1hv1v6n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hv1v6n,Help me decorate my living room,"We just moved in a month ago so I am still decorating.

Please help me style this living room to look warm and inviting.

Olive green is my main colour (island and dining chairs). So I balanced it with warm wood and tan leather. I need a third colour... beige?

We need more seating.... so maybe an accent chair?

Please help me choose rug, pillows, end tables and accent chairs. And if you feel extra inspired - wall art. (Especially over the dining table).

Few things to note: we will be installing wooden slats behind the couch just to create some separation and that guests won't be looking at the back of the couch when coming in. Also, we aren't looking for a coffee table (need space for kids to run and crawl and living room is small) but I am open to end tables. Mid century modern is my favorite style. Kids play mat and toys will be moving to the basement once it's finished.

1hv1u8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/1hv1u8g/looking_to_get_more_information_on_how_to_start_a/,Looking to get more information on how to start a food business under the Cottage Food Laws,"I've been making healthy snacks (energy balls, bars, chocolates, puttings, muffins, brownies, granola, even ice cream etc.) also soup and other healthy foods.

I recently looked into creating a social media presence for this project and start selling my products locally. Once it picks up then I would like to start shipping outside of my city and even across Ontario but within Ontario only until I figure out how to ship outside of it.

I read about something called Cottage Laws which apparently means Low-Risk Food Items.

Low-risk food items are generally considered non-hazardous and do not require time and temperature control. Some examples of low-risk foods include: 
• Most breads and buns (without meat, cream filling, etc.); 
• Most baked goods (with no custard);
• Chocolate, hard candies and brittles;
• Fudge and toffees; 
• Granola, trail mix, nuts and seeds; 
• Cakes (icing that doesn’t require refrigeration), brownies, muffins and cookies.
• Coffee beans and tea leaves;

I tried to attach a link I found to the most official document which discusses this topic and it wouldn't let me, but I did find some contradicting information online. In this document it seems that I still need to contact the authorities and advise them that I'm starting this process but in other places I read and it said that I can just start without advising anything to anyone, anywhere. 

As a percussion and also common sense step; I'm still going to get my food handling license because it's a pretty simple license to obtain and it's going to look nice on my videos when people see that I actually have it. I wasn't planning to get anything else. Maybe liability insurance which apparently is going to be less than 500 bucks a year considering how small the business is.

I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with anything like this. I know that right now I don't technically have a business until I actually set everything up and start selling stuff online and that could take weeks or months to develop but what happens when you've been doing it for a little while and only then tell the government that you've been doing it? So maybe it's better to start by informing them? I just want to know what the laws say.",3,1736177998.0,ontario,7,0.8,False

1hv1qas,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1hv1qas/what_was_your_experience_like_getting_diagnosed/,What was your experience like getting diagnosed? What treatments work?,"I randomly stumbled on a YouTube video about AuDHD and it blew my mind how much I related to it. Maybe it says something that autism videos randomly pop up in my YouTube feed even though I don’t search for them. 

I escaped getting diagnosed with ADHD as a child partly because my parents don’t care but also once I got bumped down to standard classes, I was able to get passing grades without studying or doing homework. But I have struggled with anxiety and executive function for as long as I can remember. It was almost physically impossible for me to do homework. And everything in my life was a disorganized mess. My backpack was just loose papers. My room looked like a bomb exploded in it. I had a lot of trouble making friends and relating to my peers. I ended up hanging out with the bad kids, who, in retrospect, were largely just other kids struggling with the same issues with social issues, anxiety, and executive function. 

As a young adult, I was basically just self medicating with alcohol that made social interaction tolerable. You can usually find a drunk person who will at least feign interest in talking about turtles or the American Revolution endlessly. I’m sure a lot of people found me excruciatingly annoying but I didn’t figure that out till later. 

After that got old, I was able to white knuckle my way in to a technical degree eventually. I have a very good job but I’m getting in trouble because my output sucks. I’m able to pick things up fast enough that I can put things off and still get it done but it’s so hard to get started. And the social/political aspects of the job go right over my head. I don’t understand office politics. Talking to people I need things from gives me as anxiety attack. I don’t know how to contribute to meetings. I try to say informal things to seem relatable and form relationships. Things like bringing up something about my kids or the weather and it just feels so awkward and people don’t really respond. Other people can have conversations naturally and are able to form relationships with their coworkers. 

I have so many hobbies, I joke that my main hobby is collecting hobbies. Photography, making bread, I got way too deep in to making Italian food, coffee, brewing beer, drawing, collecting fountain pens, bicycling, fishing, playing music (the only real constant.) There’s probably a dozen more I’m forgetting. Some of these don’t seem that deep but they can be - at one point I was deep in to researching building bicycle frames so I could build my own. It’s not enough to just enjoy riding a bike. 

Somehow I managed to get married and have kids. But my wife told me I’m autistic once. I took it as a joke. 

Is everyone just secretly socially awkward or is this autism? I’ve been fairly certain I have ADHD for a while. But I find so many of the memes here relatable. 

I’ve been in therapy for a year or so now but my normal therapist is on leave. We’ve never talked about autism. I have some OCD symptoms and I think she thinks my problem is anxiety and childhood trauma. 

I recently got in trouble at work and I’m desperate to fix my brain. I guess I should talk to my replacement therapist but I don’t see her for a while. Is this something a LCSW can diagnose? Do I need a psychiatrist? Are there effective medications?",3,1736177724.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

So my ex (25m) and me (27f) of 7 years broke up a couple months ago.
We have 2 kids
We has just moved to a new state to start a new life and etc and switch roles as I was the one working and he stayed home with the kids. 
I supported the 4 of us our entire relationship, he had a job here and there but never lasted. I took care of everything. In our relationship he lied alot. I have no trust in him (one of the reasons he broke up with me) 
Now I'm stuck here I'm this new state where idk anyone, we are still living together till I figure out where to go ( I have a plan but I'm going to be here for 6 months until the kids and I can move) he's working, making really good money and claims he's trying to save for his own car. We have shared mine. 
Anyways my car is MY car. Bought it before I met him, it's in my name. 
Before we broke up he was taking my car to work, I continued to allow that after we broke up until he started turning his location off and doing what he wanted with it, besides to and from work. So I set a boundary, either turn your location on so ik where my car is or I'll take you to and from work. That started shit, he is paying for the gas and insurance (bc we moved here to switch roles and I have no income)so he thought that gave him entitlement to do whatever he wants with it bc he was paying for it. 
so we're past that now and I've been letting him drive it again and I've just been tracking the miles on my car compared to what progressive snapshot shows. 
I have asked him to not have anyone in my car. 
He did. I noticed small things were moved in the passenger so I asked him about it, he told me and said he forgot to tell me.
Well last night he I asked if he was going to have anyone in the car with him again. He said no. He said he would tell me bc I deserve to know where my car is, and who is in it.

 This morning he got us coffee, which he has been doing every day. So I know the time and miles it takes for him to leave work, get coffee, and come home. I've been tracking it all. This morning, the time and milage was doubled. And on my coffee cup, the sticker with the label has the time it was got, and it shows he got 3 items. Idk if he got food for himself, which is fine if that's the case, but bc of the time frames and miles, I think he got someone else coffee and gave them a ride. 
He works nights and is sleeping and I'm planning on asking him.about this when he wakes up but I don't want to start shit like last time. Idk how to bring it up without him calling me petty again. Bc i know he lied. So if he is going to continue to lie and be shady and hide things, I'm going to go back on my boundary and not let him drive anymore and either take him or he can find a ride (which is what he did the last time until I let him.drive my car again)
Am I the ass hole for setting that boundary? How can I ask him.about this and set thst boundary without causing conflict? Please, any insight is helpful. ",2,1736177681.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

The usual story. Female, 30. Metabolism has been totally shot for a while now. Used to be effortlessly slim (never above 120lbs) but had body issues and developed an ED and then started dieting/over-exercising/bad nutrition that overstressed my system and made me extremely high cortisol. The past decade of getting my shit together (schooling, career, etc) has caused a progressive increase in weight, lethargy, sleep issues, stress, etc. 

I got thyroid tests that read as slightly-low-but-normal, but I showed all the markers for slow metabolism— including as I’ve recently discovered— low basal body temp. I also show signs of estrogen dominance, which I’ve recently learned is a related co-mornidity.

I heard of Peating but didn’t know where to start until I started reading Deering’s book, some Peat articles, and some forums about a week ago+ began my journey to fix my fucked up system.

Small diet changes to far:
- Removing PUFA to the best of my ability. I cook a lot of asian food so I swapped soy for coconut aminos. I still use a drop of sesame oil for flavour here and there but I hope to find an alternative swap. I only cook with butter, rendered animal fat. or coconut oil now.
- More collagen. I put collagen powder in soups + make gelatinous broth from scratch when I can (using knee caps, feet, knuckles)
- Coconut oil. Try cooking with (or eating) a teaspoon or more a day. My body handles it very well.
- No nuts + no more fermented food. This was hard for me to let go of since I love kimchi, kombucha, and all the sour/spicy snacks. I still have some plain high protein greek yogurt here and there. 
- No more grains— trading them instead of potatoes. If I do have them it’s a small portion of white rice or organic oats
- Carrot salad regularly
- OJ with fat 
- Ice cream at night
- Swapping green tea for coffee
- Fruit and berries as snacks

Haven’t gotten into organ meats just yet because idk how to cook with them, but I will soon. Trying to make this a sustainable journey so I’m making incremental improvements. 

I currently take these supplements:
- Vitamin D 25mcg
- Inositol 500mg
- Magnesium Glycinate 200mg
- Zinc Citrate 50mg


I’m early in my journey and already seeing some slight improvements in my gut health, sleep, and energy levels. Body temp seems to have also risen slightly. It’s only been a week though so it could all be psychological. 

Does anyone have any advice for my current changes? Anything I should add? I wanted to try Progest-E. For context, I am Canadian and our healthcare system + available products are limited. So getting certain medications/supplements can be difficult for me.",1,1736177639.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

At the start of the relationship he was really passionate, couldn't do enough for me and wanted to do anything to make me happy/ comfortable. We have been together for a year an a half. He has some personal struggles at the moment and I try my best to make life as easy as possible for him in the mean time, I cook every meal he eats, I clean, I go along with anything he wants to do and rarely ask for much. Our sex drives have always been different but I have accepted that I can have less sex than I'd like as the relationship was so good and I finally felt loved, he was attentive and tactile, he'd have a glass of wine waiting for me after work, he'd get up before I left to do me a coffee, he'd make me lunch with cute little notes attached to it, he'd open car doors, pull out my chair, hold my hand & always touching eachother. However since about July all of this has depleted, hes a lot more snappy and inpatient with me he lets doors go when we walk through them, he expects me to sort all of the dinners, he gets out of the car and walks down the street with mw tailing behind, if theres jand holdig or touching it comes from me, we have sex about once every week / 2 weeks and there is no passion and always in bed and rarely do I get what I need.

I have asked if he's still attracted to me and he was really upset that I felt like that and reassured me he is. We talked again after and I said I miss who he was at the start and He said that all relationships get lazy and comfortable like this and that my thinking that things can be like they are at the start is me living in a Disneyland..

1hv1i4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DunkinDonuts/comments/1hv1i4u/hot_chocolate_discontinued/,Hot chocolate discontinued?,"The day before Christmas at my closest Dunkin location, I couldn't find hot chocolate on their online menu so I went in and asked about it - the woman working the counter told me they didn't have hot chocolate. I was so surprised. I don't remember the last time I got it - it's what I get for my husband if he wants something when we stop for me to get coffee.

Then today, a couple weeks later, I see hot chocolate listed in the rewards redemption offers so I check the menu again, and there it is - hot chocolate on the menu. This is at a different Dunkin location down the road.

Does anyone know why one location would offer hot chocolate and another wouldn't? I thought menu options would generally be more consistent across locations. Is it discontinued and going to disappear from their menu soon also?

Google searches are all talking about dunkaccinos being discontinued in 2023 and I can't find a straightforward answer. This can't still be leftover stock from 2023... right? Thanks for any help!",0,1736177119.0,DunkinDonuts,5,0.5,False
1hv1g2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hv1g2c/does_this_sound_like_he_is_interested_and_is_it/,Does this sound like he is interested? And is it possible to change his first impression of me (we met under negative circumstances)?,"There's this guy from company I've had a bit of turbulent relationship with. We don’t really work in same department, but some shitshow happened in company and we had several situations where we went into arguments. We both were tense and paranoid around each other for few months, but had some random chitchats in company parkinglot. I, however, liked him from the moment I saw him (both looks and this stupid stubborn righteous personality of his lol) and after situation calmed down a bit, I gave him small gift with a message of future successful professional cooperation. He thanked me profoundly and asked me out for coffee and few days later helped me with some work related stuff (he offered, he didn’t need to) and twice asked me for a short coffee after we finished working (he initiated both coffees but also ended both coffees, said he had to go). We joked, laughed, he often looked me into my eyes and I looked into his, he even mentioned being single, we talked movies and series and music… I sent him reel after coffee and he answered and even asked me what was I doing and asked about music video he mentioned me, but when I answered he gave quite short answer even though I left space for him to add more to conversation. He also didn't like my instagram story (even though he asked for my insta). I usually read people very well, but have very hard time reading him. However, I think there were definitely some flirty moments (more at coffee than through messages). Since our first coffee until today passed about a week.

Does this sound like he is interested (I fear my hopes cause me to imagine stuff and he is just nice person and not actually interested in me…)? I’d like to ask him out in a few days, maybe to a stand-up show (I have two tickets), but don’t know if that’s too soon? Also, even though I am in my late 20s, I never kissed before (lacked self-confidence, doing much better with it now) and don’t know if there are any clear signs to give I am available to kiss? I’d like to let him initiate it, but I fear maybe he is also a bit careful due to our arguments few months before? Also, going from “enemies” to “lovers”, could that even work or will his view of me always be influenced by memory of our first tensions?

I liked him for a couple of years yet we didnt speak. When we first got speaking I felt we got on well. The next time we spoke I thought he looked as if he liked me. He left me home and I was in awe. I found him online and asked him for coffee. He said hed be free all weekend. Saturday at 6 am he sent a message to meet at 11. I was away on a sunrise swim and said could we re arrange. No he said just leave it. But I could be back for 11, no just leave it. 

Then just bump ins. An older woman sat down beside him, clearly all over him. He reciprocated. I got up and spoke to a friend and his two children, and she left, he got up and I introduced him to my friend. 

Couldn't remember friends name as he took a spiritual name and man I was interested in called me old age. It was the way he did that, older woman sat down and i was called old. Was just a joke that he didnt remember saying. 

Next bump in he bought coffee with coupons, and then said are you sitting there waiting for me to buy you coffee. Breadcrumbss ?

Always talked over me, if I started a conversation he would take over.

Blocked me when I reacted to all of the above. 

Year later after i kept my distance he came back, but talked about his dog lying all over a girls lap and his ex. 

Concealed his phone holding it away for some strange reason. 

I feel he took a rejection where there was none and made me pay for it.

1hv1dmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hv1dmj/sharing_a_2nd_date_success_story/,Sharing a 2nd Date Success Story! ,"For our first date, I took her to a cozy coffee shop that transforms into an intimate bar in the evening. It was a cool night with snow expected to start falling by the time our date ended. Typically, my first dates last about one to two hours, but this time was different, lasting almost four hours. I’ve been on many dates before, but there was something captivating about her. Words can’t fully capture how I felt in that moment.

As our date was coming to an end, she ordered an Uber. While we waited outside, snow began to fall. In that perfect moment, I leaned in for a kiss. It was just a small peck, but it felt like time stopped. Her Uber arrived and as I walked to my stop afterward, I couldn’t stop smiling – it felt like a scene straight out of a Hallmark movie.

I wanted to see her again, but she was traveling for the next two and a half weeks. During that time, we kept in touch over text. I even went on another date, but I couldn’t stop thinking about her. She had become the standard I didn’t know I was looking for.

When she finally returned, she asked to see me the very next day. I wanted to plan something fun and memorable, so I took her mini golfing, followed by dinner at a cool restaurant, and then we ended the night at a classy bar for drinks.

Even though we were having our last round of drinks at a crowded bar, her voice was the only thing I could hear. It felt like we had slipped into our own universe. As the night was winding down, I asked if I could kiss her. She smiled and said of course. Our kiss felt electric so much so that I think we gave the entire bar a show. Afterward, she asked if I wanted to keep the night going. We ended up spending not just the night together but most of the next day too. When I asked her what she thought of the kiss at the bar, she said it was definitely unexpected but added that it would be amazing if every day could feel like that.

Later that day, I walked her home in the afternoon, already looking forward to our third date.",4,1736176783.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Everything looked like he'd get through it until they called at 4:30 this morning to tell us he'd taken a turn for the worse, was unconscious due to a brain bleed. The decision was made to let him go, not put him through anything else. 

We lost our beagle in Jan. 2020 and that was painful, but she was old, sick, and we knew it was time. This pain? I don't know I've ever experienced it like this before. Our family is devastated of course, but I am in fucking agony. 

I was just outside and his footprints are there in the snow, but fading and soon will be gone. His toys are laying all over the yard where he left them. His last meal, half eaten, still in the bowl. 

He was my best friend and the best dog I've ever known. Everything I did throughout the day, he was there with me. His bed was next to me and in the night I'd be comforted by his light snoring or contented sighs ( often seeming to mimick my own. ) He sat with me in the morning when I had coffee and slept in my lap, no easy feat for a 70 pound boy. When I made breakfast, he got some of it. Every day we took a walk together. He ""helped"" me with morning and evening chores and we always played fetch before going in when evening came. None of that will ever be the same again. 

The house has felt so empty without him the past couple days, but we thought it was temporary. Now it's permanent.

1hv1bp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hv1bp5/supply_run/,Supply run,"The Anansi senator sighed, her grey fingers clutching a mug filled with the caffeinated beverage. She made a mental note to get some more of the coffee powder as she had almost run out, despite trying to reduce her intake of the glorious liquid. It would be several hours before she was finished going over the documents that had all but filled the storage space of her PDA, as such the energy filled drink was necessary for the daunting task ahead of her. Taking another long sip, she sat back at her desk but paused as a rattling sound could be heard from above her.

After staring at the ventilation duct for a few moments the noise stopped, allowing her to return to drafting yet another trade agreement. Once more plunging into the monotony of clauses, regulations and airtight phrasing as to not allow loopholes. Just as she finished one of the statements regarding what narcotics were permitted, the rattling sound started once more only this time it was louder and much, much closer.

""What in the ancient's name-?"" She began, only for the vent cover above her desk to be flung open and a large shape to fall from the now open vent.

""Shit shit shit!"" The shape was shouting as it crashed into and promptly crushed the Anansi's desk, luckily not harming the politician in the process. ""Ahhh fucks sake, they need to make those things more sturdy, Jesus H christ...""

""Who-what...how?!"" The Anansi began backing away from the figure that now was trying to get up from the ruins of her workspace. Once the creature had managed to stand upright she realised what it was, a human or more specifically an Ares variant. The Ares variant humans were what they called 'super soldiers' typically they were taller, stronger, faster and generally superior humans but with the downside of significantly reduced lifespans.

""Sorry about the...mess..."" The Ares variant seemed to notice the fact he had destroyed a very expensive piece of furniture and finally addressed the Anansi properly. ""Um, my apologies Lady Renaia, I did not mean for...this...""

""Why were you in the ventilation shaft?!"" Renaia shouted back at the man, her reptilian face twisted into a look of incredulousness as the Ares variant began dusting himself off and looking over toward the cupboard at the side of the office.

""Uh, supply run ma'am, we ran out of coffee. Figured you wouldn't mind if we... borrowed some."" He explained, only further baffling the Anansi.

""You broke into my office...for caffeine?! There are free supplies of such in the break room for all staff, including the outsourced security such as yourselves!"" The politician's voice hitched as she only grew more and more incredulous, wondering just how many security protocols the Ares variant had breached for a simple drink.

""Well, we don't count. Far as the Federation is concerned, me and the other Ares aren't people so we don't get amenities."" He said, a look of suprise on his own face. ""What, you didn't know?""

""Surely not...? You can't just...not count people as sapient because they were artificially created...?"" As the Anansi began having her own internal debate over the information given by the variant human, he had opted to make his way to the nearby coffee machine and began filling a small bag with the coffee grounds, stashing it in one of his pockets once he had taken a sufficient amount. He paused as he noticed the machine still had some left before taking a mug from the cupboard and setting it to make him a drink.

""You should ask before taking something, especially if you intend on taking the last of my coffee as well."" Renaia then sighed as she turned her attention back to what was her desk, luckily her PDA was in her hands when the variant had landed so it was still intact at least. Though as she looked back toward the man, she noticed something she hadn't before, he was wearing a collar of some form. ""What is that around your neck?""

""What do you think? They don't give us basic amenities so how do you think they keep us from acting up?"" The politician was stunned, she stood with her mouth agape for a moment before approaching the variant.

""Your own people did this...?"" She asked, her expression showing clear concern at the device around the man's neck.

""Hah, they don't even know we exist, it was the Federation that made us in the first place when they kicked the regular humans out. So to answer your question, no my people did not do this."" He replied, noting that his drink was finished and taking a long gulp of the freshly boiled brown liquid. ""See this is why we raid your office, you get the bougie stuff.""

""So you are the reason why im always low on coffee! And, bou...gie? As in... high quality?"" Her question earned a nod from the variant who promptly took another sip from the mug.

""And expensive, way more than it should be."" He then approached the ruins of the desk, almost admiring his handiwork and let out a sigh. ""So... how big of a bill should I expect?""

""250,000 credits but somehow I don't think I would see the money from you, not without ruining your life in the process at least."" She replied, offering a weak smile.

""Jesus... must've been a nice desk."" His expression turned to one of minor embarrassment as he swallowed the remainder of his coffee and set the mug on the counter. ""Welp, must be off, got more offices to break into and so on.""

""You what?!"" 

""I'm joking, we only break into yours."" He smirked, pausing for a moment before grabbing a stool and setting it below the still open ventilation duct. ""Thanks for the coffee ma'am!"" In one fluid motion, the man had jumped from the stool and pulled himself back through the vent. Renaia did a double take as she realised the man had jumped roughly 10 feet from a standing position, her mouth agape in surprise as the man disappeared into the duct.

""Wait, before you go-!"" She called out, though stopping herself and expecting for the Ares to have already gotten too far to hear her. This was quickly proven wrong however.

""Yeah?"" The man's upside-down head peaked out from the vent.

""You didn't tell me your name."" Renaia stated, earning a grin from the variant. 

""Sergeant Thomas Anderson ma'am, now I've some friends expecting some coffee any time now and I dont intend on disappointing. I'll see you around!"" And with that the man was gone, his exit once more causing the rattling sounds within the vent.

With a sigh, Renaia looked over the ruins of her desk then back to her PDA. She then sat in her thankfully undamaged chair and opened up a new document which she promptly titled ""Artificial sapient rights, first draft"".",18,1736176640.0,HFY,6,1.0,False

She really shows off at doctor's appointments and only the answers to date/president/remember these words give her away.  She can ask me about coffee three times during a visit and can't seem to remember that there is coffee in her canister and a new bag in the pantry.  She know longer drives (thank goodness she gave that up easily), but my big concern is her absolute lack of ability to plan anything anymore.  For example:  my sister is coming to visit from out of state.  Instead of mom doing what she would have five years ago and make up the guest beds, stock the pantry with foods my sister enjoys, and make sure the bathroom has towels, or even ask for help with these things, she just sits on her couch, surrounded by her nest of things she uses most.  When I ask where the towels are for the bathroom, she states they are in her closet, but when it's revealed they aren't, she just forgets the original question and stares into space.  I ask again, as if it's the first time, she again tells me her closet.  I give up, but I discover the towels folded in a guest bedroom.

My life revolves around literature, theology, and philosophy because apparently, I thought, Why not overthink everything while also sounding pretentious? Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.

When I’m not passionately arguing with myself about the meaning of life (or why tea will forever outclass coffee), you’ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting like a mad scientist who traded test tubes for spatulas. Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.

Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.

I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

In a nutshell, I’m equal parts thinker and clown, with a dash of culinary chaos. My DMs are open, so slide in like a confident penguin on ice.

*****Some things are repeated as I have combined several lists. I'll work on it later.*****

I grew up partially off-grid and this comes naturally to me because of my upbringing. But as an adult, I realized that many no longer think about alternative ways of getting their needs met.

ARE YOU AND YOUR HOUSE PREPARED FOR A WINTER STORM

If power goes out, what will you do?

Do you have alternative heat sources?

*Wood stove?

Do you have a battery powered CO/CO2 detector for when using a kerosene or propane stove inside? 

If you use a non-vented propane or kerosene stove inside you need a battery powered CO alarm in the same room. Always open a window a small amount.

Remember, with the very young and the elderly, even short times without heat might become life threatening. So don't forget to check on your neighbors when the powers goes out.

Do you have alternative power light sources?

*If cell service is too weak to understand speech, a text message may still be able to be transmitted.

*Phones that are not currently on a cell service can still make 911 phone calls, so even keep older phones charged before bad weather.


And lastly, sanitation? Can you clean yourself? 

*Baby wipes?

# In a parking orbit over Azzaad:

The *Robin Williams* was the odd girl out for a flag vessel.  A light cruiser, some might even call her a frigate, not ideal for a formation's flag officer's security in some people's estimation.  Sergeant Linus George was not one of those people.  He knew full well that speed was the most important factor in the Second Star Rapid Response Group's success, and he knew so well because they were the ships responsible for putting the Lost Boys on the dirt where they needed to be.  So really, in a formation of nearly exclusively destroyer class vessels, a light cruiser was a perfectly good flag ship in any of the Lost Boys' estimation.  Besides, she had plenty of room aboard her for all of the officers of the division, and all of the officers of the RRG, and even had a little extra room for NCOs and officers from outside the formations both RNI and Navy.  In Sergeant George's humble opinion, she was the best ship in the fleet for a conference, and not the least of his reasons was that while she had plenty of room for conferring, she did not have enough room for lodging.  He would be back on the *Tiger Lilly*  to bunk down in his own berth.

Even with all of those excellent reasons to love the *Robin Williams,* he still had a deeper, more personal bias toward her.  His father's posting was between her bulkheads.  It had been over a year since he'd seen Major General Eric George outside of his official capacity as the divisional commander.  He was looking forward to shaking the old man's hand and sharing news over a quiet beer.  Not so much the news that needed sharing, but that was a separate thing.  A trooper took his pleasures where he could find them whether they came with pain and sorrow or not.  He was looking forward to seeing his big brother even less.  Captain Johnathan George and he were going to have words.  Unpleasant, necessary words.

It was, therefore, understandably disappointing when he found Captain George before the general.  There was no sense in putting off the inevitable, so he walked right up to where his last living older brother stood among a knot of butterbars giving them advice on how to not be idiots in his duty uniform with his shiny new silver pips on his collar and tapped the man on his shoulder.  ""Square up,"" he said in a hard, flat voice.  Hard and flat like a hammer.

The second lieutenants jaws dropped and their eyes popped out of their skulls as Sergeant George stepped back and dropped into a fighting stance as his older brother turned to glower at him.  ""Linus, what the fuck do you thi-"" he started to say.

Sergeant George eloquently pasted his older brother's nose with four knuckles.  ""I said square up, ingrate,"" he snarled, ""you and I have words to say to one another.""

Captain George fell into a fighting stance and snapped a kick at his little brother's knee while snapping at him, ""You have no right to call me that you little shit!""

Sergeant George stepped into the kick and caught it at the knee with his left hand, and sank his right fist into the captain's kidney.  ""The fuck I don't,"" he fairly roared before driving his forehead into his brother's already bloody nose, ""A year!  A year you go fucking dark!""  

Captain George wasn't going to just stand there and politely take a beating, especially not from little Linus.  No, he shifted his weight and hooded this captured leg around the sergeant's body so that they both tumbled to the deck, then he seized his brother by the ear punched his brother in the mouth.  ""It's none of you God damn business!""

This was familiar to the captain.  All growing up, Linus had never beaten him in either a sparring match or a real fight.  Except Sergeant George wasn't a kid any more.  He drove his knee into Captain George's belly and put his knuckles in his throat hard enough to force the larger man to flop off of him to the deck.  He gasped and growled, ""You made Mom cry.  Of course it's my fucking business!""

Captain George dropped the punch he was preparing to throw even as he gasped and choked for breath through his bruised throat and looked away.  ""Shut up.  You don't get it.""

Then, before Sergeant George could further explain just what an asshole his big brother had been via a few more bruises, the shadow of a colonel fell over them.  ""On your feet!"" the man snapped.

The brothers scrambled to their feet and stood at attention while snapping off a salute.  Sergeant George noted that his ribbons did not include the one denoting belonging to or having belonged to the Lost Boys.  Well, a court martial wouldn't see his career completely ended.  The fact that he'd declared his intent and given fair chance for defense would go a long way.  The fact that he didn't wait for his older brother to accept the challenge before getting started would maybe be a sticking point.  The colonel's eyes flicked up and down twice, snapped to one ribbon block to the other, went wide with surprise, then to name tags, all before narrowing with tight, officer-ish anger.

The brothers could see a loud and lengthy public reaming building behind the colonel's eyes.  It began, ""Just when in the name of merry fuck did the corridors of a Republican Naval vessel become a place for family squabbles?  I don't give half a fuck which one of you idiots threw first, you should both be busted back to privates and put on fucking broom patrol for the next ten years!  Both of you morons should know better, but maybe since you're a couple of Daddy's precious projects you never got the idea of discipline through your thick fucking skulls!  Well now I'll skull fuck you with that fucking discipline so maybe it'll stick in what little brains you managed to scrape together between you!""

A familiar, steady, calm, solid and implacable as a mountain voice came from behind the brothers stoically soaking in the tirade, ""Thank you Colonel, I believe I can take it from here.""

The colonel puffed out his chest and stepped between the frozen NCO and officer as if they weren't there and snarled, ""If you think you can get away with going easy on your sons…""

Major General Eric George did not scowl, or glower, or raise his voice, or puff out his chest to meet the man's challenge.  He merely fixed the irate man with a steady gaze and softly said, ""I think no such thing, Colonel.""

The colonel wilted under that gaze, and he harrumphed and turned to leave, but forgot that there was an NCO still standing at attention to his left, and so collided with Sergeant George and bounced off, harrumphed again, and stalked off angrily.

""Johnny, Linus, if you would please follow me,"" General George softly ordered.  It was unmistakably an order, and both of them found themselves wishing for the public reaming back.

The two brothers followed their father through the stark corridors of the ship and tried to look at anything except their father's broad back and each other except in furtive, sidelong glances in silence.  Sergeant George started rehearsing his version of events and potential arguments in his head.  He had a sense of foreboding that it would do him little good, but he did it anyway.  Eventually, they entered General George's spartan, nearly bare office where he sat down behind his desk, whose holographic display still showed the mountainous amount of work the general had to do, and commanded, ""Sit.""  They did so, drawing the collapsible chairs from the office wall and unfolding them in silent anticipation.  ""Explain.""

""He hit me first,"" Captain George blurted out, sounding for all the world more like an aggrieved Johnny than an RNI officer.

""He went dark since Rodger got killed.  No calls, no emails, leaving all our texts on sent.  Even Mom.  She called me up and asked me to get him to call her, so I did.""  Sergeant George did not sound much like a noncommissioned officer of the RNI, and a lot more like a hurt and furious little brother.  ""He didn't even bother looking at Mom's messages when we got the news about Robbie.  Didn't fucking bother.""

""Three things,"" General George said, ""First, do you believe your mother intended you to or would appreciate your method of communication with your brother?  Second, do you believe perhaps your father might have had something to say to Johnny on the subject of his long silence?  Third, do you believe that it is appropriate to challenge a superior officer to a fistfight in the corridors of a Republican Naval vessel?""

Sergeant George started feeling the familiar chagrin and shame at his father's disapproval rise up within him as he answered in order, ""No, sir.  Aye, sir.  No, sir.""

Captain George was beginning to look a little smug until the general's eyes fell upon him.  His smirk quickly dissolved.  ""Your brother having acted wrongly does not make you suddenly right Jonathan Yormdrill George.  Wipe that smirk off of your face before I do it for you.""

""Aye, sir.""

General George stared at his oldest son for a long moment before he said, ""Your refusal to communicate in any capacity other than AA reports with me, and your continued refusal to speak with your mother, living brothers, and your cousin has put undue strain on each of them and on the family as a whole.  If you for a second try to justify that none of us can fathom what it is like for you, recall that Robbie and Rodger were *my sons* just as much as they were *your brothers.*  Grief may excuse some seclusion, but you have moved beyond seclusion and into neglect.  This has led you to be ignorant of several facts concerning what members of the family are still alive.  For instance, Yoivedrill has resolved to join the RNI when he is of age next year, and Pete has gone missing in action.""

The captain could not look more shocked, horrified, and pained if the general had hit him.  ""I'm… I'm sorry, sir…"" he mumbled at the deck.

""You will look me in the eye and speak clearly when you speak to me, Captain.""

Robbie immediately snapped his eyes up and said, ""Aye, sir.""

""I have worse news.  Yoivedrill accidentally received Pete's 'If you're reading this' last week,"" General George said, and the brothers winced as he continued, ""I already looked into it, the postmaster aboard the *Speaking Softly* discovered that in the rush to mobilize someone had simply bumped the envelope from the CNM slot, and someone replaced it in the slot for delivery instead.""

""Still, it must have ripped Yoive up,"" Sergeant George said through a lump in his throat.

The general nodded and dismissed his work from the display and instead fixed his oldest son with a steady, implacable stare.  ""Furthermore,"" he said, ""your refusal to acknowledge anything outside the immediate concerns of your command has no doubt blinded you to the fact that MH is taking a long, hard look at you.  If you had picked your nose up off of that grindstone you might have noticed that you have been leading combat operations for a year and somehow did not receive a promotion with that new stack of medals.  Put simply, I believe you are in danger of being involuntarily separated from service under a mental health medical.""

""But sir, they can't do that!"" Captain George balked.

""And why can't they do that?  Because you're a grandson of a famous hero and you have a legacy to uphold?  Because you're clearly being groomed for high command, maybe this command?  Because you perform your duties on the field with excellence?  They can and they will,"" the general said in that same unyielding tone that brooked no nonsense, ""What's more is I would not exercise my influence to alter that course of action if I could.  The Republic does not break her servicemen if she can help it, Johnny, and if we get broken anyway she does her best to make us whole again.""

Captain George opened his mouth to say something, decided against it, and closed his mouth again.

General George nodded solemnly and called up a hologram of the planet below, ""Somewhere down there, Pete's stuck.  Maybe hurt.  And we can't do a thing for him.  Instead we use what he got us.""

""Aye, sir."" the brothers choked.

""SAR Corps will find him, Pop,"" Captain George said.

""Of course they will,"" he answered, ""He's a George.  He was ordered specifically not to die.  Speaking of orders, the two of you will spend the next three shifts aboard the *Robin Williams* scrubbing the heads with the smallest brushes available.""

""But Pop, I'm an officer!"" Johnny objected.

""You may feel that you can take liberties with me since I am your father, but I remain the commanding officer of the Lost Boys, of which you are a member, and so you shall follow my orders.  Am I understood?""

""Aye, sir.""

""Can't I just take a few stripes at the post instead, sir?"" Sergeant George sighed.  His father stared at him in silence until he supplied himself, ""Of course not, no quick and easy way.  It was worth a shot anyway.""

""Dismissed.""

# Aboard the Speaking Softly in orbit above Azzaad:

Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Nelson Jock disliked the *Speaking Softly.*  Not that she was a bad ship by any means, far from it.  She was just not built as primarily a warship, but rather a center for diplomacy and coordination that can defend herself.  She was a political vessel with guns and a full squadron of destroyers in her hangar in case anybody decided to try politics by other means.  Admiral Jock was what in the days of wet navy would be called an old salt, and so he found such settings highly discomforting.  He had to keep focus to prevent his hackles from rising or his lips curling in a snarl on their own.  The fact that she was even here seemed a bit like tempting fate to the old salt, but then again the Republic was sending enough tonnage to not only glass the Axxaakk homeworld, creatively called Axxaakk, but to crack it to its core.  Which, admittedly would be the least desirable possible victory, hence the second most prestigious diplomatic vessel in the Republic fleets.  Of course, the most prestigious was the *We Sing,* and she drifted somewhere between the stars her keel sundered and her hull open to vacuum.  It was just as well, whether he liked her or not, since he was there to essentially do politics.

He had spoken to the ambassador from the Star Sailor Fleets, a woman he had known well before the outbreak of the war, and found her harder and stronger than he remembered.  Stronger and harder, but more brittle too.  He had gained her support almost at once, as his goal was a matter of honor to the Star Sailors.  It was a matter of honor to the Second Star RRG and the Lost Boys Special Operations Division too.  Admiral Amelia ""The Saw"" Ross would want to open up with orbital bombardment and drop a full two divisions of RNI troopers on the planet and hold the Lost Boys in reserve.  However Chief Admiral of the Republican Fleets ""Hail"" Marry McBride herself had ordered the entire flotilla to be at the rendezvous where they'd be reinforced, both in ships, crew, and RNI replacements.  That last item was by far the largest.  However, the enemy had opened hostilities by murdering a ship that was practically holy to the Lost Boys.  They deserved to be the first boots down, and the first fist to the face of the enemy.  By God and Creation he would put those boys on that planet if he had to go *through* Third Fleet to do it.

Pleasantly, he'd had the chance to see her children, which he hadn't had the opportunity for since the tragic day a year ago.  They were too young to have that look in their eyes, and it broke his heart to know that even the two young girls, six and ten years old, had looked death in the face.  It hurt less to see that look in her son, but he was very nearly a man by their reckoning, and already dead set on being the first of his people to enlist in the RNI and qualify for the Lost Boys.  As a Navy man, it was his obligation to at least poach such a motivated recruit, but the boy was immovable.  Good lad.

Small pleasures aside, he tried to get support from some of the flag officers in Third Fleet for his points, but they were impenetrable.  None of them wanted to be in the teeth of The Saw.  Third Fleet, the entire RRG, and the *Speaking Softly* all in the same operation.  There were some strong personalities involved.  Then again, weak wills do not carry flags in the Republican Navy.  He trod the lushly carpeted and finely paneled corridors like a stalking wolf, like a man on a mission until he found the crowded conference hall where the various flag officers were adding their ideas and suggestions to what would become the order of battle.  He was about to open the door when a solidly handsome human man called to him, ""Wait, a moment!""

Admiral Jock had to search his memory for a moment before he could place the man.  ""Ambassador,"" he said to Mikhail Volkov whose name he'd just recalled, ""Can I help you?""

""Yes.  I am thinking yes.  Though maybe not, but I wished to ask you as you are the one who might be able to be making this happen.""

Admiral Jock flicked his ears at the ambassador.

""Apologies, Admiral.  To explain, the Coalition was late in joining as a nation, but not as a people.  The first of us was charging in without even a plan they were so furious at what happened to the *We Sing,"" and I am not thinking it was I was nearly killed.  The ship, she is called the *Warp Speed Battle Wagon* now, and she joined up with the fleet of Roma Nova.  They are asking that I get this ship into the fighting with the first ships.  She has earned esteem from the Romans, and they consider her as good as one of their own ships, and in the Coalition we think she is being a ship of heroes.""

""I will see what I can do.""

""Sir, it is for our honor.""

""I understand, Ambassador.  I will see what I can do, but I can't promise you anything.""

""This is all we can ask of you.  Thank you for hearing,"" and with that, Ambassador Volkov nodded gravely and left.

The Romans.  Absolutely insane, but good in a fight, and punch well above their weight.  He'd have to point out that they can actually help in this operation.

Within there was bedlam.  Even though there was not a scrap of physical paper in the room, officers and staff were tossing holographic documents and files to each other via the holodesks so often that it looked like a paper storm.  Furthermore, there was the low hum of constant discussions, questions, clarifications, and queries that thrummed and buzzed in that somehow unified disharmony of many voices in a room speaking at once.  Indeed, the very air was thick with the scents of stale coffee, sweat, dander, bad breath, and cured meat sandwiches.  In short, it was a command center.   He walked right up to the large circular holotable dominating the center of the room where the men and women with stars on their collars and cuffs were gathered.  He studied the display, which seemed to be an amalgam of data take from the planet below and data taken from reconnaissance vessels skulking around the target system.  It seemed the enemy had very rudely decided to have heavy defenses at their seat of power and weren't very interested in just politely surrendering when the Republic showed up.  Pity.  The enemy only exists to be destroyed, and if they knew that they'd quit being the enemy.

Admiral Jock tapped the cardboard tube he'd brought with him against the palm of his free hand and waited.  ""Jock,"" Admiral Ross said without glancing down, ""good.  You're here.  Frankly SS RRG is one of our best formations.""  She showed him her teeth.  He did not rise to the bait.  He moved the end of the tube in a circular motion to indicate he was listening.  ""Much as it galls any fleet admiral to admit it.  So, I want you to drop in way out past the first asteroid field and wait to see where the fight is hottest.""

""No, I don't think we'll do that.  I think what we'll do is drop in at MSD and put our fucking boot in and drop the Lost Boys before they know what's happening.  Then, you bring the hammer down,"" Admiral Jock answered soberly.

""And why would we do that?"" Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Kai Watanabe asked pointedly.

""Because the RRG is not a slogger fleet.  The entire point of us is to be highly mobile, maneuverable, and fast.  And we are that.  We can damn near dogfight in our destroyers, and you all know it.  But that's not the only reason, but you know that too,"" Admiral Jock noted that nobody could hold his gaze when he met their eyes, except of course Admiral Ross and Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Benjamin Hughes.  Of course The Saw liked her own plan.

""I can think of reasons not to commit our best ships and RNI troopers at the onset of battle,"" Admiral Hughes said softly, ""First, because despite the fine work of our reconnaissance, we might be mistaken in our estimations of enemy strength, and might need the RRG or the Lost Boys fresh, or at least unbloodied.  Second, you may be rebuffed in your punch-through strategy, or be trapped against the planet once you do punch through by sheer weight of enemy numbers.  Third, your resolve to command under pressure is in question.""

""Did you, Admiral, just call me a coward?""  The room froze.

Admiral Hughes pretended not to notice and said, ""It is rumored that your resolve failed quite recently, Admiral.""

""You are welcome to test that rumor at your convenience.  Though I shall consider a third repetition cause to demand satisfaction, sir.""

Admiral Hughes raised an eyebrow and opened his mouth, but a look from Admiral Ross, he quieted.  Admiral Jock hated this posturing.  He'd have preferred to open with a challenge, but things simply were not done that way.  ""Alright, Nelson.  Say your piece.  Your *real* piece.  I admit, your tactical advice is sound, but riskier than I like.""

Admiral Jock uncapped the tube and drew forth a tightly furled flag.  He unrolled it across the holotable with a snap of void black fabric and its familiar devices drew every eye in the room.  ""Most people think that this banner has two stars on it.  I've even heard some CIPpie cups call it the twin suns banner.  This,"" here he tapped the larger of the two circles, the orange one with slivers of green at its edges, ""is not a star.  It's Ignitia.  Its people were wiped from the Republic by our own hands to stop the spread, and not a one girl or woman made it off of it alive.  The Lost Boys did.  This is where they came from, the terrible necessary evil that led to The Report eventually being accidentally adopted by the Star Sailors of the *Among the Star Tides We Sing.*  Their culture is all but forgotten, Third Reformed Creole only exists in snatches of nursery rhymes and half-remembered lullabies. But this, and the Lost Boys endure anyway.  And they desecrated the first home a Lost Boy found.  If you deny them their vengeance, I'll go right the fuck through you.""

""Fine.  Nelson, you're right.  It's a matter of honor, and if we don't put the Lost Boys boots down first, they'll never forgive us.  Hell, that might make a rift between us and the whole damn RNI,"" Admiral Ross admitted as if she was pulling teeth out of her skull through her toes.

""Now, the Romans are willing to take instructions for once, let's not waste that minor miracle,"" Admiral Jock said.  He left the flag there on the holotable.  It lay beneath the target like a waiting pit.

# Aboard the Jupiter's Might as she orbited above Azzaad:

The crew of the *Warp Speed Battle Wagon* was gathered around where fire flickered in two brazen bowls that cast a dancing light onto marble busts lined up in rows.  There was a new face among them now, and just like always, Marcus stood out.  Captain Lina Chen had insisted that the sculptors didn't give his pretty face a grimly stoic expression, and instead carved him as he lived, joyful.  He would have liked his bust, Captain Lina Chen thought.  The way the flickering light played on the marble made it almost look like he was laughing.  Captain Lina Chen liked that.  She was touched that the Romans counted him among their victorious dead.  They weren't so bad once you got to know them, still batshit insane, but basically good people.

""Last chance,"" she heard herself croak.  ""I don't know if I can pull the old rust bucket through this fight in one piece.  You sail with me in this fight, it might be your last.""

Nobody left.

""I need a-"" for some reason, Captain Lina Chen's throat was too tight to get the words out, and her cheeks were suddenly wet.  She stood in silence for a moment before forcing out, ""I need a first officer.""

Nobody volunteered.

""He left big shoe-"" she couldn't finish the sentence.  She should have let him marry her years ago.  ""But the job needs doing.  Don't make me beg.  Not in front of Marcus and his new friends.""

Hiroshi Tanaka, her navigator, stepped forward.  He didn’t say anything.  His set jaw and implacable gaze said everything clearly enough.

# On the surface of Azzaad:

Lieutenant Emely Sullivan looked at the holographic display of the portable holodesk in the base and tried to think like a wounded scout.  A wounded scout with a crippled child to protect from the kid's own murderous people.  It was not an exercise she relished.  His last known position had been fairly high up in a tall building overlooking a wide open area, but that position was hit by enemy artillery.  The Army didn't find a corpse in power armor in the rubble of that building.  Which didn't mean much, since it was stealth armor, not the assault model.  Which could make finding him tricky.

""I don't think we'll do much good helping pick through the building rubble here.  If he was here and alive, he would have figured out who holds this ground weeks ago.  So, he's got to have moved.  A sniper, and his position was compromised, but he had a… complication?""

""Liability,"" Specialist Alexei Petrov said bluntly, Emely winced, but Medtech Juan Hernandez and Medtech Jamal Watkins nodded gravely while Dr. Sarah Patel merely looked queasy.

""He's RNI.  He'll prioritize the injured civilian and try to evacuate as quickly as possible…"" Juan mused with eyes narrowed.  Structural compromise, he would have just picked up the kid and done a power armor sprint.""

""That explains finding his rifle,"" Dr. Patel said, ""but from what the other scouts said the kid had severe compound fractures in one leg being treated with a cast.  Better than nothing, but after this, the poor boy might need extensive corrective surgery.""

""We need to find him first,"" Jamal said.  ""Can you call up how the building stood before it collapsed?""

Emely did so, and she thought she was tracking with him, so she put in a call up the chain.  ""Cap, you have any clue how far an RNI stealth model Human pattern set of power armor can jump with a ninety foot running start?""

Captain Mark Ramirez, from his office where he was busy coordinating between teams on the ground replied over the coms, ""I think around half again as far as the rescue model?  They're not as heavy since they're not meant for sustained lifting and hauling, and ar- sorry rambling.  A man in a scout suit could clear impressive gaps if he times it well.

""So we should be looking here in this building,"" Alexei said, putting his finger through the building in question.  Is closest to side of building away from tilt, and trooper would be thinking ahead about not being crushed by building falling on him.""

""Do we know what floor he started on?"" Jamal asked.

""We start here, and search going down, we'll keep going subterranean even if we don't pick up a trail.  According to the file, this guy used the tunnel systems to move around pretty reliably, so he might have had a fallback in mind."" Emely said poking a floor of the building, ""Okay people, we don't have much time, and they have less.  Let's get moving.""

enough of the biography - here's the question. I travel (by plane) about one a month for work, sometimes a couple times. the trips are only 2 to 5 days, so not long. 

Do I need a Yerbera? Right now I use a ziploc bag, and sometimes I get free sample sizes from one of the places I order my maté from. I'm trying to decide if it's a frivolous expression of consumerism, or if it's something that will generally make my maté experience more enjoyable while traveling.

https://preview.redd.it/hiqxjj052ebe1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e50ceb4fedd57a867e8f20733951d2ce22375205

You've been sliding into our DMs for months asking for a more budget-friendly option that doesn't skimp on quality. Well, we've been listening! 🎧 Today, we're beyond excited to introduce the Novis Series - our most affordable gaming chair that still packs all the essential features you need for those epic gaming sessions.

**What Makes the Novis Series Special? 🌟**

Let's start with the biggest game-changer - the built-in lumbar support! 🎯 We've integrated a 5cm raised lumbar support that actually moves with your body. No more fumbling with external pillows or dealing with that weird floating feeling in your lower back. It's designed to follow your spine's natural curve, so whether you're leaning forward for an intense FPS match or sitting back to enjoy some RPG exploration, your back is always supported.

**Comfort That Actually Lasts 🛋️**

We know you're not just sitting for quick 30-minute sessions. That's why we've packed the Novis with:

* Premium 60kg/m³ cold-cure foam cushioning (the sweet spot between cloud-soft and properly supportive)
* 5cm raised seat edges that keep you stable without feeling restricted
* 155° recline range for those between-match breaks (or when you need to lean back and process that plot twist)
* 15° rocking mode - because sometimes you need to move during loading screens!
* Up-down adjustable armrests with a 7cm range to match your desk setup perfectly

**Size & Style Options 🎨**

We get it - one size doesn't fit all. That's why the Novis comes in:

* Two sizes: L and XL (detailed measurements below!)
* Two sleek colors: Classic Black and Ash Gray

https://preview.redd.it/2b44ksll2ebe1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada8d8d4643968de96382c860c18c8dc046c483d

* Two upholstery choices:
   * Premium PVC Napa leather (basically spill-proof - we've tested it with everything from coffee to energy drinks 😅)
   * Breathable linen fabric (for our friends who run hot during intense gaming sessions)

**The Technical Stuff (Because We Know You Care About the Details) 🔧**

* Seat Height Ranges:
   * Novis L: 44.5-54.5cm
   * Novis XL: 46-56cm
* BIFMA 5.1 certified heavy-duty tilt mechanism (yes, we actually got it properly tested!)
* SGS class 4 gas lift for smooth, reliable height adjustments
* Sturdy aluminum base that won't wobble after months of use

**Optional Upgrades for Extra Comfort 🆙**

Want to take your comfort to the next level? We've designed a special pillow bundle featuring:

* Memory foam head pillow with soft-touch flannel cover
* Perfectly sized for both L and XL models
* Elastic straps for easy positioning
* Extra lumbar pillow for those who like additional lower back support

**The Real Talk Corner 💬**

Look, we know gaming chairs can get expensive. With the current economy, dropping premium chair money isn't always feasible. But we also believe that taking care of your back shouldn't be a luxury. The Novis Series is our solution to this - we've focused on the features that really matter for long-term comfort and durability, while keeping the price accessible.

**Built to Last 💪**

We didn't just make this affordable - we made it durable. The Novis features:

* Industrial-grade base materials
* Color-fast upholstery that won't fade
* Easy-clean surfaces (because real life happens)
* Rigorously tested components
* Same warranty coverage as our premium lines

**Have Questions? We're Here! 🤝**

Drop your questions below! I'll be actively monitoring this thread to answer anything you want to know about the Novis Series. Want specific measurements? Curious about the weight capacity? Need to know if it'll fit your setup? Ask away!

*Pro tip: Keep an eye on our website this week - we might have some special launch deals coming* 😉

**TL;DR: We made a budget-friendly chair that doesn't feel budget. Your back (and wallet) will thank you!**",1,1736176148.0,gamingchairs,0,1.0,False

But for as much as I love you. I wish I never met you. 

A window into the life I could’ve had. I just had to play it safe. I just had to get it right one time. You were my chance. You were my only chance. And I blew it. 

We’re on good terms. I’m glad. I love talking to you. But it’s a knife. And you slice me with it with every word you speak.

You’ll never ask if I want to travel with you. Or if  we could get a cup of coffee together. Or if we could just hang out. 

I could ask. I could do it right now. And part of me really, really wants to. Maybe it’s different now. Maybe you’d say yes. 

But I can’t. I just can’t. 

I love you so much. And now, to prove it. I have to lay back and just let life happen. I have to let you slip away. Just for a chance of you coming back. 

Was I born to lose? Even if I picked myself back up. Even if I rebuilt the pieces. What’s the point. I won’t forget you. Not anytime soon. And anything else would just pale in comparison. 

Maybe I just don’t deserve that paradise. So I look through a window. A ‘what-if’. Because I’d rather be anywhere but here. 

I hope other me’s had better luck. I hope another me found his way to you. I hope he’s happy. I hope he never looked back. And I hope he never for a second takes you for granted.

You’re close. So close. It’s so close. But you’ll never be there. You just never will. I won’t have faith in something that’ll just let me down every second of every day. 

If you ever do change your mind. You know where to find me. 

But until then. My life will be on hold. And if you never come around.

1hv11sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1hv11sl/fixing_my_relationship_with_sexuality/,Fixing my relationship with sexuality,"TLDR at the end

I (25F) figure my situation has at least a little something to do with my combination of religious upbringing, forming an identity around purity/innocence at a young age (I don't swear even as an adult. I'd probably have started in recent years but my bf says he hates hearing me swear and gets all upset when I even use one when quoting something). I still feel unbelievably uncomfortable discussing sex - refused to bring it up in therapy a few years back, even when I figured it was relevant. Writing it is a bit easier. 

The first time I ever had sex (which was with my current partner- we've both only been with each other), it was excruciating. I was the one who initiated, and we were using lots of lube. The second time, same thing. Every attempt at PIV sex hurts - every time he pushes farther in, it's a feeling like banging your toe on a coffee table. After pushing through the pain long enough, it eventually stops hurting and just becomes uncomfortable. Neither of us has ever finished from penetration. A friend said she had a similar situation, and that it resolved itself by the tenth attempt. I'm sure everyone here will probably be horrified to hear we've had maybe 6 attempts - ever - in over 5 years. After attempt 6 of excruciating sex, my body seemed to hate it so much that it started defensively clenching so hard it hurts every time I'm even a little turned on. That means that now I can't even do non-penetration stuff. I can't even masturbate because getting turned on is instant discomfort. 

My partner has been incredibly patient and supportive. All the potential treatments sound so scary to me (from least to most terrifying: therapy where I *have* to talk about all this out loud, dilators I'd have to use on myself regularly, a pelvic physiotherapist feeling *inside* of me to check the muscles). Maybe this stuff doesn't sound so bad to others, but I've only ever felt things ranging from uncomfortable to horribly painful from touching myself or being touched. Grinding with my partner works for me (or... It did before getting turned on started hurting) but either of us using hands, the one time he tried oral on me - just uncomfortable at best. Probably because we only went for any of that a couple of times *because* it wasn't good....  

So - anyone else been here? I've scheduled intake at talk therapy for next week. When I asked my doctor about it last year she said it sounds like vaginismus and prescribed the pelvic floor physio but that was both way too expensive and too terrifying. Anything else that could help? From posts here I'm just so scared of my partner moving on. He says not to worry about him, he's ok - but he admitted that no, he wouldn't be ok with no sex ever. Obviously... And I don't just fear losing him, hate that *I* feel cursed to never be able to enjoy sex... Help? 


TL;DR: Vaginismus has evolved into ""I can't even get turned on without pain"" - advice for feeling more comfortable around sex to hopefully reduce that? ",3,1736175916.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

The resulting AMA can be a bit tricky to read, so here it's been cleaned up a bit and arranged in a more linear format, with each answer immediately following its question, and all sorted by category in a way that should hopefully be easier to read.

Due to length, this will be two reddit posts. This first post will mostly cover future publications and adaptations, and other out of universe topics.

The second post will cover in-universe questions.

# Part One - Future Works

**Writing More Books**

> **Do you have a planned number of books in Alagaësia in mind?**  
> *I'll be writing in this world until the day I die.*  
> **I love this, but also feel bad because if that truly happens then there will never be a true conclusion to the story/world which could kind of be a bummer.**  
> *If it makes you feel better, I'm a firm believer in stories having proper endings. So even though I may keep writing books in the world, they'll be grouped by subject/character/and storyline, so that you WILL get some proper conclusions.*

> **Are you concerned about losing the air of mystery and ""magic"" that came with the Inheritance Cycle? Is there any worry that as you expand this world and offer explanations for things that people didn't necessarily want an explanation for, you'll lose some of that mystery and ""magic""?**  
> *If I ever lose that sense of mystery and magic ... I'll stop writing. It's a large part of why I love fantasy, and I want to keep it as much as possible.*

**Illustrated Eldest**

> *There's an illustrated edition of Eldest being developed right now (much like the illustrated edition of Eragon that came out last year).*

> **Is it true an illustrated edition of eldest will come out?**  
> *Yup! I've already seen the first round of sketches for it. Super cool stuff.*

> **Are there any plans to release the rest of the series as the illustrated editions? I got the illustrated edition last year and love it and would love the others in the same format!**  
> *Yup! We're working on the illustrated edition of Eldest right now. I've already seen the preliminary sketches for the art. It's going to be amazing!*

**Murtagh 2**

> **When I was younger, the Roran parts of Eldest were a struggle to read. Why care about some farmer with a hammer when magic and elves and kings are interacting on the other side of the world? Now that I'm older, I think it was brilliant to force the reader back down to touch grass and view the world from a uniquely driven, but otherwise mundane protagonist. Do you still think it's important to use this style of perspective in your writing?**  
> *Glad you like Roran now! Yes, I think it's super important to have his sort of perspective in a story ... and I'm looking forward to writing it again!*

> **How is Roran doing in his retirement? And will we see him again?**  
> *Roran is about to be pulled out retirement. . . .*

> **Will we get more Roran content?**  
> *Yes.*

> **Can you please confirm or disconfirm that we will at some point get a scene with both Roran and Murtagh?**  
> *Confirmed.*

**Naegling**

> **Will we see Naegling in future books? And possibly someone abuse the amount of energy stored in it?**  
> *Yes. I have an entire story/book planned about Naegling.*

**Baby Saphira Picture Book**

> **I know your friend Brandon Sanderson just had a children's book come out, and it did very well. My wife and I recently welcomed our first child into the world, and I have been trying to collect as many awesome, nerdy baby/children's books as I can get for her, is there any chance you might put out Alagaësia themed or set children's books?**  
> *I'd love to. I've been meaning to write a picture book about baby Saphira for years. Maybe I can get to it in '25.*

**Book Six**

> **What did the Menoa tree take from Eragon as the price for the Brightsteel?**  
> *Book 6!*

**Brom**

> **Any thoughts of doing some prequel stories? Would love to read about the riders in their heyday and the threats they stood against.**  
> *Yup! I'd love to do a prequel from Brom's POV.*

**Eragon/Arya**

> **Will Eragon’s story be continued?**  
> *His story will be continued*

> **I believe I once saw that you mentioned a book for Arya and Eragon after Murtagh… is that still the direction you plan on going?**  
> *Yup, still in the works.* 

> **Will Eragon and Arya get their happy ending together?**  
> *No comment! :D*

**Two Passing Strangers**

> **In Brisingr, you drew great attention to a tanned, scarred woman and her seeming protégé, a strong-armed teenage girl. I’ve heard elsewhere that this was to be the first appearance of major characters in later stories you would write. Are we allowed to know the names of these characters yet?**  
> *Ha! No, no names at the moment. And yes, I still need to write about them! Soon, I hope.*

> **Will the story about the two passing strangers be set parallel to the Inheritance Cycle or afterwards?**  
> *Parallel.*

**Adult Books**

> **Do you set out to create YA friendly stories? Would you ever venture into an adult-oriented Alagaësia story? I love your works and Brandon Sanderson because they’re not riddled with unnecessary sex and explicit language. I’m here either way but was just curious if it was your intent or if you’re just writing the story from the heart, and it happens to be a little more PG13 than R.**  
> *All I ever try to do is write the best version of each story I'm trying to tell. I don't worry about it being YA or adult. In fact, I'd argue that Murtagh could easily be shelved in the adult fantasy section.*

**Companion Books**

> **Are you planning on making companion books for the world of Alagaësia? Something to develop and show more of the world, possibly including art depictions of it?**  
> *Yes, I have lots of plans and projects in the works.*

**Other Authors**

> **You mentioned in a previous comment that you plan to write in the world until the day you die. Have you had any thoughts on one day taking on an apprentice to continue your work once your gone so the world continues to live on? Or is that just so far ahead you’ve never even given it thought?**  
> *Maybe, but at the moment, I really want to maintain full control over my worlds.*

**Leatherbounds**

> **You said a leatherbound set of the Inheritance Cycle would something you’d love to do. Have you ever considered doing something like the wraithmark partnership with a person or group that specializes in rebinding books? I bet many would pay for a full set. I don’t have the skill myself and I’d love for an official set.**  
> *Wraithmarked and I have a TON of plans. . . . And that's all I can say on that at the moment. However, with the success of the kickstarter, we're feeling very confident about our next projects.*

**Merchandise**

> **Did you ever find a proper producer of custom globes (even if just for yourself)?**  
> *Alas, no. If anyone finds one they think would work, send 'em my way!*

> **Any plans for more collectibles after Saphira's insane success? Would love seeing more of the dragons and characters**  
> *Probably not. We were only able to do this kickstarter because of a brief gap in the rights situation between me and Disney/Fox. Assuming the TV show goes into full production, I won't be able to do any more merch like this. So this really is a one-time opportunity to get a statue that I personally oversaw.*

**Fractalverse**

> **I really enjoyed To Sleep in a Sea of Stars and Fractal Noise. I feel like they're a beautiful blend of sci-fi and fantasy. Are you planning on writing more stories in that universe?**  
> *Of course! I have as many books planned in the Fractalverse as I do in the World of Eragon.*

**To Sleep Sequel**

> *There is a direct sequel to To Sleep coming. I just have to write it!*

**Patterns of Meaning**

> *I'm currently working on a sixty page essay on some of the science and tech of the Fractalverse (my sci-fi setting) right now.*


# Part Two - Adaptations

**News**

> **Will we get a show update in 2024? Or 2025?**  
> *'24, I hope. It's imminent. Or at least, that's my impression.*

> **Any updates regarding the live-action series (or even on when we might expect to get news about it)? It's the number-one thing I'm looking forward to, haha.**  
> *Update should be coming out soon from Disney. At least, that's my impression.*

> **How is the Disney+ Eragon series going?**  
> *Going well so far.*

> **I hope the supposedly TV show for To Sleep in a Sea of Stars does justice for the books and I am looking forward to it.**  
> *Fingers crossed for the To Sleep TV show. We've had some good movement on that front. Hoping to have some news by early next year. We shall see.*


**Showrunner Search**

> **What are some of the major challenges associated with getting the show going?**  
> *Finding the right personnel has been the biggest challenge so far. However, I think we've cracked that particular nut.*

**Creative Input**

> **Are you able to tell us how much input you're going to have on the show? For example, are you going to/have you been involved with casting, story revisions, visual styles etc.**  
> *So far I've had a HUGE amount of input on every part and stage of the show. We'll see if that continues, but it's the complete opposite of my earlier experience. If you didn't know, I'm both producing and co-writing the series.*

**Visuals**

> **Visuals in books is often something that's tricky, as each person will already have their own personal take on it, so how much do you even WANT to be involved with visuals? Would you rather see what other people come up with based on your work?**  
> *I would love to have complete control over the visuals. Lol. Failing that, I'll give as much advice and pointers as I can to those working on the show along with me.*

**Changes**

> **I know you won't be able to talk about a lot of it, but can you talk about your experience a bit on how adapting the book to a script is going? A common refrain amongst fans when their favorite works get adapted to the screen is ""Why are they changing things!?"" But any reasonable person understands that things HAVE to be changed to a degree. Your POV is, of course, interesting as the original author and one of the people helping to adapt it.**  
> *The biggest challenge is finding ways to make things that are otherwise internal (like thoughts and feelings) external and VISUAL. Also, shows and films are paced differently than books. However, I'm working with some great collaborators, and so far, it's been a great experience. Night and day compared with the film that doesn't exist.*

**Episodes**

> **Regarding the Disney+ series… What do you think is the ideal breakdown of episodes/episode length per book? 12 hour-long episodes per book, more episodes for the later books, etc. and why?**  
> *Given that most of the Disney+ shows have about 10 episodes per season, I'm guessing that's where we would end up.*


**The Movie**

> **What was your honest opinion of the Eragon movie and what level of input did you have in it? If it was less than you'd like what would you have changed or if it was more than you liked how was the workload?**  
> *What movie? Lol. . . . I had basically zero input, and it was NOT what I would have done.*


> **What changes would you have made to the Eragon movie if you could now**  
> *Everything.*

> **Thoughts on the movie adaption?**  
> *Movie? What movie? Lol.*

> **How do you feel about the movie adaptation of Eragon?**  
> *There was a movie?*

**New Movies**

> **If you could only pick one of these books (including Murtagh) to be turned into a new movie, which would you pick and why?**  
> *I'd pick the Worm of Kulkaras to turn into a movie. It could be AWESOME!*

**HTTYD**

> **How do you feel about the live adaptation for How to Train your Dragon, and are you (or the mouse) worried about how it will affect the Eragon shows reception?**  
> *The more dragons the better!*

**Video Games**

> **Have you thought about doing a video game set in Alagaësia?**  
> *I'd love to, but the rights are owned by Disney/Fox.*

**Alagaësia Adventure Game**

> **On alagaesia.com there was this text adventure that I was obsessed with as a kid. Does that still exist somewhere?**  
> *No idea. I know what you're talking about, but I haven't been able to track it down. If anyone finds it for me, I could see about getting it back up. . . .*

**New Audiobooks**

> **Are there any plans to ever redo the audiobooks for the original series? I struggle with the interpretation of the dragon voices.**  
> *Maybe someday, but not any time soon. Overall Gerard did a wonderful job reading the series.*



# Part Three - Writing the Books


**Publishing Eragon**

> **How far in the story and world of Eragon did you have built for after that first book?**  
> *I worked out the entire plot of the series before starting Eragon. In fact, if you re-read the first book, you may notice that one of the fever dreams Eragon has after dragging Garrow to Carvahall describes the last scene in Inheritance.*

> **Considering that your publisher family members got you published, have you ever attempted submitting any books under a pseudonym? Or are you relying exclusively on nepotism for your career?**  
> *Lol. Considering that my family's publishing business consisted of me and my parents sitting around a kitchen table in the middle of Montana with absolutely no contacts with the larger publishing world ... no. We self-published Eragon with no idea what we were doing. Fortunately for us, people actually enjoyed reading the book, which is all that Random House cared about when they decided to buy and release the Inheritance Cycle.*

> **I know you started writing at a really young age, what was the beginning process like of getting your first book published?**  
> *Over the years, I've written/talked fairly extensively about the process of getting published. I recommend looking up some of those articles and essays.*

**Eragon Regrets**

> **You were quite young when you originally wrote Eragon. Anything notable the older and more experienced you would have done differently?**  
> *Lots of things. On a line-by-line basis, I think I'm a much better writer these days. There are also more pieces of deep lore that I would want to thread into the background of the first book.*

> **Are there any particular bits of lore or worldbuilding that have come bite you in the ass later?**  
> *Not really. I did a lot of prep work before starting the first book. I just wish I had been able to weave in a couple more pieces of deep lore in volume one.*

> **If there was one thing you could go back and change or add to one of your books, what would it be?**  
> *Hmm. There are a lot of lines I'd like to rewrite, and some deep lore I'd like to thread into the first two books, but mostly, I wish I'd added a chapter from Nasuada's POV showing how the Varden got from Farthen Dûr to Surda.*

> **Do you ever look back at your earlier novels and wish you could make them a bit more mature - not in theme, but in general quality?**  
> *Oh, I've seriously debated going back and re-editing Eragon. However, I think my time is better spent writing new books. If you'd like to see how my prose as evolved over the years (hopefully for the best), I'd recommend picking up Murtagh and/or one of my sci-fi books.*


**Inheritance Ending**

> **The ending of Inheritance seems rushed to me, was it a time constraint issue?**  
> *I think that's a subjective response. Some readers feel that I dragged out the ending faaar longer than I should have. Ultimately, I wrote the ending that made the most sense to me. And Inheritance is by FAR the largest book in the series.*

> **Are there any points in the story you could share, that almost took an alternate path? Like some scrapped writing decision that would have had a huge ripple effect if you went with it. Maybe killing off an important character at some point, or a completely scrapped character, some ancient remnant of the dragons and elves that you decided against, etc.**  
> *Hmm. Well, I originally planned to kill Murtagh and Thorn in Inheritance! Which, I'm really glad I changed my mind. Lol.*


**Rewriting To Sleep**

> **Do you outline, or are you a “pantser”? And how much time do you spend revising vs writing a first draft typically?**  
>*Huge outliner. Outlining is the only reason I can write a first draft relatively quickly. Murtagh, for example, only took me three and a half months because I had a very clear idea of the underlying structure. By contrast, I didn't have that with To Sleep in a Sea of Stars ... and that book took me nearly seven years to finish up. I often spend as much time as editing/revising as I do writing, even if the first draft is in good shape. It can always be better!*

> **Oh hey, I'm currently listening to your book ""To Sleep in a Sea of Stars"" on Audible. Good stuff! I was surprised by its length though. How long did it take you to write, and how much did it change from the initial draft?**  
> *Seven years to write, rewrite, and edit that monster. However, it only took that long because I started with an outline that wasn't particularly successful. Live and learn. When plotting To Sleep, I always thought of it as an entire series in one novel, which is why it's so long.*

**Growth**

> **What was the biggest lesson you learned between finishing Inheritance and starting Murtagh?**  
> *I* \**relearned*\* *the importance of structure, especially as it relates to character.*

> **How do you feel your approach to writing has changed over the years, if at all?**  
> *I've gotten a lot, LOT more organized and disciplined with plotting and worldbuilding. I really can't write a decent book if I don't know where it's going.*

> **Do you feel like your books have gone up in quality as you've continued to write the Eragon series?**  
> *I certainly hope so! I've spent a lot of time writing, editing, and trying to improve my craft.*

**Fantasy**

> **How do you feel the landscape of fantasy changed since you were starting out?**  
> *It's a lot more varied. And a LOT larger. So many more people read fantasy now than back in the 90s. It's pretty awesome to see. That said, there's still a dearth of really good fantasy films. I hope to address that someday.*

> **Do you feel like you’ve majorly impacted the fantasy genre? Your work certainly has left that deep mark on me, but I never really kept up with the writing field and took note of whether the landscape has been shaped by it.**  
> *As for whether I've had much of an impact on the fantasy genre ... hard to say. I know that Eragon introduced a lot of readers to the genre, so in that sense, maybe it helped boost people's interest in writing more of it. I don't think I'm a good judge of the impact the books may or may not have. Better for other people to judge that, I think.*

# Part Four - Writing Advice

**Worldbuilding and Outlining**

> **Can you provide some things a starting writer should know in regards to drafting a fantasy novel as well as what was your resources and framework?**  
> *Have fun and try to be consistent! Writing, plotting, and worldbuilding are just a process of asking and then trying to answer those questions as honestly as possible. I highly recommend the worldbuilding books by Marie Brennan.*

> **You wrote Eragon when you were pretty young. As a young, college-age aspiring fantasy author myself, what advice would you give?**  
> *Plot your stories out before writing them, and make sure you have a good idea what every scene is supposed to be doing. Also, it really, really helps to know what your character(s) emotional and physical journey is before starting. Assuming you're writing a story where the main character(s) actually changes vs. something like Poirot, who doesn't.*

> **I’m a struggling writer and outlining is literally something that only occurred to me that I could do recently. Do you have any advice for outlining? How detailed are your outlines?**  
> *Very detailed. Go read ""Story"" by McKee. It's a great look at the technical aspects of plotting.*

> **You said you're a huge outliner but does that go for a small foreshadowing such as small information in book 3 that wouldn't come to fruition until end of book 4 (just an example)?**  
> *Yes, outlining seriously helps with foreshadowing (among many other things).*

> **How do you know when you’re ready to move from conceptualizing and outlining, to writing a first draft?**  
> *When I understand most of the ways that the world/setting differs from the real world, and when I understand the characters and their physical and emotional journey well enough to explain it to someone in a coherent and effective way. If not, then I don't actually have a story, and I'll be trying to plot and/or worldbuild while also writing, and that never works well for my brain.*

**Character Voice**

> **Do you have any advice for improving character ""voice"" and distinction in a draft without overdoing it for minor characters? The beta readers for my current project have pointed out that the minor characters all feel and sound similar, but my attempts to vary them have fallen a bit flat. I also quickly learned that adding accents randomly does not do the trick! This was a painful lesson; many ""Ayes"" and ""lads"" were suffered by my betas.**  
> *There's nothing wrong with approaching dialogue/voice with a pragmatic, pre-planned approach. Pick a couple of verbal ticks/irregularities for each character that you want to distinguish and try to devise one or two unique ways of thinking for each of them. That should do the trick. If your ""ayes"" and ""lads"" were failing, it's likely because they didn't feel like a natural part of the characters' dialect, and they probably did nothing to alter how the characters actually view the world (which will of course shape how they speak). More reading will help.*

**Editing**

> **Do you write the whole story first and then edit? Or write like chapter then edit etc.?**  
> *Write then edit (unless there's a massive problem that needs fixing before I continue with the story).*

**Persistence**

> **When you are going through the writing process, what ends up stalling you the most and how do you overcome it?**  
> *Whenever I lose track of what a scene is supposed to be doing ... I stall out. Also, if a project drags on for more than three months, it becomes increasingly hard for me to maintain my initial energy/enthusiasm.*

> **Besides luck and an indomitable will unbroken by the soul-processing gauntlet of breaking into the publishing industry, what common element do you see in successful authors?**  
> *Persistence (which you touched on) and a desire to write stories that people actually want to read. Doesn't hurt if you can learn to love promotion as well, or at least learn to be decent at it.*

> **What’s the best advice about writing you’ve received?**  
> *Best advice is don't give up! And don't get discouraged if you write something that needs editing/revision.*

**Publishing**

> **In a world of increasing digitization, self-publishing is becoming more prevalent. As a traditionally published author, what would you say are the reasons for a new author to pursue traditional publication? (Or, alternatively, is self-publishing really the new way forward?)**  
> *Traditional publishing is awesome if you're lucky enough to sell a lot of books. Publishers can do a TON for you that would otherwise take an enormous amount of time and money on your part. That said, lots of folks are making a good living self-publishing these days. You just have to be willing to do a lot of promotion. Personally, I really enjoy working with Random House and Tor.*

# Part Four - Inspirations

> **Who would you say your biggest influence(s) is? I can detect LeGuin, McCaffery, Jordan, and Tolkien.**  
> *All those save Jordan. Also I'd say E. R. Eddison, David Eddings, Feist, Tad Williams, and Octavia Butler.*

> **Did you ever get any sort of inspiration from the Holy Bible when writing the Inheritance Cycle?**  
> *At times. It's a foundational work of Western literature. Anyone writing fiction in English ought to be familiar with it, if for no other reason than to know where so many other authors have drawn their inspiration.*

**Magic**

> **What if anything inspired your creation of Eragon's magic system (the ancient language) and its many uses in the series.**  
> *True Names appear throughout mythology (and some more modern fantasy, such as the Wizard of Earthsea). All of that served as inspiration. In terms of the words themselves, I was specifically inspired by Old Norse, which gave the language a nice sound and feel.*

**Dragon Riders**

> **What was your inspiration for the Dragon Riders? I’m sure you’ve heard the comparisons to the Jedi Order, but I also see some D&D “Gish” influence.**  
> *The Dragon Riders of Pern was a huge inspiration (and yes, the Jedi also).*

**Tronjheim**

> **Why did you go into so much detail with that dwarven mountain crater city?**  
> *Because it's COOL! Ahahaha!*

**Roran**

> **The Roran storyline in Eldest is one of the best “B-plots” I’ve ever read in a novel. And Roran himself is an incredibly compelling character! Did something in particular (a lightbulb moment, a discussion with someone, a book you read, etc) inspire his narrative, or did it come together gradually?**  
> *I was just trying to write an ordinary man (if one with EXTREMELY high levels of determination) in a world of extraordinary magic. No other inspiration besides that.*

> **Did you, at any point in the writing of Eragon, consider giving Roran the ability to use magic? If so, what made you stop?**  
> *I did, and I stopped because I wanted to have a couple of main characters who couldn't use magic. The tension between magicians and non-magicians is a major theme and storyline in the series. Giving Roran magic would have undercut that.*

**Murtagh**

> **I haven’t finished Murtagh yet, but so far I have been very impressed by how well he is portrayed as a survivor of such severe trauma. Did you do a lot of research on PTSD or other trauma-related disorders while writing it?**  
> *No, no real research aside from the process of sitting and thinking and imagining what it would be like to live Murtagh's life.*

> **What was the process of writing Murtagh and Thorn's relationship in this book as opposed to Eragon and Saphira's (and/or during the Inheritance cycle), especially with how different Thorn's upbringing was to Saphira's (plus the small time-skip after Inheritance)?**  
> *Won't lie -- it took some work to get their relationship right. I think I managed about 80% of it on the first draft, and the last 20% was in revisions. Mostly, I needed to focus on their different personalities and different backgrounds compared with Eragon and Saphira.*

# Part Five - Other Out of Universe Questions


> **How are you doin my man? Just in life in general.**  
> *Pretty darn good. Need some more sleep, though. :D*

> **What’s a perfect (creative) day look like for ya? What beverage is within arm’s reach? You a early bird, or spooky late night wraith?**  
> *Lots of sleep, lots of coffee, no major distractions, a well-plotted story waiting to be written, and snow softly falling outside.*

> **Are you personally addicted to anything? Coffee, nicotine, sugar? What's your weakness?**  
> *Coffee, but I'm not addicted. I can give it up at any time (and I have). The only two things I'm addicted to are writing and exercise, and I could walk away from both of those things if I needed to. I try to avoid addictions as a rule. (which is why I stopped playing Minecraft)*


**Writing Routine**

> **Could you give us a glimpse into what your writing process looks like as you craft your books, please? Do you outline your novels before starting to write, or do you discover the story as you write? Do you always know where the story is ""going"" before you begin to write, or does the plot sometimes evolve over the course of writing?**  
> *Writing process is: think of a scene or set-up I'd like to write about. Tear out my hair building out the plot and world. Once the outline is solid ... WRITE. Then tear out hair while editing. After that, touring and promotion. There's always some discovery in the writing, but I really like having a solid map beforehand.*

> **With you writing multiple books, working on the show, and family life, how do you balance your time? What techniques or strategies do you use for your time management?**  
> *There is no balance (which is why I'm answering AMA questions at nearly 8pm). I just try to get enough time with my family, as well as some exercise in every day. That's all I can really do as far as relaxation goes.*

> **What is your writing routine like? How many hours do you write a day, or do you set yourself word counts as goals?**  
> *All day every day ... aside from family obligations, email, calls with employees, promotional activities, feeding the dog, cleaning the house, exercise, and all of the other things that need doing. Lol.*

> **What helps you get in the right headspace to write?**  
> *A good piece of music. Especially movie soundtracks.*

> **What sort of keyboard are you clackin’ on?**  
> *If you're curious about my keyboard, boy do I have the video for you! https://youtu.be/d7m46HisRj8*



**Reading**

> **You mentioned that you can read with an internal narrator or without; I used to be able to read very quickly, and without one, but ever since I learned about that, I haven't been able to get the narrator out of my head, and my reading has slowed down to a narrator's pace. Can you tell me the secret to reading fast again?**  
> *You have to force yourself to read faster. At a certain point, your brain will snap and abandon the narrator. That said, the narrator isn't a bad thing, and it can even be a real benefit when reading beautiful prose.*

> **Eragon was the first book I read as a kid that I absolutely couldn’t put down until I finished. What book gave you that experience?**  
> *Lots and lots of books. It's why I was drawn to writing in the first place. Dune, the Wizard of Earthsea trilogy, the Belgariad; Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn; and many others were my gateway drugs.*

> **Have you ever read the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix, if so what did you think about it?**  
> *One of my all-time favorites. I feel like it ought to be spoken of more often. LOVE those books.*

> **What are the best recent (<10-15 years) books you read, especially in fantasy or sci-fi?**  
> *I've read far too few books over the past few years because of work and life. Project Hail Mary was great fun, and I remember enjoying A Natural History of Dragons quite a lot.*

> **What was your favorite book you read this year?**  
> *Alas, I haven't been able to read much this year. Too much work and life stuff with kids.*

> **Who are your favorite modern authors and what are some of their works you recommend?**  
> *I'm woefully behind on my reading, so I feel unqualified to answer this at the moment.*

> **No questions per se, but curious as to what books you're enjoying reading now-a-days?**  
> *Currently re-reading The Dragonbone Chair (first time in twenty years). However, I don't really have time for reading these days. Too busy with work and family.*

> **What are you reading on your free time that's got you excited?**  
> *Nothing at the moment. I'll let you know when I get some free time! I really want to re-read Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn so I can catch up on Tad's newest Osten Ard books.*  
> **How excited are you about The Navigator’s Children? I’m almost done with it, and it rules.**  
> *VERY excited.*

**Watching / Playing**

> **As a Montanan, where do you land on Norman Maclean's ""A River Runs Through It""? Either the film or the novella.**  
> *Confession time: I've never read nor watched the film. I know, I know. One of these days.*

> **Have you seen D&D: Honor Among Thieves? If so, what was your opinion?**  
> *Not yet! Want to, though.*

> **Have you ever played a MUD/text game called Achaea?**  
> *I haven't, sorry! I've pretty much given up gaming since my daughter was born. Just no time at the moment. Maybe one of these days. . . .*

**Favorites**

> **If you could have dinner with three characters from the World of Eragon, who would they be?**  
> *Saphira, Elva, and Brom.*

> **Who’s your all time favorite character you’ve written?**  
> *Favorite characters would be: Saphira, Elva, Gregorovich, and Murtagh.*

> **What was your favorite part of Murtagh to write?**
> *The underwater scenes with Muckmaw and after. Also the last couple of chapters.*

> **What is your favorite sword/knife in your collection?**  
> *Favorite knife? Too many to choose, but I'm very fond of my Buck 117 in S35VN and my Buck 110 in Magnacut.*

> **What is your favorite comic book?**  
> *Bone, Midnight Nation, and Kill Six Billion Demons (webcomic, but I think it counts).*

> **You're trapped on a deserted island with three books. Knowing that you will be reading them over and over and over again, what three do you bring?**  
> *That's such a hard question . . . It's more than one volume, but the complete Oxford English Dictionary. The collected works of Shakespeare. And . . . the Wizard of Earthsea trilogy.*

> **Who is your favorite non-fiction author and why?**  
> *Not sure if I have one!*


**Touring**

> **I met you way back at a signing event you held at a zoo/park near Phoenix AZ back in 2008 or 2009 (I think).**  
> *I remember that! The zoo gave me a hair off one of their elephants. Super cool event.*

> **Will any of your future book tours ever include Iceland? Don't get me wrong, I'd love to travel abroad to meet you and get my books signed, but that is going to be quite a lot more expensive than just showing up to a bookstore.**  
> *I'd love to visit Iceland! Never been there.*

> **Any chance you'd be coming to the UK, Edinburgh any time this year?**  
> *Not this year, no. I was there last year, and I spent over 55 days on the road in '23. I'm looking at cutting down on my touring moving forward so that I can write more books.*

> **48 year old grandpa here. Please I need the next book.**

She was someone who lived with passion, curiosity, and an unyielding drive to make the world a better place. They were a master’s student in social work, specializing in policy, advocacy, and reform—work that wasn’t just a career path but a calling. Their efforts as an editor for the human rights clinic newsletter and their deep dedication to social justice left a legacy of compassion, critical thought, and powerful storytelling.

But beyond their professional accomplishments, she was someone who understood the quiet beauty of life’s early mornings, with coffee in hand before the world woke up. They treasured the space to reflect, to work, or to simply *be*. That time of day was where their ideas bloomed, where they found clarity, and where their heart rested before diving into the challenges of the world.

She had an insatiable love for learning and writing. Whether they were poring over government archives, creating content for their blog on mental health and addiction, or offering thoughtful feedback on PhD dissertations, they approached each endeavor with meticulous care and a genuine desire to connect with others. They believed in the power of words to heal, to challenge, and to inspire.

More than anything, she was a deeply empathetic soul. They knew that life is complicated and messy and met everyone with grace, understanding, and a willingness to help. Their presence was a source of strength and comfort to so many—an unwavering advocate for justice and a champion of human dignity.

Today, we remember their warmth, their brilliance, and the laughter they shared with us. We honor the way they embraced life’s imperfections while always striving for something greater. And we carry forward the lessons they taught us: to lead with kindness, to seek truth, and to never stop growing.

Friday, my principal called me while I was driving home from a professional development day. He informed me that the staff would be doing a dyslexia training on Monday morning. I had seen the schedule and realized I had already done the training last year at my old school.

He called to let me know that since I had completed the training, I didn’t need to attend again. I’m currently working from home with coffee and will join the group later today for the rest of the professional development.

In search of a genuine connection, so let me share a little bit about myself! I’m 33 years of age, an Aries, from the wonderful Southern California. I work in banking for one of America’s top banks, and have been in the industry for close to 9 years. I’m 5’9”, divorced with zero kids, Hispanic, with a pierced nose and one arm and one leg full of tattoos. In my free time I enjoy resting; nap anyone? I like trying new restaurants, coffee shops, breweries, bars, you name it, I love to try it! I enjoy traveling, mostly to city centers or countrysides, not so much beaches. I don’t play many video games or watch anime at all, but that doesn’t mean I’m not open to it. I like trivia nights, sporting events, farmers markets, plant stores and antiques.

I guess what I’m looking for is a partner. Someone I can connect with, someone I can have fun with, someone to be lazy with, someone to travel with. Looking for some to make laugh and to make me laugh. I guess someone to do anything and everything with. Not really sold on one relationship type, so I am open for discussion!

Maybe you’re out there in the world, and maybe I’m the one you’re looking for, or maybe I’m not but let’s chat like we’ve been friends for ten years and see where it goes. No pressure, no expectations, just two people connecting.

Every time she is working, this is what she puts in my bag.","I have loved this coffee shop and for a solid 6 years it was the same crew all the time. Type of place where when you order the same thing, they know what you want. Not a necessity of course but an extra nice perk from people who care. People eventually phased out and a few young adults (older teens) were hired to replace them. This particular barista was new at the time, and she had botched a few of my exact same order a couple times. The last time, again TWO years ago, she didn’t put a napkin nor fork in with my one slice of quiche. So I turned around and asked for one of each. The attitude level was obscene. One could call bias as I manage 300+ associates directly related to customer service but because of this, I can handle slight attitudes for situations that may be difficult to handle for those not used to the industry. But over a fork and napkin? It wasn’t that serious to treat a customer like I’d screwed your boyfriend and birthed his child within a span of six minutes. 

I spoke with one of the older baristas I’d known a while about it and she was cool because again, it wasn’t that serious. But now every single time this one is there, she literally puts a day’s worth of napkins in there. Plus like 4 forks. 
It’s so petty, obnoxious and not to mention *wasteful* for a ma/pop place in a sea of increasing chain places surrounding it.

I am also a wheelchair user. TL-DR at the end. I was very lucky to work in a school with a very understanding head teacher, who treated me like any other employee and did everything she could to accommodate my needs without treating me any differently. I specialised in SEND (special education needs and disabilities) and as part of my job, would attend meetings with other professionals linked to certain students. So think social workers, other in school staff like the SENCO (special educational needs coordinator), therapists, youth workers and council staff linked to education etc along with parents/ carers/ foster parents etc.**

**Some of these meetings would be at my school and some off site, my head would always offer up a meeting room at our school, because the school was fully accessible and I didn’t have to worry about driving to and finding accessible parking and then worrying about the building being fully accessible etc. The majority of the time everyone not from my school was more than happy as we were centrally located, had a large, free car park and did good catering with a proper coffee machine and nice fruit platters and pastries instead of the usual, a pack of stale digestive biscuits and cheap instant coffee. So win win all round.**

**One day I had a meeting with a new student (who we will call Fred), who was going to be joining my class. I was liasing between the various people involved in the meeting, which included Fred’s social worker. They were then liasing with the Fred’s foster parents as I didn’t have their contact info. I knew the social worker from other students and she knew that we would have the meeting at my school and why and was more than happy for this (she often joked she wished she could have all her meetings here, even for pupils not at our school, because of the nice coffee and fruit platters) and we arranged it all.**

**Day of the meeting and I’m alerted by reception that my guests were there. I roll off to meet them and before I can approach the foster parents (the other people involved in the meeting hadn’t arrived yet) they were ranting at receptionist on how ridiculous it was that they had to come here and couldn’t have had it at the council office, all because supposedly someone in the meeting had a “disability” (said using air quotes) and it was easier for them to have it here. Ranting about how stupid this was to pander to people like this, how people will make up disabilities to be the centre of attention and how it was getting worse and never like this in the past. (They were in their 60’s) The poor receptionist is trying to get a word in and spots me and looks embarrassed knowing I’ve seen and heard this but I don’t care.**

**I roll over and introduce myself as Fred’s new teacher and before I can say anything else I’m interrupted by the woman as she says “don’t be stupid, you aren’t his new teacher, you can’t possibly be a teacher if you’re a wheelchair” (not wheelchair user, just “wheelchair” something I sadly get a lot when people for example would say “a wheelchair wants to come in”, like I’m an inanimate object and not actually a human, but I digress) and then turns to the poor receptionist and goes “can you let the teacher know we’re here and turns to her husband and goes “phone the social worker, this is ridiculous”. Poor Fred at this point has his head in his hands and looks so anxious and shy and like he wants to disappear. I lift my lanyard and staff badge to the woman and reply “I can assure you that I am Mrs Complex Case, Fred’s new teacher and that my legs not working had no affect on my ability to be a teacher and that they two aren’t mutually affected by each other.”**

**At this point, the social worker, the educational psychologist and another worker (speech and language if my memory serves me right) walk in and the foster mother goes “oh thank god you’re here, none of you look disabled so why you insisted on us having the meeting here for that reason is beyond me.” Turning to her husband and the receptionist saying “I told you, people make up all sorts of “disabilities” nowadays and want everyone to pander to them. It’s getting worse and worse” before returning to the social worker and continuing with “Also Fred’s teacher hasn’t arrived yet but she (rudely thrusting her finger in my face) is trying to say that she is his teacher, when she clearly can’t be as, well look at her!” (Giving me a rude glare and up and down ‘if looks could kill’ assessment)**

**The social worker, shocked, replies “I’ll remind you now that you are both new foster parents and so are subject to frequent reviews to assess your suitability for the job.” Foster mum butts in and goes “what do you mean? We’re here AND agreed to come to the school to accommodate one of you apparently having a disability that I can’t see!” Social worker sighs and goes “well insulting Mrs Complex Case and all disabled people, isn’t really a great first impression. Mrs Complex Case is indeed Fred’s new teacher (who by this point was trying his hardest to merge into the sofa he is sat on so as not exist in the reception area anymore) because wheelchair users can be teachers.”**

**Foster mum tried to butt in at this point but the social worker holds her hand up to silence her, which makes the foster mum get even more red in the face and carries on talking. “Plus, the school is actually closer to your house than the council offices, has free abundant parking, unlike the council offices and best of all has amazing coffee and refreshments. You’re lucky to get a mug of brown coffee flavoured water and an unbroken stale rich tea at the council offices, unlike here where we will get proper coffee and (turning to me) I assume we have one of the amazing fruit platters and a tray of pastries for the meeting?! So having the meeting here benefits all of us, not just being more accessible for Mrs Complex Case!”**

**Before the foster mother can utter a reply, the social worker ushers us all to the meeting room (the poor receptionist had signed them all in during this, later saying she felt so much second hand embarrassment and anxiety, she needed something to do and kept apologising for not doing more- which I kept reassuring her she did nothing wrong and you get a thick skin when disabled) to start the meeting.**

**The meeting went well, we tried to not let the mum say much, the educational psychologist said something like “this meeting is more for us to discuss with Fred directly our plan to help him transition with these new changes and ensure he is happy and safe” and so everything was directed at Fred and seldom at his foster parents.**

**I got very curt “sorry” from the mum at the end of the meeting, followed by a “but you can see how I was confused, it is very odd to see someone like you actually working and especially in a job like this that requires a degree!” I laugh and go “wow next you’ll be telling me I can’t drive or vote or get married or you know, live a normal everyday life!” The father said a more apologetic “sorry” but I got the feeling that she very much is in control of that relationship and his life wouldn’t be worth living if he’d said anything else. The other professionals in the meeting looked more concerned for the couple being foster parents and exchanged glances at the end with me like “I can’t believe I’ve witnessed all of this” In the meeting at the start, the psychologist said that he had worked with me a number of times and how lucky Fred was for having me as a teacher as I was very good at my job and would soon have him settled and caught up and loving school, which I think had angered her more too.**

**Fred looked very sorry and also embarrassed at these new foster parents treating me like they were. Luckily for him, a week later he was removed from them and placed with a lovely couple who had fostered another student of mine in the past. He flourished with them and myself at the school and was a delightful student to have. He had been dealt some awful cards in life and despite all of that, was a lovely child. I often wonder what he is up to now and hoped his biological parents hadn’t won custardy back. Which I know sounds weird wishing such a thing, but they caused him so much physiological and emotional trauma that took a long time to overcome.**

**TL-DR: new foster parents came for a meeting with myself and other professionals and berated my behind my back and to my face for being disabled and couldn’t get over the fact that I could be a wheelchair user AND a teacher.**",6,1736175433.0,AmITheJerk,3,1.0,False

After a year of seeing doctor after doctor I have recently been diagnosed with a secondary disease called secondary porphyria linked to toxin exposure. I did not show any heavy metals, but I did test for mycotoxins. Here’s what my tests revealed:

* **Trichothecene**: Extremely high levels
* **Gliotoxin derivative**: Moderate level
* **Zearalenone**: Moderate level

Over the past year, my health has been deteriorating so I have made sure to eliminate anything bad, and keep a very strict diet including:

* No candles, plastics, or aluminum in my home.
* Switched all beauty/ bathing/ skincare products to natural and fluoride-free toothpaste.
* Installed reverse osmosis for water. (can mold be in water?)
* Mainly eat fresh, organic fruit and vegetables (no gluten, nuts). 1 x week meat/ seafood.
* Switched coffee to organic Whole Foods brand.

Despite all this, I continue to struggle. I live in a new building, so when I suspected mold, I hired a company to investigate. Unfortunately, they didn’t take me seriously. They claimed mold is unlikely in new construction, and I feel like they might’ve just taken my money and not done what I asked. They only did air sampling and one swab but I'm confused how my 800 sq ft apartment wouldn't have the same air results in two rooms, and the swab in the air vent was supposed to be toxic particles not grain and skin.

I felt fine before moving in. Within 60 days of living here, I started getting sick, to the point where I couldn't get through a full day or leave the house for over 2 months. Recently with the weather a little chillier (I'm in Florida) I have opened the windows and my symptoms lessen. Something in this building is 100% triggering me.

The building management won’t help or even consider that there’s an issue, and I’m stuck in a lease. I don’t even know where to begin. I’m desperate to figure it out and I need to correct the problem:

1. What’s causing these elevated mycotoxin levels.
2. How I can eliminate it (or mitigate exposure while stuck in the lease).
3. How to support my health and start recovering.

Has anyone been through this? Any advice or recommendations—whether for testing, identifying hidden sources, or treatment—would mean the world to me. I’m completely overwhelmed and unsure where to turn next.  

Thank you in advance for any guidance you can offer.

THAT FUCKING SUBJECT IS USELESS AS SHIT BY THE WAY LET ME RANT ABOUT WHY THIS STUPID SCHOOL AND SUBJECT IS NOT FUCKING WORTH IT?? So the very start of this is like my home, my home place that gets mad at me for everything and wants me to fit in this incredibly strict and fixed routine like they want me to be perfect but i could give less shits, my classmates are not perfect either so why am i doing this. anyway, im forced to wake up two hours earlier before school cos i need to cook and take a bath then get ready without waking anybody up 💀 mind u at 5AM. we all sleep in the same fucking bed and theres this bozo (my cousin) sleeping outside where im supposed to change cos idfk changing in the bathroom the floor is WET. MY CLOTHES WILL GET WET FUCK. ANYWAY. so its already uncomfortable getting ready for school, AND U WAKE UP AT 5 AM FOR THIS I MIND U, buy a coffee for lost fucking sleep cause i cant even have time to have a life anymore living like that, then go to school, reach around like 7:07 but the actual class starts 7:30. MOST OF THE FUCKING TIME BTW IM NEW AT THIS SCHOOL. THE TEACHER ISNT FUCKING THERE. THEY ARRIVE SOOOO FUCKING LATE AND I CANT EXPLAIN THIS SHIT BELIEVABLY TO MY GUARDIANS LIKE HOOOO THEYRE NOT TAKING THIS SHIT SERIOUSLY WHY SHOULD IIII AAAAAAA.. anyway.. the teachers mostly not there and its just not worth it getting ready getting yelled at sacrificing sleep and happiness just to be met with fucking nothing cos my school sucks and they think my school doesnt suck? no it does so badly. SOO BADLY. ITS SO BAD ITS NOT EVEN BELIEVABLE HOW HORRIBLE THE SCHEDULE IS. anyway so yea i have that set in my mind now teachers mostly not there in pe cos this shit happened 2 times in a row and the other teachers do that shit too. we get this fucking project for religion, its like u have to make a presentation for the topic given to u and mind u religion is not fucking easy to learn. so well whatever, my strand is GAS and im kinda sorry for saying this but its filled with idiots. i just chose GAS because i hate science and math (and didnt even know this but our science teacher is absolute shit and influences the grading through personal feelings 😐) and i dont wanna do boring ass ABM. thats all we have, GAS - STEM - ABM. so i chose GAS, i was adopted by these two girls on my first day lets call them Runa and Xin. on the day we were given topics to make a presentation on (and this is honestly all we did first semester [FOR ALL SUBJECTS.], still on break til now..) Xin was absent and well we were all new to each other so me and Runa were automatically partners with each other. the thing is, i think Runa's pretty dumb 😭 but i cant tell her that so i just accepted it. bad choice, i overworked myself to save our project from my a little bit less smart partner. teacher gave us a deadline to do it for one week and i was lowkey panicking cause i dont think they understand we have subjects everyday of the week too and dont have time for that shit. maam ur making me learn about shintoism i have never even heard of this religion before and make me teach it to my classmates that cant understand it unless i explain it to them like theyre 5. okay, so i did all nighters trying to figure out how to do this, its my first time being met with ""make a presentation on this for school even tho u know nothing about it"" type shit and i skipped school everyday for the entirety of covid and im tryna remember how this works again. talked w my partner Runa and she dont know either were both new students along with Xin, most of us in GAS are new tbf.. and we shared our research but like u can see what Runa types is just a copy paste from google and u cant even understand what it says from its robot ahh tone as if its some bitch like sigmund freud typing smth. thats not going in the presentation buddy can u be  bit more helpful? obv dont have the heart to tell her that so i just divided the project in two, i take beliefs and practices, creation story and introduction - and she takes history, influences and conclusion. cos.. i take the main parts and dont trust Runa to give out misinformation or sigmund freud type writing. i do all nighters tryna work this shit with my spare time and yk obviously it doesnt fucking finish in time, but in one week i have a base idea on what shintoism is but cant explain it in a presentation. we tell our teacher the week after given topics most of us havent finished and one did, they had christianity and it was short and boring plain as hell design but they had this really religious guy on their team so it was okay i guess. now i was really gonna lock in to make my presentation, i barely finished the beliefs part btw, cos at first i think it was labeled as beliefs and philosophy or sum shit? i couldnt find what the beliefs of shintoism really was, cos we studied buddhism and hinduism before this and they had clear beliefs and philosphy so i was confused af. but apparently no, shinto isnt really too focused on that with a strict set of like moral codes and a historical stories, they have a really nice fictional story tho i give u that the creation story was finished in no time very interesting. but the beliefs were hard to see so that took almost 4 days to put in the presentation, my partner atp hasnt really done anything i was hoping for her to do so on her own but nope :) >:( just a google copy and paste for the history of shintoism that doesnt rlly explain anything but okay pop off sis. then yk idw explain my whole sitting in a chair for hours journey so ""i did my research"" then was blessed with no classes like yay.. there was a typhoon for one week so suspended for a week, could focus on project.. then they didnt tell me they had an organizational week so yea i skipped that it lasted 2 weeks, yk when u dont have school for a while u start to be lazy, i was lazier to physically move but not lazy to do my research. classes resumed and yk pe class again, didnt wanna go cos i spent so much sleepless nights researching had a horrible headache with no sleep so fuck no im not gonna prepare at 5 am to go to school where my teacher probs isnt there, skipped other classes too but i was gaining back on sleep a bit just fucked up my body clock and even if i wasnt at school i was studying so ig its the same, didnt know tho that when i skipped pe classes that time we had prelims. then the next one i skipped cos of bad health were midterms. so. my teacher texted my guardian, and kicked me out cos i failed midterms and prelims, its like their tradition?? they asked me before tho if i felt like i was failing anywhere nd i said pe, they said ask to do smth abt it but i just shoved it off cos i didnt know they meant the teachers actually could give other stuff and not an exam redo cos my teachers always emphasize theyre not giving another exam if we miss it so i was like fuck it, its PE anyway that shit class sucks . they didnt tell me if i failed i was actually gonna get kicked out 😐 like wow okay. but anyway, i made Runa do her part already before i was kicked out so we were set to do our reporting, i finished it all just so inconvenient that i was kicked out and my next place to live in is an hour away from my school i only enrolled in because it was close to my .. past guardians home 😑 my dad found me a bedspace to stay at and we were ready to report, reporting went amazing teacher said it was very well made like thanks i lost my house for this. but anyway, i failed pe too, dont wanna fail actually and my teacher never responds to texts and always says ""I'll see"" to my requests at school. just honestly how do i explain it to her, my reasons for missing PE prelims and midterms and why she should fucking give me extra activities to help with my grades, and how to actually get her to respond.. the bitch always leaves me on seen, even irl, its flabbergasting. i just dont wanna fail and wanna long story short this, also i have social anxiety i think irl so.. idrk how to talk to these shitty teachers :/ i hate them, i hate this school, my past guardians think i skip school even tho our sched is just shit and i skip cos i feel too terrible to get up, and mostly it was just so rainy those days obviously classes are suspended. they call me a liar bc i always say theres no school like come lets go back in time elderly dumbass and bask in the meaningless stupidity with me in my school maybe youll understand im not lying, and if u had two working eyeballs youll see what im doing on the computer is not gaming. they are retards, trying to project their own failed school life to me ""i had straight 75's but never reached a failing grade"" i can see that.. they always think im gaming, going out with friends or skipping class to go to malls atp i just think theyre blind because i dont even have flashy clothes why would it make sense for me to love skipping class to go out??

My partner and I just booked a 2-week trip based in Florence in May — we considered staying in a few different areas but this is our first time traveling internationally together, so we decided to keep it less stressful and just stay in one hotel in one city and do day-trips out here and there.

My question for you: what are your MUST DO items in/around Florence? We are staying in Santo Spirito, close enough to walk or bike to the city center. Of course we plan to explore the historic section, museums, basilica, all the hard hitters. We also want to take a few days trips (definitely Pisa, maybe also bologna? Cinque Terre? Etc…!). 

If you know the area and had ~11 full days, what would you do? Where would you go? For context - we both are foodies (have worked in kitchens, coffee roasteries, behind bars, etc.) We LOVE good food and drink, and we also are both artists and love history, and do a lot of hiking and physical activities together! Of course we want to keep the stress levels down (vacation, after all…) but also want to make the most of the trip :)

My breasts are the worst affected area with blood filled spots. Rarely do I even get puss and guaranteed to have blood. I do have minor spots on my groin that range between blood filled to deeper bumps and a very rare bump or two on the armpits.

I could use any advice on what has helped put you in remission or nearly there. I welcome your experience with biologics on a deeper level than just “it worked for me”.

I always make sure to clear the grinder using the bellows both before and after grinding.

There has been a change in weather recently here in Miami and temps have dropped along with humidity. I have noticed a lot of grinds clinging to the exit area.

Context: 

Hello everyone! I just want to ask for your opinion about this, there's this friend of mine that my girlfriend is not good with him because I've been with this guy nung OJT pa kami and we're close friends with my girlfriend but hindi niya nagustuhan itong friend ko as days go by kasi parang na aabuso daw ako for being nice. So ayaw na ng girlfriend ko na mag hangout kami nun, so for the past months my friend keep insisting that we go out for a coffee and talk talk lang ganun, but I consistently deny because ayaw nga ng girlfriend ko.

 Then there's this one time where he asked me mag kape ulit and I don't want to be rude or mean to deny it so I confirmed na okay sige just to settle the deal and have my peace of mind already, like just get it over with ganun. 

But then my mistake here is I agreed without telling my girlfriend. When I told her that inaaya ako ng friend ko ng kape, she told me na ayaw niya. I said alright, but I was caught in a predicament na I agreed na sa friend ko( I know that na sana I told my friend nalang na I can't and called it off ganun hays Idk what's up with myself).

So my friend picked me up sa office along the way and head out to have a coffeee, I am so guilty of this and so afraid to let my girl know about it kasi alam ko na magagalit siy. Well my girlfriend had a gut feeling na I went out with my friend, so she asked me if I was with my friend, I said no and making alibis(I'M SO STUPID ON THIS I KNOW). Then she called and I dropped the call and confessed that I am with my friend.

That's where the silent treatment started, I am fully aware of my mistake on this one. I am also reflecting on it and sana tumanggi nalang talaga ako, it shouldn't be that hard siguro, Idk lang what got into me and just accepted the offer, I just want it to be over it. I never lied to my girlfriend before, I love this girl so much and I couldn't believe also that I lied and betrayed her because of my fear na magagalit siya.

I just want your thoughts on this guys, what's the best approach on this one. I don't want to lose her like this, trust is very important for me and for the relationship, how ironic it is for me to break that.

What do you do if your partner makes less money than you? ,"I am a 27F and several of my friends and myself are dating men who are 30+ somehow everyone except for my bf charges their partner (whether they live together or not) half of everything. Im talking one guy charges his gf gas money for rides, 5$ for a coffee etc. it’s crazy to me bc i wouldnt even charge my co worker, friend, or family for that?? Certainly not my bf bc i believe it kind of evens out and I trust him to cover another expense that inevitably will come up. Also, i make a lot less money than him and we believe in equity is not equal 50/50? Not sure if thats wrong either? My bf makes probably easily double what I make and I pay what I can and he pays the rest but he will as my capacity and find a budget that works for us esp when its gifting season for weddings/bdays/holidays etc. bc we do split those evenly or keep similar enough budget for each other. He gladly pays for my stuff (which he does NOT owe me and I dont sit around asking him to bankroll my life) or is open about needing to reel in his spending bc he has a bachelor trip or whatever and I’ll say the same if I have a tuition payment coming up or whatever. 

Another one of my friends (27F) said her bf (31M) pays for half only even though he makes significantly more money and they live together. They dont share food or anything they cook separately and he leaves her to struggle to pay half (and his mom told him to get a prenup even though her fam has $ they just dont bankroll her). Super weird! I wonder if this is bc they dont like her or they dont like that someone who is qualified like her does not make enough $ or are accusing her of asking him to pay her bills when shes under-employed for her capacity? This one freaks me out a lot for her but also wtf. 

Lastly, one of my friends (27F) makes more than her bf and she pays more expenses but he does all errands/ more around the house to contribute, which makes sense?? My friend makes more money than his wife and his salary pays for their living expenses and her salary / job pays for insurance, pet care, groceries, medical bills etc. which also makes sense?? I worry for my friend who gets charged for a 5$ bagel. She is in denial and thinks its normal bc she isnt making $ bc shes in school right now and he works (a high paying corporate finance job). I asked what the justification is now and she said “bc i have more earning potential than him when I graduate then I can bankroll his life” (then shouldnt he bank roll HER now? And why is he entitled to her $ in the future?)I tried to talk to her about how this isnt equitable or fair and kind of a red flag and she cut me off and is defensive. My therapist said its a big red flag bc its a control thing?

Is it a competition of ""whoever from my roster impresses me more I'll take more seriously?"" Do they even have the time or headspace to develop feelings, process or think things through? Or do they senselessly jump from one thing to another completely numb and desensitised just ""for the plot""?

Ofc I can't say anything, it's their life, their right, their mentality. But do you see how for people who are genuine and want to connect with someone it's an ABSOLUTE CATASTROPHE? Like we'll go out, I'll like him more and more each time, will start falling for him to only know Im just a number on his list and he's only seeing me because some other number dropped him or it didnt work out ... ?

I have a date coming up with a 24yo guy I matched on Tinder... what should I do? How to best approach this? Should I go there entirely no expectations, casual, friendly etc? Not take him seriously at all? He compliments me and is super excited to see me (I left our hometown for uni within the first week we met but we kept in touch and now we're meeting during my winter break). Should I show my interest? Should I just view it as a one-time meeting and then nothing? What if he expects s3x or ONS and takes it as a given that that's what we're here to do ... ? Even if the concept of rosters is real, who would admit it upon asking? It's like an unspoken/unwritten ""rule"" kinda ... Should I bail out and not meet him at all if it's gonna be like this as to not get hurt?",0,1736174119.0,AskMenAdvice,22,0.4,False

My life revolves around literature, theology, and philosophy because apparently, I thought, Why not overthink everything while also sounding pretentious? Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.

I’ve been scribbling letters since I was six , mostly to my grandmother, bless her patience, and occasionally attempting to send her postcards… without stamps, naturally. (Turns out, the postal service doesn’t appreciate my creativity.) Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of forging some amazing connections, most of which I’ve had to let go. Not for dramatic reasons, mind you - just your garden-variety “it’s not you, it’s me” scenarios.

Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of picking up the pen again, but procrastination is my middle name. Today, however, I finally decided to make good on that thought.I’m absolutely thrilled to meet you, well, not “meet” in the literal sense because, you know, letters...but close enough! And if you feel inspired to write back, I’ll be so grateful I might even send you a postcard. Don’t worry, this time I’ll remember the stamp. Probably.

When I’m not passionately arguing with myself about the meaning of life (or why tea will forever outclass coffee), you’ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting like a mad scientist who traded test tubes for spatulas. Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.

Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.

I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

In a nutshell, I’m equal parts thinker and clown, with a dash of culinary chaos. My DMs are open, so slide in like a confident penguin on ice.

Today is my dad’s birthday and he left out this morning saying “I have to go rush your grandmother to the hospital.”  He’s done this before because she’s been having issues with breathing and her heart. So I had the regular concern I always do but nothing completely anxiety-inducing. 

I’m getting my twins’ breakfast ready and then my mom comes downstairs sobbing. My heart immediately dropped and my stomach tightened. She told me my grandma died. 

I feel like a fucking robot right now. I just blinked and told her to go back upstairs so my daughter and son wouldn’t see her crying. I finished making them breakfast and I kind of just started blankly staring in the kitchen. 

I just made myself some coffee, went in my room, broke down crying briefly and took my anti-anxiety meds. 

I have no other information on what’s going on. I have 4 siblings and I’m not sure if they know yet. I’m scared that I can’t really cry?

I spent so much time with her as a kid, more than with my own parents because they worked so much. I feel awful for my dad right now. His mother just died on his birthday.

I just don’t know how to “be” right now. Also have no clue how I’m going to explain this to my daughter. My son has nonverbal autism so there’s no way for me to explain it to him. My daughter *just* talked with her on the phone two days ago. And she loves calling her/facetiming her.

My dad just texted me as I’m writing this that “her heart just stopped”. I hope she wasn’t in pain.

I am new to RV life and thought I got a great deal and on my 2018 MAD Mercedes Class B Sprinter van for LazyDayz, but have been having problems since the purchase in May 2024. The biggest most frustrating problem is that it won’t hold a charge. I had my van on shore power for a week at a campground, do some driving and park for the evening without shore power. The only things that were actively drawing power overnight was the fridge (set only to about 2coldness) and my phone charger (microwave remains unplugged unless in use as well as any other possible parasitic power sucks I can unplug inside the van) when I woke up the next morning and tried to use my coffee maker it kept shutting off and I got the E01 error on my converter before switching back to 11.7v. Before I went to bed it was above 12.4.

I want to be able to boondock and not have to rely on shore power. Google searches aren’t super helpful as there is nothing specific for a class b rv MAD and everything mechanically is so well tucked away and hidden it’s hard to troubleshoot like they show on bigger rvs. Is there anyone out there that can give me some insight. Mind you this is definitely my midlife crisis era and my first rv of any kind so please use layman’s terms. Thanks in advance",1,1736173749.0,RVing,0,1.0,False

So I stood up and went close to the counter for privacy and so I feel comfortable. It did help. I also asked him about what he does etc. Then whatever I didn’t feel like sharing, I told him, “you don’t need to know this”.

1hv07gm,https://i.redd.it/sjx0a1ygvdbe1.png,Whisper of spring ,"Lily stepped into the airport, immediately engulfed by the bustling crowd. The cacophony of voices, the rush of travelers, and the overwhelming sea of people made her feel claustrophobic. Her breathing quickened, and she clutched tightly to the items in her hands: her diary, phone, suitcase, bag, boarding pass, flight ticket, and her book.

The weight of everything she was carrying, both physically and emotionally, became too much. Her hands trembled, and in her nervousness, she dropped everything. Papers scattered, her book slid across the floor, and her suitcase tipped over.

Panic surged through her, and she knelt down, scrambling to gather her belongings. Tears of frustration pricked her eyes as she tried to compose herself, but the noise and the crowd only made it worse.

Just then, a warm, calm voice broke through the chaos. ""Hey, do you need help? Let me help you.""

Lily looked up to see a tall, handsome man with light green eyes and brown curly hair kneeling down beside her, already picking up her scattered items. He handed her the diary, phone, boarding pass and flight ticket, then picked up her book, glancing at the title before giving it back to her. ""Good choice,"" he said, his smile widening. ""I like this book.""

Lily felt a small smile tug at her lips. ""Me too.

Once all her things were gathered, he stood up, offering her a hand to help her to her feet.

""Do you need help with anything else?"" he asked.

Lily, still feeling a bit overwhelmed but grateful, shook her head. ""No, I think, I'm okay now. Thank you so much.

""No problem,"" he replied, giving her one last reassuring smile. 'Safe travels'

With that, he turned and began to make his way through the crowd. Lily stood there, watching him walk away with her big, expressive eyes, feeling a strange sense of loss as he disappeared into the throng of people.

For the first time in a long while, she had felt safe around someone. It was a comforting realization, one that brought a small, hopeful smile to her face. She whispered to herself, ""That was the first time I felt safe around someone.""

With renewed determination, Lily took a deep breath and continued towards her gate, feeling a little less alone and a little more ready to face the journey ahead.

Lily shook off the lingering sense of longing and refocused on her journey. She made her way to the check-in counter, where she managed to complete all her boarding pass work without further incident. Now she is feeling bit calm.

With her boarding pass in hand, she looked around for a place to eat. Her stomach grumbled, reminding her that she hadn't eaten anything since that morning. Spotting a small café, she made her way over and joined the line.

The café smelled of fresh coffee and pastries, a comforting aroma that eased her nerves further. When it was her turn, she ordered a sandwich and a cup of tea, deciding on something simple and warm. She found a quiet corner and sat down, taking a moment to savor the food and the brief respite from the chaos around her.

As she ate, her mind wandered back to the brief encounter with that Man. His kindness had left a lasting impression, making her feel a little less overwhelmed by the daunting journey ahead. She took a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the tea and the comfort of the food settle her even more.

Once she finished, she gathered her things and made her way to the gate, feeling a bit more prepared for the next leg of her journey.

Oliver pov

Oliver weaved through the busy airport, his mind still on the visit to his aunt and uncle’s place. He’d spent a few days in New York, catching up, but now it was time to head back to Washington D.C. He was already running late, so his eyes were scanning the signs, looking for his gate number. The terminal was crowded, people rushing in every direction, and the constant hum of voices made everything feel a bit suffocating.

But then, something caught his eye.

There, amidst the crowd, stood a woman. She was a few feet away, surrounded by travelers, yet in that moment, it felt like everything else faded away. The noise, the movement—everything seemed to blur around her. She stood there so still, almost like she didn’t belong to the rush of the airport.

She wore a white maxi dress, and as she turned slightly, her long black hair caught the light. It flowed in the breeze created by the people passing by, and for a moment, she looked almost unreal, like a figure from a painting.

Oliver paused, his steps slowing as he watched her. He couldn’t see her face clearly, but there was something about her—something that pulled at him. The way she stood there, lost in the crowd, it felt like she was waiting for something, or maybe, just trying to hold herself together in the chaos.

And then it happened.

Someone brushed by her, and without warning, she dropped everything. Her phone, her papers, her boarding pass—everything scattered around her feet. Her book slid across the floor, and her suitcase tipped over, making a small thud as it hit the ground.

Could I go ? 

his feet were already in motion. Something about the way she looked—like she was struggling to hold it together—made him feel like he couldn’t just walk away. He threaded his way through the crowd, each step taking him closer to her, ignoring the people around him.

When he finally reached her. he knelt down beside her, already picking up all her stuff.

She looked up, startled at first, and he saw the confusion and panic in her eyes. Her lips parted to say something, but no words came out.

He picked up her book, glancing at the title. ""Good choice,"" he said with a small smile, trying to ease the tension in the air.

She blinked, her face softening for a moment. It wasn’t much, but he could tell it meant something to her.

Once all her things were gathered, he stood up and offered her his hand. “Do you need help with anything else?”

She shook her head, now she is  looking a little calm and grateful. “No, I think I’m okay now. Thank you so much.”

Oliver nodded, his heart lifting just a little. ""Anytime,"" he said with a warm smile. ""Safe travels.""

As he turned to walk away, he couldn't help but glance back one last time. There was something in the way she held herself, like she was trying so hard to stay composed. He had to wonder what was going on in her head, but before he could think too much about it, the crowd swallowed him up again.

Still, something about her lingered in his thoughts, as if their brief encounter was just the beginning of something more.

1hv05xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hv05xk/she_humiliated_me_for_my_sexuality_but_we_ended/,"She humiliated me for my sexuality, but we ended up together","

I don’t know why I fell for her. Maybe it was the way she carried herself, so confident and untouchable, or maybe it was her smile—bright, perfect, and impossible to look away from. Her name was Rachel, and she was everything I wasn’t: popular, loud, and fearless.

I didn’t mean to fall for her. I really didn’t. But when you’re a teenage girl trying to figure yourself out, sometimes your heart doesn’t ask for permission.


---

It happened one afternoon after school. I stayed behind to finish a project, and Rachel was there with her friends, laughing and joking around. I barely managed to keep my focus; her voice had this way of pulling me in.

Later, when everyone left, I saw my chance. My hands were shaking, my heart racing. I found her at her locker.

“Hey, Rachel,” I said, trying to sound casual but failing miserably.

She turned, raising an eyebrow. “Uh, yeah? What’s up?”

I swallowed hard. “I just… I wanted to tell you something.”

She crossed her arms, waiting.

“I—I like you,” I blurted out. “I mean, like, like like you.”

For a second, she just stared at me. Then she laughed. Not the kind of laugh you want to hear. It was sharp and cruel.

“Wait, are you serious?” she said, her voice dripping with disgust.

I nodded, feeling my face burn.

“Oh my God,” she said, stepping back like I was contagious. “That’s disgusting. You’re disgusting.”

Her words hit me like a punch to the stomach.

“I—” I started, but she cut me off.

“Don’t even try to talk to me again,” she said, loud enough for the stragglers in the hallway to hear. “What kind of freak are you?”


---

By the next day, everyone knew. Rachel and her friends made sure of that.

“Hey, Lily,” one of the boys sneered as I walked by. “Looking for a girlfriend?”

Someone else added, “Careful, don’t let her near you. She might catch feelings.”

The laughter followed me everywhere. I wanted to disappear.

I couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror. Being a lesbian felt like a curse, like something dirty and wrong. I started skipping school, staying in my room for days. My parents didn’t understand; how could they?


---

Months passed. The bullying faded a bit, but the shame didn’t. Every time I saw Rachel in the hall, I felt a mix of anger and hurt. She never even looked at me. It was like I didn’t exist anymore, which, honestly, was better than being her target.

And then, out of nowhere, she started talking to me again.


---

It was after gym class. I was tying my shoes when she walked over.

“Hey, Lily,” she said, her voice soft, almost shy.

I looked up, confused. “What do you want?”

She hesitated, then said, “I just… I’ve been thinking about you. About what happened.”

My chest tightened. “Why? So you can humiliate me again?”

“No!” she said quickly. “I was a jerk, okay? I was scared, and I took it out on you.”

I didn’t know what to say, so I didn’t say anything.

She kept talking. “I didn’t realize how much I hurt you. I’m sorry.”

I wanted to believe her, but something felt off. She kept staring at me, her eyes too intense, too desperate.


---

At first, I thought it was guilt. She started finding excuses to talk to me, asking about my day, sitting near me in class. It felt… weird.

And then it got weirder.

She started showing up everywhere I went. At lunch, in the library, even outside my house once.

“Rachel, what are you doing here?” I asked, stepping onto the porch.

She shrugged, holding a coffee. “I thought you might like this. It’s your favorite, right?”

“How do you know my favorite coffee?”

She smiled nervously. “I pay attention.”

That’s when it clicked. She wasn’t just apologizing. She was obsessed.


---

It escalated fast. She’d text me constantly, even though I never gave her my number. She’d leave notes in my locker, little gifts on my desk.

“Rachel, you need to stop,” I told her one day after school.

She shook her head. “I can’t. I can’t stop thinking about you, Lily. I—I like you.”

My stomach churned. “You like me? After everything you did?”

“I was stupid,” she said, grabbing my hands. “I didn’t know what I felt back then. But I know now.”

I pulled away. “You humiliated me. You made my life hell. And now you think you can just… what? Make it all better?”

“I’ll do anything,” she said, tears streaming down her face.

I didn’t know what to say. Part of me wanted to scream at her, to tell her to leave me alone. But another part of me—God help me—still cared.


---

Over the next few weeks, she kept wearing me down. She was everywhere, always trying to prove herself. Slowly, I started to believe her.

One night, she showed up at my door again, soaked from the rain.

“I can’t stop thinking about you,” she said, her voice trembling. “I know I messed up, but I love you, Lily. Please give me a chance.”

I stared at her, my heart pounding. “You love me?”

“Yes,” she said. “I’ve never been so sure of anything in my life.”

Against my better judgment, I let her in. And somehow, against all odds, we ended up together.


---

It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t healthy. But it was us. And for now, that was enough.

On Sniffies I always make it clear that I’m looking for “right now” and am hosting. I’m used to getting messages from people who are just looking for validation and don’t actually intend to hookup, or worse- say they want to hookup but flake after they receive my address.   
  
The ones who are just looking for validation usually come at me hot and heavy with tons of their X rated pics, lots of sexually charged language about what they want me to do to them/do to me, but give the excuse that they’re “not available until next week” or something similar when the conversation comes to when to meet and where (I can always host), followed by them providing their availability but they are always ""busy"" or ""running errands"" when you message them when they're online during one of the times \*they\* provided/instructed you to contact them (sure Jan, you post daily about ""sucking now"" or that you're looking for someone to ""use your holes"") or my message being left on read. So I write them off as no longer being interested, block and move on. The ones who are likely to flake always go from hot and horny to suddenly cold one-word responses of “okay” after I’ve given them my address and confirm the time they’ll be over. When they’ve failed to show up within 60 minutes of the expected time they said they would arrive or they are online and leaving me on read when I check in, I then block. At this point I can tell with almost certainty who will be a waste of my time.  
  
What I am not used to is encountering this behavior on my Grindr profile which is aimed at just meeting people for coffee or a drink and getting to know them. I often receive taps from people, to which I’ll respond and introduce myself:  
  
Me: “Thanks for the tap, my name is Love\_Sausage. How’s your day going?”  
  
Them: \*message read, no response”  
  
3 days pass…. They tap again  
  
Me: “Saw you tapped me again. What’s up?”  
  
Them: \*message read, no response”  
  
More time passes…. They tap again  
  
Me: \*blocks\*  
  
These kinds of interactions annoy me. They’re not bots since I live in a medium size town and have seen many of these people either randomly in person or on other apps. The other form of this is when they message me with a “hi” or “hello”, I respond, they read my response greeting and don’t message back, only to repeat the behavior days later.  
  
The behavior that truly leaves me baffled and actually bothered is when guys message me on grindr or bumble, we have a really good conversation about our careers, interests, pets and hobbies, what we’re looking for in the long-term, joke around and make each other laugh, etc. I am often told they are not into/not looking for a hookup. These conversations typically end with them asking \*me\* out for a drink or to dinner and I agree and give my availability which is fairly flexible. This is where the I get the same non-committal “I’m not available until next week” excuse from them, which never materializes if you check in the following week. The message always goes to read status without a response. Or worse, I agree to a time and date to meet somewhere….. and they suddenly go cold with one worded “okay” responses when I check in the day of, or they don’t show when I get to the bar or restaurant.  
  
I fully understand and accept this behavior is the norm when I’m on a sex app like Sniffies since most guys on there are just using your chat & pics as jerkoff fantasy material, or their nerves get to them for whatever reason causing them to flake, but I’m absolutely stunned encountering this same behavior on my non-hookup profile on Grindr & bumble BFF at almost the same frequency. Is this just the norm now when you approach non-sexualized online interactions with other guys?  
  
Are guys now setting up a coffee & chat dates they don’t intend to show up for to receive validation & bumps of dopamine? Was it always like this or is this just the norm now after covid lockdowns effed up everyone's social skills? It’s even more frustrating since \*i am the one being approached and THEY are asking to meet me\*, so I don’t feel I’m misreading social cues of someone who is not interested in me or just too uncomfortable or cowardly to say “no thank you”. When I was single 8 years ago, I don't recall it being so difficult to set up simple platonic meet & greets with other men- it was easy to set up and I frequently went on them. Now that I'm back on apps it feels nearly impossible to develop any meaningful platonic interactions versus me finding a random to blow some loads with. 

It doesn't matter what age group the guys are in, late 20's to 50's the behavior is the same. Nearly every interaction I have with guys who \*say\* they are looking for friends and meaningful connection when they approach me, never materializes beyond that first chat regardless of the quality of the conversation. I'm fine with dealing with rejection and flakes when it comes to sex- it doesn't affect my confidence or view of my self-worth. I view it as we simply weren't compatible and it was better to not meet than to have a bad hookup.  However, constantly getting lead on by people who say they're looking for friends, or even stood up for something simple like a drink to just have a chat leaves me feeling kind of shitty, and left feeling like I am not interpreting these interactions correctly, especially when I get left on read rather than a simple ""I've changed my mind about meeting"" or something simple like that.

In the past 3 months I've had a grand total of one of these offers from other guys for a drink/coffee turn into an actual meet up. Am I the problem or is this just common now?",5,1736173378.0,AskGaybrosOver30,16,0.78,False

I went into a connivence store at the gas station this morning to buy my coffee for the drive to work. I noticed at the checkout window that there is a sign that says quote “Passports not accepted” which I am going assume is for the purchasing on alcohol or tobacco. To me, this sounds vaguely discriminatory in given the area and the local population’s tendency to have some rather xenophobic opinions or at a minimum it is not a policy that is implemented in good faith. 

I know that store owners can refuse to serve customers on any grounds except for protected ones, does this constitute a protected case? I know protected cases in Tennessee are explicitly age, gender, and race. 

Are there other laws Tennessee for the use of passport to buy alcohol or tobacco?

If I go and try to buy alcohol with a passport and subsequently be refused, would I have grounds to sue( assuming I have a shitload of money and like a side hobby of limiting xenophobic to borderline racist policies)

I did pull the GIS data for the property owner and it is an Exxon brand gas station for alternative resolution to this situation( as I would like to think that Exxon would have some sort of brand policy control for this scenario).

We have a commercial espresso machine, and I've been trying to work on my coffees since I started working here. I haven't had any real barista training, just shown how to use the machine by my co-workers who also haven't been trained.

I'm trying to make a basic latte Rosetta but I can't for the life of me get the white to show on top of the coffee when I pour the milk except for the last few drops in the pitcher. It always sinks straight under. I've tried pouring faster and slower, closer to the cup and further away. I'm pretty sure the problem is something to do with how I'm steaming the milk, but I really can't tell what I'm doing wrong. I've watched quite a few milk steaming and latte art tutorials on youtube and tried everyone's different techniques and as far as I can tell I'm following them to the letter, but nothing's working. The milk just sinks under every time.

Despite my best efforts and hundreds of coffee's later, I've not made any progress since starting work here. It feels like I'm banging my head against the wall. [Here are some of today's attempts](https://imgur.com/a/Fp6FWaa), can you tell what I'm doing wrong? I add air to the milk until I get about a 30% increase in volume and then submerge the wand to try to whisk the foam into the milk. I can get a glossy texture in the milk by swirling it after steaming (like white emulsion paint), but I'm having trouble getting it to look and feel ""silky"" as it's supposed to.

I take 10mg XR and it works really well for me. I find that it regulates my sleep schedule amongst many other things. It aids my dyscalculia, like when I was diagnosed in college, I was finally able to make it through more rigorous math courses (still with some difficulty, but I did it and became so much more confident.)

I'm 26 years old and completely in love with my former manager from when I worked at Nike. Now, four years after I quit, I'm working at the store right in front of his, and I'm going crazy. He's a very intelligent and interesting man, a former basketball player with beautiful hands and an incredible voice, and he was always very kind to me. We had great conversations. Recently, I found out that he's single, and I managed to casually run into him in the corridors, where he gave me hugs that made my knees weak. I then messaged him on Instagram about his coffee invitation, we chatted briefly, and that was it. Being dramatic, I feel like I'm yearning for him every moment of the day and want to tell him that I'm interested, but I'm terrified of rejection because he never looked at people who worked with him that way and might not even realize that I'm interested.

My skin is very sensitive, and redness is my biggest issue. I was put on birth control at a very early age before I got my first period at the age of fifteen, and that's around when it first started.

I got off a hormonal IUD three years ago, and my acne peaked right after on my face and my back. I went to a dermatologist, and he recommended spironolactone, which cleared it almost all away, but I did not feel good on it, and it's not safe for pregnancy, so I stopped taking it. Since then, it's been improving slowly but has not entirely gone away. I still have some on my face and my back.

One year ago, I went to a naturopath for food-sensitivity testing. Gluten and quinoa came out as severe reactions, and some other foods had high and moderate reactions, although I am not sure how reliable these tests are. Since I got the results, I've been trying to adjust my diet to avoid these foods, but it's been hard to cut out gluten and/or dairy entirely, and I have not seen any significant improvements. I posted screenshots of my results.

I'm now three months pregnant and struggling to eat enough, so the idea of cutting out foods I enjoy is very unappealing. I currently like Dr. Jart and La Roche Posay products, but I am looking for something more effective that is fully pregnancy-safe. I would also appreciate any advice regarding my diet, lifestyle, and routines. I want to overcome this once and for all and have clear skin, so please help!
