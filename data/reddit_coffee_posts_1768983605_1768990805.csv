1qiu7qu,https://v.redd.it/ipp5lcntgoeg1,Help needed [Delonghi La Specialista Touch],"I am very new to the topic and need help.

Taste: not too bad, maybe a bit watery but my taste buds aren’t that developed yet.

Roastdate: around 2 months ago

Roaster: Gorilla Coffee

Roast level: Dark

Bean Details: it is a 50/50 blend I got in a supermarket 

Dose: 18g

Yield: 36g (38-40g if I let it drip)

Time: 36g within around 20 sec

Workflow: I use the built in grinder on number 3, the Delonghi bottomless portafilter, an aftermarket WDT Tool and Tamper. Temp in the machine is set to 90°C, Pre-Infusion set on 3 of 4. 

For what I got out of videos I know that it should be 18g in, 36g out in 25-30 sec. The grind size seems already very fine and I know that if it gets to fine I will force channeling. But how do I get the 25-30 sec if I can’t go finer? Do I already have channeling or should I try to go even finer?

I hope my post fits the regulations and rules and hopefully someone can help me.

Thanks in advance!",1,1768990586.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1qiu7o9,https://i.redd.it/5m6j1jp7foeg1.jpeg,Chef Son Jongwon interview about CCW2,"*Chef Son Jongwon interview in Esquire Korea magazine. I only posted the part where he talked about CCW2. (Brief and simplified translation, you can read the rest of his interview in the link below)*

[Esquire interview](https://www.esquirekorea.co.kr/article/1895692?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=esquire&utm_content=article)

**Q : Let's get straight to the point (talking about CCW2). Aren't you disappointed?**

**SJW** : I had a plan in my mind. At the beginning of the competition, I want to start with Western cuisine, but gradually, I want to cook dishes that lean toward Korean cuisine. The last dish will be completely Korean food base. That was the plan. But I felt sorry that I couldn't show them because I got eliminated beforehand. I wanted to show Korean food to many foreign viewers.

**Q : Many people were disappointed that Chef-nim didn't get to advance to the Carrot Hell mission.  ""What would Chef Son Jongwon, who earned Michelin stars in both Korean and French cuisine do?"" I'm curious, if you had advance (to Carrot Hell mission), what would you have done?**

**SJW** :  For the first dish, if I could use delicious winter carrot, like Jeju Gujwa carrot, I would have served a dish using carrot and tangerine.  I think I would add coffee scent/flavour to carrot soup cooked with carrot juice and adding tangerine oil for a bit of complexity. It's a menu inspired by 'Koa'.

**Q : When was your happiest or proudest moment in Culinary Class War?**

**SJW** : It was the best when we won the team match. We won by a single vote. The seniors performed very well, and since we were in the situation where big loss could turn the table, it was a crisis. I was really choked up, and Chef Choi Kang rok actually cried. Seeing him cry made me choked up again too. 4평 외톨이 (Loner in a hole in the wall) is a customer who often comes to my restaurant. I was touched when he passed the first round. He's a young chef, in some ways he's a junior chef and a person who is so genuine, I think that's why I was touched.

*Note : How I wish we can see him more in CCW2..For those who want to watch Chef Son Jongwon cooking, you can watch Chef and My Fridge in Netflix. Beside Western/French cuisines, he makes such delicates Korean cuisines, it makes me a bit sad he didn't get to show his Korean cuisine skills like what he planned to do.*",1,1768990580.0,CulinaryClassWars,0,1.0,False

Problem is, I’m a slow reader as it is. I can read quickly if I wanted to but I immediately forget what the hell I just read and I have to keep going back, but narrating in my head, giving each characters different voices and visualising the scenes makes it more enjoyable for me and I’m able to remember everything even if I go on a break for weeks.

I also always fall asleep. No matter if I’m in bed, on the couch, sitting in my car, sitting outside on a camping chair, or on public transport I will get really tired.

I’m not sure if this is relevant but I have ADHD and I’m not medicated. 

Sometimes I fight it, I’ll take a break and do something else and try to get back to it but then fall asleep, or I just let the nap take me.

I know it’s not a lack of sleep though, I get my 8 hours and I’m a very heavy sleeper, my fiancé says I don’t snore unless I’m sick and I don’t drink coffee.

Does anyone else have this problem? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Maybe not as frugal - but personally, I am pretty fancy and choosy with my coffee. I do enjoy trying different flavors, roasts etc. But I exclusively drink it at home

I got a new machine two years ago, the bean grinder I already have since 5. But I will include them in the 2 year cost breakdown. 
- Machine: 490€ 
- Bean Grinder: 150€ 

Ongoing costs:
- 1kg Fancy Beans: around 30€. At 18g per espresso that lasts 55 days, so 198€ per year. 

So with that assumption of one daily coffee (and assuming that I bought the grinder 2 years ago - and not 5), the average cost per espresso is 1.4€ so far including the machine and grinder. I usually also use a bit of milk and foam that - so that is additional 0.075€ per coffee - significantly cheaper than a cappucino everywhere. The electricity/water used is negligible. 

The next year however it will be 0.55€ per coffee, as we factored in the machine costs. Assuming a 10€ budget for some vinegar/cleaning stuff and we are about 0.57€ per espresso. If we also make some milk foam that is 0.645€. 


So we get to 0.65€ per per coffee a year - if we exclude the machine costs, which for getting coffee beans often from fairer work conditions and local roasters is very nice.",3,1768990180.0,Frugal,3,1.0,False
1qiu38h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qiu38h,Why We Need Stoicism in 2026: A Practical Guide to Modern Resilience,"In an era defined by **exponential technological shifts**, **constant digital connectivity**, and **increasing global uncertainty**, the human psyche is being tested at an unprecedented scale. As we navigate 2026, the noise of the information age often drowns out the signal of personal clarity. We find ourselves reactive rather than proactive, governed by algorithms and external events rather than internal character.

To thrive in this environment, we require more than just productivity hacks; we need a fundamental operating system for the mind. **Stoicism**, an ancient Greek philosophy refined in the halls of Roman power, provides exactly that. It is not a philosophy of emotionless indifference, but a **practical framework for maintaining agency** in a world that feels increasingly out of control.

# The Crisis of the Modern Mind: Why 2026 Demands Stoicism

The primary challenge of 2026 is the **fragmentation of attention**. Between augmented reality interfaces, AI-generated content streams, and the 24-hour news cycle, our internal peace is constantly being auctioned to the highest bidder. This leads to what psychologists often call ""decision fatigue"" and a persistent sense of low-level anxiety.

Stoicism offers an antidote through the **Dichotomy of Control**, a concept famously championed by **Epictetus** in his *Enchiridion*. He argued that some things are up to us, and some things are not. In 2026, we often exhaust our mental energy on the ""not up to us"" category—such as global market fluctuations, social media algorithms, or the opinions of strangers. By redirecting our focus exclusively to our own **judgments, intentions, and actions**, we reclaim a sense of unshakeable stability.

# The Dichotomy of Control in a Digital World

To understand how this applies to a beginner in 2026, consider the common frustration of a **slow internet connection** or a **software bug** during an important task.

* **External (Out of Control):** The speed of the network, the technical error, the provider’s outage.
* **Internal (Under Control):** Your reaction to the delay, your decision to find a workaround, and your choice not to let anger ruin your afternoon.

By internalizing this distinction, we cease to be victims of our environment. As **Marcus Aurelius** wrote in *Meditations*, ""You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."" This is not a suggestion to be passive, but an invitation to be **strategically active** where it matters most.

# Stoic Exercises for the 2026 Context

Stoicism is a ""proactive"" philosophy. It requires daily practice to build the ""mental muscles"" necessary for resilience. We recommend three core exercises tailored for the modern age.

# 1. Premeditatio Malorum (Negative Visualization)

In an age of ""toxic positivity,"" where we are told to only visualize success, the Stoics practiced the opposite. **Negative visualization** involves briefly imagining potential setbacks.

**Beginner Example:** Before going on a trip, spend one minute imagining your phone battery dying or your flight being delayed. This isn't about being pessimistic; it is about **removing the element of surprise**. When the minor inconvenience inevitably happens, you have already processed it emotionally. You remain calm while others spiral into frustration.

# 2. Voluntary Discomfort

2026 is defined by extreme convenience. We can order food, transport, and entertainment with a single gesture. While efficient, this softens our character. The Stoic practice of **voluntary discomfort** involves occasionally choosing the harder path to remind ourselves that we can survive without luxury.

**Beginner Example:** Choose to take a cold shower once a week, or walk to the grocery store instead of ordering delivery. By proving to yourself that you are okay even when things are ""less than ideal,"" you destroy the fear of future hardship.

# 3. The Evening Review

**Seneca**, one of the most prominent Roman Stoics, advocated for a nightly self-audit. In the quiet moments before sleep, we should ask ourselves:

* What did I do well today?
* Where was I governed by an impulse or an emotion?
* What could I do better tomorrow?

This practice ensures that we are **learning from our experiences** rather than simply repeating the same reactive patterns day after day.

# Stoicism vs. Modern Distraction: The Battle for Focus

The most valuable currency in 2026 is **attention**. Major corporations spend billions to capture yours. Stoicism teaches us that our attention is a sacred resource.

The Stoic concept of **Prosoche** (mindfulness or attention) is the continuous self-monitoring of one’s thoughts. When we feel the urge to reflexively check a notification or engage in an unproductive online argument, Stoicism asks us to pause. We ask: ""Is this essential?"" As Marcus Aurelius noted, most of what we say and do is not essential. By eliminating the non-essential, we gain the double benefit of doing less and doing it better.

# Resilience in the Face of Uncertainty

The future is inherently unpredictable. Whether it is the rise of new technologies or shifts in the global economy, the person who relies on external stability is always at risk. The Stoic, however, builds an **inner citadel**.

This philosophy encourages **Amor Fati**—a love of one’s fate. It is the practice of not just accepting what happens, but embracing it as fuel for growth. If a project fails, that is an opportunity to learn. If a relationship ends, that is an opportunity to practice self-sufficiency. This shift from ""Why is this happening to me?"" to ""How can I use this?"" is the ultimate mark of the modern Stoic.

# Actionable Steps

1. **Identify Your ""Uncontrollables"":** Write down three things currently causing you stress (e.g., a colleague's attitude, the economy). Formally acknowledge that these are outside your control and commit to ignoring them for 24 hours.
2. **Practice One ""Hard"" Choice:** Tomorrow morning, take a 30-second cold shower or skip your morning coffee. Notice that you are still functional and capable despite the discomfort.
3. **Set a ""Digital Sunset"":** Turn off all non-human notifications (apps, news, social media) for two hours before bed. Use this time for the **Evening Review** exercise.
4. **Read the Source Material:** Purchase a copy of Marcus Aurelius’s *Meditations* (the Gregory Hays translation is highly recommended for modern readers) and read one page per day.",1,1768990152.0,TheInnerFire,0,1.0,False

Inverted, 2 filters, course grind, 16g, 80°C,
Pour 50ml to bloom
Wait 30s 
Pour the rest up the top with number 3 mark.
Wait till 2:00
Plunge to 2:30

This one kind of worked couple times with a nice cup that I enjoyed... I did it again today exactly the same and it turned out horrible... Again watery and bitter... When i try to tweak a recipe according to information on internet (brewing compasses etc). it never works. 

TL;DR
The coffee I make is mostly not good and tweaks in recipes don't seem to alter the outcome. A good cup feels like pure luck.

2). Food alone can make it cheaper: Airport food prices can be high. In a lounge, hot meals, snacks and drinks are included, which adds up quickly when travelling as a family.  
3). Kids love the buffet: Letting kids choose what they want and go back for more is a win. No food waste panic, no ordering the 'wrong' thing, and they actually enjoy it.  
4). Quieter, calmer space: More room to sit, relax and keep everyone together, instead of hunting for seats in a busy terminal.

I had a depressive period in my life that took around 5 to 6 years and in the last 2 years I got better, however I never got a proper treatment with psychologist or psychiatrist. Recently, I realized that many of my senses have changed a lot and I don't know if it is caused by depression or it is because I'm older. For example, I can't feel smells like before. I used to love the smell of rain. It is raining outside and I can't feel nothing, then I realized how long I don't feel it. The food doesn't taste the same, however I'm addicted to junk food, so it can mess with my sense.

I also don't feel I can associate my memories to the sensations like before. I was able to have strong memories with smells and taste, like the coffee smell in a coffee shop during a trip with the family, now I can't build this type of memory.

The seconds also seem to be passing faster than before. I remember that when I was a kid, I used to count seconds, and each one seemed to take an eternity to pass. Now, I'm 30, and it is so fast that I lose the count.

I don't have the colors in my memories anymore. I used to have such vivid memories, full of colors. Actually even outside my memories, in real life, I don't feel I can see colors in the same way as before.

But… it’s also a place where first-timers can get caught out by the admin and the rules (visas, meds, photos, weekends, holy sites access, the heat).

Here’s the no-drama stuff that helped me most:

# 1) Sort visa + passport basics early

* Check your visa route for your nationality (don’t assume it’s the same for everyone).
* Make sure your passport has **6+ months validity**.
* Save your visa approval + hotel address **offline** (screenshots are your friend).

# 2) The “rules that actually matter”

* **Alcohol:** just don’t. Not worth the hassle.
* **Medication:** bring prescriptions + original packaging, and check controlled meds before you fly.
* **Photography:** avoid filming people close up without asking, and don’t photograph security/government sites.

# 3) Dress is simpler than people think

* Modest + breathable = easiest.
* Cover shoulders/knees as a default, especially outside the big city hubs.
* Pack a light layer for air-con (it’s strong).

# 4) Holy sites access affects planning

* Non-Muslims **cannot** enter the Holy Mosque area in Makkah.
* Peak religious periods can mean crowds, higher prices, and restrictions, so check timing if your route goes anywhere near there.

# 5) Heat strategy makes or breaks your itinerary

* Do outdoors **early morning + evening**.
* Midday is for museums, malls, cafés, hotel reset.
* Hydration isn’t optional. Electrolytes help.

# 6) Getting around is easier with the right setup

* Ride-hailing is the easiest for cities.
* For AlUla / remote areas, a car or driver can help.
* Make sure you’ve got data working from the airport.

# 7) First 72 hours plan (this calms everything down)

* Land → data on → ATM → ride to hotel
* Eat something easy nearby
* Short walk in a busy area
* Early night Day 2 is when you go bigger.

This isn’t about dating or romance. I really value good conversation, mutual respect, and forming connections where people can just be themselves without pressure or expectations.

I enjoy getting to know people through real conversations, sharing different perspectives, and having laughs along the way. I’m the type who appreciates both deep talks and light, everyday chats whether that’s over coffee, during a walk, or just messaging and getting to know each other naturally. I believe strong friendships are built on trust, honesty, and kindness, and I always aim to bring those values into my connections.

Making friends as an adult can be surprisingly challenging, so I’m putting myself out there with genuine intentions. If you’re open to forming a respectful, supportive friendship and enjoy meaningful conversation, I’d be happy to connect and see where a simple, friendly connection can grow.",1,1768988591.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

At the moment it’s been a few months. I am resenting him. I’m sick of making things look ok on the outside so people don’t ask questions.

My sister’s getting married, and my parents are handing her everything. 

And just to make SURE I don’t “resent my sister,” they slap a motarized document on the table in front of me.

They exchanged glances. Mom nodded at Dad.

1qitlgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qitlgb/meeting_people/,Meeting people,"Hey all,

Been reading some of the posts on here and they seem to be pretty supportive. So wanted to jump on here and talk about my situation a bit to see if I could get some advice.

Little bit of backstory. I’m 20 male, 6’3”, 170lbs and pretty lean, I lift every so often (not as much anymore) but I would like to consider myself a pretty attractive guy. I’ve got some hobbies, I do vhs videography, I like to journal a lot, I also coach youth soccer and am in my 3rd year of university.

Over the last year I’ve had a really hard time dating and meeting new people and I’m not really sure how to go about improving this. The university I go to is a commuter school in a city of around 1.3 million that is highly focused on academics. Aka school social life is dead, or at least to my experience. People are very shut off to conversation new even just trying to make new friends. Often I’ve found that most of my interactions are one-off in classes. And the new people that I do get to sort of know never really want to take it further into out of campus hangouts.

The reason why I bring this up here is because I have typically dated in the past through friends. My mindset behind it is: new circle=new dating opportunities. And honestly relationship motivation doesn’t always have to be romantic. 

Anyways. My circle isn’t growing, and it’s pushed me to spend way to much time on dating apps basically fighting to get a date with 1 girl who sparks my interest online every few months or so who ends up being so boring and never goes past the first date.

I’ve went on a couple of dates over the last year but pretty much all of them have ended horribly for some sort of reason. And recently I’ve had a couple of opportunities to go out with girls that I didn’t really find attractive. As to which I turned down as I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.

I’m a very monogamous guy and am don’t involve myself with hookup culture. And I’m not really the type of guy to cold approach very often as I don’t want to come off to strong as it honestly doesn’t feel to capture my personality as a whole. My last relationship was almost a year ago and very much so feel like I’m ready for something new. 

From my experience in my city I’ve found that many of the local bars don’t attract the sort of women I’m looking for, not are these people open for conversation anyway. I’ve recently tried journaling at a busy coffee shop once or twice a week just to get out of the house as due to the previous 3 years of the social silence at my university I’ve decided to take a semester off. Every time I’m in there I’m the youngest person by what seems like 10 years. With my soccer job I’m only around single mothers with honestly isn’t realistic (get your head out of the gutter) and university has been a dead end as to finding a girlfriend.",1,1768988354.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1qitl27,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1qitl27/parking_tips_for_robert_morris_university/,parking tips for robert morris university colonials mens hockey vs. holy cross crusaders mens college hockey at clearview arena (pittsburgh 01/24),"  
  
hey folks, figured i'd share some parking advice for the colonials game against holy cross on saturday, 01/24 at 7:00 pm. clearview arena hockey is honestly a great time, but the one real pain is getting on and especially off neville island. since the arena is on the island and only holds about 1,200 people, the issue isn't really the parking cost or space- it's the traffic backing up on grand avenue when everyone leaves at once, since access is bottlenecked by i-79 or the yellow belt.  
  
first thing, i gotta mention Prked. honestly, it's the best way to skip the official lot congestion and the whole island bottleneck. because the venue is on neville island, there aren't many alternative parking lots at all. your best bet for a super fast exit is using the Prked app to snag a local's driveway or garage right next to the rmu island sports center. even though the official lot is free, paying a little on Prked guarantees you a spot that lets you bypass the main lot's internal traffic line for a super fast jump onto the road when the game ends, and the walk is literally nothing. it is way cheaper than sitting in a traffic jam for 30 minutes.  
  
the main and official way to go is the ample free parking available on-site at the rmu island sports center. all rmu athletic events offer free parking for fans, and they have a decent amount of space right outside the main entrance of clearview arena, which is super convenient for the short walk.  
  
the biggest tip i can give if you go with the free on-site lot is all about timing and that island bottleneck. for a 7:00 pm puck drop, honestly aim to be on neville island by 6:15 pm. being early lets you snag a close free spot and miss the main traffic wave coming over the bridge right before the game. don't bother looking for street parking near the complex- it's on a sports center property, so it's not a real option like it is in the city.  
  
if you park in the main free lots, remember that getting off neville island right after the final horn can be a slow crawl. your best problem avoidance move is to hang out at the icehouse bistro for a bit and let the initial wave of cars clear out instead of sitting in the exit line. they have coffee and pub fare there, so it's a good place to wait.

[€500],"Building on my last post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qg6tou/help_me_step_away_from_the_ninja_luxe_cafe_pro/) I am now comparing the Sage Bambino, the Bambino Plus and the Legato/Apex/Hero X. Gaggia not includes as this one is 380mm, few mm too tall...

I would use the machine for both my morning cappuccino as 1 to 2 long coffees (1:4 up to 1:6), but would also like to discover new drinks.

Did I get the details right in this comparison? Some questions based on this: 

* (Adjustable) PID:
   * How important is it to be able to adjust the temperature? Also with respect to my drinks.
   * Correct that the Babino (plus) is less temperature constant when pulling longer shots?
* 3-way valve:
   * Would you miss the valve on the regular Bambino? Worth some money?
* Pre-Infusion:
   * Is the automatic pre-infusion from the bambino sufficient to soak the full puck? If so, why use the manual mode?
   * Correct that when pre-infusing manually on the bambino you can no longer use your personal pre-set volume button (for my 1:4 to 1:6 drink), and need to stop the shot yourself?
* Milk Steaming
   * Which has the best steamer?
   * 1 hole steam tip > 4 hole steam tip?
   * What is the quality of the autosteamer on the bambino plus?
* Portafilter?
   * Downsides of a 54mm?
   * Does the 54mm work well with the Eureka Mignon Specialita portafilter fork (hands-free)?",1,1768988139.0,espresso,0,0.67,False

-Testicular ultrasound
-Blood tests including chromosome test
-Hormone tests 

All came back fine. I got diagnosed with severe OAT syndrome. 0% fast motility, 5-8% slow motility (two SAs). The count was 4-5mio sperms per ml.

I'm 32, do moderate exercise 2x per week, eat relatively healthy half the week. On weekends I tend to snack quite a bit but I'm not overweight or anything.

I know it's hard to find THE reason for my numbers, but could it be my heavy weed consumption in my 20s? I still smoke but not everyday anymore and only small amounts half the week.

Before my first SA I did a 3 month break from weed and then smoked for 1,5 months, only on the weekends. Then this result came. Two months later the results were very similar. Can 1,5 months of moderate usage really cause this? Was the 3 months break not enough to normalise my numbers? I don't get it.

According to a ""RSA stress test"" my body is constantly stressed, even though I don't feel so stressed. The stressindex showed the value of ~200. I am quite sensitive to caffeine/nicotine, I only take like 5 drags of a nicotine vape per day, but I feel the ""nicotine flash"" with each drag. I drink 2-4 coffees per day and feel the effects of it too.

I cannot stop blaming myself for the heavy weed usage in my 20s. Most studies say a 30% decrease in motility is possible due to cannabis, but for me it would be a 100% decrease. Is that even possible? It is driving me nuts not knowing what caused this, whether it's the weed, the unnoticed stress, or I was simply born like this.",1,1768988114.0,maleinfertility,1,1.0,False

I’m in a rental and I’m really struggling with my kitchen’s space and the functionality 😫. I’d love some of your help please… 

My two main issues are:

1. Severely limited counter space to cook.. 
2. Poor dining/work height and cluttered storage because of a vintage table that’s too low, plus a bulky kitchen cabinet that’s too heavy and blocks the space needed for chairs. And housing coffee machine which creates too much clutter (in my opinion).

I’m considering a kitchen island with a table attached (like a rectangular style) so I can have some seating, but I’m open to all ideas.
How can I make it function better and improve the flow? Photos of the current kitchen layout are attached for context.

1qitd2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/1qitd2w/sparkles_spec_a_emoji_toy_language_with_structure/,"Sparkles Spec, a Emoji toy language with structure.","I recently discovered that people create languages for fun on another subreddit (randomthoughts). I found it fascinating, so I wanted to try and develop my own toy language. The toy language would focus on emojis and how to turn them into an elegant language without ambiguity. 

Thus, for the last 6 hours (with the help of AI), I have been on a quest to creating a quirky language that does just that. Reiteration after iteration and adjusting each version to the design that I had in my head, I ended up with the final Sparkle Script. It tries to combine emojis with japanese language structures. It attempts this through the use of sentence structure and particles. 

At the end, I wasn't sure I was happy with the complexity. I'm unsure if I achieved the end result of removing ambiguity enough for people to come to the same shared meaning. And surprisingly enough, I didn't imagine it would become as complex as it did, lol. 

  
I included the Sparkle Script to discuss what does it do right and wrong so far? If you understood the spec enough, do you think you could reliably convey the meaning to other Sparkle users, or do you think it's just too contextual still and open to too many interpretations? Without a strictly defined emoji list, will there always be multiple versions to express the same concept? 

Not sure if this will be considered low-effort, AI slop, and removed, but I will take that risk. I just got into this today, lol, so this is the best that I've got. I think if I removed the example Script, the discussion would still be interesting, so it should be good, I think. With that said, my current goal is to create a toy language to flex the brain muscles a bit in a fun way. 

  
Thanks, 



# ✨ Sparkle Script Specification (v4.0)

**Motto:** *Visual Meaning. Structural Logic. Universal Ease.*

# 1. The Core Philosophy

**Sparkle Script** is a **Visual-Logic** language. It strips away complex conjugation and spelling, replacing them with universal symbols (Emojis) and a rigid, predictable structural skeleton (English Particles).

* **Order:** Always Subject-Object-Verb (SOV).
* **Content:** Always Emojis (Single or Compound).
* **Grammar:** Always English Particles.
* **Tone/Punctuation:** Always Emojis (❓, ✨, ❗, 💭, 🙏).

# 2. Sentence Architecture (SOV)

The meaning flows from the **Topic** through the **Context** to the final **Result**.

>**Order:** `[Topic]` **as** `[Context/Object]` **\[Particle\]** `[Verb/State]` **\[Aspect/Tense/Mood\]** **do/is**.

# 3. Contextual Fluidity: The ""Chameleon"" Rule

In Sparkle Script, an emoji is a **semantic cluster**. Its specific meaning (Noun, Verb, or Adjective) is locked in by the **Grammar Particle** that follows it.

# 3.1 Role Determination (The 🔥 Example)

The particle acts as the ""lens"" that focuses the emoji's meaning into a specific part of speech.

* **The State Marker (**`is`**):** Defines the emoji as a **Noun** or **Adjective**.
   * 🍱 `as` 🔥 `is`. (The meal **is hot**.)
* **The Action Marker (**`do`**):** Defines the emoji as a **Verb**.
   * 👤 `as` 🍱 `object` 🔥 `do`. (I **heat up/cook** the meal.)
* **The Method/Place Marker (**`at`**):** Defines the emoji as a **Tool** or **Location**.
   * 👤 `as` 🔥 `at` 😋 `do`. (I eat **by means of** fire/cooking.)

# 3.2 Expanded ""Chameleon"" Examples

|Emoji|With `is` (State/Noun)|With `do` (Action/Verb)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**🚿**|It is a shower / It is wet.|To wash / To shower.|
|**❄️**|It is cold / It is ice.|To freeze / To chill.|
|**📖**|It is a book.|To read / To study.|
|**👁️**|It is an eye / It is sight.|To look / To see.|

# 4. The Triangulation Method

Use these three points to decode ambiguous emojis:

1. **The Particle:** Does it end in `do` (action) or `is` (state)?
2. **The Compound:** Does the emoji before it modify the meaning? (🌊+🏦 = River Bank).
3. **The Topic:** Does the `as` topic set the ""world""? (👨‍🍳 topic makes 🔪 a kitchen tool).

# 5. Compound Emoji Logic

**\[Modifier\] + \[Core\]**. The last emoji is the main category.

* **Identity:** 🎨 + 🧑 = Artist.
* **Concept:** 🖖 🎬 + 🧠 = Sci-Fi Philosophy.
* **Disambiguation:** 🏦💰 = Money Bank, 🏦🪑 = Bench

# 18. Common Mistakes & Disambiguation

# 18.1 Particle Confusion

❌ **Wrong:** 👤 `as` 🏠 `object` 🏃 `do`.  
✅ **Right:** 👤 `as` 🏠 `to` 🏃 `do`. (I go **to** home.)

*Mistake: Using* `object` *for destination instead of* `to`*.*

# 18.2 Emoji Ambiguity

When an emoji has multiple meanings, use compounds:

* 🏦💰 = Bank (financial)
* 🏦🪑 = Bank (riverside bench)
* 🏦🌊 = River bank

# 18.3 Tense Stacking Order

❌ **Wrong:** 🏃 `can` `did` `do`.  
✅ **Right:** 🏃 `did` `can` `do`. (Was able to run.)

*Remember: ASPECT → TENSE → MODALITY → NEGATION*

# 18.4 Bracket Overuse

Only use brackets when a full clause acts as an object:

❌ **Wrong:** 👤 `as` \[ ☕ \] `object` 🤲 `want`.  
✅ **Right:** 👤 `as` ☕ `object` 🤲 `want`.

*Simple objects don't need brackets.*

I'm dating a girl for 4 months, we're clicking really well, so far there are no issues, we're also very communicative, she's respectful and is really into me (as I'm into her), so relationship is good and loving. 

She knows my friends and in the beginning I immediately scheduled a double date with my female best friend and her boyfriend. sometimes I meet friends alone for a coffee or so but sometimes I invite her along, for example when I'm invited by friends to hit a bar.

she knows many of my friends and this is how I've always been in my life and think it's normal.

She has a male best friend for over 15 years. she says they've always met alone, she never met him with any of her friends or exes, as well as he.

She says she has a deep connection with him because he's also esoteric so they speak about spiritual stuff.

I knew this from the beginning and last week I thought ""I wanna meet him too, I wanna be part of my gfs life"", so I suggested a double date with him and his girlfriend, that it would be cool so I can finally meet this amazing person she talks so much about. 

she immediately blocked it off, said that they never did this and she's not sure what to think of it and will think of a solution because she's unsure of it.

I'm confused, if everything is platonic what would be the issue? People can meet privately no problem, I also meet my best friend one-on-one sometimes. But we also meet all together, I can't understand how that would be a problem.

The worst part is I found out 3 years ago he hit on her when they were both drunk in a bar. she told me nothing ever happened, she's put a boundary on him and even avoided him for months before meeting again. She told me she also only sees him as a friend.

But I can't help but feel unease about this. How would you deal with the situation? I feel like our relationship can start to deteriorate because of this in the future.

EDIT: to clarify, she also presents me to her other friends, I've known almost all her other friends without issues. She's acting this way only with him. 

EDIT 2: I saw him once accidentally when picking her up after they met in a bar, said hello and that's it.",1,1768987229.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

Evening walks
Coffee or dinner conversations
Talking about life, work, mental health, or just random stuff
This isn’t a business or promotion — just an idea to see if others feel the same and would like genuine human connection without pressure or expectations.

Am I misreading behavior that feels at times intentionally jealousy provoking or possibly emotional manipulation?","I am a 49F in a 9 month committed, monogamous relationship with a 30M. This relationship was unexpected. I was honestly just looking for something light and fun, but it became serious quickly. He frequently tells me that he loves me and that I am the love of his life and his world. He calls me his girlfriend, has introduced me to his parents, and says he is all in.

I am not looking for judgment about the age gap. I did not seek it out and I am genuinely trying to understand the dynamic rather than defend it.

What I am struggling with are recurring situations involving other women that leave me feeling unsettled and confused. He maintains close relationships with multiple exes and female friends, many of whom still seem very emotionally attached to him. In fact, he has characterized several of these relationships himself as the women being still hung up on with him, one of which apparently cried when he told her he had a date with me... and has since moved away because she said it was too painful to live in the same city where he lived (according to him). This all adds to my confusion about boundaries and emotional clarity.

One situation recently really shook me. A close female friend (we will call her Amy) was visiting from out of town but staying elsewhere. They went out drinking one night, and she ended up sleeping over at his place. He did not tell me this at the time, even though we were texting that night and had plans to get coffee and go on a hike the next morning. He texted me “good morning” as usual.

When I was driving over the next morning, I called him and did not get an answer. I called again and he picked up. When I said I was on my way, he said would I be fine hanging out with Amy because she was still there, that she had slept over. I felt very uncomfortable and said I did not feel okay coming over... he asked why and kept saying come. When I hung up the phone, I felt sick to my stomach. 

Later, when we talked about it, I asked whether she slept in his bed and he said yes. I asked if anything sexual happened and he said no. He explained that they have been close friends for 12 years, are very close, and that this kind of closeness is normal for them. He also said that they sometimes cuddle and that physical touch is their love language. (side note. they did hook up a long time ago and supposedly haven't since)

What unsettled me most was that he seemed to anchor on the idea that he thought I would be fine with it, rather than really engaging with how it actually felt for me. He referenced the fact that I had met her and seemed comfortable with their friendship as justification, which felt less like misunderstanding and more like defensiveness or a need to be right. I still don't feel settled about this and though we have talked about it... it feels almost nauseating to bring up another time now. 

I want to add that while his words toward me are very loving and committed, they sometimes feel disproportionate or disconnected from the reality of the relationship and the complexity of what we are navigating. He is a very attractive and successful man, and while I have been told I am attractive as well, I sometimes find myself confused about what he is actually seeking in this dynamic. I do know that he has historically been attracted to older women, so this may simply be his preference, but I am not sure what that means in the context of everything else. I recognize this may be a separate issue, but it adds to my overall sense of dissonance.

This is not the only situation involving other women or exes that has left me feeling unsettled, but this was the clearest and most recent example. I want to be clear that I was completely fine with them spending time together, and I believe I would have been okay with her staying over if he had told me beforehand and if there were clearer boundaries aka she slept on the sofa, for instance. What has been hardest is the lack of transparency and the way I found out.

I am trying to understand whether I am overreacting or projecting my own sensitivities, whether this could be an age related or generational difference in boundaries, or whether these patterns reasonably raise concerns about emotional manipulation or jealousy provoking behavior, even if unintentionally. At times it feels like he enjoys when I get jealous, which is unsettling to me.

I am not trying to control his friendships or isolate him from people, but I am finding myself increasingly dysregulated and second guessing my instincts. At the same time, his words toward me are very loving and committed, which makes this feel confusing and contradictory. 

Something has shifted for me emotionally since this happened and these conversations. I feel myself pulling back. I feel guarded. There has been other stuff, but this one feels big. 

I am also struggling with the role I feel I am being cast in. The dynamic increasingly makes me feel like the jealous older girlfriend, and that role feels deeply uncomfortable and unsustainable to me. I am trying to understand whether this discomfort is something I need to work through internally, or whether it is telling me something important about the health and structure of this relationship.

I would really appreciate grounded perspectives on whether this behavior would concern others in a committed, monogamous relationship and how to interpret what is happening without becoming either controlling or self erasing. And also how to shake this jealous gf role I feel I am being forced into. 



**TL;DR:** I’m a 49F in a 9-month committed, monogamous relationship with a 30M who is very verbally loving and says he is all in. I’m struggling with repeated boundary issues involving close female friends and exes, particularly one recent incident where a female friend slept in his bed without my knowledge after a night of drinking, despite us having plans the next morning. He claims nothing happened physically, but he did not understand why this affected trust or emotional safety and seemed defensive rather than attuned. I’m trying to understand whether I’m overreacting, whether this is an age or generational boundary difference, or whether this dynamic is unhealthy and pushing me into a role that feels intolerable to me.",0,1768986340.0,relationship_advice,7,0.4,False

The $100 charge threw me off, and all I could think was that it was some type of fraud, and maybe someone had tested it first for a few dollars then somehow withdrew 100.  I forgot I bought a coffee and got gas that day.  Now I see the 100 was probably just a pre authorization charge.

We finally got our interview notice for next month and the nerves are starting to set in. I’m hoping to get some perspective from anyone who had a relatively quick turnaround between a divorce and a remarriage, or anyone who didn't have the ""standard"" joint lease and bank accounts.

​For context, I was previously married for nine years. My ex and I separated in March 2024, but the divorce wasn't legally finalized until January 1, 2025. I met my current husband shortly after that—it was a total accident on Facebook that started as a casual coffee date and just evolved naturally from there. We got married in October 2025, so I’m worried that the nine-month gap between my divorce and remarriage might look like a red flag, even though I was emotionally separated from my ex for a while before remarrying.

​Our financial evidence also feels a bit ""thin"" compared to the checklists I see online. I own my home outright, so there’s no lease to add him to. We decided to stay in my house, and we just split the bills down the middle. We also both own our cars with no loans, and we don't have any joint debt or shared credit cards. We even skipped the big wedding for a courthouse ceremony because we’re prioritizing our savings for surrogacy to start a family.

​Right now, our main evidence is that I’m on his health insurance, we share car insurance, and we have plenty of photos from vacations and our time together.  Has anyone dealt with a similar situation where you had a recent divorce or lacked the ""big"" documents like a joint mortgage or lease?

it's so easy to just imagine the characters from a different fandom in the TG world.

Reason 2: the desk was empty with no laptop or bag or belongings.

Reason 3: In my previous job, they used to provide free bottles and keep them next to coffee machine albeit not somewhere on monitor desk.

Today i asked another colleague who joined at the same time whose more outspoken and prolly asked about water bottles to someone.

Tifu by stealing water bottles that you have to pay….

should i come clean to that person?!

TL;DR: I’m on day 4 of my new job and accidentally been STEALING PAID WATER BOTTLES

People were asking more details.

Edit 1: To clarify, My company uses a third-party vendor for paid snacks/water, they gave access to them for selling snacks food sandwiches (small stuff) and WATER.

The thrid party vendor was in my previous company too but previous company provided good amount of free stuff already.

Also where my father works- they have soooo many stuff for free like multiple different machines for coffee  + milk + fruits and occasionally they bring variety of snack items.

Edit 2: Honestly the best way is to be anonymous, I will silently replace the stolen goods with a small sticky note",48,1768984877.0,tifu,26,0.84,False

\---

Two barbells, two hundred fifty kilograms in rusty 1.25 to 20 kilograms plates, a red power rack for squats with a pull-up bar, an adjustable Olympic bench, and even a purple yoga mat. Later in the bedroom’s wardrobe, I discovered neatly folded black and red shorts and T-shirts, and a pair of black elevated-heel weightlifting shoes in my size.  
I was certain I hadn’t vocalised my wish. Something was listening directly to my mind.

I had been stuck here for more than two months – on my little island of solitude, floating into the abyss.  
Part of my mind had concluded that the architect of this cage had forgotten about me, and that I was freeloading until they’d come back from vacations or whatever. But the house had answered to my desire. Something was listening. Something was watching.  
I wondered if I should be frightened, but concluded that I was already helpless. Giving up another layer of freedom – the privacy of my mind – didn’t hurt so bad. To the contrary, it meant there was someone else. Against my own will, this realisation lifted my mood. Over all this time, and even longer, more than freedom, I had been craving company.

Trying to make sense of this revelation, I sipped on another creamy coffee sitting in the front yard. A battle raged in my mind: resentment against loneliness. I looked up into the void and searched for something.  
The balmy white mug progressively cooled down in my hands. The base of my neck began to pinch.  
Finally, the winner voiced a shy ‘Thank you… I guess.’

Over the next two weeks, I let myself talk to the house.  
‘Good morning, house.’  
‘How is the weather today? Our favourite shade of abyssal dark again?’  
‘Should I have my coffee black or with milk? How do you usually take yours?  
‘What’s your PR on a bench, house? I am sure you’d put me to shame.’  
‘What should we listen to tonight? The radio or… the radio? Exactly! We should turn on the radio.’  
‘OK, house, you are right. I have been procrastinating long enough. Tonight, we start reading The Lord of the Rings. Would you like me to read it aloud? Nah, I am silly. You can read my mind.’  
It never answered. But, instead of driving me crazy, these little conversations alleviated some of the loneliness.

One night, after Froddo parted ways with the Fellowship, I felt deeply forlorn. I craved for a friend. A brave Samwise Gamgee, a Gollum, or even a cat. Honestly, anything alive and moving. I went to bed, my heart aching.  
‘Good night, house. I hope at least you don’t feel lonely.’  
The next morning, I woke up to my usual routine. I wished a heartfelt ‘Good morning’ to the house, flipped the side lamp on, let my body slip out of my cruelly cushy bed, dressed in my gym attire, drank water – tremendously important – and opened the front door.  
The light pole clicked on and glowed its eerie white light.  
‘Good morning, light poOOOOOH MY GOD!’  
I jumped back in, slammed the door shut. My hands fumbled frantically on the door, looking for a lock.  
‘House! How do you lock the door? House?!’  
I pressed both hands on the entrance as hard as I could and prayed. My heart pounded so hard it drummed in my ears. I pressed and pressed and pressed and… nothing happened.  
I took a deep breath and let go of the door. I walked past the couch and looked through the radius window in the living room. The thing hadn’t moved.  
Behind the light pole, at the edge of the island, sat a three-metre-wide horizontally stretched oval mass of moving appendages. It had a juniper green colour – like the light pole – with a purple flowing glimmer. Floating from its centre, an innumerable number of one to two metres long appendages distorted back and forth between tentacle-like and tree-like shapes, splitting and fusing. At the base of its tentacles, an abundance of obsidian would-be eyes – evoking lava lamps – continuously emerged and vanished in the mass. The thing evoked a much less plausible Hermaeus Mora, from Skyrim.

I spent the rest of the day at the window, gazing at the improbable creature.  
In my months trapped here, my brain had anchored a sense of safety in the house. This episode completely shattered it. I stared at the many-appendage-thing at the edge of my world, my mind falling into madness. I cried, laughed, drooled, fell and cradled myself on the floor.  
After hours of frenzy, a feeling of rage grew in my chest. I refused to die here. I grabbed a cleaver and a chef's knife from the kitchen, stormed out, stood at the pole, and screamed as loud as I could, not just at the thing, but at my own fear.

The morphing mass slid back a meter.

1qisk2d,https://i.redd.it/etco8qbqyneg1.png,Zhipu AI released GLM-Image — an open-source image gen model that can actually render text properly,"Zhipu AI just dropped GLM-Image, and the main thing that sets it apart is that it doesn't turn text into unreadable gibberish.  
  
**Architecture:**  
Autoregressive generator (9B params) + diffusion decoder (7B params)  
Hybrid approach combining both methods  
  
**What it does well:**  
Best text rendering among open-source image models (scored highest on CVTG-2K benchmark)  
Text-to-image and image-to-image generation  
English and Chinese support  
I2I features: editing, stylization, identity preservation, multi-subject consistency  
  
**Why this matters:**  
Most open-source image models still completely butcher text. If you've tried generating UI mockups, game textures with readable signs, posters, or concept art with labels, you know the pain.  
GLM-Image is apparently the first open model whose text quality actually comes close to closed solutions like Seedream and Nano Banana. So now you can generate:  
  
UI mockups with readable button labels  
In-game textures with legible signs  
Posters and interfaces that don't look like alien hieroglyphics  
Concept art with actual words on it

To start, I've always been a light sleeper but never noticed any problem going to sleep or staying asleep. By day 4, I noticed my sleep quality deteorating, but stuck it out. I do have a ton more energy and focus, but nothing that a cup of coffee won't do for me. I've been very fortunate to not experience many other side effects besides some very occasional dizziness/vertigo, however, this insomnia might be a deal breaker for me. 

Since day 4, I've gotten less than 6 hours of sleep a night, with each night significantly worse than the last. I've slept for maybe 2.5 hours tonight and I have work in the morning. I don't think there's any way I can make this work for me because even though I'm exhausted/tired (used to work nightshift and this is what it feels like but worse) my sleeping feels like I just closed my eyes and pretended to sleep. I've tried melatonin, magnesium, benadryl, no caffeine at all since I started, taking it as early as I can. Nothing really seems to help.

1qisj94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1qisj94/bubba_gump_shrimp/,Bubba Gump Shrimp,"Mama always said
life is like a box of chocolates,
and I believed her,
’cause I never knew
what kind of day I’d get
or who I’d end up loving.

People look at me funny sometimes,
like they’re tryin’ to measure
how smart I am
by how fast I talk
or how big my words are.
But Mama said
smart don’t always shout.
Sometimes it just listens real good.

I might not know
how the stars line up
or why folks argue so much
about things they can’t change,
but I know when someone’s hurting,
and I know when a smile is real
or just borrowed for the day.

That’s a kind of smart too,
even if it don’t come with a diploma
or a fancy chair to sit in.

I know love.
Not the movie kind
where the music swells just right
and nobody’s got bills to pay.
I know the kind
that waits in parking lots,
that holds hands in silence,
that stays even when the magic
feels a little tired.

Love is when you remember
how someone takes their coffee
even when they say it don’t matter.
Love is when you stay up late
worried about someone
who’s already asleep.
Love is choosing kindness
even when you could be right instead.

I’ve loved with scraped knees
and open palms.
Loved with all my weight,
even when my heart
didn’t know how to land softly.
Loved people who stayed
and people who left,
and I learned something
from both kinds.

Mama said love is like running —
you don’t always know
where you’re going,
you just know
you gotta keep moving forward.
So I ran toward people,
ran toward hope,
ran toward the idea
that being gentle
isn’t the same as being weak.

Some folks think smart men
don’t feel this much.
But I think feeling this much
is the smartest thing I ever did.
’Cause loving someone
means you finally understand
that life ain’t just about you
and never really was.

I may say the wrong thing
at the wrong time.
I may miss the joke
or take things too literal.
But when I love,
I love honest,
like a promise I don’t forget to keep.

So if you ask me
what love is,
I won’t give you a dictionary answer.
I’ll tell you it’s showing up,
even when you’re tired.
It’s choosing someone
again and again
without keeping score.

And if that don’t make me a smart man,
well…
Mama always said
you don’t need to prove
what you already know.

And I know love. 💛",2,1768984334.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

1qisf7c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qisf7c,Stop switching between 5 tools just for one Influencer. A new 'Unified Character' workflow for consistent UGC.,"# Step 1: The ""Identity Lock"" Phase

Don't just prompt a random person. Use the **One Unified Character Builder** (your Free AI Influencer Studio) to define your influencer's baseline.

* **The Action:** Select one of the **10 prebuilt characters** or use the **Mix Presets** feature to merge two personas (e.g., merging a 'lifestyle' preset with a 'tech' preset) to create a unique, one-of-a-kind face.
* **Pro Tip:** This prevents you from looking like every other ""AI Influencer"" on the timeline.

# Step 2: Fine-Tuning with 100+ Parameters

Once the base face is set, move to the **Creative Parameters**.

* **The Action:** Adjust skin tone, body type, and specific physical traits. Since the platform has **no predefined ""normal,""** push the sliders to create a relatable, ""imperfect"" person that feels like a real UGC creator rather than a supermodel.

# Step 3: The Prompt Edit ""Refine"" Loop

Instead of starting over if the image isn't perfect, use the **Prompt Editing Workflow**.

* **The Action:** Generate the initial UGC-style image (e.g., ""Influencer holding a coffee in a kitchen""). If the lighting or outfit is off, **edit the prompt directly** on that image to refine it until it matches your brand vision exactly.

# The next steps are about converting your image into a living, breathing personality.

# Step 4: Expressive Motion (HD Output)

Now, bring the character to life using the **Motion Engine**.

* **The Action:** Animate your refined character to generate up to **30 seconds of HD video**.
* **Realism Hack:** Because the motion is ""expressive and controlled,"" focus on micro-expressions (eye blinks, slight head tilts) to sell the UGC ""selfie-style"" authenticity.

# Step 5: Scaling for Viral Growth

Repeat the process using the same **Unified Character** profile for different scripts.

* **The Action:** Since you aren't ""tool-switching,"" you can churn out a week's worth of content in one session, keeping the character's face and body 100% consistent across every clip.",0,1768983899.0,influencermarketing,4,0.17,False
