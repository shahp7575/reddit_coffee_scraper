I sent it through the Fox program feedback form but I suspect it will just get read by AI. I‚Äôm just really excited to share this and I don‚Äôt care how lame this is. If I were someone behind the scenes, I‚Äôd want to know that I‚Äôm not just holding a boom mic or helping contestants with wardrobe or creating a graphic that will be seen for less than a second. All of that created a thing that forced an otherwise useless person to question how they think and now that person is thriving. Idk ‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt that be nice to know? Make things feel less meaningless? 

Thanks guys! 

Letter: 
Not hyperbole - playing The Floor at home saved my life. This is just a heartfelt thank you and I hope it finds someone. 

This silly game show allowed me to realize a severe cognitive impairment, address its root cause, and then see real results in terms of response time. The most significant snowball effect I‚Äôve ever experienced. 

I‚Äôm not looking for anything - I just hope this actually finds someone who has a hand in the creation of this show. To know that what may just feel like a job, has had a life-changing effect on one person. My motives are also to try to give other people the opportunity to use this show as a tool for understand how their own brain works. 

I‚Äôm a 36 year old female who‚Äôd been bound to high doses of psych meds (Effexor and adderall) my whole adult life. I‚Äôd tried everything - countless regular psychiatric visits, addressing addiction, trauma, CBT, and sadly multiple attempts on my own life. 

Then I started watching this game show. I noticed a significant delay in my response time to visual clues vs. text clues. My insatiable curiosity lead me to learn how I process information. I found my brain works a little differently than most in that it prefers verbal processing over visual. 

This allows me to organize things in mind like you‚Äôd see in a spreadsheet whereas most brains organize things like a photo album. It allows me to spot relationships between things that may not be obvious by just comparing images. Also lets me learn a little more efficiently. 

My memories occur in third person perspective because my brain prioritizes the concrete facts first (where, when) then reconstructs the scene for me - which explains the delayed response time to visual clues. 

Having this knowledge gave me a better understanding of how I process thoughts. It reframed my entire perspective. 

The brain is a complex system but all complex systems can be broken down into simple parts. I stopped taking my meds cold turkey to see if I could dissociate from the psychological symptoms. Understanding how I process thoughts and what chemical reactions occur and how they occur allowed me to harness the power of my mind. 

I now have mental clarity. Before, I wasn‚Äôt able to string together a thought - my working memory was failing me and I honestly valued life just as much as death because of how frustrating communication was.

As I watch each week, my response times for visual clues (aside from people, still figuring that out) has been improving dramatically. 

I‚Äôm getting real tangible results. My memory is back and I‚Äôm actually living life for the first time. I‚Äôll never again question whether or not life is worth living. I‚Äôll never again wonder how people get out of bed everyday. 

Anyone who‚Äôs involved in this show - thank you. From the creators to the intern getting coffee - all contributed to - very literally - saving a life. I can‚Äôt express this enough. 

I have my life back. I have my mind back. I have a purpose. 

All thanks in part to whoever is reading this. 

Forever grateful,

Recently I've found myself starting to resent the amount of effort my wife puts into her newfound volunteering opportunities at the kids' school, particularly PTA. I'm the breadwinner, and I also pride myself on being an active an present father and husband as much as I possibly can. I do nearly all the housework and do as much as I can to care for the kids when I'm not working. My wife works part time but otherwise doesn't have anything on her plate. At least she used to not have anything on her plate. Most days she'd be home while the kids were at school watching TV or going to coffee or lunch with friends. She'd occasionally work from home a few hours here or there. I've never asked her for much, but she'd typically handle most of the grocery shopping and meal planning (we split cooking duties) as well as getting the kids to and from school. Outside of that, she'd have 4-5 hours of free time every day.

I've often struggled with doing basically all the housework and as much childcare as I could. I have \*zero\* time for myself to pursue my own hobbies or social engagements. I struggle to find the time - and quite frankly the emotional discipline - to even workout regularly. I feel burned out beyond belief trying to keep the house livable while working a high pressure job and being the bedrock for my family. While my wife has the opportunity to see friends multiple times a week, including sometimes going to dinner or happy hour, I'm working myself into the ground to keep up with everything.

I've been struggling with this for a while, long before my wife started volunteering with PTA and kids' school stuff. Now don't get me wrong, I'm happy that she's found something to engage with at her leisure. I realize I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to offer her that opportunity. I've always encouraged her to have a life outside of just being Mom, and this is the first engagement that she seems truly excited about.

The problem is that PTA and similar stuff is now taking up so much of her time and emotional bandwidth that now I need to do EVEN MORE to keep the household running. I now do much of the grocery shopping and nearly all the cooking, often skirting the lines with my work schedule to keep up. She's gone 2-3 evenings per week with PTA and similar stuff she's taken on if not more. It feels like I'm approaching single parent status here. On top of that, she gives so much to these other things that she no longer has anything to give back to us. She's now less patient with the kids (personally I think this is a good things, as she used to have a hard time saying no to them), less patient with me, and just emotionally drained all the time. It feels like this new stuff gets like 60% of her emotional bandwidth, the kids get 39%, and the house gets 1%. None left for our marriage.

So to recap, I went from doing most things while she enjoyed plenty of free time every day, to now I'm doing nearly everything and she's less present when she finally collapses on the couch after a long day. She has less patience overall, and it feels like she's putting next to zero effort into our marriage. I'm growing resentful that she can muster so much enthusiasm and make so much time for PTA and similar stuff, while totally deprioritizing our marriage and home life.

So I'm here looking for advice. How can I approach this conversation with her without her just getting mad at me and shutting down? Is it even reasonable for me to ask her to do more for our marriage and home life and to step back a little bit from this other stuff she's now doing? If I'm being totally unreasonable, then how can I deal with my own resentment to prevent it from ruining my marriage?

TL;DR - My wife now fully dedicates herself to things other than our marriage and home life. I feel like I shoulder nearly 100% of the responsibility for providing this life and keeping the house running. Is it fair to ask her to reassess her priorities to save me from resentment, or am I just being a jealous jerk?",1,1740686466.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Arch degree and graduating this June, and have been consistently applying for jobs since November, averaging around 25 to 50 a week. I've been applying to both local small firms and large firms as well, both local and across the US, writing cover letters manually without using AI or ChatGPT, and restructuring my portfolio and work samples to be relevant to the different kinds of jobs I am applying to.

I understand there are a whole host of problems with the circumstances - the market is uncertain, I spent my summers researching instead of doing architectural internships, etc. so I lost out on 3 years of Revit, but how do I approach networking?

I saw that common advice given in these threads is to approach professionals for coffee chats and get to know them as mentors, but to also be careful not to do it in a way that makes them think you see them as a ticket to a job.

I have made a few connections (like 3 or 4 of these) over the past few years, but I can't tell if they're just being gentle when they say their firms aren't hiring new grads because the covid interns are only just now learning the ropes, or if I/my portfolio am the problem, and if so, what can I do?

The people I've met at job fairs, awards events, etc are nice and cordial, and I've sent thank you emails to people I met that reviewed my stuff there, but I'm not sure how to really broach the coffee chats or where else I'd organically meet people to network with. 

It feels especially because I'm about to graduate that whatever I do will come through as if there's this ulterior motive, even if I am just seeking a casual chat.

1izowtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1izowtg/buyers_remorse/,Buyer‚Äôs Remorse,"Last summer we bought a new build house on some land in rural TN. We are originally from IL and lived in the Houston suburbs for 4 years. We moved after we had our first baby. The move stressed me out obviously because I was so early postpartum. And then we discovered the builder drained the AC condensation pipe into the wall causing water under the floors and mold. Builder fixed it and insurance took care of repairs. Mold test came back fine. We had it remediated but we lived in a hotel and with IL family for 3 weeks. It was probably the most stressful and hopeless time of my life. Got everything fixed and have been living there since. But I didn‚Äôt realize how isolating having a baby would make me feel. And how much I would just want to drive 5-10 mins away to go through a drive through or walk at a park. We are on a backroad in the middle of the woods, and it feels like a hassle to just drive 5 mins away to our small park and coffee shop. We are 50 mins away from the nearest Aldi or an actual park with disc golf and stuff we like to do. I really miss our location in Houston. We had everything there, and I wanted to be rural with land until I had a baby and just wanted everything to be close and easy. And familiar. We still are trying to sell our Houston house. Moving back would be a pain in the neck, and we moved to TN to be closer to family for the sake of our kids. And I feel like we‚Äôd be in the same boat if we moved back, feeling like we‚Äôre far from family and visiting is a hassle. Husband suggests we just move again closer to a bigger area or city in TN. But the thought of that sounds horrible, especially looking forward to more pregnancies and children. I just feel lost and stuck, and the thought of dealing with selling and buying again.

- Skin & Hair Issues
My scalp is flaky, oily, and feels like it has acne. I‚Äôve tried so many anti-dandruff treatments and changed how often I wash my hair, but nothing helps.
I‚Äôm losing quite a bit of hair, especially in the shower and around my hairline. My body hair also grows quite slowly and in patches (I basically shave every 3 weeks while I know some people shave every 3 days or even every day) 
My nails are weak, thin, and break easily.

- Fatigue & Energy Levels
I‚Äôm constantly tired, no matter how much I sleep (4 or 12 hours). Even with multiple coffees, I feel exhausted.
I get headaches every day not just mild ones, but pounding headaches that make me feel nauseous.

- Hunger & Digestion
Lately, I‚Äôve been extremely hungry all the time. I eat full meals, snack constantly, crave sugar, and still don‚Äôt feel full.
I‚Äôve tried diets, calorie deficits, and intermittent fasting, but nothing lasts. My glucose tests were fine as I was worried about diabetes. I also sometimes, feel like throwing up after eating.
Some days, I feel okay, but most times, I feel extremely bloated and I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it but I feel like my fat is crushing my ribs. It doesn‚Äôt make sense because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm overweight enough for that to happen, but it does.
Sometimes, my heart hurts too, though I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related.

- Reproductive & Pelvic Health
Recently, I‚Äôve noticed pimples near my labia and what might be a Bartholin‚Äôs cyst. It comes and goes more frequently now, despite keeping the area clean and dry.
My periods aren‚Äôt regular but I wouldn‚Äôt say they are irregular. I use an app to somewhat track it and it says I have a 36-day cycle. I hardly get my period on the day it suggests but roughly around the timeline however my last one was 63 days. 
I‚Äôve also noticed more discharge than before.
Additionally I think I might have piles, I‚Äôve had excess skin near my anus since childhood, but never really thought more about until recently . I tried Daflon for a week, but nothing changed.


I am anaemic and live in a country with very crap options of vegetable so don‚Äôt have a lot of fibre intake (I don‚Äôt have very good bowel activity) so yeah.
Honestly, all of this makes me feel pretty crap and embarrassed and it‚Äôs affecting my confidence. Not sure what to do or what‚Äôs worth looking into, but I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice and your kindness.

1izost3,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1izost3/eternal_dream/,Eternal dream,"Woke up this morning and had a vision of you burnt into the back of my mind. Your gorgeous eyes, soft smirk, it was the first time in a long time I awoke with a rapid beating heart. 

You‚Äôre on of those people who never leave thought, like a ghost that haunts the world I see once my eyes are closed. The world when my eyes are open, I see you in everything. 

This sounds so surface level, but we both know it delves deeper than that. The way you talk, it‚Äôs magnetic. You draw everyone around you in, everyone listens, enjoys what they hear. You‚Äôre understanding, more so than most, it‚Äôs like you can tap into the minds of those you speak to, strangers on a sidewalk, in a coffee shop, grocery store; you know exactly what to say. One could look at this and think it‚Äôs manipulation, false charisma, but I know you better than that. Your heart is so pure, genuine, loving. Everything you do is complete with finesse and passion. A lot of people look up to you, you‚Äôre just **that** good at what you do! 

I imagine your mind to be electric, intelligence speaks for itself, how incredibly smart and sophisticated you are to have gotten to the point in life you‚Äôre at now. Hardworking, dedicated, talented. 

Whenever I say you‚Äôre beautiful, I don‚Äôt just mean it on the outside. Of course, I think you‚Äôre an absolute angel, but the way in which you talk, walk, speak, think, do. Everything about you. Not that I know what you‚Äôre really thinking half the time, you keep a lot to yourself. You‚Äôre an incredible human being, so I hope you understand it‚Äôs okay to let those emotions out. You‚Äôre too good to bottle everything up all the time. 

No wonder I woke up this morning with a fast beating heart. I‚Äôm in love with a literal angel, not sure why you fell to earth, but I‚Äôm glad you did. You‚Äôre radiant as anything that‚Äôs graced existence. 

Every waking moment feels like an eternal dream. Life has been cruel, harsh, unfair. Not just for me, or you, but for everyone. That‚Äôs how it is. But when you‚Äôre around, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm floating, a dream like state of mind. But you know how easily you make me feel this way, don‚Äôt you? 

I love you. ",2,1740686065.0,letters,1,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

i'm 26 years old and i've been on a boundary-setting journey for the first time in my life, these past few months. it drove some people out of my life, so i feel very alone right now. it also released a lot of energy, though. 

my mom lives in another country, but i still technically live ""with parents"" - i live in her apartment with dad, who technically should live with her but there is documentation problems for moving. so first i lived at parents' because i was sick for several years out of school, then the pandemic, and since then i'm helping my dad with dementia, taking care of him. i also have ADHD so that's not fucking helping. 

the money also was always shared because mom and i built a joint business together, i handled all the online stuff and it is actually a big contribution. so i never felt too bad about having ""shared"" money (i mostly only spend on food, doctors, and coffee here and there, tbh). 

every time i tried to invest time into my own career, she put me down by saying it's not gonna bring as much money as our business, so i should get my priorities straight right now. for the last year i've been working though, i don't earn a lot, but it is something. i still help her and take care of dad. 

recently i've been hanging up when she would start yelling, or calling out her manipulations, things like that. our business is in a tight spot financially, i spend all i earn on both me and dad. but she started to ignore my messages about money for both me AND dad (food) and my meds until the last moment, to idk, teach me smth or do a powerplay of sorts. and recently she's been talking about a trip she wants to take soon (it is an important one for business, but it's costly) - and i was like, hey, can't we pay at least 200 dollars for the apartment bills debt? (it's huge and they're legit gonna turn the heating/electricity off in a month). she tried to trail off to prioritize other things, i said are you serious, and she blamed me for all sorts of vile stuff and lashed out. 

when we talked about it again, she said ""HOW OLD ARE YOU?"". i clarified whether she means i should be the one to pay it. she was like OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LIVES THERE, you got an apartment gifted to you. (mind you, this debt has been growing since i was TWELVE because she just didnt fucking care - and it wasn't gifted to me, im stuck here with my dad). 

so now im realizing for the first time that all my guilt, all my ""im always wrong and cant do shit right"", is actually not true. and that her words about ""family is the only one who will help you"" is not about loyalty, it is about keeping me away from other people and also her care/help only lasts as long as i am 100% obedient and have no sense of self. 

i am really lost and cant tell my up from down. she uses those omnipotent techniques to hint that i am ruining my life by letting myself talk this way to my mother (as in, there will be Punishment), and said my husband left me because he heard us fighting once (he's literally a terrible bipolar liar and always has been, borderline fucking tricking me into marriage).

anyway. to be clear, if it sounds like ""everyone around me is bad"", i've never blamed anyone else besides myself in my fucking life. but maybe it's about time to start.",4,1740685603.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

1izojp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Worldpackers/comments/1izojp6/am_i_wrong_for_writing_a_bad_review_for_my/,Am I wrong for writing a bad review for my volunteering experience?,"***Apologies, this is also partially a vent

I'm wondering how to write my review as it's conflicting. Do I share my experience and try warn people or just leave it and move on to try not ruin other peoples possible experiences here which may not be the same as mine.

Basically, I'm two months into volunteering at a place where I feel micromanaged, and a lot of things just don't sit right. I‚Äôm thinking of leaving a bad review but want to know if I‚Äôm being unreasonable. 

This is my dilemma, overall it's great. Fantastic. Great other volunteers, the place is fucking stunning (jungle, old cool trees, river) the builder guy on site is great. Great facilities, cute town nearby. it's just the owner man. 

Here are the main things that bother me:

Animals, cats, dogs, are kept in 2x3 metre cages with no chance to roam, and in my two months, the only time I saw one of the dogs out was when it escaped. I understand I'm in Malaysia and the Muslim view on dogs but he's Christian!! - like give them up to adoption or free them??? Anything is better than sitting in a cage for goodness knows how long. Also he has like 7 bearded dragons in a box wayyy too small. His choice but still it's just cruel. 

The place has like 7 methed up drug users coming and going freely (all night and day), Two of them work here, the ones that don't sneak in eat the food (some which we bought) when storage is unlocked. The owner insists on keeping these lights on all night for safety (which makes it difficult to sleep) yet allows this jaw gyrating people to come in and out. Even the builder insisted on the key so he lock for his tools at night because he didn't trust them. They ask him for cigarettes every day and once asked me for money. Just kinda sketchy. 

The owner preaches Dr. Barbara O'Neill‚Äôs pseudoscientific practices, like recommending onions on your feet for 'detox,' and preaches these to volunteers. She's banned from her home country and a lot of it has no scientific evidence. 

Food choices have to align with his personal beliefs ‚Äî for instance, he refused to provide coffee due to Barbara's beliefs but instead bought a lot of processed sugary shit. Even though he's not the one eating any of the food or drinking any of the drink. He's a healthy man, buys veggies for us, advocates for health (more on that later) also buys processed sugary garbage we don't ask for but draws the line at coffee?

He imposes weird shit like making me fold my mattress, telling me off for not turning off my fan when I went for 3 mins to fill up my water bottle - while he left his on for a day or two while he left (I turned it off for him), he told me wash my ALREADY soapy hands again before I put on a kettle, telling me to do 'this' and 'that' during construction right before the trained builder on site shouted ""No no no"" after I did it (this has happened way too much). Honestly too much stuff to mention about him being a control freak. 

Another deliemma is we are actually fed. I feel I may be being a bitch about this one!!! (I may be being a bitch about the whole thing but the other volunteers agree). Food is available, runs out fast and sometimes we are down to rice, cabbage and ramen packets. This can keep us going but it's completely to his liking. As in we had to ask specifically for meat, then actual meat as he bought processed chicken slabs. Then enough actual meat and food to last us while he's gone 4 days a week (there's 6 men here doing physical labour) - which hasn't happened after 2 months. I get I could go out and buy food but you know buy enough. It's part of the deal. Again I'm probably being a bitch. 

I feel like I am being controlled more than actually volunteering, with little room for personal autonomy. Is this enough reason to leave a negative review? I could go with 3 stars as I have actually had a good experience overall. But I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not overreacting about the owner. Because he's a 0.3 star but when he's not around it's lovely. I'm thinking I write honest and try ""warn"" people? If you guys think my views are justified. Would love some feedback thank you. 

***Edit Also should I worry about my review in return? I have verbally pushed back to some of his micromanaging and questioned it. but normally he replies with the similar energy to ""just because"". But, I do the things he micromanages me to do even after I question it. I feel he's a control freak and may not like this but I feel he might be like this all the time where he gets pissed off at things not done his way. I hope he doesn't have a grudge against people that question his ways. I haven't even brought up the problems with the pseudoscience (yet)",2,1740685416.0,Worldpackers,4,1.0,False

Dear agent,¬†

I saw on your MSWL that you‚Äôre looking for \_\_\_, I hope you‚Äôll consider my cozy mystery novel THE SECRET LIFE OF A PET DETECTIVE complete at 70,000 words. It combines the whip-smart amateur detective from J.C. Kenney¬†*Elmo Simpsons‚Äô Mystery series*¬†and the pet-shelter setting of T.C. LoTempio¬†*Cat Rescue Mystery*¬†series.¬†It features #ownvoice Asian American experience with a multicultural cast.¬†

With a pet-pageant around the corner, the picture-purr-fect East Valley is aquiver with excitement. For twenty-three-year-old Clark Zhang, it‚Äôs another miserable day in his miserable life. After failing Cornell vet school, he‚Äôs back in his hometown working at the family pet shelter, dreaming of pouncing back to vet school. That is until he finds out their landlord, Mr. Baxter, is about to seize the place because of financial troubles ‚Äìmostly because of his (failed) ivy education.

Stewing in guilt, Clark sets to negotiate with the landlord‚Äôs wife, head of the local Humane Society, to throw the ulti-mutt fundraise; introducing rescue pets in the dog show. Instead, he finds himself and his old high school crush performing CPR on Mrs. Baxter. To top it all off, the average-sized poodle Jeremiah, heir to his mistress‚Äôs fortune, is missing and his high school buddy turned cop is hounding him.¬†

Luckily, John Baxter, the victim‚Äôs son, knows too much. Clark has until the pageant to make him collaborate if he wants to save the family business, get the girl, and clear his name. Otherwise, Mr. Baxter might put his strip mall plan into action. That is if the killer doesn‚Äôt catch him for pawing too close at the truth.¬†

Thank you for considering my submission,

  
From the clean front window of the East Valley's Pet Shelter, the world was a pale shade of indigo. The hints of red in the east behind the sprawling mansions announced the beginning of another scorching day. For Clark Zhang, this was the start of another mediocre day, in his mediocre hometown, in his mediocre life as a pet shelter attendant.¬†

The young man took a long sip of coffee from his Cornell University mug, barely tasting the bitter aroma, and hunched his shoulders over his horseshoe desk. The glow of his computer highlighted the dark circles under his almond-shaped eyes. Missing pet emails from anxious pet owners flooded the shelter‚Äôs inbox. Dog theft wasn‚Äôt usually a problem in East Valley, where pure breads and the occasional F1 pup were the norm. But with the dog show coming up, the young man knew this was only the beginning.

Clark replied with the shelter‚Äôs form, reminding people to make an appointment if the pet hadn‚Äôt been found in the next twenty-four hours following the disappearance. This usually reduced the number of cases by half.¬†

The bell above the door jingled and Lindsay Taylor, Sweet Whisker Bakery‚Äôs manager, walked in. Her crystal-clear voice instantly broke the monotony of his day. ‚ÄúGood morning, everyone!‚Äù¬†She dropped five boxes‚Äìone small stacked on top of four larger boxes- in front of Clark¬†and wiped beads of sweat on her forehead.

Clark‚Äôs heart skipped a beat and heat crept up her cheeks. ‚ÄúH‚Äîhi,‚Äù he managed.¬†For a moment, the young man forgot everything about his job and the pet theft situation. He smiled at his old high school crush. She also happened to be the nicest, most reliable volunteer the town had to offer combined with a fellow pet lover.¬†",1,1740684846.0,CozyMystery,1,1.0,False

Some stuff I say below I won't explain in the post because it would be too long and it's not directly linked to Lauren, I'll mark them with \* - feel free to ask me to explain in the comments.

Before anyone asks: yes Heat 2 exists, it is a book and both a prequel and a sequel. 

Spoilers for Heat & Heat 2.

# 1. Lauren to Vincent

In Lauren‚Äôs first scene:

* Vincent only comes out of the dressing room/bathroom (the room that has a *mirror* that he was looking at) when Lauren arrives. When she leaves, he goes back briefly in the dressing room and immediately leaves the scene entirely.
* The only character he actually looks at intently in the scene is Lauren. He only ever briefly glances at Justine.
* The only moment in the scene when he is still is when he is looking at Lauren.
* Justine tries to have a conversation with him, but he ignores her question and instead goes to talk to and look at Lauren.
* His only smile in the scene is directed at Lauren.
* He‚Äôs ‚Äúout of time‚Äù for Justine but has the time to stare at Lauren.
* He didn‚Äôt know what she had planned for the day.

When Vincent comes home late at night:

* Vincent‚Äôs only questions are about Lauren. He does not ask about Justine‚Äôs day.
* His first actual contribution to the conversation with Justine is a question about Lauren.
* When Justine tries to steer the conversation back to them, Vincent ignores that and asks again about Lauren. It‚Äôs so weird that even Justine makes a weird face about it, as in ‚Äúhow dare you be so concerned about my kid when you so don‚Äôt care about me?‚Äù
* As soon as the conversation effectively goes back to Justine and Vincent, he‚Äôs pissed.

When Lauren is outside:

* Vincent is out with Bosko, so he‚Äôs at work, yet he does not hesitate one second to (have Bosko) pull over and bring Lauren home.

When he comes home to Justine and Ralph:

* His very first question is to ask where Lauren is.

In the hotel room scene:

* Vincent is the most frantic he‚Äôs ever been in the entire movie.
* Vincent calls her ‚Äúbaby‚Äù (a lot), when it was always ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù before, twice. Justine was ‚Äúbaby‚Äù.

He clearly cares more about Lauren than about Justine/his relationship with Justine. Somewhat logical since Lauren is linked to Neil in many ways. It goes as far as this: in her first scene, Lauren wears a shirt that has the exact same colors and pattern as the lights behind Neil in the coffee shop scene. It means that in arguably the most important scene of the movie, Vincent‚Äôs view is: foreground, Neil, background, Lauren. Foreground, professional sphere, background, personal sphere; it is undeniable he cares first and foremost about Neil, however it‚Äôs interesting that the representation for the personal sphere is Lauren, not Justine. He cares more about Lauren than about Justine, so much more he picks Lauren before work (when she is outside on the bench) which he never does for Justine. Then, when Lauren is in the hospital, he picks Neil. So the hierarchy is Neil > Lauren > Work > Justine. (In Heat 2, he thinks about Justine once. He thinks about Lauren and calls her, twice. He thinks about Neil a lot. The hierarchy holds.) Despite the fact that she matters a lot to him, he's still not very involved. Doesn't know her day to day, doesn't seem to go see her at the end of the first day, etc.

# 2. Vincent to Lauren

In her first scene:

* The first thing she does is to greet Vincent (before asking about the barrettes which is very important to her).
* She greets Vincent but not her mother (maybe she‚Äôs seen her already?)
* Her only smile/excited behavior (in the whole movie) is from a question Vincent asks and is directed at him, although arguably the smile is really about her bio father.

Lauren in the house:

* She has an art project stuck on the kitchen wall of a black suit with no man inside.

When Lauren is outside:

* She wants to be alone but visibly perks up when she spots Vincent‚Äôs car and runs to him and gives him a kiss (the most affection we see her display for anyone in the movie).
* She seems to know Mike (Bosko). She knows Vincent‚Äôs coworkers. ?

In the hotel room:

* She presumably broke into Vincent‚Äôs room and tried to kill herself there, and not at home.
* Later in the hospital Justine says ‚Äúshe chose you \[versus her bio dad\]‚Äù.

The art project is telling too: she knows Vincent‚Äôs work, his coworkers, his outside persona, but not the man inside. He is all work, he doesn‚Äôt actually exist as a man. She knows what he does but not who he is. Still, she loves him.

# 3. Lauren to Justine (and vice versa)

* Justine ignores Lauren in favor of Vincent in their first scene.
* Lauren is visibly disappointed in her and leaves.
* Justine half-assedly answers Lauren in their second scene while staring at her newspaper. She ends up listening to her when Lauren takes her newspaper away.
* Lauren stays in her room all day when her bio dad doesn‚Äôt show up. Meaning, she isolated herself. Did she keep even Justine outside?
* Lauren commits suicide in Vincent‚Äôs hotel room and not in her mother‚Äôs house (also her own house).

# 1-2-3 Conclusion

* Her only smile/excitement in the entire movie is for the father figure: it‚Äôs about the bio dad and it‚Äôs directed at Vincent.
* Even when she wants to be alone, she runs to Vincent when she sees him.
* She is so devastated by Vincent leaving the family home she follows him into his motel room.
* The trigger for her suicide is Vincent leaving, not her father not showing up.
* In both her scenes with her mother, she feels unheard and neglected, and is disappointed in her mother.

All in all, she is neglected by all 3 of her parental figures. The father is never there, Vincent cares but is half-there, Justine is there but Lauren still feels unheard by her.

# 4. The players (and those who don‚Äôt play)

The players are those who accept the rules of the game and start playing. The criminals, first: easy money, against the risk of death or prison. The cops: the power of brutality, manhunting and law enforcement, against the risk of having to participate in WWIII on any given day and/or to be killed on the job. Their partners/wives: they all accept the rules, they all start playing when they choose to get involved with a player.

In Heat, the only two characters who are *not* players are Lauren and Lilian. Eady was not for most of the movie but she ends up becoming a player when she chooses to stay with Neil after learning his true nature. Justine was always a player since she married a cop.

Lauren, however, did not choose to have a cop as a step-father. Lilian chose an ex-con trying to go straight as a partner, so not a player; he became one again unbeknown to her.

(To note: the name Lilian means ‚Äúpurity‚Äù. It comes from the lily flower, itself meaning purity, innocence, peace, rebirth. Rebirth like her partner going straight; purity and innocence and peace like her not being a player (and her partner was not supposed to be one either). This name was initially Justine‚Äôs name (in LA Takedown). It is clear why it couldn‚Äôt actually be her name (and so why it was given to Lilian instead): because by virtue of marrying a player, Justine is not innocent.)

Out of the only two non-players, Vincent only knows Lauren. He might get to know Lilian during his investigation post-movie, but he might consider her a player simply because she got with an ex-con (which is a high risk situation in terms of the game). Therefore, to him, the only real non-player is Lauren: to him, she is an innocent, caught in the crossfire of the game; a pure collateral victim of the players in her life, and that player is VINCENT: he‚Äôs the reason Justine turned into a player, although she chose that; he is the reason Lauren is in the game‚Äôs crossfire.

# 5. Lauren and the dead girls

Lauren and the teenage prostitute Waingro kills are the only 2 teenage girls in the movie. They are both related to Vincent. It is said that this teenage girl makes it a series, meaning she‚Äôs Waingro's third kill. Vincent also has to have other cases and other victims. While the prostitutes are players too (though not with the same status as a cop?), there must be total non-players among those victims/dead teenage girls. They all get investigated by Vincent, and so join his banquet table to haunt him in his sleep. And in Heat 2, both times he calls Lauren, it‚Äôs immediately after thinking about a dead girl he‚Äôs investigating. Thinking about his victims makes him think about Lauren. The two are linked.

Lauren, if she is 13 like Natalie Portman during the movie‚Äôs shooting, was born in 1982. In Heat 2, Sofia was already dead by ‚Äò88 and Vincent already has some distance from it, so she must have died in ‚Äò86 or before. Before her death, she had three miscarriages. Therefore, Vincent‚Äôs unborn children would be approximately Lauren‚Äôs age, had they lived. Looking at Lauren must remind him of that; his dead kids, and by extension, Sofia‚Äôs death and his part in it, meaning his mistakes.

Therefore, for Vincent, Lauren is related to all the dead girls: the victims he investigates (professional sphere) and his unborn children (personal sphere).¬†

He feels guilt about the unborn children (he feels guilty about Sofia‚Äôs death, of which the miscarriages were a factor), he feels guilt about the victims he investigates (they haunt his dreams, he‚Äôs supposed to protect them, he feels empathy for the family, he takes the angst in‚Ä¶), he feels guilt because he‚Äôs exposing Lauren to the game/his neglect: Lauren is the culmination. He must feel all of that at once when looking at her. She‚Äôs the sum total of everything he fucked up in life while being an innocent teenage girl who still loves him.

# 6. Lauren as a reflection of Vincent

* Her name: Lauren comes from laurel, the laurels of victory (Vincent). She is etymologically very closely related to him.
* She grows to want to be outside the home, alone, more than being with her friends or mother. Vincent clearly likes being alone and outside more than being with his wife: the city is his playground, not the home.
* She cares a lot about her own appearance, fidgeting about her barrettes at the same time as Vincent is fidgeting about his tie.
* She somehow figures out how to track down people (manhunting), since she finds Vincent and his hotel room in not even a day, much like Vincent is a manhunter.
* She has a death drive, much like Vincent, who is obsessed with death (who in Heat 2 drives at night with his headlights off just to see what happens).
* She dies in water, in his space, since Death!Vincent is the one navigating the Styx and taking souls to the other side.\*

# 7. Lauren as a reflection of Neil

* Both her last name and Neil‚Äôs last name mean ‚Äúson of‚Ä¶‚Äù: they are both defined by their relationship with their father.
* Her father neglected her and abandoned him in her young teenagehood (13 and before). In Heat 2, Neil‚Äôs father neglects him and abandons him in his young teenagehood (before 11).
* She wears a shirt with the colors and patterns of the lights behind Neil in the coffee shop.
* Outside, she is separated from nature by a chain-link fence. Neil, outside Kelso‚Äôs home, is separated from trees by a chain-link fence. This style of fence is also reminiscent of prison: they are both loners who want out.
* She has abandonment issues (from her father), him too (from his parents and Elisa (from Heat 2)), which show in their joint credo to leave people first in order not to be left: Neil with his 30 second rule, Lauren with her suicide attempt.
* She half breaks into/half sweet-talks (?) her way into a hotel room, by herself, much like Neil does. They both do it with death on their mind (and both break into the room of the same person: (evil!)Vincent\*).

# 8. The baptism

A baptism is:

* A declaration/show of faith by the baptised
* The death of the previous life of the baptised
* A purification of the sins of the baptised
* The rebirth of the baptised as a child of God

Lauren‚Äôs suicide attempt is:

* Her choosing Vincent as a father as she chose to die in his space
* Her death and end of her life
* Her being freed from her sins (lack of self-worth = fixed by death, having a bad father = fixed by choosing a new father)
* Her rebirth as Vincent saves her/accepts her as his.

Vincent accepts her as his daughter by calling her ‚Äúbaby‚Äù. It‚Äôs a parallel to the mother of the dead prostitute, who calls her child her baby, AND Justine who, in the hospital, calls her child her baby. (Another parallel between the teenage prostitute and Lauren.) Vincent calling Lauren ‚Äúbaby‚Äù is akin to him claiming her as a daughter and not a step-daughter; it‚Äôs a promotion. (It is *also* Vincent replacing Justine with Lauren, or, maybe, his frantic state showing the truth: that his number 1 relationship in the movie is with Lauren, not Justine. This holds into Heat 2.)¬†

God opened the clouds and talked to Jesus, claiming him, right after his baptism. Similarly, Vincent reaches out to Lauren and claims her right after her baptism.

As Vincent is (the God of) Death\*, Lauren is thus becoming the child of God.

As Vincent is Death\*, the show of faith he needed was not just immersion in water, but death in water, to show that she is unafraid of death, that she welcomes it.

She then becomes pure from the sin of being her biological father‚Äôs daughter, thanks to becoming the daughter of a father who is emotionally open to her. 

# 9. Lauren & Vincent

Lauren is clearly neglected by Vincent - he may care about her, but he is still absent. He asks *Justine* how she is, not Lauren.¬†Meanwhile, Lauren obviously reminds Vincent of his dead victims, and of his dead family.

Despite all of this, these two characters never fight, never hold anything against the other. Despite this, when Lauren‚Äôs outside, they meet in the wild, in the jungle, and despite Vincent being at work, despite Lauren wanting to be alone, they both go towards each other.¬†Despite this, Lauren still chooses him over her biological father, and Vincent claims her back.¬†Despite this, Lauren kills herself in his motel bathtub, because she is so afraid of his rejection she‚Äôs ready to leave first. She wants him to death.

Vincent is attracted to her because she is the only ‚Äúpure‚Äù thing in his life; the only innocent, the only non-player, the only one who did not do anything wrong. She is the epitome of the blameless victim, the people he has sworn to protect.

She is his victims, the dead people that haunt his sleep, that follow him everywhere, the subjects of his kingdom; she is them following him even in waking life. She is his past (his dead children), his present, and his future (a future possible victim).

He is so attached to his work, so incapable to see anything but his work, to interact with the world through any lens but his work lens, that the person he responds to the most in his personal life is Lauren, the person who reminds him of his dead girls.

Lauren attracts him because she is a reflection of himself (in his first scene with her, she‚Äôs the only thing that pulls him from the mirror; when he‚Äôs home at night, he looks at his reflection on the TV; he spends the movie running after his twin, Neil; Justine and Sofia both look like him) ...as much as she attracts him because she is a reflection of Neil.

He is attracted to her because she is what he knows: an innocent young girl, getting fucked over by the world. As he told Justine: ‚ÄúI told you when we hooked up baby, that you were gonna have to share me with all the bad people and all the ugly events on the planet.‚Äù Bad people and ugly events stick together: him and Lauren.

He is blocked off to Justine: he knows he causes her pain, intellectually, but emotionally he‚Äôs blocked off and doesn‚Äôt take in, has no empathy. ‚ÄúWith Sofia I didn‚Äôt take anything in.‚Äù (Heat 2)

To Lauren, he is open. He takes in her emotions and understands them, he has empathy. Lauren reacts to that, so even though Vincent is only half-there, when he is, she feels heard and seen. With her mother, she feels unheard.

He takes it in with Lauren because he takes it in with his victims. It keeps him sharp, and by association, it happens also with Lauren, pure and akin to his victims. He only reacts to the part of his personal life that reminds him of work.

Because Vincent sees her, she picks him, the adult who seems to care the most. But maybe she feels the only thing he actually responds to is death. Maybe she wanted him so badly she got infected by his illness, death and the death drive.

Either way, at the end of the movie, the only things he has actually responded to, emotionally, are Lauren‚Äôs death, held in his arms as she was baptized by death-waters as his daughter, and Neil‚Äôs death, as he held the hand of his twin and took in his last heartbeats.¬†

Maybe at the beginning of the movie he shared himself between his work and Justine (them happily rolling around in bed), but at the end, he only shows commitment to the bad people (Neil) and the ugly events (Lauren). Again, Neil > Lauren > work > Justine.

At the end of the movie, Vincent has been completely overtaken by Death. His professional life: was already all about death and victims and corpses. His dreams: inhabited by dead people. His personal life: Lauren, infected by him, committed suicide and as such has joined the ranks of the innocent victims. Neil, his twin, is dead, and Vincent basically is as well; there is nothing left in his life that is untouched by death. (This holds into Heat 2, as he doesn‚Äôt try to have another romantic relationship. He only has work and some contacts with Lauren.)

  
A 10th possible part is Lauren and the weird incestuous vibes with Vincent, but I don't know if there is really something to say about it since most of it was in a deleted scene which was, well, deleted.",3,1740684732.0,movies,2,0.8,False

First dates are not hard, especially when you've been around the block once or twice, really just showing up and being normal gets you farther than most people.

#Representative profile

This is the most important thing, your profile is the only piece of information they have about you. Not only do you need a representative profile in terms of how you look (aka no catfishing) but you also need one that represents who you are as a person? Are you an extroverted concert goer? Then yeah focus on that in your profile, but if you're not really into music don't mention it just because that's what you hear women want. Basically you are trying to find the best way to show yourself in a way that is true to who you are as a person.

#Comfortable setting

This takes a little bit of trial and error, but you need to find the type of date where you thrive and you show the best of your personality. I've learnt over the years that I absolutely suck and coffee and walk in the park dates. I'm just awkward when walking along the sidewalk/park and can never really get the conversation going as I'm so focused on where we should walk next and the time of day isn't the best for me. On the other hand I've found that I'm great at post-work drink dates is when my energy is the highest and being grounded at a bar is where I'm able to shine. For others it may be an activity like mini-golf where your competition can show. Everyone is going to be different, but try to find a setting that makes you feel confident and comfortable, so you can shine.

#Study their profile

You really don't know much about the person, but between photos, prompts and fillable answers you can get a good sense of their personality and what they are looking for. They talk about movies in their profile? Prepare some questions about movies and/or responses to those questions. They talk about wanting to find the best restaurant in town? Go down that path. Their profile is a goldmine of potential conversation topics

#Prepare some stories

I have about 4 stories that I know really well and have practiced orating them so I don't stumble over my words and can talk confidently about them. Most dates 2-3 stories come up naturally in the course of conversation and then they'll turn into full blown conversations with all the potential tangents.

#Don't worry about physical touch

If you got this date via a dating app there is an implication that you find each other physically attractive. You matched, you put effort into talking, effort into meeting up, you wouldn't do that if you didn't find them attractive and vice versa. Trying to invade space and force the physical touch because you've been told to do that to make her like you will just come off unnatural. Just stick to a pattern, hug hello as you meet and go on the date in a normal way. If there's a natural point where it makes sense to engage that way sure, go for it, but don't force it.

#Kiss at the end

Pretty much always kiss at the end of the date. If you're feeling less confident about how its going ask to kiss her goodnight. If she says no, you're probably not getting a 2nd date yet, but I haven't had a single person say no yet. Bonus tip: if you're taking public transportation home, ask her right outside the bar and not at the bus/subway stop. There is two main reasons; 1. Lots of people around the bus stop which makes it a lot more awkward to make out on the street, 2. There might be a mad chase for the bus which can ruin your ""goodbye""


As a whole, first dates are all about putting yourself in a position where you feel confident and your personality can shine, what works best for you will be different than what works for me. Figure out how to make yourself feel the best",1,1740684633.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1izo8i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1izo8i3/first_time_getting_sw_coffee/,First time getting S&W coffee,"Recently, on the advice of the sub, I made my first purchase from S&W roasters. I got two bags:

1izo7ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/1izo7ny/shielding_power_line_communication_how_to/,[Shielding: Power Line Communication] How to mitigate inaudible sound and low frequency sound pulsing.,"Power Line Communication (PLC) pulses inaudible sound and audible sound through wall outlets, ceiling light fixtures and house wiring.

[WIKI] Electronic Torture: Power Line Communication

https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedEnergyWeapons/comments/17wtg13/wiki_electronic_torture_power_line_communication/

To ascertain whether the pulsing is by PLC, or the hum or pulsing by radiofrequency, submit sound meter reports. See the Meter Apps: Sound wikis and the Meter Reports: Sound wikis.

Differentiate between the hum and PLC. The hum is produced by ionospheric heaters such as HAARP. The hum is throughout the home and yard. Evidenced by taking measurements in rooms you are not in and the yard that you are not in. Yet, the hum is louder and more vibrational when the electric water heater is on. See the hum wikis.

Disconnect your car battery upon returning home. The military remotely accesses bluetooth in cars to turn the satellite radio on. Concealed emitter in cars boosts TI's and neighbors' wifi.

PLC produces inaudible sound pulsing that is pin point. PLC attacks left ear drum, BROCA'S area of the left side of the brain and the corner of the left eye. PLC can attack other parts of the body.

Ear muffs with EVA foam slightly mitigate pulsing PLC. Criva basalt and water head crate mitigate PLC pulsing from sides, top and rear but not from below. Read those posts.

Before going to sleep, throughout your home, not just in your bedroom:

(1) Unplug USB wall chargers, refrigerator, washer, floor lamps, table lamps, space heaters, blenders, crock pots, coffee makers, etc. Connect washer to an extension cord to make it easier to unplug and plug back in. Remove night lights permanently.

(2) Turn off ceiling light switches. Unplug garage door openers. Even when circuit breakers are off, a light switch that is on in one room can pulse sound to another room.

Turn off the main breaker on the electric pole. It will turn off the service drop line and electric panel. If you don't have a main breaker, install it.

Turn off all circuit breakers in electric panel. Food stays cold in refrigerator over night. Food remains frozen for over a day. 120 volt circuit breakers pulse more than 220 volt circuit breakers.

Turn off the main breaker in electric panel.

If you cannot do the above, test by camping off grid at least a mile from power lines. Do you have vibrations off grid?

People living in multi story dwellings will not be able to mitigate. Neighbors' house wiring below and above them could vibrate. TIs will need to relocate to a single story home preferably off grid.

After awakening, turn on the two main breakers. Turn on just the circuit breakers you are using. Turn them off after using them. Plug whatever you are using. Unplug after use. Reduce electricity use.

Turn on circuit breaker to water heater every other day to take a shower, wash laundry and wash dishes in hot water. Turn off immediately afterwards. Or install a gas water heater without an electric ignition.

Outlets plus. Power density of pulsing of ceiling light fixtures is less than floor lamps and table lamps plugged into outlets. Keep them unplugged. Use ceiling light fixtures and incandescent light bulbs instead. Yet, military pulses ceiling light fixtures. Therefore, install sky lights. Or reside in a greenhouse or sun room with no house wiring. Or use candles and LED warm lanterns. Cease using exterior porch light. Instead install solar motion sensors. If a night owl, become a morning person to decrease the number of hours at night using light before bedtime.",1,1740684555.0,TargetedIndividuals,0,1.0,False

1izo5kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1izo5kq/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_parents_after_i_told/,"AITAH for cutting off my parents after I told them about my pregnancy in ""the wrong way"".","Basically what it says above.

I found out I was pregnant and it was a situation that wasn't planned, I wasn't happy about it, I had been with the father for about 4 months and I didn't entirely trust him (I ended up having an abortion and finding out he was a deadbeat with his existing child so I made the right choice).

When I first found out, I texted my mum in a panic, her first words to me ""I don't think you need this in your life right now"".  I'm 40 years old.  I've never been pregnant before.  It wasn't a cardigan that I could take back for a refund, it was a pregnancy.   She's also always been quite judgemental and tone deaf, but I thought that she was bound to show support in this situation.  But no.

I responded with hostility and said I just wanted some support from my mother, she acted like she WAS being supportive but I felt the damage was done, and I told her to just leave me alone.

I felt really terrible about the situation and I wrote her a long email.  I explained everything in the email about how her response hurt me and how I was really scared and worried.  I told her the circumstances in full, that it was a complete accident/I couldn't believe this had happened to me etc etc.

Her response was 3 lines, ""yeah i'm sure it'll be fine, but your father and I are very disappointed you chose to let us know via text and not call us or come and see us"".

I was beyond upset.  I didn't WANT to deal with their reactions in real time, at the time I told them I just wanted some support and to gauge the reactions.  Growing up my dad was basically abusive and alcoholic and my mum is quite a judgemental person, nothing is ever her fault.  I love them both beyond belief, but growing up in a household full of drama has affected my life a lot and my sisters.

We've both got careers, cars, houses, never had their help (not that we think we're owed) but it's always us who has to visit them, and for my 40th birthday my mum sent me some money in a card via my sister.  She couldn't even be bothered to show up and visit.  They live 10 minutes away and my mum drops the occasional bit of post round if it is still addressed to their house.  

For their birthdays/christmas I take them out for coffee/lunch/afternoon tea and really push the boat out because I love them both and want a positive relatoinship with them.   When I bought my first house it took my dad literally months to visit and that was only at my request and because it was my birthday.

My mum keeps needling my sister for updates on the situation.  She doesn't know I've had an abortion.  My sister has told her how I feel and she just makes out I was ""looking for a fight"" and she hasn't done anything wrong.  My aunt treats her like shit and she puts up with it, visits her and makes the effort, but for me? Her pregnant daughter, I can just get stuffed.

I pay for their internet connection and have done for literally years now, i've bought them phones/tablets and computers on top of the trips out and the weekly visits.   They have never taken an ounce of accountability for the past, but both me and my sister see little point in dwelling on it - we got therapy and dealt with it as adults.

After this though, I just think you know what? My parents are toxic.  This issue has been too big to ignore.  I feel like a boundary has been crossed, I refuse to contact them first and this is the most hurtful thing they have ever done to me.  I haven't had a single text, a single apology and mum just keeps wanting updates from my sister for everything.

I am extremely upset about the whole thing and considering cutting them off permanently and it makes me cry because they are both in their late 70s and won't be around forever.  AITAH?",2,1740684424.0,AITAH,8,0.75,False

I'm loving the game so far.  I like that it shows you how to do the art because I had NOCLUE how to do it haha.   The story so far has been fun.  I will say the responsiveness with apple pencil when drawing the art is a bit wonky at times, but that might just be a me error than a game error.  

Here is the Hot take.   ENERGY.  Is it fun to be time gated no?  I personally find it nice, because i can take a small break to go do something else like eat, get some water, stretch.

For context, my cat of 11 years, Coffee passed away 7.5 months ago. He passed peacefully in his sleep. It was extremely unexpected, and he passed away due to hyperthropic cardiomyophaty.

After grieving for 2 months, I stopped crying, looked at our photos together and smiled, and decided to open the doors of my heart and adopt another cat whom I love with all my heart, and is sitting next to me right now. 

However, yesterday while looking through my photos, I stumbled upon a very old photo of me and coffee, from around when I was 10, and immediately broke down crying. 

I want to know if you guys believe cats go to a nice place when they pass, and if he's happy right now, maybe playing with other kitties. I hope he misses me as much as I miss him, and still remembers me and knows that I still love him and will always continue to love him with my heart. Wherever he is, I hope he is extremely happy, running around in fields full of green grass and flowers, messing around with other cats and having the time of his life. It just makes me so sad knowing I will never see him again in this world. 

We grew up together and he was always my best friend growing up. I was just a little kid when I had got him, and knowing he passed in his sleep devastates me. It is peaceful, but I wish I had noticed it and held him in my arms as he passed. I hope he is not mad at me for not knowing to be there with him while he passed, and still remembers me and loves me. I'll always love him ‚ù§Ô∏è My little gentleman.

Grief really is a weird thing. You think it's gone, but it hits you like a truck on a random wednesday afternoon, and you find yourself, once again, bawling your eyes out.

Thank you everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è

Lots of posts lately about the price of coffee. Highly recommend trying here, they have two locations:

- One in town next to the Post Office
- Another location next under Travel Lodge, Dublin Road

I‚Äôm new to the no-buy community and have been following low-buy since the beginning of the year. I‚Äôm having a problem with buying coffee at work. I work a high stress job which includes night shift. Since starting low-buy I‚Äôve been a lot more prepared for work with meal prepping, including making more freezer/pantry friendly meals to reduce waste. That being said, coffee remains a big challenge for me. I find it is both a physical and psychological pick me up and I end up buying a latte more days than not. I also have realized since joining this sub that I participate in ‚Äúlittle treat‚Äù culture and I find that really hard to let go of. 

I think starting by substituting the behaviour with something less costly/wasteful would be a good approach. However, I have a sensitive stomach so anything really acidic won‚Äôt really work- that is also why I specifically buy lattes, which are really expensive!

Just wondering if others have suggestions for both my specific problem or with stopping participation in treat culture. Thanks! ",8,1740683867.0,nobuy,14,1.0,False

1iznvvo,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjev9kzxeqqo,Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions,"Oh, Afghanistan. ⁄ö⁄©ŸÑ€å Ÿá€åŸàÿßÿØ Tim Hortons Kandahar a lovely, coffee scented memory perhaps for some. 

Summary:
The Taliban have implemented an extensive surveillance network in Kabul, deploying 90,000 CCTV cameras to monitor the city's six million residents. The system includes facial recognition capabilities and the ability to track individuals at long distances. Officially, the Taliban claim the network is intended to reduce crime, citing a 30% drop in crime rates, though these figures are unverified. However, the system raises concerns about privacy violations, repression of dissent, and the enforcement of Taliban morality laws, particularly against women.

Key Developments:

Technological Expansion: The Taliban's surveillance infrastructure has grown significantly since their takeover in 2021, from 850 cameras under the previous government to 90,000 today.

Facial Recognition and Tracking: The system categorizes individuals by age, gender, and facial features, with high-resolution zoom capabilities.

Control and Enforcement: Authorities claim the system is used solely by city police, but concerns persist over its potential use for monitoring women's dress and suppressing opposition.

Public Burden: Some residents have been pressured to contribute financially to the camera installations, with reports of threats of utility cuts for non-payment.

Human Rights Implications: Rights groups warn that the lack of data protection laws makes the system vulnerable to abuse, exacerbating the Taliban's broader restrictions on freedoms, particularly for women.


Strategic Implications:

1. Internal Control: The surveillance system enhances the Taliban's ability to suppress dissent, monitor political opponents, and enforce strict social policies.


2. Chinese Involvement: The cameras appear to be sourced from Chinese company Dahua, suggesting potential foreign technological support, though official procurement details remain undisclosed.


3. Economic and Social Fallout: The financial burden placed on civilians and ongoing economic hardships may increase public resentment toward the Taliban, potentially fueling future unrest.



Outlook:
While the Taliban portray the surveillance network as a crime-fighting tool, its primary function appears to be social and political control. Without regulatory oversight, concerns over human rights abuses will likely persist. The network strengthens the Taliban‚Äôs ability to maintain power but may further isolate Afghanistan from the international community.",0,1740683737.0,Intelligence,0,0.5,False

Go to different stores in your area until you figure out which one regularly fills the clearance bins. It's a life changer. I'd never have unnecessary snacks and such if it weren't for my local kroger being so vigilant about expiry dates. 


My kroger *always* has the hookup. 

The dairy section regularly has name brand items for a 3rd of the price. Horizon  & Darigold, even lactose free milk. Oui, 2good, okio (protein!) and chobani (flips & protein!) yogurts for under .78 cents. I haven't bought full priced yogurt in over a year. Dunkins and starbucks cold brew coffee. They frequently have vegan items as well (ironically also in the dairy section lol)

Their dry goods clearance section regularly has pharmacy and grooming items- including otc meds, covid tests, diabetes supplies, sunscreen, razors, hair & beard products, sometimes pregnancy tests, and for some reason, tons of at home drug tests. There's always baby items-formula at least once a month, but usually pouches and other snacks. Every so often they'll have buggies completely full of snack items- I've got bags of Dot's pretzels for $1.75 and No Man's jerky for $3.75. But there's always random foods from every aisle- coffee, nuts, cake mix, chips, candy. 

And they had SO much meat on clearance today. I just bought 7 pounds of chuck beef for $35. I may go back later and see if the chicken is still there üëÄ. I've been craving tikka masala.

1iznqx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1iznqx4/5_years_without_her/,5 Years Without Her,"As the five year anniversary of my mother's death quickly approaches, I find myself more short-tempered, lonely, and generally depressed. The fact of the approaching anniversary hadn't even really consciously registered when this began, but it's been on my mind more and more as the day gets closer. 

I feel as though this marker, five years, is one of those points at which a pretty significant chunk of my life has passed without her, and it's a milestone. I had always thought that by this point in the grieving process, one would have processed and dealt with the feelings and circumstances more than really has turned out to be the case. 

My mom was by far the most important person in the world to me, and she left a black, painful, and ragged hole in my heart and my life when she died. I never knew true grief before that moment, and now I miss life before I did. The unbearable pain I endured fundamentally changed me as a person, and I am no longer as light-hearted, quick to laugh, or able to see the joy in things as I once was. Five years on, I am still not the same person, and I realize I never will be.

I go on, I smile again, I no longer cry at every slightest reminder, but my heart still aches for her so much. I saw a coffee mug in a store today that said something about calling mom, your best friend, and I thought, ""I will never be able to do that again"". My closest confidante with whom I could share anything and that knew me better than anyone ever could have or ever will again is gone forever. I still grapple with the horrifying image of finding her cold, face down, and stiff on the floor, and the unresolved guilt and regret of my last words and interactions with her torment me to this day. 

This time of year, these things tend to come up more in my mind as I think back to that late winter of 2020 and how blissfully unaware I was that my life would so soon be forever changed, and that the innocence and freedom from this existential pain would soon be over for the rest of my life. 

I've learned so much in this journey. Grief never ends. It evolves, it grows, it changes, but it never goes away. I've learned to appreciate life in new ways, and I've grown as a person, but I also feel that I can never appreciate life and feel that same untempered joy in quite the same way again.

This was treated by a lumpectomy and radiotherapy. I rang my friend to tell her my news (we have been friends for 40 plus years, she lives locally a short bus ride ftom me). She was shocked but said you'll be OK. I asked her for her support but I did not see her until June where she met me at cafe in a local supermarket I told her that I would be undergoing surgery after my holiday in July and this was dependant on a MRI scan to make sure in had not spread. My MRI was OK I went on holiday come back had my surgery 3 Aug 2023 I messaged her that the surgery went OK, she rang and visited to me at my house end of Aug. I invited her and her husband to my daughters 21st birthday party as my daughter said it was OK to invite them. I was also waiting test results during this time which I told her about to see if I would need chemo, I was getting the results 2 days before the party. I was worried about the results and messaged to say this but the surgeon had reassured my that the score would be low and it would be unlikely I would need chemo. She messaged me a few weeks before  and said she would not be attending as her husband had a prior event out of town. I messaged her & told her she could still attend but let me know. My test results were OK I didn't need chemo, (however my treatment still was not finished as I would need to undergo 5 rounds of radiotherapy in Oct, the next mnth).The day after she messaged me after saying previously that she was not coming saying that she was waiting for an acquaintance of mine one her best friend's to let her know if she was coming. This was a very awkward situation as it was up to my daughter who was coming I explained the situation that the invitation was for her & her husband not a plus one.  She then said she was not coming I said OK, she then messaged me again on the day of the party again saying she was not coming & she hoped it goes well. Middle of Oct 2023 she messaged said she would ring for a catchup had a convo & explained that I wasn't happy with what had happened & again explained invitation situation she apologised we moved on. We met up in person later in Oct 2023.
 In December 2023 she messaged me and said her mother was in hospital and sadly passed away. I went to the funeral.  Xmas came and went kept in touch by messaging and phone, met up for a pub meal in Feb 2024, Easter, Summer came and went no meet up again kept in touch via messaging and phone. Last time we met up in person for a pub meal Oct 2024, Xmas 2024 came and went she said she would meet me for a night out messaged to arrange and then she said she couldn't afford it as she needed money for her city trip to Berlin this month. My birthday was on 19 Jan she messaged me & wished me happy birthday and again said she would ring for a chat, to-date  I'm still waiting for that call. I have always said to her that if she can't afford to go out we can meet for a coffee at the weekend as she works & is waiting for knee surgery. I'm not asking for  much just a meetup and a laugh like it used to be especially after my cancer diagnosis. I look around and see women of all ages meeting up and enjoying each others company and I ask myself how has our friendship come down to a couple of phone calls, a handful of in person meetups since 2023. I really don't  deserve this, I am now thinking of now distancing myself from her and letting her get on with her own life  Sorry for the length of the post. Any advice appreciated, thanks

This is my first official review post (although I post tons of little mini reviews in comment form). I haven't seen much talk about this newish house on this sub and wanted to share my experience with you!

Since my introduction into indie perfumes in Fall of '23, I'm still discovering what I like and don't like. I generally...  
**Like**: Most fruits, snuggly fuzzy notes, desert inspired scents, vanillas, most woody notes (especially cedar), labdanum, ambers, wine, most florals, chocolate, salt, ozone, Ambergris, coffee, most musks, mint, petrichor  
**Dislike**: violet, heavy smoke, anything overly sweet, Maple syrup  
**It's complicated**: marshmallow, leather, jasmine, peach, orange blossom, neroli, honey, red musk, orris

Someone mentioned this house having a 25% off in a comment about Valentine's sales a couple weeks ago. I went to their site and was really interested since they use a lot of notes that I love, and I loved their Femme Fatale vibe check quiz. I got the sample set (plus 2 freebies) for $21.50 after the discount and including $8 shipping.¬†

**House pros**:

* It was a very fast TAT. I ordered on the 13th and it was delivered on the 18th.
* The samples are cheap.
* They were very generous and gave me two 2ml freebies along with my sample pack.
* They also sent a 20% coupon for a future purchase after I ordered.
* Packaging of the sample set was nice. Even the free samples come with a little card that lists the notes.

**House cons**:

* After the sample size, they only have 30ml bottles. It's priced pretty cheap, though ($50). It's just nice to have like a 10-15ml for people like me who flit around from scent to scent.
* I was minorly irked that their listed notes seemed to vary depending on what image or part of the page you're looking at.
* The sample sprayers varied from spraying a nice diffused mist to some that came sprayed in a sloppy sploot.
* After visiting their site, I was bombarded with social media ads for their stuff (it's a minor complaint, and I get that they need to get their name out there being new).

On to the reviews!¬†

# Le Cirque¬†

*A riot of dark chocolate-covered espresso beans, toasted sugarcane, Mysore sandalwood, Haitian vetiver, and a puff off a Cuban cigar. This is a conversation over a late-night espresso that you never want to end. It is so fun, so rich, and entirely sexy.*

Top: Dark chocolate, espresso, heliotrope  
Base: tobacco, patchouli, vanilla, Haitian vetiver, Mysore sandalwood

My thoughts: The description mentions dark chocolate covered espresso beans, and that absolutely nails the general vibe I get from this one. You know that rich aromatic experience you get crunching on them? This is that in perfume form. It's not at all too sweet, in fact, it's quite dry. The tobacco is the strongest note especially on the dry down which gives a bit of a cigar shop vibe (with no smoke). Perfectly unisex. I feel like this would smell sexy on \*anyone\*. The tobacco/patchouli/sandalwood base gives it a nice vintage feel.¬†

I felt like this is similar to Pineward's **Coffee Tabac**, and looking at the notes, they share a lot of the same ones. Just for funzies I decided to compare the two head to head (or, more fittingly, wrist to wrist). Coffee Tabac is spicier, *much* stronger, greener tobacco, more masc and drier. Le Cirque is smoother, less throw, and more chocolate/vanilla and smells sweeter. Their base of tobacco, patchouli, and vanilla are very similar. Yeah, wow. I forgot how much the Pineward whacks you over the head, lol, like *look at me.* ***I'm*** *the tobacco now.*

Overall: **4.5/5**. Very enjoyable. I'd consider a FS in the future. We'll see how much I reach for my sample.¬†

# Sirius

*This is the sweetest Guatemalan cardamom, rare ruh khus vetiver, black keemun tea oil, and vanilla absolute from madagascar. Unisex and versatile, it starts bright and spicy and dries down into a warm, sweet, and rich woody musk. An olfactory cashmere sweater: warm, soft, a constant favorite.*

Top: Cardamom, fig, vanilla, pink pepper, elemi  
Middle: Osmanthus, black tea  
Base: Mysore sandalwood, tonka, vetiver, benzoin, olibanum

My thoughts: Sirius was love at first spray. It took no convincing. It's so COZY! The fig is the star for most of the wear. I am happy with how long it hangs around. More of a green fig than an overly ripe syrupy one. Osmanthus comes out to play and gives it a nice floral/fruity undertone. During the dry down I get a lot of tonka which I love. This is so, so comforting.... like having a vanillic tea in your garden sitting near a fig tree and blooming Osmanthus. I *don't* much cardamom. It's a fleeting top note that gets overtaken by the fig, but I don't care.¬†Lasting power is very good, can still smell it on my clothes days later.

Overall: **5/5**. Upsizing now. After smelling this one, I can't live without it. Clean, creamy, barely sweet, green, and floral. Fitting for any time of year and any occasion.¬†Obsessed.

# Cloudbreath

*Sweet puffy cloud of bliss. An Airy white musk that floats in a cloud of white floral and sweet lychee notes. Rich, lightly abstract, sweet, and addictive. Made with an abundance of orris butter, royal Hawaiian sandalwood, jasmine flowers, and tonka.*

Top notes: Soft iris, violet, lychee  
Base notes: Malted cream, airy puffs of vanilla, tonka, your last great kiss

My thoughts: See what I mean about notes varying a bit? Jasmine isn't mentioned in the listed notes but its clearly mentioned in the description. Cloudbreath was one of my freebies. Sadly, it's not for me. I just can't with violet because so cloying to my nose. It's a weird uncanny place between powdery and creamy. I suspect a lot of folks here might like it. I'm just not a good judge with violet. The lychee is nice. I really liked the dry down once the violet weened off, but this was at the end of the day--thats how long it took! The lasting power is amazing on this one. I was doing the laundry yesterday and I could still smell that lovely dry-down scent days later on the shirt I sprayed it on. I will also say that this is a violet that I didn't have to scrub off, which is very rare!¬†

Overall: **2/5**. Sweet, creamy violets. Very airy and fluffy. Just not for me.

# Aurate

*This is the classic amber. Sandalwood drenched, labdanum rich, vanilla sweetened. The most golden of gold fragrances.*

Top: Labdanum, vanilla, jasmine  
Base: Sandalwood, good leather, more vanilla

My thoughts: I was sold on getting this sample after going through a story that was 3 slides long on Instagram about the perfumer's quest to create the perfect amber. It involved a scent memory and using labdanum from Crete. After all that's said and done, this is a very nice amber. It's quite smooth. The labdanum, obviously, is the star. Rich and resinous, this scent lasts a long time. Now, I'm an amber perfume and labdanum lover, and, had I discovered this scent a year ago,¬† I probably would have upsized it. But now after collecting a handful of lovely ambers I don't think this one is particularly unique enough to add to my collection. I do keep sniffing it, and it is quite intoxicating.¬†

Overall: **4/5**. For now, it doesn't quite top my favorite ambers (Pulp's **Bewitching Amber**, and Solstice's **Estate Amber**), but still a very solid representation of amber. I'll use up my sample and see how/if my opinion changes.

# Kefi

*A feeling of joy, high spirits, or enthusiasm, often associated with a zest for life. Wonderfully spicy amber fragrance with brightness and depth just like you!*

Top: cardamom, black currant, pink pepper  
Base: sandalwood, vanilla, candied ginger

My thoughts: Kefi is certainly an interesting perfume. It opens almost like cough syrup. There's something about the black currant that is pulling very medicinal. I wasn't sure I'd like it after the I spritzed, but that medicinal smell settles down after it dries. The currant morphs into more of a tart note. Oh wow, this is really lovely....a tart, bright, berry-amber. The ginger is stunning in the way it brightens all the notes. Normally I wouldn't consider a perfume with cardamom and ginger in it a spring perfume but this IS SPRING! After a few hours it's settles into cozy ginger-vanilla-amber.¬†

I did a bit further reading about this scent and the perfumer mentioned that the special black currant bud absolute they used can smell ""slightly phenolic."" Ahh okay yeah now I feel justified in dubbing that challenging opening as a cough syrup smell.¬†

Overall: 4/5. I'm glued to my wrist once it dries.¬†That cough syrup tho....

# Cordial

*This is a snifter of calvados, a caramel apple, a hint of musk. This is a lightly fruity gourmand that reaches for more sophistication than simple candy. A caramel dressed up for a night at the opera. It is playful, sweet, but entirely grown up.*¬†

Top: Ceylon cinnamon, apple, cognac, candied orange peels  
Base: Cashmere musk, vanilla absolute, royal Hawaiian sandalwood, whisky-aged oak barrels, myrrh

My thoughts: Boozy and sweet. I've no idea what calvados smells like, but I certainly get cognac. It doesn't smell like you've been drinking, though. A subtle cinnamon shines as it wafts. Something about this reads as a musky honey to me. It's pretty. I like it. I wish I got more apple and the woody notes, though.¬†

Overall: 3/5. Nice. Almost too sweet for me. Smells like sticking your nose in a glass of a cordial and taking a deep long whiff. A little one-note to my nose. Where are the oak barrels?

# Boh√®me

*Boh√®me is lightly sweet, deep, warm, and unisex. It starts with labdanum, cinnamon, and toffee, and transforms into leather and a bit of smoldering pipe tobacco hovering above that perfect glass of bourbon. The drydown is a honied musk that is just delicious.*

Top: Toffee, vanilla, cinnamon  
Base: Sandalwood, tobacco, smokey caramel, velvet musk. There is also leather here but not barnyard or saddle leather. This is italian sports car leather; soft and precious driving glove leather. In spite of the warm facsimile to a nearly candied suede, this fragrance is totally vegan and cruelty free

My thoughts: This was my other freebie. A deep, almost salty toffee mingles with tobacco, musk, and leather. Boheme is exactly the kind of gourmand I fall head over heels for. It's not too sweet whilst still being super delicious.... yet it also reads as a perfume. I was scared of the toffee note, but my feelings were unjustified. It's very well blended, I don't get any one note taking over. It comes off as golden, toasty, and sweet. The smokey caramel mentioned in the notes isn't overpowering, and I'm sensitive to smoke notes. Once again, unisex and very sexy. The leather note this house uses is very tame and smooth--worth mentioning since I know there are many who are adverse to strong leather scents.

Overall: 4.5/5. Considering a FS. Not sure if I like this or Le Cirque more.

# Final thoughts

Maison des Animaux has made a very good impression on me. These all tend to lean on the more perfumey side of the spectrum, but not quite in a mainstream way (I generally do not like many mainstream perfumes and I know many of you IMAMers feel the same). They all tend to smell very well blended.

I found **Le Cirque, Kefi, Aurate,** and **Boh√®me** to have a similar DNA. For such a small catalog, I do wish they had more variety. That's coming from someone who loves amber, labdanum, vanilla and tobacco notes! If these notes aren't your jam, you're not left with much to choose from, which is unfortunate. Hopefully they will branch it out a bit as they expand their catalog.

I'm so happy I've found a new obsession in **Sirius**! This one even got me a compliment in public from a stranger (cue Handel's *Hallelujah*)!

Their 25% off spring sale is going on through tomorrow, 2/28 code is springfling25.¬†

First-time home buyer here. Married, no kids with $388K of pre-bonus HHI (not bringing bonus into this just given variability). In the DMV which is extremely pricey. Has anyone developed a helpful framework for looking at overall debt / housing burden? Loan advisors have underwritten us at $960K with a 20% down payment, saying that is at the top end of their conservative bucket. Comes out to around $8K of fixed monthly charges (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, utilities, HOA) or \~26% of income. We would cash flow around \~$3K a month after fixed charges, maintenance reserves, taxes, and our average other expenses. Adding that cash flow plus 401k max contributions, we end up with monthly savings of $7K or \~22% of HHI. That makes me feel pretty good but with the cost of potential childcare ($3K / per child in our area and we want to eventually have two) then this rough math all breaks down.

The reality is that we need to spend at least $1.2M to maintain our current lifestyle as renters in one of the better neighborhoods (metro, nice restaurants, coffee shops, etc.). An almost $1M mortgage is kinda freaking me out as I think about future kids, but I also realize this is probably a common issue in a VHCOL city.

Forget magic eight balls. When it comes to retirement planning, AI is the shiny new crystal ball‚Äîbut with slightly more algorithms and slightly less voodoo. With AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok becoming household names, you might be wondering if these digital whiz-kids can make your retirement as golden as promised.

Behold the irony: tech-savvy Gen Z and Millennials are keen on AI's advice, while older generations aren‚Äôt quite sold on letting a machine orchestrate their golden years. It begs the question: Are Boomers right to be skeptical, or are they just missing the boat to the future?

AI's role in retirement planning isn‚Äôt just about crunching numbers‚Äîit's about serving as your personal finance assistant, sifting through the data haystack to find the golden needles. From automating budgeting and forecasting cash flow to managing investments, AI tools are quickly becoming as indispensable as your morning cup of coffee.

But don't hand over the reins just yet. AI might excel in finding the 'most correct' investment strategies, but remember, it's ultimately your responsibility to trust but verify. And no, asking AI for the next Apple stock isn't going to make you an overnight billionaire. Nuanced investments require human intuition blended with machine precision.

Here's the kicker: AI is like an Uber driver for your retirement journey. It's fantastic for getting you from point A to point B, but occasionally, it's worth glancing at the scenery‚Äîor the traffic map. Only you can ask the right questions about your future, and only you can steer the wheel.

So, what's your take: Is AI your trusty GPS in the quest for that comfortable retirement, or just another backseat driver? üßê Let‚Äôs talk shop!",1,1740682892.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

Need an experienced eye‚Ä¶,"Hi, I posted a few weeks ago about my situation and got wonderful feedback, but my situation is getting worse‚Ä¶ sorry for the long post.

My boss is really taking out her personal stress and frustration out on me through micromanaging, distrust, and in my opinion at times trying to set me up for failure or catch me in a trap‚Ä¶ for example, I am to go through her emails multiple times a day and open and delete anything unimportant and bring anything important to her attention. The other day there was a second email sent from a non-legit sender about a past due invoice. I know it wasn‚Äôt legit because when I brought the first email from them to her attention she told me that those emails are essentially a scam from a third party company and that they don‚Äôt need to be responded to. Because of that conversation I knew that this email was unimportant, could be trashed, and didn‚Äôt need to be brought to her attention. But in the evening she messaged me about it and said ‚ÄúThere was a sales and use email that wasn‚Äôt brought to my attention. Did you work today?‚Äù When I responded and told her that yes, I worked, what I had done that day, and why I didn‚Äôt bring that to her attention citing our previous conversation she just responded ‚Äúthat‚Äôs true.‚Äù And didn‚Äôt follow up with anything else‚Ä¶ but why would she bring that email that she knows isn‚Äôt important up as me potentially not doing my job and pointing out important emails to her? This is just a recent example of confusing antics that make me feel like she‚Äôs trying to catch me in the wrong when I‚Äôm doing everything she asks. I‚Äôm being proactive in communicating with her, I‚Äôm regularly updating the task list as she has asked me to do, I‚Äôm logging my hours, etc‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôve also found out through market research and speaking directly with other assistants with comparable experience and responsibilities that I am being severely underpaid. 42,000 a year before taxes in Los Angeles. I work full time for her doing personal tasks, admin tasks for her production work, and admin tasks and errands for the coffee shop that she owns. I‚Äôm also expected to be on call to take care of her daughter when she‚Äôs out of town in case her ex books a job last minute, which he frequently does as he also works in production and often doesn‚Äôt know his schedule until the day before.

It just feels like over the last two months since she went through a personal betrayal with a friend she‚Äôs diverting all of that energy toward me. She‚Äôs heaping on the workload and the stress (I‚Äôm happy to have a large workload if the compensation mirrors that) and micromanaging every task as well as nitpicking every element of the task both while it is in progress and after it is completed. When I try to schedule a conversation she bumps it or just simply says she doesn‚Äôt have time for it‚Ä¶

I wish I could quit, but I haven‚Äôt been making enough money to build my savings (even with careful budgeting). 

I‚Äôm updating my resume and putting feelers out because I know there are better options out there, but in the meantime I‚Äôm feeling hopeless.

TLDR: boss is micromanaging, taking out her personal frustrations on me, severely underpaying me, and will not commit to a meeting/evaluation with me. ",7,1740682825.0,ExecutiveAssistants,3,1.0,False

This makes me sound like a horribly uninterested person, but I do really try to get to know them and am quite a naturally curious person. Most dates I go on are fine and they often ask to meet me again.

This whole process made me realize how quickly we get caught up in life‚Äôs struggles and forget to actually live. We‚Äôre constantly stressed about something instead of just enjoying the moment. Another thing I realized is that no matter what problem I‚Äôm dealing with, there‚Äôs a huge chance that someone else has been through it too. That thought weirdly made me feel a little better.

Hope you enjoy reading :)

# 20s

**Financial and career Struggles**

A lot of people at this age are still living with their parents, not necessarily because they want to, but because rent is ridiculous. Even if you land a decent paying job, which can feel like winning the lottery, it‚Äôs not always enough to cover rent, student loans, and other expenses.

A lot of people in their 20s feel stuck in survival mode, like they‚Äôre running to stay in place. It‚Äôs frustrating because this is supposed to be the time when you explore, take risks, and enjoy life a little.

**Figuring out Life**

A lot of people feel this weird pressure to have their identity figured out, who they are, what they want, what their values, all while social media constantly reminds you that everyone else seems to have it together.

Everyone keeps asking, ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs your plan?‚Äù

The pressure to have everything figured out by a certain age is exhausting. You‚Äôre supposed to be building a career, maintaining a social life, staying fit, and maybe even dating, all while dealing with the anxiety of not knowing if you‚Äôre making the right choices.

**Am I even an adult?**

Then there‚Äôs the whole ‚ÄúAm I even an adult?‚Äù feeling. You‚Äôre paying bills, maybe working a full-time job, but deep down, you still feel like a kid who somehow got thrown into this world of taxes and responsibilities.

**Relationships**

Some people are settling down, some are casually dating, and some are out trying to figure out how to meet people without it being awkward.

**Friendships**

Making friends in your 20s is as hard as dating. Friendships start shifting because people are busy with work, moving away, or in different life stages. It‚Äôs not like school where you see your friends every day, now you actually have to plan to keep in touch. A lot of people start feeling lonely because making new friends as an adult isn‚Äôt as easy as it used to be.

**Family and Independence Struggles**

There‚Äôs often pressure from family, whether it‚Äôs about your career, relationships, or how you‚Äôre supposed to be living. Some parents still treat their adult kids like teenagers. It‚Äôs a weird in-between stage where you‚Äôre technically an adult but not always treated like one.

# 30s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Whether it‚Äôs student loans, credit cards, or a mortgage, it feels like there‚Äôs always something eating up your paycheck before you even get to enjoy it.

Then there‚Äôs the job situation. Some people are thriving, and others are trying to survive the 9-to-5 grind without losing their minds. The idea of switching careers sounds amazing but also terrifying. do I really wanna start from scratch again?

Basically, your 30s are about you juggling money, career moves, and existential crises while trying to sneak in some fun when you can.

**Struggles with Identity**

Your 30s are basically the season finale of your 20s, and suddenly, you‚Äôre questioning everything. Am I where I‚Äôm supposed to be? Did I waste too much time? Is it too late to switch things up?

Regret over past decisions is real. Maybe you wish you had traveled more, taken a different career path, or not been so scared to take risks in your 20s and the fear of being ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to start over.

**Health Concerns**

Hitting your 30s is when you start realizing you‚Äôre not invincible anymore. Suddenly, you wake up with random aches. It‚Äôs that weird stage where you‚Äôre still young, but your body is starting to remind you that you need to take better care of it.

**Friendships**

Everyone‚Äôs busy with careers, relationships, kids, whatever, so you don‚Äôt randomly hang out like you did in your 20s. If you don‚Äôt actively schedule time to see people, friendships can start to fade. And if you‚Äôre single while most of your friends are getting married or having kids, it can feel lonely, like you‚Äôre being left behind while everyone else moves on.

**Relationships**

People know what they want more, so there‚Äôs less playing of games. But on the other hand, dating apps can be exhausting, and there‚Äôs this weird pressure to hurry up and find someone before it‚Äôs too late.

**Burn Out**

A lot of people hit a point where they‚Äôre burnt out. You wake up, do the same routine, and wonder, Is this it?

**Hitting milestones**

A lot of people in their 30s talk about feeling like they haven‚Äôt hit those traditional ‚Äúadult‚Äù milestones, marriage, kids, homeownership, a clear sense of direction, and it makes them wonder if they‚Äôre behind or playing by a different set of rules.

**getting old**

One day, you‚Äôre living your life, and then suddenly, things start changing. You see college kids and realize they were born in the 2000s, you catch yourself groaning when you stand up, and you actually start caring about things like fiber intake and a good night‚Äôs sleep. It‚Äôs not even that you‚Äôre old, but you definitely don‚Äôt feel as young and carefree as before.

# 40s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Some are doing well, stacking up savings and growing their income, but many others feel behind, still paying off debt, worrying about retirement, or wondering if they‚Äôll ever own a home.

If you‚Äôre doing well, you‚Äôre probably stressing about keeping it that way. If you‚Äôre struggling, it‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄúOkay, so do I ever get to retire, or am I working until I drop?‚Äù

**Health Concerns**

For a lot of people, physical health starts demanding attention in ways it never did before. Suddenly, that random back pain isn‚Äôt going away, your knees sound like bubble wrap, and somehow, ear hair becomes a thing.

Now you‚Äôve got routine screenings to schedule, cholesterol levels to monitor, and friends casually dropping the phrase, ‚ÄúI have to get a colonoscopy next week.‚Äù

**Friendships**

Social circles shrink, not because you don‚Äôt want friends, but because who has the time? You text back and forth with someone for months trying to plan a coffee meet-up, and by the time you actually get together, you‚Äôre both exhausted.

The loneliness can sneak up on you, too. You‚Äôre constantly surrounded by people, kids, coworkers, family, but deep down, you might feel like no one really sees you.

**Relationships**

Some people are happily settled, but a lot of couples hit rough patches, realizing they‚Äôre more like co-managers of a household than actual partners. Divorce happens, and for those newly single in their 40s, dating can feel like a completely different game. Some people have never been married and are wondering if it‚Äôs too late to find love

**Parents and Kids**

If you have young kids, you‚Äôre probably running on caffeine and whatever sleep you can grab. Finding even five minutes of personal time feels like a luxury. And for some, it‚Äôs not just raising kids, it‚Äôs also managing aging parents.

**Questioning life decisions**

A lot of people hit their 40s and start questioning everything. Did I pick the right career? Am I where I thought I‚Äôd be by now? Is it too late to switch things up? ‚ÄúWait, is this it?‚Äù And then there‚Äôs the looming realization that time is moving fast, which can trigger anxiety about aging, regrets, and the whole ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my purpose?‚Äù spiral.

**getting old**

you start catching yourself saying, ‚ÄúBack in my day‚Ä¶‚Äù Like, you don‚Äôt even mean to, but it slips out.

Then there‚Äôs the unsolicited life advice. You see a younger person stressing about something in life and you go ahead and start giving advices like there is no tomorrow. You know you used to roll your eyes when older people did this to you. You used to think, ‚ÄúOkay, Grandpa, relax.‚Äù But now you are that person.

Starting to understand life

You start realizing what really matters. The friendships you do have become deeper. You start caring less about what people think and more about what makes you happy. And despite all the chaos, you get these moments, watching your kids grow, laughing with an old friend, seeing your parents smile.

# 50s

**Financial and career Struggles**

Some people are coasting toward retirement with a solid plan, while others are looking at their bank accounts thinking, Wait, I was supposed to save how much?

You start realizing ageism is very real. Suddenly, you‚Äôre removing graduation years from your r√©sum√© and praying that hiring managers don‚Äôt do the math when they see your experience.

You‚Äôd think experience would count for something, but nope, many companies seem more interested in hiring younger workers.

Health Concerns

Spinal issues, joint pain, weight gain that refuses to budge, and for some, even hair loss. One day, you‚Äôre fine, and the next, you need reading glasses to read a restaurant menu.

**Trying to Keep up**

Technology moves fast, and for a lot of older adults, keeping up can feel like a full-time job. It‚Äôs not about learning new apps, it‚Äôs about constantly adapting to updates, security changes, and entirely new systems. One day, you finally figure out how to use a smartphone, and the next, everything moves to AI and the metaverse.

In the workplace, this can be a huge issue. If you‚Äôre in your 50s or 60s and job hunting, employers might expect you to know software that wasn‚Äôt even a thing when you started your career. And if you don‚Äôt? Well, good luck getting hired.

**Getting old**

Society loves to remind people that they‚Äôre ‚Äúgetting older,‚Äù whether it‚Äôs by showing you targeted ads for anti-aging cream or watching younger coworkers speak an entirely different language.

the world starts treating them differently. They might be overlooked in the job market, assumed to be ‚Äúout of touch,‚Äù or not taken as seriously.

You start noticing that movies and shows don‚Äôt center people your age anymore unless they‚Äôre playing the wise mentor.

**Dating**

If you‚Äôre single at 50, whether by choice, divorce, or life happening, the dating scene can feel‚Ä¶ weird. But on the flip side, dating at this age can also be freeing, you know what you want, you‚Äôre not playing games, and you‚Äôre definitely not wasting time on people who don‚Äôt bring you peace.

**Relationships**

A 10- or 20-year gap might not matter much in your 30s and 40s, but once one partner hits their 60s or 70s, the differences become more obvious. One person might still want to travel and be active, while the other is slowing down. Then, there‚Äôs the reality of caregiving. If you‚Äôre the younger partner, you might find yourself taking care of an aging spouse way earlier than expected. That can be tough, both emotionally and physically.

**empty nest**

For parents, there‚Äôs the whole empty nest transition. One day, your house is filled with noise, chaos, and grocery bills that make no sense, and the next, you‚Äôre standing in a too-quiet kitchen wondering if you should text your kid or if that makes you clingy.

**Starting to understand life**

By 50, you‚Äôve probably got a solid sense of who you are, you care way less about what people think, and if you‚Äôre lucky, you might finally have the wisdom and the financial means to do things you actually enjoy.

The awareness of time becomes very real. You start thinking less about climbing ladders and more about making memories. It‚Äôs not so much about having time as it is about using it well. That‚Äôs why a lot of people in their 50s start prioritizing experiences over things, traveling, picking up hobbies, reconnecting with old friends, or even making a big career change.

**Mental Health**

Mental health can take a hit in your later years. There‚Äôs grief from losing loved ones, anxiety about the future, and even feeling lost. A lot of people hit their 50s or 60s and realize they don‚Äôt know who they are outside of work or family responsibilities. That can lead to some deep self-reflection or, for some, a midlife crisis.

**Loneliness**

Retirement sounds great in theory no work, no stress, and free time. But for a lot of people, work was their main source of social interaction. Once that‚Äôs gone, it can be really hard to meet new people.

**Housing**

Figuring out housing as you get older is a huge decision. A lot of people start thinking about downsizing, maybe moving into a smaller home, a condo, or even a 55+ community. These places can be great because they‚Äôre designed for older adults, often with social activities, maintenance-free living, and a quieter environment. But on the flip side, they can feel too isolated, like living in a bubble with no younger people around.

# 60

**Financial and career Struggles**

A lot of people in their 60s are feeling the pressure when it comes to money and retirement. Some thought they‚Äôd be chilling by now, but instead, they‚Äôre stressing over savings (or lack of them), pensions that don‚Äôt exist, and whether they can actually afford to stop working.

**Getting old**

Then there‚Äôs the whole longevity and quality-of-life thing. A lot of people in their 60s are thinking about how to stay independent for as long as possible. Nobody wants to feel like a burden or lose control over their own life, but aging comes with its own challenges.

**Health Concerns**

You wake up feeling tired, and tasks that used to be easy suddenly take twice as much effort. Then there‚Äôs the joint pain. It‚Äôs not discomfort, it‚Äôs a constant battle to keep moving despite the pain. And if you slow down too much, it gets worse.

Cognitive decline is something a lot of people worry about. Maybe it‚Äôs forgetting little things here and there or feeling like your brain takes longer to process stuff.

Loneliness

Then, there‚Äôs the emotional side of aging. Losing friends and family over time can be really tough, and social circles start shrinking. People get busy with their own lives, and sometimes, you realize you‚Äôre spending way more time alone than you used to.

**Legacy**

At a certain point, thoughts about legacy and mortality start creeping in more often. It‚Äôs not about how much time is left but how to make it count.

It‚Äôs also a time for reflection, looking back at the choices made, the paths taken (or not taken), and wondering what kind of impact was left behind. For some, that means giving back, writing a memoir, or making sure they‚Äôve said what needs to be said to the people who matter.

There‚Äôs also the reality of how to face the final years with dignity, purpose, and hopefully, peace. No one likes to dwell on mortality, but it‚Äôs natural to think about how to make the most of the time that remains.",10,1740682674.0,Life,5,1.0,False

How can I help him?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half. In this time he has been consistently doing ZYNS. I didn't have a huge issue with nicotine, I occasionally smoke a cigarette and we used to smoke weed (it's legal in our state) but for the last 6 months I have been sober from all substances.  He has been ramping up in the department of drugs and alcohol a LOT. It started when we were long distance and I noticed a lot more drinking and a considerably more Zyn intake. He would drink 3-4 beers each night and started putting bourbon in his coffee each morning, which has continued to before classes now. It got to the point where I reached out to a trusted friend of his, and they had a conversation to make sure he was okay.  This was around November.

On to the issues now. I made it clear I wanted him to quit a vice. I struggle with my own issues of hurting myself and have come a long way with his help, so I wanted to try and do the same for him. I asked him to quit his ZYN habit. He has an addictive personality, and I figured the extra money from no longer buying two packs a week would be a good addition. He told me he quit. I helped him through awful withdrawals, he yelled at me and cried in my arms, and we had a solution. Used the same flavor gum to get the 'Mouth feeling' he was missing, and I had to babysit him to make sure he wouldn't go to the gas station to buy more. It's been about 3 weeks since that point and today I found his stash, ON HIS PERSON. He had these for over a week, and in this time we had talked, and I told him so many times how proud I was of him. I know that if he told me the day he bought them it would have been ok, but the lying is what makes it so bad. 

I don't know how to help him, or even if I can. I want to marry this man and I just want to support him through this addiction. Because that is absolutely what it is, he even calls himself an addict. I have had friends quit vaping, but never ZYN, so if anyone has any tips to give him or how I can support him, please let me know.

I have a full-time job and including commute time it takes 8.30 am to 8  pm roughly. The only time I can hit the gym is right after work as I don't have any other free time. My workouts last for 1.5 hours due to all the rests and fatigue and I feel incredibly sleepy and sluggish.

I also feel sleep deprived at night. My body feels tired and kinda alert at the same time. If you can relate. So, even if I am in bed, I cannot fall asleep until it's 4/5 am, and then I gotta wake up at 7 am again.

1izndpc,https://i.redd.it/u0f2fdfoaqle1.jpeg,Little Influences,"(edited to adhere to sub rules, still features negative thoughts but with a positive outcome)


Lately, I've struggled with feeling worthless. I've felt like less than nothing, like a bother to others.

I work at a salon, front desk. This would be my twelfth day working open to close. As long as I stay on top of keeping the lobby clean, the fridge stocked, emails checked, phones answered, appointments set, clients welcomed, stylists informed, reports posted on time, schedule optimized, product stock accurate, grocery orders put away, and clients checked out- It's an easy job. The easiest I've had.

I'm visibly queer, which sometimes gets me nasty looks from certain clients. They tend to interrupt me when I'm following the professional flow of greeting, if not outright pass me to sit in the lobby when I'm helping someone else. I can usually chalk up the behavior to them having a bad day, but for some they have a problem with me specifically. They'll glare me down, ignore my attempt at small talk while I'm serving their drink or waiting for the card reader to activate- yet they're all smiles and warmth with their stylist. When those interactions add up, it gets to me. It's just a job, but with especially regular clients, I want to add to the positive and relaxing experience, not sour it. I don't want to be in their way.

There's one man, we'll call him Rick. When I started working here two years ago, he was a little standoffish, particular with how his services were done. He had a habit of missing appointments entirely, but at least never argued when we had to collect no-show fees. 

The first thing I learned about Rick was that he has two purse dogs. The second thing I learned was that he works at a law firm of some sort-- so a busy guy. His no-shows made a little more sense. Third, I learned he's a Jehovah's Witness, which usually makes me wary. He never proselytized or judged me for who I was, which I appreciated. I think when he told me, he was expecting me to snub him for it. He started to warm up to me after that, his smiles were less formal and he'd ask me about my day.

Well, his no-shows kept happening, and each time I called him, he'd apologize and take the blame. We tried a few things. First, I'd call him the day before an appointment, then an hour before. I could have been bitter and waved it off as ""He's a grown man who should know better"". He was still paying, so the business wasn't taking any sort of hit from it. I couldn't stop thinking about how disappointed in himself he sounded when I'd call him about a missed appointment. ""I'm a mess, I'm so sorry. It's me."" 

I know how it feels to have a brain that works differently than it ""should"". I wanted to help and not add to that shame.

Rick has his appointments auto-scheduled for once a week. I decided to look at the ones coming up and write the dates and times on a sticky note. To make sure the offering didn't come off as condescending, I added a doodle of a cat on a UFO. At checkout, I presented the list and apologized if it was overstepping, but he was delighted by it and complimented my drawing.

He didn't miss a single appointment afterward. When we got through the list, I made another with a doodle of a dog skateboarding. After the third list, he said he wouldn't need them anymore, he's shown up consistently since without my help.

Fast forward to yesterday, Rick arrived early for his appointment and I asked him how he's doing. He said that since I gave him those lists, he put an effort into improving his time-management skills. Apparently the first time I gave him one, it turned his day around. He said he had ADHD, and the biggest problem had been remembering events and when to leave somewhere and arrive on time to the next thing. He's since been working with a specialist and has his own alarms and lists to keep him on track. 

Rick also said that he loved my dog doodle and bought an art book on how to draw animals. He draws them on cards for friends and family. They love it, and it makes him happy. His favorite animal to draw is sheep. 

I asked if he would draw me one on a sticky, and he explained each step as he did. That sticky is on my computer monitor, because it's a goofy little guy that makes me smile. It's also a good reminder that if I push past assumptions, if I put away my fear of others, if I choose to be kind, I CAN affect people. People who, in the scheme of their life, I'm just a blip within. That's the power of existence.

It's easy to forget, but I've done this before. I know about how Brent used to have intense asthma and tended to get pneumonia as a kid, that he has a queer son who he learned to accept because he didn't want to lose him. I get hyped to see Cole because he's energetic, witty, and commiserates with me about shitty current events. Mr.Smith works with the fire department, and he's helped me get over my fear of police/servicemen. Barry, a veteran, brought me the most delicious coffee with cinnamon and cayenne just because he was blown away at how good it tasted and he simply wanted to share that with me. A few notice when I'm out sick and comment on my absence. I've been consistently kind even to those who snap at me or dismiss me, and some of them softened up. It's easy to remember the bad interactions, but there's just as many pleasant ones.

People you've met only once will think about you even when you're not right in front of them. You can change a stranger's mood just by offering a little help. You have an impact, you are not nothing. Keep trying.

I am 14 w tomorrow with my first. 35 y/o (shoutout to the oldies but goodies). Never had acid reflux in my life and threw up bile in the middle of the night last night (after taking a tums - which I've tried twice and both times they made me vomit). The GERD is out of control. I sleep elevated, have taken almost everything out of my diet (i'm so hungry), taking papaya enzymes. I didn't even know that I had heartburn because I've never experienced it so i kept telling the midwife my stomach hurt... I finally caved and tried pepcid and that helped immensely but knew i'd need it 2x a day off the bat. I HATE taking medications, partially because i have reactions to almost everything, and partially because i like to think my body will figure it out if i help it along. I realize pregnancy is so different and that my body doesn't actually know WTF is happening so i've relinquished a bit in this area. 

  
That all said - what's worked for you? This morning I tried some lemon in my water, a digestive enzyme, breathing exercises, and some stomach massage ( i didn't take the pepcid this am), and these things seemed to help immensely!!

The tea that was sent to me was fake , sold by a fraudulent vendor on Amazon imitating the real thing.  

This caused myself and mum to be sick , I reached out to Amazon and reported it to the real vendor as well. They offered me 20$ then 50$ which I declined then moved me to Sedwick to process the claim and they finally offered $200. This is still not reasonable considering the circumstances. What‚Äôs a good number to add to my demand letter in response?

1izn75x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dryfasting/comments/1izn75x/first_impressions_of_dry_fasting_and_a_hello_to/,First Impressions of Dry Fasting and a Hello to Any Fellow ZCers,"I completed a 24 hour dry fast this morning, my first experience with this type of fasting.  Do you consider 24 hours a fast?  I have long been interested in intermittent feeding/fasting and water fasting for many years, but the longest I ever went was 5 days of water fasting.  I did that in the summer of 2022 to try to kick start a new health journey; I was trying to address a chronic inflammatory condition that doctors were no help with and I was at my wit's end.  When I began eating again after the 5 days, I went low carb for the first time in my life, then dropped the carbs further into a ketogenic range and ultimately wound up zero carb/carnivore (ZC), where I've been since November of 2022 (I was strict for 12 months but loosened up after that, allowing ""treat days"" periodically but ZC is always the baseline, for weeks and months at a time.  I may never rely on carbohydrate/plants for nutrition, energy, or sustenance ever again--they are entertainment for me to enjoy very sparingly and with full consent.)

However, since adopting this way of eating, I've more or less followed the mantras of r/carnivore and r/zerocarb which are:  fasting is contraindicated, being ZC adapted is our natural metabolic state, eat whenever you're hungry, if there is a problem, eat more, etc.  I think these subs are definitely geared towards beginners, and to erring on the side of caution when it comes to quantities.  More than enough is better than not enough.  And to be fair it's more or less worked for me.  I began lifting seriously and going on long walks regularly and eating tons of meat and stayed in pretty damn good shape--my body composition shifted from leaner than ever when I cut carbs (6'3"", 185 pounds), to fuller and stronger than ever after a year of serious lifting and ZC (215 pounds).  Then I quit caffeine (black coffee) and nicotine (dip pouches) in September of 2024.

And that changed me.  I almost instantly put on 15-20 pounds.  Whatever it is about that cocktail of chemicals I was putting in my body every day, it was helping to stave off weight gain.  Obviously, it's great that I quit them.  Both of them are truly contraindicated.  Being on the other side of chemical dependency and addiction now is like night and day.  I have better and more consistent energy, my skin has improved dramatically, my sleep is better, my mood is better, I never feel rushed by anything.  It's truly a blessing for me to be free of caffeine and nicotine, and I'm never looking back.  I credit ZC for making it easier and for giving me the confidence to just do it after 25 years of addiction to both.

But the weight gain, even on ZC:  it happens to some people, and I am one of them.  I realize now that I have an supernaturally large appetite that requires active taming and discipline.  I never undereat, still, or at least it doesn't feel like it.  I've been experimenting with 12-18 hour dry fasts for a little while, but when I eat, I make sure to eat big to fuel the day and my workouts--big ass ribeye steaks, chuck roast, eggs drenched in butter.  I'm a big man and I still need to eat big to feel optimal, but I've finally found myself at the place all the ZC influencers and subreddits said I'd never be: counting ""calories"", tracking what I'm eating, etc., or else my weight WILL balloon.  I've considered the possibility that after so many years abusing nicotine and caffeine, that my body has a lot of healing to do, and a state of insulin resistance and weight gain might be happening to help facilitate repair processes.  I think this might be what ZC influencers and doctors would suggest.  And they would say just be patient.  That's no consolation for me as my midsection grows by the week.  I will say this--I've gained and lost a lot of weight in my life--this does feel different.  In my previous life, weight gain was always accompanied by a relative decline in health and vitality.  I feel the exact opposite now; amazing, like there has been a massive increase in health and vitality since I quit, in spite of the weight gain.  But I still want to lose the weight, which is very obviously central adiposity.

2 days this week I did OMAD and 1 20-hour dry fast and 1 24-hour dry fast.  I even went for a long treadmill walk that included steep inclines and free weights and I was drenched in sweat, having not drank any liquids in 22 hours at that point.  I feel as light as a feather and despite uneven sleep during the 24 hour, I feel vital and energized and accomplished, even if it was a small accomplishment.  I've heard it said that fasting is like a muscle group that needs regular exercise to stay in shape and I've let it atrophy the last couple years while I absolutely smashed a ton of meat.  Now I feel is a time for austerity and some periodic fasting, but it will always be dry now that I've had a taste of it.

On ZC, your way of eating is your choice, and to anyone thriving on whatever diet they utilize, I say rock on.  I gravitated to ZC out of desperation to correct an absolutely abysmal health status that included chronic inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, and it worked.  So that's why I continue to do what I do.  I didn't come here to debate diet theory; for me, ZC and periodic dry fasting seem like a perfect pairing so I look forward to continuing the experiment, working out that latent muscle group and gently increasing my tolerance for the practice of dry fasting.

Sorry for the long post.

Upon the first spray, the immediate smell of lush dark roses is at the very front of the scent. There‚Äôs also a tea-like note behind the roses, giving it a deep and moody feel.

After 30 minutes or so, the rose smell is just as powerful as the rest of the middle notes that are now more apparent. A wonderfully sweet yet subtle coffee scent that really brings out the blend of rich rose smell. 

Once it‚Äôs fully dried after an hour or so, the notes continue to evolve. The rose is still fresh and at the forefront. The scent is a bit more herbal, more of those tea leaf scents with a hint of frankincense are noticeable, yet don‚Äôt take away from the top notes.

My husband(30M) and me(31F) moved into his parent‚Äôs house to save money and maybe buy a house. We pay $350 each to live there (this is important to know later). I help clean and clean whatever she wants help with, and me and my husband buy our own groceries. We will call my husband Devin for the sake of the story.

The problems started when I realize his mom had severe emotional problems. It took me awhile to put a name to this thing that she does, but I finally figured it out, damsel in distress. The first time me and Devin heard his mom screaming out while we were in the bedroom together watching a movie, we ran out to go help her. When we asked her what was wrong she says between tears that she can‚Äôt get the coffee maker working.  Devin calmed her down and I went to back to the bedroom and just thought it was a one off thing, a deviation from the norm. Maybe she was having a bad day, I don‚Äôt know. Well for a month straight she has been crying hysterically at least four times a day, specifically when me and Devin are alone together and she will keep crying/screaming/yelling until Devin comes to her ‚Äúrescue‚Äù. It‚Äôs really annoying at this point and almost every time she does this, there is nothing wrong, she cries if the keys fall on the floor, she loses her debit card or phone, or when she‚Äôs confused, etc. Every time she does this he still comes coming to rescue her or calm her down. I‚Äôm so used to hearing yells at this point that I don‚Äôt bother asking what was wrong when he‚Äôs done calming down his mom. If his mom and her husband get into a fight, she takes out her anger on Devin. She relies on Devin for everything including all her emotional needs. It‚Äôs literally emotional incest. Not to mention when talking with her she‚Äôs said ‚Äúwhen I found out I was having Devin I was so happy because boys always take care of their mom‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúI would have killed myself if I didn‚Äôt have a boy, I would never want a daughter‚Äù, YIKES. She‚Äôs treated my husband like her surrogate boyfriend since we‚Äôve moved in here and it‚Äôs really concerning.

Anyways despite the fact that she can‚Äôt regulate her emotions, she‚Äôs terrible with money too. Mind you she receives $700/mo from both me and Devin combined, plus she gets $1,600/mo from disability, $400 in food stamps, and she has free healthcare with Medicaid. She doesn‚Äôt have a car payment or house because her mom (Devin‚Äôs grandma) bought her the house and car. She only pays for internet and electric. She should have enough to pay these bills considering she has $2,300 to pay these two small bills. Well since we‚Äôve moved in she complains about not having enough money. We know that the electric and internet are about to be turned off because they sent notices in the mail and saw them. I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs doing with all that money when my husband and I have given her an extra $250 between the two of us. A few days ago I gave her $50 and then she said she was going to the casino after complaining that she needed cat food. I was so pissed learning that she was going to the casino when I can‚Äôt even afford to a casino. What really pissed me off is that she feels entitled to me and my husband‚Äôs wedding money and our wedding gifts that came from my friends from our wedding registry on Amazon. I had to hide all the money that I got from my family so that she wouldn‚Äôt ask for it because she wouldn‚Äôt know.

Devin‚Äôs dad is a bum, he hasn‚Äôt worked since Devin was born (the 90‚Äôs) and he never helped raise him or Devin‚Äôs brothers the entire time. Devin‚Äôs mom won‚Äôt leave him despite all the fighting and how he‚Äôs done nothing for her or his own kids. It‚Äôs sort of sad but she‚Äôs a grown woman she should be able to stick up for herself. That‚Äôs why Devin‚Äôs dad hasn‚Äôt stepped in to help stop the emotional incest.

Besides the constant hysterical crying and how badly she spends money, she acts like a child. She‚Äôs 55 and uses a baby voice and uses child like body language and gestures when she talks to Devin. It‚Äôs really weird to be honest and I don‚Äôt know what to make of it. She depends so much on my husband and sometimes her two other kids to have her emotional needs met and it‚Äôs truly toxic. I‚Äôm just worried that if he doesn‚Äôt put a stop to this behavior she‚Äôs going to get between me and him and possibly make having kids with him hard by how she won‚Äôt want a grand kid to get the attention from Devin and his brothers when we plan to have kids in 1-2 years after we have our own place. I can‚Äôt imagine she can handle not being the star of the show 24/7. She already has started treating me different since me and Devin got married but it‚Äôs only getting worse. She complains that we take up space in the fridge but constantly gets mad if we even use her condiments or her sugar for our coffee. It doesn‚Äôt make sense.

She doesn‚Äôt just treat David like this, she is very weird towards his brother‚Äôs girlfriend and calls her a slut and says she wants to beat her up, the girl is only 20 years old mind you. It‚Äôs really gross behavior. She only started saying that stuff when his brother‚Äôs girlfriend called out that him and his mom had a weird and unusual relationship and she took full offense and has villainized her.

We are already looking at places to move because I told him how I‚Äôd rather just struggle to save up for a house than deal with his mother. He said his mom was ‚Äúnever this bad‚Äù when I asked him why he would have us move in here with how his mom acts (as well as his dad). I am just worried that she‚Äôs going to annoy us all the time when we move out and beg him to come over all the time (2-4 times a week) like she did when Devin lived in my apartment (before we moved in with her to save money). She used to throw tantrums and start fights with him over text if he didn‚Äôt come over before.

I didn‚Äôt know she was like this before I moved in or else I wouldn‚Äôt have moved in at all. He just now understood how emotionally incestuous this relationship was after I explained to him my concerns and how she talks about Devin and his brothers with me (she used to like me before we officially tied the knot). I don‚Äôt know how long Devin has been dealing with this shit but I‚Äôm pretty upset that he brought me into this when we had our own apartment together. Advice?

Edit: it won‚Äôt let me go to the top of the text to edit but I have asked Devin to kindly tell his mom that if she needs to talk to him or she‚Äôs upset about something to stop screaming at odd hours of the night or crying hysterically and instead she should knock on the door to have him help her but he insists that she does it for attention so it won‚Äôt stop.

TL;DR: husband‚Äôs mom treats my husband and his brothers like they are her boyfriends. She has no concept of boundaries and takes out her marriage problems on my husband. She‚Äôs really possessive of her sons to a creepy point. She is also bad with money and asks for more money and our wedding money and the two small bills she has still aren‚Äôt paid. We are moving out soon for obvious reasons. Advice?",18,1740681623.0,Mildlynomil,12,0.91,False

Caffeine pills have gained significant popularity across various online communities, particularly on forums like Reddit. Users frequently share their experiences, insights, and recommendations regarding these pills, making it a vibrant topic of discussion. Whether you‚Äôre a student seeking to boost your focus during exams or a professional needing an energy lift during a long workday, caffeine pills can provide an effective solution.

One of the most commonly discussed benefits of caffeine pills on Reddit is their convenience. Unlike traditional sources of caffeine such as coffee or energy drinks, pills offer a precise dosage without the need for preparation. This aspect is particularly appealing to those who are constantly on the go or trying to manage their caffeine intake more strictly.

Many Reddit users emphasize the benefits of caffeine pills over liquid caffeine in terms of calorie control and sugar intake. While energy drinks and flavored coffees often come loaded with sugar and unnecessary calories, caffeine pills deliver a straightforward energy boost without the extra baggage. However, users also caution that moderation is key; overconsumption can lead to jitters, increased heart rate, and headaches.

When discussing brands, Redditors often recommend well-known options like NoDoz and Vivarin, but they also highlight the importance of researching and choosing a product that aligns with personal health needs. Tips for safe use, such as starting with a lower dose and being mindful of timing, are frequently shared within these discussions. It's essential to remember that individual responses may vary, making it important to listen to your body.

In conclusion, if you're considering incorporating caffeine pills into your routine, tapping into the vast wealth of information and personal anecdotes available on Reddit can provide valuable insights. With careful consideration and responsible usage, caffeine pills can be an effective tool for enhancing productivity and focus.

My Husband and I (25 M & F) are from Seattle/Tacoma WA. My husband works for the airlines and the plane that he flies isn‚Äôt based out of Seattle. So when looking at bases that he can fly out of we ultimately chose MSP. 

We‚Äôre both born and raised in WA (I‚Äôm 5th gen PNWer) both our families ironically immigrated to the US to Minnesota in the 1800s. But I‚Äôm 5th gen PNWer. So the idea of leaving is actually painful. But husband commuting for work is slightly worse.

We are looking for neighborhoods to move to. It‚Äôs been really hard for us to accept saying goodbye to the beautiful puget sound. But commuting is just too much for us. We have a toddler and are eventually wanting to have more kids. We love being near water, libraries, parks, farmers markets, coffee shops, cutesy walkable downtowns and feeling a sense of community. We‚Äôre extremely laid back people who don‚Äôt necessarily want to be in the heart of the city if that makes sense. Ideally would like to live near other young families because we really want to make friends with people who have kids. We‚Äôre like the only ones here in WA our age who have career and kid. It‚Äôs very out of the norm.

The Midwest is appealing to us because of how family centered it is (at least our impressions of it, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong ü•≤).  I feel like we both give off majorrr midwesterner vibes. Like we love and appreciate homes and taking care of them, helping neighbors no questions and fostering a sense of community. MN specifically appeals to us because it‚Äôs also a blue state that also has excellent education and healthcare like WA. Hopefully won‚Äôt have asssss big of a culture shock. But again I‚Äôm probably very ignorant in that landscape as well. ü§≠

We just want to make sure we make the right move and aren‚Äôt traumatized haha. Thank you for sitting and reading my word vomit. I appreciate you. Feel free to leave advice/suggestions or humble me in the comments. Either way it‚Äôs appreciated üòÜ",2,1740681006.0,TwinCities,46,0.55,False

I started Zepbound about a year ago and am essentially at goal! ü•π 5'8"" f, started at 236, and thought 175 sounded attainable. I've since passed that # and am now at 167. ü§ò

One thing I've been lacking in is dedication to a workout routine. Some weeks I'd be better at it than others, but this week I decided to start going Monday-Friday, to really turn it into a solid routine. I go to Orangetheory, the only workout program/gym I have ever enjoyed, and have been a member on and off since 2018. Today will be day 4 in a row, and I am H-U-N-G-R-Y. Like, ordered high protein snacks off Amazon hungry. 

- BUT -

I'm hungry for whole foods (mostly). Dinner was leftover shrimp and zucchini pasta. It wasn't a particularly large serving so I was oddly still hungry...for a protein shake. Had that for dessert and was satisfied! 

This morning: still hungry after a small breakfast of cottage cheese and coffee. I started thinking about lunch at ‚Äî the horror ‚Äî noon instead of 3 or 4 pm. üòÇ So I made two slices of Dave's Good Seed thin sliced bread and two eggs (PRECIOUS CARGO!!). The fiber and protein was the perfect amount to satisfy the hunger. 

And on top of it all, I dropped 2 lbs this week after stalling for about 2 months. Although at this point it's not so much a stall since I'm past my original goal! 

TLDR: 
It's said on here all the time but we all mean it: EAT! When your body wants fuel it tells you, and you shouldn't ignore those cues on Zepbound/Mounjaro. Food is not the enemy, our relationship with it is. And if you find yourself fighting hunger cues on your Zeppy journey, it's likely that your relationship just needs a little work! üòä Exercise is good and doesn't have to break you, find something you enjoy; it really does help!",7,1740680965.0,Zepbound,3,0.9,False
1izmqxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1izmqxo/joe_k_part_10/,Joe K - Part 10,"K cautiously crept into Malevich Square like he was entering a war zone, checking every window in every block, and even the rooftops, expecting a toothless sniper to have him in his sights. That was when he noticed, for the first time, the CCTV cameras - one on the top of each block. How long have they been there? he wondered. The rest of the journey into town wasn't any less stressful. Every thin, hooded figure was a zephyr, intent on doing him some kind of harm - one on the walk to the bus stop, two on the bus, another one getting on the bus, another three on the walk to the surgery on Rembrandt Way. There wasn't any in the waiting room but that security camera was definitely looking right at him. It wasn't looking at the old man attempting to capture as much light as possible from the high window, to assist his reading of *National Geographic*, or the young woman in a pink baseball cap and matching headphones, filing each of her nails four times before repeating the routine, and watching a video on her crotch-balanced mobile phone, or the other young woman with her yellow pencil skirt riding up on the seat, exposing her flabby, fake-tanned thighs, as she failed to comfort a crying baby and thumbed her mobile phone, or the middle-aged woman in the hijab, picking invisible bits of fluff off her clothes and bilingually exchanging the latest gossip on her mobile phone, or the jelly-faced woman sneezing at her mobile phone, or the cream-faced woman in a low-cut top, leaning forward and eyeing the young man opposite over the rim of her mobile phone, or the young man opposite, enjoying the attention but doing his best to ignore it by keeping his own eyes rigidly fixed on his mobile phone, or the person of indeterminate age and indeterminate gender with an indeterminate tattoo on their neck, very determinately getting up, walking three times around the room, clockwise, while staring at the floor, and sitting back down. It wasn't looking at any of them, but they all looked at him with dismay and envious contempt when his name was called. He'd been waiting less than five minutes.

Dr Sinha was Scottish Asian woman in her mid-forties, with magnificent, large brown eyes, engaging enough to put even the most anxious of patients at ease. It turned out, she was a specialist in autism, Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders so, after a rudimentary physical examination, she proceeded to assess K's cognitive functioning. She tested his memory, concentration, attention to detail, decision making skills, problem-solving skills and emotional response to facial expressions, before finishing off with a standard empathy test. Then she asked him how he felt about the assessment.

""It was fun,"" he said. ""I'm already feeling better. Have you got any more?""

""You didn't feel that it was an invasion of privacy?""

""Not at all. I've had my privacy invaded a lot in recent weeks, and it's a refreshing change to be able to give my full consent.""

""Yes, Broker told me, it's a shame I never had the chance to meet you before the unfortunate circumstances of your arrest. It's a wee bit harder to get an accurate reading without any previous results to compare them with. May I ask you a few personal questions?""

""Well, if you're *that* determined to invade my privacy, I surrender.""

""Are you single at the moment?""

""It's nice of you to ask, and, if you don't mind me saying, your a very attractive woman, but it's a little unprofessional, don't you think, doctor?"" K noticed that her expression didn't change one way or the other, and wondered if her interest in neurodiversity might have been sparked by her own personal experience. Then, remembering what century he was living in, he suddenly feared that he was coming across as a sexually aggressive male. ""I'm joking... yes, I'm single.""

""Do you always respond with humour when you're nervous?""

""Humour if I like the person - platonically speaking, of course. Otherwise... a complete shutdown of all social functioning.""

""I see. Have you ever been in love?""

""I fall in love all the time.""

""And how long does it usually last?""

""I believe my personal best is about six or seven weeks.""

""Why do you think that is?""

""I have little to offer women. I can make them laugh... sometimes. I can make them...""

""Orgasm?""

""...Sometimes. But women expect a lot more from a long-term relationship - understandably so,"" he felt the need to add. ""More generally, there's not really enough... 'me' to get attached to, if you see what I mean, which is obviously frustrating when someone's looking for... stability.""

""You make love sound like physics.""

""Isn't it?""

""Maybe,"" said Dr Sinha, appearing to latch onto this thought for a few seconds before continuing. ""Maybe six or seven weeks is more normal than you might think. Maybe the main difference with you is that you're not afraid of being alone.""

""And they call *me* cynical.""

""Are you?""

""...Sometimes... Maybe I'm afraid of not being alone?""

""Maybe. What about your other relationships? family? friends?""

""Well, my dad died fighting the Nazis, like his dad before him - grandad in north Africa in the 1940s, dad in North London in the 1980s. I was only a kid at the time, but he was never around much, so I barely noticed. The big C took the big M a few years back and I still miss her a lot. I've got an older brother in Amerika I haven't seen since the funeral, and not much at all in the last thirty-five years.""

""And friends?""

""They come and go.""

""Water under the bridge?""

""A lot of other stuff, too.""

""Do you like people, Joe?""

""This is starting to sound like my police interview - I'm not a misanthropist.""

""That's not what I asked.""

""Yes, I like people - most of them. Probably a lot more than they like me. Probably a lot more than most of them like most other people, from what I can gather. But... I like them the same way I like dogs and cats and elephants and whales and... well, you get the idea - I've never really felt like we're part of the same species. In fact, I recently did some research into my family history and it turns out that, while most people evolved from chimpanzees, I evolved from monkeys... it must be why I'm so cheeky."" K did manage to get smile out of her, this time.

""You're jokes are getting better.""

""Then I must be getting more nervous.""

""Then you must be getting to like me more - maybe as much as elephants.""

""I don't know, there's some pretty cool elephants about. That one on your shelf with the four arms, for a start.""

""That's my Ganesh. It's just a wee trinket from a market in Mumbai, of course, not like the bronze Broker has in his lounge - late Chola period he claims, but I find that hard to believe. So, is there anything else you want to tell me? anything that's bothering you?""

""Only the paranoid delusions."" K told her about the zephyrs and his recent fear of security cameras. She referred to this as 'hyper-vigilance', added it to his scopaphobia and general anxiety, sprinkled on the results of his cognitive assessment, and concluded was that he was suffering an acute stress reaction, brought on by his treatment at the hands of the police and exacerbated by an underlying neurodevelopmental disorder.

""You think I'm autistic?""

""No, I think you're nihilistic.""

""Ha! You're not the only one, a lot of people think that, but it's hardly a medical issue.""

""A lot of people think *that*, but they're wrong. It's not a philosophy, and it's not some juvenile, cry-for-help, pseudo-philosophical posturing, either. Nihilism has nothing to do with philosophy, but everything to do with neuroscience. I know you're not a parent, but are you aware of the stage in child development known as the 'terrible twos'?""

""Sure, it's when kids first discover their independence and start misbehaving, right?""

""That's the usual interpretation, but if you think about it, they've had the right to do whatever they want, whenever they want, since the day they were born - play and sleep, eat and drink, piss and shit. They haven't discovered independence, they've had their independence taken away from them. It's the parents who've changed... into dictators. What's really happening is a natural rebellion against the first attempts to install a belief system, but we all submit in the end. Growing up is a cycle of rebellion and submission, as we get bombarded with more and more information from our parents, from our family, from our friends, from our teachers, from our televisions... and from our tele*phones*, these days. This information is important for our development, but it's too much for the brain to absorb and remain healthy, it has to choose what to believe and what not to believe, and, more importantly, who to believe and who not to believe. The degree of autonomy one has in making these choices varies greatly, depending on the type of indoctrination practised in one's community, but we all make these choices... except nihilists. Nihilists lack the cognitive ability to make choices.""

""But I make choices all the time, wouldn't all those tests you gave me earlier have been a little bit pointless, otherwise? I chose to wear these clothes, I chose to have a cheese and onion sandwich for lunch, I chose to make a doctor's appointment... at least, I think I did... I'm sorry, I'm being trivial.""

""There's nothing trivial in a doctor's office, if it's important to you, it's important to me. And, besides, the evidence we're gathering suggests that even the wee choices, when made by nihilists, utilise different areas of the brain. But it's the big decisions, with real life, long term consequences that are the most interesting, the ones that require a significant leap of faith. Why have you never got married? or at least committed to a long-term relationship? or a long-term friendship? or a long-term job? or a long-term anything?""

""Commitment issues? You know, I thought I was doing fine until I suddenly wasn't doing fine, and now I find out I was never doing fine.""

""You're doing more than fine, you're doing great, considering. You've managed your condition by super-looping.""

""I'm super-loopy? I thought that kind of terminology was frowned upon, these days.""

""Super-loop*ing*. Let me explain. Looping and leaping are two distinct processes that our brains use to try to understand the world and our place in it. Looping uses rational thought to interpret reality, complete loops of reasoning and establish the truth of nature. Leaping uses creative thought to establish reality, complete leaps of faith and interpret the meaning of life. Both looping and leaping are healthy, beneficial cognitive abilities. Looping gives us science, technology, and a deeper understanding of the world, and leaping gives us art, religion, and a deeper understanding of ourselves. While most people learn to leap before they can walk, a lot less later learn to loop, and as long as leaping and looping keep out of each other's business, everything's fine - I'm not going to ask Ganesh how to treat a patient, for example. Non-loopers function perfectly well, too, as long as they don't super-leap. Super-leaping is attempting to leap what can only be looped - an epistemological understanding of objective reality. These days, super-leaping is on the rise because non-loopers are more suspicious, and less respectful, of experts than they were in the past. They're also on social media encouraging each other to super-leap. From what you've told me, you may have recently met a super-leaper, but - let me be clear about this - they're not usually dangerous. The only really dangerous super-leapers are powerful narcissists, like cult leaders and religious fundamentalists, who can manipulate and control other non-loopers. While super-leaping is a rare problem for non-loopers, super-looping is a common solution for non-leapers, like yourself. There are more leapers than loopers, and more leapers who are non-loopers than loopers who are non-leapers but there are less non-loopers who are super-leapers than non-leapers who are super-loopers. Super-looping is attempting to loop what can only be leaped - an ontological understanding of subjective reality. It's a way for you to artificially construct, as best you can, that which comes naturally to leapers, to rationalise an awareness of your own identity.""

""I think, therefore I am.""

""Exactly. Descartes was definitely a super-looper.""

""He was a drunken fart.""

""No, that's a super-pooper, but let's get back to you. There are two aspects of your condition that are relevant. Firstly, a neurological inability to engage with an irrational belief system. And secondly, an artificially constructed and insufficiently realised sense of awareness. Confronted with an experience which would have been traumatic to anyone, the sheer absurdity of the situation added, and continues to add, another layer of stress to a mind with a low capacity for self-identification. This has resulted in an acute stress reaction that, if untreated, could potentially develop into post-traumatic stress disorder. I'm going to give you some medication to help with the symptoms, and recommend you take it easy for a while. I'm also going to give you a doctor's note containing the full details of my diagnosis, which we've just discussed. I believe this will help you with your case and recommend that you at least give it to your lawyer. Anything else you wish to do with it is entirely at your discretion, you understand."" K wasn't sure if he understood anything any more, but his request for a written copy of that confusing consultation, so he could try to make sense of it on the bus-ride home, was denied for reasons of patient confidentiality. K knew there was little point in making the obvious point.

On his way through the waiting room, the original eight of the now ten impatient patients delivered a collective stare of contempt several magnitudes beyond what K had received when he'd been called into Dr Sinha's office over an hour before. He quickly made his escape before the old man could throw the *National Geographic* at him. K was very stressed by the news that he was even more stressed than he'd thought he was an hour ago. To make matters worse, a zephyr followed him into the centre of town, where hundreds of CCTV cameras seemed to be equally interested in tracking his movements. By the time he got off the bus, the zephyr-count had reached double figures and, surveying Malevich Square from the south-east entrance, he was relieved that there were none lurking outside any of the blocks. Of course, the rooftop cameras were all looking straight at him. He checked them again when he got to the North Block doorway and there was no doubt about it - they'd watched him walk across the square. In spite of all this, he was determined to tackle one of the smaller contributions to his anxiety at its source.

By the time he lost his nerve, he was outside Katie's door memorising his dual-apology, getting the words just right before he started to think of all the ways it could go wrong. He went to his flat and scrabbled some eggs. To make him less super-loopy, Dr Sinha had prescribed him leaping pills, which, she assured him, would also help with the stress and paranoia, so he took two with his coffee, before laying down on the couch to give that history of quantum mechanics another go. When it grew too dim to read, he got up to turn on the light and got a shock from the switch that killed the electricity in the lounge. When he stood on a stack of hardbacks to change the bulb, he realised the pills had made *him* too dim to read, but he was still too anxious to sleep, so he turned on the television. The regional news featured a segment about the upcoming by-election. Pearl Goolie was trailing in the polls behind Archie Johnson, who promised to uphold family values and continue the fine standard of representation our traditional community had enjoyed under Hogarth Stone. He also promised to uphold progressive values and improve the poor standard of representation our diverse community had endured under Hogarth Stone. Then he sent his best wishes to Hogarth Stone and his family at this difficult time. It occurred to K that ""under"" was the only word the candidate used that actually revealed anything about himself. After the news had finished, he channel-orbited around a poorly edited and tediously narrated Marx Brothers documentary that, nevertheless, contained enough archive material to put a smile on his face, until, during one of the ad breaks, he got pulled into an old B-movie called *Snafu Monkeys From Betelgeuse Five* that eventually sent him to sleep.",1,1740680956.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 33 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really messed me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That said I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. A humanist and a romantic.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve. Gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, it'd be nice to have some reciprocity. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be for something grander or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll help melt my heart =)

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, Modest Mouse, Provoker, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list - where would I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation. DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",2,1740680842.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1izmohn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1izmohn/i_cant_fucking_take_this_pain_anymore/,I can‚Äôt fucking take this pain anymore.,"My best friend who I‚Äôve been friends with for years stabbed me in the back. It‚Äôs a longer story, please take your time to read. I‚Äôm M14 if that helps. So in 5th grade, I met my best friend, let‚Äôs call him K. K was introverted and didn‚Äôt really have friends. But I thought he was a chill and nice guy, so I befriended him. We got best friends and met up really often and just talked about everything. Our friendship was really strong and we talked with eachother if we had a problem. Then, we came into 7th grade. At the beginning of 7th grade, mental problems came into my life. At that time, I had some friends, but never really close friends besides K. So, when the mental problems got worse, I got into the mental hospital and stayed there for 5 months. My other friends turned their back and didn‚Äôt talk to me while I was there, but K held the contact. I‚Äôm still thankful for that. After I got out, I thanked him very often and invited him to a theme park. We had a good time there, but anyways. Let‚Äôs fast forward to 8th grade, around December ‚Äò24. We talked a bit and suddenly, he asked me if I had a crush on someone from the class. I told him the truth and told him that I had a HUGE crush on a girl, let‚Äôs call her E. He told me ‚Äûaight‚Äú and said that he had a crush on another girl, but she‚Äôs not important for the story, so she doesn‚Äôt have a nickname. I knew that he had a crush on this girl for like 2 years, so it wasn‚Äôt a big suprise. 4 weeks later, we meet up. What does he tell me? That he has a crush on E. I was perplexed, so I just answered casual, like ‚Äû alright, cool‚Äú. I don‚Äôt even know why. I should‚Äôve confronted him. He knew exactly that I had a crush on her and still said that he had a crush on her and -even better- that he‚Äôll meet up with her two days later. I couldn‚Äôt believe it, but acted cool. So they met up (I was on vacation at that time) and he called me and told me how it was. Oh, btw, I forgot that, when we met up two days before, he asked MY MOM how to act around E. That mf. Anyways, he called me and it sounded ‚Äûaight‚Äú. Not really bad, but not very promising either. We met up as soon as I got back and he told me that he asked her if they could meet up again, but she‚Äôs said that she doesn‚Äôt have ANY TIME, which is obv a bad sign. I still had a huge crush on her. And idk if you know what I mean by huge crush. I mean, I wrote multiple short stories including her and 16 poems about her. Just so you know what I mean by huge crush. I got closer to her, we texted a bit, I invited her to my bday, she didn‚Äôt have time. So a few weeks later, I thought ‚ÄûIt‚Äôll kill mr if I don‚Äôt know what she thinks about me, so I‚Äôll ask‚Äú yeah, bad decision. I invited her to a coffee ALONE, but she rejected and said that she isn‚Äôt interested in me (she wrote it way nicer and wrote half a novel, but that was the main message). Alright, I thought, I‚Äôll get over it. Nope. Still thinking about her. My friend is distancing himself from me very fast. My current friends are stupid and childish. They are good to have fun with, but not to talk about my feelings or serious things. K doesn‚Äôt talk to anymore, and if he does, it‚Äôs just a hi (only if I say hi first btw) he‚Äôs such a simp. He only talks to her or friends he knows since half a year. Who befriended him when nobody was there for him, huh? You‚Äôre right. Me. He doesn‚Äôt talk to me. He sent me pictures of a ‚ÄûKarneval‚Äú (German tradition) party. He was there with E, her friends and some other friends I only know from sight. And no, that wasn‚Äôt a private house party, it was an open festival. And he never invited me. He never asked me if I had time. He never even mentioned it. And that‚Äôs where I am now. I‚Äôm thinking if he would even care if I just killed myself. Probably not. He only has eyes for the girl. Plus, he only sees her outside. He even told me. Plus plus, she‚Äôs not interested in him. When E rejected me, I asked what she thinks about K and she answered that she‚Äôs not interested in him. So his simping doesn‚Äôt help anybody. Atp, I‚Äôll just commit suicide. Nobody I care about cares about me. Not E, not K. Nobody. I have no one to talk to.",7,1740680790.0,SuicideWatch,3,0.9,False
1izmo9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1izmo9g/joe_k_part_10/,Joe K - Part 10,"K cautiously crept into Malevich Square like he was entering a war zone, checking every window in every block, and even the rooftops, expecting a toothless sniper to have him in his sights. That was when he noticed, for the first time, the CCTV cameras - one on the top of each block. How long have they been there? he wondered. The rest of the journey into town wasn't any less stressful. Every thin, hooded figure was a zephyr, intent on doing him some kind of harm - one on the walk to the bus stop, two on the bus, another one getting on the bus, another three on the walk to the surgery on Rembrandt Way. There wasn't any in the waiting room but that security camera was definitely looking right at him. It wasn't looking at the old man attempting to capture as much light as possible from the high window, to assist his reading of *National Geographic*, or the young woman in a pink baseball cap and matching headphones, filing each of her nails four times before repeating the routine, and watching a video on her crotch-balanced mobile phone, or the other young woman with her yellow pencil skirt riding up on the seat, exposing her flabby, fake-tanned thighs, as she failed to comfort a crying baby and thumbed her mobile phone, or the middle-aged woman in the hijab, picking invisible bits of fluff off her clothes and bilingually exchanging the latest gossip on her mobile phone, or the jelly-faced woman sneezing at her mobile phone, or the cream-faced woman in a low-cut top, leaning forward and eyeing the young man opposite over the rim of her mobile phone, or the young man opposite, enjoying the attention but doing his best to ignore it by keeping his own eyes rigidly fixed on his mobile phone, or the person of indeterminate age and indeterminate gender with an indeterminate tattoo on their neck, very determinately getting up, walking three times around the room, clockwise, while staring at the floor, and sitting back down. It wasn't looking at any of them, but they all looked at him with dismay and envious contempt when his name was called. He'd been waiting less than five minutes.

Dr Sinha was Scottish Asian woman in her mid-forties, with magnificent, large brown eyes, engaging enough to put even the most anxious of patients at ease. It turned out, she was a specialist in autism, Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders so, after a rudimentary physical examination, she proceeded to assess K's cognitive functioning. She tested his memory, concentration, attention to detail, decision making skills, problem-solving skills and emotional response to facial expressions, before finishing off with a standard empathy test. Then she asked him how he felt about the assessment.

""It was fun,"" he said. ""I'm already feeling better. Have you got any more?""

""You didn't feel that it was an invasion of privacy?""

""Not at all. I've had my privacy invaded a lot in recent weeks, and it's a refreshing change to be able to give my full consent.""

""Yes, Broker told me, it's a shame I never had the chance to meet you before the unfortunate circumstances of your arrest. It's a wee bit harder to get an accurate reading without any previous results to compare them with. May I ask you a few personal questions?""

""Well, if you're *that* determined to invade my privacy, I surrender.""

Non-loopers function perfectly well, too, as long as they don't super-leap. Super-leaping is attempting to leap what can only be looped - an epistemological understanding of objective reality. These days, super-leaping is on the rise because non-loopers are more suspicious, and less respectful, of experts than they were in the past. They're also on social media encouraging each other to super-leap. From what you've told me, you may have recently met a super-leaper, but - let me be clear about this - they're not usually dangerous. The only really dangerous super-leapers are powerful narcissists, like cult leaders and religious fundamentalists, who can manipulate and control other non-loopers. While super-leaping is a rare problem for non-loopers, super-looping is a common solution for non-leapers, like yourself. There are more leapers than loopers, and more leapers who are non-loopers than loopers who are non-leapers but there are less non-loopers who are super-leapers than non-leapers who are super-loopers. Super-looping is attempting to loop what can only be leaped - an ontological understanding of subjective reality. It's a way for you to artificially construct, as best you can, that which comes naturally to leapers, to rationalise an awareness of your own identity.""

""I think, therefore I am.""

""Exactly. Descartes was definitely a super-looper.""

""He was a drunken fart.""

""No, that's a super-pooper, but let's get back to you. There are two aspects of your condition that are relevant. Firstly, a neurological inability to engage with an irrational belief system. And secondly, an artificially constructed and insufficiently realised sense of awareness. Confronted with an experience which would have been traumatic to anyone, the sheer absurdity of the situation added, and continues to add, another layer of stress to a mind with a low capacity for self-identification. This has resulted in an acute stress reaction that, if untreated, could potentially develop into post-traumatic stress disorder. I'm going to give you some medication to help with the symptoms, and recommend you take it easy for a while. I'm also going to give you a doctor's note containing the full details of my diagnosis, which we've just discussed. I believe this will help you with your case and recommend that you at least give it to your lawyer. Anything else you wish to do with it is entirely at your discretion, you understand."" K wasn't sure if he understood anything any more, but his request for a written copy of that confusing consultation, so he could try to make sense of it on the bus-ride home, was denied for reasons of patient confidentiality. K knew there was little point in making the obvious point.

On his way through the waiting room, the original eight of the now ten impatient patients delivered a collective stare of contempt several magnitudes beyond what K had received when he'd been called into Dr Sinha's office over an hour before. He quickly made his escape before the old man could throw the *National Geographic* at him. K was very stressed by the news that he was even more stressed than he'd thought he was an hour ago. To make matters worse, a zephyr followed him into the centre of town, where hundreds of CCTV cameras seemed to be equally interested in tracking his movements. By the time he got off the bus, the zephyr-count had reached double figures and, surveying Malevich Square from the south-east entrance, he was relieved that there were none lurking outside any of the blocks. Of course, the rooftop cameras were all looking straight at him. He checked them again when he got to the North Block doorway and there was no doubt about it - they'd watched him walk across the square. In spite of all this, he was determined to tackle one of the smaller contributions to his anxiety at its source.

By the time he lost his nerve, he was outside Katie's door memorising his dual-apology, getting the words just right before he started to think of all the ways it could go wrong. He went to his flat and scrabbled some eggs. To make him less super-loopy, Dr Sinha had prescribed him leaping pills, which, she assured him, would also help with the stress and paranoia, so he took two with his coffee, before laying down on the couch to give that history of quantum mechanics another go. When it grew too dim to read, he got up to turn on the light and got a shock from the switch that killed the electricity in the lounge. When he stood on a stack of hardbacks to change the bulb, he realised the pills had made *him* too dim to read, but he was still too anxious to sleep, so he turned on the television. The regional news featured a segment about the upcoming by-election. Pearl Goolie was trailing in the polls behind Archie Johnson, who promised to uphold family values and continue the fine standard of representation our traditional community had enjoyed under Hogarth Stone. He also promised to uphold progressive values and improve the poor standard of representation our diverse community had endured under Hogarth Stone. Then he sent his best wishes to Hogarth Stone and his family at this difficult time. It occurred to K that ""under"" was the only word the candidate used that actually revealed anything about himself. After the news had finished, he channel-orbited around a poorly edited and tediously narrated Marx Brothers documentary that, nevertheless, contained enough archive material to put a smile on his face, until, during one of the ad breaks, he got pulled into an old B-movie called *Snafu Monkeys From Betelgeuse Five* that eventually sent him to sleep.",1,1740680774.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

I would be able to use coping skills and would actually help. I am a single mom, so I was in constant anxiety and would even keep myself and my daughter isolated due to this, but just recently I notice feeling like I could go to the park or store with her (defiantly something big for a change). Before I would not step foot in the gym due to huge anxiety, but last week I stepped foot there with ought any sort of anxiety, wow! I sat down on the kitchen table yesterday and actually read to my daughter and spent time with her with ought feeling irritated or tired. now life is not perfect, when I find myself getting triggered I do feel like I might loose control, but I am noticing changes right? Anyways, I noticed coffee is a no, no on this med. It makes you so dizzy. In the morning's after I would drink coffee I would get so dizzy until I would eat. So now I had to sacrifice coffee in the mornings. A tip would be to minimize coffee or drink it later during the day to not feel dizzy. At night I started to feel insomnia, so something that helped was rubbing alcoho, lavender with melatonin lotion on my feet, chest and temples (helped A TON). I noticed that I was much more aware of huge triggers which before I had no clue I had them.

  
Let me know how its been for you?

Any tips? Tips on triggers?

How to make the most of it?

Questions for me?

1izml1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1izml1f/hyper_focused_on_relationship_dynamics_does_this/,"Hyper focused on relationship dynamics, does this happen to you?","Today I'm struggling. A lot. I know one of the symptoms of CPTSD is to hyper focus on relationship dynamics, to mill around with the facts and try to problem solved/understand a relationship. My CPTSD is rooted in several areas of life, and originates from my relationship with my mom and has been reflected in romantic partnerships and one of two platonic friendships. As I age and connect with healing resources (therapy, yoga, meditation, breathing practices etc.), I have recognized characteristics in certain people and have managed to avoid the cycle to an extent.

That said, I am cousins with a woman that I have struggled to maintain a relationship with. Some days I wish we weren't friends at all and I could just be with my core friends. Other days I'm thankful for her. Recently, I've been feeling more the former than the latter. I admire the way she functions in the world, but as an observed also sees how she hurts those around her. I overthink and overthink and overthink and can't seem to let it go. I love her, and yet I ruminate. Here is an example scenario: we go for drinks. She gets a non-alcoholic drink, and I get a beer. Immediately she goes into a lengthy daitrab about how alcohol is poison, literal poison, for your body. That anyone who buys and consumes it is not only poisoning themselves but perpetuating the addiction in society. That it is contributing to our complacency, our obesity epidemic, and putting money in the pockets of those that are taking advantage of our societie's most vulnerable. Here's the thing, I don't necessarily disagree. I can see where she is coming from and this is where my mind starts to overthink and ruminate. 

She isnt necessarily wrong, but why subject me to this speech? It feels manipulative and demeaning. If I call her out, she has the starts to prove her point and she may mention that I am affected by the patriarchy, forgetting that women have a voice too and the only reason I felt bad was because I'm so used to giving into what society expects of us women - silence. Which she is also right, I agree. She used to incessantly call me, send me emails, and texts in this ""bold"" but also passive manner to change how I lived my life. So jump forward a year, she has been doing this to a lot of her friends and no one is changing their behavior. She now thinks alcohol is ok in moderation. That people can drink in moderation and she really misses the feeling. Please note she has done this same thing with meat, coffee, sugar etc. She has flipped on all of these thoughts after she finds an article or a doctor that tells her she can or ""should"". For instance, the coffee she added back in after she determined she had ADHD, so it's ok for her to have coffee because it's medicine. The meat she added back in because she went to 3-4 different gut doctors that eventually put her on a diet to recalibrate her gut biome. She is adding alcohol again because her friends were not following suit (no one cared that she quit) and she read that limited amounts can assist with lower anxiety as long as you don't become dependent on it as an anxiety oppressor. 

Anyway, point is I'm becoming critical of her. I'm ruminating and am angry and I dread having meet ups. I don't know if I will be with my cousin - the fun loving, joking around, open minded but strong willed warrior OR the cousin that feels manipulative, sort of lecturey, demeaning etc. 

Is it me? Is this CPTSD? Is it causing me to enjoy her some days and not others? Is my tolerance really high and then not? The more I feel like I'm healing and can voice my opinions, values, beliefs outside of her approval the more I feel like she feels less close. It feels like she never wants to hang out unless I'm suffering or she has a point to make. I just need to stop ruminating. It's like I'm addicted to figuring it out, to proving (to myself) that my perspective is REAL AND VALID. I'm losing empathy for her and I feel resentment/anger towards her. I hate it. 

Can you relate? How do you get out of this?

Only issue I dont have any.","Hello I am Male 19 and italian from switzerland, I wanna meet people to get a friend. or a friend group. I am not totally socially anxious, at least that's what I think. Convos don't flow super naturally but I can approach anyone really. Only problem I don't know where. I cant seem to find anyone on the same wavelength, and I just don't know where.



I can list the things I've already tried and the things I've realized that it wouldn't work:

1. Went to paid cooking class (only woman above 30)

2. I went to paid keyboard class (I produce for fun and wanted to learn midi keyboard, but sadly there were only 4 other people, and they were women above 40 at least)

3. Went to ""Meet new friends"" Meetup, sadly only foreigners who I couldn't really communicate that well cuz english isn't my strong suit. I just speak very slowly and its just not comfortable.

4. Went to Gym meetup group, it was very big, but again weirdly just older people, and only foreign aswell. 



(At this point I realized on meetup. com there only/mainly seem to be english speaking people, since the people that newly moved in from a different country are the ones having trouble getting friends, I felt extremely out of place even there, cuz they are were wondering what I'm doing there, when I am for the same city the meetup was in and not like them being not from here at all)

5. I then did a bouldering meetup that was pretty big aswell, also something that I do in my free time or did at least, I cant rn since I'm injured. But it didn't really go that well, convos just didn't flow and it was very superficial. And also mostly ppl older than me, youngest was a girl at 25. 

6. Honestly I'm tired of writing this. I did plenty more. Maybe one worth mentioning is again smth with music, there was a jam session for fl studio producers but again they were quite older than me. 

Okay so you can see a lot of times I mention that they are significantly older than me and I also realized that's an ""issue"" or just smth getting in my way. But then trying to think of smth I would not be able to think of anything I could do where younger people are, or at least like that its guaranteed.

Hopefully this does not get deleted thanks, and I hope we can maybe start a convo and you can give me suggestions.

¬†*(tl;dr ‚Äì super fun Week, visit* [*TacomaBeerWeek.com*](http://TacomaBeerWeek.com) *and support your community)*

¬†Wait, I hear you ask‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt we just do this?

Yep, we did. In August. Which is a busy time of year. So we asked breweries and venues when they need support the most, and what did they think about moving it to earlier in the year ‚Äì it was a resounding YES PLEASE. So we did. Even though we‚Äôve barely recovered from August.

¬†In 2025, this little Week that was founded in 2014 and has been managed by a super small volunteer team of 3 is now being managed by a slightly small team of 7.

¬†As of the time of this post, there‚Äôs:

* 48 events
* 30 locations in Tacoma, Gig Harbor, Puyallup, and Sumner (mostly Tacoma)
* 79 partners
* 4 official beer releases

¬†Let‚Äôs talk about the beer collabs, since collaboration is a key part of the Week:

* We paired **Jan Parker Cookery and Delightful Neighborhood Market with E9 Brewing Co** to produce ‚Äò**Bayanihan‚Äô**, made with calamansi fruit and named for the Filipino custom of community, cooperation, and unity. You can try it first at the prefunk on **Friday Feb 28 at E9 Taproom**, where Jan Parker will be serving up Filipino treats.
* **Communities for a Healthy Bay joined with Silver City Brewing** to create ‚Äò**Gose With The** **Flow**‚Äô, using regionally-renowned lemon balm and San Juan Island sea salt. Clean water is essential for everything we love: our health, our environment, and yes‚Äîeven our beer. This partnership is a celebration of that connection, with a portion of proceeds supporting CHB‚Äôs work to protect Commencement Bay and South Sound waterway. It releases **Saturday March 1 at Peaks and Pints** after we‚Äôve all done a beach cleanup between Les Davis Pier and Jack Hyde Park.
* **Lander Coffee** is home to a unique Guatemalan coffee, Nueva Montana ‚Äì one of the few places in the country it can be found.¬† Lander teamed up with Grit & Grain Podcast and Logan Brewing to brew **‚ÄòNo Bad Time‚Ä¶‚Äô**, a Cascadian Dark Ale (or Black IPA) to mimic all the flavors of the coffee‚Ä¶without any coffee added during the process. Launches **Wednesday March 5 at Peaks and Pints**, after a podcast in their side room (open to all) where they all chat about the process.¬†
* Some of you may recall the band **Amber Pacific** ‚Äì local punk-pop legends and Warped Tour veterans. They‚Äôre back with a new album after 10 years, and it turns out their guitarist is an award-winning home brewer. So we put them together with world-famous Georgetown Brewing and the result is **‚ÄòAll in Amber‚Äô**, a ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì amber ale. This will launch at a special gig at **Airport Tavern on Saturday 8 March**. You can hear more details on a recent Grit & Grain podcast. This concert is going to be so good.

¬†While the focus of the Week is beer, there‚Äôs also cider, kombucha, a beer and cheese tasting, glassblowing, concerts, art, beer can car derby, science fair, bingo, trivia, hot dog topping + homebrew competition, and SO MUCH MORE. Plus there‚Äôs family-friendly options.

¬†This is a long post, but I‚Äôd like to highlight two specific events.

¬†**‚ÄòUm‚Ä¶Actually!‚Äô** is a live game show hosted by Tacoma‚Äôs favorite beer darling Sean Jackson (ex-Parkway Tavern and current E9) and presented by Sierra Nevada Brewing. It was *a* HIT last year, and will be back at the **Blue Mouse Theater Thursday March 6.** Proceeds go to support Feed253. Anyone can play, anyone can win (you don‚Äôt have to know much about beer), and there‚Äôs fun prizes. We strongly recommend you purchase your tix in advance ‚Äì if only to help reassure our hosts that there will be an audience and therefore contestants. Seriously, this is a hilarious event.

¬†**‚ÄòCheers! A celebration of women and NB industry folk**‚Äô is‚Ä¶exactly that. **Parkway Tavern** has joined with Pink Boots Society to bring together women and non-binary folks in the brewing and music industry to throw a great party on **Saturday March 8.**

This Week makes a big, positive financial impact to venues, breweries, and small businesses. Please get out there and support our local community - whether you are new to beer, an experienced connoisseur, or love beer and want to find fun things to bring your non-beer-drinking friends along to, there's something for everyone.
