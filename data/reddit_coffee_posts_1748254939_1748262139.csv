It's the YoHealth app — it rewards you with crypto tokens for walking. I’ve been consistently withdrawing from it, nothing life-changing, but enough for some coffee money here and there.

You download the YoHealth app (Android and iOS). In the ""Friends"" section, there’s a referral field — you can enter a code (mine is 2250754, you can use it :) ) and get 10k bonus steps. From there, you just walk. The app tracks your steps, and once per day you need to claim them manually, don’t forget this part or you lose them Once you hit 160,000 steps, you can exchange them for 1 FTN token (around €3.90). You can also cash out through the Fastex exchange, or use Ortak where the threshold is a bit lower (145k steps).

You can also do side tasks like downloading an additional app for 50k steps or watching adds for 5k steps for a quicker start

Most hikers start in March and April. To be fair I’d only learned about the AT a month prior when I read Bill Bryson’s “A Walk in the Woods” and it took me 45 days to gather all the gear and learn enough to feel comfortable starting off on such a tremendous journey. Starting in May is fine if you’re a fast hiker. That’s what we did in 2024. We started late May and finished early September. But in 2016 I wasn’t a fast hiker. I averaged just 10 miles a day.

I’d “flipped up” to Maine in August from Harper’s Ferry and headed southbound because I knew I wouldn’t be able to reach Mt. Katahdin before it closed for the winter. I found a great group of other flip-floppers and southbounders who’d started late and we made our way south at a leisurely pace. I camped at almost every pond along the trail in Maine, some days hiking as little as 4 miles before setting up camp and floating out onto the pristine waters using my inflatable sleeping pad as a raft.

This dalliance with the good life put us way behind schedule and we ended up on-top of Mt. Washington during a snow-storm in late September. Mt. Washington is the deadliest mountain in the continental US with 150 known fatalities, due in large part to the extreme weather and easy accessibility of the summit. Mt. Washington is a perfect example of what happens when private interests are allowed to control and profit off of public lands.

There’s a train that climbs to the summit of the mountain. Completed in 1869 by Sylvester Marsh, “The Cogline” was the world's first mountain-climbing cog railway. The Mount Washington Auto Road, originally a carriage road built in the 1850s and later adapted for automobiles, is also a private toll road. The cog charges $95 per passenger. The toll-road charges $36 per passenger. In the summer the peak will see 5,000 visitors per day, most of them arriving via the train and road. The rocks at the summit of Mt. Washington are stained black from the soot of countless trips that the coal-burning cog train has made up and down the mountain since the 1800s. They’ve recently installed a bio-diesel train but still run the coal train once a day, which burns one ton of coal per trip.

New England was colonized and populated before the laws protecting our public lands were put in place. We hiked the Long Trail in addition to the AT thru-hike last year and every single 4k ft peak in Vermont on the Long Trail, save one had a private ski-resort at the top. Thru-hikers grumble about the “Appalachian Money Club” when they hike through the Whites because this is the only stretch of trail under the control of a private(non-profit) entity, whereas the rest of the 2,200 mile trail is controlled by public entities like USFS, BLM, and DOI.

For example the shelters and camping are free for the 2,200 mile trail except the stretch in the White Mountains controlled by the AMC. Here it costs between $15 and $50 for the camping and shelters. Often there’s simply not enough shelter space or campsites to go around.

It is my opinion that this is by design. This becomes very apparent when you take a look at Appalachian Mountain Club’s business model. They derive most of their revenue($46 million in 2023) from charging exorbitant fees for hikers to stay in their mountain cabins. For example, throughout the White Mountains there are 418 bunk beds available through the various huts; these huts were established by the AMC before protection on public lands were put in place and therefore the AMC holds a unique role where they are allowed to manage, and profit off of public land. There are less than 80 designated campsites through the same stretch along the AT. If you want a bunk at the hut it will cost $170/night. At peak season Lake of the Clouds is bringing in $350,000 per month of revenue. And they pay their hut employees $13.84/hr starting off. These employees have to hike up all of the food and supplies for their guests carrying packs that weigh 90 to 110lbs. In 2023 AMC’s CEO made $338,223.

These are the only campsites available if you want to camp in the presidential traverse around Mt. Washington. If you maxed out the capacity that’s only 14 tents sites. In 2024 we hiked the entire Presidential traverse, 26 miles with about 9,000ft of gain and loss so that we would have guaranteed places to camp. A massive day and I puked shortly after the summit of Washington; we got trail magic up there and I’d drank two cokes and eaten two sandwiches. Not a good idea when you’re trying to maintain a 3 mph pace in the presidential range. Slower hikers, which often means older hikers, are forced to pay for spaces in the huts because they simply can’t make the miles required.

The huts will allow hikers to “work for stay” but it is entirely at the discretion of the crew that’s working and often limited to only two hikers. It’s not uncommon for hikers to be kicked out of the huts into terrible storms. In 2024 I met three Amish brothers. The Schmidt brothers. They were finishing the last leg of the AT which they’d broken up into three big sections. They were incredibly strong and fast hikers and we kept passing each other during the presidential traverse and exchanged stories. It surprised me to learn how well traveled the brothers were. One liked to go deep-sea fishing in Florida and Hawaii, another had backpacked through Europe, and they were all avid outdoorsmen and backpackers.

The brothers wore a matching outfit of blue-jeans with suspenders, flannel shirts, and big straw hats. They each had the iconic “Shenandoah beard” and spoke with a peculiar accent that I’ve never heard before. Their outfits were an odd juxtaposition with their Osprey backpacks and otherwise very typical backpacking gear. They told me how two nights before they’d almost been kicked out of the Galehead hut during a severe thunderstorm. I vividly remember that storm, we’d tried to camp at Liberty Springs campsite but it was completely full by the time we arrived at 5pm. We had to hike up the mountain an additional mile and camped right underneath a “no camping” sign on the only flat piece of ground we could find. The weather was horrible. Cold rain, high winds, and lightning. I had to drag away big branches that the AMC had strewn about the ground in order to discourage camping.

That’s another of the AMC’s dirty tactics. They actively fill in any flat sites where people can “stealth camp”(camp without paying) by covering any campsites in branches and fallen trees. They do this under the guise of “protecting resources.” If they really cared about protecting resources they would build more tent platforms. They don’t do that because if people had more options to camp they wouldn’t pay $170/night for their huts. Anyway the night of that storm the Schmidt brothers were sheltering in Galehead hut and around 5pm the hut crew told them that they had to leave. Galehead hut sits above treeline at 3,800ft. Described by the AMC as “the most remote location in our White Mountains hut system, Galehead Hut offers access to soaring peaks and sublime waterfalls.”

The storm was at its peak when the crew was trying to kick out the three Amish brothers. Thunder and lightning were crashing outside. High winds were driving the rain into the walls and windows of the hut in torrential sheets. And the crew was telling the brothers that they needed to leave the hut now because they’re about to start serving dinner to the paying customers. When the brothers asked them where they were supposed to go, the hut crew told them that they could hike a few miles to get below tree-line and camp. Hike a few miles exposed to the full brunt of the storm above tree line, in driving winds, cold rain, and lightning.

Finally, after the brothers stood strong and said they weren’t going to risk their lives in the crazy weather the crew members relented and let them sleep on the floor, but only after they put the brothers to work cleaning out the bathrooms and kitchen. I posted this story on my Instagram and received dozens of similar stories from hikers recounting their own experience of getting kicked out into dangerous weather by hut crew. Think I’m exaggerating the danger? That same night, during that same storm, on August 22nd, 2024, a 72 year old man would die of exposure half a mile below the summit of Mt. Washington. A thru-hiker would discover his body the next day.

A triple-crowner, Rafiki, died in January of 2024. Rafiki got caught in a winter storm as he attempted a single day Pemi traverse in the White Mountains. He called for emergency services and continued to move into the night in an effort to stay warm and self-rescue. I learned from one of his good friends that Rafiki’s GPS tracker showed that he’d walked circles around one of the huts trying to find a way in, but wasn’t able to enter the hut. The huts are locked and sealed for the winter. If he’d been able to gain shelter inside the hut perhaps he could have survived. This is pure speculation on the part of Rafiki’s friends but not unreasonable.

Now I’m not being entirely fair to the AMC. They do maintain the trail in this section. They do provide educational opportunities and jobs in the outdoors, and they do a lot of work for conservation. I think their leadership(based out of Boston) is overpaid and out of touch. I think they clearly care more about maximizing revenue and thus they cater to rich patrons from Boston and the surrounding areas, rather than making the outdoors accessible for all. I think a public land agency would do a better job of managing that land.

I’ve hiked that stretch in 2016, 2022, and 2024 now. There are muddy areas in that stretch of trail which have boards to help hikers traverse them. The same boards which were rotted out in 2016 have still not been replaced by 2024. There are now user made trails around those sections which have killed the fragile bushes in the alpine zone because no hiker is going to wade into knee deep mud when they can walk around the puddle. Much of the trail in the White mountains desperately needs to be rerouted because the trail is worn down to bare bedrock. One section just south of Zealand hut is literally a stream whenever it rains because that’s the path of least resistance for the water. Hikers have made their own trails around this treacherous section. Rather than building new, safer trails, the AMC instead throws branches to cover the hiker-created trails to force people to use the unsafe stream “trail.”

The trail in Vermont and Maine, both maintained by volunteers, are in dramatically better condition than the trail in New Hampshire maintained by the AMC. Ask any thru-hiker. This is simply the truth. The rest of the AT is managed by public land agencies and it’s only in this section managed by the private AMC organization that hikers encounter these myriad problems. This is why I firmly stand against the privatization of public lands. The only people who benefit from privatization are the private individuals who own the land, the public inevitably pay a higher price for worse service.

The average nonprofit CEO compensation is $152,119, according to the Economic Research Institute. You would think that the CEO of an outdoors oriented non-profit wouldn’t make more than twice the national average, yet she does. $338,223. AMC’s CEO makes .73% of AMC’s entire revenue. To put this into comparison, the CEO of The New York And Presbyterian Hospital was paid $9.3 million in 2023, one of the highest paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. Yet that was only .09% of their revenue of 10.3 billion. So when you account for the relative sizes of the two non-profits the AMC CEO is paid eight times more than her counterpart if we equalized their revenue. The executive compensation is simply way out of line with other outdoor nonprofits. For example the CEO of the Montana Conservation Corps made $146,715 in 2023. Conservation Legacy, with a comparable revenue of $48.5 billion paid their CEO $180,030 in 2023.

**Appalachian Money Club.** The name is well deserved.

In 2016 we sheltered in “The Dungeon” at Lake of the Clouds hut. The dungeon is an emergency shelter built below the main hut. It’s a tiny room about 10’ by 10’ that has a stack of old wooden triple bunks. The walls are bare stone. It is meant to be an emergency shelter for hikers caught in the unpredictable weather on-top of Mt. Washington. There was a winter storm forecast and rather than risk getting caught out in it we chose to instead stay at the dungeon.

When we stayed there in 2016 it was free. Now the AMC charges you $10 per person for the privilege of escaping death. We ended up squeezing nine people into the tiny room. Six in the triple-stacked bunks and three on the floor. Bear, standing at an astounding 7’1” and weighing over 300lbs was one of the hikers on the floor.

Footage from Mt. Washington and The Dungeon in this short 1 min video:

I’m still inspired by Bear’s story. He started the trail weighing over 400lbs and it took him two days to hike the eight mile approach trail. He said he’d pick a tree, hike to it, then take a break. That was how he managed for the first weeks of the trail before he lost weight and got in better shape. By the time I met him he’d lost almost 100lbs. He said what drove him was the fact that he “wanted to be the kind of man who could finish such a challenge” and wanted to become an Army officer after the trail. I don’t think he ever became an Army officer but he did go on to become a counselor and social worker. Before starting the trail he’d been working in Chicago as a tow-truck driver and he was so intent on finishing the AT that he stopped making payments on his truck. He couldn’t afford to both hike and make his truck payments. His truck at home was repossessed when he was hiking through Vermont. Bear would go on to finish the trail and it took him almost nine months. In the end he lost 150lbs.

The night in The Dungeon was memorable and a lot of fun. I had a big bag of peanut M&Ms and we made a game of trying to throw the M&M’s into each other’s mouths. We stayed up late sharing ghost stories while the wind howled outside. So we benefited from the fact that Lake of the Clouds hut existed. It’s not all black and white. I’m sure the accessibility of the summit at Mt. Washington has allowed many more people to experience the incredible beauty of the mountain range, people who otherwise wouldn’t have the physical capacity to hike to the top. By this same token however the ease of accessibility has led to dozens of deaths of people who were unprepared for the conditions at the top of Washington.

I think overall public lands need to remain in public hands and be managed by public land agencies. I love thru-hiking because of the equality inherent in the wilderness. It doesn’t matter how much money you have, you still have to carry your own pack. Campsites and shelters are first come first serve. Money doesn’t buy you any extra privileges along the AT. Except in the White Mountains that are controlled by the AMC. Here, money does buy you extra privileges. Money buys you places to sleep where poor hikers have to continue on or beg for the opportunity to clean toilets in exchange for sleeping on the floor. Having the money to pay $170 for a bunk means you won’t be kicked out into a dangerous storm.

I don’t like that. I don’t want the outdoors to become any more of a pay to play system than it is. Even now the vast majority of thru-hikers are white(90% according to [halfwayanywhere.com](http://halfwayanywhere.com) surveys). Because it takes money and resources to buy gear and take six months off of work. Let’s not make it anymore expensive or inaccessible by privatizing public land.

# US Marshall’s Hold Hikers at Gunpoint

I’m reminded of Colin “Zen” Gooder. He ran Gooder Grove in Franklin, NC. I first met him in 2016 and would spend three nights at his hostel that year. Zen had just started it up after his mother had passed and left him her house the year before. He’d already filled the tree in his front-yard with the discarded shoes of hikers by the time I arrived in late May.

Zen picked me up along with three other hikers from the road in his beat-up Honda Civic and drove us into town. “What’s up dude, I’m Zen, nice to meet you.” Zen spoke like a California surfer dude. Very mellow. Very chill. Very much high on weed night and day. We arrived at his house, the lawn filled with a random mix of lawn gnomes and Buddha statues. “It’s all good guys, come on in. Welcome to Gooder Grove.”

Despite Zen’s trail name he was not very Zen. I found him to be quite chaotic, high-strung, and manic. Every morning he would fly through the house in a panic, searching for his keys and his coat, late to pick-up hikers, muttering under his breath the whole time. He liked to spend the nights getting super high with hikers and recounting far-out stories. About the only time I’d seen him truly calm was after he’d smoked two bowls.

He recounted to me a story of how he’d had a break with reality the year before when his dead father had visited him. I couldn’t ever quite figure out if this was a psychedelic experience, a dream, or just something that happened to him in his normal waking consciousness. Zen liked to pull out the Tao Te Ching and hold hikers verbally hostage as he read random passages from the book. In the years that passed Zen developed a controversial reputation on trail. Some hikers loved him and had great experiences. Many other hikers fought with him and got into verbal and physical confrontations with Zen and were unceremoniously booted from his hostel.

I think Zen suffered from mental health issues exacerbated by the fact that he wasn’t really equipped to run a hostel. This is a case where he would’ve done much better to charge a higher rate and run his hostel like a business. Zen had a good heart and couldn’t turn people away and couldn’t stomach the thought of overcharging for his services. Thus, he couldn’t ever really afford employees and his erratic behaviors drove off what few employees he did manage to hire.

Two weeks after I hiked on from Gooder Grove in 2016 I heard that the US Marshall’s raided the hostel. The Marshall’s held hikers at gunpoint while they arrested a felon who had absconded his probation. The felon had been hiding out at Gooder Grove pretending to be a hiker. I’d met him! He claimed his trail name was Pippin because he liked to smoke the pipe. We all got a weird vibe from Pippin and his story didn’t add up. His gear was a mishmash of random things that no thru-hiker would use, and he’d been staying at the hostel for over a month doing random jobs for Zen to pay for his bunk.

It turns out that Pippin was a convicted child molestor and had absconded his probation and left the state. He’d been found by the Marshalls because he’d used his cell phone to contact his ex. Truly, my friend Fritz from Montana was right. The worst crime any criminal ever commits is the crime of being stupid.

Zen would kidnap me off the trail in 2022 during my Calendar Year Triple Crown. He’d messaged me offering to let me stay in his hostel a week before, but I’d planned to skip Franklin. I didn’t need to stop there and wanted to keep making good time. I told him thanks for the offer but I’m just going to keep on hiking and I won’t stop until the NOC. So imagine my surprise when I saw Zen hiking toward me from a trailhead.

“Quadzilla! I was just following my gut intuition and it told me I’d see you here today! What’s up brother?!” Yeah, your gut intuition and my Facebook stories most likely. “Come into town with me!” Zen wouldn’t take no for an answer and basically kidnapped me into town that night. It wasn’t entirely unwelcome. It was February and it was still cold out so getting a shower and a warm bed was very welcome. It also happened to be my birthday. I turned 37 that day. Zen and I went out to get a Chinese buffet for dinner. I paid for our dinner and put some gas in his van. I knew Zen was always having money problems.

He’d expanded his hostel with more bunks since 2016 and now had a big 12 passenger van. He filled me in on all the drama he was currently embroiled in. The girl he’d hired for the summer just told him she wasn’t coming because people had sent her messages slandering him. He was fighting with the owners of a new hostel in Franklin. He sat me down and recorded a new video series he was starting. He wanted it to be like “Between Two Ferns” and interview hikers. “Ah, this is why he’d kidnapped me.” The owners of the new hostel in Franklin had started a similar series with the hikers coming through their doors.

Even though I was exhausted from hiking 128 miles in five days I sat up with Zen and we recorded his video. It wasn’t great. Here it is. He uploaded it to his YouTube:

You can see how tired I am. I’d been up since 6am that morning and hiked 26 miles that day.

The next morning I was anxious to get back to trail but Zen wasn’t to be rushed. He made coffee. He made some breakfast. He picked up his Tao Te Ching and read a passage to me. You can see Zen reading to me in my video blog about my CYTC here:

Finally Zen dropped me off on trail around 9am and I was off again. That would be the last time I’d ever seen Zen. He died 13 months later, on March 23, of 2023. His obituary just says that he passed unexpectedly. Zen was a flawed human, like we all are. His flaws just were out in the open for all to see because he invited hikers into the privacy of his home, whereas most of us hide our mental health struggles behind closed doors, Zen didn’t have that option. He was a good person at heart and meant well. I just wish he’d found more support for his mental health.

Lice Disease Diagnosis: Symptoms, Risks & Prevention | StoryHive07

A person who, in the desire to enlarge his penis, applies special medicines or poisonous insect repellents to his penis without permission, will develop eighteen types of diseases due to the aforementioned lice disease, such as - Sarsapika, Asthila, Granth, Kumbhika, Alji, Mridita, Samudhapitrika, Vandanamantha, Pushkarika, Sankhahani, Bekkka, Shataponka, Tvakapak, Shonitarbuda, Butanarbuda, Butanpak, Bidradh and Tilakalaka.



Sarsapika - Due to lice disease, white mustard-like pimples called Sarsapika appear on the penis. It is caused by the irritation of coffee and blood.



Asthila - Due to the presence of lice, hard pimples like Asthila (a cobbler's grinding stone) appear. Its ends are uneven and it is due to the influence of wind.



Grahthata - When the penis is covered with mucus, glandular pimples appear on it due to the influence of wind.



Kumbhika - Due to the influence of wind, blood and bile accumulate, producing black pimples like the shape of a seed.



Alji - This is described in the disease of dysentery.



Mridita - When the penis is swollen and diseased due to wind, swollen pimples appear especially due to the influence of wind.



Samudhapidala - When the penis is very painful due to wind.

TThis occurs due to the influence of wind

Due to the Abamachaka defect, innumerable long pimples are formed, the middle of these pimples becomes cracked. This causes pain and excitement to the patient.



Pushkarika - Its shape is like a lotus bud. Many small pimples appear around these pimples. It is blood and bile.



Tumblr  👈👈

Loss of touch - Due to contaminated bile, the blood becomes contaminated, causing loss of the sense of touch.



Bekkha - Due to bile defect, blood and bile become contaminated, resulting in the formation of red pimples in the shape of deer and berry.



Shataponka - Due to bile defect, air and blood become contaminated, producing many holes like sieves in the penis.



Tshikakapakka - In this, due to the outbreak of blood and bile, the upper skin of the penis becomes inflamed along with fever and inflammation.



Shintarbuda – In this, the penis is covered with black, round, and small, slightly bloody pimples, and the pimples cause severe pain.



Butuyasarbuda – The flesh is contaminated due to the fault of the suk.



Butuyasapak – If the flesh of the penis is cooked due to the fault of the suk, the pain of the three faults of the wind and wind is experienced.



Vidradh – The symptoms of a sajipati suk are seen in ether.



Tilakalaka – If poisonous suk of black or red color is applied, the entire penis is cooked and it turns black and falls off. This is a tri-doshaja.




Asadhyay sambhava – Among the diseases of the suk, butuyasarbuda, suk, vidradh and tilkalaka are impossible.

1kvsuh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1kvsuh7/how_to_actually_manifest_your_sp/,How to actually manifest your SP,"You've watched the countless YouTube videos, you've scrolled through TikTok like a manic. And it still feels like everyone is yapping about “try this technique”, or “do this for 60 days” or even worse “book a consultation with me $$$$”. You don’t need to spend money or time to manifest. You’re always manifesting, whether you know it or not. You can’t take breaks from it, it’s always happening. You’ve manifested reading this post. 

It’s just as easy to manifest an SP than it is to manifest a cup of coffee. Let’s dive deeper into that. All the manifestation books tell you to start off with manifesting a cup of coffee. Why? It requires very little energy. You sit and think of drinking coffee, forget about it, and later sometime someone will offer you coffee or ask you to get a coffee sometime. How did this happen? You entertained the thought, felt it as deep as possible then forgot about it. You didn’t second think it, you didn’t obsess over this coffee, you simply let the universe figure out the rest. 
This is no different to manifesting an SP. Why do some people manifest their SPs so effortlessly? Because it’s the same principle. The issue people have is they want to manifest their SPs obsessively which holds a lot of negative energy. You can’t manifest whilst being attached to your desire. Imagine you’re in a restaurant and the waiter (the universe) asks you what would you like? You give your order and then the waiter says “sure coming right up”. But then you say “wait! I just wanted to tell you again what I wanted”. And you don’t let the waiter go inform the chef of what you want so they can make it for you. When you do affirmations obsessively or weird techniques, believing in the 3D/4D nonsense - you aren’t giving the universe a chance to figure out the best way to bring your manifestation to you. You’re slowing down the entire process for no reason. This is why people get tricked out over letting go. Letting go doesn’t mean you don’t care anymore, it just means you don’t care about how the desire comes to you because you know you already have it. 

Now with an SP, I’d say people get very emotionally invested. Sometimes they want to manifest a crush or an ex back. Manifesting someone you have no history with is less tricky because you go into it with a fresh mind, but with an ex, you go into it with heartbreak, longing for the person, you kind of obsess over them in the worst ways. This alone doesn’t let you let go properly. The focus in both scenarios should be on you. You should be focusing on your own happiness and becoming a person your SP would want to be with. A lot of people are concerned about what their SP thinks of them, and gives off this emotional begging in a way. You have to make yourself that person that’s already with your SP. We’re all individuals, your SP is their own person as well. This is a good thing! Because imagine if you had to control everything your SP does or feels for you - that’s kind of what you’re doing when you’re manifesting them. Let go of control and just know. Know that the universe will bring you together in the best way. 

Before I end I want to share a funny manifesting story I encountered recently, that will show you how simple it is to shift into the state of your desire. I wanted to manifest closing on an important business deal for one of my restaurants, and I envisioned getting a call - now in my visualisation I heard my phone ring (like actually ring loud) and I picked up my phone and heard the good news. I waited and waited and couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting the call. I was laying on my couch one day and noticed I had my phone on silent that weekend. I switched silent mode off and within an hour my phone rang and it was indeed the business call. The message of this example of mine is that sometimes it’s better to spend time preparing fully for your manifestation. We can’t get what we want if we haven’t made the space or prepared properly for it. Prepare for your SP, become the person that your SP would be lucky to have. You’re doing them a favor by being with them. ",1,1748261672.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

1kvsh26,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1kvsh26/left_out/,Left out,"3 days back I was talking to a relative of mine and she told me that she’s dating a guy. She’s my age lets say on the early end of 20s and prepping For a few exams while also working.

talking about things she brought up the topic of dating which I don’t really bring up unless I just want it off my head after battling with it for long or when I’m exceptionally vulnerable I.e with my older sister Who’s a a surgeon and quite a big support structure in my life.

  
now about this cousin she started off the convo fine….hi hello how are and all and within 17 minutes she went to the topic of “are u seeing someone ?“

she very well knows that I am not the kinda of person who’d go out on dates or be interested in relationships anymore - had made it clear to a lot of people a few yrs ago when there was a family wedding and all that not even jokes about that particular thing are fine by my side. I’m just done…too tired to discuss too tired to explore. All I want is peace with myself and maybe some good books and a strong cup of coffee to have my day made. Yet a big chunk of those same people whenever they meet me or even talk to my parents always enquire about the same bullshit. Idk why but isn’t this a bit weird to do? Poke someone’s past just to know how it was….coz I voluntarily would never share anything knowing how shallow they are.

  
the cousin I was talking about has dated 15 men in last 5 yrs and slept with countless more and has once called me “bitchless “ in front of a few people. My dad had helped her land up at a really good job when she had quit and sat home saying she’s not interested, not understanding the kind of privilege that is. My dad never went to that extent even for me…like ever …and even after that I get such a treatment. 

this person I talk about grew up in a different city and came to Delhi for a period of 3 yrs in the same yr that I had shifted out of Delhi due to certain reasons. Now remind u I was brought up and born in Delhi and spent 15 yrs of my life there and she had the audacity to tell me that I’m not so “urban”.

i do not dress very showily. I have 7 sets of formals  black and white and I feel comfortable in them when I’m out. Somehow I’ve had this repeated bs come out of her mouth that “tum kitnay boring ho”…..like idk man..I’m comfortable but it hurts at times when I realise that maybe…I’m not like others…I rarely fit in…life has shown me such weird instances and bad structures of occurrences that I ended up being wholly pragmatic about things. 

I can crack jokes on things but I rarely laugh. I feel a bit….emotionally distanced from people in general and very low on the so called “happy hormone”. I want a group to get along with but I find a big lot in our gen going after things I never felt synchronous with. I’m not saying theyre superior or inferior but I just can’t relate to a lot of things.

  
the things I do relate with aren’t that common. Internationally politics economic analysis policy development coding a few movies and series yes…but it’s like…I get a kick out of anything mentally stimulating and people call me names coz of that and it sucks….like the other day a family friend told me “din bhar kitaabon k saath kya karta hai gym jaaya kar” which made me feel inferior. Left out.

its True that people with outgoing hobbies can actually show the results very easy and it is appreciated by society but then why am I being told something weird as if I’m an insect in a cave. I have dated in the past….it was all too chaotic…dates meet-ups, her friends my friends drama and constant emotional struggles I just dont end up fitting in…and it had started to catch up….there are points where I just wanna ..switch off idk..pull the plug to my system and be done.

  
theres millions of ideas and particular thoughts I have which I can direct no where. Share with no one coz….parents samajhte nahi…aage Peechay koi meaningful dost hain nahi…jinko janta hun woh BC party aur daaru mein interested hain…

  
I am a crossroads of where to employ  so many ideas without being….mocked around 

nahi pi paata yaar daaru… nahi hota mere se socialise nahi hota mere se outing aur road trip…thakaan ho jaati hai meko.  BC movie dekho usmen thakaan ho jaati hai..long drive toh I can hardly think of..even if it’s just being with people it makes me tired..and drowsy even…kahin toh hoga na jahan fit in karun…

I’m happily married with two kids (7 and 10), and I love my wife deeply. I handle most of the laundry, weekly cleaning, cooking, and changing bed sheets, while we split grocery shopping and dropping off/picking up the kids fairly evenly, depending on our schedules. My wife takes care of most school-related tasks, like reading newsletters and communicating with teachers. We also both support each other in doing separate activities, like hobbies or outings, and encourage each other to have that space.

I try to do something nice for her every day, like setting out her breakfast, making coffee, or offering tea in the evening. I give her hugs and kisses, tell her I love her every morning and night, and sometimes surprise her with her favorite food or offer a back massage or foot soak. These massages usually last 20-60 minutes, and I do them to make her feel loved, regardless of my own mood. We always talk during dinner about our day, plans, or anything on our minds. Occasionally, I plan special date nights like a musical, dinner, and a hotel stay, though I’d love to do this more often. I also try at-home date nights, but I feel they don’t always turn out great, though we sometimes have really good conversations.

The issue is that we have different desires when it comes to intimacy. I’d like us to be intimate 1-2 times a week, but I’m always the one initiating, and sometimes months can pass between intimate moments. If she’s not in the mood for sex, I feel she could still meet my needs in other ways. When we last discussed this, she said she needs to be in the right mood to satisfy me, and it’s not something she can just do. I struggle to accept this because, for example, when I give her a massage, I don’t do it because I’m in the mood—I do it to make her happy, no matter how I feel. It feels unfair that she can’t give me 10-15 minutes a week to meet my needs in some way if she’s not in the mood for sex. Am I being unreasonable or selfish for feeling this way? I’d really appreciate your thoughts to help me see if I’m approaching this wrong.

**TL;DR:** I’m happily married, do a lot at home, and try to make my wife feel loved daily, but we have different intimacy needs. I want intimacy 1-2 times a week, but I always initiate, and months can pass without it.

we’re actually using that as an evening to trial the area, as my partner is currently waiting to hear back on a job that would have him based out of gatwick. he’s keen on closer to london living, but i’m leaning more towards somewhere like reigate with an option to be in london nice and quick.

we live in manchester now, so i’m not looking to get away from any kind of hustle and bustle, but for me london is a big jump even from MCR and i don’t particularly want to go headfirst into the thick of it and find it’s too busy etc. i’m from sussex myself, so i definitely value having country pubs, but of green space (we have a car also) and things like that, and i’ve still found manchester to tick all my boxes because you can still definitely find pubs that feel cosy like they do down south - but my boyfriend is worried that reigate is too ‘sleepy’.

we’re a young couple (early/mid-20’s), we like good coffee shops, a wine bar or a couple of nicer options for fancier evenings out, anywhere that does some good brunch (or that i could comfortably hang out for the day in working), and we’re big foodies and love going to restaurants whenever we can. i know manchester is not at all like anywhere in surrey, we’re not looking for a carbon copy, but somewhere that has a little walkable village with enough atmosphere, ticks off your morning in a coffee shop or getting brunch, a decent local pub with good food or a sunday lunch, and of course the fact that we can be on the train and into london to see friends and socialise whenever we like.

## The Magic of Quality Ingredients

When making the Easy Swiss Gipfeli Recipe, the ingredients you choose will make all the difference. Using high-quality products elevates the flavors and texture of your pastries. Here’s what to keep in mind:

- **Flour:** Opt for a good-grade all-purpose flour. It lays the foundation for that perfect texture.
- **Butter:** Go for fresh, unsalted butter. This is the richness that provides that signature flakiness.
- **Yeast:** If you’re using yeast, fresh is better. It’s the key to achieving that airy lift.
- **Milk:** Use whole milk for a creamier taste.

Choosing the right ingredients for the Easy Swiss Gipfeli Recipe isn’t just about flavor; it’s about creating a moment of joy when you take that first bite!

## Achieving Perfect Texture

- **Resting Time**: Allow the dough to rest adequately. This step is crucial for allowing the gluten to relax.
- **Folding**: The folding technique helps create those irresistible layers in your pastry.
- **Baking**: Pay careful attention to your bake time and temperature. A hot oven will help achieve that beautiful golden color.

I’m a 27 year old recovery alcoholic/ addict and have had extreme tiredness/ fatigue for many years. I thought the drinking/ drugging was the cause but I’ve been sober 18 months and the symptoms have persisted.

I can’t get out of bed, am sleeping during the day and have no energy- I have to drink tonnes of coffee/ energy drinks to perform daily tasks/ get out of bed. I have awful brain fog and everything feels like a blur

My ferretin is 600 and my transferrin saturation is 90%.

My doctor did extensive blood/liver tests and everything else is normal so haemochromatosis is looking like the cause. However she said it’s rare that haemochromatosis would make me feel this ill with the iron levels where they are.  

I am waiting for my genetic tests to come back this week and I don’t know what to do with myself.

Have others experiences similar symptoms as a results of haemochromatosis? If so, how soon did you start to feel better after the venesections? And what frequency did you have the vensections?

Any help/ advice would be greatly appreciated as I’m starting to lose my mind with how bad I feel all the time.

I think about the future, about the tender shoots of peace and kindness I wish to nurture not just in myself but in the world around me. As I tend to my small balcony garden, watering the daisies and herbs, I reflect on how these tiny acts parallel the effort needed in life's personal growth. Each drop of water is like an intention set, a promise made to the universe of what I hope to cultivate within.

It's not always easy, some seeds take their time... some get washed away by unexpected rains. But then, when a new bud appears, it's a reminder that persistence bears fruit, often in the most wonderful and unexpected ways. 🌼

1kvs60p,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1kvs60p/another_shimanami_kaido_review/,Another Shimanami Kaido Review,"Hey all - I just did the Kaido yesterday, legs fresh from hell and all. I did 80% of the total journey in about 9 hours, traveling from Imabari Station to Habu Port in Innoshima so I could take the ferry back. I thought I’d give some quick advice regarding the whole thing:

- I know this is the most common advice, but try to split it into at least two days if you’re planning to do any sightseeing, buying souvenirs, etc. You can do the basic route in one day, but it won’t be as much fun.
- If you’re gonna do it in one day, I advise to a) schedule your rental pickup and b) be there at the pickup point before 8:00am. Reservations are prioritised over walk ins, and I got there at 7:55, but since there’s only 1-2 people doing registration and another 1-2 doing the actual bike handover (inluding adjusting height) I wasn’t done until 9:00
- Keep your plans flexible to make way for rain - the entire weekend was predicted to be rainy, changed to cloudy on the last minute. The entire ride was fine but if you’re doing any photography the cloudy weather is kinda shit for it. I was ready to do something else if the rain was going to be too much. 
- Try to actually train with a bike: I had been running 40km a week for a couple months prior but yesterday wrecked me. I hadn’t taken into account the slopes to the observatories and up the bridges. 
- Be mindful of your route: don’t add too many observatories because those are guaranteed uphill. The Kirosan Observatory took me an entire hour to ride the 3km incline, because I had just done the incline to Kurushima Strait and then up to the first bridge.
- Similarly, do your research and verify whether your stop is something that might be worth going out of the way for. The Rose Gardens weren’t much, and I had to bike an extra 5km for it lol…
- Bring clothes for various weather types - I had layered on since it was a chilly day, but needed to remove everything by the end due to exertion. I wore trousers instead of shorts and that was mostly ok, but they were outdoorsy trousers. 
- Try to grab food where you can, because there are entire stretches where you won’t be able to find anything open. I had skipped breakfast and was short on time so I was fueled by protein shakes, coffees, and various crap instead of actual food which made the ride even harder. This also applies for bathrooms, I skipped a toilet break and suffered for it. 
- No shame in pausing, even for just five minutes! When I was having a hard time, I would take a break, and power through longer stretches after.  I had stretches where I biked five minutes and paused another five lol. I even walked with my bike at a certain point because it was easier. 
- Try not to bike under low hanging tree branches, because there are some spiders and itchy looking caterpillars just waiting lol
- And try to stay at a hotel where you’ll end your trip - having to take the ferry to Imabari, Shinkansen to Matsuyama, then tram to hotel was… not it for me
- One more thing: the locals will lie to you about how far your destination is. When I was in Omishima, they said Habu Port was an hour away. They also said that in different parts of Ikuchi lol. 

I know I sound like I had a miserable time, but it was actually the opposite! I wish I had done things better but it is what it is. 

Some recommendations:
- I really enjoyed my stops at Limone, Indigo Cafe, and Shimanami Coffee at Omishima Island
- I took the top route at Ikuchi even if it takes longer, because the coast was very nice to bike along. It’s also a relatively flat road so it was easy to cover the needed distance. There’s a cafe there called Little Kitchen that I heard was good, but was unfortunately closed yesterday. I also bought some lemon honey from some random cart, the location is hard to point out because she doesn’t have a pin and she’s literally right under a huge tree. 
- If you want to do lots of uphill, a battery assisted bike might be of use.
- Whatever time I lacked going upwards, I had to make time for it on flat roads and going downwards. Oshima was ridiculously hard, but the succeeding three islands are relatively flat or downhill except for going up the bridges. You might not have the same luxury coming from Onomichi. 
- wear some padding. I didn’t and I feel like my ass has gone flat entirely lol
- and make sure your next travel day is a chill day, I had a tough time walking today. ",1,1748259394.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Already adjusted my opv, a naked portafilter to improve my diagnostic, a WDT and a proper tamper to improve my workflow. I was thinking about investing into a new grinder to get the most of my specialty coffee. I can dedicate my built in Fred for decaf, that I only make milk drinks with anyway. A new electric grinder seems like an overkill in terms of price and footprint. So I thought a hand grinder would be the best bang for buck I could get, as I intend to limit my caffeine consumption. I've heard amazing things about the kinu m47, as I prefer rather traditional espresso for the most part. But paying 350€ for the m47 classic, which I prefer due to higher quality durable materials in comparison to the budget versions (the phoenix and rebel) is out of reach for me. I've also heard a lot of good things about the 1zpresso J ultra which is made out of higher quality materials than an m47 pheonix at the same price range, and honestly is more appealing in terms of looks.

And logically, I totally understand. If you’re drinking straight espresso I understand that slight lower quality can change the perception of taste.

However I like to drink latte or cappuccino with cinnamon and sometimes chocolate dusted on top

And I was wondering if this logic still applies? Or would the cinnamon and chocolate do a good job masking the lower quality machine fault? If so to what extent? Thanks

Edit: example say I make a mocha using a budget equipment vs expensive equipment. Would I notice less quality difference since it’s not inherently just espresso I’ve added sugar and chocolate flavoring. Would it mask some bitter uneven extraction produced by the cheaper machine.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",0,1748259193.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

✅ **Bug fix**: A minor logic issue was resolved that affected the gameplay tracking.  
🎨 **UI upgrades**:  
– Cleaner color palette (thanks to Reddit feedback!)  
– Better number highlighting for clarity  
– A more polished responsive layout for both desktop and mobile  
🧭 **Navigation improvements**: Added a proper 404 page and refined the loading behavior  
☕️ **Donation support**: Added a subtle “Support Us” page linking to my Buy Me a Coffee  
📈 **Analytics**: Basic Google Analytics integration to track engagement

💬 One user on Reddit said:

“I’m not a Sudoku enthusiast and I still finished a game with one mistake. It feels intuitive, well-made, and the mistake counter is a nice touch.”

This app is still a work-in-progress, and I’m planning a few small content/blog additions next.

Review: ""Formless Futures at Richter"" by Dr. Heather Sandra Wigston
For Uncharted Magazine

There is an art to improvisation. As any seasoned performer will attest, the best improvisations are rarely spontaneous in the chaotic sense, but emerge from a deep reservoir of structure, study, and foresight. Unfortunately, this truth was absent at last Friday’s event at the 'Richter' venue, where a quartet of beanie-hatted hopefuls attempted to summon meaning from an array of modular synthesizers with little more than knitted brows and a hope for serendipity.

The scene was familiar: exposed brickwork, pendant lighting, and the cultivated aesthetic of industrial authenticity. The performers—two men and two women, indistinguishable in their denim and thrift-shop layers—fiddled and patched cables as if summoning spirits from the void. But the only thing evoked was confusion.

The performance was, in a word, formless. Not in the radical sense championed by Xenakis or the intuitive spirit of Pauline Oliveros, but in a way that betrayed a fundamental lack of compositional knowledge. Tones meandered without purpose. Drones stacked upon drones until the air was thick with sonic mud. No thematic development, no structural contour—just the flat, insistent insistence that presence alone could justify art.

The audience, predictably, responded with the performative reverence now typical of such gatherings: chins were stroked, phrases like “textural depth” muttered over half-pints of saison. One might mistake this for genuine appreciation were it not for the unmistakable air of collective imposture.

This is not to suggest that modular synthesis lacks potential—far from it. I have dedicated many years to the exploration of its timbral range, often employing partially improvised methods myself at the 'Fahrenheit' coffee shop and during lecture-recitals at Fenland University College. But every gesture I make, every patch I configure, emerges from studied intent. There is always a spine, a logic, a reason.

'Richter' may yet find its footing. But until then, one hopes that the performers will step back, pick up a score, study a mode, and perhaps listen—truly listen—to the difference between noise and music.

1kvrx9j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kvrx9j,"Madoka no Mori (Hakone, Japan) Review","We stayed at Madoka no Mori, a 20-room luxury ryokan in the Gora area of Hakone, and I wanted to share a review because we really enjoyed our experience. Madoka no Mori is a place for quiet, understated luxury. It's not flashy at all - just calm, serene, and thoughtful. It’s ideal for couples looking to slow down and experience something peaceful and restorative. Between the fantastic food, the private onsen, the tranquil nature setting, and the great service, it was a very memorable stay.

Property - 8.5/10
Madoka no Mori is in the Gora area of Hakone, in between the Gora and Souzen stations. The property has a beautifully maintained garden, and it makes you feel like you’re tucked away in your own little world. The main lobby/reception area is a highlight; it has large windows that let in soft natural light and open up to views of the garden outside. We ended up lingering there more than once with tea or coffee, just enjoying the calm.

As soon as you step inside the property, you’re asked to remove your shoes (the entire interior is tatami flooring), and the mood shifts. It’s hushed, serene, and respectful. Guests and staff all speak quietly, and there’s this shared sense that you don’t want to disturb the stillness. It’s luxury, but in a deeply Japanese, restrained kind of way. There's natural wood used everywhere throughout the property, keeping the atmosphere warm and comforting.

When we arrived, we were welcomed with a choice of beverage and a confectionary snack, and also introduced to our room attendant, who was dedicated to us during our stay. The room attendant helped coordinate any arrangements such as driver pick-ups, and also served all of our meals.

As a traditional ryokan, there are limited amenities, e.g. no gym or restaurant on the premises.

Room - 9/10
We stayed in one of the suites, which came with a private onsen (hot spring) bath on an outdoor terrace, as well as a dedicated dining area. Price was ~$1000/night for 2 guests. All rooms have their own private bath, but there's also a public bath available that's segregated by gender. The room itself was minimalist but warm, with thoughtful details and beautiful natural materials. These are all traditional style Japanese rooms. Our suite had an open layout, but where the rooms can be sectioned off with traditional shoji sliding screens. We had a beautiful view of the forest and mountains.

The bed was incredibly soft and plush, which surprised us as we were expecting firm futons. Sleep was relaxed and comfortable every night. Soaking in the hot bath on the terrace, overlooking the trees and listening to the sounds of nature, was an unforgettable part of the experience. This was a great place to slow down and do nothing. There are some parts of the room that are showing a bit of age, such as the shower and bathroom fixtures.

Food - 9.5/10
As typical for ryokans, our room included breakfast and dinner as a part of the package. We opted for in-room dining since we had the option with our suite. The food was kaiseki style and was excellent - carefully prepared, seasonal, and beautifully plated. We were served 9 courses for dinner, which were all enjoyable. One of the standout dishes was a rich, comforting nabe soup, packed with flavor and served piping hot. Kaiseki is all about excellent, seasonal ingredients prepared simply, and they did it very well. If you haven't had traditional Japanese food, be aware that you'll be served some food with textures you might not be familiar with.

If you’re travelling as a group, they also have private dining rooms outside the guest rooms, which looked great for larger parties.

Breakfast was classic Japanese and very satisfying. Grilled fish, miso soup, salad, tofu, rice, and lots of small seasonal sides.

These meals are huge, so expect to be very full! I quickly learned to not attempt to finish off every dish to give myself a fighting chance of actually trying all of the dishes.

Service - 9/10
The service was excellent, but in a very traditional Japanese style. Very quiet, with intense focus on details, and with every movement feeling practiced and honed. The staff does everything they can to make sure your needs are provided. We returned one afternoon when it was raining. Even though the walk from the shuttle drop-off to the lobby was maybe 15 feet, staff were waiting with umbrellas to walk us in so we wouldn’t get wet. Just one of many quiet, considerate touches throughout our stay.

One thing to note is that most staff only speak basic English. It wasn’t a problem for us, and they always tried their best to help. If needed, they’d bring over a team member with stronger English skills. It never felt like an issue, but just something to be aware of if you’re not comfortable with basic Japanese or gestures.

They also offer a complementary driver service around the Gora area, which we used to get picked up and dropped off to the train station, as well as visiting different sights around the Gora area. It made getting around super easy.",9,1748258539.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

Here are a couple other factors - 

* Don't want to go over $800 a night (prefer to be closer to $600 but will splurge for a great room)
* Would love if there was easy access to coffee and quick bites (especially workday lunch)
* Must have a great bath tub
* Would prefer a hotel we have not stayed (Previous stays - Bellagio, Palazzo, NYNY)
* Doesn't have to be on strip but it would be nice

Could you share how wide the grind size range is for you between choking a shot and having it run way too fast (e.g., under 15 seconds for a shot)?

I’ve been struggling with my df54 for quite some time and have already aligned the burrs, among other tweaks, to rule out any mechanical issues. Still, the range between choking and a gusher seems extremely narrow, and I’m wondering if that’s normal for this grinder or if I might be missing something. I also feel like this wasn’t the case when I got it about a year ago.

For example, with my current beans, the usable range seems to fall between just 21 and 23 on the dial. At 21 the shot completely chokes, while at 23 I get a fast, spraying mess 

I understand this can vary depending on the coffee, dose, and machine, but I’d really appreciate hearing what kind of range others are seeing with their DF54s.

So, as the title says, the plunger broke after just under 3 months (got it at Feb 28th) of daily used, rarely more than once.   
Costumer service was really nice and immediately sent a ""free"" spare part as covered by the warranty.  Problem is, it still is 32$ shipment to the Czech Republic, where I live. 

The GO Felt kind of cheap made to begin with, and as much as I am happy about the coffee it yields, wear and tear in that short period of time is absurd.   
Moreover, their outrageous shipment costs make me regret going for the GO at all, and looking back on it, I would go with something else such as the ROK or the Cafelat robot (I have my own reason as to why those fit my better than other Flair models).

I'm not a doctor, just a regular guy in my late 30s living in Vietnam. Three months ago, during a routine check-up, I was told that my blood pressure was *consistently high*: around **150/95 mmHg**. Not yet crisis level, but definitely not safe either.

The doctor suggested lifestyle changes first, and we agreed to postpone medication unless things got worse. What followed was a 3-month experiment in self-awareness, daily habits, and a surprisingly emotional connection to... a blood pressure monitor.

# 📊 What I did (and didn’t do):

1. **I bought a mid-range arm blood pressure monitor (Microlife)** → I committed to checking my BP every morning and evening, sitting still, same position, no coffee beforehand. Logged every reading.
2. **I didn’t take any meds** → I wanted to try lifestyle changes first — with full transparency and tracking.
3. **I walked 30–40 minutes a day** → Nothing crazy. Just consistent, early evening walks around the neighborhood.
4. **Reduced salt & processed food (but not obsessively)** → I still ate phở and bún chả — just less often, and with less broth.
5. **Cut coffee to 1 small cup/day** → This was tough. But I switched to lighter roast and drank it after food.
6. **Took magnesium and omega-3 supplements (optional)** → Not sure how much these helped, but I noted better sleep and slightly lower morning readings.

# 📉 Results after 3 months:

* From **150/95** to **125–130/85** on most days
* Morning readings became more stable
* Resting heart rate dropped slightly too
* More importantly: **I felt more in control** of my body and mood

# 💡 Lessons I learned:

* The act of **measuring regularly** changed everything — I became aware of how sleep, stress, and food affected me day-to-day.
* I stopped blaming random symptoms and started **seeing patterns.**
* Not all improvements come from cutting things — sometimes, **adding calmness** is the best medicine.

This isn’t medical advice, but if you're like me — borderline hypertensive, but not in emergency range — I encourage you to try self-monitoring seriously. It’s a small daily act that gave me huge peace of mind.

If anyone’s gone through something similar, I’d love to hear your story too.

Alex and Dominic shot the shit while they waited on the bodysuits to finish. These were complex pieces of equipment, doing most of the heavy lifting of keeping the human inside alive and comfortable while also being several times more durable than that same squishy bag of meat and calcium it was wrapped around. It also housed a lot of electronics that benefitted from staying intact.

Each one was tailored to their specific user, and assembled in a printer that looked a lot like a full mediboard, despite having no biological components. It did have to fit something nearly the same size as a Human. Only took about an hour. The armor layer that went over it - very lightweight in the case of an environment suit - needed less customization.

“I mean - they seem friendly, right? First contact went down great, all things considered, but I don’t think they really wanted anything to do with us.” The conversation had eventually come around to The Aliens, as was somewhat inevitable. Dominic - also employed by ONI Section 7 as a SIGINT analyst specialized in collection and exotic computer systems - was unsure what to make of them.

“So far the ones I’ve met have mostly been friendly, or indifferent. I was a guest, of course, so that could have something to do with it.” There were one or two that were more than friendly. Murderous ones too, can’t forget those. Neither of those groups would get mentioned for now. “We had a pretty cool start, sure. Humanity was the trespasser, but once we got things hammered out, we didn’t have much to offer each other. We were both reasonably advanced, space faring races that weren’t hurting for anything at the time. We’ve done some materials trading over the years, but that’s about it.”

The first treaty had been signed more than sixty years ago, and the trip from the edge of the Confed’s frontier at New Austin to Schoen was nearly a full month on the fastest ship available at the time. The Tsla’o had been happy with their little Empire, expanding slowly and deliberately, in juxtaposition with the Human tendency to throw down roots *wherever*. Comfortable? Great. Too cold? We’ll bundle up. Toxic, boiling hot atmosphere? That’s what tunnels are for.

“Not even mediboards? That seems like a slam dunk.” Dominic was right there, to a certain extent. All the medical personnel aboard the *Sword* had been excited to get their hands on it.

“Mediboards weren’t a thing when the original treaty was signed. They’ve only been out for thirty years.” Sometimes Alex felt like a fountain of useless information, but it had come in handy every week in college once he found a good team for trivia night at the Rust Bucket. “And you can’t forget how much of a shitshow the first generation was. Marston’s disease and all that. Imagine being like, hey here’s this great technology we’d like to sell you, and burying the lede about it giving people super cancer sometimes. Not doing *any* business after that, at best.”

“Wh- hang on, *that’s* what Marston’s is?” That information was news to Agent Crenshaw, voice dripping with horror as he leaned in. He wasn’t too much older than Alex, so they would have both been children when the first gen was having teething problems. “I thought it was like- Like organ rejection.”

Honestly that wasn’t a lot better, but it *was* better than Marston’s. “No, early boards used a synthetic cell that just didn’t go through differentiation right sometimes. Some kind of stem and cancer cell hybrid, it usually did cancer stuff when left to its own devices, but sometimes you got the bonus of growing random things in places they didn’t belong. Didn’t you ever see the teeth picture?”

There was no way in any of the hells that the Tsla’o would have wanted mediboard technology when it involved cells that used some DNA from cancer.

“*No*. What the hell is the teeth picture?”

“Ooh, lucky. I cannot stress this enough: *do not* look it up.” Seriously, don’t look it up.

“The Marston’s teeth picture? He is right, do not look that up.” They had been engrossed in this conversation deeply enough that neither of them noticed a third person coming down the bay. He had a terse British accent, neatly parted blond hair and gray eyes. Looked like the most professional person in the entire depot, wearing brown slacks and a button down shirt. “There’s a video too. A most unsettling thing to behold.”

Dominic’s head whipped around, startled by this sudden interjection. “Fuck, man- The hell’d you come from?”

“Cambridge.” He looked just as smug as could be when he said it.

Alex was a bit more used to surprises, apparently. “The city or the university?”

“University. I hail from Uttoxeter.”

The Martian was at a loss, shaking his head. “Never heard of that, what planet is it on?”

“It’s in England.” He said it like he’d never had someone assume he was born off Earth before, let alone outside of the UK.

“*Where* in England?” Alex had visited London for a few days once after getting bounced from the Scoutship program, before backpacking through a good chunk of the rest of Europe. He hadn’t found enlightenment or anything, but it had helped him stop dwelling on that failure.

“Just down the road from Stoke-on-Trent.”

They stared up at the blond like he wasn’t speaking English anymore. Alex shook his head.

The brit sighed. “North of Birmingham?”

Alex did not make the joke about that being a city in Alabama. “Oh, kinda... Upper middle England.”

He took that, flashing a friendly grin.  “Yes, exactly!”

“Well, congrats.” Dominic was done with the new guy already, returning to the conversation he had been having with Alex. “They did fix that problem, right?”

“Mostly. I’ve heard that stacking repairs on repairs can still give you cancer, but it’s a rare side effect. People trying to change how they look all the time. That sort of thing.” Not a problem he had to worry about unless they had to keep swapping hardware out of his head. Having entire parts regrown was a different ball of wax. 

WHile he was happy to continue the conversation, Alex was not done talking to the new guy. Just had the feeling that they were all part of the same crew. He stuck out his hand. “Alex Sorenson.”

“John Abbot.” He was pretty jazzed about this, shaking Alex’s hand with no small amount of enthusiasm and having a seat around the missile crate/coffee table. “You’re the pilot, right?”

“All right, I’m feeling a little behind the times here. How does everyone know who I am?” Seriously, what the hell? “And why don’t I know any of you?”

Crenshaw cleared his throat. “Had an almost all hands meeting last week. You and a couple of the Marines weren’t available.” He seemed a little annoyed about John’s inclusion here.

Alex already had his phone out, scrolling back through his email. “Didn’t even get a notification the meeting was happening, let alone notes it. Figures.”

“They said you were traveling with the Tsla’o, so there was no way to include you.” Abbot was quick to help out. “As you are in pretty good with them, have you had the opportunity to learn much of their language?” 

“A bit. Lots of the basics, but I’ve got a good translator so I haven’t needed very much.”

“He’s our linguistics guy.” Dominic was not enthused about this at all.

“I am, yes. Ah- *Ad akai, Alex. Tena so John Abbot.*” He was proud of that one.

“Close. Either drop the ‘ad’ in front of the ‘akai’ for an informal greeting, or use ‘akai-na’ to make the whole thing formal. I’d actually stick to informal unless you’re meeting a noble.” That *was* pretty good. Perfectly comprehensible, if not an awkward mix of formal and casual. None of the Tsla’o Alex knew would give Abbot trouble for it. “A touch more sibilant on the *s* sounds as well.”

Abbot was scribbling notes on a palm-sized notepad. “Interesting, the only documents I have on Tsla didn’t get into the divide between formal and informal.”

“I’m still in the dark about the finer points. But if you see a hyphen, it’s a normal word made formal.” He was getting a better feel for it, at least. “Or maybe a formal word made informal. I don’t know which way they go. You’ll be in contact with a bunch of folks who do, starting tomorrow.”

He tucked the little notepad and pen back into his shirt pocket. “Be that as it may, I find any insight that is fresh to be useful - particularly if it makes my own first contact less awkward.” 

The PA system came on with a click, the Petty Officer requesting that Dominic return to the print bay. He excused himself to go try his suit on.

Abbot was nervous as Dominic left, watching the Martian leave before turning back to Alex. “You’ve been out there before? I mean... *The place*, but other planets and solar systems too?”

Alex kind of got what he was driving at. “Been all over, yeah. Just came back from Na’o as a matter of fact, which is why I wasn’t at the meeting.”

“I- I haven’t. Today is the second time I’ve left Earth.” He laughed, still very uneasy. “Last week was the first time. Have any advice for a newbie?”

“Try not to sweat it. I know that’s easy to say, but you’re not out here testing new equipment, all of this gear is proven. We’re going somewhere unusual, but having been there, it doesn’t strike me as unsafe.” He weighed what to say next, lips pulled tight for a second. He tapped his chest, right over the sliver of metal in his solar plexus. “If it does the thing, that did hurt a bit even though it passed quickly. Not gonna lie about that.”

Abbot blanched. “Ah, that is helpful and unhelpful all at once.”

“Yeah, that’s exploring things for you.” He shrugged. It was a mixed bag in his limited experience. “I’ve met a few members of the team from both sides now, they’re competent. We’re in good hands.”

“Well. We will be meeting the entire crew tomorrow. I suppose I will see, then.” He was not particularly mollified by that. “What sort of environment suit are you getting?”

“Exo RS4.” They had six e-suits on the list for civilians to choose from, and The Exo RS line was the high end of that. A generalist, made to do a lot of things well. Built-in everything. The helmet was supposed to be fantastic. “I’ve heard good things. Multichrome paint on the armor too. What’d you get?”

“The Rayton Pacesetter.”

“Oh, that one’s actually made in England, isn’t it?” It was also recognized for its durability, common in shipyards, demolition sites, and other places one might be concerned about getting crushed. About as close as one could get to power armor without skirting laws. It made sense for someone nervous about where they were going. It was also bulky. “I’m just going to say, maybe think about something a little lighter for your first outing.”

“Is it bad?” A hint of regret filtered into Abbot’s voice.

“No, it’s a great suit. More intended for construction than getting around.”

“Ah.” He was conflicted, making notes again. “I’ll give it a think tonight.”

Dominic came bounding up to them, this time taking the vehicle lane. The basesuit gleamed in the bay lights, dark gray-black armored skin covering his entire body from the neck down. A dozen hardpoints glowed, waiting to interface with an outer suit. “Damn this thing makes running easy.”

It really did give the impression of a naked body if you weren’t looking too close. Actually it did if you were looking close, too. Bundles of machine muscle flexed over their living Human counterparts, giving Dominic the general outline of a bodybuilder.  Not really something Alex was enthused about when considering someone he had just met forty minutes ago. “Everything green so far?”

He looked like a kid in a candy store. “Yeah, the systems are fine. Just need to finish getting my RS sized now.”

“The RS is a solid choice.” That was mostly directed at John.

Dominic had chilled out about having a third person waiting with them as they resumed their discussion about the Tsla’o and old Mediboard technology, and the wisdom of lighter e-suits when there was enough strength in the base to not notice an extra thirty or fifty kilos. Dominic was also extremely amused by how much he could effortlessly pick up now.

About fifteen minutes later Alex got his. Arrived just in time to watch the suit march itself into the dressing room. It was unsettling to watch a headless, Human-shaped thing walk by itself even though he knew basic pathfinding was built in. You could tell it to march overnight and it would, while you attempted to sleep while marching.

The back pulled open as he approached, from the neck to the calves, the life support pack that covered most of the back stuck to the right side. He slotted his phone and ID card into the spots for those, enhancing his comms and turning the suit itself into his ONI issued ID card, and then stripped down naked and stepped inside.

They tell you it feels weird, and it does. The internal musculature holds the suit open until the limbs are seated and then relaxes, closing up behind you in stages. Gripping the body, part by part. This model was meant to be worn for quite a long time so it has a tube that also grips one thing in particular in lieu of a catheter. Apparently you could do all your business in it, if you had to. Alex wasn’t inclined to try that out, but who knows what the future brings.

Once sealed, the other onboard systems started to come online. Primary battery, life support, comms, emergency equipment. It even connected to two of his near-field comm ports, allowing him to access it with his Amp. The first thing he did was send Ed a text message about how he was sending him a text message using his phone, with his Amp, routed through the comms system on his new basesuit. He found that more entertaining than it had any right to be.

The Petty Officer had him plug in to a diagnostics rig to double check that everything was operating normally. A little walking, running, picking things up, sitting down, standing up. All fine, reading within expected range.

Alex didn’t notice it at first, but there was an option to route the suit’s tactile feedback through his Amp. It left him feeling like there *wasn’t* a thick layer of sintered armor and machine systems wrapped around his entire body. He could manipulate a pen just as easily as he could without the suit on - though the plastic tube did feel quite a bit more fragile.

The Martian had been right as well, it was damn easy to run while wearing it. A test sprint on the way back to the break room ended very quickly as the onboard impact warnings started going off in his mind, the speedometer that flashed up in his vision getting up to 34 kph before he skidded to a stop. That was a bit faster than he had expected, and made the distance between his face and the wall disappear at an alarming rate.

The PA clicked on again and he was reminded that speeds were limited to 20 kph inside the depot.

Alex didn’t have any trouble minding that.

It was nice, talking to some folks that were Human, as they sat around waiting for Abbot’s suit to finish. It had been months since he’d talked to just other Humans, no Tsla’o waiting in the wings. He missed Carbon, and his enjoyment of this moment didn’t change that, but it was refreshing. There was no pretense here - he was getting good at not letting the conversation wander towards things he shouldn’t talk about - no one concerned about his station or that Eleya loomed over his shoulder.

Abbot’s suit was fine, though he was easily the most awkward wearing it. They left the suits at the depot and once again wearing street clothes, went their separate ways. Crenshaw wanted to go hit the bar, something that Abbot agreed to immediately. Alex passed, retiring to his hotel room to attempt to adapt to UTC time, as that was what he’d be running on for at least another month.

Alex stared at the ceiling in the dark again, loss leaving his chest hollow no matter which way his mind turned. He wouldn’t be hanging out with people so casually, friends or otherwise, after this. That portion of his life was gone unless something drastic changed, and he *had* come to terms with that but it was easier to accept when it was more distant.

That dull ache was just as bad when he thought about Carbon and Neya. He loved Carbon, and was very fond of their Zeshen as well. He still felt bad about leaving her behind, and about the charade he and Carbon would be playing. Just a former pilot and his engineer. Friends, but not very good friends.

Another night that took him far too long to go to sleep.

I used lede again.

I'll save you the google, Uttoxeter is a real place in the UK. Now go ahead and google it so you know what it looks like.

And yes, you can poop in your suit. It is awkward and nobody wants to hear about it so shut your comms off until you're done and then keep it to yourself.

Really, don't look up the teeth picture.

A few months ago I met this girl working at a bookshop in a neighboring city I sometimes go to. I went to the shop three times since and everytime I feel like we had some nice conversations, even though I am not entirely sure she recognized me up until last time.

I have developed somewhat of a crush on her, as we share some interests, have a common taste in books and I really liked her attitude. So for the next time I go there (which should be in a couple of weeks roughly) I wanted to ask her out but I am not so sure, even though I really want to do it, it is a great idea.

For once I am really on the fence on whether I is it right to ask her out at her workplace, as I feel that it could be inappropriate. In my head I wanted to give her my number on a note and tell her I wanted to grab a cup of coffee to take the edge out of it, but I'm not sure it is enough.

Secondly, as much as I feel we had pleasant conversatins even outside of the topic of her current work and that she disclosed some things about her private life as well, I may still be just one of the many faces that passes through there and I don't want to mistake her work kindness for a possible interest (albeit I am a rather pessimist person so I do not really expect this to go well per se).

And lastly I am not sure I am in the right headspace for it. I have been struggling with self esteem issues and I feel like I am overthinking this a lot, as this situation has had a stronger hold on my mind than I expected. I may be projecting way too much into this, and I feel like I'm more interested in the possibility of a future relationship than in the actual girl. 

On the other end, this is the first time since 2019 that I feel like I have a genuine crush on someone and tthe drive to do something about it, so I feel like I don't want to waste neither the chance nor time (I thought about going there a few more times and assess things out but if don't go to this other city exactly for this purpose we would be talking about once a month or less, and since she told me we actually live in the same city, skipping a part of this would be in my interest), as it could be a way to “wake me up from this slumber” whether it goes well or not.

Hindi Ito Personal, Ito ay Prinsipyo**

Simulan sa paglilinaw:

*Ang panawagan ng boycott ay hindi dahil sa inggit, politika, o personal na galit. Ito ay paninindigan laban sa mga taong paulit-ulit na nagiging sanhi ng pasakit sa mamamayan habang kumikita sa kalbaryo ng iba.*

Bilang tao, dangal na natin ang niyurakan. Ang prinsipyo ay may karapatan tayo sa malinis na tubig(ayon din ito sa konstitusyon)

SECTION 9. The State shall promote a just and dynamic social order that will ensure the prosperity and independence of the nation and free the people from poverty through policies that provide adequate social services, promote full employment, a rising standard of living, and an improved quality of life for all. 

Ang batas ay bahagi ng tungkulin ng Estado na tiyakin ang access ng tao sa **de-kalidad at makatarungang serbisyong panlipunan**, kabilang ang tubig. Kung walang pananagutan ang mga water provider, nilalabag nito ang obligasyon ng Estado na protektahan ang karapatan ng mamamayan.

**Right to Health and Sanitation (Article XIII, Section 11)**

*“The State shall adopt an integrated and comprehensive approach to health development... There shall be priority for the needs of the underprivileged sick, elderly, disabled, women, and children.”*

Tubig ay hindi luho — **pangkalusugan ito.** Ang batas ay hindi lang para sa efficiency kundi para sa **proteksyon ng buhay** at kalusugan ng publiko.

**2. PrimeWater: Singil Kahit Walang Serbisyo**

Pagmomonopolyo ng tubig sa maraming LGUs

JVA deals na hindi kinonsulta sa publiko

Wala nang ligtas na opsyon — kahit ayaw mo sa PrimeWater, wala kang choice

***“You cannot boycott PrimeWater. You can only endure it.”***

Kaya ang boycott ay dapat ilipat sa mga produkto nilang *maaari mong piliing hindi tangkilikin.*

Ang nangyayari sa ngayon, lumalabas na wala na tayong choice dahil Primewater na ang kasama sa JVA ngayon. Ang sistema, kahit hindi maayos ang serbisyo magbabayad ka pa rin, dahil may basic charge pa kahit wala kang konsumo. Kung sa Primewater ay ginawang sapilitan sa atin dahil basic commodity ito. Makatwiran lang naman na hindi na tayo magbigay pa ng pera sa kanila sa ibang serbisyo.

**3. Konsumerismo ang Sandata: Kung Di Ka Puwedeng Makaiwas sa PrimeWater, Umiwas sa Iba Nilang Negosyo**

Listahan ng mga Villar-affiliated na negosyo:

AllHome, AllDay, Coffee Project, Vista Mall, Camella, Lumina, Bria Homes, etc.

Hindi ito simpleng negosyo — bahagi ito ng isang sistemang nagpapayaman sa kanila habang ang publiko ay nagpapasan ng palpak na serbisyo.

Sabihin mo:

*“Kung hindi natin kayang tanggalin agad ang kontrata ng PrimeWater, kaya natin silang patawan ng pressure sa ibang bahagi ng negosyo nila.”*

**4. Wala Kang Utang na Loob sa Serbisyong Pinagbayaran Mo**

Pondo ng taumbayan ang ginagamit sa “libreng palibing,” ayuda, at mga proyekto

Hindi ito regalo ng politiko — ito ay responsibilidad nila

Pero ipinapresenta nila itong parang “utang na loob” ng mga tao sa kanila

**Ito ang dahilan kung bakit nahihirapan tayong panagutin sila.**

Hindi dapat tayo matakot kung mawawala ang mga serbisyong laan naman talaga sa atin kung sakaling mag-iba ang namumuno sa lugar nio, dahil puede tayong magdemand, dahil taxpayers tayo at may karapatan tayo sa services ng gobyerno. Ang mga services na ito ay nagmumukhang galing sa mga pulitiko, na animo'y galing sa sarili nilang bulsa, pero hindi talaga dahil, galing din ito sa binabayaran nating buwis. Hindi ito regalo ng mgal pulitiko

**5. Kung Walang Accountability, May Power ang Collective Action**

Kung isa-isa tayong tumigil sa pag-suporta, maliit ang epekto

Pero kung sabay-sabay tayong magpasya, nararamdaman ito

Hindi mo kailangang magsimula ng rebolusyon — magsimula ka lang sa *sariling desisyon* mo bilang mamimili

Pwede mong sabihin:

*“Hindi ka powerless. Lahat ng piso mo ay boto rin — boto kung sino ang yayaman, at sino ang dapat mawalan.”*

Hindi laging kailangan ng martsa at megaphone para magkaroon ng lakas ang taumbayan. Ang **coordinated boycott** ay tahimik pero makapangyarihang porma ng protesta. Pwede itong i-frame sa article bilang *“modern, strategic resistance”* na kayang gawin ng kahit sinong ordinaryong mamamayan, kahit hindi lumabas ng bahay.

**Tahimik Pero Matindi: Boycott Bilang Protesta**

Hindi mo kailangang magwelga sa lansangan o sumigaw sa harap ng mall para magpadama ng paninindigan. Kapag sabay-sabay ang mga mamamayan na hindi na bumibili sa negosyo ng mga ganid sa kapangyarihan, *mas ramdam nila ito kaysa sa anumang sigaw sa kalsada*.

Ang boycott ay:

Legal

Tahimik

Di nangangailangan ng permit

Di ma-haharass ng pulis

Pero napaka-epektibo kung sabay-sabay

*“Kapag di na bumibili ang mamamayan, bumabagsak ang negosyo. At kapag nabawasan ang kita ng isang political dynasty, napipilitan silang makinig.”*

Hindi mo kailangang maging aktibista. Hindi mo kailangang maging sikat. Kailangan mo lang gumawa ng isang tahimik pero makapangyarihang desisyon: **“Hindi na ako bibili sa mga produkto ninyo.”**

**6. Panawagan: Please share, Magpaliwanag, Mag-boycott**

Total naniningil ang PRIMEWATER kahit palpak ang serbisyo nila. Makatwiran lang naman siguro na IBOYCOTT O HUWAG NANG TANGKILIKIN LAHAT NG NEGOSYO NILA. TOTAL NAGING PASAKIT NAMAN SILA SA TUMBAYAN, SINGILIN DIN NATIN ANG MGA VILLAR.",21,1748256764.0,Philippines,2,0.96,False

Ang boycott ay:

Legal

Tahimik

Di nangangailangan ng permit

Di ma-haharass ng pulis

For American readers, in Syria under Bashar al-Assad’s regime, air force officers wielded enormous power and inspired genuine fear. They could arrest anyone for virtually anything, often on absurd charges. They are really bad people. They could throw you in prison without any reason and make you disappear for ever, and they can beat you for no reason at all, and you wouldn't be able to object.

I was sitting at home when my phone buzzed with a Facebook message. I opened it to find a message from my neighbor, a woman married to an air force officer. This guy was evil incarnate. So ruthless that if stray dogs looked at him wrong, he'd probably arrest them for ""undermining state dignity and threatening national, water, and air security.""

His face was absolutely terrifying. His expression permanently said: You're guilty until proven innocent, and after you prove your innocence, you're still guilty for trying to prove your innocence, which constitutes questioning the integrity of the original accusation. 

When he looks at you, you feel like you owen him a logical explanation for why you existed on this planet and why you were breathing his oxygen.

My neighbor would message me secretly, always venting about her misery and how unhappy she was in her marriage. I'd listen with half sympathy and half anxiety, not anxiety for her, god forbid, but anxiety for myself because of her psycho husband.

Then one day, I was shocked when she sent me a flood of complaints: Listen, this husband of mine is unbearable. He wakes up angry, goes to work angry, comes home and smokes hashish. He's stoned 24/7. I'm exhausted....would you marry me? I'd divorce him tomorrow

Oh my God..... I felt my heart drop into my shoes. I pictured the officer standing in front of me, waving his gun and saying in a raspy voice: So you're the bug who wants to take my wife?! I quickly replied, trying to sound like a UN diplomat: Listen, you're like my big sister, and I'm not thinking about marriage right now. And the officer, truth be told, is a good man and comes from a good family(he is not lol).

Then I turned off the internet.

That same day, I had plans to hang out with my friend Ahmed at our buddy's place, a guy we called Maestro. He wasn't actually a maestro, but we called him that because he liked to pretend he played piano, when all he really had was a piano app on his phone. We were all university students living and studying in Homs(a city in syria), away from our families who lived in a different city.


We got to his rented apartment, and it was like any typical hangout. One guy telling unfunny jokes, another singing old Amr Diab songs, a third trying to convince us that if we made the cow drink coffee, we'd get coffee with milk. Suddenly, one of the guys threw a joint on the table and said: Hey guys, wanna try something to change the mood?

Me, having never tried such things before, thought to myself: Brother, life is short, and you're going through severe depression, so why not? Once won't hurt.

So I took a hit.....two.....three.... I entered another dimension.

I was about to write poetry about a cucumber sitting on the table, but before I could compose an entire collection titled ""You Are the Cucumber in a World of Tomatoes"" I got a Facebook message.

I opened it. The neighbor: Should I divorce my husband or not? What did you say?

Under the influence of that joint, I felt like the hero of a Hollywood romantic movie. I thought to myself: brother, why not? I'm a man, and if the officer gets mad, let him get mad. Where's the problem! Let him go to hell with his rank and his scary face. I wrote: hell yeah. I'll marry you. Come on, get divorced and we'll secretly get married tomorrow. I sent the message, laughing and telling Maestro: imagine, I'm going to marry my neighbor. Maestro, who was in another world himself, said while laughing: congratulations, groom! Just don't forget to invite me to the wedding, I'll bring my piano (knowing full well he didn't own a piano, as I mentioned).

The night ended with Maestro explaining his plan to open a shawarma restaurant on the moon, describing how the low gravity would make the shawarma easier on the stomach. We decided to leave before he convinced us to invest in his project.

Ahmed and I walked down Hadara Street in Homs, and it was past 2 AM. The world was quiet, but I was still under the influence of the joint. Suddenly, an old man in a worn coat appeared near a dumpster and said quietly: god bless you, help me with anything so i can buy food, god bless you in the name of the prophet mohamed.

Under the influence of hash, I felt a wave of generosity I'd never known in myself. I felt like king Faisal at the height of his giving. I opened my wallet, which contained money my family had sent as my weekly allowance, and said in a booming voice like I was addressing the UN: take it, uncle, you deserve the world and everything in it. I pulled out fifty thousand. Yes, fifty thousand. And gave it to him. The man opened his eyes like he'd seen Ali Baba's treasure and said: oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, god reward you, god grant you success, god preserve your youth, God....etc.

And Ahmed, the other stoned guy who was laughing, said: what are you doing, you maniac? Give him more, what, are you being cheap?

I replied with complete seriousness: what's wrong with you? I swear to God, I gave him everything in my wallet, look and see (I opened my empty wallet). You give him something if you're so generous.

Ahmed opened his wallet and gave him everything he had: 35 thousand.

The man replied: god grant you success and provide for you. Go on, may God open doors for you

Before leaving, the man turned and asked me: god reward you, uncle, but if you don't mind, could i know what's today's date? I'm a bit lost.

I said with complete confidence: the date, uncle? The date is 2023. The year of goodness, blessing, and giving.

The poor man stared at me with a ""what the hell"" look and said: no no, son, god bless you, i mean today's date in the month, like what day of the month is today? Not the year.

Me, with all the stubbornness of a stoned person insisting on his opinion and ready to argue even if you told him the sun rises in the east, said: uncle, why are you arguing? The date is 2023. The year of goodness, blessing, and giving (knowing we were actually in 2021).

The man was puzzled, then continued on his way.

I went back to Ahmed's rented place and slept.

In the morning, I woke up with a headache. I opened messenger and saw the messages. I was shocked. I felt like Judgment Day had arrived. I opened my wallet and found it empty. I remembered the beggar and screamed: the fifty thousand!!!!!!

I ran to Ahmed and told him the messenger disaster from the beginning. He burst out laughing and said: brother, just confess to her and tell the truth that we tried a joint. You have no other solution

I stood there for a moment and thought: wait a minute, kid! She was complaining to me about her husband who smokes hash, only to find herself complaining to another person who smokes the same stuff. Oh, the irony of fate.But in the midst of this thinking, a devilish idea flashed in my head, I found it a golden opportunity for her to get off my back and leave me alone and stop burdening me with her marital problems that I had nothing to do with.

And indeed, I confessed to her that I was a very, very bad person who smoked hash daily and drank alcohol(not really, of course)

She was shocked. After that, she completely cut off communication with me, no messages, no complaints, nothing. Praise be to God.

TL;DR: Got high once, proposed to a married woman, and donated my entire wallet to a random guy

But let me be honest, while they’re fun to look at, I didn’t treat them like the final word.

Sometimes the site showed a 90% match, and after one conversation, I knew we couldn’t even agree on tea vs. coffee. On the other hand, one profile had a lower match score, but our vibe was just what we needed. So, I quickly learned: those numbers are just a guide, not a guarantee.

As for horoscopes, Sangam does offer detailed charts, which were helpful because my family is super into that stuff. We downloaded kundlis, matched stars, and even checked for doshas. It saved time, especially when talking to families who take astrology seriously.

But personally? I believe in talking more than star signs. Horoscope said ""average match"" with the person I eventually married. Reality? Perfect match.

So yes, the tools are helpful, especially for traditional families, but don’t rely on them as a final verdict. Use your brain and the stars, and you'll be right on your way.",1,1748256482.0,u_AirlineSuccessful747,0,1.0,False

I keep replaying everything in my head. Every smile she gave me. Every time she leaned her head on my shoulder. Did she ever feel it? Or was I just a placeholder until something better came along?

It hurts more than I thought it would.

(OBVIOUS SPOILERS.),"I binged stinky dragon 7am to 3:30 every day for about the last few weeks, loved it, so incredibly much.

So incredibly much I actually bought myself a set of die and player handbook today. This podcast is so damn incredible it had me crying, on a factory floor for everyone to see, so thanks Micah and Gus and Ben for having me roll a nat 1 on a deception check, when my manager asked me why I was crying and I said 'they killed my favorite character' before continuing to pack switchboards while in hysterics.

  
I am really finnicky with spoilers, so until I finished the first chapter I vowed to stay away from all fan driven spaces for the podcast. Due to never having viewed any DnD content before too I never saw a puppet video or animated short. I have very clear mental images for how I viewed every character. So here are my written descriptions for every character.

Mud: Carol, from where the wild things are, but with pink hair. Gumbo was a badger, but I pictured him as an earthbending badger from avatar. (Badgermole?)

Bart: A mix between Bart Simpson, in terms of stature nose and hair, with a very obtuse and square build. Also very ginger.

Gum Gum: My sweet beautiful boy, I imagined him as a deep green slender orc with an underbite and two tusk-like teeth. His flower wand as a long gandalf like staff wrapped in vine and flowers. And him wearing night blue wizard robes and a hat with white stars, that was way too big for him.

KYBORG THE MIGHTY / KYDEALIUS OF EVER WINTER THE GOAT: I imagined him to have long illustrious flowing blonde hair. (It was shorter than I expected.) And links breath of the wild tunic but green. 

I imagine Fred, to be an alolan vulpix, but more foxlike and nimble like an animal jam fox.

  
Dr Ahem: A teal hunchbacked dragon headed dude that had very big glasses, and his scales were very shiny. Obviously a lab coat.

Paralight: Mother Gothel from rapunzel, but with straight black hair and a more angular face, I imagined her hair was ever so slightly purple to the ends of it and she was extremely pale with blacked out eyes, in a black cloak similar to the ever guards. (Was paralight a monk?)

Sleek: Bart, but with a luscious black mullet and a more muscular build

Spectral: A blue skinny orc-like dude with an orange and yellow cloak? No idea why I pictured him this way.

  
Entropa: a mix of the ghost that scares spongebob in that one episode and the wither storm from minecraft story mode, but red, obviously.

Diah: The Virgin Mary, but blonde and in a robe draped in pure light, also she cycles through colors like RGB lights.

Duncan: A chinese style dragon, but much smaller, a deep crimson red with a yellowish underbelly and wearing a black suit, coffee in hand.

I have to wake up early if I want to exercise and feel good about my day before heading off to work. It’s genuinely not an option to skip for the sake of my mental health right now, I desperately need the routine and release. Here’s a daily routine to maybe provide context: 7-8am wake-up. 1.5c Coffee. 4-6mile walk or hot yoga or both. Shower, lunch, go to work. Come home, make/eat dinner. I eat a paleo based diet. Do some yard work or most often rest. I am a full time online college student working toward a masters- I do homework roughly between 8pm-12am. Realistically I’m getting 4-5 solid hours of sleep and it’s awful. I need like 9 hours. I’m constantly tired… exhausted, I’m trying to lose weight and cannot, I want to sleep earlier but I have so much homework and I’m truly braindead when I get home from work that I have to muster the energy to get it done.

I’m trying so hard to get through school to give myself a good life and solid career. I dream about having hobbies, dating, having a social life, feeling rested, having time to keep my house clean, just sit and look at things, ect. I’m so burnt out for many other serious personal things going on. I went through a very traumatic event  few years ago and haven’t never fully recovered, time just passed. This is the “best” I’ve don’t in a long time. I’m also very isolated and lonely. The sleep is a my biggest issue right now and I’m at a breaking point. I have to work to live. I have to go to school to get out of this situation. I have to workout to stay sane and try to lose weight. How the heck do I get through this.

When I lay down, I’m so excited and relieved to be in bed. I’ve deleted apps to reduce the temptation to scroll. I just can’t seem to relax. It’s not insomnia. My body is like… afraid to calm down? My brain won’t. stop. thinking. I’m constantly on autopilot and I feel highly dissociated. I used to be a deep thinker and felt very fulfilled and happy to work through the world around me, now I just have repeat surface level thoughts.

I haven’t seen double digits since well before I had my first kid 7 years ago. 15.5kg gone so far!

Still a long way to go (goal is 70kg), but I genuinely didn’t think I’d ever get back under 100. I’ve been stuck bouncing between 102–100.2 for the last 4 weeks and it was driving me mad. So last week, I decided to try something different and jabbed my Mounjaro in my arm for the first time (usually do my stomach) and… boom I’ve dropped 1.1kg since Friday’s jab. For me there definitely seems to be something in changing the jab site. 

No crazy side effects either, just needed a nap or two. Tuesdays are normally my lowest weigh-in days before I creep back up slightly again before the next jab on Friday, so I’m really hoping this sticks!

Honestly, I don’t even know what my point is except I’m just so grateful for this medication and this second chance. 

Some non-scale wins I’ve noticed lately:
	•	I actually fit in the bath properly now. The water flows around me instead of my body acting like a dam wall. 
	•	My plantar fasciitis barely plays up anymore unless when I wear dodgy shoes.
	•	I was this close to needing to size up in jeans a few months ago…now they’re feeling a bit loose!
	•	I’ve lost some of that neck/chin puffiness, and people are starting to comment (in a good way).
	•	I’m not craving coffee, chocolate or soft drink anymore. Which is insane for anyone who knows me. 
	•	And the best one? I’ve got more energy to play with my kids at the playground instead of just sitting and watching.

Anyway, I’m just so excited for what’s next!

1kvr7gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1kvr7gz/i_work_at_a_dollar_tree_store_in_south_dakota/,"I work at a Dollar Tree Store in South Dakota, There are STRANGE RULES to follow! (Part 1)","\[[ Narrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnd36OLusS0) by Mr.Grim \]

My name is Tyler Whitehorse, and I've been running the night shift at Faith's only Dollar Tree for eight months now. Before you ask—yes, that Faith, the one with a population that hovers around 421 depending on who's counting and whether the Bergman family has fled to Rapid City for another ""extended vacation."" The kind of place where everyone knows your business before you do, and the Lakota reservation boundary runs so close you can see the prairie grass shift color where treaty lines were drawn.

I ended up here after my discharge from Fort Carson. Military police doesn't translate well to civilian life, turns out. My sister Marlena had been pestering me to move closer to home ever since Dad's funeral, and when she mentioned that old Harvey Koerner needed someone reliable for the graveyard shift at his Dollar Tree, it seemed like fate. Twelve dollars an hour to stock shelves and ring up late-night purchases in a town where the most exciting thing that happens is when the high school football team makes it past the first playoff round.

What Marlena didn't mention—what nobody mentions when you're new to Faith—is why Harvey needed someone for the night shift in the first place. Why the previous guy, Danny Elk Horn, quit without giving notice. Why customers sometimes come in at 2 AM asking for specific items in voices that don't quite match their faces.

Faith sits in a pocket of the Great Plains where the wind carries more than just the scent of sweet grass and cattle. The Lakota have stories about this stretch of land, stories that predate the town by centuries. Stories about things that learned to wear human shapes but never quite perfected the act.

My first clue something was off came during my second week. A woman walked in around 3:15 AM—pale, probably mid-thirties, wearing a sundress despite the October frost. She moved through the aisles like she was sleepwalking, picking up random items and setting them down in different spots. A pack of AA batteries in the greeting card section. Canned peaches with the automotive supplies. When she finally approached my register, she held out a crumpled five-dollar bill and asked for ""the usual.""

I had no idea what her usual was, but something in her glassy stare made me ring up a single pack of birthday candles. She nodded once, took the candles, and walked straight out into the parking lot. I watched through the window as she got into a rusted Chevy pickup and drove north toward the reservation. The weird part? Her license plate was from 1987.

That's when Harvey showed up the next morning with a wrinkled piece of paper covered in his shaky handwriting. ""Rules for the night shift,"" he called them. Twenty-three specific instructions that seemed random at first—until I realized they weren't suggestions.

They were survival tactics.

Harvey's hands shook as he handed me the list. ""Danny lasted four months before he broke,"" he said. ""You seem steadier. Military training might help."" He paused at the door, looking back with eyes that had seen too much. ""Faith's got its own way of testing people, Tyler. These rules aren't about the job. They're about making it through the night.""

I should have walked away then. But twelve dollars an hour was twelve dollars an hour, and I'd seen worse things in Afghanistan than small-town weirdness.

Or so I thought.

The rules Harvey handed me were written on the back of old receipt paper, the kind that yellows at the edges and smells faintly of thermal ink. His handwriting was cramped, like he'd been trying to fit too many thoughts into too little space.

FAITH DOLLAR TREE - NIGHT SHIFT PROTOCOLS: Rule 1: Lock the front door at exactly 11:47 PM. Not 11:45, not 11:50. The town clock chimes at 11:46—wait for it to finish. Rule 2: If someone knocks after hours, check their reflection in the security monitor first. If their reflection moves differently than they do, ignore the knocking completely. Rule 3: Never stock the back corner of Aisle 7 after midnight. The greeting cards there rearrange themselves anyway. Rule 4: When the phone rings three times then stops, unplug it. Don't plug it back in until you see headlights pass by going east. Rule 5: The elderly Lakota woman who comes in for salt always pays with exact change. Count it twice. If there's an extra penny, leave it on the counter overnight.

The list went on. Twenty-three rules total, each more bizarre than the last. I folded the paper and slipped it into my shirt pocket, figuring Harvey was just eccentric. Small towns breed that kind of quirky behavior.

My third night alone, I learned he wasn't eccentric at all.

The store felt different after dark. During day shifts, Dollar Tree was just another retail box—fluorescent lighting, cramped aisles, the persistent smell of cardboard and Chinese plastic. But once the sun disappeared behind the grain elevator on Main Street, something shifted. The building seemed to settle differently, like it was exhaling after holding its breath all day.

I was restocking the pharmacy section around 10:30 when I noticed the greeting cards in Aisle 7 rustling. No air circulation back there, no reason for movement. I walked over to investigate, flashlight in hand since two of the overhead bulbs had been flickering for weeks.

The cards hung on metal pegs in neat rows—birthday wishes, sympathy notes, generic ""thinking of you"" designs. But as I watched, they began rotating on their hangers. Slow, purposeful turns. A ""Happy Anniversary"" card spun to face the wall. A condolence card flipped upside down. Within minutes, every card in the back corner displayed blank white backs instead of colorful fronts.

I grabbed one and flipped it over. The front side was completely empty—no text, no images, just smooth cardstock the color of bone.

""What the hell,"" I whispered, reaching for another card.

My phone buzzed. Text from Harvey: Following the rules yet?

I looked at my watch. 11:44 PM. The rules said to lock up at 11:47, wait for the town clock to chime at 11:46. I'd been so focused on the cards that I'd nearly missed it.

Racing to the front, I grabbed my keys and waited. The old courthouse clock began its nightly ritual, eleven deep bongs echoing across the empty streets. On the final chime, I turned the deadbolt.

Three seconds later, someone tried the door handle.

I stepped back, watching through the glass. A figure stood just outside the pool of light cast by our parking lot lamp. Average height, wearing what looked like a winter coat despite the mild October weather. They tried the handle again, more insistently this time.

Rule 2 flashed through my mind. Check their reflection in the security monitor first.

The black and white screen above the register showed the front entrance clearly. The figure stood there, hand on the door handle, but their reflection was doing something else entirely. While the person outside appeared to be pulling on the door, their reflection was waving at the camera.

I watched, mesmerized, as the reflection began pointing toward the back of the store while the actual figure continued yanking on the locked door.

Then the knocking started. Slow, rhythmic taps against the glass. The reflection never moved its hands.

I forced myself to turn away from the monitor and focus on my closing duties. Stock the pharmacy shelves. Count the register. Update the inventory log. Normal tasks to keep my hands busy while something that wasn't quite human tried to get my attention outside.

The knocking continued for twenty minutes before finally stopping. When I looked at the monitor again, both the figure and its mismatched reflection were gone.

My phone rang at 12:15 AM. Three sharp rings, then silence. I stared at it, Harvey's fourth rule echoing in my memory. Unplug it. Don't plug it back in until headlights pass going east.

The phone cord came out of the wall socket with a soft pop. Now I had to wait for eastbound traffic, which could take hours in a town like Faith. Most folks were asleep by 10 PM, and the highway ran north-south anyway.

I settled in behind the counter with a Mountain Dew and a bag of stale pretzels, trying to process what I'd witnessed. Military training had taught me to trust my observations, but nothing in Afghanistan had prepared me for reflections with minds of their own.

Around 1:30 AM, a pair of headlights finally swept past the store, heading toward the reservation. I plugged the phone back in, half-expecting it to immediately ring again. Instead, it stayed silent for the rest of my shift.

When Harvey arrived at 6 AM to relieve me, he took one look at my face and nodded knowingly.

""You met one of them,"" he said. It wasn't a question.

""What are they?""

Harvey hung his coat on the peg behind the counter. ""Wish I knew for sure. Been happening since they built this store, though. Maybe before that, even. The Lakota have words for things that pretend to be human."" He paused, studying the security monitor where normal morning traffic was beginning to appear. ""Your people probably know more about it than mine.""

I wanted to ask more questions, but Harvey was already shooing me toward the door. ""Get some sleep, Tyler. Tomorrow night might be worse.""

As I drove home, the morning sun painting the prairie grass gold, I couldn't shake the image of that mismatched reflection. Or Harvey's casual mention of ""your people."" I was only one-quarter Lakota, but apparently that was enough for Faith to notice.

I spent the next day researching Faith's history at the public library, a converted railroad depot that smelled like old paper and radiator heat. Mrs.Hartwell, the librarian, was helpful enough until I started asking about the Dollar Tree's location.

""Used to be Peterson's Five and Dime,"" she said, suddenly busy with filing returned books. ""Before that, empty lot. Nothing special about it.""

But her eyes shifted toward the Lakota History section when she said it, and I caught the hint.

The tribal records were more forthcoming. The land where the store sat had been a traditional crossing point—a place where the boundary between worlds grew thin during certain times of year. European settlers had avoided building there until the 1960s, when Peterson's grandfather decided the ""Indian superstitions"" were keeping prime real estate off the market.

Peterson's Five and Dime burned down in 1987. No clear cause, but three employees had quit in the months leading up to the fire, all citing ""strange customers"" and ""things that didn't add up."" The lot stayed empty until Dollar Tree's corporate expansion reached rural South Dakota in 2019.

I showed up for my fourth night shift armed with this knowledge and a thermos of coffee strong enough to wake the dead. Maybe not the best expression under the circumstances.

The evening started normally. A few customers trickled in before closing—teenagers buying energy drinks, an elderly rancher picking up motor oil, a young mother grabbing diapers and formula. Regular people with regular needs.

At 11:47, I locked the door and settled in for another weird night in Faith.

She arrived at 1:23 AM.

I heard the footsteps first—soft, careful steps on the sidewalk outside. Then a gentle tap on the glass door, not the insistent knocking from the night before. I looked up from my inventory sheets to see an elderly Lakota woman standing patiently by the entrance.

She was small, maybe five feet tall, with gray hair braided down her back and a blue wool coat that looked handmade. Her face was weathered like old leather, and her dark eyes held the kind of patience that comes from seeing decades pass like seasons.

Rule 5 flashed through my mind: The elderly Lakota woman who comes in for salt always pays with exact change. Count it twice. If there's an extra penny, leave it on the counter overnight.

I unlocked the door.

""Evening, grandmother,"" I said in Lakota, using the respectful term my dad had taught me.

Her face brightened. ""Ah, Harvey finally hired someone with sense. You're Whitehorse's boy, aren't you? You have his eyes.""

""You knew my father?""

""Knew your grandfather better. Good man. Understood the old ways."" She stepped inside, moving with the steady gait of someone who'd walked countless miles across prairie grass. ""I'm Agnes Crow Feather. I come for salt.""

I led her to Aisle 3, where the table salt and kosher salt shared space with spices and baking supplies. Agnes examined the options carefully before selecting three containers of Morton salt—the plain white cylinders with the girl under the umbrella.

""Grandmother, if you don't mind me asking—why do you shop so late?""

Agnes looked at me with eyes that seemed much older than her face. ""Same reason you work so late, grandson. Some things only move in the dark.""

At the register, she counted out exact change: four dollars and seventy-seven cents. Three singles, seven quarters, and two pennies. I counted it twice, as the rules specified. The math was perfect.

""The salt helps,"" she said as I bagged her purchase. ""Sprinkle it around your house before dawn. Keep the lines clear.""

""Lines?""

""Boundaries. Between what belongs here and what doesn't."" She paused at the door. ""Your grandfather knew about boundaries. Made sure your father learned, too. Shame it didn't pass down complete.""

After she left, I found myself staring at the register, thinking about her words. My dad had never mentioned anything about supernatural boundaries, but he'd been full of what I'd dismissed as old-fashioned superstitions. Don't whistle at night. Never point at graves. Always leave tobacco for the spirits when crossing certain places.

Maybe they weren't superstitions.

The phone rang at 2:15 AM. Three sharp rings, then silence. I unplugged it and went back to restocking the candy aisle, waiting for eastbound headlights.

That's when I noticed the man browsing the automotive section.

I hadn't heard him come in, which should have been impossible since the front door chimed whenever it opened. He was tall, maybe six-two, wearing jeans and a flannel shirt that looked normal enough. Dark hair, clean-shaven, probably in his thirties. Nothing obviously wrong with him.

Except he'd been in the same spot for twenty minutes, holding the same bottle of windshield washer fluid, and I couldn't hear him breathing.

I watched him from behind the register, pretending to organize receipt rolls while keeping one eye on Aisle 6. He stood perfectly still, like a mannequin, the blue bottle frozen in his right hand.

My military training kicked in. Assess the threat. Plan an escape route. Trust your instincts.

My instincts were screaming.

I pulled out Harvey's rules and scanned them quickly. Nothing specifically about customers who didn't breathe, but Rule 7 caught my attention: If someone stands in the same spot for more than fifteen minutes without moving, announce that the store is closed for inventory. They should leave. If they don't, call this number: 605-555-0847.

The number looked local. I grabbed the store phone—still unplugged—and considered my options. I could plug it back in and make the call, but Rule 4 said not to reconnect it until I saw eastbound headlights. Breaking one rule to follow another seemed like a dangerous precedent.

""Excuse me,"" I called out instead. ""Store's closed for inventory.""

The man didn't respond. Didn't even turn his head.

""Sir? We're closed.""

Still nothing. The bottle of washer fluid remained suspended in his grip, defying gravity and logic.

I decided to risk plugging the phone back in. Whatever was standing in Aisle 6 felt like a bigger threat than violating Rule 4.

The number rang twice before a familiar voice answered. ""Agnes here.""

""Mrs.Crow Feather? This is Tyler, from the Dollar Tree. I have a situation.""

""The tall one in flannel?""

""How did you—""

""I'm three blocks away. I'll be right there.""

The line went dead. I stared at the phone, wondering how Agnes had known exactly what kind of help I needed.

Five minutes later, she knocked on the door. I let her in, noting that she carried a small leather pouch in her left hand.

""Where is he?"" she asked.

I pointed toward Aisle 6. Agnes nodded and walked purposefully toward the automotive section, her footsteps echoing in the quiet store.

""You don't belong here,"" she said to the motionless figure.

The man's head turned—not smoothly, but in quick, jerky movements like a bird. When he faced us, I saw that his eyes were completely black, reflecting the store's overhead lighting like wet stones.

""Store policy says I can browse,"" he replied. His voice sounded like it was coming from the bottom of a well.

Agnes opened her leather pouch and scattered something across the floor—coarse white crystals that looked like rock salt mixed with crushed bone.

""Store policy doesn't apply to things that don't need to buy anything,"" she said calmly.

The man-thing took a step backward, and I heard the windshield washer fluid bottle hit the floor. The sound echoed wrong, like it had fallen much farther than three feet.

""The boy called the police,"" Agnes lied smoothly. ""They'll be here soon.""

For the first time since I'd noticed him, the creature showed genuine reaction. His face contorted, features shifting like clay being reshaped by invisible hands.

""This isn't over,"" he said, and walked toward the back of the store.

I expected him to try the emergency exit, but instead he simply faded—not disappearing, but becoming less solid with each step until he was gone entirely.

Agnes gathered up her salt mixture and tucked the pouch back into her coat.

""What was that thing?""

""Hungry,"" she said. ""They're always hungry. Been getting bolder lately, too.""

""How did you know I needed help?""

She smiled, the expression transforming her weathered face. ""Salt creates more than boundaries, grandson. It carries messages, too. Old magic, older than this town.""

After Agnes left, I sat behind the counter trying to process what I'd witnessed. The rules weren't just random instructions—they were part of a larger system, one that connected Harvey, Agnes, and probably others in Faith who understood what really moved through the darkness.

Around 4 AM, a pickup truck drove east past the store. I plugged the phone back in and finished my shift without further incident.

But as I drove home, I couldn't shake the feeling that the creature's parting words weren't just a threat.

They were a promise.

I didn't sleep well after my encounter with the thing in Aisle 6. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw those black, reflective pupils staring back at me. When I finally dozed off around noon, I dreamed of my grandfather—a man I'd only met twice before his death when I was eight.

In the dream, he stood in a field of prairie grass that stretched to the horizon, wearing the same red flannel shirt I remembered from childhood visits. But his face was serious, lined with worry.

""The hungry ones are testing you, takoja,"" he said, using the Lakota word for grandson. ""They know you carry the blood, but they're not sure if you carry the knowledge.""

""What knowledge?""

""The boundaries are weakening. Too many people in Faith have forgotten the old agreements. The salt and the rules help, but they're not enough anymore.""

I woke up with his voice still echoing in my ears and the taste of prairie dust in my mouth.

That evening, I stopped by Agnes Crow Feather's house before my shift. She lived in a small white farmhouse on the edge of town, with a garden that somehow still bloomed despite the October frost. Wind chimes made from small bones hung from her porch, creating soft melodies that sounded almost like whispered words.

""You look tired, grandson,"" she said, opening the door before I could knock.

""Bad dreams. About my grandfather.""

Her expression sharpened. ""Joseph always was good at reaching across. Come in.""

Her living room was filled with the kind of furniture that survives decades—a worn leather couch, hand-carved wooden end tables, quilts draped over everything. But what caught my attention were the mirrors. Every reflective surface in the room had been covered with black cloth.

""Mirrors show too much in a house like this,"" Agnes explained, noticing my stare. ""Some things are better left unseen.""

She poured us both coffee from a pot that looked older than me, then settled into a rocking chair that creaked with familiar rhythm.

""Your grandfather visited me three days ago,"" she said casually.

""That's not possible. He died fifteen years ago.""

""Death doesn't stop everyone from visiting, especially those with unfinished business."" She sipped her coffee, studying my face over the rim. ""He's worried about you. Says the hungry ones are planning something bigger than usual.""

""What kind of something?""

""The boundary crossing happens every October, when the veil grows thin. Usually it's just a few lost spirits wandering through, maybe something hungry looking for an easy meal. But this year."" She set down her cup, the porcelain clinking against the saucer. ""This year something's been calling them. Gathering them.""

Agnes walked to an old cedar chest in the corner and pulled out a leather-bound journal filled with yellowed pages. ""This belonged to your great-grandfather, Thomas Whitehorse. He helped the town founders make the original agreements back in 1923.""

The pages were covered in neat handwriting, some in English, some in Lakota syllabary. Sketches of symbols filled the margins—circles, lines, geometric shapes that seemed to shift when I looked at them directly.

""The agreements were meant to keep Faith safe,"" Agnes continued. ""Certain locations were designated as crossing points, places where the spirits could pass through without harming the living. In exchange, the town would maintain the boundaries and respect the old ways.""

""But people forgot.""

""People forgot. The crossing points got built over, the boundary markers removed. Now the spirits have nowhere safe to go, so they're making their own paths."" She pointed to a map tucked between the journal pages. ""Your Dollar Tree sits right on top of the main crossing point.""

I studied the map, noting how many of Faith's current businesses were built over what Thomas Whitehorse had marked as sacred locations. The courthouse, the gas station, even the high school.

""So Harvey's rules.""

""Are the only thing standing between Faith and a complete breakdown of the barriers. Harvey's grandfather was there in 1923. The rules got passed down, adapted for modern times.""

Agnes closed the journal and fixed me with a stare that seemed to look straight through to my soul. ""But Harvey's getting old, and the rules aren't enough anymore. The spirits are getting desperate, and desperate spirits do dangerous things.""

I left Agnes's house with more questions than answers and a growing sense that my night shift was about to become much more complicated.

The Dollar Tree felt different when I arrived at 10 PM. The air inside seemed thicker, charged with the kind of electric tension that comes before thunderstorms. Even the fluorescent lights seemed dimmer, casting shadows in corners where no shadows should exist.

I ran through my opening routine—count the register, check the inventory sheets, review Harvey's rules one more time. But tonight I noticed something new: Rule 24, written in different ink at the bottom of the page.

Rule 24: If you hear your name being called from the storage room, do not answer. Do not investigate. Turn the radio to 94.7 FM and leave it there until dawn.

The rule was written in my own handwriting, though I had no memory of adding it.

My shift started quietly. A few regular customers came and went—Mrs.Peterson buying cleaning supplies, teenage Jake Hoffman grabbing snacks for a late study session, old Mr.Reeves picking up his weekly supply of Copenhagen. Normal people doing normal things.

At 11:47, I locked the door and began my real work.

The first sign of trouble came at 12:30 AM, when I heard footsteps in the storage room. Heavy, deliberate steps, like someone wearing work boots. I checked the schedule—no deliveries expected, and Harvey never came in during night shifts.

The footsteps continued, accompanied by the sound of boxes being moved around. Then I heard my name.

""Tyler."" Clear as day, coming from behind the employee door. ""Tyler, can you help me back here?""

The voice sounded like Harvey, but Harvey was home asleep, and Rule 24 was very specific about not answering calls from the storage room.

I walked to the radio behind the counter and tuned it to 94.7 FM. Static filled the store, but underneath the white noise I could hear something else—soft chanting in a language I didn't recognize.

""Tyler, where are you?"" The voice was more insistent now, and it definitely sounded like Harvey. ""I need you to unlock the back door.""

I gripped the counter edge and forced myself to stay put. The chanting on the radio grew louder, drowning out the voice from the storage room.

Twenty minutes later, the footsteps stopped.

At 1:15 AM, the phone rang three times and went silent. I unplugged it and settled in to wait for eastbound headlights.

That's when I noticed the customers.

Three people stood in different aisles—a middle-aged woman in Aisle 2, a teenage boy in Aisle 5, and an elderly man near the pharmacy. I hadn't heard them come in, which should have been impossible with the locked door and functioning door chime.

The woman was reading the ingredients on a can of green beans, holding it close to her face like she was having trouble with the small print. The teenage boy stood frozen in front of the candy display, one hand reaching toward a pack of Skittles. The elderly man appeared to be examining cold medicine, but his head was tilted at an angle that made my neck ache just looking at it.

None of them were moving. None of them were breathing. And all three cast shadows that didn't match their positions.

I pulled out Harvey's rules and scanned them quickly. Rule 11 seemed relevant: If more than two people enter the store simultaneously without making the door chime, they are not people. Turn off all the lights except the emergency exit signs. They will leave on their own.

But there were three of them, and Rule 11 specifically said ""more than two."" Did that mean the rule applied, or was I dealing with something else entirely?

I decided to trust the pattern. All the lights were controlled by a master switch behind the counter. I flipped it, plunging the store into near darkness except for the red glow of the exit signs.

The effect was immediate and disturbing. All three figures began moving—not walking, but gliding across the floor like they were on invisible tracks. The woman in Aisle 2 turned her head 180 degrees to look at me, her neck rotating with the soft sound of grinding bone. The teenage boy's mouth opened wider than humanly possible, revealing rows of teeth that belonged in a shark's jaw. The elderly man near the pharmacy began laughing, a sound like wind through dry leaves.

They converged on the counter where I stood, moving in perfect synchronization. As they got closer, I could see that their eyes were the same bottomless black I'd encountered the night before.

""Store policy says we can browse,"" the woman said in a voice that echoed from three throats simultaneously.

""Store's closed,"" I replied, surprised by how steady my voice sounded.

""Store policy says—""

""Store policy doesn't apply to things that don't cast proper shadows,"" I interrupted, remembering Agnes's words.

The three figures stopped moving. For a moment, the only sound in the store was the static from the radio and the hum of the refrigerated cases.

Then they began to laugh—the same dry, rustling sound multiplied by three. The sound grew louder, echoing off the walls and ceiling until it felt like the building itself was laughing.

""The boy learns quickly,"" they said in unison. ""But learning and surviving are different lessons.""

The laughter stopped abruptly. All three figures turned toward the front door and glided away, passing through the locked glass like it wasn't there.

I turned the lights back on with shaking hands and tried to process what had just happened. Three entities, clearly working together, testing my knowledge of the rules. But unlike the solitary creature from the night before, these things had seemed almost.. amused by my responses.

Like they were enjoying a game I didn't fully understand yet.

The radio continued broadcasting its static and chanting until dawn, when I finally switched it back to the local country station. As the first rays of sunlight hit the parking lot, I found myself wondering how many more tests I'd have to pass before something decided I'd failed.

And what would happen when that moment came.

A pickup truck drove east past the store at 5:30 AM. I plugged the phone back in and finished my inventory, but my hands kept shaking as I wrote down stock numbers.

When Harvey arrived at 6 AM, he took one look at my face and nodded grimly.

""Three of them this time?""

""How did you know?""

""Because it's getting close to Halloween, Tyler. And Halloween in Faith isn't like Halloween anywhere else.""

Halloween was three days away, and Faith felt like a town holding its breath.

I noticed it first in the customers who came during evening hours—the way they moved faster through the aisles, grabbed what they needed without browsing, avoided making eye contact. Mrs.Bergen bought twelve packs of salt instead of her usual one. The Henderson family stocked up on batteries and candles like they were preparing for a blizzard. Even the teenagers seemed subdued, their usual after-school energy replaced by nervous glances toward the windows.

Harvey had been adding rules almost daily. My pocket-sized list now contained thirty-one entries, some crossed out and rewritten, others added in different colored ink. The most recent addition appeared that morning, written in Harvey's increasingly shaky handwriting:

Rule 32: October 29th, 30th, and 31st - Do not work alone. Agnes Crow Feather will assist. Follow her instructions without question.

I found Agnes waiting in the parking lot when I arrived for my shift at 10 PM. She sat in an old Ford pickup that looked like it predated the Clinton administration, smoking a cigarette and watching the store entrance with the patience of someone who'd done this before.

""Evening, grandson,"" she said, climbing out of the truck with a canvas bag slung over her shoulder. ""Ready for the real work?""

""What's in the bag?""

""Tools of the trade."" She pulled out several items as we walked toward the store—small bundles of dried sage, a Mason jar filled with what looked like cornmeal, several pieces of carved bone, and a thermos that rattled when she moved it. ""Your great-grandfather's recipe for keeping the crossing stable.""

""Crossing?""

""The main one runs right through the center of the store, from the pharmacy section to the back wall. During the thin nights, it becomes a highway."" She paused at the door while I unlocked it. ""Tonight, we're traffic control.""

The store felt different with Agnes there. The oppressive atmosphere I'd grown accustomed to seemed lighter, like her presence was pushing back against something I couldn't see.

""First thing,"" she said, opening her thermos and revealing a mixture of coarse salt, crushed eggshells, and something that smelled like cedar smoke, ""we mark the boundaries.""

Agnes walked the perimeter of the store, sprinkling her mixture in a thin line along the walls. She paid special attention to the corners, creating small circular patterns that reminded me of the symbols in Thomas Whitehorse's journal.

""This won't stop them,"" she explained as she worked. ""But it'll make sure they follow the rules while they're here.""

""What rules?""

""The original agreements. No harming the living, no permanent possession, no taking anything that isn't freely given."" She completed the circuit and returned to the counter. ""Of course, they've gotten creative about what counts as 'freely given' over the years.""

At 11:47, I locked the front door as usual. Agnes settled into a folding chair she'd brought, positioning herself where she could see both the main crossing area and the front entrance.

""Now we wait,"" she said.

The first visitor arrived at 12:15 AM.

It looked like a woman in her forties, wearing a blue dress that might have been fashionable in the 1950s. She walked through the locked door like it was made of mist, her feet making no sound on the linoleum floor.

""Evening, Margaret,"" Agnes called out.

The woman turned toward us, and I saw that her face was translucent, like looking at someone through frosted glass. ""Agnes. Still playing gatekeeper?""

""Still playing by the rules, I hope.""

Margaret smiled, an expression that was more sad than threatening. ""Always the rules with you people. Can't a girl just browse?""

""Browse all you want. But no touching the merchandise, and no frightening the help.""

""The boy's not scared,"" Margaret said, looking directly at me. ""He's got the sight. Sees us for what we are instead of what we pretend to be.""

She was right. Unlike the predatory creatures I'd encountered before, Margaret felt.. tired. Worn down by decades of wandering. There was hunger in her eyes, but it was the hunger of someone who'd forgotten what food tasted like, not the predatory need I'd sensed in the others.

Margaret spent twenty minutes walking the aisles, occasionally reaching toward items but never quite touching them. When she finished, she nodded politely to Agnes and walked back through the door.

""One of the old crossers,"" Agnes explained. ""Been making this trip for sixty years. Died in a car accident out on Highway 212, but she keeps coming back to finish her shopping. Harmless enough.""

The second visitor was less harmless.

It crawled through the wall near the pharmacy section around 1:30 AM—something that might have been human once but had been changed by decades of existing between worlds. Its limbs were too long, jointed in places where joints shouldn't be, and its face was a shifting mass of features that couldn't quite decide what they wanted to look like.

Agnes stood up immediately, pulling one of the carved bones from her bag.

""This one doesn't follow agreements,"" she said quietly. ""It's been feeding on the boundary itself, getting stronger.""

The thing oriented on us, its not-quite-face splitting into what might have been a grin. When it spoke, the voice came from everywhere at once—the walls, the ceiling, the floor itself.

""Grandmother. You're looking old.""

""Old enough to remember when you were still mostly human, Billy Hawk.""

The creature's features shifted again, briefly resolving into the face of a young man before dissolving back into chaos. ""Billy's long gone. I'm something better now.""

""You're something hungry,"" Agnes corrected. ""And you're breaking the boundaries by feeding on them.""

""The boundaries are weak. The town forgot the old ways, forgot the prices that need paying. I'm just taking what's owed.""

Agnes raised the carved bone, and I heard her begin chanting in Lakota. The creature that had been Billy Hawk recoiled, its form becoming less stable.

""The boy carries the blood,"" it hissed, focusing on me. ""He could feed the crossing instead of guarding it. Make everything stronger.""

""The boy knows better,"" Agnes replied, still chanting.

""Does he? Tyler Whitehorse, grandson of Joseph, great-grandson of Thomas. The crossing remembers your family. It remembers the promises made.""

The creature began moving toward us, its elongated limbs bending in ways that hurt to watch. Agnes's chanting grew louder, and the bone in her hand began glowing with soft blue light.

""What promises?"" I asked, though part of me already knew I didn't want the answer.

""Blood for passage,"" the thing that had been Billy Hawk whispered. ""A life freely given to maintain the balance. Your great-grandfather made the deal. Your grandfather honored it. Your father tried to run from it.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. My father's death hadn't been a heart attack at fifty-three. It had been something else, something connected to this place and these creatures.

""Lies,"" Agnes said firmly, but I caught the hesitation in her voice.

""Ask her about the real Rule 1,"" the creature suggested. ""Ask her why there are always Whitehorse men working the crossing points. Ask her why Harvey needed someone with the blood.""

Agnes's chanting reached a crescendo, and the bone in her hand flared bright enough to cast shadows across the entire store. The creature shrieked and began dissolving, its form breaking apart like smoke in wind.

""This isn't over,"" it managed before disappearing entirely. ""The debt comes due on Halloween night.""

The store fell silent except for the hum of refrigerated cases and the distant sound of wind against the windows.

Agnes lowered the bone, her hands shaking slightly. ""Grandson.""

""Is it true?""

She was quiet for a long time, studying the place where the creature had vanished. ""There are things your family never told you. Things they hoped you'd never need to know.""

""But I need to know them now.""

Agnes returned to her chair, suddenly looking every one of her seventy-something years. ""The original agreement required a guardian for each crossing point. Someone with the sight, someone connected to the old ways. The job.. it changes people. Wears them down.""

""And the blood debt?""

""Insurance. If the guardian fails, if the crossing becomes unstable, someone from the bloodline has to step in. Permanently.""

The rest of the night passed quietly, but I couldn't shake the creature's words or the weight of Agnes's revelation. I was part of a system I'd never agreed to join, carrying a debt I'd never contracted.

When Harvey arrived at 6 AM, he took one look at both of us and seemed to understand what had happened.

""Billy Hawk finally showed himself,"" he said. It wasn't a question.

""He's stronger than before,"" Agnes replied. ""Feeding on the boundary energy. Halloween night, he's going to make a play for permanent access.""

Harvey nodded grimly. ""Then we'd better make sure Tyler's ready.""

As I drove home, the morning sun doing little to warm the October chill, I realized that everything I'd learned about Faith and the Dollar Tree had been preparation for something I was only beginning to understand.

Halloween was two days away, and apparently, my family's debt was coming due.

I spent Halloween morning at the cemetery where my father was buried, staring at his headstone and trying to reconcile the man I remembered with the guardian Agnes had described. Robert Whitehorse, 1970-2023. Beloved son and father. The inscription said nothing about supernatural debts or boundary crossings.

""You could have told me,"" I said to the granite marker. ""Could have prepared me for this.""

The wind picked up, rustling the dried leaves that had gathered around the grave. For a moment, I thought I heard something in that sound—not quite words, but something like an apology.

My phone buzzed. Text from Agnes: Meet me at the high school. Need to show you something before tonight.

Faith High School sat on the north edge of town, a brick building from the 1960s that housed maybe two hundred students on a good day. Agnes waited in the parking lot, her old pickup truck loaded with supplies—more salt, bundles of sage, and several items I didn't recognize.

""Your great-grandfather's journal mentioned three crossing points in Faith,"" she said without preamble. ""The main one under the Dollar Tree, a smaller one here at the school, and the largest one unde

Here’s a daily routine to maybe provide context: 7-8am wake-up. 1.5c Coffee. 4-6mile walk or hot yoga or both. Shower, lunch, go to work. Come home, make/eat dinner. Do some yard work or most often rest. I am a full time online college student working toward a masters- I do homework roughly between 8pm-12am. Realistically I’m getting 4-5 solid hours of sleep and it’s *awful*. I’m constantly tired… exhausted, I’m trying to lose weight and cannot, I *want* to sleep earlier but I have so much homework and I’m truly braindead when I get home from work that I have to muster the energy to get it done. 

I’m trying so hard to get through school to give myself a good life and solid career. I dream about having hobbies, feeling rested, having time to keep my house clean, just sit and look at things, ect. I’m so burnt out for many other serious personal things going on. I’m also very isolated and lonely. The sleep is a major issue and I’m at a breaking point. I have to work to live. I have to go to school to get out of this situation. I have to workout to stay sane and try to lose weight. How the heck do I get through this. 

When I lay down, I’m so excited and relieved to be in bed. I’ve deleted apps to reduce the temptation to scroll. I just get seem to relax. It’s not insomnia. My body is like… afraid to calm down? My brain won’t. stop. thinking.

Courmayeur is pretty quiet right now. Most restaurants, cafes and shops are closed but you can still get what you need from the supermarkets in town.

It starts with a couple of km of Asphalt from the Courmayeur old town and across the river before climbing through an older village and then turning off the path.

There's a pretty waterfall to the left once you get past for forest trail and it becomes an unmade road. I hit snow 2km from the top and turned back but it could be possible to pass. I didn't try as it was my first day here and I was just introducing my legs to the mountains and I have plenty of other trails to be doing.

1kvr1d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysians/comments/1kvr1d8/foreigner_and_malay_relationship_advice_both/,Foreigner and Malay relationship advice (both married),"During the last winter holidays I met a Malay man who worked in the resort where I was staying with my family, with whom I started a long-distance relationship.

For context, my husband and I are both white Europeans, but from different countries. We both work in IT, met on a project abroad, lived and got married in London, and then moved to my home country in Eastern Europe once we had our two kids (now 3 and 7). We have been together for over 12 years, married for 10+, but our relationship has been strained over the last few years due to moving countries, Covid, highly pressured jobs, having children, living in a country where only I speak the local language, building a rental business, dealing with health issues for both of us and the declining health of our parents (all over 70).

We are both high net worth individuals, making over €200-300k/each/year, and with a total net worth of close to €4 mil. Most of it is invested in property, as we are both freelancers and as such will not enjoy a significant state pension. I manage my full-time job which involves international travel along with the various companies we set up for our IT and rental businesses, my husband is primarily focused on work and rarely travels. One of our worst points of contention is that he believes we should only have one holiday a year as a family in order to save money for our retirement, and not to spoil our children - whereas I am of the opposite opinion, I don't spend money on expensive clothes or bags, but I enjoy travelling and seeing the world, and wish to give my kids the same curiosity.

This winter was our third time in Malaysia, but it was a difficult time as my husband would refuse to do anything during the day due to migraines/the heat, and would blame me for selecting the destination, the hotel etc (although we had obviously consulted before booking). Most days ended up with him in the room during the day while I had the kids for various activities. In the evenings he would take over and watch movies and have dinner in the room with them, while I went out to the lobby for a drink, or outside for walks etc. During one of these evenings a Malay man approached me in the lobby while a live band was playing, and we connected over our love of music. We started meeting almost every day, going for a coffee or a meal, walking on the beach - a couple of times we booked a room and the relationship became physical as well (as we couldn't really do anything in public). We found that we are very compatible (although the gripes I have with my husband are not sexual in nature, it's more the wear and tear of our marriage and the life we've built together), but primarily this new man made me feel seen and valued.

At the time, I discussed with him that it would be great if we had more time and privacy to get to know each other better, and we agreed he would come over to Europe for a couple of weeks in the summer. Since I left in Jan we've been speaking on Whatsapp almost every day, we know about each other's lives and families and daily routines. We are both 40+, he's got four children, of which the youngest are 7 and 10, and the second eldest got married recently. I helped him with a loan of 15k ringgit for the wedding, of which he already paid me back 5k.

He seems to have a life of struggle, where he has his job at the resort, a car workshop, several village restaurants and every spring he buys and sells cattle (he calls this a feedlot?). We discussed getting married so I could stay in the country long-term on a spouse visa, but I am not sure I am willing to rip my family apart for this, not to mention that on some level I realise that holidaying in Malaysia and living in Malaysia are probably two very different things. He says he would have to give me the same amount of time and money if we were to get married as for his first wife (which I realise is probably important to him culturally, but he would kill himself in the process).

He mentioned being willing to follow me to Europe as he says his wife would be fine with him leaving as long as he sends her money for the household, but I am not sure there would ever be work in Europe he would find satisfying (his restaurants and car workshop would likely continue, as he’s got a son-in-law now). In addition, he tells me he tries to give his wife 15k every month, which seems high for Malaysia - this would require a significant income stream even in Europe. I am not willing to take on the responsibility of another family right now, as some of our current investments are not finalised, and I worry that he would miss his young children in particular.

This month I've had the opportunity to travel to Australia and on the way back I stopped in Malaysia, where I collected him and then we flew together to another SEA country. He was very happy being away, holding hands, kissing in public. We had a really great time, I enjoyed getting to know him and being with someone so different from me - but at the same time I am wondering if this is enough... I am highly educated (MBA level) and can hold a conversation on most topics, whereas he is more into tiktok, Muslim politics. We don't speak English with the same fluency and sometimes it is difficult to communicate more complex points. I like most things about him, he has a very calm, chilled way about him. I don't like how much he smokes - even in the hotel room, which I warned him about (I'm not a smoker).

I have no idea why I'm writing all this, but thank you to anyone who has managed to read this far :) I am not sure what to wish for from this relationship, maybe on some level I am wondering if anyone has seen anything similar among friends? Did a very complex situation somehow work out in the end? Does anyone have any thoughts about how to resolve this?

I’ve been thinking hard about what the next steps should be and whether a relationship like this has any chance to develop into something other than a “holiday fling” in the future.

Part of me thinks the easier option would be to focus on my family for now, and hope that by the time our kids are all grown up that we somehow reconnect, if it’s meant to be? I do realise this would mean leaving him with his life of struggle, which he is at peace with, but I think I would also miss him. I am not particularly happy in my marriage, although I love my husband… And I keep thinking that life is short.",0,1748255214.0,malaysians,20,0.5,False
1kvr0zz,https://i.redd.it/0bsyw8s7s33f1.jpeg,"First Time Trying a 2-Week Gap Instead of Weekly Mounjaro — My Honest Maintenance Experiment (5mg, Age 50, Diabetic)","After reaching my goal weight, I decided to run a little experiment. For the first time, I spaced out my Mounjaro 5mg shots to every two weeks instead of my usual weekly dose. I wanted to see if I could maintain both physically and mentally with a lower intervention—while gently testing my food tolerance at the same time.

I reintroduced a few small pleasures:
	•	A second scoop of rice with my fish and vegetables
	•	Ice cream twice a week
	•	Half a burger with sugared iced tea and a few fries
	•	A week of coffee with creamer instead of plain black
	•	Occasional dessert bites—just little indulgences, not binges

I also kept up mild isometric workouts and stayed mindful of my diabetes. My glucose readings stayed normal, thanks to the meds—but internally, something was still off.

Here’s what happened:
My weight jumped five pounds almost immediately. That told me loud and clear: my body—especially with insulin resistance—still can’t handle even small amounts of sugar or processed food. Even with controlled blood sugar levels, the weight gain tells a deeper story about how my metabolism responds.

Still, Mounjaro remains a huge help—even at a small dose, and even every two weeks.
It doesn’t completely kill my appetite or alter my taste buds (since I’ve never gone beyond 5mg), but it does give me the most important gift: self-control.

Before Mounjaro:
	•	Eating felt automatic, emotional, and impossible to manage
	•	I had zero communication with my body when it came to hunger
	•	Buffets meant multiple trips and overeating
	•	Stress caused emotional spirals and unhealthy behaviors
	•	My brain felt foggy, overwhelmed, and sluggish

Now:
	•	I can pause and say, “That one bite was enough”
	•	I still enjoy food—but I don’t chase it
	•	I can go to a buffet, sample small portions, and walk away proud
	•	My mental clarity is sharper than it’s been in years
	•	I manage stress better, focus more, and even learn new skills with excitement instead of anxiety
	•	I no longer feel like food has power over me

It’s like Mounjaro unlocked a part of my brain that had been sleeping. I feel like I have a clean slate—a blank page I can finally write on without the chaos of compulsive eating or emotional overload. Even with just 5mg every two weeks, I’m still gaining so much.

The biggest reward? Being able to tell myself,
“Stop eating. You’re full. You’re okay now. You enjoyed that. You don’t need more.”

That inner voice didn’t exist before. Now, it’s stronger than ever—and that’s more valuable than any number on the scale.",10,1748255174.0,MounjaroMaintenance,1,1.0,False

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™

I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”



Here’s what keeps me going:

* Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.
* Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.
* Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.
* Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.
* Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.
* Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.



Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

* You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).
* You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.
* You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.
* You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).
* You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.
* You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.



Why Message Me?

* Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
* Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
* Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
* Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.

1kvqzjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultramarathon/comments/1kvqzjj/grand_trail_courmayeur_gtc100_recce/,Grand Trail Courmayeur (GTC100) - Recce,"I'm in the Italian Alps training for a couple of races. One is Grand Trail Courmayeur and I thought it might be useful to others to share my experiences and it would be great to hear those of others, whether that's about the race, other trails in the area or the area itself. I'll update this post as I recce the course or come across things that I think will be helpful.

The area is pretty quiet right now. Most restaurants, cafes and shops are closed but you can still get what you need from the supermarkets in town. There's a pizza/pasta place in the centre called the Tunnel that's fairly priced. I've eaten there once and it was fine. Pizza + water + fries was #24 There's a decent cafe called La Buvette that's open that's a bit further out of town but still walkable. 2 coffees and 2 croissants was €7. As most places are closed both get busy.

I'm here in a camper van and there's a few place you can park overnight for free. Again, it's pretty quite at the moment but there's plenty of campers around. The sports center has toilettes and showers for €2

As for the route I've recced Maison Vieille - Benva - Pavillon and half way to Lechy, pulling off at La Palud to get back into Courmayeur.

My overall take so far is that the climbs are pretty hard and there plenty of technical stuff that makes coming down more interesting.

**Maison Vieille to Brenva**  
I took the Checrouit trail from Courmayeur to Maison Vieille and this was a beautiful and gentle trail through a pine forest. The descent from Maison Vieille is very technical at the start, steep with significant tree roots. It then opens out onto an unmade road (ski road) all the way to Brenva.  
  
**Brenva to Pavillon**  
Over the river the same road then goes up the other side and gets increasingly steep. This eventually becomes a super steep and in places precarious path through the forest. This eventually opens out but remains steep - my Garmin said an average of 26%. Towards the last 4-500m of climbing there's a really steep direct path and another that criss crosses it to make it a bit easier. This climb went on forever. Another runner I met said it's the hardest on the route which is a bit of a relief. The top of this climb is where the drop bags are. The balcony has great views if you have time to stop.

**Pavillon to Lechey (I left the trail at La Palud)**

This is a nice runnable trail down an unmade road initially which then becomes a runnable pine forest trail that opens out again onto an unmade road down the asphalt road. From here I went right down to Courmayeur by road for about 3-4km. The race route goes off to the left and hopefully off the main road.
