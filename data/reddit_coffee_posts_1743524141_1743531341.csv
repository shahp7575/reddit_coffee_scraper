Imagine you enter a dimly lit, tucked-away caf√© after a day at work. The rich aroma of freshly ground, dark roast coffee in the air, with the sharp bitterness holding on to your senses. As you take a seat on that cozy armchair, a whisper of warm vanilla floats from the counter, softening the sharpness of the coffee. It's not an intensely sugary sweetness, but a subtle creamy undertone, like the faint scent of a vanilla latte lingering in the background.

This scenario is what this perfume encapsulated from it's first wear.

The presentation, unfortunately is where it falls short, earns a 3/5. The perfume did not come in a box, at least mine didn't as it was a giveaway, but the bottle comes with a functional and aesthetically pleasing wooden cap leaving the presentation with nothing to complain about.

Projection & Longevity: 5/5. This scent performs admirably. A decent 1ft projection is noticed for an hour followed by 8-9 hours of lasting. This being case for a mix of office and outdoor wear for the day.

Overall: 5/5. Whatever this perfume lacks in the packaging, it more than makes up for in the scent profile and the evident quality of ingredients used.  A 100ml bottle retails for INR 1500, with smaller sizes available. While the price might seem a bit steep for a lesser-known perfumer, if you crave a true, dark coffee note without excessive sweetness, this fragrance is a perfect match.",1,1743531261.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,0,1.0,False

Everyone used to tease each other by pairing names, and while I had no interest in her, the constant teasing started putting ideas in my head.

One day, she texted me, and casually, I asked her out for coffee. She didn‚Äôt reply to that message. That hurt my ego, so I stopped talking to her. Later, when she finally asked why, I told her, but she brushed it off, saying it wasn‚Äôt a big deal‚Äîa friend can take a friend out. That‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôd been friendzoned. So, I decided not to ruin the friendship and went back to normal.

But after that, she started acting distant and dry. Our conversations felt forced, so I distanced myself again. Later, when we spoke about it, I told her she had been acting weird, and she said she didn‚Äôt want to lead me on. I played it cool at the time, but honestly, that made me really angry. Since then, I‚Äôve been treating her more like a classmate than a friend.

Now, everyone keeps telling me to talk to her, saying I‚Äôm being egoistic or childish. I even unfollowed her from my spam account because she never liked any of my posts, even though she‚Äôs always online. People say I‚Äôm acting like a kid, but I don‚Äôt know‚ÄîI just don‚Äôt feel like talking to her anymore.

The first week I gained 5 lbs on it, since then I‚Äôve lost 4.3 of those lbs. My fat to protein ratio is 70%fat to 30% protein roughly every day. Carbs are always under 5 grams - most days 2-3. Mostly due to eggs. 

Why am I not seeing any weight loss on strict carnivore? I can‚Äôt get into keto at all. I have the breath analyzer and keto strips. Results are always under 1. Breakfast is usually a cup of decaf coffee with a tablespoon of heavy cream, I was putting a pat of butter in it but stopped that after 2 weeks. Eggs, bacon or sausage for breakfast. I usually skip lunch and eat a ribeye, or other type of steak or hamburgers with a slice of cheddar and bacon for dinner. Or the occasional pork chop. If I eat a snack it‚Äôs usually pork rinds or a mozzarella sticks. 

My husband is down 15-20lbs in 5 weeks eating the same exact stuff. It‚Äôs getting really frustrating not losing anything. Esp since I go to the gym 3-4x week and walk at a moderate pace on the treadmill for a half hour and do the circuits for 45min lifting 30-70lbs depending on the machine. No change in how my clothes fit either. It‚Äôs like my body is fighting to not lose an ounce of weight. I don‚Äôt know what to do to fix this issue. Any suggestions?

We've sanded a couple of times and used wood bleach and wood filler and considering how bad it was when we started, I'm pretty happy with our progress. I don't mind that the floors will have some discoloration.

However! Yesterday we applied a coat of Loba EasyPrime and splotches appeared that look like spilled coffee. I don't remember seeing anything like this before we put on the EasyPrime. The floor looks much worse now and I'm hoping I don't have to just accept that it will look like this. I want to keep the natural color of the floor as much as possible, so my plan has been to apply only EasyPrime and EasyFinish, without a stain.

Would anybody have any thoughts about (1) what caused this and (2) what I might be able to do to treat it?

The attached images are of (1) a wide view of the floor before the EasyPrime application (the one with the vacuum cleaner and blower), (2) a wide view of the floor after application, and (3) a close-up of one of the splotches. You can see the darker area that was stained by the urine in the wide view images, running from the top middle of the picture to the lower left, parallel to the wall. The splotches are mostly in that area, but not entirely.

# Maintaining UPC, EAN, or GTIN Accuracy for ASINs

# Purchase UPCs from GS1 for Authenticity

Amazon demands sellers to take their UPC numbers exclusively from GS1 Global Standards 1 to validate their products. GS1 acts as the worldwide product barcode authority and connects each UPC variation exclusively to brands they represent.¬†

Using third-party UPCs purchased from resellers creates a risk of ASIN suppression because the system detects the mismatch.

* If a coffee brand owner selects a UPC from an unauthorized seller instead of purchasing it from GS1 they will face this problem. Amazon identifies that the UPC number belongs to a different entity based on GS1‚Äôs database records. Amazon blocks the listing from appearing while the seller encounters brand problems with restoration.

**Amazon FBA**¬†Sellers need to register with GS1 and buy UPCs from their official source to avoid this problem.

¬†After buying barcodes sellers should sign up with GS1 to link their product ownership details correctly. The system prevents the sale of products with fake barcode labels and protects the original brand information.

Buy UPCs from GS1 that match each distinctive product edition including various presentations and package types. Using one UPC for multiple product variants causes listing problems that make shoppers confused about what they bought.

Sellers who get barcodes from GS1 follow Amazon rules and reduce the risk of losing their listings. This protection method keeps product barcodes secure for ASINs which helps maintain their stability in the future.

# Make Sure Product Barcodes Are Valid Before Listing Items For Sale

You must check the UPC, EAN, or GTIN valid status in GS1‚Äôs database before starting a new product listing. Amazon verifies product codes sent by sellers so listing problems occur when their submitted identification does not match GS1 global registry data.

* An electronics¬†[Amazon FBA seller](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-amazons-new-policy-updates-for-dietary-supplement-amazon-fba-sellers-in-2024/)¬†buys UPC barcodes from an online vendor who says they offer legal Amazon codes. When the seller adds their product Amazon spotlights an incorrect UPC number against GS1‚Äôs database. Amazon detects the improper listing entry and takes away sales show and reduces listing visibility.

**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should access the online data system from GS1 before they add¬†[product listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/from-click-to-cart-how-to-optimize-your-amazon-product-listings-for-sales/). Sellers can verify UPC validity and compare it to their product branding through GS1‚Äôs online tool by simply typing in the UPC.

Extension of UPC entries at product input often creates formatting issues in Amazon imports. The new system from Amazon identifies exact digit mistakes in UPCs which makes the platform block listings automatically. Verify UPC entries twice to stop problems from arising with your listings.

Sellers who conbrand their UPCs before posting prevent potential suppression problems from appearing on their listings. Their products stay available for sale and ready to attract new customers through this assurance.

# Maintain Uniform Product Ids Throughout Your Sales Platforms

Every product identifier throughout different sales channels including Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, and eBay must stay the same. Product listings will be at risk if you use different UPC numbers on different sales channels.

* The beauty brand uses different UPC codes to represent its serum product on Amazon and Walmart. Amazon system monitors UPC mismatches and conbrands product misrepresentation. The system takes the listing offline until certified verification of product authenticity arrives from the seller.

**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should track their UPCs from a single system to guarantee each product displays the proper identifier on every marketplace. The new system helps sellers watch stock levels and sales activities in one report.

Maintaining the same UPC codes helps stop wrong sellers from putting up incorrect product copies on different channels. When sellers display their UPC everywhere they sell products this makes it simpler to catch owners when their rules are broken.

Having the same product identifier on every selling platform makes a brand more trustworthy while lowering risk of marketplace actions and letting sales move smoothly across different sales channels.

# Keep One Unique ASIN For Each Universal Product Code¬†

Amazon prohibits sellers from making several ASINs for a single product when using the same Universal Product Code. Amazon unites or deletes these listings because¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers must use one unique ASIN for each product.

* The fitness brand wants to reach various audiences by publishing the same resistance band listing under distinct ASIN numbers. The Amazon system finds matching UPC entries which makes the listings merge together. The system inconsistency affects the product pricing and makes it harder for sellers to reach their marketplace goals.

To stop this from happening sellers should avoid establishing multiple listings with the same product details. They need to enhance the presentation of each item by updating image quality, bullet point details, and A+ Content elements.

The seller should regularly review their¬†[product listings](https://www.inc.com/inc-mastershow-to-enhance-your-amazon-product-listings.html)¬†to prevent duplicate items under multiple ASINs. After finding duplicate ASINs sellers should contact Amazon support to combine them and prevent problems from happening again.

A seller can operate efficiently without suppression risks when the product catalog remains easy to navigate.

# Make Sure Your Bundle Or Multi-Pack Listings Use Unique Product Codes From Amazon

A new UPC is required for bundled product sets. Do not use the standard item UPC when selling multiple product packages.

* A supplement seller provides three-pack protein powder packs. They need to get a new UPC code for the collection given that they cannot use the product UPC code. The platform detects problems when¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers include product bundles with their single unit UPC.

Amazon demands that each package bundle requires its own unique identification numbers to let customers tell single items from multi-packs. Retailers need to obtain extra UPCs from GS1 to create bundled products.

By correctly marking standard products separate from bundles Amazon users can find items more easily and maintain marketplace requirements.

# Regularly Audit UPCs for Changes in GS1 Database

GS1 checks and verifies all UPCs in its system to maintain sellers‚Äô Amazon policy compliance. When GS1 updates its records suppliers need to adjust their product listings or else run the risk of ASIN suppression.

* A clothing brand that sold its famous jacket series for many years loses its product listing because of this issue. When scanning the barcodes the seller notices that GS1 changed the ownership data for their UPCs. Changes to their product listings go unnoticed by the system which marks their items as unlawful.

To maintain product accuracy sellers need to review their UPCs regularly in GS1‚Äôs database. Stone should update his listing data for Amazon immediately when GS1 changes brand or product ownership.

An UPC validation tool automates the task to make it easier for users to obtain accurate results. This software compares GS1 database data against seller items daily and sends warnings about mismatched information.

Regularly checking UPC accuracy during listing maintenance stops sellers from losing their selling privileges due to data errors.

# Sign Up Your Brand to Amazon Brand Registry to Protect Your Products

Amazon Brand Registry gives sellers the best way to protect their product listings by preventing anyone from changing their assignment numbers without permission. The program connects product links to brands to stop unauthorized¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers from using incorrect UPCs and selling fakes.

* A premium kitchenware brand selling chef knives can protect their¬†[product listings through Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/increase-amazon-sales-with-product-listing-variations-complete-guide/)¬†Brand Registry sign-up. Through Amazon Brand Registry they defend their product representation because they can regulate the listings of incorrect UPCs from unauthorized sellers.

After registering their brand with Amazon the platform delivers correct product data to brand owners before third-party sellers. Through Brand Registry sellers obtain access to Amazon Transparency and A+ Content tools which effectively defend their brand assets.

Brands need to set up Brand Registry when their brand starts to safeguard their future rights. The trademark requirement for registration needs early planning to run without issues.

Using¬†[Amazon Brand Registry enhances](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-add-amazon-enhanced-brand-content/)¬†sellers‚Äô ability to protect their ASINs and enhances the trust customers place in their brand.

# Check Seller Central To Find And Solve UPC Quality Problems

The¬†[Seller Central dashboard from Amazon](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/vendor-central-vs-seller-central/)¬†shows listing health information to identify UPC data issues. Sellers should check the reports regularly to find and solve UPC problems before getting their listings suspended.

* Pet supplies sellers spot a Product Identifier Invalid error while reading their listing performance results. The problem creates an automatic ASIN block if not fixed on time. Taking care of the issue without delay allows the Amazon FBA seller to run their brand without interruptions.

Amazon changes its listing rules often which makes UPC codes that once worked invalid. By reading error reports sellers find and solve problems ahead of time to keep their brand running smoothly.

The seller should create alert notifications through Seller Central to receive UPC issue updates. Ever-running monitoring systems help protect against unexpected listing removals and keep products active online. Sellers who promptly fix UPC errors will keep their ASINs active and prevent problems with their sales.

# Enter The Right UPC Version For Each Platform You Sell On

Amazon runs its brand across various countries and demands unique product identifier systems for each marketplace. Markets need sellers to employ the right UPC or GTIN codes as per their selling market requirements.

* A clothing brand from the United States moves its operations to Amazon Germany. The brand enters U.S. listings using UPC but neglects to update to EAN for their European product profiles. Amazon Germany denies listing their product which causes a delay in their product launch.

**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers need to check barcode standards for every marketplace they list their items on before starting sales. Using the proper barcode format simplifies product listing approval and stops incorrect listing issues.

Sellers leverage Amazon‚Äôs Global Listing Tool as a tool to run UPC data in multiple markets effectively. This tool creates a single product identification system that matches each marketplace format.

Sellers who keep UPC data correct for each marketplace can successfully branch out into international markets.

# Protect Your Unique Product Numbers From Being Misused By Unauthorized Sellers

A normal Amazon issue arises when unauthorized sellers use brand-owned UPCs to list their unauthorized products often made of inferior quality. When unauthorized sellers damage brand image through improper listings Amazon may suppress their listings permanently.

* A home decor label identifies unauthorized sellers using its unique product codes to offer low-quality counterfeits. The fake goods reach customers who write bad reviews that destroy the brand‚Äôs trustworthiness.

Sellers need to watch their Amazon product listings and use¬†[Amazon Brand Registry](https://medium.com/@muhammad.mohsin381a/amazon-brand-registry-the-ultimate-guide-to-protecting-your-brand-6863026a396f)¬†plus ‚ÄúReport a Violation‚Äù to report any unauthorized sellers they find. By joining Amazon‚Äôs Transparency program sellers get tools to spot and stop unauthorized duplication of their UPC codes.

When you apply this system you prevent unauthorized¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers from using your UPCs which controls brand protection and preserves listing quality.

# Keep Complete UPC Data Files Ready When Seeking Help From Amazon Support Team

Record keeping is necessary for both Amazon and UPC transactions to fix selling problems with Amazon. UPC documentation proves to Amazon that they made a mistake when they marked your listing as invalid.

* A seller sees this message when they receive valid GS1 UPC codes but still Amazon identifies them as invalid. They restore their ASIN through documented proof of purchasing barcodes from GS1.

Upc records sorted correctly enable sellers to resolve listing problems fast and keep their sales uninterrupted.

# Only Get Upcs When You Need Them For Private-Label Products

The Handmade and Custom Products section does not need UPCs according to Amazon standards.¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers must use GTIN Exemption if it applies to skip buying barcodes they do not need.

* A seller who crafts jewelry bought multiple UPCs even though they create unique rings for each design. They simplify their listing process and lower expenses by applying for GTIN Exemption.

Distinguishing UPC needs from exemptions enables sellers to select the best listing strategy that saves them money.

# Set All UPC Data In Batch Data Imports To The Same Format To Avoid Entry Issues

Excel sheet imports for a large number of listings can create formatting errors that affect UPC accuracy. Organize UPC data entries in a uniform manner to avoid listing rejections.

* A toy seller uploads thousands of ASINs without problems through a single file import process. A failed formatting process shortens UPC codes which damages new listings. Their quality check of uploaded file types protects their ASINs from being deactivated without reason.

Routinely checking submitted data with official templates before publishing prevents product listing mistakes.

# Make Sure To Update UPC Information

When a product changes its manufacturing source, sellers should update the necessary information regarding the Universal Product Code or UPC. The seller needs to match the new product identifiers to their¬†[Amazon listings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-use-holiday-slowdown-to-revamp-amazon-listings/)¬†during this process.

* When a skincare brand moves its production to a different manufacturer they receive fresh UPC enrollments. The seller needs to replace their product information to avoid issues between current and previous stock.

When manufacturers do not update UPCs during changes they create incorrect product records and force listings to be suppressed.

# Teach Your Team How to Apply UPC Management Standards Effectively

All employees in charge of¬†[Amazon listings need](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-a-premium-content-why-do-you-need-it-for-your-amazon-listing/)¬†thorough training about UPC management to manage product data accurately. When you misuse UPCs you can expect your listings to be disabled and inventory to become unreadable.

* An electronics retailer‚Äôs new employee made a wrong assignment by using the same UPC for products that did not connect. The system performs an instant suspension of product listings. They teach employees the right UPC management techniques to maintain correct use and decrease mistakes.

Teams understand Amazon‚Äôs barcode standards better when they receive official guidelines and barcode education.

# Avoiding Keyword Stuffing in Product Titles and Descriptions

# Prioritize Readability Over Keyword Density

Your product title must be easy to understand from the start. Several Amazon sellers make the mistake of using many different keywords in their product listing titles as they believe this helps them rank higher.

¬†Amazon‚Äôs ranking system A9 gives higher preference to user experience and keyword stuffing ruins both ease of reading and generates fewer sales. A product title set in a clear layout helps people trust the item and easily determine what it does.

* When selling a stainless steel water bottle make sure the product title is both direct and educational. A suitable title should be ‚ÄúLeak Proof Stainless Steel 24 oz Water Bottle Stays Cold Up to 24 Hours.‚Äù The title reveals all main product features in an easy-to-understand way.
* The highly stuffed title ‚ÄúStainless Steel Water Bottle Cold Hot Leakproof 24oz Best Durable Insulated Thermos Flask Travel Bottle‚Äù creates a messy and unprofessional impression. The variety of keywords weakens customer confidence and decreases engagement because the content becomes hard to read.¬†

Amazon‚Äôs system may lower a disorganized listing‚Äôs rankings because shoppers avoid them and prefer well-arranged product pages.

**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers need to create easy-to-understand titles instead of filling them with multiple keywords.¬†

A title that helps buyers solve purchasing decisions should include the main keyword once with supporting product information to explain what the product offers. This method makes listings more visible to customers so they can shop without obstacles.

# Integrate Your Main Keywords Naturally into Product Titles

Amazon gives sellers set character limits for product titles throughout different selling categories. Sellers should choose their main keywords carefully and use these terms normally throughout the product title. The best product titles need to display core item information in an easier-to-understand format.

* When selling wireless earbuds the seller should name the listing as ‚ÄúNoise Canceling Wireless Earbuds with Our WiFi Bluetooth 5.3 and 40-Hour Battery and Waterproof Protection‚Äù. The title easily shows all main product benefits through its normal writing style.
* The product title ‚ÄúWireless Earbuds Noise Cancelling Bluetooth Earbuds Waterproof Long Battery Life Best Wireless Earphones‚Äù includes so many keywords that they become difficult to understand. The usage of these terms causes information to unfold in an illogical order. The customer cannot easily find what makes the product special which hurts website traffic and sales.

Your content becomes simpler to understand and better matches search results when you stick to core keywords.¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers need to form titles that replicate the actual search terms potential Amazon buyers use when looking for items.

# Avoid Repeating Keywords Unnecessarily

Adding keywords multiple times in product names and product texts does not make¬†[Amazon search rankings](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-use-search-frequency-rank-to-maximize-conversions-on-amazon/)¬†better. The Amazon algorithm finds corresponding words so featuring the same keyword repeatedly in your title harms natural writing quality.

When selling an organic cotton baby onesie the seller should write a title named ‚ÄúOrganic Cotton Baby Onesie with Soft Breathable Hypoallergenic Fabric.‚Äù The title clearly states all necessary information to customers in an easy-to-read style.

* The title ‚ÄúBaby Onesie Organic Cotton Baby Onesie Soft Baby Onesie Hypoallergenic‚Äù repeats the same keyword phrase too many times. Following this technique decreases visibility by making the title hard to read and decreasing customer trust.¬†

Consumers want easy-to-understand listing formats and avoid shopping items with unnecessary repeating texts.

When creating product titles sellers need to use different wording combinations to help search engines find their items while making the titles easy to understand.

¬†They should use matching synonyms along with specific descriptions of the product features. Our listing becomes more enjoyable to read and attracts perfect customers through this approach.

# Keep Titles Direct And Easy To Follow In Their Current Word Order

A product title needs to display its logic in human-understandable order. Because Amazon users browse quickly through titles sellers should design an organized information display for shoppers to understand. When keywords are strung together unrelatedly it creates confusion for buyers and diminishes their purchase decisions.

A selling listing for an electric standing desk should feature the title ‚ÄúElectric Standing Desk Combines Adjustable Height, Generous Workspace, and Durable Construction.‚Äù The title format starts with the product name then lists its main advantages.

* An effective title should follow an easy-to-understand pattern but the ‚ÄúStanding Desk Electric Adjustable Height Desk Home Office Desk Sturdy Work Desk‚Äù name does not achieve this. The chosen words make sense but putting them together in this way causes reading challenges. Most customers would have difficulties reading and understanding the product attributes which impacts their buying decision.

Using a clear word arrangement lets shoppers understand product details better while making the text easier to understand. Sellers need to build their titles using normal conversational patterns so buyers can easily locate and understand their product listings.

# Create Readable Bullet Points By Using Keywords Carefully

Bullet points on Amazon support product description for customers. Putting excessive keywords into product text makes it hard to read.¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers need to draft bullet points that concisely show what the product does better than standard keyword use.

To optimize their bookshelf product listing on Amazon the seller should use this bullet point strategy.

* ‚ÄúSpacious Storage: 4-tier bookshelf with adjustable shelves for home and office.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúDurable Material: Sturdy metal frame with wood shelves for long-lasting use.‚Äù

This technique delivers straightforward details that do not need excessive keyword usage.

A keyword-stuffed product description appears as follows.

* ‚ÄúBookshelf Wooden Bookshelf Storage Shelf Adjustable Bookshelf Office Bookshelf‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSturdy Bookshelf Metal Bookshelf Durable Bookshelf Home Bookshelf‚Äù

This version makes it hard to understand and fails to benefit the customer. The target audience needs to read each point fast so excessive text distracts them from the listing. Your description should include suitable keywords that feel normal to read.

# Write Natural-Sounding Product Descriptions

Your¬†[product descriptions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katelee/2012/11/28/how-to-spruce-up-your-ecommerce-product-descriptions/)¬†should create compelling content before loading them with keyword phrases. When¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers repeatedly integrate different variations of keywords it reduces their product descriptions‚Äô readability and harms their sales success.

A seller should describe their stainless steel cookware set as built to survive and maintain even cooking temperatures. The special coating helps food slide off the pan and gives simple cleaning results.

* This cookware set of stainless steel materials offers superior cooking functions of all cookware sets. The description highlights benefits of stainless steel cookware with non-stick and durable material construction. feels unnatural and repetitive. The unhelpful content prevents the website from better interacting with visitors.

Customers want to read descriptions that offer valuable details instead of repetition with product keywords. Sellers need to highlight the advantages of their products and demonstrate what makes them stand out within their normal verbalization of keywords.

# Withstand Amazon‚Äôs Listing Control System When You Stick to Their Rules

Amazon imposes keyword standards that can hurt seller listings when sellers break them. Putting too many keywords into your¬†[product listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-keywords-research-tool-wordspy/)¬†will hurt your chances of being seen or even cause Amazon to take down your listing. Sellers must follow the official structure rules Amazon provides for their listings.

A seller who observes Amazon text character limits and keeps descriptions easy to understand will keep their listing visible in market competition. The Amazon system marks seller accounts for rule breaking whenever product titles and descriptions contain numerous unnecessary keywords.

Amazon demands specific criteria that sellers must follow plus easy-to-read text in order to succeed in the long run. A product listing should make shopping easier to use while naturally adding keywords to its content. Enhanced rankings and improved sales performance will help sellers grow their Amazon brand effectively.

# Shift Your Marketing Efforts From Keyword Selection Towards Customer Benefit Description

When buying on Amazon most customers search for results based on specific needs, not just particular words within product details.

¬†Brands should put their focus on describing customer benefits rather than using various keyword versions in their listings. Customers are more likely to make a purchase when they grasp the product benefits.

* The seller of ergonomic office chairs should compose this statement: ‚ÄúThis ergonomic office chair relieves back pressure and offers height-adjustable arms for pleasant work hours.‚Äù Through this sentence the product displays its benefits for customers.
* The text featuring overly repeated office chair terms appears as follows: ‚ÄúOffice chair ergonomic chair lumbar support office chair best office chair for working chair adjustable chair.‚Äù The sentence repeats different forms of ‚Äúoffice chair‚Äù yet remains unclear to readers. Many customers would find it hard to see what makes this chair stand above others.

When sellers list product benefits instead of keyword repetition they produce content that will interest more customers. Our method brings in more customers without sacrificing the professional and useful tone.

# Replace Traditional Keywords With Their Functional Synonyms

The Amazon system identifies word alternatives so¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers can provide their main keyword once without repetition. In each listing we should replace multiple identical keywords with natural language and synonymic terms to make content more interesting and readable.

The seller describes their product as a cooling gel memory foam pillow to ensure deep sleep. The sentence directly uses the main keyword but also lists the product specifics at the same time.

A shredded memory foam sleeping pillow ranks highest among memory foam pillows for sleep. This sentence doubles up on the term ‚Äòmemory foam pillow‚Äô which makes the text hard to follow.

When picking alternative words our aim is to make listings easy to read without sacrificing essential keyword placement. Amazon‚Äôs search algorithm handles multiple phrases so sellers should make their product information easy to read and follow.

*Explore More:*¬†[*Is Your Amazon Listing Missing the Power of 3D Product Images*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/is-your-amazon-listing-missing-the-power-of-3d-product-images/)

# Keep Your Product Titles Direct By Avoiding Repetitive Keyword Inclusion

Sellers add several product search words to their title in order to increase visibility but it creates a long and hard-to-read text. Your product title should convey helpful information first instead of serving as a keyword collection.

* A vacuum cleaner seller should name their product as ‚ÄúCordless Vacuum Cleaner for Strong Suction and 60 Minutes of Battery Use.‚Äù
* You can see search term stuffing in an underperforming product title that reads ‚ÄúCordless Vacuum Cleaner Best Cordless Vacuum for Pet Hair and Hardwood Carpets on Carpets and Hardwood.‚Äù The text contains a large number of keywords that do not help readers understand it better.

When customers see a neat title they are more likely to click on a product which improves the performance of search results. Include only important facts when creating your title because adding random keywords will damage its effectiveness.

# Move Keywords to Search Terms Area Rather than Force-Fitting Them Into Listing Content

Amazon gives sellers an option to add more search terms into the product listing backend without damaging text legibility. Sellers can enhance their search engine rankings by using more keywords because this information goes into invisible backend search terms.

* The seller of vacuum cleaners should list search terms like ‚Äúvacuum cleaner‚Äù plus ‚Äústick vacuum‚Äù plus ‚Äúpet hair vacuum‚Äù plus ‚Äúhardwood floor vacuum‚Äù in their product settings.
* A title that fails to perform well includes both ‚ÄúVacuum Cleaner‚Äù and ‚ÄúHardwood Vacuum Cleaner Stick Vacuum Pet Hair.‚Äù When a title becomes difficult to read it also diminishes our confidence in the listing.

Sellers can enhance their search position through proper backend terms setup without hurting how users interact with the product. By implementing this method sellers keep their listings professional yet get more buyers to see them on Amazon.

# Do Not Choose Keywords That Incorrectly Describe Your Product

Some vendors insert generic keywords into their item details that are unrelated to their actual products. Amazon may reduce the seller‚Äôs listing presence when users experience bad results from misleading keywords.

* The seller of vegan leather handbags should describe their product as ‚ÄúStylish Durable Lightweight Vegan Handbag.‚Äù The title provides an exact portrayal of what the product offers.
* The buyer feels misled when the product is not luxury or designer due to deceptive keywords ‚ÄúVegan Leather Handbag Luxury Designer Bag Louis Style Expensive Handbag.‚Äù Customers who feel deceived will create bad feedback and may ask for a refund.

Amazon removes listings from sellers who provide inaccurate keywords so use keywords that match each product details correctly. When product descriptions use truthful terms customers develop trust and the brand succeeds over time.

# Avoid Using Special Letters And Letter Casing Too Much In Your Product Descriptions

Excessive use of caps and special symbols hurts the professional image of your listing.¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should avoid using all caps or additional punctuation since it typically looks like spam advertising.

* The seller should write ‚ÄúNoise Cancelling Bluetooth Headphones with 30-Hour Battery.‚Äù
* An incorrect wireless headphone title reads as WIRELESS BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES The best headphones for blocking noise offer an uninterrupted 30-hour audio experience. The listing looks unreliable and users will not click because of this appearance.

When Amazon sellers fail to follow their official title standards they may face actions. Sellers need to normalize verbalization and normalize verbalization when typing titles while showing clear writing and easy reading.

# Use Titles That Stay Within Character Limits So Viewers Can Easily Identify Them

Selections of products have fixed text limits for their product titles that differ across product categories on Amazon. Long titles override search result information making them perform poorly for customers. Make sure product titles stay within the designated character limit structure to help customers find you.

* The seller presents the air purifier as a home device with HEPA filter for dust and allergen removal. Air Purifier produces the best performance when it uses ‚ÄúHEPA air filter‚Äù keywords to remove contaminants from home spaces. This title becomes unreadable when shown on search results. Simple and easy-to-read titles help customers find the most valuable details faster.

# Check And Adjust Product Listings Based On Their Success Numbers

Sellers need to study their listings frequently to check which search terms bring the highest number of sales. Through experiments they can study multiple title and description formats to find ones that generate best results.

* When examining sales results the seller finds that ‚Äúcordless stick vacuum‚Äù matches customer needs better than ‚Äúcordless vacuum cleaner.‚Äù They can modify their product title according to these findings.

**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should depend on facts about actual performance instead of randomly including keywords in their product listings. Periodic testing of product listings helps sellers raise their search position and boost revenue.

# Avoiding the Use of Amazon Unapproved Bundles for ASIN Listings

# Sellers Need To Know Amazon‚Äôs Bundle Policy To Stay Within Its Rules

Amazon requires sellers to comply with clear bundle product standards or their listings will face suppression. A bundle contains multiple related items that provide enhanced benefits to customers. Amazon disallows item groupings that happen randomly or make misleading claims about products.

* Amazon does not object to sellers posting packages using matching gadgets like ‚ÄúLaptop + Wireless Mouse + Keyboard‚Äù because buyers typically get them as a group.
* The ‚ÄúLaptop + Coffee Mug + Headphones‚Äù bundle would certainly qualify as an unapproved bundle because these items share no meaningful connection benefits. When sellers bring unassociated items together they face removal of their listings plus encounter customer dissatisfaction which results in negative feedback.

*Explore More:*¬†[*5 Points Guide to Amazon Buy Box in 2019*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-buy-box/)

# Bundles Need to Deliver Real Value to Their Customers

To qualify as a bundle Amazon sets strict rules that products must add specific advantages to customer use. Haphazard product combinations cannot serve as bundles for profit boosting purposes. The bundle needs to include helpful related items that improve the customer‚Äôs experience.

* The combination of 3 phone protection items in a bundle named ‚ÄúSmartphone + Screen Protector + Phone Case‚Äù makes sense since buyers get essential phone accessories at once.

The connection between a smartphone and USB cable plus a water bottle does not create an edition Amazon prohibits selling irrelevant bundles that decrease sales performance and our policy compliance.

# Never Combine Pre-Packaged Manufacturer Sets Into Your Bundles

Amazon prohibits sellers from transforming manufacturer product sets into their own bundled packages. The brand decides how sold products are bundled and sellers must keep those sets intact.

The complete accessory kits supplied by Canon for their DSLR cameras cannot be distributed through separate bundles by Amazon sellers.

A LEGO set with several mini-figure elements in one box must remain intact because you cannot split up these elements into separate bundles containing figures from various other sets. When you alter original packaging your product may be removed from Amazon‚Äôs system and your selling account could be disabled.

# Every Bundled Product Needs Its Own Distinct ASIN Identification

Amazon mandates that bundled products get new unique ASINs for bundling rather than borrowing ASINs from its components. Sellers need to choose a new ASIN for their bundle rather than using the main product ASIN.

* A seller must establish a fresh ASIN for their bundle when it contains three items ‚Äì a gaming laptop plus mouse plus keyboard.

Amazon detects bundle policy issues when a seller lists only the laptop ASIN because it displays an incorrect product range.

Place product bundles in the right product category according to the main item within the package. Amazon demands bundle listing happen according to the main product contained in each shipment. Sellers need to put their product bundle under a category matching its true nature to follow policy rules.

* When selling a bundle of ‚ÄúMirrorless Camera + Extra Battery + SD Card‚Äù Amazon will recognize the camera as the main product. The bundle must display under Cameras &¬†[Product Photography](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/inside-look-why-amazon-product-photography-is-the-game-changer-you-didnt-know-you-needed/)¬†since it includes a primary camera product.

The platform could take down listings from sellers when wrong categories are used for product display such as ‚ÄúElectronics Accessories.‚Äù

# Make Sure Bundle Descriptions Show Exactly What The Bundle Contains

The product bundle information needs to show exactly what products buyers receive in the package. Customers must receive all important details about items during their buying decision.

The listing should mention all included items such as a ‚ÄúGaming Console with 2 Controllers plus Charging Dock‚Äù pack.

* When a retailer fails to clearly describe all included products in a bundle advertised as ‚ÄúGaming Console Ultimate Set‚Äù it leads to unwanted public feedback and breaks Amazon‚Äôs rules.

# Stay Away From Putting Prohibited Items Into Your Product Bundles

Amazon permits sales combinations that include specific products in their bundle restrictions. These include:

* Digital products or subscriptions (e.g., an ebook with a physical book)
* The policy restricts selling knives with camping tents together as hazardous products.
* Combining products from various brands that do not fit well together

A bundle pairing protein powder from one brand with dumbbells sold under another cannot work properly because they are from different brands and product lines.¬†

The bundle of protein powder and shaker bottle works well since customers often buy these items as part of a complete meal replacement routine.

# Keep Your Bundle Prices Follow Amazon‚Äôs Distribution Guidelines

Amazon wants packages to give customers more useful offers than inflated prices. Packaging items together cannot make sellers raise prices artificially.

* The bundle should be sold at $13-$15 when two items such as a coffee mug priced at $10 and a coffee spoon costing $5 are included in one purchase. Amazon will likely investigate the pricing when this bundle costs more than $25 and $30.

I (34 F) met my wife (33 y/o) back in 2018 when she started her medical residency. Even though her family is rich and she was raised with everything, she decided not to ask them anything during that period and residents earn very little money. 
So I was working as a Project Analyst, and my money was just enough. She spent most of her time in my apartment because it was always clean and I always had food. Basically, I washed her clothes, paid for food, rent, washed her shoes, all house bills were super high because of air conditioning and all. 
I got laid off twice during those massive layoff waves and had to use my economies and even made a loan (which I regret because I still didn‚Äôt paid).
She finished residency and asked me to marry her, which I accepted. I thought we would do something small but she decided to go for a big party. I became unemployed but was still making money from consulting services I provided and every single penny made, I deposited into her account because I suck at managing my money. 
My consulting services would make $7k to $8k every month. This was 2023 and as a specialist doctor, the month she worked less, she made $50k. When her agenda was full, she made $80k. 
She was always complaining on how my money was the same as nothing and that she was paying house bills and the wedding by herself and that she didn‚Äôt even want the party.
She loved the party but that‚Äôs still an issue. Now, I‚Äôm employed again and contributing with $ 12 k every month, while her earnings are around $ 100 k. 
I pay half of all bills, which is around $4k every month. I pay for food, we have a house cleaner who comes twice a week and all cleaning products are paid by me as well as her payments. I manage the house in general, I manage her office and I have a full time job and I‚Äôm a doctoral candidate. I still do laundry and wash her shoes. 
Even after all this time, she complains my money doesn‚Äôt help much and that she‚Äôs tired of working so much just for paying bills. She got a new car (mine is 12 years old), brand new apple products, expensive clothes and shoes‚Ä¶I do home office so I don‚Äôt buy many clothes. 
I told her I feel it‚Äôs unfair to listen all of this from her and still paying half of everything when she actually makes more money and should contribute with the largest sum. She felt offended and bursted about how she paid the whole wedding and etc when I was unemployed. For the first time I exploded and kind of threw at her everything I‚Äôve been doing for her all these years and that she makes more money now and always will so she should stop complaining and either accepting that she must contribute with the largest sum or we should go separate ways.

TRIGGER WARNING: mentions threats of self-harm

Hey everyone. It's been a while. Alot has happened in the past week of me getting space from my bf since I have made the post.

TLDR; My bf walked in on me pleasuring myself and raged, accusing me of cheating simply because I'm apparently not allowed to orgasm unless he's responsible for it. He escalated the situation by going through my phone, policing my clothing and harassing my friends.

Before the update on the talk... let me tell you what exactly he's been doing since I posted.

During this break he has escalated further. He refused to accept this break and behaved like I commited a crime. He stalked me, checked my location and questioned everywhere I went, over 70 missed calls and texts ranging from crying and begging, to saying vile and low things about my insecurities, to threatening to unalive himself.

I ended up turning off my location and blocking him. He showed up at my door almost every night. After work wasn't so bad because I could avoid being home then and just be home during the day but on his days off it was hell. I told him I would call the police if he didn't leave. He did eventually leave. The last day and a half has been quiet-ish. 

The reason for this crashout was basically because he thought I wanted a break to have an excuse to cheat on him with some side dude that he thinks I have.

Now for the talk:

I asked to meet at the coffee place (at a time when it was busy). He agreed. My sister went to sit at a table behind him at a distance.
When we sat down he looked at me kind of like... smug??? He said he's waiting. I asked him ""for what""? And he said an apology. Obviously I was confused and he said I needed to apologise for abandoning him the whole week.

I told him that he was being ridiculous and we need to talk about the whole masturbation thing. He wouldn't go past the week break thing. I could feel my blood boil so I just told him that I'm not sorry for needing space from someone who has been so abusive and controlling towards me. 
He told me that abusive is a harsh way to describe it and he wouldn't have needed to if I just didn't do it and didn't take a break.

I asked him did he just want me to be a doormat and just take his verbal abuse, stalking and controlling behaviour?
He avoided answering the question so I just repeated it over and over and over and over and over.
Eventually he admitted that ""you're the woman. You do what I say and why do you need to masturbate anyway? Do I not do enough? You stepped out of line so I need to discipline you. That's what all of this is and you tried to run from it by taking a break. You should have known that I was trying to show you where you went wrong so this doesn't happen again."" (Paraphrasing)

I almost threw up.
I told him that he's not my father he can't ""discipline me"". And once AGAIN that masturbating isn't cheating. Women have needs and he is not the center of my universe. What he has been doing is flat out abuse. I said I thought I was with a guy that didn't believe in that red pill bs of ""you have female parts = do what man says"" but he has lied to me this whole time. Then I asked him if he's been listening to T*te type of podcasts because the switch makes no sense.

He got angry at that and raised his voice. I didn't even register what he said because he hit the table with his fist and went off on me. People looked at us and the server just came to ask if everything is ok. He told the server everything is fine then i saw my sister walking towards us. She took my bag and said we're leaving. I literally got up so fast I almost knocked the table over and he grabbed my arm. He pulled me and screamed at my sister until others intervened. 

I was already crying at this point and when I got free of his grip I screamed back that I'm done with him. I'll leave his shit outside my door but I'm breaking up with him. I can't do this anymore. He tried to follow us but other guys at the coffee place held him and we left. 

I have him blocked on everything but random numbers are calling me. I'm with my sister at her place. She helped me write this. I'm still shaking because my anxiety is through the roof. I can't really understand why it had to be this way.

I'm still an emotional mess. I know it won't end here so... if you have any advice on how to get someone like this to leave me alone please let me know. The police is useless and an RO can't stop an aggressive 6'2 grown man. I'm 5'2 and need all the help I can get. My friends are trying to talk him down but it doesn't seem to be working. Please.

I was desperate to become a doctor. But every time I got past 3rd year, I experienced a colossal amount of racism from the staff. The most vicious type.

  
They gave me fake exams. This made me SO depressed, I instantly ran out of energy after lectures, instantly, I had to drink 5 cups of coffee in one go daily just to have the energy to attend lectures on time. It tasted so raw. 

The staff accused me of things I never did. They did this so they could make an excuse to discipline me a lot. Whilst I was studying, they were constantly planning to remove my career. They got every single staff member to shout at specifically me. They did this by e-mailing each of them to target me (this is literally how evil my university was). I never knew that I should have informed the medical defence union. The university made sarcastic jokes in every hearing. They had no fear.

  
I never experienced such intense discrimination. Some staff even threatened that they would break my face because they knew boxing. At the time, I never knew that I should have told the police.

  
I started phoning Samaritans, and Samaritans started telling my university that I was depressed. The Samaritans framed it so sarcastically, that my university showed me their reports with a grin on their face. I never knew that racism was so intense that even the Samaritans were trying to remove me from Medical school.

The thing that broke my heart was when my girlfriend started shouting at me as if she was racist. She was of my own race. My university obviously swooped in like an eagle and capitalised on that situation, and removed me from the course. I never understood why my girlfriend had such severe mental health. I was so sympathetic to her. But my university never gave me a chance. Now I cannot look at people without remembering how much hatred they have for me. I recently read in a news article how a nurse of my race almost got beaten to death out of racism. 

Personally, I feel very negative. I gave too many years of my life away. I want to be optimistic, but I am so sad. I worked hard my entire life. I am treated like filth now.",1,1743530114.0,depression,0,1.0,False

The difference in brew (using same washed Salvadoran beans from RogueWave) was obvious. 

The brew was was not only sweeter but the floral notes hit me in the face - not necessarily in a good way. 

The notes reminded me of a ladies scented bathroom soap or heavy air freshener or, for the few pipe smokers out there, an English Lakeland Pipe tobacco, famous for ""is it soapy or is it floral?"" debates. 

But I am taking my time and am happy to pick up new notes that previously escaped me completely. The floral notes are growing on me.

------------------------------------------------------

Blue barndominium designs have surged in popularity thanks to their unique blend of modern aesthetics and rustic charm. These homes stand out for their eye-catching blue exterior, often complemented by unique finishes and materials that enhance their character. Let‚Äôs explore some of the distinctive features that make blue barndominiums an enticing choice for homeowners.

One of the best aspects of blue barndominiums is their customizable designs. You can tailor the layout and interior based on your preferences. This flexibility allows you to create a space that feels uniquely yours. Here are some common features that can make your blue barndominium stand out:

- **Open floor plans:** Most blue barndominiums embrace open layouts. This design style helps create a spacious feeling, making it great for gatherings and family activities.
- **Large windows:** Big, beautiful windows let in plenty of natural light. They not only brighten up the space but also enhance the outdoor views, making the home feel connected to its surroundings.
- **Eco-friendly materials:** Many modern barndominiums use sustainable materials. Choosing eco-friendly options can lower your carbon footprint while creating a stylish and unique home.
- **High ceilings:** A common design element in barndominiums, high ceilings add to the sense of space. You can also incorporate loft areas for additional storage or leisure spots.
- **Mixed materials:** Blue barndominiums often combine various materials, such as wood, metal, and stone. This mix adds texture and depth, creating a visually appealing home.

Another standout feature is the durable construction typical of barndominiums. Built primarily with steel and other robust materials, these homes are designed to withstand the elements. This durability ensures that your blue barndominium will stand the test of time, providing a long-lasting living space.

The unique color of the blue exterior is not just for aesthetics. Choosing a bold color like blue can express your personality and set your home apart from traditional houses in your neighborhood. The calming tone of blue also evokes feelings of tranquility and connection to nature, which can enhance your living experience.

In addition to the structural and aesthetic features, blue barndominiums often include outdoor living spaces. Imagine enjoying your morning coffee on a spacious porch or hosting a barbeque with friends. Adding a deck or patio not only extends your living area but can also create a stunning visual contrast against the blue exterior.

When it comes to interior design, blue barndominiums provide a blank canvas. Homeowners can play with various design styles, from modern farmhouse to industrial chic. Here are some ideas for decorating your blue barndominium's interior:

- **Rustic elements:** Incorporate wooden beams, reclaimed wood furniture, or stone accents to keep the rustic charm alive.
- **Bright accents:** Use bright colors as interior accents that complement the blue exterior. Items like cushions, rugs, or art pieces can bring a lively touch to your home.
- **Functional spaces:** Create multipurpose rooms where you can work, relax, or entertain. This versatility is crucial in maximizing the usability of your space.

As you envision your blue barndominium, consider how each element contributes to the overall feel of the home. Lighting choices can also play a significant role. Pendant lights, chandeliers, or large floor lamps can enhance various spaces while adding a stylish vibe.

Landscaping around your blue barndominium can further elevate its charm. Thoughtfully planned gardens, pathways, and outdoor seating areas can create a cohesive look that draws attention to your unique home.

Blue barndominium designs bring together a range of unique features that cater to modern needs while maintaining a connection to tradition. With customizable layouts, durable materials, and beautiful aesthetics, these homes are genuinely a cool and unique choice for anyone looking to build or renovate. Whether you live in the country or the city, a blue barndominium can be a stunning and functional option.

Practical Advantages of Choosing a Barndominium as Your Home
------------------------------------------------------------

When considering a unique and practical living space, barndominiums stand out as a fantastic option. They blend the charm of a barn with the comforts of a home. If you‚Äôre contemplating what makes this modern architectural choice trendy, here are some compelling reasons to think about choosing a barndominium as your home.

One major advantage of barndominiums is their affordability. Typically, building a barndominium costs less than traditional homes. This is largely due to their simpler construction process and the lower cost of materials. Steel structures, often used in barndominiums, provide strength and durability while remaining cost-effective. The savings extend to maintenance expenses, making it a budget-friendly option overall.

Another practical advantage is their spacious layout. Barndominiums offer an open floor plan, giving you ample room to design the interior according to your preferences. Whether you prefer a cozy living area or an expansive kitchen, the flexibility in designing your space is an undeniable benefit. You have the freedom to create separate living zones while maintaining an open, airy feel.

Energy efficiency is also a key factor in choosing a barndominium. These structures often include high ceilings and large windows, allowing for better natural lighting and ventilation. This can help reduce energy costs by lowering the need for artificial lighting and heating during the day. Moreover, you can easily install energy-efficient appliances and systems that further enhance energy savings.

The versatility of a barndominium is another highlight. You can customize it for various uses beyond just living space. Many homeowners incorporate workshops, guest suites, or even home businesses within their barndo. By blending residential and functional spaces, you maximize the usability of your property, allowing for unique lifestyle choices tailored to your needs.

Safety and resilience are important factors when making a home choice. Barndominiums are constructed with steel, making them fire-resistant and immune to issues like termites. This reduces the risk of costly repairs over time and provides a greater sense of security for your family. The robust structure is designed to withstand severe weather conditions, adding peace of mind to your living environment.

In terms of construction time, barndominiums are usually quicker to build than traditional homes. Since many designs use prefabricated materials, the assembly process can be significantly streamlined. This means you can move in sooner and start enjoying your new home without a long wait, making it a convenient choice for those on a timeline.

Here‚Äôs a list summarizing some practical advantages of choosing a barndominium:

- **Cost-Effective:** Less expensive to construct and maintain.
- **Spacious Layout:** Open floor plans allow for flexible designs.
- **Energy Efficient:** Natural lighting and ventilation reduce energy expenses.
- **Versatile Use:** Suitable for living space and functional areas.
- **Durable Materials:** Steel structures resist damage from fire and pests.
- **Quick Construction:** Faster build times thanks to prefabricated materials.

In terms of aesthetics, a barndominium can be personalized to fit your style perfectly. With options for siding materials, roof styles, and interior finishes, you can design a space that truly feels like home. Whether you lean toward rustic charm or modern elegance, the visual appeal of your barndominium can reflect your unique taste.

Moreover, barndominiums often come with the added benefit of breathtaking views. Many are constructed on large plots of land, allowing homeowners to enjoy beautiful natural surroundings. This connection to nature enhances the overall living experience, promoting a sense of peace and relaxation.

Barndominiums can foster a sense of community and belonging. Many people who choose this style of home settle in rural or semi-rural areas where neighbors are friendly and supportive. Establishing relationships with your community can significantly improve your quality of life and create a positive environment for your family.

Choosing a barndominium offers practical advantages that cater to modern living. From cost efficiency and spacious designs to energy savings and community, these unique homes provide lifelong benefits. If you are looking for an innovative and practical solution for your next home, consider the barndominium as your choice.

### Conclusion

As we dive into the world of blue barndominium designs, it‚Äôs clear that these homes stand out as a unique blend of modern aesthetics and practical living. The vibrant blue exterior offers not only a striking visual appeal but also provides a sense of freshness and creativity that can transform any landscape. Whether you're drawn to the rustic charm or contemporary flair, these designs can personalize your living space in a way that traditional homes often can't.

Choosing a barndominium brings numerous practical advantages. Their spacious interiors are perfect for families or individuals who value open-concept living. Plus, the cost-effectiveness of barndominiums, from reduced construction expenses to lower utility costs, makes them an attractive option for many. The durability of the materials used in blue barndominium designs ensures long-lasting quality, saving you time and money on maintenance.

Moreover, the versatility of the layouts allows for customization to suit your unique lifestyle, whether it‚Äôs a cozy family retreat or an entertainment haven. With energy-efficient features and the potential for sustainable building practices, barndominiums redefine what it means to build your dream home.

Ultimately, embracing a blue barndominium design means choosing a beautiful, efficient, and highly customizable living space. This distinctive choice not only reflects your personal style but also offers a welcoming atmosphere for friends and family alike. If you're considering a new home, exploring blue barndominiums as a viable option could lead you to the perfect sanctuary that meets both your practical needs and aesthetic desires.",1,1743529364.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

1jp1m25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusVisa/comments/1jp1m25/looking_at_potentially_coming_over_wanting_to_get/,"Looking at potentially coming over, wanting to get some opinions","I find myself in a strange position. With the social and political climate of the US, I'm not so sure I like this timeline. I understand every city and every country has its up and downs, and has a political left and right, but compared to how things are in the US, it just feels extreme and unreasonable here.

I am 39 years old with 15 years in network engineering and a dab of cybersecurity as a government contractor in enterprise systems. I am married with no kids, in good health, no criminal record, and I possess a US clearance. I don't say all this to brag, I just feel like I would be a positive contributor to society.

It also seems like browsing various AUS subreddits, and their perspective cities, that the IT job market is in a poor state. At the same time, it seems like most of the people wanting in are junior or fresh out of college SWE's. Neither is the case for me and I'm hoping my experience will help me out here. I also understand the housing market is wild. However, after researching NZ, AUS, Ireland, and UK subs, this seems to be universal.

So why Aus? I have a cousin who lives with and is married to an Aus citizen in Adelaide. I was fortunate enough to visit Adelaide and Melbourne for a couple days each, and I LOVED IT! I know, I know, vacationing isn't the same thing as living. But as someone who doesn't know any other language than English, Aus seemed like an easy choice. I am also a coffee fiend.

What I am not sure of and looking to get some ideas about:

*   If I strive to get a skilled migrant visa, and thus need an employer to sponsor me, is it feasible to achieve this while offshore still living in the US? I am sure it depends on the company, but what is the turnaround time expected for someone in my position? Like ""Okay Mr. SyrioBroel, we will offer you $X on Y start date"". If I need the job offer to get a visa, how can we possibly determine start date Y if I have to apply for said visa first?

* On the subject of visas, since my occupation appears to be part of the skilled listed as an MLTSSL, ANZSCO 263111, there are a few dozen types of visas that can fall under that. Does one type of visa improve my chances over another? Does one have faster turnaround times, if I can achieve that?

* Lastly on visas, my wife is a person of color who is a stay at home housewife. We have been married only a couple months but living together for about 8 months. Should I wait another 4 months before even considering applying to anything, to meet the 12 month rule for her to get a partner visa?

*   I own property in the US and have a substantial 401k. Let's say hypothetically I eventually reach PR status in Aus. Is it better to liquidate all assets and transfer over after reaching PR? Before? This may be a lawyer question.

*   Assuming I can actually land a job offer in more than one city, is one city better overall for someone who enjoys mild weather and boutique/local shop browsing? Does one city have better ISP availability / reliable internet? Which city has the best public transportation and least crime? My wife and I don't care too much about nightlife but going out dancing a couple times a year is something we do.

*   I have found tons of apartments for rent on real estate websites, but is it true that the rental price for these is negotiable? If so, does that mean most are privately owned? I've rented apartments most of my life in the US and the rent was never negotiable when they're listed by a company lol.

At the time she was interested in a career change to an industry that my fiance happened to be in, so they got connected and he helped her get an interview at his company.

We've all become good friends since, and learned that she has ADHD. 

Now the part that I don't know if it can be attributed to ADHD is that she doesn't seem to understand social boundaries. (I would also like to know if I'm overreacting here.) I genuinely don't think she does this intentionally or maliciously because she's done pretty socially unaware things with other guys (she's accidentally led on several just in the last year) but these are some of the things that have made me reconsider our relationship with her:
- invited him to Christmas/New Year's with her family when she found out I'd be away on a trip (but also invited me another time)
- invites him for dinner/lunch/coffee when I'm away (this she's done with both of us but it happens more often when i'm away)
- texts him to meet up for a chat when she happens to be in our area for an errand (never done this with me around, only ever happened when I was away on a trip)
- in a group setting during a trip where everyone was kinda hyped up and my fiance suggested an idea for another trip she replied, ""Yeah let's go baby!""
- calls him for work/relationship advice at random late hours
- gets touchy with him (like puts her hand on his shoulder sometimes) but she's way more touchy with me
- tried to insist on co-working with my fiance alone (we all work online) in his studio apartment while i was out on errands


They are from the same culture and my fiance is way more of an extrovert and generally just connects with people better than I do, so I get why she's more comfortable with him, and any time she does anything like the above, he turns her down gently or politely exits as soon as he can, and then tells me about it, and I've been writing all these things off as her just not understanding social boundaries or cues, but to what point and how do I confront her about this? Or am I overreacting and being too sensitive and should just be more patient with her? Could I continue writing all this off as her being ADHD? (I'm in the process of being diagnosed with.. something as well. We're actually on the same medication if that's at all relevant.)

But I also need to find a new way to move forward with my life and while my new illness probably pales in comparison to many, I hope maybe someone can help.

So... my life so far, I was always anxious even as a child, I just felt kind of lost, I remember not understanding what was happening when my mum threw me out of bed to take me to school, no one had explained what this place was or why I was leaving my comfy surroundings and I was always also basically, fairly lazy, while I loved the big garden we had and playing in it, when it came to going out the home, it was basically a bit of a chore, like an old person having to drag themselves out of a chair and staying home playing games or watching movies was where I was happiest... if someone would arrange something or drag me out, I'd have a good time, but under my own steam? Didn't happen much, just not the pop out sort, preferred my friends to come round to mine whenever possible.  
Even when it came to school, I think I learned how to fake illness at about 5 years old to avoid having to go because well, I didn't want to, didn't like it, feared this strange bleak place and people I couldn't connect with and liked playing with my toys at home.  
But overall? I wasn't unhappy, though I do remember feeling I couldn't speak up if there was a problem and had to hide my feelings.  
But I never wanted for anything and had a nice family. By all accounts, I had a decent start, far better than many are afforded and a relatively 'normal' childhood.  
  
Through my teens I managed to surround my self with a lot of friends from all walks of life, shed the more 'plain' friends I'd once had and have fun which then led to far-far too much partying and unfortunately I had the beginnings of a mild drinking problem, it didn't cause too much immediate damage but I now see started leading to poor choices and depressive behaviour which I suspect combined with the extra anxiety etc. it gave me, I ended up missing out on a lot of 'normal' life... while I did have a part time job for a couple of years, I probably could have had a couple of girlfriends that I desperately wanted, stop pretending to be something I absolutely wasn't and start on a better path but my poor self esteem and hangovers/depression/anxiety/laziness/poor friend choice were unbeknownst to me, ruining multiple chances... I would always waste time on the one I couldn't have instead of who was interested because I simply didn't see they were interested or getting drunk with friends took priority as I missed the blindingly obvious hint.  
I doubt many people were drinking a couple of beers most nights before school at 15, waking up mildly hungover after 5 hours sleep and feeling crap through lessons all day...   
But I certainly had a lot of fun, festivals, house party's, sunny days in the park drinking with friends, crazy adventures.

Despite my total lack of effort, being reasonably intelligent I passed my exams and then came time for university, but while my friends knew their path, I had no idea what I was doing, I always felt behind like that little kid dropped straight in to school all those years back and that I'd missed some guidance I should have had but didn't speak up, I just lied to my self instead and went with the crowd and assumed it'd work out...   
Around this time, my older brother had developed a serious drinking problem which obviously caused quite a lot of trauma despite me not realising it at the time, I was just pretending everything was fine, nothing was changing and trying to carry on partying as that's where I was happy so basically I got to university having picked something I just kind of thought would be fun and after the first night party, never attended a single class and sat in my dorm room hiding alone, drinking & gaming and avoiding any other soul... left after a few months before I had to pay for the year.   
Back home I'd just spend a lot of time pottering around waiting for friends to come back on break from uni so we could have BBQ's, Party's or whatever and usually lie that I was doing better for my self than I was... Mum tried to push me in to work but between drinking, my poor mental health and the fact I had never been on time for anything in my life so that went about as well as expected... Spent some time with the couple of people that didn't go elsewhere or get jobs but then with my brothers issues mounting at home, my mum had a breakdown, sold our house in our nice town (he went to live with his mentally unwell girlfriend who had been living with our nice little family and making us all unhappy for nearly 2 years) and we ended up living in various places while I was drinking, depressed and lonely, not knowing what to do with my self and unable to just 'pull my self together' and get a job or even explore the town, just spent the days in my room playing on my laptop and hiding away.

Eventually, my parents who were still struggling themselves and didn't really need me around decided to give me my inheritance early after a windfall and bought me a small flat back in my old town and I got to see all my old friends again, most were just leaving university and such, all getting small jobs, girlfriends and starting to plan their lives... I was living alone (although a good cook and knew how to take care of a home, something most of my friends had never learnt) and literally just scraping by doing whatever I could online for a pittance with my mild skill set and using the rest of my inheritance for the bills.   
Again, a lot of time spent in the pub with them drinking or just drinking at home, trying to self destruct...  
Once again though I made a lot of friends (having your own place at a young age certainly helps) had some good times again and finally managed to get my first proper girlfriend, she had also just been through a rather serious trauma and was quite the drinker too and not one for the outside world so we got on well, sitting at mine, a lot of tears and cuddling.

After the first year, she had to move back home and it became a long distance relationship, most of my thoughts were about her, she was all I wanted in life and that I needed to do better to keep her and unfortunately, this just mostly led to spiralling, depression and imposter syndrome... With an unpleasant curtain twitchy neighbour across the hall and an overly nosey community of acquantices (which didn't fit my feeling that my life had to be kept totally private and compartmentalised after hiding my brothers issues for so long and my own shame in what my life really was)  I eventually developed mild agoraphobia and cut my self off from most people and hated letting people in my house.

But I would fly over to see her when I could afford it, she started to get her life back together, she still drank a lot but got a job and with my support started to get her confidence back... I unfortunately, couldn't support my self and was spinning my wheels, knowing I was going to lose her, that how I presented my self was a lie but paralysed by fear trying to change anything (she wanted to meet my family, a totally normal request, I wanted her to as well, but after the past few years I just couldn't let anyone in to that world and she felt I was ashamed of her) so our relationship started to suffer and I focused on the wrong things thinking I was doing my best and not seeing why it didn't work... She also struggled to express her feelings and would often just shut me out for weeks at a time which would cause me extreme distress but I'd blame my self, feeling I deserved it and automatically forgiving her, so communication was not great between us....

I went on anti-depressants to try and improve and stop my spiralling, sold my flat for a nice profit and moved back with my parents, ready to 'make the jump' to live with her, hoping without the long distance and a fresh start for my self it could be fixed as we still got on nicely when together but it was too late by that point... not that I think I would have ever had the guts to move countries anyway, despite desperately wanting to be with her, I was lying to my self.  
I took the loss of my first and incredibly deep love about as well as you'd expect... It took at least 2 years to function again and stop sitting by the computer most evenings hoping she'd message me, wasting my life... a sad state for a 26 year old... we stayed friends and up until a couple of years back I'd visit once a year, both of us probably dragging out the pain but not knowing how to move on from our first loves.

I quit the anti-depressant realising it had simply numbed me to pain when I couldn't cry about the breakup and this is when I finally went to therapy (admittedly still hoping to fix my self just so she would want me back) it mainly dealt with how I felt at that moment, which I now realise was totally the wrong kind of therapy for me... but it did get me on my feet again briefly, I started looking for a new house but really, I was still a mess underneath the surface.  
One stressful house purchase falling through later, my brother having a severe relapse (we're talking yellow eye time) and moving in with us, shouting drunk and then screaming in pain from withdrawls... I was right back where I started.  
By this point my drinking was mainly under control (it was never anything like my brothers so I thought I didn't have a problem, not the best comparison...) I'd drink too much but I'd grown out of using it to self destruct and it would mostly be a once a week binge, it still made my anxiety crap for the whole week but my parents place was in the middle of nowhere and the local bar was really the only place I could find someone to talk to once a week, there were no places I could make real friends and I'd feel like my old ""happier"" self for a while... My mum would nag me about how I would afford to live in my new house and truthfully, I didn't know (I still did small online sales to buy my self clothes etc. and pay for beer without eroding my house cash but that was it) but building a life from where my parents lived was going to be impossible for me especially as I was and her stressing me out would just make me shut down and revert to poor coping mechanisms.

Struggled back out the hole again a bit then I finally found almost the perfect house in a town I was really looking forward to move to, I had no idea how I would afford to live in it but it was a start.  
It needed a lot of work but I was quite handy... but then it turned out it needed quite a lot more work than had been apparent... I used what money I had left to do the bigger jobs but then had to drive an hour each way to try and fix up the rest my self, for someone that hated driving and was depressed more often than not, this stretched out over 18 months.  
I knew I needed a job to pay to finish things, but even the thought of having to go to a job 9-5, five days a week, like a normal person threw me in to a panic, I knew I couldn't do it and even if I did, I'd soon fail and besides, I could talk my self out of it that It'd some how trap me and my house would lay abandoned so it was impossible.

Then life threw a new curveball, my dad quickly declined in to dementia and soon after, Covid hit.  
So I helped my mum with his care best I could, it was a gruelling stressful 5 years but my small online job started to make, while not masses of money, enough that I was going to finally be able to finish my house up and have enough to give starting a life in my new town a proper try once my dad had passed.  
I was going to quit the online job (I realised not interacting with anyone outside of my mum most days was not helping my mental health) get therapy and try and push my self to join the real world... Covid lockdowns had given me the breathing space to quit drinking, quit smoking and I started doing a little bit of exercise, I was never going to be a marathon runner or muscular, but I felt decent. It was finally going to be my time!  
My dad's situation had forced me to step up and grow up, I started to venture out a little, going with family to cafe's and parks, to the local shops just to look around once every couple of months and even started to cope with driving short distances now and then (despite it taking monumental effort to build up the courage). I became a better son, a better uncle, I even made friends with my future neighbours and popped round for a coffee when I was down doing a bit of painting...   
I knew deep down I was still broken and put on a front which wasn't healthy but I took on a fake it until I make it attitude so as not to appear a complete waste of humanity as that didn't seem a good way to make new friends...  
I planned a course of action, was looking at new avenues that might lead to meeting people and following some unmet dreams I'd always neglected for fear I would be a total failure or had not been offered the opportunities to take up so had not pursued for being too hard to achieve.  
I wasn't perfect, I slid back a lot, I struggled with old patterns but I was working on them in my own way (and considering the circumstances and extreme chronic stress...) I started to think while I wouldn't have a great life, with some therapy and a lot of work, I could have a decent and happy one even if I was a bit late starting, I for once started to think that reaching older age might actually not be so horrible, I'd see the world change, help guide my nieces and hopefully stop them making the mistakes I had and be there for them.



  
The Big Change...

\-------------------------------------------------



And then 3 months before my father passed, I got a virus... and that virus ate away at my inner ear... I developed severe tinnitus and a condition called 'hyperacusis' where your brain turns the gain up to compensate for hearing loss so noise causes pain... combined with my years of depression, health anxiety & general shitty mental health I am barely holding on and I am literally petrified of anything worsening it as I'm already suicidal even at this level and it literally has no limit as to how bad it can become if aggravated... eventually leading to neuralgia like pain and even a pillow brushing against the ear being unbearable.  
Every day my inner ear feels like a weeping scraped knee and you lose your tolerance for sound levels when you develop it, what for most people is day to day life of say, a police siren passing on the road next to them, a busy cafe or even a shop music system could worsen my condition permanently... even the coastal wind blowing in my ear is a risk... I have to wear ear defenders to the kitchen and can cope with one-to-one conversations but anything more and I require ear plugs... I daren't risk more than an hour car journey.  
Oh and anti-depressants will most likely worsen the already unbearable tinnitus so I am left with a brain that has spent years screwing me over to deal with this.

There is no cure, there is no treatment, you simply have to learn to live with it.  
I've tried a therapist and she has tried greatly to help me, but I can't see how to live a life like this... at present I can still enjoy some small comforts but any worsening and life may become an unimaginable hell and I am simply not cut out for it.

Despite years of punishing my body, I have never experienced any illness in life apart from normal colds and flu, I have lived by all accounts, a charmed life and undeserved health.  
Anything else in life could be treated or fixed, could be worked at, could be pushed through, could be overcome... If I try and push through this I'll potentially end up bed bound in constant untreatable agony.

I was finally going to give life a proper try, I look at my old school friends and peers, married, with children, in careers, achieving, happy, doing hobbies, still having adventures...   
True a career was never my dream and children I had long ago decided was not something I was going to be capable of fitting in to my life and that was fine.  
I just wanted a few friendly faces to see for a coffee at home or in a cafe and have some laughs, to cook them a meal, to go on a little trip to a park, watch a band, a bit of people watching and most of all someone to hold at night, sit in the garden with and experience some of lives little day to day joys together.  
But I now have no friends, no life, no prospects, can't do my old job, 34 years of baggage, fear sound itself and I'm effectively home bound, trapped in the life I'd fought to escape and in constant discomfort for the rest of my life, betrayed by one of my core senses... where on earth do I go from here?  
I've found my self laying on the sofa for months on end at my mothers, crying, my head droning at me 24/7 and wishing for death but knowing I haven't truly lived and finally realising after all this time that we only get one chance... and mine has been squandered, I could have made something of my self and been one of those happy healthy people with a few simple choices and a little work and avoided my current situation.

Ironically, that alcoholic brother has recovered and is currently finishing up my house for me so I can rent it out for an income... something many would kill for at my age but all I want is my old life of freedom.

I was afforded every chance but my brain wouldn't let me be happy and when it finally relented to let me try, my body's prevented me.

I want another go at life and I don't know what to do... I am weak, as you can see from my story, I've always taken the easy route, this time, there isn't one.

Some of you will understandably look at my story and think I'm a fucking idiot or spoiled man child given the pain and misfortune you've had thrust upon you but if all those years taught me anything it's that I've got to start being more honest to myself and others and I have to own it... 

Thank you for your time in advance.",1,1743528843.0,ChronicIllness,0,1.0,False

*January 2nd, 2084 - Georgetown, Atlantic Russian Republic*

""Long day today."" The Officer in his blue-jeans mused, occasionally checking over his shoulder as his partner walked back over with two cups of coffee. Soon both where leaning against the muddied car as the night sky rose once more over the Republic. 

""Quiet nowadays..."" The partner looked up to the streetlight which gave off the faintest purple hue. ""Maybe it's the lamp changes, purple's a calming colour y'know?"" 

The two laughed as they sipped the steaming cups in their hands, not noticing the young man walking towards them from across the street.

.............


""Mieszko! Come and play!"" The little girl playfully jeered as she held up her hands, raising them high in the sky. Beside her, the young man saw her brother, his face was just as excited as he reached for the toy in his pocket. ""Mieszko!""

The dry air and blue sky was a calming backdrop as the young man lifted up his hand, before patting the girl's head, feeling her hair in his hand. The little boy had fallen, sitting there on the ground looking up at him. 

""I'll help you up."" Mieszko extended his arm, taking the boy by the hand.

.............

""YARA!"" The male cop's voice was laced with fear as he watched the man's hand come crashing down through his partner's skull, grabbing a chunk of her hair before flinging the lifeless corpse to the side. He was forced to the ground, flat on his ass dodging his partner's body. Reaching for his sidearm, he raised the standard issue pistol towards the man standing above him. ""Yara!!!""

He lost focus for a mere moment as his eyes glanced to his dead partner, thinking about the son who just lost his mother. ""Fuck yo...""

His next words where exchanged for screams as the man grabbed his firing arm and ripped it from his body. The cop kept his eyes locked on the man in terror, as he tried to shuffle backwards along the ground, blood dripping from his limb. 

""We've a twenty-three nineteen! Twenty-three nineteen!"" He used his one good arm to manage his radio, while sirens began to ring across the city. ""One officer down, I repeat, officer down."" 

.............

The dry air had been replaced by rain which had soaked him to his bones. He could feel the wet on his hands as he looked to them. There was more kids now, as he played with them in the public park, each surrounding him in some game of tag. They where yelling at him, but he couldn't make out what they wanted.

Even in the brightest of sunshine, he could still vaguely make out his mom coming to get him. It must be supper time.

.............

""This is Colonel Aadan, 1st IORR, we're enroute to Georgetown now."" The Helldiver fastened his suit buckles, checking his power armor for the last time as he and his squad began final descent from the sky. Over the radio, various local policing forces could be heard trying to get clarification amidst the screams of agony. ""Yes, 1st IORR is being deployed, we're the closest max threat unit in the area."" 

Six Helldivers descended from the sky, their pods bursting to reveal a small plaza in Georgetown and a man covered in blood sat in the center, playing with human remains.

""This is Lieutenant Dakari of the UASR, you are being ordered to stand down!"" The Helldiver lieutenant raised his powered firearm, joined by five other barrels. There was no response from the man as he continued to play with his toys. 

Colonel Aadan wasn't taking any chances as he looked around and saw the carnage. ""Fire!"" 

.............

""Mieszko! It's time to come in for the night!"" He heard his mother's voice but didn't see her, though who was he to argue? 

""Okay mom, I'll be right in, just let me clean up."" Mieszko stood, putting his toys to the side.

""Don't forget to turn off the light."" His mom replied.

""Sure thing mom."" Mieszko raised his hand, pushing his finger on the switch that turned off the lights.

#Massacre of Georgetown: Doctors blame new disorder?

##Georgetown not the only case, says one Siberican researcher who claims ""cyberpsycho"" events increasing at a rapid pace across the globe.

----------

The Republic Issue | Issued January 12th, 2084  - 12:00 | Georgetown, Atlantic Russian Republic

----------

GEORGETOWN - What was once only a term for a fictional condition in various video-games and novels from the 2020s, has now become reality according to one Siberican researcher independently involved in the Georgetown investigation. While ""cyberpsychosis"" has yet to be officially recognized by any government or health body, a group of researchers that have been attached to the Georgetown case have begun using the term to describe specific cases of extremely violent crime waves. 

The most recent incident in Georgetown which required the deployment of 1st IORR who where in region due to the settling of the Brazilian Crisis is perhaps the highest profile incident in the last few years. Leaving over two dozen dead or injured, the event has been the most significant violent crime in Georgetown since the collapse of the Eastern Union. In said instance, one young Polish man identified as Mieszko who had immigrated from the Western Remnant of Russia went on a mass-killing spree. Local policing forces were unable to apprehend or terminate the subject in large part due to various artificial cyber-augments that the individual had installed through private aug-docs. 

While the disorder is not fully understood, the same researchers have thus far put forward the theory that increasing amounts of cybernetic augmentation onto the natural human frame, is causing a crash or lapse between the humanity and ""artificial"". Suggesting that those undergoing severe psychosis of this nature showcase extreme violent tendencies as a result of losing all human-connection both internally and externally. However the disorder is not yet understood and details remain emerging.

What is known however, is that similar cases to the Georgetown incident have become increasingly common across large swathes of the globe, with several similar cases appearing in the Karakum Union, New Alfr Republic, UASR, India, and Siberica among many other countries. Likely only direct portions of Japan have thus far not seen cases of this ""cyberpsychosis"" largely due to the lack of internal-body modification. However, a rapid rise in cases across the Danubian Tributary attributed to various Alfr augmentation programs. Immune to this form of cyberpsychosis however thus far, seems to be artificially created humans such as the fully artificial Alfr and allegedly the ""o-Inari"" in Japan. Researchers suggest that this is due to the lack of natural humanity - translating to an absence in clash between the sub-consciousness and artificial augmentation.

The Leech God stood above them all except Raven, neither Clover nor Jessica dared raise their head out of fear of the consequences.

""Vilane, the cringe lord."" Raven spoke with few words, instead opting to use some weird form of handjutsu-sign language to deliver his message which was then translated by the Leech God. ""The Edgelord Slayer."" 

""Even the Vampire Lord, Aima."" Raven stepped down from his ivory throne, made from the bones of those who opposed him. ""All failures, all under the thumb or surrounded by the Red Sun."" 

Clover and Jessica both nodded in agreement with Raven.

""You two don't understand...just how lonely it is...being me."" Raven's hand movements slowed, portraying sadness. ""There are no good Lords anymore...just false Gods and pretenders.""

He asked me with who and I told him with my friends (who like him) and I was planning to go alone and I told him so because I haven‚Äôt grabbed a coffee with them for a long time and the last time we did, he was there with us and yea it was nice and we had a good time but I just wanted some alone time with my friends.

Then the argument started because he doesn‚Äôt understand why he can‚Äôt come, because he feels like he doesn‚Äôt need alone time with his friends and that I‚Äôm always invited to hangout with his friends. But that‚Äôs not really the truth because yes, at first he was always inviting me but the last year or so he just goes out for a coffee with his friends and when I told him that today, he said he doesn‚Äôt ask me anymore because I always said no since they‚Äôre all guys.

And honestly, I‚Äôm fine with that because most of the time we‚Äôre together and I don‚Äôt mind him going alone with his friends so I can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs the problem?? Also, not sure if it‚Äôs relevant but my friends are F and M and they‚Äôre in a relationship but I first hung out with my friend (M) before they started dating.

Edit: he keeps saying that he doesn‚Äôt understand why my friends who are in a relationship can go out together but not us‚Ä¶ how do i explain it‚Äôs not the same? also he‚Äôs said that he also loves hanging out with them and that‚Äôs fair but why can‚Äôt we have times when all of us hang out and when it‚Äôs just me??",3,1743528771.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

**I've been getting some lovely messages from international ace's.  As I'm looking for something IRL please kindly only reply/DM if you're in the UK thank you.**

I seem to be one of the older folks around here, but thought I'd give this a try.  As the title says I'm 41 from the UK and would love to find a partner to enjoy life with.  In terms of my aceishness (not a word, but I'm running with it), I'm sex indifferent, but also consider myself kink positive, but I think that's a more private conversation for down the line.  On the flip side I can consider myself to be extremely romantic and love a good cuddle.

I work in tech (like every other Redditor it seems) and that keeps me very busy, but I find myself really lonely in my spare time, hence this post.  In terms of hobbies and interests I'm a huge lover of cinema, bit of a foodie, big reader (big interest in psychology) and I love my sci-fi, oh and coffee is my main vice.  I like to get out in nature especially if there's a cosy pub at the end of the hike.

What else?  I love animals especially dogs but don't have one at the moment unfortunately, I've dealt with my fair share of challenges in my life, but like to think that I've generally remained a positive person i.e. I've become a better more considered person despite said challenges.  

Feel free to say hello, while ultimately I'm looking for a partner I don't consider new friends a consolation prize.

1jp1guo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hardtailgang/comments/1jp1guo/heavy_hardcore_hardtail_update_the_frame_first_or/,Heavy hardcore hardtail: update the frame first or the wheels?,"I posted earlier about my hardtail which weighs about 18kg.

 I think this exess weight is probably coming from frame mostly (looks like a re-labeled Merino made with a heavy thick walled steel, it's a beautiful looking bike), then the wheels** (which are actually pretty horrible), then the fork (DVO onyx 29, which is about 500g/1lb heavier than say, a Pike, which really isn't that bad). 

I'm not going to change the dvo fork because I really love that fork. 
But getting carbon wheels or a lighter frame are upgrades I have enough spare change to do immediately. 

Second-hand I can find some really good deals on titanium and alloy hardtails (e.g. Banshee Paradox for ¬£500).
Similarly a friend selling his unused carbon enduro wheels for about 500. 

Ultimately I will change both the frame and the wheels. But my girlfriend will be pretty pissed off about my budgeting if I do both at the same time. 

So whatever upgrade I make will be would I ride for most of summer. 


What would you change first? 
A lighter high quality frame? 
Or some premium enduro carbon wheels? 

** I just weighed the rear wheel with cassette rotor tires and inner tube (normally tubeless): between the bathroom scales and the luggage scales, all set up looks like it weighs around 4 kg/8.8lb (my girlfriends coffee scales throw an error if you go over 3 kg, and they definitely throw an error!)",1,1743528650.0,Hardtailgang,3,1.0,False

Hi everyone.

Last night, my boyfriend and I ended things... on good terms. We have been together over two and a half years, and we have been best friends since we met. We were the kind of couple people compared to Corey and Topanga. Always happy. This was true behind the scenes, too. But like every couple, we had some problems.

I grew up way differently than him, so certain things are a big deal to me and not him vice versa. The biggest reason he ended things was because I made him feel like he wasn't enough. He has been feeling this way for a couple months but couldn't get it out.
He even said it has made him not want to marry me anymore (at this very moment, in the state that I am currently in). He is nothing but kind to me. Opens the door for me, treats me with care, looks out for me. Everything you want in a man. Even with everything he does, I would pick out the little things he didn't do, like get me ""just because"" flowers or offer to drive when I didn't feel good. I didn't realize how bad these things hurt him until last night. He also brought up how upset I get when he makes friends that are girls or anything of that nature. He had this one friend who I knew was bad news, and he blocked her when I told him she made me uncomfortable. For a while, I was really scared he was hanging out with her when I wasn't around, and he was upset that the thought even crossed my mind. I also get upset that he has a past with other girls. He is my first everything, and I am his first of most things, but it upsets me that I am not his first everything. These last two things have been improving, but not enough for him.

Long story short, we ended by saying we are staying
""friends"" with hopes that we end up together in the future. We work together, have classes together, and over the summer, I am going to live with him for a few weeks because of a job, so no contact is not an option. It's also not something either of us want. We hung out all of today like everything was normal.
Watched our favorite show, got our favorite coffee place, that stuff. It makes us feel good to be reminded that our relationship was great aside from a few of my insecurities. I signed up for therapy and I start in a couple of days. I know we are going to make it work, but I didn't know if anyone else was in a similar situation.

Like many of you here, I've spent way too much money and way too many mornings standing in coffee shop lines. Lately, I've been wanting to change my habits a bit‚Äîdrink healthier, cut down on unnecessary spending, and get some extra protein in my diet without drinking those chalky protein shakes that honestly taste like sadness. After browsing tons of online reviews, I finally stumbled upon something intriguing: **Javy Protein Coffee**. Today, I'm sharing my honest, balanced experience with this popular product after a full month of use.

**First Impressions: Packaging & Ingredients**

When my first bag of Javy Protein Coffee arrived, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I'd read plenty of positive **Javy coffee reviews**, but I'm skeptical by nature. The package itself was straightforward, easy to store, and clearly outlined the essential details‚Äîlike the 20 grams of whey protein per two scoops, natural caffeine content, and the inclusion of prebiotics and goMCT. For me, the ingredient transparency was crucial. You can quickly check the **Javy coffee ingredients** list, and there's nothing suspicious hiding there, which was a solid start.

**Taste & Texture: Is It Actually Good Coffee?**

I'm a coffee enthusiast‚Äîlike, I'm picky about beans, grinds, roasts, the whole deal. So, this was probably the most important part for me. I initially worried **Javy coffee protein** would taste artificial or overly sweet like other protein supplements. I chose the mocha flavor, and surprisingly, it genuinely tasted like coffee‚Äîsmooth, balanced, rich, without the dreaded aftertaste of typical protein shakes.

On my first try, I used almond milk, two scoops of Javy, ice, and a tiny splash of creamer. It blended easily in my shaker bottle, no lumps or gritty residue. I'd even argue it's comparable to a standard iced mocha you'd pay $5 or more for at your local caf√©. This wasn't something I expected from reading various **Javy coffee reviews** online‚ÄîI was pleasantly surprised.

**Effects on Appetite & Energy Levels**

Part of my initial interest in **Javy Protein Coffee** was its promise of curbing sugar cravings and helping maintain steady energy without the mid-morning crash. Usually, by around 10 am, my stomach is growling, and I'm feeling sluggish or anxious from caffeine jitters.

After consistently drinking it each morning, I noticed a gradual, yet undeniable shift. The combination of caffeine and protein indeed seemed to stabilize my energy. I wasn't reaching for mid-morning snacks, nor was I experiencing intense sugar cravings. I didn't lose significant weight magically overnight or anything dramatic, but my eating habits definitely improved. As someone who struggled with energy crashes, it felt nice to finally have something balanced.

**Gut Health and Digestion: A Nice Bonus**

Something else notable was the prebiotics (Sukr√©¬Æ) included in the ingredients. I'm not typically one to prioritize gut health, but after a few weeks, I did notice less bloating and generally better digestion. This could have been partly due to replacing my usual sugary latte habit with something cleaner and protein-based, but the added prebiotic ingredients likely played a role as well.

**Value for Money: Worth the Switch?**

One major claim I kept seeing in **Javy protein coffee reviews** was the money-saving aspect. Considering that I usually spent at least $5 a day at caf√©s, switching to this protein coffee saved me real money over the month. At roughly $25 to $30 a bag (depending on how many you buy at once), each serving costs around $1.25 to $1.50‚Äîdefinitely cheaper than daily caf√© trips. That adds up fast and is honestly one of the main reasons I'll likely stick with it.

**Any Drawbacks?**

This wouldn't be a balanced review without some critique. While I personally found the flavor pleasant, some might miss the intensity and complexity of freshly brewed artisan coffee. It tastes good, yes, but it is instant coffee mixed with whey protein‚Äîit's not going to perfectly match a premium, freshly brewed cup.

Also, I wasn't thrilled about the lactose content. It contains around 1g lactose per serving, so it's not ideal if you're severely lactose intolerant. This wasn't a huge deal for me personally, but something to keep in mind.

**Final Verdict: Should You Try Javy Protein Coffee?**

Overall, after drinking it daily for a full month, I genuinely see why Javy has garnered such enthusiastic reviews. It tastes great, blends smoothly, saves money, and provides an easy, enjoyable way to get extra protein daily. While it's not a miracle solution, it‚Äôs a practical replacement for sugary, calorie-laden coffee beverages or bland protein shakes.

Together, we can stop this but we MUST be united. We all have a role to play in this and together, all of our efforts build into something massive. Even the tiniest effort makes a difference when it's all of us.


1. Everyone needs to be getting on Lemmy and Bluesky TODAY. 50501 has a mirrored instance of this subreddit on Lemmy. Don't be discouraged by the lack of people there, we need to build it up. I suggest using new usernames there. If you're not on Signal, get on there too.


2. Anytime a political leader takes a stand, CALL THEM and show support. They need to know the people have their back. It's easy for this admin to gaslight us and our leaders so we need to validate each other.


3. Build local communities. Make connections at town halls, rallies and protests. Add people on Signal. Go to coffee house meetings. Academic professors have been speaking to people in various coffee houses in NY, let's get this movement across the country. Support academic speakers by coming out to listen to them speak, bring a donation.


4. Share evidence of our marches so other Americans see them. Our national marches are dependent on media attention. Since the media has been compromised, it's up to us to be our own press. Additionally, share evidence of good news and progress because this encourages us to unite and keep going.


5. They are trying to make us afraid but there are more of us than them. 99% is more than 1%. They are trying to ""flood the zone"", which is an authoritarian tactic used to make us feel overwhelmed with all the constant bullshit and like we can't do anything to stop this. It's easy to be afraid now. But if people don't stop this now and they gain total control, it becomes infinitely harder to stop and we will all be in a position where we wish we had acted. Don't let it get to that point.


6. Lawyers have been saying over and over again they are working diligently but they need the people in the streets keeping up the pressure. They've been calling for sustained protests. This is a fight for our democracy. 4 hours on a Saturday isn't going to cut it. This means we need either a protest where 3.5% of the population is camping out with a large amount of the population financially supporting them or protests where people are out there in shifts, ideally 3.5% of the population.


I'm not a particularly patriotic person but this stupid shit has drawn it out of me and I know other people feel that way too. Fighting for freedom is an American ideology; it's in our history, our media and our people. It's not just going to go away.",16,1743528010.0,50501,1,1.0,False

No medications other than Zyrtec to help with the hives. Changed laundry detergent to sensitive with no perfumes or dyes. Occasionally takes Tylenol/ibuprofen for cold symptoms (we have a toddler so colds are common) 
A little back story, we moved into a farm house in September 2024, never had hives before and there are no other symptoms associated with the hives. The week we moved into the house he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was put on an antibiotic. That's when we first noticed the hives so the provider switched antibiotics and the hives have seemingly never went away since. The Zyrtec he takes daily clears them up typically but if he doesn't take one the hives show up on his back, sides, and most noticeably his legs, ankles and feet. Today the Zyrtec hasn't touched the hives and they are still there. We set up an appointment for an skin allergy test but it's not for another month. We have 3 cats, is it possible he could have developed a new allergy to the cats that only causes hives with no other symptoms? Why would he never have hives until we moved here? What other questions/things should we be looking for? He drinks a lot of caffeine, a pot or 2 of coffee every day and energy drinks, could that have something to do with it?

The last time that I was put on bar a few months ago they took me off. I took that personal because I did want to be there but they took me off because I was being too slow and I went to cold bar instead. Ive taken it personally when they've removed me from hot bar to be somewhere else because I tried each time. Its fine wherever they put me.

I was surprised that I was put on hot bar today. There was a scenario where someone ordered a coffee with steamed cream and support made the coffee and then gave it to me to put the steamed cream. I put it in a separate cup instead, misreading sugar on the side for cream on the side. The team was pissed about this and being at 52 seconds at the start.  My coworker and the support refused to make the next coffee coming. This coworker would stand to the side of me just staring me down. That made me feel uncomfortable. We would later bring it down to 45 seconds when I left for my ten a little bit later but my shift was still upset.

I get back and Im on drive. Someone had been waiting on a mobile order for 3.5 minutes at the window when my coworker had just started it. Now Im watching them struggle. Then there was a separate issue with someone else and the shift had to be called and it was this big whole thing.

My skincare and diet has not changed. My skincare is using cetaphil extra gentle daily scrub every night, followed by an unscented antibacterial soap (usually dial). When I get out the shower I used Olay retinol 24 +peptide every other night, alternating with la roche posay cicaplast balm b5. I was using toner pads (knours) but stopped a couple weeks in cause it made my skin feel sticky and unclean. I keep my bedding clean and drink roughly equal amounts of coffee and water, not really any other liquids. The coffee sometimes has dairy and sometimes it's oatmilk. I hardly eat out, I'm usually cooking at home and it's seldom unhealthy foods (everything in moderation). I take a womens multivitamin (vitafusion) and fish oil daily as well. At first, I thought maybe my birth control was the issue since I was taking a progesterone only. I switched to a combination pill and this skin issue still persistents so I've concluded that it's not the birth control. I don't take any other meds. It rarely itches (I assume it's the pustules that cause this feeling), my skin isn't any more oily or dry than usual, and it doesn't feel warm/hot. It has gotten worse than this though and felt inflammed. If anyone has any suggestions or could help me out, I'd be very grateful as I can not afford a dermatologist.

Spotted some interesting news regarding US stocks. First off, $RDDT (Reddit) shares are up 2.8%. Marketbeat is asking if it's time to buy. Definitely worth a look if you're interested in the social media space.

Also, Franklin Resources Inc. increased their holdings in $SBUX (Starbucks) by 4.9%. They acquired an additional 210,011 shares. Could be a sign of confidence in the coffee giant.

On the flip side, Headlands Technologies LLC reduced their stake in $JNJ (Johnson & Johnson) by 60.3%. Something to consider if you're holding $JNJ.

Finally, keep an eye on $SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductors Bear 3x Shares). It was trading up 6.2% yesterday.

I used to believe that I struggled with weight most of my life, but looking back at old photos recently it's become pretty clear that just isn't true!

Now though, and for the past years, I've been over 17 stone at 5""2"" and it's not going anywhere. I have gone up as far as 18 stone and got down to 16 stone 7lbs since 2018. Last time I lost significant weight, was during a single phase in 2016 and I got way down to 15 stone.

Thankfully, my bloods are all fine in terms of cholesterol and diabetes, but I do struggle with my gallbladder and joint aches/pains. All exacerbated by the weight ofc.

I have constantly low iron so fatigue is really extreme a lot of the time and the doctor doesn't seem able to make my iron levels stay up since 2020. 

So I find moving hard. Especially with the joint pain and extra weight to carry. 

I desperately do not want to be this heavy. It's really affecting my mental health. 

I am not eligible for injections due to my gallbladder so I'm stuck with calorie counting and figuring out a proper deficit. 

According to what I've calculated, my BMR  is 1769, but I swear I don't eat this most days. Unless I shift my entire focus to calorie counting, and be meticulous, I either never lose or I gain weight. 

I thought it was a myth all this ""starvation mode"" stuff?

Has anyone got the latest definitive advice?

My doc told me this week that the UK Eat Well Guide is basically nonsense and I need to avoid carbs at all costs and eat lots of protein and fibre.

A typical day of eating for me might consist of:

Breakfast- black coffee

Lunch - 2 pieces of fruit (banana/orange/apple) with either a rice noodle cup, or a white bread cheese sandwich. 99 calorie bag of crisps. 

Dinner - Varies hugely but I try to be careful with portion sizing and I'm limited due to budget anyway.

A Meat based meal could be 70g dry weight pasta with homemade tomato sauce and 5% fat minced beef. Also veggies like half a courgette, 1 carrot, half a bell pepper, ans half an onion, and handful of spinach in the sauce (not blended)  and 30g Cheddar cheese.

A Plant based meal would be a three Bean chilli (butterbeans, turtle beans, red kidney beans) with all the above veg and sauce, served with 50g dry weight rice and a tortilla wraps and 30g Cheddar cheese.

Evening snack - I usually have two slices of peanut butter on toast. 

I definitely have issues with indulging when eating snacks if I'm feeling really really fatigued or I'm premenstrual. This could mean a share bag size of crisps, and maybe a large chocolate bar. Or a slice of cake and some cheese and crackers. This might happen twice a month. Not more than that.

I rarely eat takeaways. Once every 2 months at max. I don't drink sugary drinks. 

Am I just being too inconsistent? I really want to sort myself out so I'll take constructive answers but I'm really sensitive to unkindness so please be kind!",7,1743527017.0,WeightLossAdvice,8,0.73,False

Is this something I can get over??,"My 29m husband cheated on me. Well i felt like he cheated. On VALENTINES DAY his job was selling flowers. He bought some, confessed his feelings for his coworker, and gave them to her. She rejected him and told him he has a wife at home. He felt guilty and confessed to me 2 days after. I was hurt, grabbed my things, and stayed with my parents for a few weeks until we started talking again and I told myself I would give him the opportunity to fix the mess that came about. I asked why he would do it and what was wrong with me. He said nothing was wrong with me. I gave him everything he could‚Äôve wanted. He was just not happy with himself. He said he had been hiding his true self because he thought I would push away and leave him.( we have been together for 6 years) I noticed a shift in his personality when one of his friends moved in with us for two months (he got kicked out for not wanting to work /pay rent). 

His friend was always so negative and felt like there was only one way to live life so when my husband was doing things he wanted to be friend would tell him it was wrong or say something like ‚Äúa man doesn‚Äôt do that‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is why you‚Äôre never going anywhere in your life‚Äù so I understand where the confusion came from. 

He has always been good to me before the cheating. He motivated me to finish my schooling. He would do things around the house and tell me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about doing laundry because you‚Äôre stressed out. I want to help you‚Äù. When I was sad, he would buy me coffee. When we would argue he‚Äôd be like let‚Äôs just hug it out. I don‚Äôt wanna argue with you. 

Since we decided to work on things together, it has been better. We do things differently and he is more open. When I need reassurance, he‚Äôs always telling me that he‚Äôs sorry and he feels guilty and he should‚Äôve never done it and he wishes he could go back in time. That he doesn‚Äôt want to see me in pain. That even when I say that I‚Äôm OK he knows that I‚Äôm not and he tries his best to make it better. 

but I‚Äôm still stuck on it. I‚Äôm still hurt. That someone who promised me it would never happen let it happen. That‚Äôs the one time I let my guard down it happened. That he defended her when I would bring it up. That I think if she did not reject him, would he have physically cheated. I‚Äôm stuck on these what if.

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn‚Äôt appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I‚Äôm liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn‚Äôt want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.¬†

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens.¬†

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character.¬†Non stop.

I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?",4,1743526887.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1jp0pny,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jp0pny/i_28f_still_cannot_forget_and_move_on_about_my/,I (28F) still cannot forget and move on about my highschool crush despite being in a loving relationship with my true highschool sweetheart now fianc√© (28M),"Firstly, I love my fianc√© I truly believe he's the love of my life and my partner for life. We've been together since June 2014 (since I was 17) and we've had our ups and downs through long distance relationship and all.

Our wedding is in 4 months and we own a house and have been cat parents for about 2 years now. Let's call my fianc√© Adam.

I don't know if it's fear of commitment/ wedding stress / general OCD but I keep thinking about my past crushes. One in particular I can never get out of my head. Let's name him Bob for reference.

Adam and Bob do not know each other, and I've rarely spoken to my fianc√© about my experience with Bob in much detail because it was a hurtful experience. But maybe I should? Is it my guilty conciense?

I met Bob in September 2012 when I was 16 (going on 17). He was smart, friendly and kinda cute. We mainly texted a lot, lots of deep conversations about life and about each other. Mainly future thinking and career focused things. He was a smart guy, he wanted to do well in life (career in law) and aspired to attend Oxbridge universities. Our conversations would feel real and connected through text, but in reality he didn't really treat me like a friend. At one point it even felt like he was love bombing me through text, saying all the nice things a 16YO wants to hear. Yet in reality he didn't say any of those kind words or thoughts or feelings, he never asked me out on a date, not even a coffee or a lunch break. Every real life conversation felt like a competition, what grades did each other achieve etc etc.
Fast forward - he didn't get into the universities he wanted to get into. It truly knocked his confidence down. 
I recognised the red flags of, he really wasn't ready to pursue a relationship with me so I stopped returning his texts and didn't really speak to him much from around May 2013.

Let's say I had a break from 'boys' from May 2013- April 2014 because I wasn't looking for it. I wanted to focus on my exams and do well to attend the university of my choice.

Until I met Adam, my now fianc√© in May 2014. He is everything I want in my future husband, he's patient, loving, caring, and he understands me so well.

Now I dropped off the communication and texts with Bob from April 2014. But there has since been instances (2018, 2019 and 2022) where he's reached out or I've reached out to him out of each others curiosities - again this has not gone any further than a text catch up. Maybe it's me being nosey but I like knowing what people are up to these days.

In 2022 when I reached out (Age 26)- he didn't seem like he was in a good headspace mentally or career wise. He mentioned he had a breakdown which almost ended his lawyer career etc so he was spending some time back home living with his parents revaluating life/career in general. It didn't sit right with me and it just felt a bit off so I stopped texting him.

Flash forward to 2025 I head back to my hometown to visit my parents and in town out of the corner of my eye I see Bob- with his family on a walk. I genuinely don't know why I still care about Bob. He treated me like crap and played mind games with me through text. Yet I can't seem to get over the fact that he's still home (Age 29 turning 30 this year), with his parents potentially because his career has gone to shit? 

Any advice as to how I can get over my first shitty crush?
Or whether I should open up to Adam to tell him how I feel?

My skincare and diet has not changed. My skincare is using cetaphil extra gentle daily scrub every night, followed by an unscented antibacterial soap (usually dial). When I get out the shower I used Olay retinol 24 +peptide every other night, alternating with la roche posay cicaplast balm b5. I was using toner pads (knours) but stopped a couple weeks in cause it made my skin feel sticky and unclean. I keep my bedding clean and drink roughly equal amounts of coffee and water, not really any other liquids. The coffee sometimes has dairy and sometimes it's oatmilk. I hardly eat out, I'm usually cooking at home and it's seldom unhealthy foods (everything in moderation). I take a womens multivitamin (vitafusion) and fish oil daily as well. At first, I thought maybe my birth control was the issue since I was taking a progesterone only. I switched to a combination pill and this skin issue still persistents so I've concluded that it's not the birth control. I don't take any other meds. If anyone has any suggestions or could help me out, I'd be very grateful as I can not afford a dermatologist. Any suggestions are welcome and I'll answer any questions you have.

Is it possible to get past what happened?,"My 29m husband cheated on me. Well i felt like he cheated. On VALENTINES DAY his job was selling flowers. He bought some, confessed his feelings for his coworker, and gave them to her. She rejected him and told him he has a wife at home. He felt guilty and confessed to me 2 days after. I was hurt, grabbed my things, and stayed with my parents for a few weeks until we started talking again and I told myself I would give him the opportunity to fix the mess that came about. I asked why he would do it and what was wrong with me. He said nothing was wrong with me. I gave him everything he could‚Äôve wanted. He was just not happy with himself. He said he had been hiding his true self because he thought I would push away and leave him.( we have been together for 6 years) I noticed a shift in his personality when one of his friends moved in with us for two months (he got kicked out for not wanting to work /pay rent). 

His friend was always so negative and felt like there was only one way to live life so when my husband was doing things he wanted to be friend would tell him it was wrong or say something like ‚Äúa man doesn‚Äôt do that‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is why you‚Äôre never going anywhere in your life‚Äù so I understand where the confusion came from. 

He has always been good to me before the cheating. He motivated me to finish my schooling. He would do things around the house and tell me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about doing laundry because you‚Äôre stressed out. I want to help you‚Äù. When I was sad, he would buy me coffee. When we would argue he‚Äôd be like let‚Äôs just hug it out. I don‚Äôt wanna argue with you. 

Since we decided to work on things together, it has been better. We do things differently and he is more open. When I need reassurance, he‚Äôs always telling me that he‚Äôs sorry and he feels guilty and he should‚Äôve never done it and he wishes he could go back in time. That he doesn‚Äôt want to see me in pain. That even when I say that I‚Äôm OK he knows that I‚Äôm not and he tries his best to make it better. 

but I‚Äôm still stuck on it. I‚Äôm still hurt. That someone who promised me it would never happen let it happen. That‚Äôs the one time I let my guard down it happened. That he defended her when I would bring it up. That I think if she did not reject him, would he have physically cheated. I‚Äôm stuck on these what if.

Hello mga ka-panganay.

Gusto ko lang po ishare na it‚Äôs been almost 3 months since nagpost ako dito and this community truly empowered me and strengthen my core despite losing my family. (Yes po, I did cut my financial support with them and cut my communication).

Since then, nakapag focus ako building myself and treating myself. Nakapag iced coffee na ako nang walang guilt, finally.

Nag-propose rin recently ang long time boyfriend ko and my sibling saw the Facebook post. He messaged me saying na nakakahiya daw ako at wala akong binigay kundi kahihiyan sa aming pamilya.

When I said sa first paragraph na wala na kaming communication, hindi na po ako nagparamdam sa family ko. No messages, hindi rin blocked. Pero nung nabasa ko ang message ng kapatid ko na ginapang ko ang pagaaral sa kolehiyo. That‚Äôs where I decided to restrict him sa lahat ng socmed.

Isang araw lang ang engagement dinner namin, hindi niya parin pinalagpas. Hindi parin binigay sa akin.

I made the hard decision na irestrict nalang siya at iignore ang Facebook message nya. Ayoko na ring makaramdam ng kahit anong anxiety everytime tutunog ang phone ko,thinking na may masasabi siya sa mga ganap ko sa buhay.

Mula ng nawalan kami ng communication ng family ko, wala akong tanging dasal kundi sana safe sila at may nakakain. Narealize ko na kahit masakit ang trato nila sa akin, andon parin yung care. Pero it seems like, hindi sila ganon sa akin.

Siguro gusto ko lang ng validation na tama ang decision ko na 2025 will be my selfish era na finally, sarili ko muna talaga. Babawi talaga ako kay self. ",9,1743526244.0,PanganaySupportGroup,2,1.0,False

I have been friends with a woman for over 25 years who I am currently visiting/staying with while in town for chiropractic visits (my back is in bad shape after decades of hard physical labor keeping up just fine with meat eating men haha) She is one of those ""health educated, veganism is actually the worst thing for your health, le lectins, etc"" types and has always ""expressed concern"" but like....now it's her straight up telling me I have an eating disorder for being vegan. That I'm going to die young.   Every day.  Every time I put something in my mouth, she is like ""ew those broccoli lectins are what ruined your back"" or whatever. But I can't take it anymore more, it feels really weird and borderline abusive and is honestly CAUSING ME INCREDIBLE ANXIETY to even eat, shop for food, or actually be around her at all, I am so over it.  

I've  refined my diet over the years to where, if I'm doing pretty well, I am eating mostly lower carb, OMAD/skip breakfast at least, style.  And plenty, tbh lol.  Sprouted bread, avos, hemp seeds, peanut butter, some almond butter, walnuts, spirulina, romaine, arugula, broccoli, cukes, apples/seasonal fruits and veggies, very few high lectins or high oxalic acid vegetables or fake meats, very low to no sugar, no sodas or fried stuff (usually lol, but fries is a weakness), bulletproof coconut oil coffee in the morning, a few food based supplements.  I am actually super proud of how well I eat, considering I started out at 16 as a pure carb/sugar/fries and pizza vegetarian getting blood sugar whiteouts at 16.  I don't count calories or anything, and I have been vegan so long that it's thoughtless--I'm not out here meticulously creating meal plans by amino acid profile haha.

Vegans of Reddit, what do I do?  I am an honorary auntie to her kids (11 and 14, who love me) and still friends with her ex-husband.  (Yes, actually just friends, mostly because of the kids.)

For the record, I'm 19, and he's 17, which makes him almost two years younger. We met at a college event where he approached me with a note containing a compliment and said it was just for fun. He told me his friend had recorded a video of me, which he'd like to send me, and that's how he got my Instagram handle and we started talking.

He's been subtly flirting with me all this while, asking all sorts of questions about me and my life, and we text for hours every other day. One time, I think around two weeks back, he asked me if we could meet for coffee. Here's how the conversation went:

Him: Wanna meet for coffee this week?

Me: I have exams coming up, so maybe after exams?

Him: But they're from the 23rd, right? (They were starting in 10 days)

Me: Yeah, but my parents won't let me step out.

Me: Also, just wanted to confirm, are you asking me out?

Him: Idk why?

Me: Wdym Idk?üò≠

Me: It seemed like it

Him: Yeah, I guess then üò≠

Me: Wait, did I kinda make it awkward?üò≠

Him: Yes üò≠

Me: Shit, sorry

Him: No problem, chillüò≠

Him: We can meet after your exams if you're okay?

Me: Sure

Him: We'll decide the place and day later then

(I only liked the message)

Him: Wait, did I make you awkward by asking out?

Me: No, I think I did, and I feel really weird about it

Him: No worries, chillüò≠

Him: I thought you didn't like it or somethingüò≠

Me: No... how do I explain?üò≠

Him: Lmao, why do you seem kinda harsh on yourself?

Me: You're right; let's not give much importance to something so dumb. I was literally about to write a paragraph apologizingüò≠

Him: What?üò≠

Me: Yeah, lolüò≠

Him: Okay, cool

Him: I gotta go now, bye

Me: Same

Me: Bye

(The reason I behaved like this was that I panicked when he said I made it awkward. But besides that, all I really needed was clarity; I needed him to tell me if it was a date or not.)

After this conversation, he never really brought it up again, except this one time when he was teasing me about not having time to hang out with certain people ‚Äì as in himself (notice how he addressed it as a hangout). But after exams, he hasn't talked about it at all, and I'm skeptical to bring it up.

About flirting ‚Äì I'm not very forward with my flirting; I only flirt back, and that too very subtly. But this one time, he was flirting, and I gave it back a little too forward instead of playing it safe. His response to it was, ""Feel like I low-key walked into a trap, too late now,"" which meant he didn't take it well.

1jp0gas,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jp0gas/25m4f_italyeurope_could_you_be_the_one_craving/,25[M4F] Italy/Europe - Could you be the one? craving for something meaningful and real,"In a world filled with lies and facades, I crave something authentic and real, I crave a connection where my lover can come in my arms after a day that stretches full of responsibilities, without any pretense.

Being vulnerable carries an inherent risk but with right person makes it all worth it

I think most of us are afraid in some sense to love and to be completely vulnerable yet despite the risk we long for it.

I find myself deeply longing for a sincere and profound connection. Hopefully, you are looking for the same?

The capacity to love, sometimes even in the face of pain, is one of the most beautiful aspects of being human. It's a strength, and not always a weakness.

At my core, I'm a person of love, of care, of deep unyielding affection for those I hold dear.

Through the journey of healing and self-discovery, I've realized that I have much love to share. Love that is not bitter, but kind; not resentful, but forgiving; not closed, but open and willing to grow alongside someone special.

I'm invested in my attempt to forge a connection and hope you are too, I'd try to share things about me that might give you idea of the person I am.

**Essence of Me:**

I am a mix of old-school romance and modern sensibility, holding onto the ideals of loyalty and sincerity. I think handwritten notes, surprise dates, and the belief that small gestures make a big difference. I am someone who thrives on deep connections and meaningful interactions.

I‚Äôm someone who believes in the power of midnight conversations, in the healing balm of shared laughter, and in the silent solidarity of presence.

I believe in the power of empathy and the importance of being there for those who matter, even if it's a call at 3 AM. I value integrity, kindness, and a good/weird sense of humor. I find beauty in the mundane, the kind of person who finds joy in the little things and believes in taking the time to truly understand and appreciate others.

Physical Attributes:

* Height: 5'11"" (181cm)
* Build: Slim
* Hair: Straight Deep black, kept in check
* Eyes: Brown
* Beard: Short, fashionable, and pristinely groomed
* Complexion: Tanned, Caramel toned

**Interests:**

I find solace in music that echoes my moods, books that transport me to other worlds, and quiet moments in nature that ground me. I cherish activities that nurture growth, whether they're intellectual debates, serene walks, or shared laughs over coffee. I'm drawn to the arts as much as to the simple pleasure of a sunset.. I also have a keen interest in cooking and experimenting with new recipes, finding the act of creating something delicious for others as a form of expression and care.

To sum up some typical interests include: Philosophy, nature, languages, books, reading, writing, video games, sports, art, poetry, travelling etc

**What I Am Looking For:**

I'm in search of someone who values open and honest communication as much as I do. Someone who understands that relationships are about growth, learning, and supporting each other through life's myriad challenges and joys. I am looking for someone who is eager to prioritize getting to know each other, willing to open their heart, and ready to build something meaningful together.

Expectations:

* Mutual respect and understanding
* Openness and honesty in communication
* A shared desire to prioritize our relationship and growth
* An interest in exploring life's depths and joys together

**The Quest for You:**

What am I seeking? Not a perfect person, but a real one. Someone whose heart speaks the language of kindness, whose spirit dances to the tune of sincerity. I dream of a connection where words are just the beginning, where vulnerability is not a weakness but our strongest bond. I yearn for a love that‚Äôs both a safe harbor and a grand adventure, a partnership built on mutual respect, understanding, and the shared bravery of baring one‚Äôs soul.

I seek a fellow traveler in this journey of life, one who understands that while our pasts may shape us, they do not define us. Someone who stands at the intersection of hope and reality, ready to embark on a path not devoid of challenges but rich with the promise of true companionship.

**Epilogue of Hope:**

If my words have stirred something in your heart, if you too are navigating the vast oceans of life in search of a genuine connection, then perhaps we are two stars meant to align in the constellation of fate. I extend my hand, my heart, and my story to you ‚Äì not in desperation, but with the quiet confidence of one who has faced the night and yearns for the dawn.

Laconic messages with just ""hi"", ""what's up,"" and the likes will be most likely ignored. If I can beat my own laconism when introducing myself here, so can you.",1,1743526216.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

For each creative I have 2 ad sets for each 1 ad set being broad with no custom audiences and the 2nd with coffee, espresso, hiking, camping, traveling, etc. 

Now on the first creative I ran an engagement ad first and my cost per engagement was crazy good top 1% at a cost per engagement of 0.00210

Then I went to link clicks with the same preexisting post that the first creative was and got a link clicks cost of .10 as normal it‚Äôll go up. But then when I went to add to cart sales optimization it jumped to nearly $3 for cost ad to cart. 

Now I since jumped from the single campaign ad set and creative and did what I have stated above. I have 3 creatives 6 ad sets 2 for each. My cost per click is $1 right now.

## Key Features Analysis

The screen protector market is crowded, so its importent to know what to look for. Key aspects to consider are material type, hardness rating, transparency, touch sensitivity, and ease of installation.

**Material:** A screen protector's durability hinges on its material. tempered glass offers robust protection against scratches and impacts, while PET film is thinner and more flexible, providing scratch resistance but less impact protection. Hybrid options combine the best of both worlds, offering a balance of durability and versatility.

Tempered glass screen protectors are generally the most popular due to their superior hardness, typically rated 9H on the Mohs scale. This means they can withstand scratches from keys, coins, and even knives. PET film is a more affordable option but is less resistant to damage.

**Hardness Rating:** The hardness rating indicates a screen protector's scratch resistance. A 9H rating is the industry standard for tempered glass,meaning it can resist scratches from most common objects. Lower hardness ratings, found in PET film protectors, offer less protection against scratches.

It is important to consider the type of surroundings your iPad will be used in. If it's likely to be exposed to rough conditions,a 9H tempered glass protector is highly recommended.

**Transparency and Clarity:** A good screen protector should be virtually invisible and should not distort the screen's image quality. Look for protectors with high transparency ratings (typically around 99%) to ensure optimal viewing experience.

Lower-quality protectors can have a cloudy or grainy appearance, reducing the screen's clarity and affecting color accuracy. It's crucial to choose a protector that allows the iPad's vibrant display to shine through.

**Touch Sensitivity:** A thick or poorly designed screen protector can interfere with the iPad's touch sensitivity, making it difficult to type, swipe, or use the Apple Pencil. Opt for protectors that are designed to maintain the screen's original responsiveness.Some protectors even feature a special coating that reduces friction, allowing your finger to glide smoothly across the screen. It's important to check user reviews to ensure that the protector doesn't negatively impact touch sensitivity.

**Ease of Installation:** Applying a screen protector can be tricky, and air bubbles are a common annoyance. Look for protectors that come with an installation kit, including a cleaning cloth, dust removal stickers, and an alignment frame.

Some protectors even have self-adhesive properties that make them easier to apply. It is very important to follow the instructions carefully during installation to prevent air bubbles and ensure a proper fit.

## core Benefits

Choosing the right iPad 10th generation screen protector provides numerous benefits, extending the life of your device and enhancing your user experience.

**Enhanced Screen Protection:** A screen protector acts as a barrier against everyday hazards like scratches, fingerprints, and smudges, preserving the iPad's display and preventing costly repairs. Dropping your iPad can crack the original glass, but if you have a tempered glass screen protector, it will be the thing that cracks instead of your actual iPad screen.

**Improved Resale Value:** By keeping your iPad's screen in pristine condition, a screen protector helps maintain its resale value. Potential buyers are more likely to pay a premium for a device that looks new. Scratches, chips, or deep cracks detract from its value, so it's smart to protect your investment.

**Glare Reduction and Eye Strain Relief:** Some screen protectors come with anti-glare coatings that reduce reflections from sunlight or overhead lights, making it easier to view the screen in bright environments. The reduced glare also minimizes eye strain, allowing you to use your iPad for longer periods without discomfort.

**Privacy:** Privacy screen protectors restrict the viewing angle, preventing people next to you from seeing what's on your screen.This is especially useful in public places like trains, buses, or coffee shops.

**Does the iPad 10th generation screen protector affect Apple Pencil functionality?**

**Can I reuse an iPad 10th generation screen protector after removing it?**

**How do I clean my iPad 10th generation screen protector?**
Use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe the screen protector.Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the coating. Microfiber cloths are ideal for removing fingerprints and smudges without scratching the surface.

Our acquaintance began in the elevator, progressing to a casual outing after he inquired about my plans. Dressed in baggy pants and a crop top, I suggested a walk around the mall, and he joined me.

We started at a coffee shop, where we engaged in conversation, and then decided to have tequila shots. Moving to another floor, we found a lively crowd. A man, strikingly similar in appearance to my neighbor, entered and observed us. He eventually approached and joined our table. During introductions, he invited my neighbor to meet his friends, but my neighbor declined, stating he wouldn't go without me.

Subsequently, we found ourselves in a social gathering where it became apparent that most of the men present were in same-sex relationships( 3 were foreign 4 were Kenyans). As the only woman, I felt uncomfortable. While I have no prejudice against same-sex relationships, the atmosphere was unsettling, and I felt a strong urge to leave.

* We had an AirBnB in Bucktown and it was a great spot for us. Right on a bus stop. Quick access to the Blue and Brown trains.
* We ordered grocery delivery the first day so we could eat breakfasts in the condo and one dinner. That was easy, affordable and quick!
* The 7-day CTA pass was just fantastic. Got us everywhere we wanted to go efficiently, easily and remarkably cheaply. We only Uber-d a couple of times. Only downside: the incessant smell of dope in the trains. People just can't help being selfish a-holes. It's the human condition.
* All meals were good, most were great. Prices feel high but that's modern life. Service was uniformly professional and solid. In fact: I think we've become so numb to shitty service in restaurants that Chicago was a revelation. We had great service in almost every spot.
   * Kyuramen - Is this a tourist spot? Because it sure as hell was good. Fantastic lunch.
   * Kai Zan sushi - Amazing and beautiful food.
   * Little Bad Wolf - We split a burger and a grilled romaine salad. Large portions. We almost got in a fight over sharing the burger. SOOOOOOO good.
   * Serio Pizza - The crust was a perfect balance point between Neapolitan airiness and char and New York structure and chew. Tomato sauce was bright and fresh. Grande mozzarella. It's not cheap but it's a GREAT pie. Stand out service.
   * Ed and Jean's Tavern - We only had a couple of cocktails, but they were GREAT, and the spot was a highlight of the trip. We wanted to go twice but ran out of time.
   * Pompette - We went for breakfast and the coffee was strong and the shakshuka was perfect.
   * Publican - what a great place. We had a disappointing server (she was very nice but was simply overmatched once it got busy). We had prix fixe Sunday special meal that was delicious and memorable.
   * King of Chicken - Quick lunch salads. The chicken was moist and flavorful. House made salsas were delicious!
   * Mr. Beef - We didn't realize that this was the spot that was used as inspiration for The Bear (which we love). The sandwich was GREAT but feeling like part of a tourist mob made us feel dorky. Surprisingly friendly counter help considering the pressure from the crowd. The fries were meh. But that means we ate less of them.
   * The Hat - Quick lunch. Unmemorable diner.
* We saw ""School for Scandal"" at The Edge theater. LOVED IT. Almost claustrophobic the space is so tight, but the actors were great.
* The boat tour done by the Architecture Center was expensive but well worth it. The 90 minutes FLEW by and there was so much information I wish it would have been a 2.5-hour tour. I thought I knew a LOT about buildings, history and design in Chicago. I learned I have a LOT to learn. They give you access to the Center itself with a ticket stub and $5. That was a good use of time too. The model of the city on the main floor almost made me faint. It is amazing.
* The museum of design is free and interesting.
* Millenium Park and the Cloud / ""bean"" was interesting in that there was some turd walking around telling folks he'd take their pictures (with their phones). Once he handed the phone back to them, he'd ask them for a money for the trouble. High pressure sales especially on young females. I walked behind him and told folks I'd do it for free. He got agro and called me a motherfucker. ME? Sir, I'm offended.
* Highly recommend watching ""The Untouchables"" before you go to Chicago so you can go see all the cool filming locations. It's criminal that they tore down Malone's apartment on Racine.
* We handed our transit passes back to the CTA employees at MDW since they had 2 days left on them. They said they will give them to people in a pinch.
* My wife is mad we didn't do the observation deck / tilt thing at Hancock tower. It's ridiculously expensive. I've been up in the Willis / Sears Tower. It was cool but if you've been in a plane, you've seen the view.

So, thank you, windy city for a wonderful time. It was good to see you all again. Can't wait to come back!

I've imported from Japan one of the games used for the LUA exploit: 'Raspberry Cube' (FYI, I'm on 6.02).

 Unfortunately, my copy was not the correct version: mine had code **PLJM16452**, while the savefile available via the ""restore backup"" method comes from version **CUSA16074** (I was not aware there was more than one version).
Result: it's not working.

And later I've discovered it would not have worked anyway: the LUA method only works with activated consoles, and mine is not :(

Getting back to the wrong LUA game: since this is still one of the games it can be used for the exploit, it could be possible to salvage the situation by ""converting"" the savefile to match my version of the game.
The problem is: since I haven't activated the console, I cannot use this method.
And of course, I can only activate the console offline if I've already jailbroken it :(

This whole sorrowful tale leads me to my plea: is there any kind soul who would be willing to share a disk for the BD-JB version of the exploit?
I would only need it once: after that I would be able to arrange things so that I could use my dirty dirty hentai game in its stead.

And I promise I'll re-share the disk with whoever needs it as soon as I finish with it :)

She has three daughters (25, 18, and 5), each with different fathers. Her youngest daughter‚Äôs father is Russ (47), whom she reconnected with after 20 years. They originally split when they were young because Russ went to jail for so-called ""petty crimes.""

Before Russ, Jade was with Mal (46) for 12 years. Her daughters called Mal ""dad,"" though none were biologically his. When she left Mal, she moved Russ into her house practically the next day, despite her family's disapproval.

One day, Jade and Russ visited my son in the hospital. While they were there, she mentioned that her eldest daughter didn‚Äôt like Russ and admitted she was heavily considering cutting her out of their lives. I was shocked. I couldn‚Äôt believe she was saying this - not only about her own daughter but also while visiting my sick child in the hospital. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond, so I let it go at the time. But it has always weighed on me, and my opinion of her had changed because of it. I tried to move past it, but I just can‚Äôt.

While they were together, Russ couldn‚Äôt hold a job, and Jade eventually became pregnant with their daughter. Over time, she confided in me about Russ's abusive behavior, which escalated to the point where police had to intervene - he once held their baby in one hand while threatening her with a knife in the other. Her family and I convinced her to leave, and her son-in-law even offered to pay for her to relocate.

After she left, Jade told me Russ had a history of abuse, including allegations that he sexually assaulted his own daughter from a previous relationship. I urged her to keep their daughter away from him, but she insisted on maintaining contact because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs her father.‚Äù

The breaking point for me was on New Year‚Äôs Eve 2024. Over coffee, Jade casually admitted she was still seeing Russ‚Äîjust for sex. She repeatedly bragged, loudly, about how much she enjoyed it. When I asked her to lower her voice, she laughed and said, even louder, ‚Äúthese people have probably never had an orgasm like mine.‚Äù I was appalled and left immediately. What made it even worse was that not long before this, she had acknowledged what Russ had done to his own daughter. I felt physically sick. In that moment, I knew I couldn‚Äôt be her friend anymore.

I'm not sure if trauma or mental illness plays a role in this, as she has claimed to have several conditions‚Äîall of which are self-diagnosed. Either way, it seems to be a mix of both, given that she not only self-diagnoses but also labels those around her, including her daughters, son-in-law, grand children, brothers, parents, and even me. I find this behaviour quite odd.

But now, three months later, I feel conflicted. AITA for cutting her off, or should I try to be there for her?

I am a very straight forward person. Improving at things and doing things efficiently is something I really enjoy doing. I am a very open person once I know someone for a bit. I have a somewhat dry/sarcastic/witty sense of humor and can enjoy dark humor. For those interested, I am an INTJ.

I am very much a nerd (as shown by my major). My hobbies include building, painting, and playing Warhammer 40k. I also enjoy gaming (mainly PC). My favorite game series is monster hunter. Recently I have been playing marvel rivals, Minecraft and monster hunter wilds.

I also enjoy reading and music.

1jp03n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jp03n8/i_21f_am_dating_my_coworker25m/,I [21F] am dating my co-worker[25M],"
I will start this by saying yes, people say never eat where you shit. AKA, never date a coworker. Now, when i (21F) started working at this company i was completely avoiding dating, i hadn't really ever dated much anyway, but knowing the nature of guys around our age in big organizations, i was careful. Hell, i wasn't interested in anything because i knew everyone was basically just looking for a good time, etc etc.

Sooo‚Ä¶ things happened, i was introduced to a colleague (25M) via another colleague (23F). It started off as just a casual long conversation on a day where the office was pretty much empty (we work Saturday's and everyone basically skipped that day because it was the 1st of the month) and after a while, when she and I were alone together she told me he had a thing for me.

I was like... okay, but at that point everyone i was friends with (2 other female colleagues) already knew the drill, if anyone asks, i'm not single. (I wanted to avoid unnecessary drama), but i got talking to him and i felt like we got along pretty well, so he asked me out on a casual date. We just got drinks at a cafe and talked for about 2 hours, exchanged a few stories and laughs. I was confused about whether or no i liked him, and it was way too soon to tell because we'd only ever see each other at work. We started hanging out more during work breaks and sometimes even after work (again, sticking to casual coffee dates) when he told me he'd liked me for a while, like far longer than i'd noticed him.

So i slowly realized that maybe i should just stop being such a clam, and let myself experience something fun for once (i struggle with anxiety and ADHD) and it was going.. kind of well for a while, but i feel like it all happened too quick? Like we were in the talking stage, but i'd basically see him 6 days a week, and he'd call me on our way home from work everyday and.. well, it didn't exactly feel all that nice to me, but i thought i was running away from something normal because i'd only ever experienced avoidance and neglect with other guys i'd briefly dated.

I mostly subconsciously suppress my emotions, so i tend to feel really dead and numb inside and it makes gauging how i actually feel pretty hard. This went on for over a month, and by then everyone who worked with us had basically found out and started joking about things like marriage and teasing us. Now i don't usually care about stuff like that, but i realized that maybe i was convincing myself everything was okay and normal when it wasn't.

He's admitted to having an ego, and he's sought out validation multiple times, most times not even giving me the opportunity to agree that an outfit looks good, or if something (like sunglasses) suit him, he just immediately goes ""oh they don't, right? Like i'm ugly?"" And i just... what?? I know an insecure person when i see one, so i've just reassured him that he looks good, but then it started to feel forced because i felt like i was prompted to assure him of things? He also says things like ‚Äúwhat i could do for you, no other man has‚Äù and ‚Äúi know for sure that you WILL regret it one day and miss me‚Äù (again, huh??) 

All i can say is, ignoring the small things is a bad idea. I'm not sure if i'm just extra critical, or if there's some sort of issue here that could pose as a red flag in the future. Fast forward to recently, we had a long weekend come up, and he planned to take me out, to the beach and then on a staycation?? We aren't officially dating, we've only been getting to know each other for little over a month or so, and he tried to get me to go on a staycation saying that it‚Äôd be fun. I thought it would be, but i was still hesitant.

One thing about me is, if i don't want to do something, my body will physically reject it to the point where i HAVE to say something and remove myself from the situation. So i texted him and told him i just wasn't up for a staycation and he was like ""okay, let's at least go out then, and see where the night takes us, if you want we can stay somewhere, or you can go home.‚Äù 

At this point my whole mood was utterly mucked up and i didn't want to go anywhere at all, and then our female colleague (23F) who claims to be his ‚Äòbestie', texted me saying ""oh you and ___ are committed, right? So what's the issue? You can just go out, and talk""

When i told him initially, that i didn't want to go.
He was like ""why?"", ""why are you spoiling my holiday ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤‚Äù (umm???)

I didn't WANT to go, i wasn't up for it. I told her exactly that, and she was like ""i called him, he's in a bad mood now"" and i just.. why should i be responsible for the way someone else reacts to something? His mood should never depend on me, he's literally his own person. I told her his mood should not depend on mine and all she said was ""but it is, you know it is, right?""

I'd been feeling this slow building pressure to
BE something, and it wasn't until i stopped and thought about it that i realized he was kind of love bombing me? He kept talking about how i was his priority now, how he had to focus on me and protect the ones he cared about. And okay that's sweet, WHEN you've known someone for a long while, at least a good 6 months right??

He'd also dropped the L-word a few times, not directed at me, but i was in the context. Like ""i take care of the people i love"" etc.

After i‚Äôd dropped him the texts with my concerns about what was going on between us, he kind of brushed it off by saying ""you have your whole life"", ""you aren't going to marry me, right?"" And ""why are you thinking so much about it.""

When i've expressed how stressed i am about certain problems i'd dealt with, he's always assumed the problems were either with him or work. Like no, people have bigger, deeper issues in their lives. We struggle with things like mental health, and he just didn't seem to grasp onto that. I tried to tell him about my anxiety and he gave me a list of the most trivial reasons that all seemed to revolve around a relationship with him or my family.

Anyways, our mutual tried to convince me to go and i got irritated because she was like ""oh i saw that you were out yesterday.. nice"" insinuating that i could spend time with my family, but i'm suddenly too tired to go on a date? How is that anyone's business?

My mood HAS been down these past few days, and i haven't had the energy to do much outside of 1 family gathering over the weekend and 1 short roadtrip and dinner with my brother and mother the day after that.

What the hell do i do about this guy? genuinely need some advice because i don't know if i'm the crazy villain here or if my feelings are valid. 

My question here is, should i try to communicate this to him properly again, or am i better off just ending things and focusing on work and my social life? 

 **tl;dr**: I started seeing my co-worker and started noticing little things that could potentially be red flags, and i‚Äôm confused, am i thinking too much about the situation?

April 1, 2025

Woke up at 6AM. No alarm. No earthquake. No divine voice. Just me. Awake. At six. In the morning. I lay in bed for five minutes staring at the ceiling, wondering if this was how monks lived (minus the robes) (plus Wi-Fi) (and a dog with opinions). Then Missy (our 10-year-old Pomeranian who has more attitude than a pop star‚Äôs entourage) gave me the look, the one that says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm either pooping on your floor or outside. Your call.‚Äù

So we walked. Missy pooped. Twice. (Once with dignity, once with flair.) Paris was still asleep. The Eiffel Tower yawned. The¬†*boulangers*¬†hadn‚Äôt even begun flirting with croissants yet. It was peaceful. Too peaceful. Like the prelude in a movie before the aliens land.

Back home, Mina was already up, looking like a goddess armed with a coffee mug (which said ‚ÄúMama Needs a Nap‚Äù). We commenced the sacred morning ritual of Getting Summer Ready for School. A task only slightly less complex than launching a space shuttle.

Now, Summer had a headache yesterday (we think from her brain juggling too much French ‚Äî she said she dreamt in French and forgot the word for ‚Äútoothbrush‚Äù in English. A crisis, obviously). Possibly also from an episode of I Woke Up a Vampire about identity, friendship, and maybe fangs. So today, we tried something gentle but effective: no screen time in the morning.

And voil√†! Ready in 30 minutes. No yelling. No tears. Just a very focused 8-year-old brushing her hair and mumbling something about how Tuesdays have bad energy and should be optional. Which, honestly, felt fair.

Work-from-home day for Mina and me, like every day, really. We run our little software business from the hallway and the dining table (headquarters: Paris and Manila, branch office: wherever the coffee is strongest). She‚Äôs a focused queen, gracefully gliding through tasks. I‚Äôm more of a chaotic raccoon with a laptop, typing, clicking, occasionally muttering ‚Äúwhy is this happening‚Äù at my screen. There‚Äôs coffee. There‚Äôs passive-aggressive typing. There‚Äôs dramatic sighing (90% me, 10% the Wi-Fi).

Lunch was¬†*Tapsilog*, but French. Basically‚Ä¶ steak, rice, and eggs. I called it ‚Äú*Tapsil≈ìuf*.‚Äù No one laughed. Not even Missy (she usually chuckles at my food puns in her own silent, judgmental way).

Summer had Art class today. In English. Supposedly. She came home a bit puzzled.

‚ÄúDaddy,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthe teacher‚Äôs English is kinda funny. I think I speak it better.‚Äù

I smiled and shrugged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when your first words were in Netflix.‚Äù

Dinner was raclette and ham in baguette, also known as melted cheese magic with cured pig dreams (I assume dreams are extra melty). Summer loves it because she gets to stab things with little forks. Mina loves it because cheese. I love it because it makes me feel like a Viking who‚Äôs also lactose-tolerant.

Post-dinner, post-bath, and post-Summer vetoing my bedtime story (‚ÄúNice try, but where‚Äôs the twist?‚Äù (There was none)), it was finally time.

I poured myself a glass of beer. Mina joined me with her tea, some fancy herbal blend with a name longer than our street (and probably blessed by a forest elf). We clinked glasses (and paws ‚Äî Missy insisted, as always, on being part of the ritual). And then we drank.

Mine tasted‚Ä¶ bittersweet. Like a Tuesday that tried its best. Like growing up in slow motion. Like watching your daughter become cleverer than you and being proud (and slightly terrified).

But all in all, it was a good day.

My grinder is the Fellow Ode Gen 2, and I always use the same single-serve recipe: 16g of coffee to 256g of water (1:16 ratio).

I‚Äôve seen the general advice that if coffee tastes too sour, grind finer; if it‚Äôs too bitter, grind coarser. I currently grind at a size 9 on the Ode Gen 2, which is the setting Ratio themselves recommend for the Four. With this setting, the coffee starts off tasting pretty balanced, but halfway through the cup it becomes noticeably more sour. I‚Äôm not sure if that means I should stir the coffee before drinking or if something else is going on.

For reference, I once tried Subtext‚Äôs recommended grind size for V60 (5 and 2/3 ticks on the Ode Gen 2), thinking it might suit the Ratio Four since it mimics pour-over. But the result was so bitter I couldn‚Äôt even finish the cup.

Is anyone else using the Fellow Ode Gen 2 with the Ratio Four and Subtext beans? I‚Äôm almost out of beans and would prefer not to waste them testing multiple grind sizes. If you‚Äôve dialed in a grind that works well, I‚Äôd really appreciate the recommendation!",3,1743525168.0,pourover,4,0.8,False

Good morning,

some kind of news

After a certain narrative talent, otherwise once printed it serves as double-effect toilet paper: reading makes you want the paper to wipe you.

# The second year student

-	Hold ! Look at this photo.  
‚Äî Mm, is this a class photo?  
‚Äî End of second year.  
‚Äî Do you become nostalgic with age?  
-	There  
Tapping the photo with a gnarled index finger. I focus on the face of the girl he points to. A young brunette woman, medium height, dressed classically for the time. A mid-length haircut with a turban, nothing fancy. Why show it to me? a former crush?  I raise a questioning look at my friend. His reaction is immediate.  
‚ÄîHow old do you think he is?  
‚Äî Twenty years.  
‚Äî Twenty-two!  
-	Good. How old were you yourself this year?  
-	Twenty-one.  
‚Äî An impossible love?  
‚Äî No, I was already going out with Isabelle  
Saying this, he mechanically turns his head towards the portraits which line the living room wall. Isabelle at all ages. It is no longer a souvenir wall, it is a real temple, facing the wall this armchair where he spends long hours. My friend has aged, he who resembled a Norman wardrobe, it is with the loss of Isabelle transformed into this shadow on which his clothes float.  
‚ÄîAnd, what brings us to.  
I ask, tapping the photo.  
‚Äî What was special about her that made it stand out to you?  
‚Äî A reserved girl, rather secretive, no boyfriend  
‚Äî 1960, girls were rather cautious. They avoided jumping on the first cock that came along.  
‚Äî I see that your way of describing social relations is always imbued with the same sense of proportion tinged with poetry.  
‚Äî No pill, a risk of getting an eighteen-year hard sentence, that motivates restraint.  
‚Äî It‚Äôs not false, no! There wasn't a word I didn't understand. Three months ago, I met her in the neighborhood, she hadn't changed one bit.  
‚Äî Twenty-two years old in 1960, his granddaughter or great-granddaughter saw a simple resemblance, lookalikes happen.  
He gets up, annoyed. Pick up his doctor's bag. Curious that he brought this thing out, since his retirement I had never seen him take it out of his office. He rummages through it, pulls out a cardboard folder which must have, at a distant time, been salmon. Handing it to me  
‚Äî Here, bed.  
I make him happy, writing with a pen, the ink is faded. This is a medical report. Damn, in pen and it's not only readable but with careful writing, full and clear. It talks about a young female nurse injured in the face in 1917. The affected medical student had performed treatment and recorded this in this report.  
-	And ?  
‚Äî Look at the photo.  
Stapled to the folder is a small folded piece of cardboard. I open and take out a film photograph. Very clear and admirably preserved. Face and profile. The resemblance is stunning.  
‚Äî Where did you get that?  
‚Äî In my archives  
-	What ?  
‚Äî The student was my father, you know that in the family we have a cruel lack of imagination, we have been doctors from generation to generation. At the FAC, this girl had left an impression on me, the feeling of having seen her before.  
‚Äî You have other photos of her from the FAC.  
‚Äî That‚Äôs where there‚Äôs something fishy.  
‚Äî You can avoid expressions cut with templates    

 ‚ÄîWould you prefer a ball in the soup?  
‚Äî No, I prefer, no expression at all.  
‚Äî Okay, so this is the only photo from this period where she appears. Photos of lecture halls, parties, graduations, if she is present, her face is hidden.  
‚Äî A phobia of cameras.  
‚Äî No, she is hiding something  
‚Äî Maybe she's cross-eyed.  
‚Äî I'm serious, take the magnifying glass on my desk and examine the photos  
Well, I'll do him this pleasure. Oldest photo first. An examination of the face and the wound. The proximity of the eye was peeled by a splinter. It draws a red, blistered line. Okay end of year photo. The girl avoids looking at the camera. She really seems to be trying to hide. Fear of being recognized, many people try to disappear and avoid leaving traces of their passage. It could very well be mother and daughter.  
‚Äî No‚Ä¶  
I stop, look at the photo from different angles.  
‚Äî Yes, as I remember she had a scar near her eye. She claimed to have fallen off her bike at four years old.  
‚Äî Possible, right?  
‚Äî I found the photographer who took these photos.  
‚Äî Wait, how old is he?  
‚Äî Not him in person but the studio. His grandson took over after his father.  
‚ÄîAnd he kept everything?  
I'm kidding. My laughter fades as he nods.  
‚Äî As strange as it may seem. And even more so, everything is classified.  
I look at him with wide eyes. He resumes.  
‚Äî A case of hereditary pathological mania.  
‚Äî You surprise me, and what happened?  
He takes an envelope from his satchel, and presents me with the photo it contains. The portrait of the girl takes up the entire format. The scar is the exact trace of the wound from 1917. In front of my convinced look he takes out two others, not envelopes, but photographic sleeves. In this digital age, negatives, 24x36 and 6x6 are strange. Whoa, he took out the devices from the Nic√©phore Niepce museum.  
‚Äî I had to play the role of lover of the facades of old Lyon, and for several days I took photos.  
I'm taking out the photos. Clever my friend, while pretending to machine-gun facades, another device was pointed at an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sidewalk to which he almost turned his back, aiming at a given height. A true hunter on the prowl. In any case he succeeded in his shots. The face is perhaps not framed according to the artistic rules of the portrait painter, but they capture the subject well. In many of the photos, a layer of makeup makes the search useless, but four of them show a scar near the eye, exactly the same.  
-	What do you want ?  
‚Äî Talk to him, understand.  
‚ÄîAnd what am I supposed to do, broker?  
‚Äî In the end, bring him to me, but find out his whole story. You have all the necessary credits to investigate.  
‚Äî There are detective agencies for that.  
‚ÄúWhatever you find, I know you'll keep it to yourself. A private one, how can you be sure? and I do not want to harm him in any way whatsoever.  
‚Äî Ok, I'll get to work, but it might take a long time. I point to the photo from 1960,  

‚Äî Her name was at the FAC. ‚Äî Agn√®s Montgorget June 2024  
For four years I have been scraping through the archives of everything lying around in the cities of France. I've been playing the sleuth all this time. With each discovery, I reported to my friend who remained in Lyon. I have completed almost four-fifths of life after Agn√®s. Yes, I'm leaving Agn√®s to unwind the thread to Nolens Monterrat. Needless to say, this name is as bogus as any I've come across. Good at covering her tracks. But, shit searches always manage to find a scent that redirects them. And I also found an alias before Agn√®s and here, I'm touching on the improbable. The photo was of a nude model, a photograph from 1889. The same face, the same constitution. Naturally no scar, just a small birthmark on the left collarbone. The same one that appears in one of the photos taken in Lyon. Filling out his life between 1889 and 1917 is the challenge of the millennium.  
I stopped my search. My friend told me he was sick. I carried it a little.  
‚Äî You‚Äôre a doctor, right? It‚Äôs like cycling, you can‚Äôt forget it!  
‚ÄîIt‚Äôs precisely because I‚Äôm a doctor.  
He was never the hypochondriac type. As soon as I got down to the part-dieu I went to the young lady‚Äôs address. I took advantage of her arrival to pass the digital code in one smooth movement and enter the hall with her.  
‚Äî Josette Boulanger, Agn√®s Montgorget, Lucienne Grandjean, Roberte Perrin, Christine Bulot, Nolens Monterrat. She turned around livid. She stares at me in panic while backing away.  

 ‚Äî Watch out for the stairs. She looks at the step and grabs onto the railing.   

 ‚Äî I am aware that my introduction, faced with someone who has been in hiding since at least 1900, is undoubtedly disturbing. But I'm just giving you a message. Here is a file, there are only two copies. The second will be given to you by its holder, all he wants from you is you talk.  
She takes what I offer her with a trembling hand.  
‚Äî Where should I see him?  
‚Äî To his place, I can take you there right away or you can go there when you decide. However, don't wait too long, he may not be around for long.  
I'm heading to my car when she calls me back.  
-	Wait ! take me there.  
‚Äî Oh over there, it‚Äôs right next door. Two streets further. I would have thought you would have taken more time to think about it.  
She takes out the notebook from inside the folder. Yes, a chronological summary where I wrote everything down and put each reference document there are about ten empty pages before arriving at the 1889 photo the name of the artist for whom she posed. She flips through the empty pages, looking at me.  
‚Äî I think there is room to go back further.  
She turns the pages stopping on each empty page, placing her hand on it.  
‚Äî It was this notebook that convinced me. If‚Ä¶  
‚ÄîIf I wanted you harm, I wouldn‚Äôt have handed it over to you. Is that it?  
‚Äî Mm  
I open the door, I've had a double for years. Vincent is in his chair, a tray of medicine within his reach.  

 ‚Äî I‚Äôm bringing you your‚Ä¶ fellow student. Damn he really doesn't look good. I really did well to stop the research, plus it doesn't say that I could have scraped a lot more information. Well, I will have to warn the miss that if I found so much about her, it is because without realizing it she follows a pattern in these movements. It might help him to be less noticeable. She followed the same pattern but in Lyon. I'm in the kitchen alone with the coffee maker. Suddenly I join them. I take the notebook back and open the travel map for France, not the city.  Vincent looks at me.  

 -	What ? I point at him, looking at her with furrowed brows.  

 ‚Äî You knew who he was, you circled around him. The photographs of the facades, my ass, that didn't deceive you  
They both look at the map with my colored lines. And my finger tracing the routes.  
‚ÄîBut, but what...  
‚Äî You revolve around Vincent.  
-	Finally‚Ä¶  
‚Äî No, Agnes, if he says it, what he shows proves it. I don't understand what he sees, but he's never wrong  
‚Äî Uh, Vincent, not often. SO ?  
‚Äî I am... A moment of hesitation, I feel that there is something hard to get out of  

 ‚Äî His mother.  
Okay, which would explain why Vincent never had a photo of his mother, who according to his father had abandoned him at birth. I feel like there are going to be explanations between the two. Since this is their story, I go back to keep company at the coffee maker. I left, I left them together. Just a quick hello from the door. Curious to see an old man I've known for years with his young mother. It's true that there are things that I don't understand, but even if the puzzles excite me they don't keep me from sleeping.  
January 2025  
Vincent's funeral, a large crowd. He was known and loved, my friend. Like every time I go to a funeral I stay away. Going to church, a tradition that I do not respect. The only times I set foot in this type of building is as a visitor to historical monuments, never for the extravaganzas that take place there. A convinced atheist, I'm not going to act like a hypocrite. Same, I only go to the grave when everyone has adjourned. The pile of earth there is still smoking in the January cold. I‚Äôm sure that even if I didn‚Äôt see him often, I‚Äôll miss him. We stayed a year sometimes more, and we resumed our conversation as if we had left the day before. This time I am not alone in front of the grave. I give a little nod.  
‚ÄîNolens.  
‚ÄîI saw you staying away. You don't like his family?  
‚Äî Nothing to see. But I also saw you staying even more apart.  
‚Äî You know why.  
‚Äî For three people to keep a secret, two of them must be dead.  
She stares at me with bulging eyes.  
‚Äî Don't worry, it's just a quote from a station novel author.  
‚Äî Does the station novel still exist?  
‚Äî Hardly any more. What are you going to do?  
‚Äî Continue to hide.  
‚Äî Be careful, photo indiscretions are getting worse and worse, surveillance videos, and worse DNA tests. You will either have to get lost in remote areas or in dangerous megacities.  
‚Äî You understand, the danger that threatens me  
‚Äî Envy, jealousy, and medical laboratories.  
She's shivering, and I don't think the temperature is the cause.  

‚Äî I'm going to go...   

‚Äî Tt, tt, no name, no place, I told you how I was able to trace you through the words of people who knew you or through texts that cited you.  

 ‚Äî Noted, you must have had an interesting life.  

 ‚Äî Ha! ha! she still is.",2,1743525145.0,HFY,0,0.75,False

how do i reply? do i find a new salon? i like my stylist. help lmao

to add: no i dont wanna get her in trouble but i do want to figure out a way to decline and advise her not to do this again to others.

*Posted by* u/SufferingAtDCBasemen*t | 4:20 AM | 69 comments*

**üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION ALL UW/WLU STUDENTS, CO-OP OVERLORDS, AND SLEEP-DEPRIVED PHIL'S PATRONS üö®üö®üö®**

In a move so shocking it makes the Ion‚Äôs punctuality look¬†*almost*¬†acceptable,¬†**Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic**,¬†**Metrolinx CEO Michael Lindsay**,¬†**UW President of Suffering‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Vivek Goel**, and¬†**WLU President of ""We Also Exist""‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Deborah MacLatchy**¬†have reportedly joined forces in a clandestine midnight ritual at the Ion stop near Kitchener City Hall. Their goal? To finally bring¬†**GO Transit trains to KW every 30 minutes, 24/7, including weekends**‚Äîbecause apparently, someone finally realized students don‚Äôt vanish into the void after 7 PM.

**THE DETAILS (OR: HOW TO MAKE A STUDENT CRY TEARS OF JOY FOR ONCE)**

According to a leaked PDF discovered in the DC basement printer, the agreement includes:

* **Trains every 30 minutes, all day, all night, forever**. Yes, even during Reading Week. Yes, even during a snowstorm. Yes, even when you‚Äôre drunkenly sobbing into a poutine at 2 AM after failing your CS 350 midterm.
* **""No more 2-hour commutes to Toronto for co-op interviews!""**¬†screamed President Vivek Goel, while simultaneously emailing students to remind them that ""sleep is a privilege, not a right.""
* **A new ""GO Train Survival Kit""**¬†featuring free Tim Hortons coffee (lukewarm), a USB-C charger (broken), and a PDF of¬†*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*¬†(to use as a pillow).
* **Weekend service so reliable**, it‚Äôll make the Ion look like a toddler‚Äôs drawing of public transit.

**BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!**

Rumors suggest the deal was sealed only after:

1. Mayor Vrbanovic performed a TikTok dance to ‚ÄúBlame It on the Goose‚Äù atop a stalled Ion train.
2. Metrolinx promised to rename the Kitchener GO line the¬†**""LRT of Shame Express""**¬†in honor of Waterloo Region‚Äôs transit legacy.
3. Both Presidents signed a blood oath to never schedule exams before 11 AM on weekends (*Note: This is fake. Exams will still be at 8:30 AM*).

**REACTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY**

* u/GRT_Enthusiast69: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I see it. Remember when they said the Ion would be ‚Äòon time‚Äô?¬†**Pepperidge Farm remembers.**‚Äù
* u/LaurierIsBetterTBH: ‚ÄúTypical UW elitism. WLU students don‚Äôt need trains‚Äîwe have¬†**Spike‚Äôs ghost**¬†to teleport us to Toronto.‚Äù
* u/CS_Major_With_No_Lif*e*: ‚ÄúCool, but can the trains run on¬†**Python scripts**? Asking for a friend who‚Äôs 72 hours deep into a side project.‚Äù

**THE CATCH (BECAUSE THERE‚ÄôS ALWAYS A CATCH)**

Insiders report the fine print includes:

* Trains will only stop at¬†**UW Station**¬†if you solve a CAPTCHA proving you‚Äôre not a goose.
* **Fare integration**¬†with GRT‚Ä¶ meaning your WatCard now doubles as a Metrolinx ticket‚Ä¶¬†*and*¬†a meal plan.
* The 30-minute schedule is guaranteed unless Dean Tri needs to ‚Äú**optimize academic priorities**‚Äù (read: cancel trains during finals week).

**WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT?**

Construction begins ‚Äúsoon‚Äù (read: 2075) with phased rollout:

1. **Phase 1**: Trains from Kitchener to Toronto, but only for students with 90%+ averages (RIP).
2. **Phase 2**: A special ‚Äú**Exam Panic Express**‚Äù direct to Union Station, departing 1 hour before your midterm.
3. **Phase 3**: Dean MacLatchy personally pilots a locomotive while yelling¬†**‚ÄúWLU‚Äôs business program is STILL better!‚Äù**¬†over the intercom.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**

Is this real? Probably not. But for a brief, shining moment, we can dream of a world where escaping Waterloo doesn‚Äôt require a¬†**$120 Uber**, a prayer circle, or selling your soul to the co-op portal. Until then, keep refreshing the GO Transit schedule and blaming the Ion for your life choices.

**TL;DR**: Trains now vroom vroom. Deans still evil. Ion still late. Pray to the goose.",30,1743524601.0,uwaterloo,4,0.89,False

1jozq1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1jozq1d/where_to_save_where_to_spend/,Where to save where to spend?,"About to take on a full kitchen remodel. Our house was built in the early 90s and kitchen is orig /laminate counters, builder grade everything and pretty much falling apart.

The floors are engineered oak wood floors we have them throughout the house, but the kitchen floors are in bad shape from wear and tear and water damage from prev owners pets etc..

We took out a HE line for 100k, but this amount needs to include our kitchen, floors, a couple doors (deck and fire door to garage) and our very small master bath update (next year) so thinking 70% kitchen 30% master or thereabouts.

I attached pics which is a full 360 of the space with my pets and messy mess to boot :)

It is a standard L kitchen design, breakfast nook, small family room (glass window door leads to small deck)

The last pic closet looking door is our pantry (planning on removing to make more space and open that entrance into the kitchen a bit)

Goals are to rip out carpet in that small area and extend with same engineered wood. Then sand and finish. I assume we would be stupid not to sand and finish the next door room (dining and living not shown) because they merge together by my fridge you can see a little of my dining room. The other floor option is to go over the ENTIRE downstairs with LVP. Cost wise I have no clue what will be less, but having LVP in the entire downstairs bugs me, we have nice wood floors already that have never been sanded and finished. My worry is that this is going to eat a ton of the budget. **This is my first- is this worth the $? Thoughts?**

Our contractor is a close friend (home developer) and neighbor so we will have some savings as he most likely will not be marking everything up. My husband and I can do a lot of the ripping out/ carpet/cabinets, molding, we will do all the painting ourselves.

We want to remove the pantry and add a cabinet floor to ceiling style panty and a coffee bar area with open shelving above where that little fridge is.

Where do I save and where do I spend?

I want a simple scandi vibe with modern clean lines and basic white cabinets on top that go to the ceiling as well as some wooden open shelves maybe wooden cabinets on bottom.  White subway tile, a hood/vent in place of the microwave. I'd go ikea but we cant as we will be using the vendor our builder uses. Its not a big box like HD or Lowes but it is a huge local vendor that has several locations in our area of the state. They will have everything we could imagine from low to high end. My cupboard doors are literally falling off so anything will be better but I am hoping to stay away from MDF/particle board stuff. I also am hoping for a mix of wood (island/bar) and stone counters. I do not have to have marble or granite but hoping for a light natural stone. Where can I save in these areas and where should I be spending?

Keeping our fridge replacing range and dishwasher (Miele, Wolf, Bosch)

The dream is for a built in U shape in that nook with maybe a round table lots of cushions built in banquet. Seems $$$$$ no clue.

That small carpeted area is a family room that is and has always been awkward. Too small for us to hang out as a family and watch TV etc... That room is really just buying the right furniture. Biggest improvement for there is the floor.

This is a long post so if you made it this far thanks!!!! I'd love any insight. I may be completely thinking out of budget I really have no idea. What are the best places to spend and other places to save? I just know we won't do this again so trying to make sound decisions, but we don't have unlimited funds ( I have kids in college and more that need to still go!!!)
