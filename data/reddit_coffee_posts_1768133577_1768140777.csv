I just tried cold pressed with a double shot for the first time.  It was sweeter as expected, but it seemed to be milder and have less coffee flavor than a single shot hot latte. Is this normal?  

I don’t remember what grind size was suggested or what I used. I poured 8 ounces of cold foam on top. I saw a video (Just a Dad) where he poured the milk in first. I’m going to try that. I use locally roasted decaf beans.  ",1,1768140628.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,0,1.0,False
1qa092w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qa092w,Day 6: Food I ate and saw.,"Last day here. Went to the reliable Ta Ke E Sushi at Nijo Ichiba for breakfast. Was lucky to have slipped in at 1030ish without a line. Space is small, sits 6 and usually has a waiting list. Their prices have gone up over the years, but at ¥4200 (used to be only ¥3000!) for the 12-piece set, it's still very good value for the quality. Don't expect artisanal stuff and premium showmanship though, but it's one of the only 2 places I'd eat at the touristy Nijo Market.

Lunch was fine-dininng Italian at Saizeriya LOL. Jokes aside, back where I'm from (Singapore), Saizeriya can be hit-and-miss although value is still superb. In Japan though, the food quality is higher and place is packed when I went. Had the onion soup, chicken wings, garlic pasta and tiramisu. Enjoyed everything, especially the tiramisu. For just ¥300 it's one of the better ones I've had anywhere. Total meal came up to ¥1400 with free flow soft drinks, coffee and tea. Incredible.

Bought an Amaou strawberry drink from one of my favourite smoothie store. The reason I don't indulge more often is the price. The tiny cup cost ¥800. Really good, but also darn expensive. By now you should have realised I have a sweet tooth. Bought a snack back to the room, the Hokkaido Brown Cheese - one of the few snacks I've not had. It was alright, meringue and some cheese/caramel-ish mousse encased in chocolate. Didn't leave enough of an impression for me to repurchase.

Set aside ¥7000 for dinner and I proceeded to have yakiniku at Misono Susukino. Waited in the mini blizzard for about 40 minutes but was rewarded with one of the best meals I've had in Sapporo. Everything was good and the meat is high quality. Environment was traditional and cosy, although you'd most definitely leave with stench on your clothes. Got greedy as usual and over ordered, and bill came up to ¥9690 with 2 drinks. No regrets and fitting of a last meal.",1,1768140599.0,Sapporo,0,1.0,False
1qa07zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/1qa07zx/symptoms_but_negative_pregnancy_test/,"Symptoms, but negative pregnancy test","I thought I had my period on December 26th, but it only lasted a day. My periods are usually 3-5 days long. But I’ve been very irregular. My cycles have been ranging anywhere from 26 days to 36 days.

If that wasn’t an actual period, then the first day of my last period would be November 30th, which according to a due date calculator, that would put me at freshly 6 weeks as of today.

On January 2nd I puked in the morning. The  following days I had very bad acid reflux, indigestion, burning in my throat. Threw up again January 5th. Continued with awful reflux, nausea, indigestion. Threw up again January 8th. I didn’t have any other symptoms and the vomiting is so irregular, but the reflux and nausea is so persistent that it made me think I might be dealing with morning sickness and I didn’t have an actual period like I thought I did. I also started getting lightheaded and dizzy. I threw up again on January 10th.

I’ve been starting my mornings with breakfast crackers. I’ve been having ginger chews and saltines on hand, as well as ginger ale. I’ve been completely turned off by coffee, my comfort drink, it’s either too sweet, too bitter, just gross.

I’ve been having Pepcid in the morning and before bed. I’ve been sleeping elevated. I’ve been having bland meals, I’ve taken out acidic foods (except the coffee I’m trying to choke down to avoid caffeine withdrawal headaches.) I’ve been popping tums on my even more nauseous days, as a cherry on top.

I took a blue dye test in the evening on January 9th and got a very very faint positive. Followed the next morning with a still faint but more visible positive. But I’ve been told blue dye tests are not reliable, I followed with a pink dye test this morning (January 11th) the tests were clearly negative.

My period app says I would have ovulated on December 11th. The last time I had sex was December 5th. I’m not on birth control, hormonal and nonhormonal options don’t agree with me. We used condoms, but our first condom broke in the very beginning, which we immediately noticed and replaced. I didn’t think I could be pregnant initially, now I don’t think I’m pregnant due to negative tests.

But I can’t help be feel confused because everything lines up so perfectly. If I use November 30th as my last period, my nausea started right around when I would have hit 5 weeks.

Does anyone have any insight? All the reliable tests come back negative, I know they should be coming back strongly positive at this point, but I can’t help but feel like I’m being duped.",1,1768140518.0,amipregnant,1,1.0,False

Recently it has been a lot of dry texting and has felt very strange. Recently, everything I discuss to her about has been met with attitude and has been making me feel as if i'm stupid no matter what question. Everything used to be great.

I got along with her family, always together, etc. But recently things have changed like i've said before.

About 2 weeks or so ago, a close friend and I went to a coffee shop to talk about our lives and catch up.

When I arrived they were talking to someone that worked there. She (19F) was a close friend of my friends. After a little bit of chatting between us three I got her contact info and we talked a little bit more.

Recently, more and more, we talked a significant amount and were getting along really well with her.

The problem now lays that I cannot stop thinking about her. As much as I tell myself I'm in a happy relationship, something will not let me not think about them and I don't know what to do or how to confront this. Everything I do on a day to day recently they popped up in some way. I need help, what do I even do about something like this?

I can offer Portuguese or Spanish, and I’m also happy to do a tandem just in English if that works for you.   
Just to be clear upfront: this is not about dating. I’m happily in a long-term relationship and only looking for a language exchange.

1qa0543,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiataND/comments/1qa0543/dad_review_of_nd3_rf_mt_for_people_post/,Dad review of ND3 RF MT for people post surgery/arthritis.,"Got to drive my son's ND3 RF MT 2.0 Exclusive Line (equiv Grand Touring trim) in Soul Red Crystal for the first time.

My main concern is I had major cancer surgery several years ago that can make using a clutch very painful, so had to switch to a DCT automatic.

Great news the clutch is so light that I have no discomfort after a 40min drive in the city then out on the twisty UK 60mph B roads.

Steering is precise and has some weight, but did not aggrivate my arthritis. The manual 6 speed is a little firm when cold but soon warms up.

I had not driven a manual car for over 2 years, so was expecting some stalls and less than perfect gear shifts, but everything in the car just works so well together I had zero issues, which was a relief to the owner.

While the car is very low I am fine with my feet on the ground for getting in and out.

With my feet on kerb/pavement (UK)/sidewalk it's not comfortable and can feel it in my knees.

I am 5ft 9in (174cm) same as my son just different leg length, no head room issues as expected. Driving position is set for son, I just needed to put seat all the way back and adjust the mirrors.

Back pain, suspension is factory Bilstein dampers setup with standard seats and I had no issues even over bumps, pot holes and cobblestones.

Noise level, it's quieter with the roof up than my daily Kia, roof down I didn't mind the wind noise at 60mph,  which I was expecting it to be so much worse with the RF.

Storage space, better than a motorcycle, just enough in the cabin for phone, wallet, keys, hat and a water/coffee cup.

The boot/trunk is actually not bad for light shopping and squashy bags, along lines of carry on or what I would take on a train.

Fuel consumption for our drive was 41mpg UK imperial, about 34.1 mpg (US) and about 6.9 L/100 km.

Impression of speed, it always feels faster compared to normal cars at a given speed. The speedo and tacho are super clear so easy to check.

Is it slow/fast? no. You won't care.

Still 5.5s 0-60mph (car and driver) is very quick, the quoted 0-62mph (100km/h) times have an extra gearshift into 3rd to go over 60mph.

Fun cars.

Most of my social circle is work related or friends abroad that I hang out with online. I want to change that in a relaxed way without forcing friendships.

The idea is a very chilled activities based group. Nothing compulsory. Examples could be hiking one day, lunch another, go karting, or even just working from a coffee shop together. I already work(remotely) from a coffee shop at least once a week by honey dew so anyone would be welcome to join.

If you are free and interested you show up. If not no pressure at all.

This is for mature, like minded people who respect boundaries. Communication stays in the group. Private chats are at your own discretion. No expectations and no drama.

If this resonates with you comment or DM me. If there is enough interest we can decide the best platform for the group.

1q9zyku,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGU/comments/1q9zyku/question/,Question,"So I have a memory that has been something of a mystery to me for many years. I am Machinist by trade, and during my apprenticeship years I worked for an Aerospace  facility in Southwest Michigan. Every day there was an enormous tankard of community coffee in the break room. I don’t like community coffee for a litany of reasons not least of which are the taste. Is it just me, or are others the same way; coffee is kinda like sex in that even bad coffee is still pretty good coffee. The community coffee area had these little plastic molded rings with a handle that held little plastic inserts that were a cup, so you could reuse the ring and just toss the tapered cylinder portion of it. This was an old design that was made to get around the complexity of the molds, dies, and machinery you would need to run them, in a mass production situation. The tapered cylinder shape was much easier and more cost effective to mass produce than the complex geometries you would need to Machine into the dies and molds to make the handle features that blend into the Y/Z plane of the reservoirs portion. These little cups put me onto an incredible mystery, (That’s probably not THAT much of a mystery) but I thought it was good material for the group. When you fill these little cups, very often they are filled to the brim. If I remember correctly they had a six ounce volume so that’s precisely 2/3 of a drink of coffee you are me or Steve. If you are a machinist, (or any other professional ftm) there’s never enough time in the day so you’re always walking too far in front of your feet to be carrying a spill-able load so I would creep as I watched the cup, and it was very awkwardly hot so there was no just sipping off the excess to secure the load before accelerating. 
    One day one of the old pros, saw me doing this. I don’t think he would mind me saying his name but this is the internet so we will just call him G. Ol G was a mastermind of cultural, scientific, and creative knowledge & instincts that I could only ever dream of maybe standing in the shadow of. And when he saw me, he didn’t say anything right then, he waited until it came up in conversation. I don’t know if this was intentional or it just happened that way, but my instincts tell me that G knew what he was doing. Later that day, (because we were working closely) He made a joke about there not being enough time, because of the coffee cups. He said it took him 20 years to figure out if you just don’t look at it you won’t spill it. 

Ok G. 

Hilarious but cmon. Man. Eventually I did put my pride aside and give it the ol College try, as we skeptics are wont to do. And, for some reason, despite Mr G’s legendary pedigree, I was surprised as shit. You absolutely will not spill the coffee that’s brimming under normal movement, if you simply don’t look at it. 

Someone help me understand, I’m a Machinist not a neurologist, so I may need more help than normal people😆  Also can someone explain to me why when I’m editing this post I’m reading it in Jay’s voice!?? This has to stop. Thanks y’all. Big Love! ",1,1768139836.0,SGU,0,1.0,False

Not good.

I want Claude to be my right hand man. Here’s what I do:

1. I use Claude Projects where I have project-specific context for each project (super awesome now that Claude can remember between chats in the same project).

So when I work on my side hustle, Claude knows what it is, why and when I started it, what my goals are, previous failures, etc.

When I do client works - Claude knows who’s the client, what’s my agreement with that client and how much I’m getting paid for how much work. He knows who the team is, their roles etc (so he can be like “cool this text seems polished enough send it to Anna to publish on the site” etc).

2. Then I have Claude connected to my google drive where I have a main Claude context folder, with everything that’s global in my work and relevant across projects -  starting with my “career autobiography” (context-rich CV) to my tone-of-writing-style-guide etc.

This is why Claude can give me great advice about productivity, juggling my various projects, focusing on the right thing, and do a lot of my tasks for me.

I'll talk to his vet obviously when I see him next but wanting to see if anyone has something specific I can bring up. I am a VA and we have one particular vet at our GP that does sonography so that's who I have seeing this specific kitty. 

General history: fat cat with IBD/allergy issues. Adopted in 2024, 18lbs BCS 9/9.  Might have asthma but has never had an attack or needed Albuterol, I took him home and quickly learned I can't light candles or spray aerosols anymore. Has been on pred multiple times for itchy skin, fur loss, rodent ulcers.  Trialed atopica and he got quite sick on it. Also episodes of varying anorexia and vomiting and diarrhea. AUS showed thickened small intestinal walls.  Diet change has so far been very effective for the skin and GI but he still acts like he's starving all of the time and constantly tries to eat random things. Gets bilious vomiting after only 6-8 hrs without food. 

He's on the royal canin hydrolyzed/satiety blend. 14.2lbs 7-8/9 BCS today.
My real current concern is the constant compulsive needing to ingest something all of the time. We are still on a weight loss goal and the need to lose weight is complicated by the constant ""I need to eat"" signal going on. 

The satiety food does not satiate. Last time I talked to his vet he said in theory, he could have 1 whole cup of that food daily. Increase to that if he's always hungry. But he seems to just be maintaining at this amount and not losing anymore. I've purchased a microchip auto feeder (multiple cats, currently he just has a regular microchip feeder not an autofeeder) hoping that if he gets a bunch of tiny meals everyday that helps, it should stop the bilious vomiting at least. but the issue is he will eat his meal and then immediately run off to eat something else. It doesn't matter if his stomach is physically full or not. 
 
I know cats have a rep for being dramatic for food but this guy literally panics when his bowl gets empty. I wake up at 6am everyday whether I want to or not because he screams and chews my hair and circles me and screams until I go feed him breakfast, Ill pee and brush my teeth and let the dog out first and he just screeches the whole time. And then he finishes his breakfast and starts circling the coffee table and licking the floor because I ate a muffin. I feed one of my cats in my bedroom and he was in there licking the dresser I keep that kibble in. Recently the plaster on my wall was chipping away and I caught him vomiting up plaster pieces! He is just constantly foraging and he is such a high risk for ingesting something stupid that will kill him. Like I'm not starving him but he certainly can't just have the bowl filled up 24/7 and we want him down to 11lbs. 

I should also add that his lab work is perfect. No diabetes no kidney disease no hyperthyroidism. I've double, triple checked the thyroid because of the ravenous behavior. He also drinks a lot a lot of water and I'm thinking now that's also a compulsive thing. Although at least he's always well hydrated...

I have trouble pulling consistent shots when pulling multiples shots at once. The consistency is about pulling time for a certain grind size. I have a DF54 as grinder.

The first shot is always consistent. With the same grind size and bean, each first shot everyday is taking about the same time.

But when I pull the second shot, right after the first one, the second shot takes MUCH more time, usually for a 1:2 ratio, 45-50 seconds for second shot against 28-35 seconds for the first shot.

Routine :  
\- Turn on machine  
\- Wait green led while grinding 32g of coffee  
\- put 16g of the 32g coffee in the original rancilio 16g basket  
\- pull first shot with just tamping  
\- Clean evrything  
\- Let water drip to enable the boiler to heat again  
\- Once greens led returns pull second with remaining 16g shot with just tamping

2nd shot ALWAYS takes an eternity to drip and ends up ruined. My workaround for now is to grind the seconds shot a bit coarser but I can not have any kind of consistency....

1q9zuva,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1q9zuva/vpn_usage_statistics_by_country/,VPN Usage Statistics by Country,"VPN Usage Statistics by Country 2026: Global Adoption Rates & Market Data

Your neighbor probably uses a VPN. So does your coworker. Maybe even your parents.

VPNs have exploded from niche tech tools into everyday privacy essentials, with **1.75 billion people worldwide** now routing their internet through encrypted tunnels. That's roughly one in three internet users globally—a staggering shift from just a few years back when VPNs were mostly the domain of IT professionals and privacy enthusiasts.

But here's what's interesting: VPN adoption isn't spread evenly across the globe. Some countries see usage rates above 55%, while others barely crack 5%. The reasons why matter—and they tell us a lot about privacy, censorship, and how people actually use the internet in different parts of the world.

Let me break down the numbers and show you exactly where VPNs are taking off, who's using them, and what's driving this massive global shift.

# Global VPN Market: The Numbers That Matter

The VPN industry isn't just growing—it's exploding. Market projections vary depending on the source, but the trajectory is clear: massive expansion driven by privacy concerns, remote work, and content access needs.

Here's what the data shows:

|Market Metric|Current Value|Projected Value|Growth Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Global VPN Users|1.75-1.9 billion|2.1 billion by year-end|15-20% YoY|
|Market Value|$88.96 billion|$534 billion by 2034|22% CAGR|
|Enterprise Adoption|93% of organizations|Increasing|Growing reliance|
|US Users|42% of internet users|\~105 million people|10M new users expected|

💡 **Pro Tip:** When you see wildly different market projections ($70B vs. $500B), it's usually because sources are measuring different segments—some track only consumer VPNs, others include enterprise solutions and cloud VPN infrastructure.

The variation in these numbers tells a story. Different research firms segment the market differently, but what's consistent? **Growth rates between 11-22% annually.** That's not normal software market growth. That's demand driven by fundamental shifts in how we work and what we expect from our digital privacy.

# Top Countries by VPN Adoption: Who's Leading the Charge?

Want to know where VPNs matter most? Look at countries with either strict internet controls or populations that really value privacy (or both).

Indonesia tops the charts. Not the US. Not China. Indonesia.

# Highest VPN Adoption Rates by Country

|Country|VPN Usage Rate|Primary Driver|Population Impact|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|🏆 Indonesia|55-61%|Government censorship of ""negative content""|\~150M users|
|Qatar|59%|Content restrictions, expatriate access|High per-capita adoption|
|India|43-56%|Privacy concerns, content access|403M users (largest by volume)|
|UAE|42-52%|Strict content laws, streaming access|Wealthy user base|
|Russia|37-41%|Government surveillance, censorship|319M users|
|United States|42%|Privacy awareness, streaming, remote work|\~105M users|
|Malaysia|38-43%|Regional content blocking|Growing adoption|
|Thailand|38-43%|Entertainment access, privacy|Steady growth|
|Vietnam|45%|Government monitoring|High youth adoption|
|Singapore|19-35%|Business use, cross-border access|High-value users|

⚠️ **Warning:** High VPN usage doesn't always mean a country values privacy—it often signals the opposite. When you see 55%+ adoption rates, that's usually people trying to escape government censorship, not just accessing Netflix.

What surprised me in this data? The US sits at 42%—roughly matching Indonesia and Russia despite completely different motivations. Americans use VPNs mostly for privacy and streaming. Indonesians and Russians? They're bypassing government blocks just to access social media or news sites.

# China: The Volume Leader

China doesn't top the percentage charts (estimated 29% adoption due to strict VPN restrictions), but it's the volume king with **over 319 million VPN users**. Think about that—China alone accounts for nearly one-fifth of global VPN users despite the government's aggressive crackdown on VPN services.

The Great Firewall makes VPN use technically illegal without government approval, yet millions of Chinese citizens still find ways to access the open internet. That's how strong the demand is.

# Regional Breakdown: VPN Adoption Patterns Across Continents

VPN usage isn't just about individual countries—regional patterns reveal broader trends in privacy concerns, internet freedom, and digital behavior.

# Asia-Pacific: The Adoption Powerhouse

Asia-Pacific dominates both in absolute numbers and growth rates. The region accounts for roughly 25% of global VPN market share and contains the three largest VPN markets by user count.

**Why Asia leads:**

* **Massive populations** in India, China, Indonesia create enormous user bases
* **Government censorship** drives necessity-based adoption
* **Mobile-first internet access** makes VPN apps natural downloads
* **Growing middle class** with disposable income for paid services

The region's projected growth rate of 19-25% CAGR through 2030 outpaces every other region.

# Middle East: High Adoption, Restrictive Environment

Countries like Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia show some of the world's highest per-capita VPN adoption rates, but it's a double-edged sword.

|Middle East Country|VPN Usage|Legal Status|Primary Use Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Qatar|\~59%|Restricted|Streaming, VoIP services|
|UAE|42-52%|Restricted|Content access, privacy|
|Saudi Arabia|11-44%|Restricted|Social media, streaming|

The Middle East paradox: High VPN adoption despite legal restrictions. Using a VPN isn't outright illegal in most Gulf states, but it occupies a gray area. Governments tolerate VPN use for legitimate business purposes but crack down on circumventing content blocks.

# North America: Privacy-Driven Growth

North America (primarily the US and Canada) shows different adoption drivers than Asia or the Middle East.

**US VPN Market Specifics:**

* **42% adoption rate** among internet users
* **\~105 million active users** currently
* **Split usage:** 50% personal privacy, 50% work/business
* **Growth spike:** 827% increase during COVID-19 pandemic
* **Age verification laws** in multiple states driving new surges

The US market is mature but still expanding. What changed? Awareness. Americans who didn't think twice about privacy five years ago now understand ISPs can sell their browsing data, advertisers track everything, and streaming services block content by region.

# Europe: Lower Adoption, Higher Awareness

Europe shows surprisingly low VPN adoption rates given the region's strong privacy culture and GDPR protections.

**European VPN Adoption:**

* **Netherlands:** \~10%
* **France:** \~7%
* **Germany:** 6-15% (varies by source)
* **UK:** Rising sharply due to Online Safety Act age verification

Why so low despite strong privacy regulations? Partly because GDPR already provides significant protections, reducing the urgent need for VPNs. But that's changing fast.

The UK's Online Safety Act triggered explosive VPN growth in 2025. Proton VPN reported a **1,400% surge in daily UK sign-ups** when age verification requirements hit major websites. NordVPN saw **1,000% spikes** in UK purchases. When governments force ID uploads for internet access, people find workarounds.

# Demographics: Who Actually Uses VPNs?

VPN users aren't a monolithic group. Age, gender, income, and device preferences create distinct user segments.

# Gender Distribution

|Gender|VPN Users|Change Over Time|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Male|54%|Down from 62%|
|Female|46%|Up from 38%|

The gender gap is closing. Back in 2017, male users outnumbered females 62% to 38%. Now it's nearly even at 54/46. VPNs have moved from tech-heavy tools to mainstream privacy utilities used by everyone.

# Age Groups: Millennials Lead

**1 in 5 users aged 25-34** use VPNs regularly—the highest adoption rate of any age group. This makes sense: millennials grew up digital-native but came of age before privacy became a mainstream concern. They're now privacy-conscious adults with spending power.

Other age breakdowns:

* **18-24:** High mobile usage, often free VPNs
* **35-44:** Strong work/business usage
* **45-54:** Growing adoption, privacy-focused
* **55+:** Lower but increasing awareness

# Device Preferences: Mobile Catches Up

Desktop used to dominate VPN usage, but mobile has nearly caught up.

**Current device split:**

* **Desktop/Laptop:** 72-75% of users
* **Smartphones:** 61-69% of users
* **Tablets:** 33% of users

Notice something? The percentages add up to more than 100%. That's because most VPN users protect **multiple devices**. The average VPN subscriber now secures 3-4 devices across desktops, phones, and tablets.

📌 **Key Takeaway:** Mobile VPN usage has exploded from a niche use case to 61% of all VPN connections. Why? Public WiFi paranoia and constant connectivity make phone protection feel essential.

# Free vs. Paid VPNs: The Reality Check

Here's where things get messy. Roughly **44-50% of VPN users** rely solely on free services.

That's... not great. Let me be blunt about this.

**The free VPN problem:**

* Many free VPNs **sell your browsing data** to advertisers
* They often **inject ads** into your web traffic
* **Security vulnerabilities** are common
* **Speed throttling** makes them barely usable
* Some are outright **malware distribution** schemes

Free VPNs survive by monetizing users. You're not the customer—you're the product being sold. The whole point of using a VPN (privacy, security) gets undermined when the VPN provider is selling your data.

**US Market Split:**

* **44.2%** use free VPNs
* **51.2%** pay for premium services
* Remaining **4.6%** use corporate/employer-provided VPNs

Globally, the split leans slightly more toward free services (\~50%), but market trends show a slow migration toward paid providers as awareness of free VPN risks spreads.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** You don't need to pay $10+/month for a good VPN. Premium services like NordVPN, Surfshark, and Proton VPN regularly offer 2-year plans for $2-4/month—less than the cost of two coffees while providing actual privacy protection.

# Why People Use VPNs: The Motivations Behind the Numbers

Google Trends reveals what drives VPN searches globally. The breakdown might surprise you.

# Primary VPN Use Cases (Global)

|Use Case|Share of Searches|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Work/Remote Access|50%|Remote work explosion post-pandemic|
|Privacy/Security|22-78%\*|Varies by region and event|
|Streaming/Entertainment|26-62%\*|Geo-unblocking Netflix, sports|
|Bypassing Censorship|22%+|Critical in restrictive countries|
|Gaming|10-15%|DDoS protection, latency reduction|

\*Percentages vary significantly based on region and current events. Privacy spikes after data breaches; entertainment dominates in unrestricted countries.

⚡ **Performance Insight:** Work-related VPN usage jumped to 50% of all searches after COVID-19 forced remote work. Before the pandemic, entertainment (geo-unblocking Netflix) dominated at 62% of use cases. The shift is permanent—hybrid work isn't going away.

What's interesting here? The **massive regional variation**. In the US and Europe, people primarily use VPNs for privacy and streaming. In Indonesia, Russia, or China? Censorship circumvention tops the list. The tool is the same, but the motivation is completely different.

# Enterprise VPN Adoption: The Business Side

While consumer VPNs get the headlines, enterprise VPN usage tells a different story about remote work and cybersecurity.

**Enterprise VPN Statistics:**

* **93% of organizations** worldwide now use VPN services
* **74% of remote-friendly companies** require VPNs for internal systems
* **68% of US organizations** enforce VPN usage for hybrid work models
* **Enterprise VPNs** will contribute **55% of total VPN revenue** through 2026

The business case is simple: remote workers need secure access to company networks, and VPNs remain the standard solution despite emerging alternatives like Zero Trust architectures.

🔒 **Security Note:** Enterprise VPNs and consumer VPNs serve different purposes. Corporate VPNs connect employees to company networks. Consumer VPNs protect your personal browsing from ISPs and trackers. Don't expect your work VPN to provide personal privacy—it doesn't.

# Countries Where VPNs Are Banned or Restricted

VPN bans tell us a lot about government priorities. The list isn't long, but it's telling.

**Countries with VPN restrictions:**

* **China:** Partial ban (only government-approved VPNs allowed)
* **Russia:** Heavy restrictions, increased blocking
* **Iran:** Banned except for government-approved services
* **UAE:** Legal gray area, restricted for illegal activities
* **Turkey:** Intermittent blocks during political events
* **North Korea:** Complete ban
* **Iraq:** Banned
* **Oman:** Restricted
* **Belarus:** Increasing restrictions
* **Turkmenistan:** Banned

Notice the pattern? Authoritarian governments that restrict press freedom also restrict VPN access. Shocking, right?

But here's what matters: **Bans don't work.** Russia ""banned"" VPNs but still has 37-41% usage. China has massive VPN adoption despite aggressive crackdowns. When people need access to uncensored information, they find ways.

# VPN Market Projections: Where This Industry Is Heading

Multiple research firms project explosive VPN market growth, though specific numbers vary wildly.

# Market Size Projections (Various Sources)

|Source|2025/2026 Projection|2030-2034 Projection|CAGR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Precedence Research|$88.96B → $108.57B|$534B by 2034|22%|
|Grand View Research|$48.50B|$151.92B by 2030|17.7%|
|Global Growth Insights|$3.02B|$7.92B by 2035|11.3%|
|FindCheapVPNs|$76B by 2026|—|17.4%|
|Market Research Future|—|$147.43B by 2033|13.3%|

Why such huge variations? Different firms measure different segments. Some track only consumer VPNs. Others include enterprise infrastructure, cloud VPNs, and managed services. The broadest definitions (like Precedence Research's $534B projection) include all VPN-related security technology.

What's consistent across all projections? **Double-digit growth rates.** Whether it's 11% or 22%, the industry is expanding at rates most mature software markets can only dream about.

# Cloud VPN: The Fastest-Growing Segment

Cloud-based VPN deployment is exploding separately from traditional VPN growth.

**Cloud VPN Market:**

* **$13.05 billion** market size
* **$36.45 billion** projected by 2030
* **22.8% CAGR** outpacing traditional VPN growth
* **Hybrid cloud deployments** growing at 24.2% CAGR

Cloud VPNs integrate with SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) platforms and support multi-cloud strategies, driving enterprise adoption beyond traditional perimeter-based security.

# The COVID-19 Effect: Pandemic as VPN Catalyst

The pandemic didn't create VPN demand—it supercharged existing trends.

**Pre-pandemic VPN landscape:**

* \~7% global adoption (2016)
* Niche tool for tech-savvy users
* Entertainment-focused use cases dominated

**Post-pandemic reality:**

* 31-33% global adoption
* Mainstream privacy essential
* Work/security use cases dominate

Specific COVID impacts:

* **785 million VPN downloads** in 2021 vs. 277 million in 2020
* **68% of businesses** increased VPN usage during lockdowns
* **29% of businesses** used VPNs for the first time
* **124% usage surge** in the US during pandemic peak

The work-from-home shift created overnight demand for secure remote access. Companies that never considered VPNs suddenly needed them to function. That genie isn't going back in the bottle.

# Recent Events Driving VPN Spikes: Legislative Triggers

VPN adoption doesn't grow smoothly—it jumps in response to specific events.

# Notable VPN Surge Events

**UK Online Safety Act (July 2025):**

* **1,400% spike** in Proton VPN UK sign-ups
* **1,000% increase** in NordVPN UK purchases
* Age verification requirements triggered privacy backlash

**Russia-Ukraine War (2022):**

* Global VPN interest skyrocketed
* Russian users sought uncensored news access
* Secure communication became critical

**Edward Snowden NSA Revelations (2013):**

* First major consumer VPN awareness spike
* Privacy concerns entered mainstream consciousness

**Various US State Age Verification Laws:**

* Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Utah implementations
* Each triggered local VPN download surges
* Pornhub site blocks drove VPN adoption

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Legislative overreach drives VPN adoption faster than any marketing campaign. When governments force ID uploads or block websites, people find workarounds—usually within 24 hours.

# Platform Distribution: Operating Systems and VPN Usage

Not all platforms show equal VPN adoption.

**VPN Usage by Operating System:**

* **Windows:** Dominant enterprise and personal use
* **macOS:** Strong privacy-conscious user base
* **iOS:** 61% of mobile VPN users (high-quality demographic)
* **Android:** Higher total volume, mixed free/paid split
* **Linux:** Niche but growing (privacy enthusiasts)

Mobile platforms now account for **over 61% of global VPN usage**, a complete reversal from the desktop-dominated early days.

# The Privacy Paradox: What VPN Statistics Really Tell Us

Here's what keeps me up at night about these numbers: **50% of VPN users choose free services.**

That means hundreds of millions of people trying to protect their privacy are using tools that actively undermine it. Free VPN providers have been caught:

* Selling user browsing data to advertisers
* Injecting tracking cookies
* Serving malware
* Operating as honeypots for data collection

The VPN industry has a massive education problem. People understand they need privacy protection but don't understand how VPNs actually work or how to evaluate them.

# Regional Market Leaders: Who's Dominating Where?

Different VPN providers dominate different markets based on local needs, marketing, and features.

**Market presence by provider type:**

* **NordVPN:** Strong US/Europe presence, enterprise crossover
* **Surfshark:** Budget-conscious markets, rapid growth
* **ExpressVPN:** Premium tier, high-income demographics
* **Proton VPN:** Privacy enthusiasts, European market
* **CyberGhost:** Strong European presence
* **Private Internet Access:** US market focus

📌 **Key Takeaway:** No single VPN dominates globally. Regional preferences vary based on local privacy laws, content access needs, and price sensitivity. What works in Singapore doesn't necessarily work in Brazil.

# Future Trends: Where VPN Usage Is Heading

Several trends will shape VPN adoption over the next few years:

**1. Post-Quantum Encryption Rollout** VPN providers are implementing post-quantum cryptography to protect against future quantum computing threats. NordVPN already deployed it; others are following.

**2. AI-Powered Traffic Optimization** Machine learning algorithms optimize server selection and routing for better speeds without sacrificing privacy.

**3. SASE Platform Integration** Enterprise VPNs are merging into broader Secure Access Service Edge platforms that combine VPN, firewall, and zero-trust capabilities.

**4. Regulatory Battles** More countries will attempt VPN restrictions, driving innovation in obfuscation technology and driving usage higher through Streisand Effect.

**5. Mobile-First Design** VPN interfaces are evolving from desktop-first to mobile-first as smartphone usage dominates.

# What These Statistics Mean for You

All this data boils down to a few key points:

**If you're in a restricted country:** VPN usage is necessity-driven. Your privacy and access to information depend on it. Choose providers with strong obfuscation features and a track record of working in restrictive environments.

**If you're in an open internet country:** VPN usage is choice-driven. Your decision to use one reflects privacy values and content access desires. Focus on speed, reliability, and verified no-logs policies.

**If you're considering a free VPN:** Don't. Seriously. The privacy risks outweigh any cost savings. Premium VPNs cost $2-4/month on annual plans—less than a streaming service you probably don't watch.

**If you run a business:** Enterprise VPN usage isn't optional anymore. 93% of organizations use them. Remote work made VPNs critical infrastructure, not optional security theater.

# The Real Story Behind the Numbers

VPN statistics reveal something bigger than market growth or user counts. They show how people around the world respond to surveillance, censorship, and loss of privacy.

When Indonesia's government blocks social media, 55% of citizens install VPNs. When the UK forces ID uploads for website access, VPN downloads spike 1,400%. When companies force employees to work remotely, VPN usage becomes standard practice.

The 1.75 billion VPN users worldwide aren't a monolithic group. They're Indonesian students accessing banned educational sites, American remote workers connecting to corporate networks, Russian journalists accessing uncensored news, and British citizens refusing to upload IDs to watch content.

My wife is breastfeeding. She needs a lot more calories than I do. As a result she usually has a snack after dinner. However, she doesn't like to eat alone. She's also a little self conscious about eating 4-5 meals a day. The conversation usually goes: ""oh if I have ___ will you have some too?"" And if I say no, she's not going to have it, and she'll wake up hangry at like 5am. 



Or when I'm out with parents for a walk with our kids, they'll suggest we get coffee and/or little sweet treats as a destination of the outing/walk. I have very good coffee that I like at home. I don't want to spend $4 on a mediocre burnt black coffee, so it'll likely be a latte or cappuccino.

‘Oh, I’m here if you want to talk’ Jessie motioned for the check and saw the waiter nod.

‘Thanks, but talking to you would most likely make things worse’ Sara leaned back her face a portrait of tired and worn.

‘True that, I can’t keep secrets or lie to people’

‘Did you catch that cat you mentioned the other day?’ Sara asked.

‘Nah he keeps evading my love’ Jessie leaned back as well and muttered under her breath. ‘Like all the men I fancy’

Jessie could see Sara pretend not to hear, but one corner of her mouth curled up in the hint of a smile, she really loves the fact that I can’t land a man. They parted ways at the front, but Sara waited till she got in the taxi and probably took a note of the license plate, everyone around her had become so paranoid of late, as if Jessie had started to attract trouble or something.

Back home she sent a text to Sara that she was home now and went straight into the shower, when she got out it was around three p.m, got dressed and went into the living room and looked out the window to see the cat run into the alley, jackpot. She got the tuna can, opened it and placed it inside the carrier on a piece of cardboard and went down, outside she sneaked into the alley and saw the cat a bit further in so she placed the carrier next to the dumpster and got back up, sneaked towards the road, and remembered, she forgot the string to close the door when the cat went inside,“why are you like this Jessie” she asked herself.

The black cat approached the carrier slowly and sat across from it before slowly walking inside, Jessie waited for it to finish eating and leave, fifteen minutes passed and wondered if the cat had already left while she wasn’t paying attention, only to walk over to find it asleep. Carefully and slowly closed the door and picked up the carrier, the cat was still asleep.

Searched online for the location of the nearest vet and took a car to the place, explained the entire situation and they went to work immediately, no judgment from that it was a stray and that she had only brought it here to help him and let him go afterwards when he was healthy, vets are kind of amazing because they don’t really care at all as long as the animal is being helped.

She waited outside going through her phone, chatting with Max and Sara and letting them know that she had brought the cat to the vet. It took four hours and the bill came up to two thousand dollars, which she didn’t really care for, as this was an important use of her money for Jessie, plus the last time she checked her heart couldn’t take the amount that was in her accounts, dad had deposited a lot over the years, and she being an air head never looked closely, if the card worked and she didn’t move past half her salary when she was working at the bakery, that was good enough as that meant there should be enough of a fall back on the months she moved past her target expenses.

The doctor came with the cat already in the carrier and told her he should be in a pretty bad mood now because of all the needles and she looked inside to see one of his back legs in a cast.

‘His leg was broken?’ Jessie asked surprised, he was running today.

‘They can walk, run and appear normal even with a fracture, sometimes the only tell tale signs being a slight limp, being feral they have to hide any weaknesses’ He handed over the carrier to her. ‘Thank you for bringing her’

‘I would keep her if my roommate wasn’t afraid honestly, I like how she looks, reminds me of my roommates partner’ Jessie laughed, the cat stared at her with that stony annoyed look.

At home she left the carrier door open and her room door closed to get the cat to come out, she did not and Jessie took a risk and placed her hand inside slowly.

‘Ow’ Jessie winced and looked at three red lines on the back of her hand. ‘You are a meany cat, right, I am going to call you Black Bully’

Max provided first aid when she came out, cleaned the claw marks with some antiseptic solution, after that she just laid on the sofa dejected that the cat hated her and Max went on to prepare dinner and set the table.

‘Please do not let the cat out of your room Jess’ Max shivered. ‘Why are they so, so cute and so angry’

‘I won’t, when he gets fat, gonna let him go, also I named him Bby’ Jessie laid back and moved her arms back and forth in the air like a dance, the air moving across the cuts made it tingle.

‘Baby?’

‘No, not baby, its black bully shortened to B.B.Y, so Bby’ She told Max matter of factly.

‘So baby, got it’ Max sat down and waved.

‘Coming Max my darling huge amazon beauty beyond worlds’ Jessie twirled once and sat down to eat.

‘All right, all right, you don’t have to butter me up that much, next week all the meals are yours’

‘Okay, okay,dreams destroyed’

‘Hmm, eat and go sleep, don’t let the baby eat you though’ Max started eating but Jessie was frozen staring at her plate.

‘Can I sleep with you till Bby gets better’ Jessie asked and Max stopped eating.

‘Yeah, cats are scary, come’ Max resumed eating, She had expected a different response but the fear is strong in her.

‘Yey! Sleepover’ Jessie grinned and ate while humming.

\#

Cats are noisy, smelly, unpredictable and Jessie finally admitted to herself that she only liked them from a distance in which she was not allowed to be responsible for one, because when you place the one and the two together in the same room, Jessie a bit of a temperamental personality herself that mirrored this annoying cat, this black bully, bby for short, and two of the same can’t exist in the same space without conflict.

This was a week later and a Saturday morning, she found herself standing in the doorway of her room, the smell of cat pee and her other higher bodily function was a staple smell of this room now, when Bby was a little fatter she was going back out to live in the wide, wide world again, having feral cats out were not good she knew but there was no option and no one wanted to take a cat, a feral untrained one at that, so that was the last option, not a happy or a good one, but there is only so much she can do for this Bby that still attacked her when she got near, and to top off this annoyance was that Bby liked Max, and sneaks out to go beg and ask for pets from her and lays on her lap while Max keeps sweating from her panic and anxiety but she still does let her sleep and ask Jessie to remove her when Bby starts snoring, the insubordination of this affection towards someone who is afraid of her was paramount, she half knew what that meant but it sounded accurate enough to convey her feelings.

Food in the bowl, water bowl cleaned, litter box cleaned, Jessie closed the door and went to take a shower to get the smell of her room out of her hair, grooming herself to perfection was a laborious task that she wondered once a month if doing all this could be outsourced to another country, there was the normal stuff and then at the end come her coils of wonder (Horror), she called them, artistically arranging them takes an hour. An hour later after the shower Jessie came out of the bathroom to hear knocking on the front door.

She opened it to find Sara, dressed lightly for the weekend.

‘Want me to go golfing with you?’ Jessie said mockingly, hand over her mouth to hide her snickering.

‘Jobless losers can’t afford golf the last time I checked’ Sara walked in past her, took off her shoes and slipped on her private loafers for the apartment.

‘That is no way to address a fine lady such as myself, furthermore a delicate flower such as I will most likely be courted and taken to golf for free by a gentlemen, HMPH!’ Jessie spun around dramatically and marched to the living room.

‘Max still sleeping?’ Sara asked going straight for the mornings coffee pot.

‘Maximum asleep’ and right after saying that Jessie wondered if Max was awake, if she woke up to someone using her full name, the rest of the day is ruined, she could see the same thought process walking across Sara’s face.

‘Don’t’ was her ask while she slowly walked over to the couch.

‘Bit of a disconnect between my brain and mouth, I keep wondering if its time to actually get a shrink?’ Jessie sat on the other side of the sofa and pulled her right leg on to her left using her hands, as they were giant slabs of meat at this stage, still shapely though, and laid back to stare at the ceiling.

‘Wouldn’t hurt’ Sara started browsing on her phone. ‘Any new Jessventures?’

‘So like I am at the dog park, I know we have no dogs just let me? So like I keep seeing this guy there yeah’ Jessie rolled her head to see Sara, with her eyes closed, pinching the bridge of her nose regretting something apparently, maybe the coffee.

‘I know you are small and cute, but there is an opposite to that called small and annoying, heard of a minion?’ She went back to her phone screen.

‘HEY! Minions are! Cute! So I see this guy playing a violin sometimes cause he needs money, I do too, and, and he’s got this cat coming to his shows!’ With that Jessie had gotten a bit of attention because Sara let the phone fall into her lap.

‘An outside one?’ She asked.

‘Feral I think they are called, he just sits there listening and the guy gives him a treat now cause this bugger a regular now’

‘Animals do like music, they make their own to find mates’ Sara took a sip of her coffee and saw Jessie staring intently into her eyes like she knew a secret that Jessie couldn’t wait to let out.

‘Huh ya, hmmm, I heard you used music to get Max, watchu play lover?’ Jessie grinned when the oh so serious Sara got some color in her cheeks from the surprise.

‘Such a long winded way to ask me that Jess’ She sighed.

‘So?’

‘I was a singer in a band for awhile, not anymore’

‘Can I-’

‘NO!’ and Sara went back to the phone, which signaled an end to that.

Jessie got up and went to prepare breakfast for the three of them, had a slight suspicion that Sara might have come over after eating but it was much more fun to make it and see her force it down. Max woke up an hour later and they had breakfast, and just like Jessie envisioned, Sara did not refuse the offer of breakfast to be polite because she had made it from scratch, and then she proceeded to slowly force it down her gullet and Max was a bit annoyed at that and complimented the food several times in case Jessie might get hurt from the drama next to her, which made this all so, so sweet.

When the both of them retreated to the room for some more coffee apparently, Jessie took stock of the grocery list and went out to the corner grocers and found Randy at the helm again, but his father was loitering around the racks restocking and took the list out of her hands just as soon as he saw it, he never talked lately to Jessie because Randy said that people sometimes mock his accent, the kind of people that Jessie would not call people, barbarians of the sort, and so this has made him much more insecure of his english, shame really, he was a fun old guy before. She went back to the counter and leaned on it to chat with Randy and saw a poster on the counter with a few numbers and hastily written details.

‘How is the hunt for the handsome fellow?’ Jessie asked noticing that.

‘Oh so many false claims, I was wondering why he insisted that I never give anyone his number, the amount of lies just coming won’t stop’ Randy was eating a cooked sausage of a paper plate, he bit into one before continuing. ‘Well but we had a good hit though, someone said that a person matching the description usually loitered around the lower end train tracks near the lake over yonder’

‘The I know’ Jessie had the name on the tip of her tongue, it was such an easy name.

‘Cat Lake?’ Randy said slowly, as if to not offend the fact that she had missed such an easy name, well that dog park was right here, so, that was yeah, Jessie thought.

‘Moving on, don’t tell me I got a description too’ She motioned for the pen, and wrote down.  
\-Homeless person  
\-Blind in one eye

\-Scalp skin missing showing bone above the right ear  
\-Balding with pock marked skin  
\-Hole under the lip where previously could have been a piercing  
\-She wrote down the area near the cemetery grounds, and noted the train tracks.

Randy took the poster and mulled it over, tugging slowly at his small wisp of a beard.

‘Yeah, this is it, with you that makes three, but of the three Miss Jessie you got so many details, do you want his number?’ Randy said absentmindedly watching his dad come over with a bag full of groceries. ‘Dad why? I’ll need to take it all out again to enter’

‘I know everything and price, let Miss Jessie go, its 214.2’ He walked off annoyed at his son.

‘Do you want to trust that old man and just pay that amount or can I enter everything again’

‘No need, I trust your dad Randy’ Jessie smiled when he handed over a business card, and the bag.

‘I don’t trust him, could miss a few and give people free stuff this way’ Randy said very seriously and she placed the bag back on the counter again. ‘I’m joking miss Jessie, have a nice day’

‘Oh okay, bye’ Jessie walked out thinking that didn’t actually sound like a joke, Randy was actually, seriously concerned that what he said was happening, must have happened actually, the way he acted.

\#

The weeks kept going forward and for Jessie the prospects of finding a new job was getting lower and lower, kitchen hands in pastry shops was a very niche job. Watching Bby get healthier and fatter was a nice change of pace that kept her head from going into the doom and gloom of thinking about life going into the gutter, lost love, lost job and Jessie couldn’t remember where her goals escaped to, life was blank when she looked straight ahead, it was surprising, more so because everything felt so normal, the days felt so mundane and natural and yet, the whiteness of the future had crept in and replaced all the colors that she should have looked forward to.

In her room she sat at her study table smoothing over Bby’s fur in spots where it stuck out and the curious cat just watched her hands, the strike back was supposed to happen ages ago but for some reason today, the cat tolerated her. After a few more minutes of petting, Bby told her enough by using her paws to push her hands away and went over to the window overlooking the bed and crawled under the curtain. Jessie picked up a pen and her journal, went to a blank page and listed down numbers starting from one to ten and tapped at the dot next to one, the idea was to list somethings she couldn’t bear losing, goals to aspire to, and after ten or so minutes Jessie just stared at the page eyes going in and out of focus, something had felt wrong for a while now, it was like a slow and steady seeping of life out from her fingertips, the mood swings, reacting to things a little too severely, the obvious carelessness of not enjoying anything lately without over analyzing which part of it she liked and finding the answer of none.

She went over to the window and peeked behind the curtain to find Bby with her paw on the glass staring intently outside, Jessie followed the gaze to see a hooded figure standing across the street staring right up at them. A chill struck her and traveled across the tips of her fingers to her chest and Jessie stood frozen, the figure below held up his arm and waved and Bby meowed. This was the first time she did and Jessie understood what was happening as the cat kept meowing and clawing at the glass, the person down there was the person Bby was with before.

‘Oh well just great, I can add petnapping to the list of crimes now’ Jessie let go of the curtain and walked out of her room to go meet the person below, at the door she paused and thought otherwise, not alone, never safe alone even with the pepper spray. Back in the living area of the apartment she plopped down onto a chair at the dining table and mused to herself. ‘He didn’t take care of you anyway Bby’

She sat at the table for hours just going through job listings on her phone, not one, not one listing that met her criteria that Jessie ended up going through receptionist listings, but those hires have a hidden deeper motives according to what she heard, good looking, sweet and timid would be the criteria, Jessie could act like that, but the good looking part was questionable. She went back into her room and stood in front of her mirror. Large bright brown eyes, full cheeks and shapely face, small nose, large brows and full lips, hair was fabulous as always but the skin tone and the slight Asian influence that came from her mothers side of the family over powered her dads European blood. Jessie compared herself to Max and made an imaginary rating, if Max was an eight on the scale she was at most a six.‘Stupid sexy Max’ Pouting she went into her wardrobe and found a dress that her mom made for her for a dance party where her whole extended family attended, it was a weird function because everyone knew everyone and she didn’t know anyone besides her own family, and still doesn’t, well now it was a fault of her own because everyone the same age shared numbers and held deep and long conversations and funny anecdotes, she tried making an effort at first but the attendees who came as plus ones and friends of family gave her too much attention that the pressure got to her so much that Jessie went back and hid behind her mother the rest of that day.

It was a floor length cream red gown with a layered skirt when worn was supposed to imitate an upside down flower in bloom, with an upper corset like bodice that accentuated her bosom, she put it on and found it a bit loose, how pudgy was she before to have something form fitting be loose now, well it made her feel great about her figure now, and if she looked unhealthy Max would be all like“Unacceptable!!!” and feed her till she exploded her current wardrobe.

She twirled around left and right and watched the dress flip around and hug her form, like as if she were dancing the movements to something like the Spanish tango, it felt good and the way the fabric moved across her body felt so beautiful, all the layers moving around in differing speeds across and over each other. Jessie grabbed the skirts on either sides and flipped it back and forth and had a great idea to get herself out of this current mood she had found herself in. The idea was a dance playlist and watch her moving herself in the mirror and see if she could still dance as well as she had done in her early twenties, when all the rage was going to clubs and just being in the scene. It went from normal choreographed movements to hopping, jumping twirling from side to side and moving any and which way she wanted without any inhibition over whether what she was doing when looked from across the way would make her feel embarrassed. Six or so songs later, visibly sweating and getting tired Jessie faced away from the mirror and found Sara leaning on the door frame a smile on her face just watching her making a fool of herself for who knows how long, still did not feel like one so Jessie found herself smiling back, beaming and happy.

‘Join me?’

‘Oh ho no, I don’t dance’ Sara replied.

‘but you were in the music scene? what?’

‘doing vocals and moving around in the moment are way different i think, dancing well is a whole other thing’

‘hmm i don't think so, its still music, and when you are the one creating the music it should feel more intimate don't you think, as you are one with and creating the rhythm, matching the tones with your own melodious voice letting everything flow out, baring your soul in song to plain strangers wanting to be accepted for how beautiful you are inside, much more scary than doing a little dance Sara’

‘you are dangerous, Max warned me’ There was bit of color in her cheeks and she was actively avoiding eye contact, first time Jessie had seen her acting shy.

‘Hoho i am? lets be besties and dance’

‘No, i have food’ She really wanted to move on and Jessie watched her disappear to the living room.

‘yeeee!’ She went after her.

\#

A week later Jessie woke up to find Max asleep next to her, which meant it was a weekend and if Max was still asleep there was further dire consequences to waking up before her, no breakfast. Jessie sat up and contemplated making it herself and watched Max’s sleeping face, watching the slow heaving of her chest and the relative calm of the room and the low early morning light seeping in through the window where the fabric of the curtains were thinner made the moment feel so serene she just wanted to crawl back in next to Max and cuddle back to sleep. The thought sequence surprised her again, the fact she wanted to feel babied, which like Sara told her, is not a great aspect of her personality, the need to feel cherished as she had been so, so much before by her mother, and the inevitable rebelliousness of herself running from home, blaming being suffocated with affection and rules and vowing to never go back, which her mother being a mirror of herself had banned her from ever coming back. Jessie regretted it, she knows her mother does too with how she acted later and those soulful sorrow in her eyes let out so many truths it was devastating for a while, and later, at this age, just wanting to go back into the bosom of someone and hiding herself inside, is a thought process that scared her so much, which was it, the loss of love or the fact that there was nothing she looked forward to made it feel so much scarier.

Jessie's eyes welled over, another mood swing, the world felt devastating sometimes, she stared down at her hands with the bunched up blanket and didn’t notice that Max had woken up and was observing what she was doing. It was a sudden fall when Max grabbed her arm and pulled her back into bed and hugged her face tight into her chest, giving the actual scene she had wanted to be in, she cried in silence for a while and they got up a bit later when Jessie felt calmer, and never talked about it again, she sat at the dining table, embarrassed but happy to have someone like Max, just like her mom had mentioned that one time.

The care given when the plate is brought over and softly, carefully placed on the table, the smile afterwards motioning for her to enjoy it as today she had taken care to be a bit more considerate and meticulous to the preparation of this breakfast. And all of this just pulled at a small thread of guilt growing up from the pit of her stomach weaving itself to a hefty rope that came straight up her throat and spilled out on to her chest, and if she cared to pull on this imaginary rope the words spilling out would be something that no one could actually deal with, as she didn’t understand how she could, so Jessie for this day decided to just repress this moody storm of feelings straight into the void, for now, as she had been doing for the years past.

Sprawled out on the couch watching Max sitting on the rug across her finishing up that classic teddy bear that she had been working on for the last few months, she was now doing just the last bits of intricacies and after she was going to go deliver it herself at the hospital.

‘Curious’ Jessie said at her smiling face, must be because she was finally getting it done.

‘Tell me darling’ Max replied very chipper.

‘Don’t be mad Moxy but, shouldn’t you finish things like that early cause the kid is sick?’

‘Moxy? Stop that and no I want it to be new, besides this is for someone in the recovery ward, if she relapsed they would let me know and honestly I don’t want to think that could happen’ Max sighed. ‘Don’t be such a morbid pessimist’

‘Sorry Max, where’s Sara?’ Jessie turned over on her back and watched the slowly revolving wooden ceiling fan, more a decoration than something that provides any sort of cooling.

‘On her way, asked her to bring lunch is why she is taking a while’ Max looked like she had finished up on the bear, she brought it over and placed it on Jessie’s chest. ‘Here! Let this bear heal your heart from whatever is happening lately darling’ She stood up and stared down at Jessie.

‘Thanks’ Jessie hugged the bear and watched Max satisfied with herself walk off to probably to take a shower, as is her routine.

After lunch Jessie was subject to a strange sort of entertainment, one of which that resembled those old silent shows in which there are a couple of hoodlums getting into repetitive trouble of sorts in which they clash mostly with each other. Sara was fidgeting and Max was next to her on the couch visibly frowning, they were watching something on the telly and Jessie was watching them, phone in her hand at the dinner table. The conflict rose from eyebrows, Sara’s eyebrows in which she had accidentally lopped off more than she intended to and had done a really bad salvage job to get them back into symmetry. And now she keeps rubbing, picking and tugging at her eyebrows absentmindedly which at first annoyed Max as she kept removing Sara’s hands from her face and holding them in hers at times to make her stop, but she never stopped and this was the first time Jessie noted that Sara really put a lot of work in to her appearance from the tip of her head to her shoes, everything was coordinated and perfect and now having one thing out of sync was causing her to be so, so self-conscious it was oozing out straight from her being and into the periphery of everyone watching, which made it worse because this was the exact thing she wanted to avoid from happening, people noticing.

‘I see all these perfect looking people everywhere these days’ Jessie piped up when the episode ended.

‘You should stop that, unhealthy love’ Max replied turning towards Jessie while stretching.

‘Funny, well i am going someplace like that too, anyways just look at them movie people, influencers and entertainment people, everyone is so dummy perfect looking creepy ain’t it’

‘Agree, when i see a fellow of the sort just walking around inside a crowd it looks so odd, like why, did he make a wrong turn in beautiful land to end up here’ Max pitched in.

‘Please Max stop i have only one train running in my head if it derails i forget, so then i was sitting on this bench at the dog park’

‘Are you stalking someone at the dog park?’ Sara broke her silence finally.

‘I was thinking i find guys attractive when they have a slight imperfection in how they look, that uniqueness is so appealing for some reason, its like finding a treasure and having to keep it’

‘Single!’ Sara pointed out flatly and laughed at her own joke.

‘STOP!’ Jessie felt her face go flushed with anger at that, the fact it was true was starting to hurt lately, not that any of them knew that she never had a relationship at all to this point, something she was planning to take straight to her grave.

‘What she is saying is stop doing that my love, its okay and you look okay honey’ Max took Sara’s face in her hands and squeezed.

‘I know, thanks Jess’

‘Welcome!’ She left for her room anyways, the day felt like it was ruined at this point, might as well go and see Bby and how her recovery was coming along.

Jessie opened the door to the cat again at the bedroom window overlooking the street, she had learned to move the curtains enough to provide her ample space to lay on the sill now, at the moment she was on attention eyes fixed on the street below.

‘Bby hear this, Sara was being mean to me again saying things like, I’m single and stuff’ at the sound of her voice Bby looked at her for a moment and thought her boring and went back again to the window and the captivating world below, apparently. ‘Well technically it is true yea’ Jessie walked over to the bed and sat down, the room was kind of clean still, Bby was doing her business in the provided expensive personal toilet, but once she is completely recovered the room would need a deep cleaning after her discharge forms are done with, would be sad but Max still can’t get over her fear of them.

‘If I had to explain it in a way that you can understand it Bby, I would say that its not actually the content of her words, it is the tone in which she delivers them, the bluntness and ruthless words of hers that hurt me so, so much’

‘Mow’ was the cat’s soft reply.

‘Oh heavens no, I can’t just throw her out like that’ Jessie observed the cat, her body language was that of someone who really wanted to be out of the confines she was in right now.

‘Mrow’

‘What!, those are words that should never come out of a proper ladies mouth, oh my, doing your business inside her purse is something you must never, even to teach her a lesson Bby’ She tried to pet the cat and had her hand swept off with a swipe, which annoyed Jessie, because Bby lets Max touch her.

‘Well, since you are doing so well now Bby, I will be letting you leave soon,but not until you let me pet you, just once for heavens sake’ Jessie stood up and felt her legs wobble a bit and she had to forcefully stomp forward to correct the lean she was falling into that would have made her face plant hard on the round rug in the middle of the room, as she stood shocked in place at the alien feeling of what had just happened, the internal panic levers and alarms started slamming and going off trying to tell her that this feeling was not normal, and this in turn made her whole body slowly go into a cold sweat increasing the panic. She was frozen in place a few more minutes afraid to take a step and went through all the things that this could mean, the biggest one was that it could be her current diet, this kind of head rush when suddenly standing up added up to people passing out when something is missing like not enough iron in the blood or having a diet that could lower blood pressure beyond normal, and it took awhile but after going through all the reasons and the fact of the matter that she did not actually fall and further coming to terms that it was just a slight wobbly fright, Jessie finally calmed herself down.

‘I need to go to the doctor too Bby’ She turned to look back and saw the cat now fixated completely on her. ‘I’m okay you don’t need to worry Bby, slight little itty bitty frighty’

The feeling remained on her mind the rest of the night, and it took a warm glass of milk and Max’s gentle sleepy murmurings of concern for someone who is usually out like a light, but it did help and Jessie dozed off while she was telling a story about the time her childhood pet bunny got sick because she wasn’t giving her enough affection, apparently they can die of sadness and loneliness, and during the last moments of her awake mind Jessie wondered if she could get sick the same way.

I have trouble pulling consistent shots when pulling multiples shots at once. The consistency is about pulling time for a certain grind size. I have a DF54 as grinder.

The first shot is always consistent. With the same grind size and bean, each first shot everyday is taking about the same time. 

But when I pull the second shot, right after the first one, the second shot takes MUCH more time, usually for a 1:2 ratio, 45-50 seconds for second shot against 28-35 seconds for the first shot. 

Routine :   
\- Turn on machine   
\- Wait green led while grinding 32g of coffee  
\- put 16g of the 32g coffee in the original rancilio 16g basket  
\- pull first shot with just tamping  
\- Clean evrything  
\- Let water drip to enable the boiler to heat again  
\- Once greens led returns pull second with remaining 16g shot with just tamping   


2nd shot ALWAYS takes an eternity to drip and ends up ruined. My workaround for now is to grind the seconds shot a bit coarser but I can not have any kind of consistency....

Between the trees... do you see it? Right in the center, maybe a little to the left. In that depth where you can't tell if it's an end or a beginning. Is there a thicket deep inside? It beckons me. It pulls me in: to enter, to dive into this unconsciousness like Alice. To fall asleep and see what happens next. Imagining another reality. Who is there? What is there? Why is it silent, yet calling out to me?

Sitting in an armchair, cup of coffee in hand, I unconsciously ignore everything around me. Group therapy. People are sharing their personal stories, but I can't reach them. Something forces me to stare at one spot for hours, imagining a world that doesn't exist. And I know for a fact it doesn't exist. I know that behind those trees lies a simple road and the cottages of the people who live here.

I came here to heal my soul. But I found healing not in talking to people, but in searching for the source of this strange vision. A fairy-tale thicket. The unknown. An infinity that is impossible to fathom, but which exists. And I see it.",1,1768139179.0,MaladaptiveDreaming,0,1.0,False

In the news:

The new Mt Fortune theme, Lunar New Year started this week. My full analysis of the current patterns and my suggested strategy can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wordscapes/s/RE2VacJ9ep). It’s not clear how long we will have it for, but a more patient approach than mine using similar rules should see the portrait set completed for less than I did. Depending how much time you get, some paid runs may be required. 

There was some testimony that the newer ghost glitch was resolved, at least for some. This glitch was where a person left a team but still appeared on the list for some members. It certainly happened on my team. Two ghost players, one of whom I could see, were removed from the list. It’s not clear whether this was a global fix, or just Support actioning open tickets related to the issue. If you’ve noticed that it’s fixed, or not, please comment and let us know whether Support had been contacted about it. If your team is still affected by it, there was a [workaround/fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/wordscapes/s/N4ITPFTvKN) posted this week. 

There was a [new loading screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wordscapes/s/UtfZZoPpIc ) with a cup of maybe coffee, but as someone pointed out, more likely hot chocolate.

1q9zp0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1q9zp0d/feeling_stuck_at_low_paying_job_with_picky_hirers/,Feeling stuck at low paying job with picky hirers,"Hey Reddit. I'm not entirely sure if the tag actually fits what I'm going to be talking about but that's the most I got. Apologies for the essay in advanced.

I'm 18 currently working below my state's minimum wage making drinks and cooking food. Mind you I am the lowest paid at my job. You'd think ""it's probably a starting rate"" or ""it's more than likely because you get tips!"" but no, the girl I was working with before who quit started at 16 an hour. And the digital tips are split across everyone including both owners. Even working alone with my boss behind the counter, those tips are split and go to the company. Now a lot of my past coworkers within the 7 months I've been working there have left to go either to school or because they didn't like how chaotic the coffee shop got. Which the school part, sure I get it. But for them all to go ahead to switch from those lives to go work at Starbucks at one of Jersey's largest malls didn't make any sense. It's honestly laughable.

To stay on topic, I worked with a girl who clearly had some sort of medical condition that stopped her from working at a certain pace. And we all have our issues and bumps in the roads. There's nothing wrong with that. And no I am not obligated to know what's wrong with any of my coworkers as it's none of my business. But did it impact my work flow? Oh for sure. Not only that I was assigned, unknown to me to train her. I don't get paid enough to train anyone. I was patient at first. I noticed it almost immediately that she shook a lot. Again none of my business but it clearly affected her ability to keep up with making drinks. We get random rushes. I cannot cook while single beverages are taking close to 5 minutes to get checked off. So we switched. But I enjoy cooking. Overtime of speaking up about her inability to do certain task, running around the bar in an empty cafe around me and no sense of environmental awareness to my leaders, being ignored and told to fix it myself eventually aggravated me to the point of going non verbal with her. When I'm upset, I shut down. I hate confrontation so yes, speaking up amongst the people I work with i need to work on. There was an incident regarding oatmeal. I was in a rush to keep up with Uber always sending drivers the moment the orders come in, noticed what she couldn't and I dumped what she was making since there was absolutely no way in hell were we giving a customer who paid $8 for oatmeal 1/4 of the portion they paid for. The girl I worked with had a terrible habit of rolling her eyes. I was already overstimulated that I had to contact the person who ordered the oatmeal and call uber to ensure they got their refund problem free. Customer service is important to me. I know I should've spoken up before dumping what she was making. I totally understand why that bothered her. Apparently when she confronted me about it and how I responded ""startled her"" or was ""aggressive"". But when I told her what she did wrong she rolled her eyes. So of course I took a walk.  But I guess over the weekend she decided she couldn't put up with me anymore and quit. And since around November, we've been searching for someone to work with us. No one qualifies, no one fits the vibe. And it's starting to aggravate me even more. I want to move out soon and at the rate I'm getting paid I'm not moving out until the end of the year.

The reason i won't speak up about my pay, won't leave my job and find another is because I feel it's my fault that girl decided to leave. Not that it matters but I'm the youngest employee. Even from the rest of my past employees I've been the youngest. The girl who quit had just turned 23. With them struggling terribly to find qualified applicants to join the crew I feel even worse. I work extra unpaid hours, I help out as much as possible and sometimes sit behind the bar alone to get things done while my leaders have to do other things. Which is fine! Really! But I work my damn ass off. I bring customers back with my creative flavors, I'm energetic and patient with the customers I get. I work quick, I work efficiently. I do some kick ass work! I'm always getting compliments from customers I refuse to take because I'm really just doing my job.  But I'm starting to get angry. I'm having trouble waking up 5:30 in the morning to catch the bus and open. I'm starting to feel more upset when I go home and less accomplished. And I don't know what to do. I know I need to speak up about how low I've been getting paid but I'm scared out of my mind it's going to ruin the relationship I built with my leaders and I'm kind of just stuck.",2,1768139099.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

I've had reoccurring BV for the past 8 years; this is the first year that Metro gel has absolutely done nothing for it. So my doctor started me on estradiol cream .01. I started last week so I'm still in the loading phase. I've actually lessened it to less than a pea size amount and only using in the morning but I've had the WORST insomnia of my entire life. I know it's the estradiol because nothing else has changed about my routine, and for someone in peri, I was actually sleeping really good before 😭 
The estradiol has actually helped with the bv odor; for the first time in almost a year I've gone a whole day without having any weird smells. I feel less urgency to pee. So it is helpful in that aspect. But last night I literally laid awake all night feeling that weird in and out sleep! I'm going to contact my doctor in the morning but even sitting here this morning (I used it yesterday but not today yet) I literally feel like I've had a whole pot of coffee! I hate that this is the trade off. Has this happened to anyone else or anyone know how to combat this? I'm sure my doc has some answers but I would love to be able to sleep tonight!

I am early on the journey but have many of the classic symptoms, tho mild and early in the progression of the disease, basically just the SI joint on one side so far. 

Do you all have any recommendations for what to speak with my Rheum about during my follow up diagnostic appointment?  

Current symptoms: 
I go to bed feeling normal 0-1 out of 10 pain. 
Then, inflammatory back pain cranks up at night in the SI joint / glute. I get about 3 hrs of sleep before the pain wakes me up and then am in the constant wake up cycle every 30min or so until finally just getting out of bed around 4 am because I can’t get comfortable and fall back asleep. 

I’m usually up and down to floor doing cat dog / stretching for 20-30 min while I drink my coffee and then force myself out the door for a walk. 

After walking 1.5 miles (the first 1/4 of which is very uncomfortable) my pain level drops to almost 0 and I’m able to do core exercises and get a deeper stretch. 

My pain usually remains at almost 0 for the rest of the day, as long as I stay active and don’t sit static for more than an 45 mins or so.

Hi, I’m **Vi**, 18M, and I’m looking for **genuine, long-term friendships**. Not timepass. If you’re bored for a week and then gone, this isn’t for you.

I’ve finished school. Not really into the whole college path right now. I work in my dad’s company, but I want to build something of my own. I’m planning to start a YouTube channel this year, and yeah, I’m serious about it.

Things I’m into:

* **Art & animation** (this is my big thing)
* **Cars & bikes** anything with an engine. I fix my own stuff and I’m a full-on mechanic nerd
* **Airsoft, milsim, military history** (sadly not popular where I live, but I’m deep into it)
* **Warhammer & DnD** (never played DnD yet, but I really want to maybe we change that)
* **Cooking** coffee, mocktails, cocktails, experimenting like a mad scientist in the kitchen (my mom is not a fan)
* **Animals > humans**, always. I’ve got a dog and I’m currently taking care of a pigeon family
* **Basketball** used to play every evening with a friend, now it’s mostly just me
* **Gym** not obsessed, but I like how I look, so I stick with it

I’m always down to learn new things too, so even if your interests are totally different, I’m open as long as you actually care about them.

# A bit of backstory (because context matters)

Most of my life, I was the “top kid.” Good at studies, sports, social stuff. Teachers liked me. People came to me for help. I had friends, relationships, the whole thing.

But I was always maintaining an image always trying to be “cool.” Hanging out with popular kids, doing what looked right instead of what felt right. There were things I genuinely loved (like art) that I ignored because they didn’t fit the image.

I’m done with that.

I know I’m a nerd. I *want* to be a nerd.  
And I don’t want 50 surface-level friends who don’t care about what I love. I want **2–3 people** who actually get me and give a damn.

If you’re someone who’s passionate, building something, or at least knows the direction you want to go but feels lonely while doing it yeah, that’s why I’m here.

Be my friend, and I’ll be there for you. Not for a week. Not for a month. Not even for a year.

# A few important things:

1. Don’t start with just “hi.” Tell me about yourself. What are you into? Why are you here?
2. I prefer calls over endless texting but we can ease into it. Ask questions if you’re unsure.
3. I won’t always text first. I want mutual effort. Random 3am “wyd?” texts are welcome.
4. You can ask me anything what I look like, whatever. Just ask.
5. **Strictly SFW.** Even a hint of NSFW and I’m gone.
6. Any age and gender works with me so don't shy out.

I stumbled across this piece on quantum computing and AI integration, and it hit me how profound and unsettling this moment is. We're not in a hypothetical debate anymore. We're in the *deployment phase*.

Think about it: quantum computers solving drug discovery problems in days instead of months. AI systems that adapt in real-time to city traffic flows. Hybrid architectures where quantum processors handle optimization tasks that would take classical computers years to work through. These aren't lab curiosities—companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google are productizing them right now. SAP has already demonstrated quantum-enhanced business optimization in proof of concepts.

What fascinates me most is the *everydayness* of it all. We've crossed a threshold where technologies that belonged to the realm of speculation five years ago are now just... business problems. Strategic decisions. ""What's our quantum roadmap?"" is becoming as practical a question as ""What's our cloud strategy?"" was fifteen years ago.

The article touches on some profound implications: enterprise systems solving supply chain optimization 98-99% efficiently versus 85-90%. Drug discovery accelerated by 40%. Energy consumption in data centers reduced by 12.5% through quantum-classical hybrid systems. These aren't marginal improvements. These are transformative leaps.

And yet—and I think this is the part that keeps me up at night—we're moving *fast*. Too fast, maybe, to fully grapple with what we're building. Humanoid robots working autonomously. AI systems learning your emotional state. Genetic editing becoming more accessible. Brain-computer interfaces moving from medical devices to consumer enhancement. The technologies that sci-fi warned us about and inspired us with are arriving in a compressed timeline.

The fiction prepared our imaginations. It didn't prepare our institutions, our ethics, our labor markets, or our societies.

I don't know if this is the year things fundamentally shift—though some futurists are predicting 2026 might be exactly that. But I do know that the gap between what I read in speculative fiction as a kid and what I'm implementing professionally *today* has become vanishingly small.

So I'm sharing this article because it's a snapshot of that moment. Quantum computing and AI aren't coming. They're here. The question now is: what do we do with them?",1,1768138681.0,quantum,0,1.0,False

# Now, about me.

Hi, I’m **Vi**, 18M, and I’m looking for **genuine, long-term friendships**. Not timepass. If you’re bored for a week and then gone, this isn’t for you.

I’ve finished school. Not really into the whole college path right now. I work in my dad’s company, but I want to build something of my own. I’m planning to start a YouTube channel this year, and yeah, I’m serious about it.

Things I’m into:

* **Art & animation** (this is my big thing)
* **Cars & bikes** anything with an engine. I fix my own stuff and I’m a full-on mechanic nerd
* **Airsoft, milsim, military history** (sadly not popular where I live, but I’m deep into it)
* **Warhammer & DnD** (never played DnD yet, but I really want to maybe we change that)
* **Cooking** coffee, mocktails, cocktails, experimenting like a mad scientist in the kitchen (my mom is not a fan)
* **Animals > humans**, always. I’ve got a dog and I’m currently taking care of a pigeon family
* **Basketball** used to play every evening with a friend, now it’s mostly just me
* **Gym** not obsessed, but I like how I look, so I stick with it

I’m always down to learn new things too, so even if your interests are totally different, I’m open as long as you actually care about them.

# A bit of backstory (because context matters)

Most of my life, I was the “top kid.” Good at studies, sports, social stuff. Teachers liked me. People came to me for help. I had friends, relationships, the whole thing.

But I was always maintaining an image always trying to be “cool.” Hanging out with popular kids, doing what looked right instead of what felt right. There were things I genuinely loved (like art) that I ignored because they didn’t fit the image.

I’m done with that.

I know I’m a nerd. I *want* to be a nerd.  
And I don’t want 50 surface-level friends who don’t care about what I love. I want **2–3 people** who actually get me and give a damn.

If you’re someone who’s passionate, building something, or at least knows the direction you want to go but feels lonely while doing it yeah, that’s why I’m here.

1q9zi9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1q9zi9d/tifu_by_setting_boudaries_for_my_birthday/,TIFU by setting boudaries for my birthday,"Throwaway account because I don't want any of the involved parties to find my main account. English is not my first language and I am using my phone at 3am to type this out, so I sincerely apologise for any mistakes in grammar or formatting. 

I don’t wanna create “drama” at work, but at the same time I no longer care and need to tell someone about it. The people in my life heard me complain too much already, so it’s time for the strangers on the internet to listen to my rambling.

This all happened a few days ago and to start somewhere, I (30F) had a group of work friends that I was starting to feel left out of more recently. This group mainly included Amy (33F), Brad (31M), Chris (29M) and Donna (27F). There are a few more people that were more casually involved with the group, but they are not really relevant to the story. 

To preface this and give some clarity into who is who, Chris, Donna and I started working together and quickly became friends. We would do the usual, chat at work, on our breaks, go for dinner together after work, see each other maybe once every 2 months outside of work for coffee or lunch, and just click well overall. There was never anything romantic and that isn't the point of the whole situation at all. 

After a while of us hanging out, we had a company event where different departments worked together on a kind of team building project. I won’t get into too much detail, but we met Amy, Brad and a few other people from other departments and decided our group had a fun time together. We regularly started to hang out, went out for food/coffee, celebrated each other's birthdays, and even had a BBQ picnic type of outing. The group would always be about 4 to 6 people, and we would do those outings maybe once or twice a month. 

Now when I met the others at the event, I really liked Amy and another girl (who has since switched jobs) and I wanted to be good friends with the 2 of them. For some reason I became better friends with Brad though, and we would talk more often. I still tried talking as much with Amy, but in her words she was ""really busy so she can’t reply as much"" thus she would either leave me on “read” or not reply for 5 business days or more.

The thing that messed it all up was my birthday a few days ago.

I wanted to celebrate it by doing some things I wanted to do, which included seeing a local small festival (food stalls, shopping, pretty decorations, all that jazz) and then having dinner at a restaurant I really liked. This was also really close to my house, and I wanted to NOT travel back home late at night, as our usual hang outs were always around the other side of town (about a 30min commute for me).

When we would usually meet up, we would always do something Amy or Donna wanted to do. I honestly didn’t mind anything as long as we could hang out, but this time I made a whole plan specifically for my birthday.

It all started going downhill when the restaurant was not available for the day I planned.
As it was also about a month before my birthday I did the most logical thing to me at the time and asked them all to move the day we were meeting to the next day instead (our work schedules for this month weren’t out yet, but think like from 10th to the 11th).
 
Amy and Donna said how everyone already asked for the time off and they can’t change it, but the others said they were fine with anything because at the end of the day it’s for my birthday. To not cause any issues, I simply decided to change the restaurant, but was still sad because I really wanted to go to the original one.

Nonetheless, other plans were still good to go, we all agreed to meet early to see everything, take lots of pics, have coffee and then go have dinner.

About 10 days before the day, I message everyone the updated plan just to make sure everyone can make it at the agreed time and to see if I included everything I wanted to do and see. Everyone said it looked great and they couldn’t wait.

Mind you, we do not have a group chat together, they said they don’t like group chats and that they can’t keep messaging constantly anyway, so I messaged each person individually about this.
(I have no idea how I was so blind about their lies, as I later saw Chris and Donna were a part of the same group chat, and the number of participants was accidentally the same as our group, but without me (hopefully that makes sense, it did in my head).)

Five days before the day we were supposed to meet, I get a message from Amy telling me that they “forgot” to tell me they were gonna meet earlier that day to help Donna buy glasses and to see a shop that recently opened, so could we actually do that instead of seeing the festival? Also they were all under the impression that we were only gonna meet for dinner and not do anything else? 

How??? I have no idea, none of them can obviously read.

I told her that it was weird no one ever mentioned it considering we work in the same office space, or through messages when I asked about the meeting time, but sure they can go do that and we can just meet up for dinner.

She then said they were actually gonna do that in the MORNING of the day, and then meet up with me, and if I’m not gonna join them then they weren’t going either?? Which makes no sense but OKAY.

In the meantime (and because Amy took forever to reply) I messaged Donna who I felt I was a bit closer to, and told her I didn’t think it was cool to not inform me if they were gonna change the plan on their own, and that she should have told me while we were discussing it previously, she had plenty of time to do so.

I knew she wanted to get new glasses because she told me this about a week earlier.

I also mentioned that I would be okay with changing any OTHER plan if it was any other day, but this was my BIRTHDAY. I would not be changing it, and I will go to the festival alone if I have to, they can just come join me at a later time.
It was fine to change the plan but I wish they said something if they couldn’t make it to the meeting time.

Her reply was that she asked Amy to go with her to get the glasses and some other things, and that Amy asked her if we could change the festival plan to that instead, and only then to ask me to go with them.

My reply was that I didn’t really wanna do all that for my birthday? They both could finish their shopping and then just join the rest for dinner, I wouldn’t mind, I just wanted them to tell me this EARLIER and not 5 days before the day we were gonna meet. 

Her response was that it wasn’t even final yet and that she would “check with the others” and let me know??

The way I understood it was that Amy, Brad and Chris thought we would only meet for dinner, which doesn’t make sense because I told them the specific meeting time, so how does any of this make any sense? It doesn’t but oh well.

Following this she said that she “can’t know what me and Amy talk about”, that maybe they didn’t know when we were supposed to meet? and she thought that maybe me and Amy talked about it already and that we were gonna change it.

My reply was that it’s obviously hard to keep track of all of them due to not having a proper group chat, but if they wanted to do something else they had every opportunity to send a message at any time and recommend, or even say they can’t make it or that they wanna do something else before meeting.

While I understand they did let me know the same thing the day before, it still hurt me that they had such a long time to tell me or send me a text about it, but no one did.
They all “forgot” that they made the plan to do it before meeting with me.

This also cemented the fact to me that they don’t really take my feelings into consideration, because at the end of the day they wanted to do something THEY want, and couldn’t even think to include to ask me.

This isn't just about them hanging out without me, they're free to do so obviously. It's about rhe fact they knew what I want to do and they changed it between themselves and didn't tell me.

After all of these messages, Amy and Donna didn’t really interact with me at work or in private. While they did reply when spoken to, they never initiated anything.

On the day we were going to meet, I got a message from Amy asking me where I was, and I replied I was in the vicinity but as we didn’t have a specific location where we would meet up, I asked where she was. She never replied to my message and as I got closer I saw them in the distance, all 4 of them, standing there and chatting.

I can see very far, so I stood a good way away and just looked at them.

I messaged each of them again that I was close and asked where they were.
No one replied for about 20 minutes.

I stood there, looking at them, having this surreal feeling of watching strangers having fun.

They all checked their phones a few times, but continued standing there for another 20 minutes.

After a total of 40 minutes, Donna replied saying that Amy will tell me where they are, and Amy took another 5 minutes to reply asking if there was a bathroom in the area.

A total of 45 minutes.
It took them 45 minutes to reply to my message, and I just stood there, like an idiot waiting for them to reply, and they didn’t even notice I was there.

I went to where they were, acted like nothing was wrong, like it was another regular day.

We did what I wanted, we saw the festival, we ate a lot of food, we drank a lot of alcohol.

They acted like nothing was amiss, and I did too.

I thanked them all over texts and asked for photos/videos they took, they sent them through.
Since that day Amy and Donna haven’t messaged me or talked to me.

Chris and Brad kinda talk to me, if that can even be countedas talking.

At work they act like they do to everyone else, but we don’t chat about random things anymore. Donna doesn’t even look in my direction unless she has to.

I guess some people just look like adults, but inside they’re still middle schoolers who get upset if they don’t get what they want.

I’m honestly feeling so disappointed in them, but at the same time I’m aware I shouldn’t give too much meaning to “work friendships”.

There are a lot of other things i noticed in the last year we were “friends” but here are a few examples:

-They would hide their trips and outings from me, 
Amy ignored my messages asking when she was free to hang out, everytime giving the excuse she “doesn’t know her schedule”, “is very busy at work”, “has to visit family that she never visits” etc
- I would talk to Brad about his plans for the holidays, he would say he’s gonna hang out with Amy and Donna, and then both of them (A/D) would lie about what they did that day, or who they were with
- I got 2 tickets to a show, and asked each of them to go with me because I didn’t wanna go alone, they all promised they would make sure at least 1 person takes a day off to go with me, but 2 weeks before the show they said they were all busy with work and can’t make it - by accident I found out they all had the exact same day off and just didn’t want to go (which they could have said directly, why hide it??)
- We talked about a company event and how we would hang out together, and when the day came they all went their own way leaving me to mingle with other coworkers

These examples might seem meaningless with no more context, or even silly but they keep popping up in my head.

Also don’t get me started on the birthday present they got me.
I don’t need fabulous or expensive gifts, even just showing up would have been enough for me that day.
In this case I told them what I want in advance, because I don’t really like surprises, so they got a general idea, and they can choose to split it up or whatever.
None of the things I mentioned were expensive either, I am aware people have bills or debts to pay, so it was like 5~10$ range per person.

I got the bad supermarket chocolate (the less than 1$ kind), expired scented oils/insence (I have no idea what it was), some 1$ store accessories (which I don’t even use and have never used, so not sure where that came from), a water bottle and random character badges (I don’t wear badges nor do I have any bags I can clip them on, they never saw me with one). 

The birthday card was a post card they got when getting me the water bottle (I recognized it because I also got one when I went to the same store a week before).

They couldn’t even buy me a fucking birthday card, they used a random post card they got FOR FREE.

Now, like I said, people have bills, I get that, but what did they get each other for their birthdays? 
New top of the line external battery or memory with a bunch of accessories (I think it was around 80$ I can’t remember which one it was), a brand wrist watch, a branded wallet, expensive Belgian chocolates, etc.

What did I ask for?
A book from the series I love (the most expensive edition is about 15$), a charm similar to labubu (not a labubu - was maybe 10$ the most), tasty supermarket chocolate (the one that's like 3$).

Again, it’s not about the money, it’s about the principle and consideration.

Now I have to go to work and have 2 of them not even look at me or talk to me unless completely necessary.

I just ask this because I see a lot of “how do I meet women?” posts, and they always confuse me. Because women are everywhere, they are at your school, they are at your job, they are at the grocery store, coffee shops, etc. they are anywhere in public. 

You’re surrounded by women, and in most cases I’d say, the women around you are a lot like you, as you guys are occupying the same space. (Not saying you’re the same, or that you’ll hit it off but if you’re in the same spaces you most likely probably share a lot of the social and economical circumstances).

**TL;DR:** PAR Technology is a vertical software transition story hitting its inflection point. They just posted their first profitable Adjusted EBITDA quarters in 2025. [Voss Capital ](https://olympus-trade.com/dashboard/voss-capital-llc)has recently increased their stake above 10% (they are now one of the largest shareholders), and word on the street is that there is a potential ""Whale"" contract (speculated to be McDonald's) that could double their ARR. 

# 1. The Business: ""Unified Commerce"" for Enterprise

For those unfamiliar, PAR has spent the last few years transforming from a ""boring hardware conglomerate"" into a **pure-play enterprise restaurant software platform**. The thesis relies on them finally proving they can stop burning cash and start scaling margins.

Rather than mom-and-pop coffee shops (that's Toast's lane), PAR hunts **Enterprise Chains** (50+ units). Think Burger King, Hooters, and potentially larger targets.  
Their stack is sticky because it integrates everything:

* **Brink POS:** Cloud Point-of-Sale (23k+ locations).
* **Punchh:** Loyalty (60k+ locations) 
* **Stuzo & TASK:** Recent acquisitions adding C-Store (Chevron/Circle K) and International markets.​

**The Moat:** Churn is incredibly low (\~4%) because ripping out an enterprise POS system across 2,000 stores is a logistical nightmare. Once PAR is in, they stay.​

# 2. The ""Whale"" Speculation (McDonald's?)

* **Signal:** PAR management explicitly deferred \~$5M of high-margin recurring revenue in 2025 to focus engineering resources on a massive ""Tier 1 RFP"".​
* **The Speculation:** [Greenhaven Road ](https://olympus-trade.com/dashboard/greenhaven-road-capital)suggests this is **McDonald's**. McDonald's currently uses an aging proprietary POS (developed from a Brazilian acquisition years ago) and is facing technical debt. They already use PAR's **TASK** software for loyalty in Asia.​
* **The Prize:** A McDonald's win would be $100M+ in ARR - effectively doubling the software business overnight. Even if they don't win, being a finalist validates the tech stack.​

# 3. Financial Metrics

The ""value"" argument here is that the cash burn phase is ending.

* **Margins:** Subscription gross margins are hitting 69-73% with a path to 75%+.​
* **Profitability:** They hit adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2025. The Stuzo acquisition is running at \~42% EBITDA margins (Rule of 40), which is accretive immediately.​
* **Burger King:** The BK rollout paused briefly in early 2025, but only because BK decided to *expand* the scope to include PAR's back-office module, increasing the contract value by \~25%.​
* **Current State:** PAR trades at \~4x EV/Revenue and <8x ARR.
* **The Comparables:** High-quality vertical software peers with similar profiles (20%+ growth, sticky retention) trade at significantly higher premiums:
   * **Agilysys (AGYS):** Trades at \~8x Sales and \~34-45x EBITDA.​
   * **AppFolio (APPF) & Manhattan Associates (MANH):** Often trade at 8x+ Sales.

# Risks 

* **Dilution History:** Shareholders have been diluted \~42% over the last 3 years to fund acquisitions and growth. The share count jumped from 27.3M to 38.7M.​
* **ROIC:** Return on Invested Capital was -7.25% in FY2024 against a WACC of \~11%. They have historically destroyed value to build the platform. The bull case assumes this metric flips positive as capex remains low (software maintenance mode) while revenue scales - i.e. this business doesn't look that cheap from a simple P/E screener / multiple perspective.

I’m a very sensitive person, and I’ve recently realized how much my nervous system gets overwhelmed in daily life.

I tend to be sensitive to:

	•	people’s tone, words, and behavior

	•	loud noises, crowded places, and sudden movements

	•	overthinking and fear that doesn’t always have a clear cause

	•	caffeine, especially coffee, which significantly increases my anxiety

I’m trying to understand how to regulate my nervous system in a sustainable way, not just calm myself in the moment.

I’d really appreciate hearing from your personal experience:

	•	What exactly helped you regulate your nervous system (step by step if possible)

	•	How often you practiced it

	•	How long it took to notice changes

	•	What symptoms it helped with (overstimulation, anxiety, overthinking, fear, emotional overwhelm, etc.)

Also, if you struggled with consistency or sticking to routines, I’d love to know:

	•	What made routines hard for you

	•	How you adapted or simplified them

	•	What helped you stay consistent without pushing yourself too hard

I also recently changed my diet. No processed food, fast foods, acidic foods, sodas, coffee, alcohol.

2 years ago I was diagnosed with stomach inflammation and bile reflux which my doctor said is not that much in my stomach so it’s not a big deal. This was when I hand endoscopy and turned out I had an ulcer. 

So now after being diagnosed with acid reflux by an ENT doctor, I eat more plain, real food. Recently I noticed my poop was yellowish (this might be due to ppi, had this happen 2 years ago as well), but now my poop is greenish. It’s not fully green tho. 
Can this be caused by diet? I eat more salad (couple leafs every day or like every other day), like half an avocado, some blueberries as well. I also eat more diary products, natural yogurt with chia seeds, more fruits in general too. I also notice that I have like a light head. Not that I’m gonna pass out tho. I think this also might be due to PPI dosage and me producing more acid now. I had this happen last time, 2 years ago, as well. Sometimes after a dinner I get REALLY sleepy. I recently did a blood work. Blood, pancreas and liver are good. Also glucose levels are 98 (this is higher, but still normal according to the lab. 100 is where diabetes might happen). 

I used to poop every day while drinking 2 coffees a day and it was brown. Like 3-4 years ago it changed and I started pooping every 2, 3 or sometimes even 4 days. Now that I’ve cleaned my diet, I poop every day (today is day 6 of pooping every day) again and that’s without coffee. Is this a good or a bad sign?

Mainly extra bathroom breaks and flexibility for doctors appointments. Totally fair and I had no issue with that at all.

But in reality shes spending like two to three hours of every shift in the bathroom. Which means shes not getting her work done. And when she misses deadlines guess who gets it dumped on them. Me.

My manager keeps assigning me her overdue stuff on top of my own workload. Im told to drop everything because its already past due. So now I have to scramble to do her job and still somehow get mine done. Ive brought it up but my boss is scared of a lawsuit and wont hold her accountable. He just tells her dont let it happen again and then it happens again. Every time.

 She constantly eats stuff she knows is going to mess her up. Fast food. Donuts. Sugary coffee drinks. And she jokes about it too like haha I shouldnt be eating this but oh well. Then an hour later shes either in the bathroom for 45 minutes or going home early because she doesnt feel well.

I also have a chronic illness that flares up based on what I eat. Ive had to give up a ton of foods I love. And yeah sometimes I slip up on the weekend but I would never do it at work because I know itll wreck me. And if I do have a rough day because of something I ate over the weekend I still show up and push through because thats on me.


I felt bad for her at first because I know how hard it is to work with a chronic condition. But watching her sabotage herself constantly and then make it everyones problem is exhausting. I shouldnt have to do overtime every week because she cant stop eating stuff she knows will set her off.

1q9z8s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatholicWomen/comments/1q9z8s7/idk_how_to_feel_opposite_sex_friends/,Idk how to feel -opposite sex friends,"So my boyfriend has these two friends who are females. He’s known them for years from church and never dated either of them or anything. They’re not intimidating to me. But he has this book club with just them two every few weeks and they usually go to lunch or a coffee shop and meet up after Mass on a Sunday. I’m not invited because it’s an “exclusive” book club. When we first started dating, he asked them if I could join and get they actually said no because they want to keep it small. And people in the past have joined and quit or whatever. So I’m punished because other people can’t keep a commitment. He sort of asked if I was okay with it back when we first started dating and I didn’t want him to lose friends because of me or be controlling so I said I didn’t have an issue. Well now that a few months have passed, I don’t really like that they purposely exclude me. It gives me anxiety. Even though I’m not intimidated by them nor do I think he’s so untrustworthy that he’d flirt with them or something. I just don’t like it, and I know if we get married I’m not going to be okay with it if they continue to not allow me to join. Idk how to bring it up or what to say. Thoughts? Am I just being crazy?

He has not let me and it is been a year and a half. I was shocked at his behavior when I tried to end things early on (stalking, threats, constant messages and just not giving up) and ended up staying to calm things down. I've basically resort to fawning as it has kept me safe in the past. He is an ex addict and drug dealer and was just out of jail. I didn't know all this when we went out. I'm highly educated and I have never even gotten drunk. He says he loves me and I have stated clearly to him that I don't love him back. When I try to leave I have to be ready to navigate a storm, I've tried many times with no success; when I keep my head down and conform to his will to make this relationship work, he is a loving boyfriend and he has improved himself greatly: less jelous, really supportive, caring with my dogs (which are my only family), has stopped smoking because I asked him to, and - big one - has respected my will to not have sex. This is a big change on his side, as I've told him early on, I'm on the asexuality spectrum and he then just took offence, said I was gay and/or just had another 10 guys on the side. In the early stages of the relationship he wanted sex and made a fuss if the designated day would be postponed to the day after. At one point I just told him: ""I'm asexual, I've told you from day one, now you can go crazy all you want with your behavior, but I'm not having sex with you anymore cause I can't and my body can't."" As I said, he took this surprisingly well. I suppose he grew up with some really messed up parents and just hadn't better models for his behaviors: every time I told him his behaviors were wrong/aggressive/controling he has tried to change that. But I'm still not in love with him, still worried for his financial situation (I help him out a lot) and still somewhat scared of him. Last summer I had a septoplasty and got accused 2 hours after waking up after general anesthesia of flirting with the son of my hospital roommate in front of him. I was litteraly lying down with tampons in my nostrils not being able to breath. And this was after he improved himself greatly. With this I mean that he is still a wild card. 
Now to the friend. I met her at the gym and we started seeing each other sometimes for coffees, then began hiking together. She is a nurse and work shifts, so I understand she is busy/tired and never made a fuss about her frequent canceling on me. 
She has stated that she was very happy of our budding friendship and wished our it would grow. At one point  finally told her I was in a toxic relationship. I didn't want her to judge me by my baggage or to have to carry it, so I just said I will tell her more when I'm ready and to not worry. After the septoplasty incident, when it was clear to me that even if I comply with my boyfriend's will I will be subject to outburst episodes, and after one more woman killed by her ex husband in the news, I asked her to talk about it stating I didn't know if I had an exaggerated fear of my boyfriend or not. I told her I wanted to see things from the neutral prospective of a kind trusted friend. I also told her that I have not talked about this situation to anyone as I'm deeply ashamed of being in it.
She told me yes and that she was worried but has now kept on canceling on our meet ups for months and we have not met (outside her bday, where many people were invited) or talked about the subject. Now I no longer have the urge to end this relationship (I have health problems that are now a priority and can't deal with the eventual storm) nor the will to open up about it with her.
I feel that most of her excuses for cancelling were somehow valid and was undestanding at first, but I also feel that in her shoes I would have found the time to hear out a friend in these four months, at least to make sure she was not in danger and what her situation was. 
In the end I accepted I was not her priority or top friend and have lowered her ranking among my priorities. 
Now she leaves for a six months period as a nurse in a war zone (noble, I know) and wants us to meet before she leaves. She also added that she would have very little time for this meeting.
I now finally feel really upset at her: having to go grab a coffee with her because she goes in a war zone, acting like we are all good because who would want to upset someone going in a war zone... I was for a slow fade of our friendship, now I have to wear a ""feel good mask"". Luckily it will be brief cause she ain't got time for me. AM I OVERREACTING?

TLDR: I'm in a toxic relationship, I asked a friend to listen to my concerns, and she cancelled on me for four months straight. Now she is leaving for a war zone and wants to meet (for that, not for making sure how I'm managing).",3,1768137801.0,AIO,6,0.8,False
1q9z8hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1q9z8hk/new_years_party_to_remember/,New Years Party to remember!,"I am Jaye. This is lengthy so take your time lol.

It is 2nd January. 

Jaye has not had sex in 8 months, I am sure you remember the story of him feeling guilty about a long term situationship he had. 

One of Jayes new years resolution was to have more fun and enjoy his life more as well as take action more and go for more opportunities as he rarely meets new people or goes to parties. He is generally people pleaser and submissive in nature. 

Jaye has a sex partner who he has not seen in over a year. He wished him merry Christmas and received some dirty texts back which aroused Jaye but he did not expect it. He gets an invite by his sex partner to a party with his 4/5 friends, including himself. His sex partner told him that he knows he doesn’t have much friends and doesn’t go out a lot and wanted to see him. He attends the party via an Uber the sex partner called for him.

He is asked to get drinks (he himself does not drink) on the way and does so. He gets a carton of juice and bubble gum for himself. As soon as he steps into the house he greets everyone including his sex partner. 

He goes into the bathroom to put in contact lenses and they talk but he has no idea what is being said. He comes back into the room but they start arguing to all each boost their ego in front of him because they are all attracted to him. Jaye knows they are al attracted to him he secretly enjoys it and feels like he is the prize. After the heated argument between the 4 friends, one of the friends, Evergreen, leaves as he feels embarrassed. 

There are 4 people now present:

Jaye (20s)

Sex Partner - Andrew (40s)

Host/Owner of house - Marcus (35 - 45)

Best friend to them both - KC (35 - 45)

Marcus is very forward and pushy with Jaye almost trying to claim him before anyone else does. KC and Jaye are talking/flirting and they are enjoying it naturally but Marcus is way more forward and overt. 

Jaye starts drinking and states he does not drink often. KC keeps edging him on to drink more. They are all having fun. Jaye is very friendly and comfortable. He has ADHD and has previously been bullied all his life regarding his feminine and soft mannerisms so he trained himself to mask it at all times. He has recently let that mask down around people, however this is the first time he is doing it with complete strangers (Outside of Andrew). They are all very masculine men, and he is not. They are all very welcoming and very attracted to him. 

There were various points throughout the night where Jaye was blowing big bubbles of his gum and he noticed them staring at him but acted like he didn’t and continued watching the TV. KC even said at one point ‘I know you see me staring at you’ to which played dumb. 

Another person (Tee) arrives and Marcus goes to meet him at his car and brings drinks/food in and asks Jaye to come with him, Jaye blindly agrees. 

When they return Jaye packs the food into Marcus’s freezer in front of everyone just out of kindness or subconscious people pleasing. Afterwards when everyone is settled, he is looking through Marcus’ phone pictures and instagram pictures cuddled up with Marcus but still in the group on the Sofa. He notices previous love interests and sex partners he had had many years ago (including his first real romantic interest and person who took his virginity at 17) he has had were former clients of Marcus’ hair business. He also notices celebrities and influencers too, a few of them being queer - all the ones he recognised were undercover/in the closet, which made Jaye think little… 

He tries not to reveal anything but does mention he has seen some of these people around. Marcus says he would cut Jaye’s hair at a discount because Jaye often struggles with a good haircut. Jaye is excited by this idea. Marcus also said that he doesn’t approach any of his clients how he is approaching Jaye even if he’s approaching them to remain professionalism. 

KC was speaking with Jaye as they were all next to each other on the couch. Jaye pointed out KC’s ring and asked ‘if he knows his WiFi is here’. KC played along really well to the point where Jaye actually believed him and wrote him off in his head as he did not want to entertain anyone with a partner. He jokingly mentioned this to KC. KC responded by doubling down the flirting. He also asked Jaye to ‘dance for him’ which raised Jaye’s suspicions as to whether he was actually single or bi or not. KC was much more discreet regarding his sexuality than Marcus. They were all very much Masculine presenting men. Jaye also had a brief discussion with Marcus when looking at his phone and said he doesn’t judge anyone and that everyone likes what they like. He also said that Jay should definitely come out of the house more and be more sociable and take risks as Jay was explaining that’s what he wants to do more with his life starting this new year. Jaye also mentioned he thought everyone apart from him and Andrew were straight, especially Tee and Marcus mentioned that while he won’t reveal who is queer, that Jaye should never judge a book by its cover. 

When Andrew and the new guest: Tee (27 - 40) went to get more drinks, Marcus kissed Jaye surprisingly in front of KC. KC went to the bathroom. Jaye wasn’t very thrilled with the kiss but he still enjoyed the attention he was receiving. He kept whispering in Jayes ear that ‘He was going to fuck him all night’ when Jaye said he might leave in an hour or so. Marcus said you can’t leave until morning and Jaye said he’s not having sex tonight however this whole exchange could be seen as Jaye playing hard to get as he was smiling and passive during this these interactions as he constantly smiles. Jaye constantly smiles when interacting too which is perceived as warm and ‘cute.’ KC also said to Jaye’ ‘that’s your type’ about Tee who was 6ft+ and had tattoos, braids and was telling his stories about being in prison and getting into fights. Jaye said that it’s not his type to which KC insisted it was. Jaye thought that this may have been KC’s insecurities as he looked the opposite of Tee and Marcus was constantly flirting with Jaye and looked very identical Tee. When Jay was looking through the phone he saw pictures of Tee before he arrived and thought tee looked like Marcus, to which Marcus kept referring Tee as ‘twin’ and asking everyone if they look alike. When Jaye asked KC what his type was he KC mentioned big boobs and women, and Jaye was even more confused, but noticed he mentioned the only trait women have that men don’t when typically talking about attractiveness and sensed he was avoiding mentioning what he finds attractive on women on purpose. 

Later on Jaye spotted a nude in Marcus phone and showed him and Marcus laughed. Jaye said multiple times that he does not drink but agreed to drinking on this occasion as a new year’s celebration.  Marcus told KC to chill out and when they kept pouring shots for each other he told Jaye not to drink anymore and made him pour the shots he was offered into his own cup because Jaye repeatedly refused to drink as he started to feel drunk. He was a little drunk himself. Also bear in mind Jaye was still under the effects of Elvanse medication. 

They offered Jaye food to which he refused. When insisted he took a couple bites and left it alone. Jaye went upstairs into the kitchen where Andrew and KC were plating food they had cooked. He used this opportunity to tell Andrew that Marcus kissed him and if it was ok. Andrew said it was fine but he knows Marcus can be pushy when he is drunk. 

When the final guest Elba arrived he was behaving slightly off and when Marcus introduced him to Jay he did not maintain eye contact or even look at Jaye. Jaye however kept asking him if he was okay and offered him a sweet he was eating to which he accepted. He also asked him if he wanted to sit down out of concern that he was standing in the corner.  Marcus took note of this and said that Jay is really sweet for this, almost surprised. Earlier when Evergreen said that they had all been friends for 10 years; Jaye replied ‘aww, that’s so nice’ and KC was shocked and said that Jaye said this and mentioned it. Jaye also has a dazed/aloof look sometimes which can come across innocent or cute in comparison to promiscuous. Jaye had ADHD and sometimes believes he does it on purpose to look more innocent subconsciously but isn’t entirely sure. He may also sometimes just be deep in thought. 

When speaking and bantering with KC, They were all sitting one couch in this order:KC, Jaye, Marcus, Elba. Andrew and Tee are sitting on separate arm chairs around the coffee table.  

Afterwards, Marcus came upstairs and led Jaye into the bedroom next door where he kissed him repeatedly. Whilst Jaye was kissing Marcus Andrew came into the bedroom to use the ensuite bathroom but quickly left as if he was interrupting however there is a bathroom downstair too. Since he left Andrew in the kitchen next door he was unsure if the bathroom downstairs was occupied or whether Andrew came in on purpose. Jaye said he wanted to go back downstairs but still stayed with Marcus. 

They then had sex. Jaye did stop a few times but was not firm in setting the boundary. He was secretly enjoying the beginning of the sex but not very much towards the end. He did feel a little pressured but Bothe parties were drunk, not entirely drunk but tipsy at least.

Marcus asked Jaye to please him anally in the heat of the moment. Marcus’ sexual role is versatile and Jaye is a bottom but because of the power dynamics sexually between the two, Marcus is more dominant and therefore topping in this situation. 

Jaye set a boundary and outright refused. Jaye is unsure whether Marcus got embarrassed or not and proceeded to try his hardest to make Marcus happy sexually outside of the anal play that was requested. Marcus said he wanted Jaye to orgasm which is something that he doesn’t experience often sexually with other men. Jaye also stopped anally after a while because it hurt him however in the beginning he was really enjoying it. 

Jaye orgasmed and then it took a while but Marcus also orgasmed. 

He went downstairs first claiming if they both went back downstairs together it would look suspicious. Jaye lay on the bed waiting for Marcus to come upstairs with a bit of a blank mind but also aware that after he organised Marcus became noticeable less touchy and affectionate. He waited for about 15 minutes playing on his phone but Marcus didn’t return.

KC, Tee and Elba all remained downstairs.

Andrew came upstairs and spoke to Jaye telling him that he didn’t expect Jaye and Marcus to actually have sex and Jaye expressed how he thinks that they all probably think he’s an easy slut. Andrew reassured him and said that is not the case and they all like his personality and vibe but that Jaye is also extremely attractive and that they all like him (KC, Evergreen, Andrew and Marcus). Marcus was just first to jump in and pursue him. He also said he knows when Marcus gets drunk he’s super pushy. Andrew said next time he needs to establish firm boundaries so that he earns respect quicker, but knows Jaye is soft and a people pleaser at present. Jaye agreed however he wonders why this information wasn’t given to him before he arrived. 

Andrew said that the 4 friends never speak to each other about the sex they have with each other so they don’t even know they had sex and that Andrew only knows because Jaye just told him.

Whilst there is evidence Jaye had noticed to support this Jaye is still unsure. 

Evidence for this claim includes: 

\- When altogether- the conversation never turned sexual even if sexual songs and music videos were playing on the screen, Andrew never alluded to anything sexual. 

\- When Jaye repeatedly asked both Andrew and Marcus what Andrew had said about him before he arrived, they both said he didn’t mention anything about sex.

\- When Marcus and Jaye finished having sex, Marcus said he wanted to go down first so it doesn’t look suspicious and that maybe it will look like I’m resting or napping because Jaye was drunk. 

Evidence against this claim includes:

\- How did they know Jaye was a bottom on arrival (Note: Jaye assumed they were all tops but Jaye was wrong, Marcus turned out to be verse. Jaye also didn’t know they were all bi. Jaye only knew about Andrew. (This could purely be assumed because of his submissive/Soft energy in stark comparison to everyone else in the room).

\- Andrew was telling Jaye about their business so why wouldn’t he telll them Jaye’s business - however, he was sexual with Jaye and mentions he sees him in a different light. 

Evidence to support this includes:

\- Andrew mentioned Marcus and KC’s former relationship to Jaye so why wouldn’t they speak about Marcus’s sex life to each other?

\- They all spoke about Evergreen when he left and how he has too much pride and ego. 

\- They’ve known each other for 10+ years, whereas Jaye has only known Andrew for 5 (which has not been consistent at all. This is the first time they had met in over a full year).

He also said that Marcus and KC used to be an item 10 years ago but are now just best friends. extremely sexy. Andrew also mentions that Jaye has natural sex appeal and is very sexy, to which Jaye struggles to acknowledge and doubts even though he knows they are all attracted to him. 

Elba was told to leave as he was being disrespectful downstairs to Marcus. He also tried to steal Tee’s Golden bracelet. while Tee had fallen asleep/passed out. Andrew also said to Marcus not to let people take advantage of his kindness as he was giving Elba a place to stay since he was currently homeless and also gave him a free haircut.

Afterwards they all (Andrew, KC, Marcus and Jaye) chilled together comfortably until the early morning. Marcus was extremely angry and shouted at him, insulted him and kicked him out. He brought everyone’s stuff upstairs and everyone chilled in the bedroom. Jaye was already on the bed lying on the bed (With all his clothes on) because he didn’t go back downstairs after him and Marcus had sex. Marcus got under the covers he was cold and since Jaye was already on the bed he said why not and took only his trouser (not his underwear or hoodie or hat) off and went underneath the covers too. Marcus tried to cuddle him but Jaye refused and then he put his trousers back on after remembering the conversation he just had with Marcus. Marcus fell asleep and Jaye continued to talk and have fun with Andrew and KC. He mainly flirted and spoke with KC as he liked him the most. Jaye also playfully showed KC glimpses of nudes (Not full on nudes) on his phone to which KC’s flirting became way more direct. Jaye was also now aware he was not married as Andrew had clarified during their talk so the flirting was much more direct. They had a back and forth banter too which was interesting and not typical conversation or flirting to Jaye. Jaye jokingly even called KC his boyfriend to which KC didn’t deny but sarcastically entertained. 

Andrew told Jaye to tell him when they should leave and start making decisions and being authoritative. So he did and the two left. Andrew told Jaye that Tee was interested in him and they exchanged numbers when they went to get drinks earlier which surprised Jaye. Tee was the only one who didn’t overtly express romantic or sexual interest in Jaye but after hearing that he noticed that Tee is most likely a bottom but just extremely masculine, to which Andrew expressed he likes. Andrew said that his attraction for Jaye is rare and also comes from respect because he is so soft but also has extreme sex appeal and is submissive. 

When Andrew and Jaye arrived at Andrew’s house, Andrew attempted to have sex with Jaye to which Jaye refused. (Note: Andrew and Jaye usually have rough sex when engaging in intercourse). Andrew kept going until Jaye said this is turning into rape - to which Andrew stopped. He then said he was going to delete Jaye’s number because ‘how can Jaye fuck his friend and not fuck him’. Jaye allowed for it to happen and just let Andrew have sex with him while he didn’t really do anything, he mainly just lay there. Andrew didn’t orgasm and said it was because he was still drunk and Jaye, mentioned that he was the one who told him to have boundaries and so he is enforcing them now but you still refused. Andrew started apologising and said he let his arousal and intoxication take over him. He said he wan’t jealous but Jaye thinks he was. Jaye didn’t know how to feel about the interaction. He put his clothes on and mentioned how he feels like a sex toy to everyone and Andrew told him that’s not the case. Jaye also thinks nobody respects him, but Andrew despite what he just done said he did respect him and that if he didn’t he wouldn’t have paid for all Jaye’s Ubers and invited him out and spoke to him and gave him reassurance after Marcus. Jaye also took Andrew out for his birthday a few years back. 

Jaye thought that the advice he gave him during the talk after he had sex with Marcus was extremely parental and sweet but now he did not know what to think. Jaye really enjoyed all the attention he received, however he did not enjoy the interaction with Andrew the next day. Jaye wishes he did not have sex with Marcus and went home in the morning instead of back to Andrew’s house. Andrew also said that the guys will definitely text Jaye later, but even when Marcus asked, Jaye didn’t put his number in Marcus’ phone. Jaye jokingly asked KC what his number was during the boyfriend banter but KC made a joke and then they were shortly interrupted by the Uber arriving. 

Secretly Jaye wants to see them again to change their perception he thinks they have of him being an easy slut. Jaye also kept mentioning he hasn’t had se for up to 8 months and that all of this has made him sexually frustrated. Andrew asked if he was thinking of having sex with all of the guys at the same time (group sex) but Jaye declined. (Secretly Jaye did not know). 

Andrew did show Jaye some other bisexual guys who he also invited who were also attractive bottoms too, but they could not attend for various reasons, however they all said next time. The only way is either through Andrew inviting him to another house party/gathering or him staying in contact with Marcus as he took down his instagram but did not follow him yet. He also doesn’t twant to ask for the number.

Andrew has not said anything to Jaye yet and 1 and a half days have passed. Jaye messaged Andrew last night ‘Why haven’t you checked up on me’ but deleted it soon after, showing a message was deleted but not the actual words themselves. This is via WhatsApp. The next day, today - He has called him (to which Jaye had missed) and texted: ‘Hey J, are you okay?’. 

Jaye said he’s just taking some time off and that he’s good. Andrew said he must keep in touch and that he’s a very good person. Jaye does not answer.

Jaye has been extremely horny and keeps replaying that night in his head all week.

Big houses with multiple bedrooms, high ceilings, and space that often goes unused. Big cars and trucks dominating the roads, even when the only cargo is a coffee and a backpack. And with all of that come big bills: long mortgages, hefty car payments, insurance for everything, and constant upkeep just to keep the lifestyle running.

From the outside, it feels like “bigger” is closely tied to success. Smaller homes or simpler choices don’t seem celebrated they feel like something people are expected to move past.

This isn’t meant as an attack, just an observation. It sometimes seems like the pursuit of big things also brings bigger pressure and less freedom. And I can’t help but wonder if simpler choices might leave more room to breathe.",2,1768137736.0,TalksMoney,4,0.75,False

1q9z7gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1q9z7gq/is_this_whats_been_making_me_tired_my_entire_life/,Is this what's been making me tired my entire life?,"I randomly stumbled on this subreddit through a comment chain and something clicked with my lived experience, and I wanted to ask the people here who have more experience and knowledge if this fits:

* **I'm always tired and I've been always tired since I was a kid, I don't even remember what not being tired and having energy even feels like**, all blood tests always came back normal and I've had probably 50 blood tests over my life since the tiredness never goes away I test 1-2 a year (iron levels normal, thyroid hormones normal, BMI normal (slightly underweight even) inflammation markers normal. I had some undiagnosed food allergies but once they were eliminated I was still permanently tired and it sadly didn't make a difference)

* **No matter how much I sleep, I wake up tired**, if I sleep 8 hours or 12 hours I will still wake up tired and stay tired throughout the day

* If I try to take a nap or multiple naps during the day, I feel the same as if I hadn't slept or I (most of the time) feel even worse than before the nap (20min or 1 hour naps its all the same I feel even worse)

* Often in the early afternoon (think 12 - 2PM) I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open, I often have to force myself to stay alert as the tiredness gets much worse

* This only happens once every 2-3 days but 30 minutes or so after I eat a large lunch (or a large breakfast) in the afternoon I will literally fall to sleep for like 5-30 seconds in my chair or at my desk. I can't even force myself to stay awake a lot of the time, I just fall asleep without realizing it for a few seconds. My eyes will start to feel incredibly heavy and I can barely keep them open then I will just fall asleep and wake myself up after a few seconds, then it'll happen again a few moments later repeating a few times unless I really force myself with all my willpower to keep my eyes open then I barely hold on a lot of the time to not fall asleep instantly.

* I rarely drink coffee (so it's not tolerance) but **Coffee or caffeine does absolutely nothing for my tiredness or energy levels**. I can drink 5 cups of straight Black coffee back to back and there will be 0 difference in how tired I feel, it's as if coffee or caffeine pills have 0 effect on my tiredness or energy levels.

* I don't drink alcohol, I do not smoke and I do not do weed or other drugs


**But**

* In the evening I fall asleep with ease, I've never had trouble falling asleep within 15-30 minutes of lying down. I've never had issues with actually falling asleep, except in hotels/while traveling, where I find it very hard to actually fall sleep, but once I do fall asleep I usually sleep uninterrupted for a similarly long time. 

* I sleep uninterupted or wake up 1 a night to go to the bathroom and fall asleep immediately afterwards with no issues. I've never had any trouble falling asleep for as long as I can remember and I'll sleep for 10-12+ hours every day unless an alarm wakes me up (and im then still tired) My average sleep time due to my schedule is 8-9 hours, but even sleeping 10-12 hours for longer periods still has be constantly tired.

* I've never had sleep paralysis or hallucinations 
____

I don't snore or have breathing problems (no asthma, or breathing allergies) but I've also never had a sleep apnea study or a sleep study (I sleep terribly in unfamiliar places like when on vacation or hotels)

___

Does this sound familiar to anyone? It sort of fits what I've seen people talking here, but I've also never had issues falling asleep or staying asleep during the night, so I'm unsure. I'm just permanently tired, 0 energy and permanently sleepy every day since as long as I can remember.

I've been thinking of getting a sleep study done, but I sleep horribly in unfamiliar places so I don't know how useful that would be",1,1768137708.0,Narcolepsy,3,1.0,False

1q9z5ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialtyCoffee/comments/1q9z5ur/can_you_actually_taste_terroir/,Can you actually taste terroir?,"Time to time Im always wondering whether my taste is underdevelopped when people start talking about terroir in videos. Here is the thing - 

I can often taste:

1. Processing - the most distinctive part that I can disceern

2. Varietal - comes after processing for me

3. Altitude - usually can tell based on richness but that I feel like often has to do more with how coarse I had to grind and solubility

  
I think a lot of people, when they say ""oh yeah this tastes like kenya"" its just a washed SL28 and if it was from Panama or Columbia it would taste the same. At least this is the case for me - if you give me a clean geisha, I always think its either columbian or panaman, but I cant really tell. Could be costa rican and I would be able to tell you. Or with some fancy method of caturra, its always columbia. Literally the only coffees I can tell instantly are pepe jijons washed coffees, and it doesnt matter whether its geisha or sidra, it just has that unmistakable signature that other washed geishas and sidras just dont have. But other than that, Im completely dependent on tasting process, varietal and altitude. 

So my question is - can you actually taste the terroir? The soil, the climate, the altitude, humidity, as in wine? Because I really struggle to discern this in coffee. If you gave me a high grown ethiopian heirloom grown in Colombia I wouldnt know, and its literally across the planet.",2,1768137575.0,SpecialtyCoffee,0,1.0,False

1q9z4q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muslim/comments/1q9z4q1/should_i_still_stay_with_him_or_consider_divorce/,Should I still stay with him or consider divorce? Help.,"Salam guys, I’m here once again to ask for help because I’m on the edge of asking for divorce and I’m thinking if there’s still hope or no. So this time I will write the whole background for better understanding.

Me 25F convert from Poland, married 31M born Muslim from Morocco, 5 months ago.

He came to Germany when he was 17 yrs old, started Ausbildung and worked as a nurse. He had a marriage once, just for papers but they catch him (now he has no problems connected with that legally). He said it was mistake. And he said he did many mistakes in his life, he was gambling, many things… but last year decided to change his life completely and become better and he prayed in Ramadan to find a good wife. I also prayed that I want to get married, so here we are now.

Before I moved, we met like 3 times and decided to do the Nikkah at 3rd meeting. My parents agreed to that, however they’re not Muslim, so my Wali was the Imam. The Imam didn’t ask for my mahr, no one actually asked and my husband was very happy about that. I brought this topic many times to go there and ask Imam for Nikkah papers (because we still don’t have them) and my mahr. But he’s saying all the time we will, but we never go there. Now we were planning to marry legally but I started to think about it, if it’s a good idea. Firstly he was really good for me, he was grateful that he met me so he can start a new life. Then when I came here, we started to see that we’re a bit different in few things. I’m sure I’m anxiously attached and he’s avoidant. He started to be really angry after some time, that I want to spend so much time with him, but I moved here for him and he’s my only family here. I was feeling really alone but also I feel like when I love someone I want to see them often. One time he was so angry that he said to me that I should pack my bags and go the ….. back to my country or he will call the police. After this fight he apologised but since then I started to feel really anxious. On the one hand I’m scared of him and on the other hand I want us to be like at the beginning - just enjoying ourselves and be happy. But I think this time is gone. He changed job, started to be depressed that he didn’t build anything for 15 years in here just wasted his time. But is this the reason to pull me away? Why at the beginning he could be happy with me and now not? I think there’s also my fault in that because I treated him like my best friend and husband and all in one person and he couldn’t take it. As I said I’m for sure anxiously attached.

But now, he said he doesn’t want to spend time with me, maybe once per week because “he needs to focus on himself and fix himself”. He said he feels like a prisoner with me and that the only thing we do is arguing. But he doesn’t understand we argue because I don’t want a man who’s not praying, watching TV 6 hours per day while being depressed he’s not achieving things. I’m trying to focus on myself now too and do my hobbies but every time I think about how it was on beginning brings tears to my eyes. Also, we’re living with his brother because he’s also doing an Ausbildung and my husband promised he can live with him until he’s finished. His brother is never supporting me even if he’s saying behind my husbands back that he’s such a bad person, he would never say that in his face. I live in constant tension, I feel observed by his brother. My husband wants to sit on the TV with me in the living room in which his brother is often too and he doesn’t understand we need privacy. Last time I accidentally saw two things in my husbands phone - few videos of girls in sports tight clothes sticking their …. to the camera and a secret account which looked empty. To both of them he reacted that he doesn’t know why it’s there. His brother said he also has some girls on his insta so my husband didn’t feel at all that it’s wrong. I said I don’t trust him anymore - he said “so find someone who you’ll trust then”.

I still like to spend time with my husband sometimes but now mostly he’s on the TV, in the gym, with his friends on a coffee. He can’t plan anything for us, he tells me to plan but he has no problem to plan with his brother or friends. He said it’s because I’m never grateful and I only think about his money. I slowly stop to have feelings for him I think. I realise his only hobby is watching TV and gym, we don’t really have much to talk about since he’s not even trying to talk with me. There are still some nice moments, like when he comes to the kitchen and give me a kiss or we go to the park but it’s only few times like this per week so mostly I feel like I’m a stranger to him. And whenever I bring this up he says he can’t with me anymore. And I can’t anymore with him too, slowly. There’s a thing that made me realise he might be avoidant that whenever I say something like “now I will not have time for you because \[I will make my portfolio/etc.\]” his eyes light up and he seems happy that we will be in no contact and he starts complimenting me, which makes me more sad because I feel he’s only into me when I pull him away too…",1,1768137479.0,Muslim,0,1.0,False
1q9z4f8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1q9z4f8/how_to_overcome_social_anxiety_3_sciencebacked/,How to Overcome Social Anxiety: 3 Science-Backed Steps That ACTUALLY Work,"I used to think social anxiety was just ""being shy"" until I watched myself turn down opportunities for YEARS because of it. Job interviews I bombed. Parties I skipped. Conversations I never started. After diving deep into research from neuroscientists, therapists, and social dynamics experts like Matthew Hussey, I realized most of us are fighting this battle with the wrong weapons. Social anxiety isn't a personality flaw, it's a learned response your brain developed to protect you. The problem? That protection system is outdated as hell and actively ruins your life. But here's the good news: you can retrain it.

Stop treating anxiety like the enemy

This sounds backwards but hear me out. Your anxiety isn't trying to torture you, it's trying to keep you safe. Your amygdala (the fear center in your brain) can't tell the difference between an awkward conversation and a genuine threat. It just sees potential rejection and hits the panic button. Dr. Judson Brewer's research on anxiety shows that when you try to suppress anxious thoughts, they actually get LOUDER. Instead, acknowledge them. ""Ok brain, I see you're worried about looking stupid. Thanks for trying to protect me. We're doing this anyway."" Sounds cheesy but this simple acknowledgment stops the anxiety spiral before it starts. 

Matthew Hussey talks about this in his work on social confidence. He says anxiety thrives in the gap between your current state and the situation you're about to face. When you accept that gap exists instead of fighting it, the anxiety loses half its power. You're not trying to be perfectly calm anymore, you're just someone who's nervous AND doing the thing anyway.

Exposure therapy but make it micro

The traditional advice is ""just put yourself out there!"" which is about as helpful as telling someone with a broken leg to ""just walk it off."" Dr. Ellen Hendriksen's book How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety is INSANELY good on this. She's a clinical psychologist at Boston University and breaks down why jumping into the deep end usually backfires. Your brain needs proof that social situations won't kill you, but that proof has to come in doses small enough that you don't completely freak out and reinforce the fear.

Start stupidly small. Like embarrassingly small. Week one: make eye contact with a cashier and say thanks. Week two: ask a stranger for the time. Week three: give someone a genuine compliment. The goal isn't to become a social butterfly overnight, it's to collect evidence that nothing terrible happens when you interact with humans. Your amygdala needs data, not motivation.

Hussey's approach in his Get The Guy method is similar. He recommends the ""three second rule"" for social anxiety. When you see an opportunity to interact (cute person at the coffee shop, potential friend at an event), you have three seconds to act before your brain talks you out of it. Not three seconds to plan the perfect opening line, three seconds to just START. Say literally anything. ""Hi."" ""Cool shirt."" ""Is this seat taken?"" The content matters way less than breaking the freeze response.

One tool that genuinely helped me practice this is Finch. It's technically a self care app with a little bird you take care of, but it has daily ""adventures"" that are basically micro challenges for social anxiety. Stuff like ""text a friend you haven't talked to in a while"" or ""introduce yourself to someone new."" Having it gamified made the exposure therapy feel less terrifying and more like leveling up a character.

Another resource worth mentioning is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app recommended by a friend at Google. It pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books to create personalized audio content on whatever you're trying to work on, including social skills and anxiety management. 

What makes it different is the adaptive learning plan it builds based on your specific struggles. Tell it about your social anxiety patterns, and it generates podcasts you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples and strategies. The depth control is clutch because sometimes you need just the essentials, other times you want the full breakdown. Plus you can pick voices that don't make you want to skip, which matters when you're listening during your commute or at the gym.

Shift from performance to curiosity

This is the game changer nobody talks about. When you're socially anxious, every interaction feels like a performance where you're being judged. Hussey points out that this creates a self fulfilling prophecy because when you're in your head worrying about how you're coming across, you're not actually connecting with the other person. They pick up on that disconnection and the interaction feels awkward, which confirms your fear that you're bad at socializing.

The fix is deceptively simple: get genuinely curious about the other person. Ask questions you actually want answers to. Notice details about them. Dr. Hendriksen's research shows that anxiety drops dramatically when you redirect focus outward instead of inward. Your brain can't simultaneously worry about being judged AND be genuinely interested in someone else's story about their chaotic roommate or weird hobby.

I started using this at networking events (my personal hell). Instead of preparing an elevator pitch about myself, I'd prepare three questions I was genuinely curious about. ""What made you get into this field?"" ""What's the weirdest project you've worked on?"" Suddenly I wasn't the awkward anxious person in the corner, I was just someone having actual conversations. The anxiety didn't disappear but it became background noise instead of the main event.

The deeper work

If your social anxiety is severe or tied to past trauma, these tips are just the starting point. Insight Timer has excellent guided meditations specifically for social anxiety from therapists like Tara Brach. Her work on self compassion is crucial because a lot of social anxiety stems from harsh self judgment. You wouldn't judge a friend for being nervous, so why are you destroying yourself for it?

Also worth checking out: Dr. Aziz Gazipura's stuff on social confidence. His book Not Nice digs into how people pleasing and social anxiety are connected. Sometimes you're not actually afraid of social situations, you're afraid of disappointing people or not being liked. That's a different beast that requires examining your core beliefs about self worth.

Look, I still get anxious before social events. The difference is it doesn't run my life anymore. I've collected enough evidence that I can handle awkward moments, boring conversations, even straight up rejection. Your brain will catch up eventually but you have to feed it the right data. Start small, stay curious, stop treating anxiety like it makes you defective. You're just a human with an overprotective alarm system.

1q9z462,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1q9z462/i_dont_think_my_longterm_relationship_is_working/,I don’t think my long-term relationship is working out …,"TL;DR - My long-term partner has gotten extremely controlling, hates where we’ve moved to, and I’m exhausted trying to make it work and don’t know how to move forward. 

I (36F) have been dating my partner (40F) for ten years. I knew from the start we had some differences (she didn’t like that I have a dog) and that she could be a little difficult (she sent me a cleaning schedule for my own house when we first started dating), but we navigated these things pretty well. The first few years of our relationship were a complete joy. We traveled, tried new restaurants, and just had fun together. We wanted the same things, and it was exciting to plan for a future together. Three years into our relationship, we both took jobs in another state (the state she has always dreamed of living in), and things immediately changed. Her temper grew shorter. She got more controlling. Intimacy vanished overnight and has largely stayed gone. She teleworked and started wanting me home all the time (I worked a 9-5 onsite job but she’d always ask why I couldn’t leave at 3:00 if I had finished all my work or why I couldn’t telework for a day if I only had computer work). She got jealous any time someone from work invited me to coffee or lunch, so I literally made no friends. It was just her and I for years and years. I made excuses for why she changed and why we had so much tension in our relationship: the stress of the move, our expenses, then the pandemic, etc. The other state we were living in was insanely expensive, and I got really, really sick in 2021 (everyone thought I was going to die, and my partner was a full-time, extremely devoted caretaker). After years of living in that other state, seeing no long-term future because of how expensive it was, missing the hell out of my family, and generally being exhausted after clawing my health back (I literally had to regain my ability to walk), I put my foot down and said no more. I wanted a less stressful lifestyle out of that state. I moved about a year ago to the state and town my family lives in, which is also much more affordable. She didn’t come with me, stating she needed to hold out for a new, better job (hers was remote but she had to be within an hour’s commute of the main office). When she finally got the new job, I asked her if she truly wanted to move here and said we could keep things long-distance if living in the other state made her happier. Honestly, we were having a great time traveling to meet each other, and our relationship was like it was before we moved. She said she wanted to move and did so a few months ago. I was optimistic because she seemed so excited, and things were going so, so well. Well, she hates it here. She hates this state. She’s jealous of the time I spend with my family (she’s had several meltdowns). She hates my new 9-5 onsite job and wants me to quit and be fully remote like her. She hates my gym schedule (which I’ve stressed is critically important to me considering how sick I was). My hobbies annoy her because they take too much of my time. I have made no friends outside of my family because she’s concerned that time with other people takes time away from us. We’ve talked. A lot. And fought. More than I care to admit. To her credit, I can see that she’s really, really trying (she’s completely stopped the meltdowns over my family, though I can tell she still doesn’t like the time I spend with them). I’ve brought up therapy. She refuses. She’s been visiting her family in another state, and honestly, I’m the happiest I’ve been in a while. We had a really fantastic time while we were long distance. Our relationship completely revived. But now we’re back to our post-move patterns. So, my question is, we’ve been in a relationship for a decade. At what point do I decide the relationship we once had isn’t coming back and that we are no longer compatible and want different things? Or, since she is very obviously making an effort (albeit slowly), do I give her the time she needs to adjust to our new life here and fight for a 10-year relationship that was once really, really special but might be a little different than what I remember moving forward?

1q9z45s,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1q9z45s/just_launched_my_app_built_it_because_i_was/,Just launched my app - built it because I was spending 2 hours a day on spreadsheets,"Hey everyone

After mass lurking here for months, I finally have something to share. Just launched Metricx on Product Hunt today.

Quick backstory: I've run ads for my own brands/stores for 3 years. I got so frustrated with the tab-switching and spreadsheets that i had to fill in to know if im profitable and wich campaigns are performing good right now.

Just answering ""which campaigns should I kill today?"" took 30-45 minutes. It's brutal.

The real thing that drove me crazy though is when i'm out getting coffee or when at the gym, i want to check my numbers, not just shopify revenue. I want to see actual campaign-level stats. Wich adsets are spending? What's my ROAS per campaign looking like right now? are my new creatives converting or do i need to kill?

If you run ad accounts on proxies(and let's be real, most of the guys that are dropshipping do), you literally cannot check your ads unless you're on your laptop with things like icogniton open. You are literally flying blind until your at your desk. That's insane, especially when spending thousands a day.

**What I built:**

Metricx connects your Meta and Google ad accounts and lets you ask questions like you're talking to a colleague:

* *""Which ad sets are burning money?""*
* *""Show me everything with ROAS below 2 that's spent more than $100""*
* *""Compare Campaign A vs Campaign B last 7 days""*
* *""What should I turn off?""*

The AI actually understands campaign structures, it knows what ad sets are, how to calculate ROAS, how to compare date ranges. It's not just keyword matching.

What used to take me 30+ minutes now takes about 10 seconds. I'm not exaggerating. I use it every single day for my own accounts. And I can finally check real campaign stats from my phone - no proxy, no laptop, no BS. Just pull it up and ask ""how are my ads doing today?""

**The build**

* 6 months building
* Solo founder (shoutout Claude)
* Stack: Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL

You just connect your ad accounts and start asking questions. Value in 60 seconds.

Also, i'm looking for 10 founding merchants who are actively running Meta/Google ads and want to help shape this thing. You get lifetime free access, I get honest feedback and help prioritizing features.

DM me if that sounds interesting.

For everyone else: I launched Metricx on Product Hunt today if you want to check it out and show some love. Happy to answer any questions!",1,1768137431.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

Produces wonderful coffee consistently and has about the same cleaning needs as other grind-n-brew type machines. We always keep the grinder and chute area clean and have had zero issues. 

A few weeks ago we noticed the coffee was weaker and saw that the basket had far fewer grinds in it than usual. We also noticed a slight high pitched / whirring sound when beans were grinding. Doesn’t sound like a motor bearing failing sound, more like the action of grinding beans itself is higher pitched. 

Since then we have cleaned the burrs, hopper, chute etc probably about 10 times. We have tried all 6 grind size settings. We have used a small straw/pipe cleaning brush to clean around the bottom burr (which is pressed onto the motor shaft). We have tried multiple brands of coffee beans. But still only getting about half the grinds expected.

We have also used Grindz burr cleaner “beans”, which actually don’t make any funny grinding noise and as you can see in the photo actually do produce a full basket of grinds.

These photos were taken back to back within 3 minutes of each other and with the exact same settings (grind size was 3 I think, and strength was set to 8)

Since Grindz cleaner beans produce a full basket and the coffee beans don’t (and any coffee bean we try makes the strange sound) - we haven’t tried calibration yet as it’s clear this is a burr issue of some sort.

Anyone come across this, and have a solution? Burr doesn’t appear replaceable - as the bottom one is pressed into the motor shaft.

Apparently how you respond to coffee specifically is very much genetic and to do with a handful of genes. Most people will be somewhere in the middle of the road but some minority of the population will have every gene variant of the handful of genes that makes coffee bad for them. 

For these people, coffee degrades their sleep, increases their blood pressure (!) and makes them tired but wired. It actually makes them less productive. 

Tea on the other hand has multiple compounds like L-theanine and polyphenols that completely change the way the caffeine is metabolised and how it effects the brain.

For myself at least tea gives me a gentle, calm alertness which really helps my productivity, while coffee causes me to ruminate on what I need to do but actually makes it harder for my physically do it.

I'm tinkering with a tension/suspense system where the party can receive a condition called a 'Hook,' which is basically a threat/foreshadowing of future bad consequences.

(The game is sci-fi survival/horror. The design goal is to achieve something like in Alien, where the AUDIENCE knows that the facehugger laid an egg inside that guy, but the CHARACTERS haven't gotten there yet)

When you receive a Hook, it gets added to a list with 6 available slots. (Eg. when the facehugger detaches from your face, you receive the Hook ""Alien chestburster emerges"")

There's a Tension pool that can have up to 6 dice. You roll this pool at various times to see if any Hooks trigger.

If you roll doubles on the Tension roll, the Hook numbered with that value triggers. 

Eg. if you roll two 1s, then the Hook in the first slot triggers. If you roll three 2s, then the Hook in the second slot triggers. If you roll two 2s and three 4s, then the Hooks in the second and fourth slots both trigger.

If you trigger an empty slot, nothing happens.

That's the part that's breaking my brain a bit. The probability of triggering a Hook scales with both the # of dice in the Tension pool, AND the # of active Hooks.

I wanted to check the odds to see how the curve changes in different scenarios (eg. rolling 6d6 with only 1 active Hook vs rolling 2d6 with 6 active Hooks, etc.), but I'm struggling a bit.

Would appreciate both help with the math, and also any commentary on the mechanic as described (understanding that I haven't explained things like how you receive Hooks, how you clear Hooks, how you add Tension and trigger Tension rolls, etc.)",3,1768136990.0,RPGdesign,1,1.0,False

I’m a software engineering student and a massive coffee / pre workout addict. For years, I’ve had a problem abusing my caffeine intake.

What it actually does:

\-The ""Curfew"": It tells you the exact time you need to stop drinking to hit 0mg (or your custom threshold) by bedtime.

\-The ""Sleep Risk Analysis"": it warns you if your current dose is going to wreck your sleep schedule and gives you notifications based on your bedtime. 

\-Native & Independent: Built with SwiftUI and SwiftData. The Watch app is fully independent

 (**you can log drinks and check decay without your phone , just your watch!!!**).

\-HealthKit: Syncs with your health data securely in Apple Health.

If that wasn’t an actual period, then the first day of my last period would be November 30th, which according to a due date calculator, that would put me at freshly 6 weeks as of today.

On January 2nd I puked in the morning. The  following days I had very bad acid reflux, indigestion, burning in my throat. Threw up again January 5th. Continued with awful reflux, nausea, indigestion. Threw up again January 8th. I didn’t have any other symptoms and the vomiting is so irregular, but the reflux and nausea is so persistent that it made me think I might be dealing with morning sickness and I didn’t have an actual period like I thought I did. I also started getting lightheaded and dizzy. I threw up again on January 10th. 

I’ve been starting my mornings with breakfast crackers. I’ve been having ginger chews and saltines on hand, as well as ginger ale. I’ve been completely turned off by coffee, my comfort drink, it’s either too sweet, too bitter, just gross. 

I’ve been having Pepcid in the morning and before bed. I’ve been sleeping elevated. I’ve been having bland meals, I’ve taken out acidic foods (except the coffee I’m trying to choke down to avoid caffeine withdrawal headaches.)

I took a blue dye test in the evening on January 9th and got a very very faint positive. Followed the next morning with a still faint but more visible positive. But I’ve been told blue dye tests are not reliable, I followed with a pink dye test this morning (January 11th) the tests were clearly negative.

We used condoms, but our first condom broke in the very beginning, which we immediately noticed and replaced. I didn’t think I could be pregnant initially, now I don’t think I’m pregnant due to negative tests. 

But I can’t help be feel confused because everything lines up so perfectly. If I use November 30th as my last period, my nausea started right around when I would have hit 5 weeks. 

Does anyone have any insight? All the reliable tests come back negative, I know they should be coming back strongly positive at this point, but I can’t help but feel like I’m being duped.",1,1768136663.0,AskHealth,0,1.0,False

I (25F) have been on 4 dates with a guy I met on an app (32M). First date we went for coffee and the second date we played mini golf and kissed at the end. For the 3rd date he invited me to walk a trail near his apartment and to use the hot tub there. It felt a little soon to go to his place but I trusted him so I went for it. We made out at the end which he initiated and then I told him I needed to leave. For the 4th date he invited me to his place on a weekday after work for dinner and to use the hot tub. We cooked together, went in the hot tub, and then watched an episode of a show. After it ended it was 9 pm and I told him I needed to go because I had to get up early for work and he started making out with me and tried to initiate sex. When he told me to take my shirt off I told him I really needed to go because I had to get up early for work. He said “no don’t go” but then said “I’m not gonna make you do anything you’re uncomfortable with”. To me it feels too early for me to have sex with him without any conversation about exclusivity or STI testing. He just invited me on a 5th date over at his place again. Didn’t mention any activities to do just said to come over. We met on an app and both our profiles said looking for long term relationship. Another yellow flag for me is that he made a small update to his profile after the third date, which is totally fair for him to do since we’re not exclusive but I don’t want to sleep with him if he’s actively sleeping with or dating other women. It makes me feel like maybe he wants sex with me while he looks for someone else. I think with previous guys I’ve dated I’m more used to going on dates in public and doing activities in the early stages vs just going to their place for every date. Looking for advice on what to do.

I’ve owned my DeLonghi PrimaDonna Soul (ECAM610.75) for just over 4 years and it was faultless up until 6 months ago. 

I have been having issues whenever any coffee drink is made, the machine grinds the beans but then fails to deliver any coffee. Most often I get a message to “reduce the aroma” but even setting this to minimum does not change anything. 

I have:
- changed the grinder settings up and down
- removed and cleaned the infuser module (this had ‘fixed’ the issue in the beginning)
- attempted to use ground coffee via bypass
- cleaned all accessible parts (without actually taking the machine apart)

I had a problem before this and took it to a repair tech who replaced the solenoid but I’m low-key concerned they did fixed one problem and created another. I am in two minds on just buying a new infuser module and replacing that in case it’s throwing money down the drain.

I’m debating replacing everything with a Baratza Encore ESP Pro, or keeping the OXO for her and adding a small dedicated grinder (like a Lagom Mini) for me and the 1-2 shots I pull a day.

My main question is: Is the ESP Pro actually viable for switching back and forth daily? Specifically, if I leave the hopper full for her drip, then clear it to single-dose my espresso, is the retention and dial-twisting going to be a nightmare?

He ate his breakfast and said ""Thank You."" To his cook for eggs just like he loved them with slices of Porcupig and potatos.

He sent a quick message via tablet to Marcus ""Meet me at the Inn please."" Marcus responded ""Be there in 10.""

Aino went to the Inn and got a coffee. He was joined by Marcus shortly after. Animated he told Marcus about his idea to have a Baronry web site. They could have town rules which consisted of one rule right. ""No killing white deer."" right now but some rules would be needed.

Animated he told him about having events and classes all could attend and so much more. The woman running the inn said they could post menues that different establishment offer. People could reserve tables etc.

A woman which was siting near by said ""Sorry my lords for interupting. I use to make websites as a hobby. I can easily put one together for the Baronry."" Aino smiled. He was about to ask Marcus if he knew anybody that could do that but as it turns out they just found someone that could. ""Please join us"" Aino asked. She came over and introduced herself as Marjory.

Marcus smiled. Can we get volunteers to run a radio station or Pidcast. Music, news, weather, lost and found etc. We would need Volunteers DJ or news anchirs etc. Maybe we can get the news reporter to provide us with right to resend their newscast.

Aino sent out a message to every tablet in the Baronry. ""Looking for Volunteers to
A) Help run a baronry website.
B) if enough people are interested run a radio station or Baronry podcast.
C) knows about putting out speakers in the square for that radio station. 
D) possible knowledge to have a tower to send out to all the Baronry.

Please contact Aino if you wish to volunteer.

Aino was shocked receiving responses that quick. 

Electricians volunteered to set up speakers and if they could get basic items they could make sure a radio Station could be easily built.

Aino set up a meeting for that evening to discuss all these things. Marjory would create the website that day and with some help could set up reservations and menues for all eating establishments.

To Aino surprise he got 15 people willing to be DJ or Podcasters. The biggest surprise was Sarah the pirate girl. She wanted to create a show ""voice of Youth"" to ensure all Youths voice are heard.because she was in school with her parents permission she could hold a 1 hour show on Sunday.

Aino invited all possible DJ or Podcasters to also join them that night.

Aino asked those running the machine to make him 20 all weather speakers and wiring to be hung around the square. 

An electrician converted some electronics into a small transmitter for the radio station. For now announcements could be made over the speakers. With an antenna this would get much further reach. 

When Elizabeth got off teaching showed up at the meeting also. She offered to do a video podcast once a week explaining the plants and animals. She was getting very busy but could spare an hour a week.

One person wanted to do weekly interviews with people to find out where they are originally from. Aino loved the idea of saving people history in video.

A construction worker offered to build a studio in City Hall and suggested having basic classes for people wishing to learn trades or skills.

So an office was designated as recording studio. 

Basic microphones were donated  and permission to repodcast any news from the reporters from space was received. They also offered sound proofing to help build the BOSF studio.

One person was setting up schedules for DJ's and Podcasters. Sarah and her parent showed up and she got slotted in to run her show from 6 to 7pm every Sunday.

We met randomly at an event. They had loads of issues at that time and I was helping them work through them. They were also being a good friend to me during this time.

I think I’m a good listener and was happy to do this. But after a while it became really difficult to set boundaries with A. Here are some of the examples of A crossing boundaries: 

Firstly: I have sleeping problems because my job is super intense. They know this but would call me anyhow in the middle of the night to complain about minor problems with colleagues at work or seek advice on how to write emails about those colleagues (at 2 and 3am!!!). 

Secondly: (I am guessing because of my sleeping problems: I have a hard time falling asleep - since I was a kid! So I know how to function even though I feel exhausted (though it really is not optimal.)) They would drop subtle hints in our conversations that they believed I suffered from bipolar disorder. (I take my mental health very seriously. I sought out a mental health professional because it truly worried me to think I had a disorder. Basically the professional said there was no chance I had bipolar and just had insomnia for unrelated reasons.)

Third: We don’t exactly see eye to eye on political matters, which is not a problem to me (I have loads of friends whom I disagree with on politics and we are really good friends anyhow, it’s an enrichment I find to get other points of view l). However: Whenever I sought advice from them on an issue I had - (which was seldom because they always see to have something major going on - making me feel like it’s not the opportune moment most of the time to bring up my issues) - they would try to use the situation to subtly bring up a political view of mine that they disagreed with and relate my emotional situation to it to make me feel dumb about the political view (as though it’s because of the „political stance“ inherent to the situation that I’m feeling poorly about it, basically trying to use my problem to change my political stances.)

Fourth: They know about a traumatic thing that happened to me as a teen (SA) which I was in therapy for and have worked through since. And at some point they were dating this person that they seemingly forced to have unprotected sex with. They turned to me because they felt guilty about it and because they wanted reassurance that it was okay what they did (IMHO it wasn’t but they were going through something tough so I tried to make it more about that than saying this is bad or good. Perhaps this was a dumb thing to do on my part in retrospect.)

This is the situation: Person A had this friend whom they introduced me to - let’s call them person B. We get along quite well. They are the only other person I got to know better who also knows A. I was having a hard time in winter and with life and needed some space from A because their problems can be quite consuming and because of all I mentioned above. I was still hanging out with B from time to time though (really not very often, I had many other reliable friends and family helping me through this time.) 

One day I had the capacity to hang out with A and invited them and B to hang out. A simply didn’t reply. B did and we were in the city together. Then we encountered A and they behaved really weird towards me particularly. Perhaps they felt that I was becoming distant? B felt „caught“ but I didn’t understand why, since I had invited A along. Then we all met a week later for Bs birthday. A didn’t even hug me hello or goodbye when I arrived. I though this was fair since after all, I had been distant. They were making the conversation throughout really awkward, too, however and I didn’t know how to deal with this.

Fast forward a month and I and A haven’t reached out to oneanother. I did meet B for a coffee though and we talked all night about random things. Turns out A had invited B for a trip which B didn’t feel up to go on because they were tired that day. And then things just exploded: B was bombarded with texts alleging that we were excluding A and horrible friends because that day B has been meeting with me „behind As back.“

I guess maybe it is unkind that I didn’t invite A to hang out with „their“ friend. After all A is constantly going through a hard time. A and B are both over 30 though and it feels childish to me that  A would think they own the friendship with B (and myself). However: perhaps it’s because I have been distant (without telling A why) that A thinks we’re making som ominous plans to exclude them when we do hang out? In many ways though, my distance to them had less to do with them and more to do with me (I didn’t expect them to be of much help and I also didn’t want to listen to their problems or their political theories for several hours which is usually how things go when we meet and I have a problem.)

Am I an asshole for not being straightforward with them about why I was taking my distance but then being close to „their“ friend?  (I considered telling them but I didn’t because I anticipated that they wouldn’t have accepted this: I get the impression that A idealizes my life and never quite believes me when I claim I’m going through something rough. Also she was going through a hard time / harder time than usual when I was distancing myself from her so I thought she would think it’s because I think her problems are not important OR that I don’t want to hang out with her because she has too many problems.)

I acknowledge that my description would suggest that A is 100% a horrible person. They are not, they can be really kind and fun to be around. Otherwise I would have stopped hanging out with them a long time ago. The reasons above are just given to let you know why I couldn’t hang out with them as of late.

1q9yl2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hotels_India/comments/1q9yl2z/gateway_taj_aurangabad/,Gateway Taj Aurangabad,"Stayed at the erstwhile Vivanta (now Gateway by Taj) in Aurangabad last week — sharing a quick, honest review for anyone planning a trip.

We were there for three nights in the last week of December. Check-in was surprisingly smooth. We reached way before the official time, but the front desk still gave us one room immediately and the second room within an hour. Staff at the reception were polite and efficient — no drama about early check-in, which was a good start.

We had booked one Deluxe Room and one Deluxe Suite, both on the lobby level. The Deluxe Room was quite spacious and even had a small balcony with a swing. The Deluxe Suite is essentially two Deluxe Rooms combined — one used as a living/dining area with a sofa set, dining table, TV, powder room and a balcony swing; the other functioning as the bedroom with its own balcony and full bathroom. Since we were travelling with a 4-year-old, the extra space was genuinely useful.

Rooms were clean, housekeeping was prompt, and room service was quick. Practical details were well thought out — plenty of charging points, AC was easy to control, and the biggest surprise was a Lavazza Blue pod coffee machine in the room (which even many high-end hotels don’t provide). No complaints on the room front at all.

The property is large and nicely laid out. There’s a proper walking/jogging track, big lawns, lots of open space, and a decent-sized swimming pool. We didn’t take a dip because the weather was quite cold, especially in the mornings and evenings, but the pool area itself is quite inviting. There’s no separate kiddie pool, but the main pool has a gentle slope so different depth levels exist. Plenty of cabanas and seating around the pool. Indoors, there’s carrom, chess, foosball and a functional gym.

We had all our meals at their main restaurant. Lunch was à la carte and dinners were buffet. Service was polite but definitely slow during lunch hours. The buffet spread at breakfast and dinner was good, but mostly Indian and Oriental. A couple of simple continental items would have helped, especially for kids (a basic pasta would have solved a lot).

Overall, I’d say it’s a solid property with good value, clean rooms and consistently pleasant staff. Not a luxury “wow” hotel, but very reliable and comfortable. I’d happily stay here again without hesitation.",9,1768135827.0,Hotels_India,0,1.0,False

Warning: >!Blood!<

I pulled up to the curb outside the station just as Paul stepped through the doors, jacket slung over his arm. He paused when he saw me, then grinned. 

“My favorite chauffeur.” He joked as he climbed in. 

“Where to?” I replied 

He shut the door and pulled his phone out, turning it toward me as I eased back into traffic. “Alright. Gab's team got this address from the trace.” The map loaded slowly, then settled. 

“West side,” He said. “Commercial zoning mostly. Offices, storage, a couple light industrial spots. Some residential pockets mixed in.” 

I glanced at the screen, committing the route to memory. “Could be anything, then.” 

“Exactly,” Paul said. “Businesses. Rentals. 
Someone’s old office space.” 

Or a house that doesn’t get visitors, I thought, but didn’t say. 

We headed out of downtown, the buildings thinning and spreading apart as we moved west. Traffic eased. The city felt looser here, less watched. 

I caught him up on Ethan's map as I steered us through the turns. 

“Same dead ends,” I said. “Same places where things stop making sense.” 

“That’s enough to get someone’s attention,” he said. “Whoever is behind this.” 

I nodded in agreement. 

“Whoever they are, they were watching him for a while. That takes planning. Doesn’t feel random.” 

“No,” I said. “It doesn’t.” 

As we crossed deeper into the west side, the buildings grew taller, more utilitarian. Parking garages and old businesses stacked concrete on concrete. 

Paul grabbed the radio. “Dispatch, this is Reddick. I’m requesting any available unit nearby this address to keep a tight patrol and standby for assistance. Possible suspect contact."" 

The acknowledgment came quickly. 

""Just in case."" He added. 

""Good call."" I said. 

We turned down a narrower street, flanked by aging office buildings and fenced lots. 

The address led us farther than I expected, into a stretch that felt barely used and forgotten. I slowed the car as we approached the destination. 

“Well,” he said, brow furrowing, “That’s not a house.” 

The building sat back off to the side. Faded lettering was painted high on the brick. A radio call sign and a channel number, sun-bleached but still legible. Temporary fencing surrounded the property, sections bowed and patched like no one had bothered to finish the job. Windows were dark. Some boarded. Some intact. 

“This place still active?” Paul asked. 

“Doesn’t look like it.” I said. 

“Then why would anything trace here?” 

We parked a short distance away, both of us sitting still for a moment.This wasn’t what either of us had pictured when we punched in the address. 

Paul exhaled slowly. “Alright. That changes things a bit.” 

I adjusted the brim of my hat as we stepped out, the sound of the car door closing echoed once. We stood there for a moment, studying the building, the fence, the other buildings. The lot had several, some two stories like the old radio station, and a parking garage off to the corner. At the far end of the lot looked what appeared to be a door that led down underground. Utility closet perhaps. 

I rubbed my fingers over the bristles of my beard. Whatever had brought us here wasn’t obvious. 

We checked our gear before we left the car, Paul clipping the radio to his belt and tossing his jacket onto the seat. I adjusted my belt too where my short-barreled revolver was holstered, then rolled up the cuffs of my button up shirt. 

We crossed through the gap in the construction fence, our shoes crunching on gravel and old leaves that had collected where no one bothered to sweep anymore. Orange plastic fluttered weakly against a bent post, tapping in the breeze like it was trying to get our attention and failing. 

Paul eyed the front door as we approached. “Place looks like it’s been waiting for a wellness check.” 

I huffed a quiet chuckle.
“Let’s hope it answers better than most.” 

The door wasn’t locked. 

That stopped us both for half a beat.
Paul looked at the handle, then at me. 
“That’s either convenient… or a problem.” 

“Only one way to find out,” I said. 

I pushed the door open. 

The air inside was stale but not rotten. Old dust. Dry carpet. The faint musky smell you get from an aging building that hasn't seen use in a long time. Our footsteps echoed briefly down a hallway that opened up into what had once been the main floor.
The first level looked exactly like what it was: a radio station that had shut its doors mid-life and never came back. Cubicles with sun-faded dividers. A reception desk with a cracked laminate top. Someone had left a coffee mug on a filing cabinet beside a desk. A baseball cap hung on the corner of a chair like its owner had stepped away for a smoke and never returned. 

“Knock knock.” Paul muttered. “Looks like nobody's home.” 

“Yeah,” I said, “Abandoned in time.” 

We moved room to room. Old broadcast offices. A small break area with a dead fridge. Nothing disturbed. Nothing spoke to being currently occupied. If someone had packed up, they’d done it a long time ago. 

Then we found the elevator. 

Paul pressed the call button instinctively. 

Nothing happened. The indicator above the door was dark. 

“Figures,” he said. “Stairs it is.” 

The stairwell smelled different. Colder. Concrete and dust. Our steps echoed tighter here, the sound snapping back quicker, more contained. The further up we went, the less the building felt like a workplace and more like a shell.
The second floor doors opened onto something that didn’t match the first. 

Most of the space was empty. 

Not stripped violently. Just… cleared. No desks. No chairs. No personal clutter. The walls were bare except for faint rectangles where furnishings had once rested. Even the floor seemed unremarkable, just the same carpet as the bottom floor. 

Paul slowed. “Do you hear that.” 

“Yeah,” I said. 

We followed the hum. 

It was faint, easy to miss at first. A low electrical presence, steady and patient. It led us toward the far end of the floor, where the main broadcast room had been. 

The original radio hardware was still there, mixing boards, racks of analog gear, dials yellowed with age. It had been cleaned, dusted, maintained. Cables ran where they should. Indicator lights blinked softly. Someone had brought it back online. 

And then there was the new stuff.
Industrial computer towers. Rack-mounted units stacked cleanly along the wall. Thick cables fed into them, bundled and labeled, disappearing into conduits that hadn’t existed in the station’s original design. Small lights glowed faintly. No branding. Just matte metal cases with cooling fans whispering steadily. 

This wasn’t hobbyist gear. 

“That doesn’t belong here.” I said quietly. 

“No,” Paul agreed. “And it’s not cheap.” 

I stepped closer, careful not to touch anything yet. The contrast was wrong. Old broadcast equipment kept alive, cables re-run to support something newer. 

Paul scanned the room, hand resting near his sidearm. “You still thinking kidnapping?” 

I hesitated. 

“I think...” I said slowly, “Someone’s been involved a lot longer than we have.” 

The hum continued, steady and unconcerned. 

Whatever this place was doing, it wasn’t abandoned. 

A laptop sat at the edge of the table near the humming tower like it had been forgotten.
Not tucked away. Not secured. Just there. Closed, thin layer of dust clinging to the lid. Not enough to suggest years. Weeks, maybe. A month at most. 

“That’s odd,” Paul said. “You don’t just leave something like that.” 

“No,” I said. “You leave it if you expect to come back.” 

I lifted the lid. 

The screen came alive instantly. No boot sequence. No login screen. Whatever had been running hadn’t stopped when the laptop was closed. It had just... waited. A dark interface blinked once and settled into place, lines of text and overlayed graphics filling the display. 

Paul let out a quiet whistle. “Still powered after sitting around this long.” 

The power cable hung off the side of the thin device and ran off into the mass of cables at the floor, plugged in somewhere. 

The first window was simple. Clean. No names. No identifiers. Just timestamps and coordinate data noted down in neat columns. Longitude. Latitude. Altitude. Movement vectors. 

“This looks like GPS tracking.” Paul said, leaning closer. 

“Yeah,” I replied. “But anonymous. No personal data.” 

No phone numbers. No carrier data. Just dots on a map. 

I scrolled. 

One highlighted coordinate made my hand pause. 

Then another. 

Then another. 

“Paul."" I said quietly. 

He followed my finger. 

The old quarry. 

The mountain pass. 

Beneath them dozens of time stamps with coordinates. The entries were brief. Minutes. Seconds. Others lingered for hours. The system didn’t care who they were. Only where they’d been. How long they stayed. How close they got. 

“This isn’t about people,” I said slowly. “It’s proximity. How close they were to.. something.” 

I clicked into another directory. The interface changed. The screen dimmed, replaced by a grid. Faint, translucent lines dividing the area into large square quadrants. The background was dark, grayed out, with pulses of light blooming at different quadrants. 

Small readouts updated in real time. 

Resonance variance.
Harmonic deviation.
Signal coherence: unstable. 

Paul frowned. “What the hell does that mean?” 

“I don’t know,” I said honestly. “But it’s not all GPS data.” 

There were waveforms. Frequencies. Whatever this was “listening” to we didn't have a clue. 

One quadrant pulsed brighter than the rest. 

The forest. 

The same region we’d been circling for years. 

Then Paul stiffened. 

“Derrick.” 

Another point lit up. 

Closer. 

Much closer. 

I leaned in, reading the coordinate overlay.
It was nearly on top of us. But its elevation was underground? 

My eyes dropped to the timestamp. 

Ten minutes ago. 

I felt my stomach tighten. 

“That’s when we entered the building."" Paul said. 

Neither of us spoke for a moment. 

The equipment hummed around us, steady and patient. The building didn’t creak. The air didn’t shift. Nothing obvious had changed. 

And yet... 

Paul straightened, hand moving unconsciously toward his weapon. 

We listened. 

The hum was still there. 

But the room felt… Ominous. 

The laptop chimed softly. 

Another update. 

The underground quadrant pulsed brighter.
Somewhere beneath our feet, something had just moved. 

Paul turned away from the laptop and scanned the room, eyes tracking the walls, the ceiling, the corners where old cables vanished into conduit. 

“Do radio stations usually have sub levels?” he asked. “Basement storage?” 

“Maintenance tunnels,” I added. “For the utilities. Especially with older infrastructures.” 

I closed the laptop but didn’t unplug it. Something about leaving it running felt… Necessary. 

We made our way back down the stairs and found the sub level access tucked into a corner. The door opened with a dry scrape of metal against concrete. 

Cold air spilled out. 

Not a draft exactly. More like the building exhaled. A narrow hallway lead to another doorframe with no door. Beyond the threshold, a stairwell descended into shadows. Concrete steps, narrow and steep, with a handrail bolted directly into the wall. Old light fixtures ran along the ceiling. We flipped the switch, the third one was dark. One of the working ones flickered. 

Paul clicked on his flashlight. The beam cut cleanly down the stairwell, stopping short of the bottom. 

“Tunnel access,” he said. “Or maybe a dungeon.” 

I smirked despite the eeriness. He smirked back, brief and tight. 

“Call it in?” he asked. 

I hesitated. 

If this was a kidnapping, we were about to step onto someone else’s turf. If it wasn’t… I wasn’t sure what we were walking into. 

“Yeah, just in case.” I said. 

Paul nodded and keyed his radio. “Unit 3, this is Reddick. We’re checking a sublevel at our location. Stand by for support.” 

Static answered back. 

Not interference. Just… flat. 

Paul repeated himself, with the same result. He frowned at the radio, gave it a tap and a shake. 

“Probably the building.” 

“Probably,” I echoed. ""We need to go down though. We don't want them to get away from us."" 

I clicked on my light and we started down. 

The air grew cooler with each step, heavier somehow. The smell changed too, less dust, more damp concrete and old wiring. 

We reached the bottom. The stairwell opened into a wide concrete corridor. A heavy steel door stood open. 

The corridors beneath the building were old, utilitarian arteries of the city. Concrete walls stained by decades of moisture. Pipes ran along the ceiling in parallel lines, some wrapped in insulation, others bare and sweating. Thick cables were bolted into brackets, disappearing into the walls toward neighboring structures. 

It wasn’t quiet down here. 

Water moved through pipes beyond the walls. Somewhere ahead, something dripped, slow and rhythmic drops. Our footsteps echoed just enough to give the space shape. Old warning signs clung crookedly to the concrete: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, HIGH VOLTAGE, NO ADMITTANCE. 

Paul walked a step ahead of me, flashlight cutting through the dim, catching junction boxes and faded stenciled numbers on the walls. 

“This place must tie into the whole block,” he said. “Utility backbone for all the structures.” 

“That’d explain the maze.” I replied. 

We rounded a corner and stepped into the main service tunnel. It was wider than the others, and the ceiling raised up several feet. Side corridors branched off at regular intervals, dark gaps leading to unknown places. Small light fixtures buzzed faintly in a line on the wall. Enough to see, but left blankets of shadow where the light faded. 

""Stay close."" I said in a low voice. 

""Roger that."" Paul responded as he shuffled closer to me. 

Then we crossed the threshold. 

The sound stopped. 

Not faded. Not dampened. Just gone.
The hum of the pipes vanished mid-breath. The drip ahead of us cut off like a switch had been thrown. Even our footsteps changed. They were muted, wrong, like they were being absorbed before they could exist. 

I stopped without meaning to. 

Paul did too. 

The sudden change was a shock but I couldn't put my finger on why my senses recognized it. 

All I could hear was my own breathing. Too loud. Too close. Paul’s came through beside me, muffled. 

“This isn’t...” he started, then stopped. 

Our voices didn’t carry. They didn’t bounce. They just… Existed, briefly, and died. 

The hair raised on my arm and my heart started racing. I finally realized what this was. 

""Back to back, now!"" I barked 

Paul landed squarely against my back and we drew our firearms. 

""What is this?"" He asked, a ring of fear in his voice. ""What's wrong with the sound?"" 

""This is what happened right before..."" My thoughts caught up with my mouth. ""All of them."" 

The beams of our flashlights swept the tunnel, stretching as far as they could before being swallowed by darkness on both ends. No movement. No sound. 

Every instinct I had screamed that we were being watched. 

Something moved. A shuffling noise. 

It came faster. 

Paul shouted. His voice sharp and panicked. 

The thing leapt out of a side tunnel in a blur of motion, four limbs and fast. It went for Paul’s chest and missed by inches, its momentum carrying it past him. A claw caught his side instead. 

Paul went down hard on his knee, gasping. 

I fired two shots after it. 

The gunshot sounded wrong too, flat and muted, like it had been wrapped in cloth. The flashes lit the tunnel in harsh white for two brief seconds. The thing recoiled, not injured, just surprised, then vanished back into another side corridor with a skittering retreat that made no sound at all. 

“Paul!” I grabbed him, hauling him upright. 

“I’m hit,” He said through clenched teeth. “Not bad... I think.” 

I didn’t wait to find out. 

“We’re moving,” I said. “Now.” 

We headed for the main service entrance behind us, weapons up, lights sweeping. Every side tunnel felt like an open threat. 

The thing kept pace with us. 

Not behind, but flanking the sides.
A shadow would flicker in the corner of my eye. Then nothing. 

It was stalking us. 

And Paul was bleeding. 

We stayed in motion. 

That was the only thing keeping the panic at bay. 

Ahead of us I could faintly make out the exit under a dim light. The tunnel seemed to stretch on forever, the silence pressed in harder the longer we walked. Every sound we made was wrong. our breathing muted, our steps dull and swallowed before they could travel. 

There was only one sound that didn’t belong to us. 

It came and went, just at the edge of the shadows. A scrape. Something brushing concrete. 

Paul was still upright, still pushing forward, but his steps had shortened. He favored his left side now, one hand pressed tight against his ribs. I stayed close, matching his pace, light sweeping the tunnel entries as we passed them. 

“It’s herding us.” he muttered. 

I didn’t argue. 

The sound came closer. 

This time we saw it. 

The darkness beside us peeled open, and the thing launched itself from the corridor, all limbs and momentum. Paul reacted on instinct, spinning and firing three quick shots. The muzzle flashes lit the tunnel in violent bursts. White, then black, then white again. 

All three missed 

The creature twisted mid-jump. 

I dodged aside almost tripping myself, felt air move as it sailed past, close enough that I caught a glimpse of its shape: Angled head full of teeth, a mix of flesh and fur with large claws. I fired as I turned, arm snapping up in sync. 

The shot landed. 

This time the sound was different. 

It let out a sharp, broken noise that made my ears ache, something like a shriek with feedback. It hit the far wall, rebounded and vanished into the shadows again. 

Paul laughed once, breathless and disbelieving. “You hit it.” 

The sound didn’t follow us right away this time. 

But Paul slowed. 

Noticeably now. 

We were close enough to the exit that the light was stronger, spilling into the tunnel in a dull yellow wash. I could finally see his hand when he pulled it away from his side.
It was soaked. 

“Paul..."" I said.
He took two more steps, then stopped. Leaned heavily against the wall. 

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “That’s… worse than I thought.” 

Blood pooled on his shirt and down his belt, dark and spreading. I knelt, pressed my hands against the wound without really thinking. It stained my fingers immediately. 

“Stay with me,” I said. “We’re almost out.” 

He shook his head. 

“I really hit the wall this time, didn't I?” He said with a pained laugh. 

I looked toward the exit, then back at him. 

“Don’t talk like that.” I said. 

“The radio won’t work down here,” he replied. Calm. Too calm. “You know that. You need to get topside. Call it in.” 

“I’m not leaving you.” 

He grabbed my wrist, slick with his blood. His grip was still strong. 

“Derrick,” he said. “If you stay, we both die.” 

The scraping sound came again. Distant, but near enough. 

Paul met my eyes. “Go.” 

""No!"" I nearly shouted in his face. ""I'm not losing you too."" 

I braced up under his good side, he groaned and gritted his teeth as I hoisted him up and practically carried him forward and up the stairs, his feet stumbling and grunting in pain alongside me. 

The moment we crossed the threshold, the noise of the city rushed back in. Traffic, wind, a distant car horn. It felt obscene after the silence. I set Paul down quickly but gently and stepped forward, scanning the area left and right. Clear. 

The radio crackled in my hand. 

“Officer down, I repeat, officer down. Westside commercial block, Service entrance. Need medic and backup ASAP!” 

My hands were still wet. 

For just a second, the sounds around me faltered. Like someone accidently paused a video, then pushed play again. I turned back and my heart dropped through my stomach instantly. 

Paul was gone. The door hung open. 

""No..."" I barely breathed and ran back inside. 

The tunnel was loud again. Pipes hummed. Water dripped. Sound returned like nothing had ever happened.

But Paul was nowhere. 

Only streaks of blood remained, smeared across the concrete, dragged away toward the far end of the main tunnel. Long, uneven marks that disappeared into the dark. 

I shouldn’t have gone back in. 

I knew that even as I raised the flashlight and revolver, even as my legs carried me forward before my mind could catch up. Training said wait. Survival said run. But I went in anyway. 

The beam cut through the tunnel in long, trembling strokes. Pipes. Walls. The same branching corridors. Everything had returned. Water dripping. A distant fan rattling. The low hum of power somewhere deeper in the structure. 

Normal. 

Wrongly normal. 

I followed the blood. 

It led me halfway down the service tunnel before it simply… stopped. No pooling. No smear fading out. No turn into a side corridor. 

Just an abrupt end, like someone had lifted him straight up and carried him through the concrete itself. 

I stood there for a long time, staring at the last dark mark on the floor, waiting for something, anything, to explain it. 

Nothing. 

The tunnel stayed quiet. Empty. Whatever had been down there was gone. 

I backed away slowly, every step heavier than the last, until I turned and made my way out. When I emerged into the open air, the afternoon light felt unreal, washed pale by cloud cover and exhaustion. 

My legs gave out. 

I slumped against the concrete wall beside the access door, revolver still in my hand, flashlight dangling uselessly at my side, still on. The adrenaline drained all at once, leaving my nerves trembling. 

Sirens wailed in the distance. 

They were coming fast. But all too late. 

I made my statements. They listened, blankly and unbelieving. Someone brought me my hat... I didn't even realize It had fallen off. 

Following that evening I was put on leave. They said take time to rest and recuperate. Leave didn’t feel like rest. 

It felt like being removed from the board mid-game and told to wait while the pieces kept moving. 

I made coffee out of habit. One cup. Always one. It went cold every time. I’d sit at the table, stare into it like something might pop out, then forget it was there entirely. 

The apartment was too quiet, even with the TV on. By the third day, I stopped pretending to rest and stayed up late with the lights on. All of them, every room. 

I was called back into the office. The station smelled the same as it always had. Old brick, stale coffee, disinfectant that never quite masked either. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, bright and unforgiving. It should have felt welcoming, but instead the atmosphere seemed to reject my presence. 

I sat at a table that wasn’t meant for the innocent. No files. No fluff. Just a recorder, a legal pad, and two people who already knew the version of the story that made sense to them. 

Internal Affairs didn’t raise their voices. 

They didn’t have to. 

They asked about the radio station. Why we’d entered without a warrant. Why there was no request logged, no backup on site when things went bad. They asked about Paul. How close we were, how long we’d worked together. They asked about Ethan. 

Personal connections. 

Judgment calls. 

A pattern. 

I answered everything straight. Calm. Professional. Stuck to the facts. I tried to convince them of the leads, the clues, the... Thing...  But every answer seemed to circle the same drain. No physical evidence, no witnesses, an officer lost with no body, no suspect. 

Just a story. 

When they were done, one of them folded his hands and spoke carefully, like the words had edges. 

""Pending review, you’re suspended. Badge and firearm turned in. We’ll be recommending further action once the board evaluates..."" 

Fired. 

They didn’t say it, but the intent was there. 

I nodded. What else could I do? 

My phone buzzed while I stood outside the station, staring at the steps I've walked up and down for years. 

It was Gabs. 

""I heard what happened.
I’m really sorry, Derrick. This isn’t right.
You didn’t imagine this. You’re the best detective we’ve got, and everyone in the department knows it.
I think it’ll work out. I really do.
If you need anything… I’m here."" 

I read it twice. Her words should have felt comforting, but I felt nothing. 

I tried to type something. Then deleted it. 

The pub was a few blocks from home. Close enough to walk. Far enough to feel like leaving something behind. Same place I’d gone after long shifts, back when a bad day meant paperwork and not an empty tunnel where a man had been standing moments before. 

I took my usual seat at the bar. 

“Scotch, on the rocks. Make it a double."" I said. 

The bartender nodded. Rocks. No questions. He slid it over and moved on like he knew this was another one of those nights. 

I didn’t drink right away. Just rested my hands on the glass, feeling the cold seep into my palms. The place was alive in a way my apartment wasn’t. Low voices. Laughter from the corners. Glasses clinking. A game murmuring from a TV I wasn’t watching. 

Sound behaving the way it should. 

I was halfway through the glass when someone sat down beside me. 

Didn’t announce himself. Didn’t crowd me. Just close enough to share the bar’s narrow strip of space. 

“Whiskey, please,” he said. “Neat.” 

The bartender didn’t hesitate and slid his glass over. 

I turned my head just slightly. 

He looked ordinary. Not forgettable, just unremarkable in a way that felt deliberate. Calm posture. Hands steady. The kind of presence that didn’t attract attention. 

“So, here to numb the pain or... Drown out the silence?” he asked. 

He rolled the liquid around in his glass then took a noisy sip. 

My absent mind froze on that last word. 

“You followed the right trail,” he said. “Most people don’t.” 

I shifted uncomfortably on the stool. ""Who are you..?"" 

He ignored me. “What happened out there was real,” he said. “Your instincts weren’t off. The problem is the answers don’t fit cleanly into a who.” 

Or a what. 

He didn’t say it, but the thought was there. 

“I just wanted you to know you weren’t chasing ghosts."" He went on. ""You were just chasing something people don’t know is there.” 

He reached into his jacket and set a card on the bar between us. 

Blank except for an address. No fancy logo and title. No explanation. 

“If you want the parts you’re missing,” he said, standing, “Here is where to find them.” 

He paused, then added, quieter: “Or you can finish the drink and pretend the world still works the way it did last week. No one would blame you.” 

He left without waiting for an answer. 

The bar filled the space again. Laughter. Glass. Voices overlapping just enough to blur. 

The card stayed where it was. 

I stayed late into the night. The glass sweated onto the bar long after the ice had melted away. The scotch thinned out, watered down and lukewarm but I kept my hand around it anyway. The bar emptied in stages. Voices faded. Chairs went upside down on tables one by one. 

At some point the TV went dark. 

I became aware of how quiet it had gotten only when the bartender said he was locking up and it was time to head home. 

The card was still where he’d left it. I hadn’t moved it. When I finally picked it up, it felt heavier than it should have. 

I knocked back what was left of the drink. It barely burned. 

Outside, the night air was cool and sharp. I stood there for a moment, the bar’s door closing softly behind me, car horns distant somewhere across the city. 

For the first time since the tunnel, since the silence, I wasn’t running on instinct or reaction. 

I had a direction. 

Whoever was watching... they had answers. Real ones. Not guesses. Not theories pinned to corkboard. 

I looked at the card once more and slipped it into my coat pocket. 

I pulled out my phone. 12:34 am. Late but just maybe.. 

I dialed Gabriella. It rang and went to voicemail. 

""Hey Gabs,"" I said a little more cheerful than I felt. ""Thanks for the message the other day. I really appreciated it."" 

I paused 

""Listen... I'm not done with this. Not yet. I can't..  Not after Paul..."" I paused, ""Maybe sometime I'll have something more I can bring you. Maybe just a coffee with that apple pastry you like. But don't worry about me.. I'll be fine.. I'm still on the hunt.""

Warning: >!Blood!<

I pulled up to the curb outside the station just as Paul stepped through the doors, jacket slung over his arm. He paused when he saw me, then grinned. 

“My favorite chauffeur.” He joked as he climbed in. 

“Where to?” I replied 

He shut the door and pulled his phone out, turning it toward me as I eased back into traffic. “Alright. Gab's team got this address from the trace.” The map loaded slowly, then settled. 

“West side,” He said. “Commercial zoning mostly. Offices, storage, a couple light industrial spots. Some residential pockets mixed in.” 

I glanced at the screen, committing the route to memory. “Could be anything, then.” 

“Exactly,” Paul said. “Businesses. Rentals. 
Someone’s old office space.” 

Or a house that doesn’t get visitors, I thought, but didn’t say. 

We headed out of downtown, the buildings thinning and spreading apart as we moved west. Traffic eased. The city felt looser here, less watched. 

I caught him up on Ethan's map as I steered us through the turns. 

“Same dead ends,” I said. “Same places where things stop making sense.” 

“That’s enough to get someone’s attention,” he said. “Whoever is behind this.” 

I nodded in agreement. 

“Whoever they are, they were watching him for a while. That takes planning. Doesn’t feel random.” 

“No,” I said. “It doesn’t.” 

As we crossed deeper into the west side, the buildings grew taller, more utilitarian. Parking garages and old businesses stacked concrete on concrete. 

Paul grabbed the radio. “Dispatch, this is Reddick. I’m requesting any available unit nearby this address to keep a tight patrol and standby for assistance. Possible suspect contact."" 

The acknowledgment came quickly. 

""Just in case."" He added. 

""Good call."" I said. 

We turned down a narrower street, flanked by aging office buildings and fenced lots. 

The address led us farther than I expected, into a stretch that felt barely used and forgotten. I slowed the car as we approached the destination. 

“Well,” he said, brow furrowing, “That’s not a house.” 

The building sat back off to the side. Faded lettering was painted high on the brick. A radio call sign and a channel number, sun-bleached but still legible. Temporary fencing surrounded the property, sections bowed and patched like no one had bothered to finish the job. Windows were dark. Some boarded. Some intact. 

“This place still active?” Paul asked. 

“Doesn’t look like it.” I said. 

“Then why would anything trace here?” 

We parked a short distance away, both of us sitting still for a moment.This wasn’t what either of us had pictured when we punched in the address. 

Paul exhaled slowly. “Alright. That changes things a bit.” 

I adjusted the brim of my hat as we stepped out, the sound of the car door closing echoed once. We stood there for a moment, studying the building, the fence, the other buildings. The lot had several, some two stories like the old radio station, and a parking garage off to the corner. At the far end of the lot looked what appeared to be a door that led down underground. Utility closet perhaps. 

I rubbed my fingers over the bristles of my beard. Whatever had brought us here wasn’t obvious. 

We checked our gear before we left the car, Paul clipping the radio to his belt and tossing his jacket onto the seat. I adjusted my belt too where my short-barreled revolver was holstered, then rolled up the cuffs of my button up shirt. 

We crossed through the gap in the construction fence, our shoes crunching on gravel and old leaves that had collected where no one bothered to sweep anymore. Orange plastic fluttered weakly against a bent post, tapping in the breeze like it was trying to get our attention and failing. 

Paul eyed the front door as we approached. “Place looks like it’s been waiting for a wellness check.” 

I huffed a quiet chuckle.
“Let’s hope it answers better than most.” 

The door wasn’t locked. 

That stopped us both for half a beat.
Paul looked at the handle, then at me. 
“That’s either convenient… or a problem.” 

“Only one way to find out,” I said. 

I pushed the door open. 

The air inside was stale but not rotten. Old dust. Dry carpet. The faint musky smell you get from an aging building that hasn't seen use in a long time. Our footsteps echoed briefly down a hallway that opened up into what had once been the main floor.
The first level looked exactly like what it was: a radio station that had shut its doors mid-life and never came back. Cubicles with sun-faded dividers. A reception desk with a cracked laminate top. Someone had left a coffee mug on a filing cabinet beside a desk. A baseball cap hung on the corner of a chair like its owner had stepped away for a smoke and never returned. 

“Knock knock.” Paul muttered. “Looks like nobody's home.” 

“Yeah,” I said, “Abandoned in time.” 

We moved room to room. Old broadcast offices. A small break area with a dead fridge. Nothing disturbed. Nothing spoke to being currently occupied. If someone had packed up, they’d done it a long time ago. 

Then we found the elevator. 

Paul pressed the call button instinctively. 

Nothing happened. The indicator above the door was dark. 

“Figures,” he said. “Stairs it is.” 

The stairwell smelled different. Colder. Concrete and dust. Our steps echoed tighter here, the sound snapping back quicker, more contained. The further up we went, the less the building felt like a workplace and more like a shell.
The second floor doors opened onto something that didn’t match the first. 

Most of the space was empty. 

Not stripped violently. Just… cleared. No desks. No chairs. No personal clutter. The walls were bare except for faint rectangles where furnishings had once rested. Even the floor seemed unremarkable, just the same carpet as the bottom floor. 

Paul slowed. “Do you hear that.” 

“Yeah,” I said. 

We followed the hum. 

It was faint, easy to miss at first. A low electrical presence, steady and patient. It led us toward the far end of the floor, where the main broadcast room had been. 

The original radio hardware was still there, mixing boards, racks of analog gear, dials yellowed with age. It had been cleaned, dusted, maintained. Cables ran where they should. Indicator lights blinked softly. Someone had brought it back online. 

And then there was the new stuff.
Industrial computer towers. Rack-mounted units stacked cleanly along the wall. Thick cables fed into them, bundled and labeled, disappearing into conduits that hadn’t existed in the station’s original design. Small lights glowed faintly. No branding. Just matte metal cases with cooling fans whispering steadily. 

This wasn’t hobbyist gear. 

“That doesn’t belong here.” I said quietly. 

“No,” Paul agreed. “And it’s not cheap.” 

I stepped closer, careful not to touch anything yet. The contrast was wrong. Old broadcast equipment kept alive, cables re-run to support something newer. 

Paul scanned the room, hand resting near his sidearm. “You still thinking kidnapping?” 

I hesitated. 

“I think...” I said slowly, “Someone’s been involved a lot longer than we have.” 

The hum continued, steady and unconcerned. 

Whatever this place was doing, it wasn’t abandoned. 

A laptop sat at the edge of the table near the humming tower like it had been forgotten.
Not tucked away. Not secured. Just there. Closed, thin layer of dust clinging to the lid. Not enough to suggest years. Weeks, maybe. A month at most. 

“That’s odd,” Paul said. “You don’t just leave something like that.” 

“No,” I said. “You leave it if you expect to come back.” 

I lifted the lid. 

The screen came alive instantly. No boot sequence. No login screen. Whatever had been running hadn’t stopped when the laptop was closed. It had just... waited. A dark interface blinked once and settled into place, lines of text and overlayed graphics filling the display. 

Paul let out a quiet whistle. “Still powered after sitting around this long.” 

The power cable hung off the side of the thin device and ran off into the mass of cables at the floor, plugged in somewhere. 

The first window was simple. Clean. No names. No identifiers. Just timestamps and coordinate data noted down in neat columns. Longitude. Latitude. Altitude. Movement vectors. 

“This looks like GPS tracking.” Paul said, leaning closer. 

“Yeah,” I replied. “But anonymous. No personal data.” 

No phone numbers. No carrier data. Just dots on a map. 

I scrolled. 

One highlighted coordinate made my hand pause. 

Then another. 

Then another. 

“Paul."" I said quietly. 

He followed my finger. 

The old quarry. 

The mountain pass. 

Beneath them dozens of time stamps with coordinates. The entries were brief. Minutes. Seconds. Others lingered for hours. The system didn’t care who they were. Only where they’d been. How long they stayed. How close they got. 

“This isn’t about people,” I said slowly. “It’s proximity. How close they were to.. something.” 

I clicked into another directory. The interface changed. The screen dimmed, replaced by a grid. Faint, translucent lines dividing the area into large square quadrants. The background was dark, grayed out, with pulses of light blooming at different quadrants. 

Small readouts updated in real time. 

Resonance variance.
Harmonic deviation.
Signal coherence: unstable. 

Paul frowned. “What the hell does that mean?” 

“I don’t know,” I said honestly. “But it’s not all GPS data.” 

There were waveforms. Frequencies. Whatever this was “listening” to we didn't have a clue. 

One quadrant pulsed brighter than the rest. 

The forest. 

The same region we’d been circling for years. 

Then Paul stiffened. 

“Derrick.” 

Another point lit up. 

Closer. 

Much closer. 

I leaned in, reading the coordinate overlay.
It was nearly on top of us. But its elevation was underground? 

My eyes dropped to the timestamp. 

Ten minutes ago. 

I felt my stomach tighten. 

“That’s when we entered the building."" Paul said. 

Neither of us spoke for a moment. 

The equipment hummed around us, steady and patient. The building didn’t creak. The air didn’t shift. Nothing obvious had changed. 

And yet... 

Paul straightened, hand moving unconsciously toward his weapon. 

We listened. 

The hum was still there. 

But the room felt… Ominous. 

The laptop chimed softly. 

Another update. 

The underground quadrant pulsed brighter.
Somewhere beneath our feet, something had just moved. 

Paul turned away from the laptop and scanned the room, eyes tracking the walls, the ceiling, the corners where old cables vanished into conduit. 

“Do radio stations usually have sub levels?” he asked. “Basement storage?” 

“Maintenance tunnels,” I added. “For the utilities. Especially with older infrastructures.” 

I closed the laptop but didn’t unplug it. Something about leaving it running felt… Necessary. 

We made our way back down the stairs and found the sub level access tucked into a corner. The door opened with a dry scrape of metal against concrete. 

Cold air spilled out. 

Not a draft exactly. More like the building exhaled. A narrow hallway lead to another doorframe with no door. Beyond the threshold, a stairwell descended into shadows. Concrete steps, narrow and steep, with a handrail bolted directly into the wall. Old light fixtures ran along the ceiling. We flipped the switch, the third one was dark. One of the working ones flickered. 

Paul clicked on his flashlight. The beam cut cleanly down the stairwell, stopping short of the bottom. 

“Tunnel access,” he said. “Or maybe a dungeon.” 

I smirked despite the eeriness. He smirked back, brief and tight. 

“Call it in?” he asked. 

I hesitated. 

If this was a kidnapping, we were about to step onto someone else’s turf. If it wasn’t… I wasn’t sure what we were walking into. 

“Yeah, just in case.” I said. 

Paul nodded and keyed his radio. “Unit 3, this is Reddick. We’re checking a sublevel at our location. Stand by for support.” 

Static answered back. 

Not interference. Just… flat. 

Paul repeated himself, with the same result. He frowned at the radio, gave it a tap and a shake. 

“Probably the building.” 

“Probably,” I echoed. ""We need to go down though. We don't want them to get away from us."" 

I clicked on my light and we started down. 

The air grew cooler with each step, heavier somehow. The smell changed too, less dust, more damp concrete and old wiring. 

We reached the bottom. The stairwell opened into a wide concrete corridor. A heavy steel door stood open. 

The corridors beneath the building were old, utilitarian arteries of the city. Concrete walls stained by decades of moisture. Pipes ran along the ceiling in parallel lines, some wrapped in insulation, others bare and sweating. Thick cables were bolted into brackets, disappearing into the walls toward neighboring structures. 

It wasn’t quiet down here. 

Water moved through pipes beyond the walls. Somewhere ahead, something dripped, slow and rhythmic drops. Our footsteps echoed just enough to give the space shape. Old warning signs clung crookedly to the concrete: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, HIGH VOLTAGE, NO ADMITTANCE. 

Paul walked a step ahead of me, flashlight cutting through the dim, catching junction boxes and faded stenciled numbers on the walls. 

“This place must tie into the whole block,” he said. “Utility backbone for all the structures.” 

“That’d explain the maze.” I replied. 

We rounded a corner and stepped into the main service tunnel. It was wider than the others, and the ceiling raised up several feet. Side corridors branched off at regular intervals, dark gaps leading to unknown places. Small light fixtures buzzed faintly in a line on the wall. Enough to see, but left blankets of shadow where the light faded. 

""Stay close."" I said in a low voice. 

""Roger that."" Paul responded as he shuffled closer to me. 

Then we crossed the threshold. 

The sound stopped. 

Not faded. Not dampened. Just gone.
The hum of the pipes vanished mid-breath. The drip ahead of us cut off like a switch had been thrown. Even our footsteps changed. They were muted, wrong, like they were being absorbed before they could exist. 

I stopped without meaning to. 

Paul did too. 

The sudden change was a shock but I couldn't put my finger on why my senses recognized it. 

All I could hear was my own breathing. Too loud. Too close. Paul’s came through beside me, muffled. 

“This isn’t...” he started, then stopped. 

Our voices didn’t carry. They didn’t bounce. They just… Existed, briefly, and died. 

The hair raised on my arm and my heart started racing. I finally realized what this was. 

""Back to back, now!"" I barked 

Paul landed squarely against my back and we drew our firearms. 

""What is this?"" He asked, a ring of fear in his voice. ""What's wrong with the sound?"" 

""This is what happened right before..."" My thoughts caught up with my mouth. ""All of them."" 

The beams of our flashlights swept the tunnel, stretching as far as they could before being swallowed by darkness on both ends. No movement. No sound. 

Every instinct I had screamed that we were being watched. 

Something moved. A shuffling noise. 

It came faster. 

Paul shouted. His voice sharp and panicked. 

The thing leapt out of a side tunnel in a blur of motion, four limbs and fast. It went for Paul’s chest and missed by inches, its momentum carrying it past him. A claw caught his side instead. 

Paul went down hard on his knee, gasping. 

I fired two shots after it. 

The gunshot sounded wrong too, flat and muted, like it had been wrapped in cloth. The flashes lit the tunnel in harsh white for two brief seconds. The thing recoiled, not injured, just surprised, then vanished back into another side corridor with a skittering retreat that made no sound at all. 

“Paul!” I grabbed him, hauling him upright. 

“I’m hit,” He said through clenched teeth. “Not bad... I think.” 

I didn’t wait to find out. 

“We’re moving,” I said. “Now.” 

We headed for the main service entrance behind us, weapons up, lights sweeping. Every side tunnel felt like an open threat. 

The thing kept pace with us. 

Not behind, but flanking the sides.
A shadow would flicker in the corner of my eye. Then nothing. 

It was stalking us. 

And Paul was bleeding. 

We stayed in motion. 

That was the only thing keeping the panic at bay. 

Ahead of us I could faintly make out the exit under a dim light. The tunnel seemed to stretch on forever, the silence pressed in harder the longer we walked. Every sound we made was wrong. our breathing muted, our steps dull and swallowed before they could travel. 

There was only one sound that didn’t belong to us. 

It came and went, just at the edge of the shadows. A scrape. Something brushing concrete. 

Paul was still upright, still pushing forward, but his steps had shortened. He favored his left side now, one hand pressed tight against his ribs. I stayed close, matching his pace, light sweeping the tunnel entries as we passed them. 

“It’s herding us.” he muttered. 

I didn’t argue. 

The sound came closer. 

This time we saw it. 

The darkness beside us peeled open, and the thing launched itself from the corridor, all limbs and momentum. Paul reacted on instinct, spinning and firing three quick shots. The muzzle flashes lit the tunnel in violent bursts. White, then black, then white again. 

All three missed 

The creature twisted mid-jump. 

I dodged aside almost tripping myself, felt air move as it sailed past, close enough that I caught a glimpse of its shape: Angled head full of teeth, a mix of flesh and fur with large claws. I fired as I turned, arm snapping up in sync. 

The shot landed. 

This time the sound was different. 

It let out a sharp, broken noise that made my ears ache, something like a shriek with feedback. It hit the far wall, rebounded and vanished into the shadows again. 

Paul laughed once, breathless and disbelieving. “You hit it.” 

The sound didn’t follow us right away this time. 

But Paul slowed. 

Noticeably now. 

We were close enough to the exit that the light was stronger, spilling into the tunnel in a dull yellow wash. I could finally see his hand when he pulled it away from his side.
It was soaked. 

“Paul..."" I said.
He took two more steps, then stopped. Leaned heavily against the wall. 

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “That’s… worse than I thought.” 

Blood pooled on his shirt and down his belt, dark and spreading. I knelt, pressed my hands against the wound without really thinking. It stained my fingers immediately. 

“Stay with me,” I said. “We’re almost out.” 

He shook his head. 

“I really hit the wall this time, didn't I?” He said with a pained laugh. 

I looked toward the exit, then back at him. 

“Don’t talk like that.” I said. 

“The radio won’t work down here,” he replied. Calm. Too calm. “You know that. You need to get topside. Call it in.” 

“I’m not leaving you.” 

He grabbed my wrist, slick with his blood. His grip was still strong. 

“Derrick,” he said. “If you stay, we both die.” 

The scraping sound came again. Distant, but near enough. 

Paul met my eyes. “Go.” 

""No!"" I nearly shouted in his face. ""I'm not losing you too."" 

I braced up under his good side, he groaned and gritted his teeth as I hoisted him up and practically carried him forward and up the stairs, his feet stumbling and grunting in pain alongside me. 

The moment we crossed the threshold, the noise of the city rushed back in. Traffic, wind, a distant car horn. It felt obscene after the silence. I set Paul down quickly but gently and stepped forward, scanning the area left and right. Clear. 

The radio crackled in my hand. 

“Officer down, I repeat, officer down. Westside commercial block, Service entrance. Need medic and backup ASAP!” 

My hands were still wet. 

For just a second, the sounds around me faltered. Like someone accidently paused a video, then pushed play again. I turned back and my heart dropped through my stomach instantly. 

Paul was gone. The door hung open. 

""No..."" I barely breathed and ran back inside. 

The tunnel was loud again. Pipes hummed. Water dripped. Sound returned like nothing had ever happened.

But Paul was nowhere. 

Only streaks of blood remained, smeared across the concrete, dragged away toward the far end of the main tunnel. Long, uneven marks that disappeared into the dark. 

I shouldn’t have gone back in. 

I knew that even as I raised the flashlight and revolver, even as my legs carried me forward before my mind could catch up. Training said wait. Survival said run. But I went in anyway. 

The beam cut through the tunnel in long, trembling strokes. Pipes. Walls. The same branching corridors. Everything had returned. Water dripping. A distant fan rattling. The low hum of power somewhere deeper in the structure. 

Normal. 

Wrongly normal. 

I followed the blood. 

It led me halfway down the service tunnel before it simply… stopped. No pooling. No smear fading out. No turn into a side corridor. 

Just an abrupt end, like someone had lifted him straight up and carried him through the concrete itself. 

I stood there for a long time, staring at the last dark mark on the floor, waiting for something, anything, to explain it. 

Nothing. 

The tunnel stayed quiet. Empty. Whatever had been down there was gone. 

I backed away slowly, every step heavier than the last, until I turned and made my way out. When I emerged into the open air, the afternoon light felt unreal, washed pale by cloud cover and exhaustion. 

My legs gave out. 

I slumped against the concrete wall beside the access door, revolver still in my hand, flashlight dangling uselessly at my side, still on. The adrenaline drained all at once, leaving my nerves trembling. 

Sirens wailed in the distance. 

They were coming fast. But all too late. 

I made my statements. They listened, blankly and unbelieving. Someone brought me my hat... I didn't even realize It had fallen off. 

Following that evening I was put on leave. They said take time to rest and recuperate. Leave didn’t feel like rest. 

It felt like being removed from the board mid-game and told to wait while the pieces kept moving. 

I made coffee out of habit. One cup. Always one. It went cold every time. I’d sit at the table, stare into it like something might pop out, then forget it was there entirely. 

The apartment was too quiet, even with the TV on. By the third day, I stopped pretending to rest and stayed up late with the lights on. All of them, every room. 

I was called back into the office. The station smelled the same as it always had. Old brick, stale coffee, disinfectant that never quite masked either. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, bright and unforgiving. It should have felt welcoming, but instead the atmosphere seemed to reject my presence. 

I sat at a table that wasn’t meant for the innocent. No files. No fluff. Just a recorder, a legal pad, and two people who already knew the version of the story that made sense to them. 

Internal Affairs didn’t raise their voices. 

They didn’t have to. 

They asked about the radio station. Why we’d entered without a warrant. Why there was no request logged, no backup on site when things went bad. They asked about Paul. How close we were, how long we’d worked together. They asked about Ethan. 

Personal connections. 

Judgment calls. 

A pattern. 

I answered everything straight. Calm. Professional. Stuck to the facts. I tried to convince them of the leads, the clues, the... Thing...  But every answer seemed to circle the same drain. No physical evidence, no witnesses, an officer lost with no body, no suspect. 

Just a story. 

When they were done, one of them folded his hands and spoke carefully, like the words had edges. 

""Pending review, you’re suspended. Badge and firearm turned in. We’ll be recommending further action once the board evaluates..."" 

Fired. 

They didn’t say it, but the intent was there. 

I nodded. What else could I do? 

My phone buzzed while I stood outside the station, staring at the steps I've walked up and down for years. 

It was Gabs. 

""I heard what happened.
I’m really sorry, Derrick. This isn’t right.
You didn’t imagine this. You’re the best detective we’ve got, and everyone in the department knows it.
I think it’ll work out. I really do.
If you need anything… I’m here."" 

I read it twice. Her words should have felt comforting, but I felt nothing. 

I tried to type something. Then deleted it. 

The pub was a few blocks from home. Close enough to walk. Far enough to feel like leaving something behind. Same place I’d gone after long shifts, back when a bad day meant paperwork and not an empty tunnel where a man had been standing moments before. 

I took my usual seat at the bar. 

“Scotch, on the rocks. Make it a double."" I said. 

The bartender nodded. Rocks. No questions. He slid it over and moved on like he knew this was another one of those nights. 

I didn’t drink right away. Just rested my hands on the glass, feeling the cold seep into my palms. The place was alive in a way my apartment wasn’t. Low voices. Laughter from the corners. Glasses clinking. A game murmuring from a TV I wasn’t watching. 

Sound behaving the way it should. 

I was halfway through the glass when someone sat down beside me. 

Didn’t announce himself. Didn’t crowd me. Just close enough to share the bar’s narrow strip of space. 

“Whiskey, please,” he said. “Neat.” 

The bartender didn’t hesitate and slid his glass over. 

I turned my head just slightly. 

He looked ordinary. Not forgettable, just unremarkable in a way that felt deliberate. Calm posture. Hands steady. The kind of presence that didn’t attract attention. 

“So, here to numb the pain or... Drown out the silence?” he asked. 

He rolled the liquid around in his glass then took a noisy sip. 

My absent mind froze on that last word. 

“You followed the right trail,” he said. “Most people don’t.” 

I shifted uncomfortably on the stool. ""Who are you..?"" 

He ignored me. “What happened out there was real,” he said. “Your instincts weren’t off. The problem is the answers don’t fit cleanly into a who.” 

Or a what. 

He didn’t say it, but the thought was there. 

“I just wanted you to know you weren’t chasing ghosts."" He went on. ""You were just chasing something people don’t know is there.” 

He reached into his jacket and set a card on the bar between us. 

Blank except for an address. No fancy logo and title. No explanation. 

“If you want the parts you’re missing,” he said, standing, “Here is where to find them.” 

He paused, then added, quieter: “Or you can finish the drink and pretend the world still works the way it did last week. No one would blame you.” 

He left without waiting for an answer. 

The bar filled the space again. Laughter. Glass. Voices overlapping just enough to blur. 

The card stayed where it was. 

I stayed late into the night. The glass sweated onto the bar long after the ice had melted away. The scotch thinned out, watered down and lukewarm but I kept my hand around it anyway. The bar emptied in stages. Voices faded. Chairs went upside down on tables one by one. 

At some point the TV went dark. 

I became aware of how quiet it had gotten only when the bartender said he was locking up and it was time to head home. 

The card was still where he’d left it. I hadn’t moved it. When I finally picked it up, it felt heavier than it should have. 

I knocked back what was left of the drink. It barely burned. 

Outside, the night air was cool and sharp. I stood there for a moment, the bar’s door closing softly behind me, car horns distant somewhere across the city. 

For the first time since the tunnel, since the silence, I wasn’t running on instinct or reaction. 

I had a direction. 

Whoever was watching... they had answers. Real ones. Not guesses. Not theories pinned to corkboard. 

I looked at the card once more and slipped it into my coat pocket. 

I pulled out my phone. 12:34 am. Late but just maybe.. 

I dialed Gabriella. It rang and went to voicemail. 

""Hey Gabs,"" I said a little more cheerful than I felt. ""Thanks for the message the other day. I really appreciated it."" 

I paused 

""Listen... I'm not done with this. Not yet. I can't..  Not after Paul..."" I paused, ""Maybe sometime I'll have something more I can bring you. Maybe just a coffee with that apple pastry you like. But don't worry about me.. I'll be fine.. I'm still on the hunt.""

# BF6 MAX FPS + LOW STUTTER STARTING POINT GUIDE (Windows 11 + NVIDIA/AMD + In-Game)

**\*\*\*\*\* Second time trying to help the community. Please read carefully and don't assume I have everything perfect or that I'm 100% accurate. \*\*\*\*\***

**\*\*\*\*\* I don't need to know the formulas or calculations you use. STOP HERE. \*\*\*\*\***

STEAM USERS:

Most glitches and bad graphics were fixed after implementing all the optimizations below and re-downloading the game completely. I tried verifying game integrity many times, but it never worked, meaning the game never ran smoothly.

PS: I know is 100GB plus

This post is a STARTING POINT to get BF6 running correctly on most systems.

Goal:

* max FPS
* better 1% lows (less stutter)
* lower input delay
* fewer random issues

This will NOT magically make weak hardware run like a 4090.  
But it WILL fix the most common reasons BF6 runs bad even on good PCs.

NOTE:  
This guide is based on my personal hardware and testing: I have enough experience to understand your hardware better than you do.

* Intel CPU + NVIDIA RTX 3000 series (ROG Strix RTX 3080 10GB) But it is written to work for ANY CPU/GPU combo (Intel/AMD + NVIDIA/AMD).

# TLDR TOP 10 (FAST)

1- Use Fullscreen

* Fullscreen only (avoid Borderless if possible)
* Refresh rate = highest available
* V-Sync OFF

2- Cap FPS (smoothness + better aiming feel) \*Remember, you're going to cap whatever your FPS is. The table below is an example of how to do it.\*

* Cap FPS to (Monitor Hz - 3)
* 144Hz = 141 FPS
* 165Hz = 162 FPS
* 180Hz = 177 FPS
* 240Hz = 237 FPS

3- Turn on latency features (DON’T double-stack)

* NVIDIA: Reflex ON + Boost (in-game)
* AMD: Anti-Lag ON (Adrenalin)
* Do NOT force NVCP Low Latency Ultra if using Reflex

4- Disable FPS killers

* Shadows LOW
* Effects LOW
* Mesh LOW
* High Fidelity Object Amount LOW
* Ambient Occlusion OFF
* Screen Space Reflections OFF
* Ray Tracing OFF

5- Use DLSS/FSR/XeSS correctly

* 1080p: Quality or Balanced
* 1440p: Quality
* Don’t use Dynamic Resolution unless desperate

6- Textures must match VRAM (prevents stutter)

* 4GB VRAM: Textures LOW
* 6GB VRAM: Textures MEDIUM ( If MEDIUM is not available, set it to LOW )
* 8GB+ VRAM: Textures HIGH
* Texture Filtering HIGH (small FPS impact)

7- Turn OFF Windows capture junk

* Xbox Game Bar OFF (if you don’t use it)
* Background recording OFF (big stutter source)

8- Windows gaming settings

* Game Mode ON
* HAGS ON
* Power Mode Best Performance
* Fast Startup OFF

9- USB cleanup (common Battlefield stutter fix)

* Unplug extra USB hubs/devices
* Keep only hardware needed for game
* Disable USB Selective Suspend

10- BIOS USB S5 power (stability fix)  
If BIOS has:  
Disable USB power when PC is in S5 state

* Set to ENABLED Prevents devices staying half-powered when PC is OFF

# STEP 1 - WINDOWS 11 PERFORMANCE BASELINE

Power:

* Settings > System > Power > Power mode
* Best performance

Disable Fast Startup:

* Control Panel > Power Options > Choose what power buttons do
* Uncheck Turn on fast startup

Game Mode / GPU Scheduling:

* Settings > Gaming > Game Mode = ON
* Settings > System > Display > Graphics > Default graphics settings
* HAGS = ON
* Variable refresh rate = ON (if supported)

Startup cleanup:

* Task Manager > Startup apps
* Disable everything you don’t need while gaming

# STEP 2 - TELEMETRY / BACKGROUND APP CLEANUP (SAFE)

This reduces CPU spikes, background tasks, and random frametime hiccups.

* Disable background apps you don’t use
* Turn off notifications while gaming (Focus Assist)
* Avoid “optimizer” programs (many break Windows)

Keep it simple: clean startup, no junk running.

# STEP 3 - DISABLE CAPTURE + OVERLAYS (HUGE FOR STUTTER)

Xbox capture:

* Settings > Gaming > Captures
* Turn OFF background recording

Xbox Game Bar:

* Turn OFF if unused

Overlays to disable (best performance):

* Discord overlay OFF
* Steam overlay OFF
* NVIDIA overlay OFF (optional)
* AMD overlay OFF (optional)

More overlays = more stutter / input lag.

# STEP 4 - USB CLEANUP (UNDERRATED BUT HUGE)

USB devices can cause:

* micro stutter
* audio crackle
* random input delay
* CPU spikes (bad hubs)

Before BF6:  
Unplug everything not needed:

* USB hubs
* extra controllers
* phone charging cables
* extra DACs/audio devices
* capture cards (if unused)

Only keep:

* mouse
* keyboard
* headset OR DAC (one audio output)
* controller/Azeron if needed

Disable USB selective suspend:

* Control Panel > Power Options > Advanced settings
* USB settings > USB selective suspend = Disabled

Disable USB hub power saving:

* Device Manager > Universal Serial Bus controllers
* For each USB Root Hub/Generic USB Hub:
* Properties > Power Management
* Uncheck Allow the computer to turn off…

BIOS S5:  
If BIOS has:  
Disable USB power when PC is in S5 state

* ENABLED

# STEP 5 - WINDOWS NETWORK WORKAROUND (DNS + CHECK)

DNS will NOT lower in-game ping once you’re connected.  
But it CAN help with:

* faster matchmaking
* quicker server lookup
* fewer “connecting” delays
* more stable name resolution

Recommended DNS (Google):  
IPv4:

* [8.8.8.8](http://8.8.8.8)
* [8.8.4.4](http://8.8.4.4)

IPv6 (optional if working):

* 2001:4860:4860::8888
* 2001:4860:4860::8844

After setting DNS, verify it works:  
Open PowerShell or CMD:

nslookup [google.com](http://google.com)

Expected output:

* Server: [dns.google](http://dns.google)
* It returns both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses If you see DNS request timed out, your DNS setup is wrong or blocked.

# STEP 6 - NVIDIA CONTROL PANEL SETTINGS

NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D settings > Program Settings > BF6

Set:

* Power management mode = Prefer maximum performance
* Preferred refresh rate = Highest available
* Vertical sync = OFF
* Low Latency Mode = OFF (use Reflex in game)
* Max frame rate = OFF (cap in-game / RTSS)
* Texture filtering quality = High performance
* Threaded optimization = ON

If using G-SYNC:

* Enable G-SYNC
* NVCP V-Sync ON
* In-game V-Sync OFF
* Cap FPS to (Hz - 3)

# STEP 7 - AMD ADRENALIN SETTINGS

AMD Software > Gaming > BF6 profile

Set:

* Radeon Anti-Lag = ON
* Radeon Chill = OFF
* Enhanced Sync = OFF (optional)
* Wait for V-Sync = Always off

# STEP 8 - IN-GAME BF6 SETTINGS (BEST FPS SETTINGS)

Display:

* Fullscreen
* Refresh rate highest
* V-Sync OFF
* Motion blur OFF
* Film grain OFF
* Depth of field OFF
* Chromatic aberration OFF
* Lens distortion OFF

Latency:

* NVIDIA Reflex = ON + Boost (NVIDIA cards)
* AMD Anti-Lag = ON (driver)

FPS killers (set LOW/OFF):

* Shadows LOW
* Effects LOW
* Post processing LOW
* Mesh LOW
* High Fidelity Object Amount LOW
* Ambient Occlusion OFF
* Screen Space Reflections OFF
* Ray tracing OFF

Upscaling:

* use DLSS/FSR/XeSS (better than dynamic res)

# BEST BF6 PRESETS

1080p MAX FPS preset:

* Upscaling: DLSS/FSR/XeSS Quality or Balanced
* Textures: Medium (High if 8GB+ VRAM)
* Filtering: High
* Shadows/Effects/Post/Mesh/Object Amount: Low
* AO/SSR/RT: Off

1440p COMPETITIVE preset:

* Upscaling: DLSS/FSR/XeSS Quality
* Textures: High if 8GB+ VRAM
* Filtering: High
* Shadows/Effects/Post/Mesh/Object Amount: Low
* AO/SSR/RT: Off

# STUTTER FIX CHECKLIST (IF FPS IS HIGH BUT FEELS BAD)

Do these in order:

* cap FPS (Hz - 3)
* disable overlays
* disable background recording
* USB cleanup (remove hubs / extra devices)
* play 1-2 matches (shader cache rebuild)
* update chipset + GPU drivers
* test RAM stability (XMP can cause stutter)

Most BF6 problems are NOT the GPU.  
Usually it’s:  
USB hubs + overlays + capture + shader cache + unstable XMP.

I bet you'll have smooth gameplay after this, believe me. I just wish the game wasn't broken at all.

**Another trick to reduce background usage while gaming:**

* Click Start
* Type RUN and press Enter
* Type MSCONFIG and press Enter
* Go to the Services tab
* Check Hide all Microsoft services
* Then disable any services you don’t use while gaming (or don’t need at all) to reduce background resource usage

Important: Don’t disable random services if you don’t know what they do. If you’re unsure, disable only obvious non-gaming stuff

• Kevin was on a guided tour of the whole chocolate making process. In this time it was mentioned more than a handful of times that their process is bean to bar. It was also shown so. At the end of the tour, when there were options for questions, the only person who spoke was Kevin. He said that he understand how the cholocate is made, but he wanted to know it starts. They once again told him that its from bean to bar. And this didn’t sit well with him. He said yes yes and than added, but does the company get the chocolate from premade drops or do they grind pre bought chocolate bars. The guide was left speachless.

• My fiance was making coffee for her and her collegue. In walks Kevin. He asks what they are doing. She responds with making coffe for us and if he wants some. He says and adds that he will just watch her make coffee. He then stood there motionless, watching them make coffee.

This were just a few Kevinisms in his first week. But i was told there is many more.",48,1768134644.0,StoriesAboutKevin,4,0.98,False

I think my husband may be going through a midlife crisis. I just want to mention that I am Polish (34) and he is Irish (38), in case any cultural differences may play a role and we met each other in the UK. We have been together for 10 years. For the last couple of months, he has been snappy and angry with me. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I really adore him and treat him as my best friend. I always try to do nice things for him: I cook from scratch exclusively for him, I clean and iron his work clothes, I wear nice clothes and makeup, keep in shape, exercise, and keep my hair long because he likes it. We are intimate 4–5 times a week, I initiate often, and I try to meet all his needs. I am emotionally stable and try to be calm about all of this. He refuses to talk about what is wrong. Recently, he has developed an odd preoccupation with his height (he is 5'7""), which has suddenly become an issue for him and has issue about getting bald, but I tell him he is ,hot ' to me but he does not believe me. He has also accused me several times of going out to see other men, which is not true. I only went for coffee with a female friend and even told him to come with me if he didn’t believe me. I know this sounds gross to write, but he also gets random BJs from my initiative a few times a week, (I was told once this might be an issue not getting this but it was never a case) so that is not the issue either. He is only kind to me for 1–2 hours after this act, and then he becomes snappy again. I am not sure what else I can do. He refuses to see a psychologist, and our finances are fine we both work. Anything else? Thank you for any suggestions.",7,1768134610.0,UKrelationshipadvice,8,0.82,False

There has always been some tension about how much I sleep. In 2022, she switched to the weekend shift at her job and has to be at work at 6 am. It wasn't a big deal at first. We had opposite work schedules, but for the most part, we respected each other's sleep as we got ready in the morning. Then, a year or two ago, because we both worked Mondays, she started waking up with me at 4. We would both get up and eat breakfast together, and then I would leave. Then she started waking up at 4 am on Saturdays and Sundays too. I didn't think this would be a problem, but she started waking me up too. 

It started with her just turning on the bedroom light and watching a show while she ate breakfast and had coffee. It wasn't the end of the world, and I could usually sleep through it. Then she started waking me up to let the dogs out and feed them so she could focus on getting herself ready in the morning. I didn't really understand why it was necessary for me to do it because she was giving herself an hour and a half to get ready, but I didn't argue. I would get up, take care of the dogs, and go back to sleep. Some days, I would be so exhausted from the day before that I would sleep through her alarm and the lights and TV coming on, at which point she would get angry with me for making her have to take care of the dogs on top of her morning routine. Then she began demanding that I spend time with her in the morning. After she ate breakfast, she would jump into bed and start cuddling me. I'm not anti-cuddling my girlfriend, but when it's 4 in the morning on a Saturday, and you have fresh coffee breath suddenly invading your nostrils while you get shook around by someone trying to force you to wake up, it's hard not to have a negative reaction.

I've tried talking to her about it. I've expressed dozens of times in a dozen ways that I want to sleep on my days off, and that I don't want to be up at 4 am every day of the week. She always responds with one of a few responses. ""You can go back to bed after I leave."" ""I just want to spend time with you because we only get a couple of hours together at the end of the day."" ""Everyone is tired in the morning. You just have to deal with it."" Regardless of her response, every time I say something, it ends in a fight, with her saying she wishes I liked spending time with her and loved her more.

It's getting to the point where I'm considering ending the relationship because I'm constantly tired. ",79,1768134018.0,AmIOverreacting,87,0.96,False

Got it for like ten bucks at some random store, and I’ve had it for probably eight years now. Been through dishwashers, drops, even left it on a roof once when I forgot it in the car. Still works perfectly, no leaks, no weird smells, just solid.

Another one would be my basic nylon backpack. Paid maybe twenty bucks, used it daily through college, work, hikes, you name it. Zippers are still fine, straps haven’t frayed, and it’s surprisingly roomy. People always ask why I don’t get a fancy bag, and honestly, this thing has outlasted all of them.

I think the key is simple, sturdy materials and not overcomplicating things. Sometimes the cheap stuff is built to last because it’s designed to do one thing well, instead of trying to impress with features.
