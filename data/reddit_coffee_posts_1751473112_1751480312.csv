Lifelong hEDS person here- my symptoms worsened a lot over the last 2-3 years which led me to diagnosis and major life changes, in mid 20s now.

I used occasionally consume substances- namely alcohol, caffeine, weed. I can’t emphasize enough how little I used to have. 1-2 puffs of weed, 1-2 beers in a night, an iced coffee once in a while, you get the picture. 

But now, even a sip of coffee makes me feel like a scared prey animal, palpitations, etc. Weed makes me feel like I’m tweaking. And alcohol just makes me feel nauseous. This is new, within the past couple of years as my hypermobility stuff has worsened. I now am 100% sober and really miss the rare times I would partake. Does anyone else relate? No provider has ever given me an answer other than “it’s anxiety” type of thing. ",1,1751480147.0,ehlersdanlos,1,1.0,False

House lawmakers have rushed back to Washington to vote on President [Donald Trump](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/donald_trump/index.html)'s sweeping domestic agenda taking planes, trains and even a party bus to make it in time.

The [Senate](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/us-senate/index.html) passed the president's marquee legislative package dubbed the 'Big, Beautiful Bill' on Tuesday setting up the House for a last-second vote on the multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package before Independence Day on Friday. 

Trump has repeatedly prodded Congress to pass the bill before then so he can have a signing ceremony at the White House on the federal holiday, but as bad weather snarled Washington's airports, many had their flights canceled.

Refusing to let the inclement weather derail her travel plans, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., decided to ride in style for the overnight drive from her district to D.C. 

Mace, 47, and her staff posted videos of their half-day journey aboard a decked-out sprinter van with LED lights and plush leather seats. 

The clips of the impromptu road trip show Mace donning pink heart pajamas while traveling from the Palmetto State to Capitol Hill with her team and her dog named Liberty. 

'I'm here to save my country, so come hell or high water, I was gonna get here on time,' she told the Daily Mail just after her arrival. 

'We got here five minutes before the first vote.' 

On the journey Mace and her staffers made stops at road trip staples Wawa and Waffle House.

A video posted by the congresswoman's team shows Mace carrying her dog into Wawa and purchasing three Redbull for the overnight voyage. She wanted to keep their driver, a constituent, fueled and alert for the 12-hour ride. 

When she needed to refuel herself, the South Carolina lawmaker ordered a stop at Waffle House for some breakfast chocolate pie. 

'Their chocolate pie is the best,' she admitted, but she was soon disappointed because 'they ran out' of her favorite treat.   

'So I had chocolate chip waffles and I had hash browns, and we made sure that they had fresh coffee available,' she told the Daily Mail. 

It was unclear whether the congresswoman originally had a flight into D.C. that was canceled, as was the case for scores of lawmakers trying to get back in time to vote on Trump's agenda. 

Fellow South Carolina Republican Rep. Russell Frye, for example, opted to drive to the Capitol from Myrtle Beach after his flight was canceled on Tuesday. 

Other lawmakers had more harrowing journeys, like Illinois Democrat Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who was forced to drive 14 hours from Chicago to D.C. after his flight was canceled. 

Both sides of the aisle felt the urgency to return to Capitol Hill to vote for or against Trump's mega-bill, which includes no tax on tips or overtime, funding for border security, reforms to Medicaid and SNAP and many other provisions. 

Nobody wants to talk about growth, which will be the primary reason that the Big, Beautiful Bill will be one of the most successful pieces of legislation ever passed,' the president posted on social media Wednesday. 

'Our Country will make a fortune this year, more than any of our competitors, but only if the Big, Beautiful Bill is passed!' 

And Trump is personally lobbying on-the-fence lawmakers to get in line and support his agenda. 

The president has planned meetings at the White House on Wednesday to sway lawmakers who are considering voting against the sweeping, nearly 900-page measure. 

Following the meeting, the House is expected to take a procedural vote to advance the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ",1,1751479721.0,FuckNancyMace,1,1.0,False

So this happened yesterday and I'm still cringing. I work at a marketing firm and we had our quarterly office party. Sarah (28F) from accounting has been looking different lately, like glowing but also tired? She's been wearing loose clothes and I noticed she stopped drinking coffee which is weird because she used to down like 4 cups a day.

Anyway, I'm talking to a group of people including Sarah when someone mentions the new parental leave policy. Without thinking I go ""oh that's perfect timing for you Sarah!"" and everyone just stares. Sarah goes white and I realize she hasn't told anyone yet.

She pulls me aside later and says she's only 8 weeks and was waiting until 12 weeks to announce. Now I'm the office gossip who can't keep their mouth shut. Sarah says she forgives me but she seems cold. My manager hasn't said anything but I feel like everyone's looking at me weird.

I genuinely thought it was obvious and that she'd already told people. I feel terrible because what if something happens early on? Now there's all this pressure on her. I brought her favorite cookies today as an apology but I don't think it's enough.

TL;DR: Assumed my coworker had announced her pregnancy and accidentally outed her at the office party, now everyone knows and I feel like garbage.",2,1751479700.0,tifu,0,1.0,False

I open up the drain and… wow. It looked like a compost bin for a farmers market. Lettuce scraps, carrot peels, coffee grounds, rice, onion skins... you name it.

Turns out, they thought their garbage disposal could handle *anything*. They were basically using it like a wood chipper for leftovers.

I asked them if they ever ran water while using it. They said, “Oh, should I be doing that?”

After about an hour of carefully disassembling and snaking out what looked like a chopped salad gone wrong, we finally got things moving again.

I gave them the usual tips:

* Don’t treat your disposal like a trash can.
* Always run cold water while using it.
* Avoid fibrous veggies (they wrap around the blades like a bad hair day).
* And for the love of pipes everywhere, *no grease down the sink*.

They were super grateful, even gave me a loaf of homemade banana bread they were baking while I was there (way better than the salad, I promise).

So I’m curious: What’s the *weirdest* thing you or someone you know has put down the kitchen sink? Any horror stories? Let’s hear ‘em.

In the last 5 NBA drafts, there have been 94 selections made in the back third of the draft (Picks #41-60). Here's how their first seasons turned out:

**Didn't Play - 21 (22%)** \- Typically foreign players playing in other leagues

**Cup of Coffee - 54 (57%)** \- A majority of players fell into this bucket, playing 41 games or less and under 400 total minutes in their rookie years. On average, these players checked in to 17 games at just under 8 mpg.

**Bench Minutes - 12 (13%)** \- These rookies played between 500 and 1,000 total minutes, averaging 15 mpg in 48 games per year. Five of these players were drafted last year (Adem Bona, KJ Simpson, Pelle Larsson, Antonio Reeves, Quenten Post)

**Contributor - 7 (7%)** \- Only 7 late second rounders in the past five years have played meaningful minutes in their rookie years (20+ mpg in 40+ games or 68+ games played): KJ Martin, Kessler Edwards, Aaron Wiggins, GG Jackson II, Toumani Camara, Trayce Jackson-Davis, and Jamal Shead

  
Overall, 1/5 recent late second rounders played actual minutes in their rookie years, and even then their seasons weren't that spectacular.

Others need the mild panic of a deadline breathing down their neck to feel alive,. I’m very much among the others — my best work happens somewhere between “mild anxiety” and “backside on fire.” Thanks adult ADHD!

Of course the idea is to be more mindful, develop discipline, and not need the 6th cup of coffee to keep going.

I’m currently working on two major goals:

1. Building and launching my business. I have self respect and refuse to call it a startup (soon rather than eventually).
2. Getting my health and fitness in order (also sooner rather than later).

I’m not unmotivated, I just put the *pro* in procrastinator. Also, I tend to mask my character flaws with a fair bit of humor. Consider this full disclosure.

While I respond better to the stick than the carrot,  I’m happy to be the kind of accountability partner *you* need — cheerleader, drill sergeant, or just someone to check in with. In a previous life (non-startup), I led teams that consistently performed well, so I know how to push for results — including yours, if you’re up for it.

Ideally, we’d check in daily or a few times a week, share progress, set micro-goals, and call each other out when needed.

You walk in just wanting a $3 latte.

But while you’re waiting in line, there’s this perfect little muffin staring at you from the counter.

You think, “Ah screw it, it’s just two bucks.”

That’s exactly what they want.

Because here’s the twist: that tiny muffin often gives them more profit than your coffee.

They use the coffee to get you through the door.
Then quietly make the real money off the stuff you didn’t plan to buy.

It’s sneaky. It’s smart. It’s classic retail psychology.

However, my husband does something I cannot stand. Before we had the bag, he used to pick up the dog’s poos and put them in his pocket (in a poo bag, but these are pretty thin). Not a big deal — except he would never remember to take them out once he reached a bin. It got to the point that one winter he put his coat on for the first time that year and was surprised to find a year old shit in there. And he wasn’t even phased; he laughed. I always thought this was pretty disgusting but didn’t make a big deal out of it as it’s his own clothes. However, since he’s been using the dog-bag he’s been putting the poops in there — and still failing to throw them away. Multiple times I have taken the bag out with me and had a nasty surprise when I try to bring my phone out and put my hand around a rotting crap. I’ve brought this up with him a million times, first asking nicely and then moving to having a go at him, but nothing worked. When we’re walking together he’ll go to put it in there and I’ll have to tell him no every time, to which he complains that he doesn’t want to hold it and that it’s in a plastic bag so it isn’t gross. But it is gross — I don’t want the only barrier between a poo and my chewing gum to be a thin layer of plastic. And it’s just so unnecessary, especially considering that he always forgets to take it out. This has happened so many times, and he just wouldn’t listen at all. I shouldn’t even need to say this — I wouldn’t put a shit in my own bag, never mind someone else’s. Now here’s where I might be the asshole. I was so sick of this always happening, so when I pulled another out of the bag on a Friday afternoon I decided to show him how gross this actually is. I shoved the poo (still in the plastic bag) into the cup holder of his van. It’s been really hot lately, and the sun beats directly onto the black interior of his van, so it gets really hot. He also wouldn’t be out to work again until Monday. So of course, on Monday morning, his van likely stank. He came back into the house complaining that it reeked and that he’d put his coffee down onto a shit. I asked him if he still thought the bag kept it all inside, to which he yelled at me before taking a VIPoo spray and storming out. I’m not sure if I went too far, and whether I should stand by my choice or apologise. So, AITA? ",1,1751479053.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

[Link to Skill Trees] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kmTRDhng-Bkftori7RL9h6zTsz7dj-IG39W4wsSFyOI/edit?usp=sharing)

Example of a Warrior Arms skill tree;

https://i.imgur.com/MhtKo4M.png (See above skill tree link for more info)

> # 1. Talents and such 

All talent trees have been revamped and in most cases completely redone. For example, Warrior’s “Weapon Mastery” talent now grants a bonus based on the weapon being used, rather than specializing into a specific talent. Many talents and abilities will scale with items, stats, and other modifiers. Such as Improved Rend (Arms Warrior talent) being replaced with [Bloodletter].

The maximum number of points into a single talent has been reduced from 5 to 3.

After fully investing into certain talents (Denoted with Red Numbers) ((Not shown here sadly)), you may then choose an Augment for that talent which will provide additional bonuses. (This does NOT cost a skill point!);

https://i.imgur.com/UrpZFhc.png

You may change your Augment selection any time you are in a Rested Area, or by using an Augmenting Essence - an item made by Enchanters (more on this later).

Depending on which Augments you choose, your Focus Investment will change.

Focus Investments provide a unique buff, passive, or ability based on your chosen Augments.

* *[Unique Effect]* <-- This declares that this will not stack from other sources, and only the most potent effect will be applied to any given target.

While allocating talents to your passive tree, you will also grow with additional power based on the total number of talents in the tree. Each talent tree has a Secondary Stat it will help boost (usually two) - such as the Paladins Holy tree granting 1 Critical Strike Rating and 1 Spirit per point spent in the skill tree. This helps provide a bit more specialization feel and a small bit of power while leveling.

Every 5 points spent in a specialization tree also unlocks an additional passive for that skill tree. There are 6 “Innate Passives” from the specializations skill tree, shown below (**Arms Warrior)**.

_________________

Your Focus Investment is gained at 35 points and is based on your chosen Augments, and your Capstone Passive is acquired at level 60. Each Skill Tree has 5 talents with augments, and each class has 3 schools of Augments (such as Breaker, Tactician, and Unyielding for Warrior).

You can only have 3 of any one type of Augment active at once per skill tree.

For example a Fury Warrior with 1 Unyielding, 1 Tactician, and 3 Breaker Augments will activate the “Unleashing the Bloodthirsty” Focus Investment;

_________________

Only being able to pick 3 of any one variety of Augment will help to shake things up and allow for more expression and build customization, and incentivize a bit more critical thinking and problem solving with how you want to create your character and what play style you want to capitalize on.

Once you are level 60, you will be able to unlock one of 4 Capstone Passives for that specialization by embarking on a quest from your Class Trainer. Each Capstone passive has a quest one must complete in order to unlock it.

All Capstone Passives can be unlocked, and you can get the quest for all of them at once if you want, but only one can be active at a time. You can visit your Class Trainer anytime you wish to change the passive - at no cost. Alternatively you can find an Enchanter to help you out.

For example, a Retribution Paladin Capstone Passive;

_______________

The overall goal with these changes is to give more choice and flexibility, more variety -

which they say is the spice of life. More options is more fun, and fun is the name of the game.

Having Spirit be a more desirable stat for things other than mana regeneration helps to make itemization more interesting and impactful. (More on this later.)

> # 2. Spells/Abilities

Many spells, talents, and abilities have been moved. Some talents are no longer talents (Such as Consecration or Sweeping Strikes). There are many new spells and many new talents entirely, such as;
   
https://i.imgur.com/duXnDmv.png

______________

https://i.imgur.com/Dq9I7DQ

You may have noticed the [Stats in Brackets] often with a [ * Multiplier] on them. This is a scaling tool to tweak the potency of the Spell or Talent. For example, Blastback will reduce the cast time of your next Fireball spell by up to 15 + 30% of Spell Critical Strike Chance, depending on the rank of the Talent. Many skills and effects have these scaling properties. (If you have 30% Spell Crit, it would be 15 + 10 = 25%)

(Any modifier with a slash “/” like [Haste * 0.5/1/1.5] is to denote the value based on the number of skill points, not an actual division).

The value held in the Brackets is shown as the actual value. Holding Shift and mousing over it will show the formula for how it is calculated. If you have 30% Spell Crit, it will show as 25% for example. When holding Shift it will show 8+ [Spell Critical Strike * 0.2/0.25/0.3].

Having the effectiveness of different abilities and talents scale differently based on your itemization and Primary/Seconday stats is something that could be incredibly fun, interesting, and also easily tuned. Is a specific talent overperforming or underperforming? Simply tweak the coefficient a bit!
________________
Many spells which were talents have been made a trained ability, such as Sweeping Strikes, Consecration, Ice Barrier, Crusader Strike.

An all encompassing list of every single spell change/update is simply too much for me to put here right now, so I won’t. But yeah you get the idea.

Speaking of abilities, spell ranks and mana cost have been changed. The cost of a spell or ability is always equal to the highest spell rank known of that spell. The unintuitive and cumbersome “Downranking” system has oft been a nuisance for most players, and it only proves to clutter your keybinds (I had over 36 binds on my paladin for example) and is an archaic design. *(This is a buff).*

> # 3. Stats and Items

* Hundreds of new items have been added (THOUSANDS?!??)
* There are about 30 new Armor Sets.
* Set bonuses have been drastically adjusted.
* Tier Sets Secondary Stat Ratings and set bonuses change based on which skill tree your active Focus Investment is in. (Arms/Fury will have different bonus compared to Protection) Example Tier 1 Warrior “Might” gear


https://i.imgur.com/7fR5O8i.png


* Stats have been normalized for all classes. A point of Agility on a Warrior behaves the same way as a point of Agility on a Hunter or Priest for example.
* Spirit has been modified and normalized across all classes.
* Spirit interacts in many more ways, and modifies the effects of your Talents and Spells. As such, it is a much more desirable stat and is found on gear more often. Think of it as a “soft mastery” sort of stat.
* Most secondary Stats (Crit, Haste, Hit, etc) have been replaced with Rating values (as you can see above), rather than Flat % Increases. Some items still retain their flat % increases, and some can even have both, such as Lionheart Helm, Truestrike, Band of Accuria, Onslaught Girdle, Bonereaver’s Edge, etc.
* (Character Level + 1) * 0.27 = 1% Rating (At level 60, approximately 16 rating is 1% Stat) - These values can change based on talents, gear, and spec modifiers.
* Defense Skill now provides a small reduction to physical damage taken as well as increased chance to Block/Dodge/Parry and reduced chance for Crushing Blows etc. This only affects PvE encounters and does not function in PvP combat.


* Since “Defense” is a Skill and not a “Secondary Stat”, it is calculated a bit differently.
  * At all levels, 5 Defense Rating is 1 Defense Skill. So an item with 22 Defense Rating would give 4.4 Defense Skill.
  
* Large overhaul to many items. More items will be desirable, many iconic items remain the same, and items like Vendorstrike have been turned into something other than a Nexus Crystal.

* Added “Lineage” drop tables for various level and monster types, such as Naga, Ogre, Elemental, etc. These enemies will have a chance to specific items based on their level, lore and race, such as [Taken Candle] - dropped from level 12-20 Kobolds, [Waveripper’s Trident] - dropped from level 19-26 Naga, [Crown of the Ogre Savant] - dropped from level 30-38 Ogres, [Rusty Oversized Manacles] - dropped from level 40-46 Giants, Windswept Crest - dropped from level 52-56 Flying Beast, etc.
* These items can drop from any level-appropriate (level-appropriate = within 4 levels of required level of item) mob of their type, on top of their usual loot tables. There is nothing particularly special about them, just something fun and neat, more world drops.

1lq2imd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lq2imd/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_breville/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Breville VertuoPlus Review Worth It,"Having spent a few weeks putting the Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 through its paces, I feel like I’ve developed a genuine bond with this coffee maker. It’s not every day a kitchen gadget becomes part of your morning ritual, but this thing? It practically feels like a caffeine-powered family member. From opening the box to navigating its impressive features, the experience has been both delightful and, at times, slightly puzzling. Here's how it stacked up for me.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee machine has such a sleek and modern aesthetic that it almost feels like it belongs in a high-end café rather than on my kitchen counter. The Titan color is bold yet understated, giving it a professional yet approachable vibe. Its compact dimensions of 10.8""D x 14.75""W x 15.5""H fit comfortably in my limited counter space, which is something I didn’t truly appreciate until I started rearranging my kitchen around it. It’s surprisingly lightweight for its size, weighing in at just over 10 pounds, making any kitchen shuffling fairly painless. The ease of cleaning the reusable filter is an added boon. It’s clear the manufacturers put thought into blending style with practicality here.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Brews both coffee and espresso perfectly with just one button press.  
- Comes with the Nespresso Aeroccino3 for frothing milk effortlessly.  
- Compact yet robust build, ideal for small or larger kitchens alike.  
- Adjustable tray and large water reservoir save me from multiple refills.  

[Check Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b01n36ugge/)  

**Brewing Performance**  
The standout feature of this coffee maker is its Centrifusion extraction technology. When I first popped a capsule in, the machine read the barcode like it was futuristic tech out of a sci-fi movie, adjusting its brewing parameters perfectly. Whether it was a small shot of espresso or a larger cup of coffee, it nailed the taste and quality each time. Heating up in just 15-20 seconds is noteworthy because, let’s be real, no one has time for waiting in the mornings. I did try all four cup sizes—1.35 oz Espresso, 2.7 oz Double Espresso, 5.0 oz Gran Lungo, and 7.7 oz Coffee—and every single one had consistent flavor. My favorite has to be the Gran Lungo; it's like the sweet spot between regular coffee and espresso.  

**Milk Frothing Abilities**  
The Aeroccino3 milk frother bundled with this product is the unsung hero in the deal. I tested several types of milk (almond, oat, cow’s milk), and they all produced smooth, creamy froth within seconds. My go-to has become whipping up some cold froth for iced coffee on hot afternoons. The lack of noise or vibration keeps it from feeling intrusive, even during my quieter moments at home. However, I did notice that oat milk took a bit longer to froth perfectly compared to regular milk.  

**Ease of Use**  
This machine, thankfully, is ridiculously user-friendly. The idea of a single-button operation feels like a nirvana moment for those of us who aren’t morning people. Capsules are ejected automatically after brewing, which means I don’t have to wrestle with old, sticky capsules—not a glamorous process on other machines I’ve had. Its 60 oz water reservoir is large enough to keep me from constant refilling, saving time and energy. However, figuring out how to properly adjust the tray during my first week took me longer than I’m proud to admit.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Capsules are proprietary, limiting the flexibility to use third-party options.  
- Some frothing inconsistencies with non-dairy milk types.  
- Not the most budget-friendly option compared to simpler machines.  

**Competing Brands**  
I’ve had past encounters with other single-serve coffee makers like the Keurig K-Café and the Nespresso Essenza Mini. The Breville VertuoPlus pulls ahead of the competition in brewing customization and taste, thanks largely to its Centrifusion technology. The Keurig, while versatile, doesn’t offer quite the same espresso quality. Meanwhile, the Essenza Mini feels like it lacks the premium feel and versatility brought by the bundled Aeroccino3. However, I’ll give Keurig credit for its broader coffee pod selection, which the Breville machine doesn’t match.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For a coffee maker in this price range, the Breville BNV450TTN1BUC1 sits comfortably in the premium category. The craftsmanship and the included features justify the cost to a large extent. While some may find it a stretch, the ability to make both coffee and espresso from a single machine, combined with the frother, keeps it far ahead in delivering quality beverages. I would say it's very much worth it for coffee lovers who appreciate a luxurious cup at home.

I’ve consumed cannabis almost daily  
since 16 aswell (though this has been much less of an issue for me personally, I immediately feel the need to be productive after smoking / don’t let it turn me lazy). 

I generally go through a vuse pod in about a day. And buy a 4 pack every 3-4 days or so.

Started with the 5% ones but now use the 2.4% ones. (Yes it is a stupid amount of money for a stupid thing). 

I’ve been trying to quit or atleast tapper down for a month or two now but am having so much trouble doing so..

I have straws & toothpicks & a sad dusty pack of nicorette gum that I tried a piece of but couldn’t stand / tasted so nasty & spicy that it just sits there. 

I work from home, so it’s very easy to vape all day. I try to talk walks, do dishes, etc to get me out of the room & my vape. 

I go to get a new pack before my current even runs out.. 

I have basically trained my brain that by the end of the day the pod should be empty. 
If it isn’t i’ll stay up & vape till it almost is.. 

But my brain just doesn’t care. 
It’s like there are 2 separate versions of me, and one doesn’t have ears or a heart. 

I’ll try putting my vape in a different room, and find myself going to get it & hit it every 30 minutes..

I’ll call myself names / actively be thinking about how weak & lame it is i’m doing this (going to grab it from the other room). 

I do have a bit of a, idk, a complex of sorts. 
I’ve made music since 16, so there’s always this like, oh idk how to place it, 
A “Hunter S Thompson” writers mindset that it’s just what I do & just what creative / complex people do.. lame i know. 

At this point I just really need some encouragement. Like even as I write this i’m excited to finish so I can hit my vape & sip my coffee.. 

I’m slowly trying to use it less & less, which is kind of working. 

At the moment it’s a big step for me to even just say “not now” when the instinct kicks in or to go a few hours without it.. 

A few weeks ago i had a lil panic attack, felt a lump in my armpit, increased heart rate, etc.
Spiraled into me going to the ER but they didn’t find any issues (heart, blood & chest scan test all came back find). 

They said it was most likely Musculoskeletal chest pains + anxiety which originally i did not agree with / believe at all. 
I do feel significantly better now / it has mainly passed but still feel some pains here and there. 

Has anyone else who smoked & vaped for this long / much have experience tapering off / quitting? 

At this point getting a 4 pack of Vuse pods to last a week would be a huuggee improvement for me.. let alone quitting out right. 

Well this isn’t very short anymore, thanks though.

1lq2gp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1lq2gp0/modern_star_wars_writers_are_foundationally/,Modern Star Wars writers are foundationally incapable of portraying the atmosphere of the original Star Wars universe,"Classic Star Wars is a campy sci-fi imitation of WWII and Age of Sail swashbuckler flicks viewed through the US middle-class experience in the 1970s, but modern Star Wars is a campy sci-fi imitation of classic Star Wars viewed through the upper-middle class LA creative-industry experience in the 2020s.

A random example from Andor S2E2: Imperial agents go to inspect various stations on a farming planet. Entirely gone are the crisp, impartial, disciplined, hostile inflections, commands, authority signals, and actions of the (silly and campy!) classic Empire; the agents now speak like they're hesitant, uncertain millenials from LA, awkwardly propositioning farm girls and musing hesitantly about their own careers and feelings. Some of the agents walk into a ""refreshments stop"" or a ""cantina"" in the middle of a wheat field to poke around and talk to the locals and it's set up exactly like every urban coffee shop anyone's been into since 2016; there's a counter, a three-tier bakery tray with takeaway items next to a register device. Everyone's got hair and makeup like they're teaching community college, and across classes everyone's dialect matches perfectly (American, upper middle class, LA creative accents.) It's like the cast, writers, and directors haven't even watched movies about the military or the police or farmers or rural businesses, much less experienced any of these things for themselves.

I could go through every interaction between any character in any of Andor S2 through the first three episodes and point out the same thing; if you don't believe me, watch the first 30 minutes of Andor S2 and then watch the first 30 minutes of Empire Strikes Back. Both instances are displaying campy ""imperial army"" characters and scenarios modelled after the British Navy and the Nazis, and both instances are portraying ""plucky gang of rogues"" characters and scenarios modelled after folk myths about the American revolution and American bands of extreme sports athletes, farmers, etc; but Empire has a far, far more true-to-life atmosphere than Andor, which at times feels like charades at acting school rather than a show about a war set in a galaxy where people do real work. There's a scene in the HBO show ""Barry"" where he describes his experience in the military:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lylcHY6tXXQ

The charades-like retelling that his classmates perform is almost exactly what the characters are actually doing in Andor S2.

It's like watching those ""breaking ground"" ceremonies where all the investors of a big high-rise come to ""dig the first shovel of dirt"" and half of them don't even know how to hold a shovel.

One argument that could be made is that Andor is trying to portray the Star Wars universe through the eyes of people who live in the US today, not the people who lived in the US in the 1970s, and so they want to imitate modern Americans, who would not talk like the Empire or Tatooine-dwellers of 1970s Star Wars. That's fine; but in that case, where are the Zyn-ed out crew-cut Morgan Wallen-listening Empire agents and the hipster Carhartt rock-climbing Subaru Rebellion members?

I believe this lack of atmosphere-ability is a result of the lack of technical refinement and real-world experience of the modern writers/directors/actors/crew; even if they wanted to be more accurate with the types of actions they're putting on screen, they don't actually have any experience with the military, or high society, or guerilla groups, or engineering, or dirtbag biker gangs, etc. This means that their attempts at portraying these elements within the Star Wars universe come across as extremely silly and unbelievable compared to classic Star Wars portrayals of the same, which were at the very least obviously written and acted by people who had in their lifetime met military pilots, drifters, weird old monks, construction workers, etc. Harrison Ford was a carpenter and no doubt had actually spent time in bars with bad, broken-down tough guys, so it was easy for him to pretend to be one himself. George Lucas wanted to be a racecar driver and put thousands of hours into car maintenance and extreme racing circuits before getting into filmmaking.

Like many Star Wars fans, I love to complain, but unlike many Star Wars fans who complain, I'm not particularly upset about the ""health"" or ""purity"" of the Star Wars franchise, which clearly will be around for a very long time and has always been of questionable quality anyway. Andor is plenty fun and I'll probably watch the whole thing. I don't spend a lot of time consuming Star Wars content anymore, and I can always go back and watch the original movies if I'm feeling nostalgic for a flick where the Space British Navy soldiers act kind of like the classic British Navy. There will always be new room in the universe for a new Star Wars movie or show that does a better job of writing, acting, directing, etc. But they have all this money and attention today--it would be nice if they put some more effort into writing and portraying characters and settings that come close to either matching the atmosphere of classic Star Wars, or matching the atmosphere of war, farming, engineering, high society etc. of the 2020s.",0,1751478587.0,StarWars,3,0.5,False

I saw that Reggae On The Way is happening on July 12, and I’d really love to go. The lineup looks great, and this kind of music is totally my vibe. I’m not new to the area, but I don’t really know anyone locally.

Here’s a quick description from their website ([https://www.reggaeontheway.com/about](https://www.reggaeontheway.com/about)):

Back when I lived on the East Coast, I had a good buddy (my extroverted brother from another mother) who I’d go to shows like this with. He made it easier for me to get out and enjoy the music I love. I’m very introverted and have a lot of anxiety about crowded events, so going alone usually isn’t an option. I don't want to commit to a ticket unless I can find someone—or a group—to go with.

Just putting this out there in case anyone is already planning to go and wouldn’t mind a chill tag-along. I’m 59, mellow, and easygoing. Totally open to meeting up for a walk or a coffee ahead of time if that helps make things more comfortable.

Feel free to send me a DM if this sounds like your vibe.

Thanks for reading. :-)

I took my first 2.5 injection yesterday and I can already tell there's something profound going on. I'm a 67 year-old female foodie who has never tried dieting, so it's really odd for me to enter into this paradox of limiting food intake (so I don't over-react to the Zep) while also bolstering protein. Despite reading the many interesting posts here about how people reacted to their first dose, I somehow couldn't believe I would immediately stop being hungry. It's truly bizarre to just feel full most of the time! This is going to take a lot to process.

**Keep reading if you want the nitty gritty, but before you leave, please accept my thanks to all who have reported here on their experiences. It's a gift for which I'm so grateful!**

After learning that Zepbound can help with obstructive sleep apnea, I decided that's the plus factor that would motivate me to deal with a new drug, one that involves needles, no less. I hate using my CPAP machine, and would do almost anything to get rid of it. My kids had urged me to try a GLP1 so that I could lose the excess weight I carry around--aiming to get more joy out of hiking and other outdoor adventures. My doctor readily prescribed Zep. Then came lots of confusing back and forth with United Healthcare and Medicare, with coverage denied, apparently because they think I'm actually trying to get the drug for weight loss, which Medicare won't permit. I finally decided to buy through Lilly Direct, which offers only the vials, not the handy pens. It's expensive but I didn't want to wait any longer.

Yesterday the kind nurse at my PCP's office walked me through my first injection. I'm pretty needle-phobic, so I've never watched someone give me a shot. I forced myself to look, and it was literally painless. I hope I can do as well when I take over the job next week. 

Although I was well-hydrated, within 30 minutes I had a mild headache; it responded to Advil. Not a big issue at all.

It was lunchtime and I was a bit hungry, so I ate some string cheese and cherries as I made the long drive home. I stopped at a produce stand along the way and just stood staring at the food, wondering what in the heck I would want to eat. I picked up some beans, zucchini, and fresh-made waffle cones to supplement my haul from Costco and Trader Joe's the day before. Once home, I ate a sandwich of pesto, goat cheese, and tomatoes, and continued chugging water. A couple hours later I ate a couple handfuls of cashews, and that's when the feeling of fullness kicked in. I didn't feel bad, but was glad I stopped when I did! 

I could have easily skipped dinner, but I decided to eat a small salad and a cracker. Had about 2 ounces of wine and a couple bites of gelato after dinner. None of what I ate repelled me, which is a relief, as I'd been worried about losing interest in the foods I love. 

Overnight burps and GERD were pretty bad, and I sure didn't wake up hungry. But coffee with milk sailed through just fine, and I eventually settled on some Greek yoghurt with berries and granola. Now I wait: to see when I'll be hungry, if I'll be nauseated, if I'll lose weight and want to keep this up. I'm not used to thinking so much about food (other than spending hours looking at recipes :)  It will be an adjustment, but at least so far the reality of my entry into Zep-land has been interesting and non-threatening.

I make posts like these because there is a lack of information on how to do it, what to expect, and what works the best. If I miss anything, I apologize. I am an engineering student so my free time is limited, this has been a project ongoing for a few months, and you would be able to tell by how different the replica looks in some pictures. But lets get into it. 



# The SVU, its Flaws, and its Fixes

I chose the SVU because I like to be different and take on builds that are unique. I had previously done an AEG build on this platform before but deemed it unworthy of the time, money, and effort. But this was before brushless motors and SVU/SVD specific mosfets have come out. 

The SVU itself is a very pretty gun with its own unique flaws. Firstly the stock angle is very bad. The rifle will slip down from your shoulder when you're trying to aim. I have found that there are [3d printed solutions](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5428146) for free out there that help remedy this issue. Still not perfect, but it helps. Though it will be a bit wobbly if you only use half of the motor cage. 

Another fundamental flaw with this platform pertains to the MLOK version, and its that the top rail is secured by a plastic nub. If your top rail has optics or accessories that are too heavy, the top rail will slip from its spot and fall off. This is fixed by 3d printing a rail cover that will fix to the rail and be screwed in through the rear sight holder. I haven't posted the final version yet, but once I do, ill link it here. Its also worth noting that any optic sitting on the bare top rail will not be tall enough to look through unless you're not wearing face pro. Plan for a tall riser, or just use the ones I've included in those files.

The trigger on the SVU is also pretty garbage, just as they are on most bullpups. There is a linkage that goes back to the gearbox and pulls the carrier. This is another friction point when building this into a competent platform. The trigger travel is long with no way of tuning it. I have since designed a separate trigger assembly that uses a micro switch for a very clean and light trigger to get rid of that trigger bar. It allows for very fast follow up shots and just feels better. Those files are also being refined but I will post them soon as well. It does require you to drill a small hole into the receiver of the gun that will be hidden by the grip and removes the safety. Though I think its a very good trade off.

https://preview.redd.it/xvra1nlrlhaf1.jpg?width=1465&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a832a89bbfd98bd4f4441c1b9521b2380b3eda2b

Battery space is another point of friction when dealing with this platform. I dabbled with the idea of stuffing the FCU into the stock, but I couldn't make an elegant work around for it. Then I thought about shoving it into the grip, but unscrewing the bottom cap will eventually wear out the plastic threads, so that's a no go. I have then decided to front wire it into a hollow battery PEQ box you can get for 10 bucks on amazon and put it up front. This allowed me to put the FCU and battery in, as well as only requiring one small screw to access it. The standard harness that comes with the kit isn't long enough to bring the peq all the way to the front MLOK slot, so plan accordingly if that's a small detail you'd like to have on yours. I did this by drilling a hole into the bottom of the peq box that's large enough for the front end of the JST connection, then slipped it through and connected it to the FCU. The braided part of the harness will need to CAREFULLY be cut back in order to fit into the side of the mag well, as you can see by the yellow electrical tape holding it in. I cut it about half way, which is enough.

# The HPA Engine

Now I went with the F2 because I have had good experiences with them. They're very consistent (foreshadowing), efficient, and look cool. There are other engines you can get to do this, but the kicker is that it needs an ***offset nozzle.*** For this CYMA SVU, I ordered the F2 Offset kit for the **CYMA SVD**, not the Real Sword one. This kit will come with the standard braided cable, the engine, line, fcu, and a trigger board. 

When I installed this engine into the gearbox, I immediately saw some issues. First there was a part I had to shave down, though when really looking back on it, it may have not been necessary.

The second thing I noticed was that the engine fit loosely in the gearbox shell. It would twist and slide forward and backward. To help remedy this, I did two things: Put a piece of electrical tape on both sides of the front of the engine and 3d printed a spacer. The electrical tape will help it sit firmly in the shell while the spacer prevented it from rotating. Now, normally rotating on an HPA engine is fine, but since this is an offset nozzle, any rotation will mess up your alignment badly. I have the files for the alignment tab to download and print [right here](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/cyma-svu-svd-f2-alignment-tab). Its open priced (free), but if you'd like to buy me a coffee from throwing all this information out, feel free to do so. 

Now that your engine is sitting nicely and perfectly straight in the gearbox, lets talk about the trigger board.

There are 5 ports: CON1 = Nozzle Solenoid, CON2 = Poppet Solenoid, CON3 = Selector Input, CON4 = Trigger Input and the big middle one for your FCU harness. If you're looking at your engine sitting in the gearbox, the top solenoid goes to into CON1 and the lower one goes into CON2. To wire up a trigger, you will need CON4. You will need to order 24AWG JST ZH1.5mm 2PIN Micro Electrical Male and Female Connector Plugs, I got mine off of amazon. 

If you want a semi only build, do not worry about the Selector Input. Solder your trigger wires to the main trigger contacts if you still use the linkage. The instructions on how to wire my microswitch trigger will be included with the files. 

Now if you want full auto, you will need to get a bit crafty. The way I had done it was I wired a micro switch in a way where its open when the switch is pressed, and closed when the switch is released. This will be connected to the cut off switch of the gearbox. The way its wired as such is that when the gun is normally in full auto, the cut off lever will lower and depress the switch, so you want that closed signal to tell the FCU that its in mode 2 (full auto, burst, whatever). The trick is getting the angle of the micro switch right, setting the teeth of the selector lever in the right position, and making sure that the switch actuates whenever you change the position of the fire selector. It will take some trial and error, but its doable. I believe I held the switch into the gearbox with super glue, I cant remember.

https://preview.redd.it/f4ajlg6wthaf1.jpg?width=3168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e4132ee914cdbcbc01a304bce6dfff620d3cb39

If you wish to front wire your engine, trim this side of the harness wires and route it through the hole the other two wires are going through. That way you can use the indents from the original aeg wires to feed it through the front without having it get snagged. Now install your gearbox in properly, test everything, plug your FCU in to make sure the trigger is connected and if the selector switch is working (if you decided to do so). We will worry about FCU settings next.



# The Hopup, My Recommendations, and Tuning the FCU

Now that your power train has been installed, its time to make this thing shoot like a DMR. Thankfully the hop chamber is actually really good and a TDC out of the box.

 Originally I had installed a maple leaf TBB paired with a MR hop and omega nub and boy was my FPS all over the place. The engine HATED that setup. 

I had since installed a 430mm Lambda ""ONE"" tbb, a 4uad friction pro bucking, and their included nub and holy shit lol. When paired with 43s, this made my sniper obsolete, and when tuned, it is hilariously consistent. Jut look at this chronograph (every time i do it makes me laugh)

https://preview.redd.it/jf6zhqlewhaf1.jpg?width=1816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daf58dea2fcff95e0b5bb15f08e5043b36fb4374

This is 1.9J on the dot on 43s with about 85 psi of pressure, this is peak DMR right here. I used MATRIX 0.43g bbs, but oddly enough, it hates their 0.4s. There was quite a bit of deviation with the 0.4s. 

You will still have quite a bit of outer barrel length over your inner barrel. I chose this length barrel because it was originally for a different build. My outer barrel has also been cut down quite a bit for this project im doing, so it fits perfectly anyways. But it wouldn't be a bad idea to spring for a longer inner barrel and increase the dwell while decreasing the PSI. You should get the same consistency but with a quieter sound.

Now to tuning the FCU, if you decided you wanted to have the same set up as me, here are my settings:

* Cbon
* dr22
* dn16
* dP28
* iP00
* iS00
* S201
* S101
* Sr01
* rF18
* FCFE

These settings ensure proper air voluming and reliability when using the 120rd mid caps. But of course you can fiddle with settings as you please, like fire rate and stuff.



# Final Thoughts

This is a platform that is absolutely worth building once you've filed down the rough edges. Its lighter, more compact, and more efficient than a standard m4, even more so than a standard DMR rifle. If youre like me, you will have a hard time debating if you want to keep this as a DMR or a very compact and quiet rifleman build.

I’ll just drink the whole thing almost without thinking. Same with snacks like a bowl of Maltesers during a film. I intend to pick at them, but I’ll eat the lot straight away without realising.

1lq263c,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1lq263c/experiencing_strange_appetite_fluctuations_and/,Experiencing strange appetite fluctuations and anxieties on Concerta (54mg),"Hello everyone! 🤗

I'm 25 years old and I have been officially diagnosed with ADHD since January 2024. I started taking Concerta in March of the same year - first it was 18mg but now I'm safely in the 54mg zone.

Long story short, it has changed my life for the better. It's actually quite upsetting to think about just how much of the heartbreak and stress I could've been spared in school and uni, had I been medicated this whole time.

However, there is one thing that is beginning to increasingly worry me... which is appetite. Now, I was told by my doctor that Concerta isn't prescribed to people who have had eating disorders before, which I haven't. He also said that should my appetite get so out of hand that I develop an eating disorder *because* of them, I need to tell him as well. Yes, my appetite changed drastically and I lost about 8kg in the first couple of months of taking the meds. Now, I can't lie to you... I didn't mind that that much, I needed to lose that weight and I look and feel better about myself than ever, which is nice. And it wasn't like I noticed the weight-loss was happening - the main issue was not having appetite when I was supposed to (meaning, when the family put the lunch on the table and I simply Could Not Eat It). Thankfully, that feeling went away by the summer/autumn though and I was back to eating normally. I also carefully monitored all of it and noticed, for example, that I need to eat breakfast and have coffee before taking the pill etc.

Except now... my appetite issues have come back but in a different way. I am finding it very difficult to describe and I also have not found anybody on the internet recounting anything remotely similar, which worries me. 

Again, my appetite through the day depends on having breakfast and coffee before the meds. I will get hungry for lunch/dinner between 4-6pm. But then, I will cook myself something... and be entirely incapable of eating it, even to the point where it sometimes makes me gag. I have noticed that a way of circumventing this is by distracting myself with my phone or by making my flatmate chat to me, though this does not work every time. Furthermore, I have also realised that it's usually very specific foods this happens to - mainly pasta (in fact, as I am typing this, a half-eaten plate of tagliatelle with tomato sauce is staring right at me). I don't have a gluten allergy, so I don't think it's that (the aforementioned tagliatelle happen to be gluten-free). I did notice that it happens more when the pasta doesn't have any meat, though one time a standard lasagna made me feel like this too. On top of that, as soon as this feeling begins, I start getting extremely anxious/unsettled because of it, which is probably making it all worse.

Now, I have considered that this might just be a circumstantial issue. I have been living abroad this academic year and, as I'm sure a lot of you know, student life can be quite challenging in terms of food - especially finance-wise. I can't go out or get takeaway every day. I also can't really cook ""complicated"" meals like steaks and whatnot in the kitchen that I have. And also, I am allergic to a few things, which generally limits my food options anyway. But most importantly, the main reason why I think (and, honestly, *hope*) this is circumstantial is the fact that as soon as I return home, my appetite will be right back to normal. I can even eat cursed pasta normally. So could this all really just be a mental blockade of (financial) stress and the lack of family-cooked food?

Speaking of allergies - I have read a few similar accounts like this, where people have suggested snacking a lot, particularly on high-protein things. Problem is, I'm deathly allergic to nuts and a lot of snack-y protein bars include nuts. Other healthy options are fruits and vegetables of course but they aren't filling enough to be substantial?

I hope any of this made sense. I don't really know what my question is here, if I even have one. I suppose, I'd just like to know if anybody has ever experienced anything remotely similar and could therefore offer some advice. Thank you!",1,1751477892.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

How excited he was to see the Hollywood Sign.



The burger he was going to order from In-N-Out.



Lakers *this*, Clippers *that*.



But when the day finally came, and he was supposed to leave for LA, my Dad missed his flight. He lied down for a nap and slept through his alarm.



The plane went down somewhere over Salt Lake City. Mechanical failure. One hundred and forty-seven casualties. No survivors.



Initially, I thought my Dad was on the plane. He had been hyping it up nonstop for so long that I was sure there was no way he’d have missed his flight.



You can imagine my surprise when he texted me that he was fine.



He took his sweet time, too. I believed he was dead for almost two days before he shattered the illusion. I was halfway through planning his estate when he said that it “wouldn’t be necessary.”



Still, I said we should meet up at his place so I could see how he was doing. He had almost died, after all, and I was sure he was probably a bit shaken.



“I feel great.”



Or not.



“That’s good to hear, Dad,” I said, “sorry your trip to LA didn’t work out, I know you were looking forward to it.”



“Naw, I never cared much for LA. I just wanted to go to make you jealous.”



Asshole. He knew that going to LA had always been *my* dream. Seeing the Walk of Fame, getting a hot dog at Dodgers Stadium, all of it. *Mine*.



“Well, I’m lucky you didn’t invite me then. I’d be flat as a pancake somewhere near Salt Lake.”



“I *did* invite you,” he smiled, “I just didn’t offer to pay for it.”



That’s my Dad for you. I’ll never understand why rich people are so stingy with their money. He could have made lifelong memories with his daughter, and it’d have cost pennies to him, but then I wouldn’t learn the value of a dollar.



“And I’d have joined you,” I responded, “*if* I could have afforded it.”



“I’ll never understand why your generation is so lazy. It’s my fault for not teaching you the value of hard work.”



“Why don’t I get us a cup of coffee,” I interjected, “you still take it black?”



He nodded, and I went to the kitchen.



I poured us both a cup of coffee, and then I poured a little something extra into my Dad’s. Hopefully he wouldn’t notice how bitter it was in the strong coffee.



If only he knew *exactly* how much I valued hard work. Afterall, it wasn’t easy getting a part time job at the airport. Or befriending the janitors, mechanics, and pilots. It was *very* hard getting in and out of the plane without anybody noticing, and even harder to set it all up to look like an accident.

I had to find a boring desk job due to getting anger issues after so many years of retail. Most people who walk into are entitled. You think because you pay for a service , the employees are your personal slaves or something. If we tell you we can’t do stuff in store, you need to call, it’s not because we don’t want to help. It’s because capitalism outsources customer service overseas. And no we won’t call for you. 

Then there’s the people who walk in and the moment you say no to something they ask, they go full Karen. Example, no I won’t put on ur screen protector you bought at Amazon, when we sell our own here. It’s not our “job” to do that for you. You wanted the convenience of cheaper pricing, then do it at home. Idk why people assume they can get service for free these days. Then there’s those that walk in and expect us to read your mind about what’s wrong or how to fix it. You go off on a rant and lord knows what you’re even getting to.

Special shout out to cafe customers. Yes it costs extra to add extra stuff. No we won’t hook you up. No we won’t give you a free one because you dropped it at home. Once you leave the door, a number of things can happen. Not our responsibility. I’ve had coworkers had coffee thrown at them for not wanting to remake a drink FOR THE FOURTH TIME because it doesn’t taste right. ( probably because you ordered something different last time) 

I already expect the “if you don’t like your job find another one” crowd to comment. This isn’t, I don’t want to do my job. This is, I have parameters in which I can help you, anything beyond that is not my job. Phone store job. No we can’t help you get into your Facebook. If the employee wants to, sure up to him, but it’s not our job and don’t get mad when someone says no. If you can’t handle something like that, go back to a flip phone. Dog grooming jobs I’ve job, no we won’t babysit your dog an hour past your pickup time for free. There’s a fee. Idc if you got tied up. Be an adult and manage your shit.

I’d say in hotel, cafe, retail, and dog grooming jobs I’ve had, on average, I’d get maybe 2 or 3 pleasant customers who understand and work with me on finding them a solution. But most everyone else becomes a chore to deal with the moment you say no to them. And that’s not “no, leave my store”, that’s “no I can’t do that”.  So when we do get those pleasant customers, we make sure we hook them up. That’s right. We go above and beyond when you’re not an a hole. You can get that service, just stop thinking you’re above a retail worker or they’re your personal slave. 

All this to say, if you recognize yourself or these behaviors in what I’ve described, order online or have someone else go in store for you. Or reflect on why you’ve had bad experiences in store, and find the common factor is your attitude towards a no. And to go back to the title, yes if you’re rude or demanding about service and retail workers find themselves helping you anyways, they’ll probably do something to your account or charge you more without applying discounts because of your attitude. I can tell you how many people qualified for free show tickets for the hotel I worked at that I didn’t mention to them because of their attitudes ( and no, we didn’t have to give them. It was a “while supplies last” thing so I can pick and choose who i give it to)

My husband, Ethan Hayes, was a powerful, arrogant man, openly flaunting his mistress, Chloe Vance.
Everyone pitied me, the quiet, obedient wife, living in his shadow.
But they had no idea.
Every humiliation, every cruel dismissal, every moment of neglect was a calculated step in my secret, desperate plan.
I married Ethan for one reason: to have a child.
Not his child, but Caleb's.
Caleb, his identical twin, the man I loved more than life itself, tragically taken too soon.
Ethan was merely a vessel, a living replica of my soulmate.
When that pr**nancy test turned positive, my mission was complete.
I filed for divorce, expecting his usual dismissiveness.
He waved me off, telling me to""handle it,"" too consumed with Chloe's trivial demands.
He even pushed me down the stairs when Chloe falsely accused me, leaving me bleeding, gasping for our baby.
But the final straw came when Chloe, with Ethan's blessing, shattered a small, invaluable snow globe-Caleb's last, unfulfilled gift to me.
He thought my tears, my quiet""devotion,"" my carefully curated items were for him.
He never saw the truth, never understood his own arrogance blinded him to the woman he truly possessed.
How could he?
His ego was too vast.
So, when the divorce was finalized, I called him.
""I never loved you, Ethan,"" I told him, each word a shard of ice.
""You were just a means to an end.
The child I carry is Caleb's legacy, not yours.""
I walked away, leaving him and his empty world behind, to start anew in San Francisco, with Caleb's child, and finally, my own freedom.

He'd been on the phone with Chloe Vance, his voice syrupy sweet, a tone he never used with Ava.

""Ethan, we need to discuss this,""  she had said, holding out the documents.

He'd waved a dismissive hand, his eyes still glued to his phone screen, a smile playing on his lips for Chloe.

""Just handle it, Ava. I don't care about your trivial matters. Chloe needs me to pick up some rare tea she can only get downtown."" 

Trivial matters. Their marriage.

His words, sharp and careless, now served her purpose.

""He indicated he doesn't wish to be bothered with the details, Mr. Peterson,""  Ava continued, her voice smooth. ""He said to  'just handle it'."" 

Mr. Peterson paused. ""Well, if he's truly non-responsive and has verbally agreed... we can proceed under the assumption of an uncontested divorce after the mandatory waiting period. I'll need to serve him notice, of course."" 

""Of course,""  Ava agreed. She knew Ethan. Notices from lawyers, especially about her, would be dismissed as more trivialities, especially if Chloe was demanding his attention.

She hung up, a small, genuine smile finally gracing her features.

She ran a hand over her still-flat stomach, then carefully wiped down a small, worn silver locket on her nightstand – a locket that wasn't Ethan's.

Downstairs, the clatter of breakfast preparations was punctuated by hushed voices.

Maria, the head housekeeper, was talking to one of the newer maids.

""Mr. Hayes was out with Miss Vance again last night. Charity gala. Mrs. Hayes stayed home."" 

""She always stays home,""  the new maid whispered back. ""Does he even see her?"" 

""He sees Miss Vance,""  Maria said, a note of disapproval in her voice. ""Poor Mrs. Hayes. So quiet, so devoted. And for what?"" 

Devoted. Ava almost laughed. If they only knew.

Her mind drifted, as it always did, to Caleb.

Ethan's identical twin. Her Caleb.

The world saw Ethan Hayes, wealthy, arrogant, dismissive.

Ava saw a vessel, a perfect, living replica of the only man she had ever loved.

She had married Ethan Hayes for one reason only: to have Caleb's child.

And now, she had.

Caleb. Kind, artistic, loving. The exact opposite of his brother in every way but appearance.

They had met in college, a whirlwind romance that felt like a lifetime.

His laughter, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled, the feel of his hand in hers.

Then, the accident. A drunk driver, a rainy night, during their senior year at NYU.

One moment he was there, vibrant and full of life, sketching her in his worn notebook.

The next, he was gone.

The world had shattered. Grief consumed her, a black hole threatening to swallow her whole.

For years, she had merely existed.

Then, the idea, desperate and wild, had taken root. Ethan.

A child that would look like Caleb, laugh like Caleb, perhaps even share his gentle soul.

A living echo.

Ethan had been easy to persuade into marriage.

His family, influential on the East Coast, had been pressuring him to settle down.

Chloe Vance, his long-time obsession, was conveniently""studying abroad"" – a euphemism for chasing acting gigs in Europe with his funding.

""I don't love you, Ava,""  Ethan had said, blunt and cold, during their pre-nuptial discussion. ""This is a convenience for both of us. My family gets off my back, and you... well, you get whatever it is you want from this."" 

""I understand,""  Ava had replied, her voice betraying nothing of the fierce, desperate hope thrumming beneath her calm exterior. ""No love. I accept."" 

He'd looked at her then, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes – perhaps surprise at her easy acquiescence – before shrugging it off.

He truly believed she was obsessively in love with him.

His arrogance was a shield, blinding him to the truth.

He saw her quiet demeanor as submissiveness, her careful attention to his preferences – which were, uncannily, often Caleb's preferences too – as adoration.

He paraded Chloe in front of her, made Ava fetch things for Chloe, prepare dishes Chloe craved.

Ava endured it all, a ghost in her own marriage, her focus singular.

The public humiliation at parties, where Ethan would dote on Chloe while Ava stood by, a forgotten accessory, meant nothing.

Let them whisper. Let them pity the poor, neglected Mrs. Hayes.

Ava didn't care about public opinion.

Her life had narrowed to a single, burning purpose: conception.

Every interaction with Ethan was a means to that end.

He misinterpreted her every action, her every carefully chosen word, seeing only what his ego wanted to see.

He was so consumed by his own infatuation with Chloe, he couldn't imagine Ava not being equally consumed by him.

It was a tragic, ironic parallel.

Now, the positive test confirmed it.

Her objective was met.

Her transaction with Ethan Hayes was nearing its completion.

She would have Caleb's child.

And then, she would disappear from Ethan's life as if she had never been there.

Chapter 2
Ethan Hayes strode into the penthouse, tossing his keys onto the marble console.

""Ava,""  he called out, his voice impatient. ""Chloe wants that Szechuan fish from the place downtown. The one you made that time she said was almost as good as the restaurant's. Get it for lunch."" 

Ava watched him, her eyes lingering for a moment on the vintage watch on his wrist. Caleb's watch.

It was one of the first things she'd ""asked""  for.

""Alright, Ethan,""  Ava said, her voice soft. ""But the traffic will be terrible. It'll take me a while."" 

She paused, then added, as if an afterthought, ""Could I... could I have that old leather-bound sketchbook? The one in your study? You never use it."" 

Ethan, already scrolling through his phone, presumably texting Chloe, grunted. ""Sketchbook? Fine, whatever. Just get the fish. Chloe's craving it."" 

He didn't even look up as she left the room.

This was their pattern.

He'd make a demand, usually related to Chloe's whims.

Ava would agree, then request one of ""his""  possessions – an old book, a worn sweater, a fountain pen.

Things that had belonged to Caleb.

Ethan, flattered by what he perceived as her sentimental attachment to his belongings, always agreed.

He thought she cherished these items because they were his.

He'd once found her carefully mending a tear in an old cashmere scarf – Caleb's scarf.

""Still doting on my old things, I see,""  he'd said, a smirk on his face. ""You really are obsessed with me, aren't you, Ava?"" 

Ava had simply smiled, a quiet, enigmatic smile that Ethan took for shy affirmation.

""I just like it,""  she'd said.

He didn't understand. He never would.

These items were fragments of Caleb, pieces of a life stolen too soon.

Each one was a treasure, a tangible link to the love she had lost.

Holding them, she could almost feel Caleb's presence, hear his gentle laugh.

Ethan, in his arrogance, saw only a wife's pathetic devotion.

""I love you, Ethan,""  she'd sometimes whisper, usually when he was distracted or half-asleep.

The words were for Caleb, always for Caleb.

But Ethan heard them, and his ego swelled.

Sometimes, a flicker of something – confusion? unease? – would cross Ethan's face when she made these requests for seemingly worthless objects.

He'd look at the item, then at her, a slight frown creasing his brow.

But then Chloe would call, or a business demand would arise, and the moment would pass.

He'd revert to his usual dismissive self, handing over the piece of Caleb's past without a second thought.

He was too self-absorbed to question it deeply.

They were in the car, on their way to one of Chloe's ""emergency""  fittings for a dress she needed for yet another event Ethan was bankrolling.

""That lawyer called earlier,""  Ethan said, not taking his eyes off the road. ""Peterson. What was that about? You didn't mention anything."" 

Ava kept her gaze fixed on the passing cityscape.

""It's handled, Ethan,""  she said quietly. ""Nothing for you to worry about."" 

He grunted. ""Good. Chloe's been stressed about this premiere. I don't need any other distractions."" 

His priorities, as always, were crystal clear.

Ava maintained her facade of quiet compliance.

She knew Ethan sometimes watched her when he thought she wasn't looking.

She'd see his reflection in the dark windows at night, his eyes narrowed, a thoughtful, almost puzzled expression on his face.

He was trying to understand the depth of her supposed love, her endless tolerance for his neglect and his blatant a**air with Chloe.

He couldn't comprehend it, because it wasn't real.

His inability to see the truth was her greatest ally.

They arrived at the boutique. Chloe Vance, all feigned sweetness and light, rushed out to greet Ethan, ignoring Ava completely.

""Ethan, darling! You're a lifesaver!""  Chloe gushed, throwing her arms around him.

Then, as if noticing Ava for the first time, Chloe's eyes, narrowed slightly. ""Oh, Ava. You came too."" 

Ava offered a small, polite smile. ""Ethan is so devoted to you, Chloe. Of course, I'd support him in supporting you."" 

A strange expression flickered across Ethan's face at her words. Discomfort? Annoyance?

He couldn't place it.

He quickly recovered, putting an arm around Chloe. ""Let's get this fitting done."" 

He turned to Ava. ""You can wait in the car. Or go get coffee. This will take a while."" 

Ava nodded, her expression placid. ""Alright, Ethan."" 

She watched him lead Chloe into the boutique, his attention entirely focused on the other woman.

He was already pulling out his wallet, no doubt to pay for whatever Chloe d**ired.

Ava turned and walked away, melting into the city crowds.

She had her own errands to run, her own memories to collect.

Chapter 3
Ethan's devotion to Chloe Vance became a public spectacle.

He was constantly by her side, showering her with lavish gifts, attending premieres and parties as her doting escort.

The tabloids lapped it up, splashing photos of ""Finance Magnate Ethan Hayes and His Aspiring Actress Muse Chloe Vance""  across their glossy pages.

Ava remained a footnote, the shadowy, neglected wife.

She saw the articles, heard the gossip from the staff. It didn't faze her.

Her focus was elsewhere, on the subtle changes in her body, the growing life within.

One evening, there was an alumni gala for their university, NYU. Ava had initially declined to attend, but Ethan, surprisingly, insisted.

""Chloe will be there,""  he'd said, as if that explained everything. ""It's important for her networking."" 

So, Ava found herself in a glittering ballroom, a silent observer once more.

She saw Chloe across the room, holding court, Ethan a smiling statue by her side.

Eventually, their paths crossed near the alumni archives display.

Chloe, spotting Ava, gave a bright, insincere smile. ""Ava! Fancy meeting you here. Ethan was just telling me how much he... enjoys these things.""  Her eyes flickered towards Ethan, a silent, possessive claim.

Ethan just nodded, his gaze fixed on Chloe.

""It's... nostalgic,""  Ava managed, her voice barely a whisper.

Chloe, oblivious to the undercurrents, or perhaps deliberately obtuse, gestured towards a faded photograph in a display case. It showed a group of students, younger, brighter. Among them, two identical faces.

""Oh, look!""  Chloe exclaimed. ""Isn't that... Caleb? Ethan's brother? The one who...?"" 

She trailed off, a delicate hand flying to her mouth. ""Oh, I'm so sorry, Ethan. How clumsy of me."" 

Then, turning to Ava, her eyes wide with feigned innocence, ""He was quite the artist, wasn't he? And didn't he have some intense college romance? I remember hearing whispers about it back then. Someone he was completely devoted to."" 

Ava felt the bl**d drain from her face. Her breath hitched. Caleb. His romance. Their romance.

Ethan, visibly annoyed at the mention of his late brother, cut in curtly. ""That was a long time ago, Chloe. Let's get some champagne."" 

He steered Chloe away, leaving Ava standing alone, her heart pounding, the ghost of Caleb suddenly overwhelmingly present.

Chloe glanced back, a small, triumphant smirk playing on her lips.

Later, during the seated dinner, Ethan catered exclusively to Chloe.

He ensured her favorite w**e was poured, selected dishes he knew she preferred from the curated menu, even discreetly signaled a waiter to bring her a specific brand of mineral water she favored.

Ava sat beside him, a ghost at the feast, picking at her food, the earlier mention of Caleb echoing in her mind.

The weight of her deception, her carefully constructed life, felt heavier than usual.

As the evening wore on, Ava excused herself, needing a moment of quiet.

She found a secluded alcove near the restrooms.

She heard voices from the ladies'lounge – Chloe's distinct, slightly shrill laugh, then her voice, lower, conspiratorial.

""He's completely wrapped around my little finger,""  Chloe was saying, presumably on the phone. ""A few tears, a whispered plea, and he'd buy me the moon. He thinks I'm so delicate, so dependent on him. Men are such fools for a damsel in distress."" 

Ava froze.

Chloe continued, ""As for the wife? Please. She's a doormat. Insignificant. He barely knows she exists. Once I get this next role, and he's set me up in that LA condo... well, let's just say Mrs. Hayes's days are numbered."" 

A cold amusement touched Ava's lips. So, the sweet, innocent Chloe was a calculating manipulator. It wasn't surprising.

Just then, the lounge door opened, and Chloe stepped out, phone still to her ear.

She saw Ava. Her eyes widened, then narrowed.

""How much did you hear?""  Chloe hissed, ending her call abruptly.

Ava simply looked at her, her expression unreadable.

""Don't think for a second you matter to him,""  Chloe spat, her voice venomous. ""He's mine. He'll always choose me."" 

Ava turned to leave. She had no interest in a confrontation.

But Chloe moved quickly, blocking her path.

""You think you're so clever, don't you? Playing the dutiful wife."" 

Chloe's heel caught on the plush carpet. Or she pretended it did.

She stumbled, grabbing onto Ava's arm, then yelped, collapsing dramatically onto the floor just as Ethan rounded the corner.

""Ava! What the h**l are you doing?""  Ethan roared, rushing to Chloe's side.

Chloe was already crying, clutching her ankle. ""She pushed me, Ethan! I just tried to talk to her, and she... she pushed me!"" 

Ethan's face was contorted with rage. He looked from Chloe, crumpled on the floor, to Ava, standing silently.

He didn't ask. He didn't hesitate.

""You b**ch!""  he snarled, and shoved Ava hard.

Ava, caught off guard, stumbled backward.

Behind her was a short flight of decorative marble stairs leading down to a lower landing.

She lost her footing, her arms flailing, and then she was falling, a sharp pain shooting through her back as she hit the steps.

""My baby,""  she gasped, clutching her stomach, terror washing over her. ""Ethan, help me... the baby..."" 

He stood at the top of the stairs, looking down at her, his face a mask of cold fury.

""You deserved that,""  he said, his voice devoid of any emotion but anger. ""Don't you ever touch Chloe again."" 

He turned and knelt beside Chloe, his voice instantly softening. ""Are you okay, darling? Let me see."" 

He didn't even glance back at Ava.

Pain, sharp and terrifying, ripped through her. She felt a warm wetness spreading beneath her.

""Help...""  she whispered, reaching out a hand, but he was already helping Chloe to her feet, his arm protectively around her.

The world started to spin. Darkness closed in.

She dreamt of Caleb.

He was sitting by a lake, sunlight dappling through the trees, his sketchbook open on his lap.

He smiled at her, that gentle, loving smile that always made her heart ache.

""Our baby will be beautiful, Ava,""  he whispered, his voice like a soothing balm. ""Just like you."" 

He reached for her hand, but his fingers passed right through hers.

She woke up with a g**p, the sterile smell of antiseptic filling her nostrils.

A hospital room. Bright lights.

A nurse was adjusting her IV drip. ""Well, look who's awake. You gave us quite a scare, dear."" 

The nurse's expression was stern. ""Tumbling down stairs like that... you're lucky. The baby is fine. For now. We'll need to monitor you closely."" 

Relief, so potent it was dizzying, washed over Ava. The baby was safe.

""Your husband... or partner?""  the nurse asked, her tone neutral.

Ava closed her eyes, the image of Caleb's smile still vivid.

""My love is already gone,""  she whispered, the words raw with a grief that Ethan would never understand.

Just then, the door burst open.

Ethan stood there, his face pale, his eyes wide.

He had clearly overheard her.

""What did you just say?""  he demanded, his voice tight. ""Your love is gone? What the h**l does that mean, Ava?""

Chapter 4
The nurse, a woman with kind eyes but a no-nonsense demeanor, stepped between them.

""Sir, please. She needs to rest.""  The nurse glanced from Ethan's furious face to Ava's pale one. ""You're her husband? She took a nasty fall. And at this stage of her pr**nancy..."" 

Ava's eyes snapped open, meeting the nurse's. ""Pr**nancy?"" 

She quickly looked at Ethan, whose expression was a mixture of confusion and dawning anger.

""I'm fine,""  Ava said quickly, trying to sit up. ""Just a little dizzy."" 

Ethan ignored the nurse, his gaze fixed on Ava's stomach, then her face.

""What is she talking about, Ava? Pr**nancy?"" 

Ava forced a weak smile. ""She must be mistaken. I just... I ate something that disagreed with me. My stomach has been a bit sensitive."" 

Ethan wasn't buying it, but Chloe's incident was still fresh in his mind.

His jaw tightened. ""This is your fault, you know. If you hadn't provoked Chloe..."" 

""I didn't provoke her, Ethan."" 

""She said you pushed her!"" 

""I didn't. There are cameras in the hallway. Check them."" 

Ethan scoffed. ""I don't need to check any cameras. I believe Chloe. She wouldn't lie.""  He crossed his arms. ""You're going to apologize to her."" 

Ava stared at him, a weary resignation settling in.

""No, Ethan. I won't apologize for something I didn't do."" 

His eyes narrowed. ""You will. Or I'll make your life even more miserable than it already is."" 

The threat hung in the air, ugly and familiar.

Ava closed her eyes. She was tired. So incredibly tired.

The baby. She had to protect the baby.

""Fine,""  she whispered. ""I'll apologize. Just... make this stop."" 

Ethan looked momentarily surprised by her quick capitulation, a flicker of something – doubt? – in his eyes. But it vanished as quickly as it came.

""Good."" 

Chloe was brought in a few minutes later, leaning heavily on a cane she clearly didn't need, her expression one of martyred suffering.

Ava delivered a flat, emotionless apology. ""I'm sorry, Chloe, if my actions caused you distress."" 

Chloe sniffed, dabbing at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. ""Well, I suppose I accept your apology, Ava. For Ethan's sake."" 

Ethan beamed at Chloe, then gave Ava a curt nod. He helped Chloe into a waiting wheelchair, and they left.

Ava was alone again.

During her recovery at home – a brief, mandated rest – the staff tiptoed around her.

She overheard their whispers, the endless praise for Ethan's ""devotion""  to Chloe, who was milking her ""injury""  for all it was worth.

""Mr. Hayes is so good to Miss Vance. He's barely left her side."" 

""He even spoon-fed her that special broth she likes."" 

Ava tuned it out. Her focus was inward, on the tiny life she was nurturing.

She meticulously followed her doctor's instructions, eating well, resting, taking her prenatal vitamins.

Before her discharge from the brief hospital observation, she'd had a final consultation with an obstetrician.

The doctor confirmed the baby was developing perfectly.

Then Ava asked a question that made the doctor pause.

""If identical twin brothers have children with different women... how similar would the children be? Genetically?"" 

The doctor, a kind woman in her fifties, looked at her curiously. ""Genetically, they would be half-siblings, sharing approximately 25% of their DNA, the same as if they shared one parent. In terms of appearance... it's possible they could bear a strong resemblance, as they'd inherit from fathers with identical genetic makeup. But many other factors are at play."" 

Ava nodded slowly. It was enough.

As she was leaving the hospital, dressed in loose, comfortable clothes, she nearly collided with Ethan and Chloe in the lobby.

Chloe, still playing the invalid, was being pushed in a wheelchair by a fawning Ethan.

""Ava!""  Chloe chirped, her voice falsely bright. ""Fancy meeting you here. I'm just getting a final check-up. You know, Ethan has been so worried.""  She patted Ethan's hand.

""We're having a small get-together at a friend's place tonight,""  Chloe continued, her eyes gleaming. ""Just a few close friends. You should come. It'll be... fun."" 

It wasn't an invitation; it was a command, thinly veiled. Ethan nodded in agreement. ""Yes, you should come."" 

Ava found herself at the party, a glass of water in her hand, watching Ethan dote on Chloe.

Chloe, ensconced on a plush sofa, held court, regaling the group with exaggerated tales of her ""ordeal."" 

Ethan hung on her every word, his adoration palpable.

Ava felt nothing. She was a spectator, detached, her mind on her own timeline.

Later, someone suggested a game of ""Truth or Dare."" 

The bottle spun, landing on Ava.

She chose ""Truth."" 

A smirking acquaintance of Chloe's asked the question, her eyes darting towards Ethan.

""Ava, darling, is the person you love most in this room?"" 

A hush fell over the small group. All eyes were on her. Ethan's gaze was intense, expectant.

Ava met his eyes, her expression calm, almost serene.

She smiled faintly.

""No,""  she said, her voice clear and steady. ""No, he's not.""

Actually, there's still a lot of work to do. I don't like how the night looks, but I like the basic picture I got. Stalker 2 is currently the most realistic game in terms of graphics. I think in a year or two we won't be able to distinguish graphics from reality.

I know this might sound like a long shot—maybe a one-in-a-million chance—but I’m a believer in taking risks when it feels right. 

Today, around 5:35-5:45 pm (give or take, since I was too distracted to check my phone), I was jogging near the Art Museum in Citadel Park, heading toward the corner with Charles de Kerchovelaan. That’s when I saw her: a stunning girl in a black dress and dark hair, riding her bike like she owned the breeze.
 
Our eyes met, and she flashed me a smile—one of those rare, electric smiles that lingers in your mind long after it’s gone. I was just a bearded guy in a black t-shirt and shorts, caught mid-run, completely unprepared for a moment like that. I was so swept up in it that I forgot to stop and say hi. By the time I snapped out of it, she’d vanished in the distance. I did another loop, hoping for a second chance, but no luck. 

So, if you’re reading this and you’re the girl in the black dress with that unforgettable smile, please reach out! I’d love to chat—maybe over a coffee?—and see where that moment could take us. 

And to everyone else in this awesome community: if you could help me spread the word or share this post, I’d be beyond grateful. Let’s see if we can turn a fleeting glance into something more. Who knows? Maybe we can make this big world feel a little smaller together.

BUT, what does daily life look like for the average person?

Obviously, people still need to eat and wear clothes and pay bills. In the classics, you see dozens of asian inspired restaurants and eateries lining the neon and rain soaked streets.  so the people that own / operate the restaurants are just ""doing the daily grind"" and going to work every day and making noodles and buns and pouring drinks.  they still have to take out the garbage and wash the dishes, right? so there must still be garbage men and waste handling facilities.

and you see all the clothing, oversized, synthetic & transparent materials, lights interwoven into the fabric. shoes, boots, umbrellas & rain coats.  well, someone has to make all that stuff right?  and people have to buy it.  so there must still be shopping centers and clothing stores.  

in apartments, you see furniture and video monitors, kitchen cabinets, coffee makers, tables & chairs.  beds top sleep on and couches to sit and stare out the window.  so there must be furniture stores or manufacturers.

cars are still driving around and guys riding bikes & pulling rickshaws.  

so despite all the terrible cyber tech and corporations, the tasks and necessities of ""normal life"" have to still be around. Not EVERYONE is a cyber-criminal or Corporate A-hole... right?? some folks gotta be out there just trying to get by and make a living, even in a terrible cyberpunk world.

So how come none of this is ever discussed in cyberpunk fiction?  we always see sprawling neon cities and stacked cubicle apartments and floating cities.  aren't there any farms out in the country anymore??

A few years in the PNW, Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado now for several years (our favorite so far). But I recently got a remote job that’s going to help us financially a lot and we’re no longer tied down to the West specifically (my previous role revolved around me being in more expensive mountain areas). 

We’re mountain people. We hike, fly-fish, backpack, and I trail run every week. We like small towns and avoid touristy areas. We don’t need big epic mountains, but we love dense forests and I personally like challenging hikes or runs in the mountains. We really fit in here in Colorado but it’s tough to consider buying such an expensive kind of crappy home when we could move elsewhere and get much more value.

We LOVE the cold and don’t enjoy it getting above 80 degrees. We like communities and mountain culture centered around being outdoorsy. We love a good coffee shop and vegetarian food spots. While we love winters, we actually don’t ski or snowboard yet. And we love small town-living. The most important thing we’ll sacrifice leaving CO is the sunshine (the PNW moodiness affected me in the winter at times).

Just looking for a more affordable place that’s maybe not as epic as Colorado but is more affordable and low-key. Just looking for suggestions and opinions from others. Thanks for any input! ",6,1751477290.0,SameGrassButGreener,19,1.0,False

Haye, doston, Coorg ke woh do din mere dil mein ek sapne jaisa yaad banke reh gaye! 😍 Hum dono ne in do din mein itna ghuma, itna hasa, aur itna pyar kiya ki lagta tha jaise duniya ki saari khushiyan bas humare liye hi bani thi. 🌿 Bhaiya aur main Coorg ke coffee plantations mein haath mein haath daale ghumte, chhoti chhoti waterfalls ke paas baith ke baatein karte, aur kabhi kabhi jab koi nahi hota tha, toh woh mujhe apne paas kheench ke ek chhupa sa kiss dete. 😘 Har pal mein ek alag si masti thi, ek alag sa junoon. Hum dono ke beech romance ka toofan sa utha hua tha—kabhi woh mujhe apni godi mein utha lete, kabhi main unke baalon mein ungliyan ferte hue unki aankhon mein kho jati. 💖

Aur haan, woh raatein… haye, woh toh bilkul alag hi thi! 😈 Room ke andhere mein, candlelight ke neeche, bhaiya mujhe apni baahon mein bhar lete, aur hum dono ek doosre mein itna kho jate ki waqt ka pata hi nahi chalta. 😍 Kabhi woh meri kamar ko sehlate, kabhi meri neck pe kisses ki bauchhaar karte, aur kabhi meri boobs ko itne pyar se chhute ki main bas unmein hi dub jati. 😶 Hum dono ke beech ek ajeeb si chemistry thi—thodi si forbidden, thodi si wild, aur bohot sara pyar. Har baar jab woh mujhe apne paas kheenchte, mera dil bolta, “Sheetal, yeh kya kar rahi hai?” Par fir unki aankhon mein dekhti, aur sab doubts pighal jate. 😘

Ek din, jab hum ek chhote se viewpoint pe baith ke Coorg ke sunset ko dekh rahe the, maine bhaiya se ek serious sa sawal pucha. 😳 Main unke kandhe pe sir rakhe leti hui thi, aur dheere se boli, “Bhaiya, aapne toh hamesha se plan banaya tha na, mere saath… yeh sab karne ka?” 😶 Unhone ek lambi saans li, aur fir meri taraf dekhte hue kaha, “Haan, Sheetal. Main kab se tujhe sochta tha. Tera yeh smile, tera yeh figure… tu meri dil ki dhadkan ban gayi thi.” 😍 Unki awaaz mein ek sincerity thi, par maine fir pucha, “Toh fir aapne us raat mujhe force kyun kiya? Woh toh rape tha, bhaiya!” 😣 Mera dil thoda bhari ho gaya tha, aur aankhon mein thodi si nami aa gayi.

Bhaiya ka chehra ekdum serious ho gaya. Unhone mera haath pakad ke kaha, “Sheetal, meri jaan, maine tujhe kabhi hurt karne ka nahi socha. Mera koi bura intention nahi tha. Bas… tujhe pyar karna chahta tha, aur us moment mein main khud ko rok nahi paya. I’m so sorry.” 😔 Unki aankhon mein guilt aur pyar ka ek ajeeb sa mix tha, aur unhone meri ungliyon ko dheere se sehlate hue kaha, “Tu meri liye kitni special hai, tujhe kabhi nahi pata.” Maine sharma ke kaha, “Bhaiya, aap bhi na… par yeh sab theek hai kya? Hum cousins hain.” 😶

Woh thodi der chup rahe, fir bole, “Sheetal, shayad yeh samaj ke hisaab se galat hai. Par jab hum dono ke dil ek doosre ke liye dhadakte hain, jab hume ek doosre ke saath itna sukoon milta hai, toh kya galat hai? Tu khush hai na mere saath?” 😘 Maine dheere se sar hilaya, aur kaha, “Haan, bhaiya, mujhe yeh sab… bohot accha laga.” 😍 Hum dono ne ek doosre ko dekha, aur fir ek lambi, pyaar bhari hug mein simat gaye. Us moment mein laga jaise duniya ki koi fikar hi nahi thi—bas hum dono aur humara yeh chhota sa sapna.

Fir hum Bangalore ke liye wapas nikle. 😢 Raste mein bhaiya ne itni mastiyan ki ki hum bilkul boyfriend-girlfriend jaisa behave kar rahe the! 😜 Woh kabhi bike rok ke mujhe apne paas kheenchte, kabhi meri kamar pe haath rakhte, aur kabhi meri thighs pe dheere se pinch karte. Maine hanste hue kaha, “Bhaiya, yeh kya, road pe hi shuruaat kar doge?” 😈 Woh bole, “Arre, meri Sheetal ke saath toh har jagah maza aata hai!” 😘 Rasta ekdum filmy lag raha tha—thandi hawa, bhaiya ki flirty baatein, aur hum dono ke beech woh pyaar bhari chemistry.

Jab hum Bangalore pahunche, toh bhaiya ne mujhe mere PG ke bahar chhoda. Agle din unki flight thi, aur jab woh mujhe goodbye bolne aaye, toh meri aankhon mein aansu aa gaye. 😢 Unhone mujhe gale lagane ke liye kaha, par maine sharma ke mana kar diya, “Bhaiya, yahan koi dekh lega! Aap mere cousin ho, meri friends ko pata chalega toh kya bolengi?” 😳 Woh ek pyaari si smile dete hue bole, “Theek hai, meri jaan, par dil se dil tak toh hum hamesha connected rahenge na?” 😍 Maine sar hilaya, par dil ekdum bhari ho gaya.

Us din main bohot sad thi. Bhaiya ki yaad har pal satati thi—unki woh naughty hasi, unka mujhe pyar se chhuna, unki woh intense aankhein. 😶 Par jab woh apne city pahunch gaye, toh unhone mujhe call kiya aur kaha, “Sheetal, tu meri wajah se itni sad kyun hai? Main toh hamesha tere dil mein hoon!” 😘 Humne kafi baatein ki, aur har baat mein woh pyar aur masti bhari thi. Par ek din maine unse serious hoke kaha, “Bhaiya, hame thodi si doori rakhni chahiye. Agar hum itne attached rahe, toh jab humari life mein koi aur aayega, toh problems hongi.” 😔

Bhaiya thodi der chup rahe, fir bole, “Sheetal, tu sahi kehti hai. Par yeh dil ka connection toh hamesha rahega na? Hum milte rahenge, pyar karte rahenge, aur ek doosre ka khayal rakenge.” 😍 Maine kaha, “Haan, bhaiya, yeh promise hai. Aap meri life ka ek special part ho, hamesha rahoge.” 😘 Dheere dheere humne baatein kam ki, par har baar jab woh call karte ya message karte, mera dil fir se unki yaad mein doob jata. Humne ek agreement kiya—hum milte rahenge, ek doosre se pyar karte rahenge, par apni apni life ko bhi sambhalenge.

Coorg ka yeh safar mere dil pe ek gehri chhap chhod gaya. 😶 Bhaiya aur main—humara yeh rishta shayad samaj ke rules se bahar tha, par dil ke rules se toh bilkul perfect tha. 💖 Ab aage kya hoga, yeh soch ke dil dhadakta hai, par ek baat pakki hai—bhaiya meri zindagi ka woh chapter hain jo main kabhi nahi bhoolungi. 😘

i’ve had a couple of asks for my deceased husband’s items. context: he died 7 months ago, we don’t have children. i am all alone now. he was sick for years, a slow and sad death. he was 39, as was i. i’m now 40. anyway. one was an uncle (i partially take it with a grain of salt) but symbolically is one of many people who weren’t around for him nor me during years of sickness. im still feeling anger about the people who abandoned my husband (and me!) for years when he got sick. 
the day after he died, he messaged me saying i’m so sorry i loved him. can i have the XYZ thing of his? gross. i said i haven’t gone through his stuff yet but when i do i’ll see. and left it at that. 
recently, my mil (love her and we are close and supportive of each other immensely) commented that there’s a step grandkid struggling with the loss (it’s not that, i don’t feel, his grandpa is also dying of lung failure rn) and that she wondered if he could have one of my husband’s hats or something. this stuck with me and triggered me. 
the ONLY shit of my husband’s that i have gone through was 74 boxes of dialysis fluids i had to single-handedly cut open and dispose of. and i only pushed myself to do that because that and medical supplies took up a ton of room in our basement living area and i had family coming to stay with me from england for his celebration of life in feb. and needed to set the area up for them. 

my garage still has 50 boxes of med supplies, wheeelchairs, other equipment, IV poles. my house is packed of shit from years of me working 50+ hours a week and trying to care for my husband. his clothes are still folded and hung up in his space he lived in. his phone still sits on my coffee table. i have touched zero of his things yet, and i don’t feel bad i will get there eventually. i’ve been episodically enraged over the feeling that people want to come pick shit off of his when i can barely keep my dogs fed and my lawn mowed, let alone i haven’t gone through any of it and decided what i want to keep for ME or just need to keep in general. i’m also annoyed with myself bc when mil asked about the hat i said sure probably ok. if she asks again i know what to say. 

i also know it’s triggering a part of me that feels like “what about ME. my grief. my loneliness and sadness???!!!!”
everyone i love, and they’ve been so kind to me, HAS SOMEONE. i’m jealous. i’m envious. i’m lonely. not all the time, but learning to rebuild a life in a pit of destruction and despair is challenging. they have kids and spouses and each other and a home that’s not packed full of a life that has tragically ended. the thought of them being happily comforted then returning to their lovely home with their people while i sit home and dispense his precious items triggers tf out of me right now. the uncle’s message is now restricted and unread. idgaf truly and have choice words if anyone presses me. i will snarl at them. 

UGH. ppl don’t tend to think of the impact of their words and i know typically people don’t mean harm. but fucking OUCH OK. 
leave me tf alone. it just makes me angry. i’m saddled with 3 loans for my husband’s medical debt to the tune of 35k left to pay, a house that needs repairs and remodeling, let alone cleaning it tf out, but SURE lemme show up for you and provide you comfort. when my reality is every day i go home after work and avoid walking in the front door bc the house is empty and im overwhelmed.

It all started with a chair. One single bistro chair — deceptively innocent, rattan-backed, sun-kissed — sitting just slightly too close to the doorway of a café somewhere in Montmartre. I had arrived in [**Paris**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parisian_caf%C3%A9) that morning with dreams of café crème, flaky pastry, and making meaningful eye contact with a stranger across a zinc counter. Instead, I ended up receiving a death glare from a woman in a silk scarf who, I later realized, had been mentally reserving that very table since 1973.

Welcome to café culture [**in France,**](https://www.inlovewiththemed.com/enchante-bonjour-from-france-must-see-destinations-for-2024/) where the table you choose is not just a matter of availability. It’s a declaration of mood, purpose, personality, and, if you’re not careful, public allegiance.

# The Café as a Stage — and You’re the Main Act

French cafés are not mere places to drink coffee. They are living theatres where everyone — and I do mean everyone — is performing. The man with the cigar and the copy of Le Figaro? He wants to be seen, but not disturbed. The girl tapping her cigarette ash into a saucer while wearing oversized sunglasses? She’s auditioning for a Godard film that hasn’t been made yet. The older couple with the poodle and matching navy blazers? They’ve been sitting at that exact table since Pompidou.

And then there’s you. You, the outsider. The amateur. You sit wherever you like — and instantly reveal everything.

One of those feelings of if ya know ya know
But lately I've been freaking out mentally. There's been a few issues and my mind sometimes jumps to ending it because honestly I feel like I'm the issue a lot of times but my therapist is validating everything I say and feel too. I know 3 months is a short time to have issues but being in unhealthy relationships for so long can make the healthy one feel crazy. 

I guess my biggest concern lately is that he has a female( 26) friend who is married and they used to work together. We all work for the same company still but different locations. But it just seems like their friendship doesnt have a lot of boundaries, for example they hang out one on one a lot if her husband works late. I guess she doesn't like spending time alone, and she may be upset i dont trust her, (which i dont) She has no problem talking about her sex life to everyone. The few times I've hung out with them I've felt like a 3rd wheel to their friendship. And she complained about feeling like a 3rd wheel to our relationship... but she is. I understand there's conversations to be had to include everyone when hanging out which was something I lacked on because i only feel comfortable with my bf right now. But same goes for her where they talk a lot about things im not included in.  She makes snarky comments that almost seem like a jab at me or an attachment to my bf for example playing game name night. Couples are teams. Teams are losing and she said we should switch teams next time so we can win. Meaning she would be on a team with my bf Meanwhile this is my 3rd time hanging out with them. 

My bf is very supportive and validates what I say too. He has since set boundaries that I've asked as far as not having out one on one. Not talking about our sex life. I considered getting coffee with this friend but I'm concerned if I do I'll be shot down and however she feels should be fine, ""like why can't they hang out alone they are just friends."" I would totally be okay with things if I was more comfortable with her but the few times we hung out its just been making me feel worse. I am getting major anxiety thinking about future hang outs we have planned. I feel bad that I'm taking my bf away from his friend. She mentioned feeling like a 3rd wheel on one occasion, and said her and her husband never make him feel like that. It's just rough because this friendship is 2plus years old and I'm brand new to this relationship and im constantly feeling like an outsider. They have a group chat called throuple. I also feel a little crazy cuz it seems like im the only one who sees an issue with things. Her husband is fine with them being friends. I understand guys and girls emotions are different. I think that's my concern too I dont know her motives but I haven't been able to get to know her either because im excluded. Is there a better or different way to handle this situation without putting up walls and avoiding them, and taking him away from his friends?

So the guy I’ve been dating for a few months went on vacation the past month. It was kind of rough dating for a short time, only to have him leave for month and do the long distance thing for a bit. (For reference, I am a 36yo female, he is 40yo male)

When he got back, he invited me to coffee. I was excited to see him and met him at the coffee shop. When it was time to order, he kind of hung back and let me pay for the both of us.

I don’t mind paying for things, and have paid for my fair share of things while dating him. However, after not seeing him for so long, it felt ‘off’ for him not to make the gentlemanly gesture to pay.

Am I overreacting? Am I expecting too much, is it not a big deal?

But I don’t get the adults who claim that real curse words feel “too Earthly” and should be entirely replaced with “Star Wars” ones.

Canonically, what we hear is a direct translation of Galactic Basic Standard, hence we understand the vocabulary; if we share “hello,” we share “shit.” Simple.

The so-called “Star Wars swears” are just words from alien languages, like Huttesse. A Basic Galactic Standard speaker saying “poodoo” is like an English speaker randomly yelling “Scheiße”.

Cringe factor aside, it just doesn’t make sense in-universe.

As for the claim that “real” swearing never existed in Star Wars before: that was just because of the kid-friendly ratings. Now that the audience range is finally expanding, they can leave the “poodoos” in kid media and let adults speak like normal people, in my opinion.",0,1751476658.0,andor,17,0.39,False

I’m (24F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been dating for almost two years now. He had dated lots of girls and had hook ups before while I before him, had never been in a relationship due to personal reasons. 

He admitted to me a few times that he had thought about cheating on previous partners but had never done it, but assured me he had never had any thoughts about cheating on me. 

I thought this was kind of odd to bring up but I didn’t really mind as I wanted an honest relationship and we had discussed things like this from start. 

Our relationship was going really well until last week, I was on his phone as we are very open about that kind of thing and noticed a new app which I could tell wasn’t the actual calculator. 

I opened it and found a messaging app, and saw at least twenty other women he was talking too. I was obviously shocked and did read through these messages and found some slightly flirtatious ones but mainly friendly but there was one girl at the top which was definitely more than platonic. 

I read through the messages of that girl that started only a few weeks ago, and found out that they had met up and exchanged nudes prior. I have no real proof they actually slept together or did anything but this freaked me out. So I asked him about it. 

He was very honest and said that he had met up with her to go for coffee but realised how weird it was and after only a few minutes, he left. 

I felt horrible but he kept going and told me the girl he was speaking to was 16! In our country it would be legal for them to do anything but omg it freaked me out. 

He had always said he preferred younger girls and how it was kind of strange for him to be dating me as I’m older but I didn’t really care. 

I told him that I felt really bad about him meeting with a 16 year old girl for what could have led to sex while I was dating him and he argued back and that lasted the entire night. 

I slept over at my parents for the night, and in the morning I got a call from his dad who I’m really close with asking if I was okay as my boyfriend had told him that we had fought. 

Originally, I was going to say nothing as I knew his parents would hate him from now on and I didn’t want that to happen as they had such a great relationship but it all came rushing out. 

I told his dad about EVERYTHING and his dad started crying and hung up. 

It’s been a day since then and I have no idea 
what to do. I think I did the right thing but I’m not sure. 

Advice greatly appreciated.

The process of making it is like no other tea, and the taste is so comforting, that’s what makes it so desirable, perhaps by much of the west that have led to such massive popularity. I have never understood the outrage people even have towards the uprise in matcha and everyone loving it, because it’s not like the average person stepping into a coffee shop is putting that much thought into the ethics that go behind ordering a matcha latte. Or even purchasing some cheap matcha at the grocery store to put it in their smoothies or make their own milk and sugar matcha concoction. I mean, people can do what they want. I am a bit of a tea snob myself, but I’m not about to jump on other people for how they personally prepare their tea or any drinks or food that THEY consume.

1lq1kam,https://i.redd.it/7z5w0fcophaf1.jpeg,"🍉🪦🏳️‍🌈quick review of Little & Grim (mostly Pride scents, some GC)","Quick turnaround time, no issues with my order. Packaged safely. I was too late to get several of the Pride 2025 scents (sold out) but I did get 1, and then there were the returning ones from last year.   


TL;DR -- **Little & Grim might be becoming my favorite house for lighter scents**. A lot of the time I find lighter scents go too sweet on me (often the case with florals), or are very faint. These all have good longevity, and are very true to their scent descriptions. 5 out of the 6 below are perfect summer scents for me. 

  
**☕Compton's Coffee (Pride 2025 collection):** just like it says on the tin, goes on solidly half black coffee and half patch. I don't know if I know the best ways to distinguish different patches. When people use ""chewy"" as a descriptor, I usually think of ""crunchy"", as in hippie-ish. I suppose it's more on that end, rather than a ""clean"" patch (which I think of as the white patch Poesie used in ""Dank Ghost""). But it's not stanky to me.  I like it a lot, though the coffee does fade for the most part after about 1-2 hrs.  


**🌲Hi Gay, I'm Dad** (Pride 2024 returning): this is such a ""friendly"" masc, if that makes sense. it's not heavy and aggressive, just gently avuncular. I texted my friend ""very light bright and summery""  


**🛩️They Were Co-Captains** ***(****Pride 2024 returning):* f in the chat🪦the only one I didn't like. That's on me though, it clearly has ""cake accord"" as a note. [I wrote about it for IotD here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1lk3lx8/comment/mzq5cen/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**🐾Actual Cryptid** *(Pride 2024 returning):* also good, I probably need to come back with more notes. lmk if you want my thoughts.   


**🌾Noonwraith** *(Slavic Myths collection):* The 1st of the scents I FSed after a previous sample ordered, and the scent that really revealed to me my love of cypress. Considering it is inspired by Slavic myths, it is very funny to me that this smells so reminiscent to me of growing up in north central Florida. My notes from when I sampled:  *""smells like warm sunshine in a field of grass almost ready for harvest -- getting the cypress the best I ever have from any scent so far; so much a strong Florida cypress smell ""*  


**🐺Beast of Bray Road** *(Cryptid Tea Party collection)* the 2nd of the ones I'd previously sampled. My thoughts from then: *""at first, smells like sucking on a river rock, mineralic and cool. Then cedar and soil emerge, some spice from the patchouli. ""*

Some say to stop supplements 48–72h before for cleaner results, but wouldn't stopping give an artificial picture? I want to see what my body looks like under normal daily intake, not after a detox.

Is stopping just 24h enough? Or should I stay on everything to reflect my real-life baseline?

My gyn started me on HRT last year (a Liletta IUD that releases a progestin hormone and estradiol patch), and initially it mostly controlled the hot flashes. They started again this winter (got some relief from standing outside barefoot in the snow, like a very normal person). My gyn moved me up on the estradiol patch, from .05 to .075, which didn't help much, but she wanted to wait to see me in person to make further adjustments. Now I am having at least a dozen a day, very frequent and embarassing, my face and body just pouring down sweat. I live in a climate that is hot and humid in the summer, and it is so uncomfortable and distracting. I basically feel like I have a fever all the time, with wicked brain fog and low energy. I am embarrassed to go to my favorite weightlifting class because I sweat so much on the equipment; I was hesitant to serve dinner at our local food pantry because I didn't want to be a sweaty mess.

I don't notice that stress or caffeine triggers my hot flashes.

Super long one, beware lol I can answer any questions

I've been with my partner for about 4.5 years and things are just so different than where we started. For like 2 years things were great; we only playfully argued, bedroom life was unbelievable, we got along splendidly. We have different houses so we didn't live together during that time. Then he sort of asked me to live with him? 2 years later I stay at his house but still have my entire home where 95% of my belongings are, including my pets (low maintenance, they are in great health and the kind of pets that don't care about me at all, and I go to my house every day). 

After I started sleeping at his place I noticed he would tell me everything I do is wrong; I loaded the dishwasher the wrong way, I unloaded it the wrong way, my things on the counter are always in his way, leaving odds and ends in the living room is wrong, I fold towels wrong. I started doing things his way, and did my best to keep my stuff out of his way. But my mental health has been struggling for a while, due to family issues and whatnot, and my environment started to reflect it. I'm 80HD and can sometimes fall out of my systems when I'm depressed and fall behind on things like folding laundry and washing dishes. I admit, it can get cluttery sometimes. On some of my worst weeks I had a coffee cup become sentient. He started heavily berating me for these things, saying I'm gross and everyone would agree that functioning adults ""just do it"". He says that he's expressed how he feels about things (ex. leaving earrings and journals, etc on the end table) and because I continue to do it means I don't care about him. But I do care about him, I'm not being messy on purpose. I have systems to help me, but he didn't like them so I don't really know what other things to try. For example, I know I hate washing dishes, so my solution is to rinse the dish really quickly, even with soap if I have to, then when I can I pop them in the dishwasher to be sanitized. So sometimes I'll have practically clean dishes in the sink for a few days. I know that sounds gross but they don't grow anything or stink. I also will keep gloves on the sink and make sure the sponge is clean and not stinky. He has thrown away my gloves because he said they were in the way, he doesn't care about rinsing off the sponge, and he doesn't want me to leave rinsed dishes in the sink. 

I have tried really hard to express how I'm struggling, and asked for help. At one point I outright said that I'm on the ledge and asked for some grace but he didn't really respond. I know my mental health isn't his job, so I'm doing things to help my self. I see multiple therapists, out of pocket; one for general life, one for bereavement, and another care team for ADHD. I try and read articles and google different things to try and be better. But for some things I'm not sure what I should have done differently. I bought a new car and my old car was parked in front of his house; I was having issues because I couldn't get it to start, couldn't even find my keys, and there were zero tow trucks available. I communicated this with him every step of the way but one day he said I was making excuses and if I cared about him enough I'd just find a way to get it done. He said he was tired of looking at it and wanted to just let someone steal it. I wasn't trying to make excuses, I genuinely saw those things as roadblocks. I ended up paying a tow guy extra to prioritize my car and get it moved to my house.

I've been doing so much worse mentally over the last year, and it impacted my work. I've recently had some pretty big life changes for the worse and am not doing well. I am doing my best to upkeep his home, I vacuum twice a week and sweep in between, I detailed the whole house (which included moving a lot of his things to safe places around his desk) to have friends over for his birthday, and I pick up and tidy on a daily basis. He still says the house is a mess; it can be a bit cluttery sometimes but its not just my stuff. I'm really trying my hardest to stay organized and do the things he wants me to do but he still always seems so annoyed at me and doesn't really even talk to me. Our bedroom is completely ded, has been for like a year. I feel so stuck and like I am just not good enough, bottom line. I also worry I'm being manipulative or something, like I really am one of those partners that just doesn't care, even when asked multiple times to help out around the house. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to get my shit together and be better. And also suggestions on how to open up the bedroom again, if anyone has experienced anything like this. I really am trying so hard, I don't know why I can't just like be a normal girlfriend.",2,1751476031.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

What I currently have:
Nintendo Switch Lite – Hyrule Edition (hcked) (mint)

PS Vita 1000 OLED – modded

No working laptop or desktop

My long-term goal is to get a Steam Deck and build content around it — focused on fun, time-efficient games, tier lists, performance tests, and game curation. I'm already setting up my pages and branding, but I need at least a working laptop (~$140–$170 USD) to manage:

• Buy Me a Coffee (or similar)

• Game reviews and short-form content (YouTube Shorts, TikToks)

• General productivity until the Deck arrives

Should I trade the Switch Lite (maybe even the Vita) now to get a decent laptop and start the content side ASAP?

Or wait it out, keep the handhelds, and delay things until I can afford both the Deck and a laptop later?

I still have access to games (via modded platforms and PC alternatives), so it's not about losing play access — more about whether it’s smart to sacrifice gaming now to build something bigger around the Steam Deck later.

The conversation just flowed so well. Our interests aligned pretty much perfectly. For over a week, we chatted every single day and there were often less than a 30-35 minute wait between messages, given a couple of longer waits since one of us was busy. The conversation never felt dry or like it was running out of steam. About 3 days in, we set up a date for the coming Friday. He picked the coffee place, but he did warn me that he would be down for Friday, but there is a chance he would get called into work. So then came Thursday. He got called into work, so I proposed we do Saturday and he was down. We continued to talk through Thursday and on Friday, we started to bring up the date again and we decided to meet up around 12:30 p.m. the next day. I wake up Saturday morning to a message from him saying he is not ready to put himself out there again and he had to cancel at the last minute. The wave of frustration that was over me was immediately because on his profile, he indicated that he was looking for a long-term relationship. Like, if you're not ready, then just indicate it on your profile. I did respond saying I would be down to give it another shot in the future when he was ready and he responded that sounds wonderful. But even with that, I really liked him because I’ve never had someone that at least through text, we just vibed so well and messed well in conversation. And now I don’t know what to do because I can't get him out of my head and I keep asking myself what if he never did like me and this was his way of saying that? Thoughts?

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.
I’m a massive fiction reader. Love disappearing into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I’ll get back into reading history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.
Currently dipping in and out of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.
I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after — all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.
As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? 🤣
Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?
Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully along the way, sparks fly and find us.
Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes?
If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already.",1,1751475891.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

“Yes, I absolutely feel confident connecting with people. I’ve always been a people person. It’s… such an important part of life. Connections.”

I’m lying. He knows it. I know it. But we both smile along and go with it. That’s the appropriate thing to do.

“And you’d feel confident asking strangers for donations?”

“Of course. It’s not like I’m selling unnecessary things to the elderly. This is for real charities. For forests. For wildlife.”

Another man sits down across from me. A perfect duplicate of the first. His tie falls into his tea as he sits. He looks at me. Then at the tea. Then dips the tie deeper.

He asks me the same questions now.

Is this a test? It’s an interview, sure. But a test?

No one has touched their tea but me. And now I drink theirs too.

“And why do you want to work with us specifically?”

I refuse to acknowledge this new man. He didn’t introduce himself. An attempt to catch me off guard? I refuse to engage.

Instead, I look past him at the coffee shop walls. Wood paneling below a pastel wash — a color I don’t recognize. A new color.

There’s a sickle now at the table. No one mentions it.

Silence. Only broken by the dragging scrape of a chair.

A third identical man pulls a brown armchair from another table. He sits. He dips his tie.

“How well do you think you can deal with rejection? Because it will happen. A lot.”

I keep staring at the wall. A portrait leans in the corner of the room. I stare at it. Wondering when it would be appropriate to drink this man’s tea.

I finish their tea. No dwelling on it. Confidence is key.

A fourth man is now at the table. His chair made no sound as he pulled it across the small, unfamiliar coffee table. He’s identical still. But it’s old now.

Tie in tea. I know. I embarrass myself with a gasp. We are floating maybe a foot off the ground. I refuse to acknowledge it further.

“We offer a hybrid workplace system,” says the first man, sitting directly in front of me. “Three days a week working from home. Two days, Wednesday and Thursday in the office.”

“Yeah, that’s… incredible. That’s actually something I’ve been looking for. Allows for a better work-life balance. It fits really well with… my life.”

The men are now standing on their chairs, looking down at me, as if they were never sitting at all.

I look up at them. They look down at me.

I see now there’s no roof to the coffee shop. Just blue sky.

I finish the fourth man’s tea.

I am told I have won their ties. The men move as one, in perfect, mechanical unison, removing their ties and gently throwing them onto me.

I now wear four ties. It’s not professional attire. It’s not a good look for an interview. But I have four ties.

It dawns on me only now the portrait has none. I make a note to remember to give it one before I leave. And I’ll apologize for it being dipped in tea.

I haven’t got the job. But I have their ties.

I wanted to share some real-world advice for anyone dreaming about opening their own [car wrap](https://www.autostyleppf.com/ppf), [paint protection film](https://www.autostyleppf.com/), or **window tinting** shop.

When I started, I didn’t know half of this — so here’s what I wish someone told me:

# ✅ 1. Location does matter… at first.

When you’re new, a good spot brings you foot traffic and trust. Easy to find, safe parking — all important. But over time? Your **reputation** is everything. Loyal clients will drive to you if your work is solid.

# ✅ 2. Don’t cheap out on flooring & lighting.

I put down a nice plastic tile floor — easy to clean, looks pro, and keeps the shop safe. Bright lights on the ceiling are a must — you *need* to see every edge, bubble, or scratch.

# ✅ 3. You’ll need an office setup.

One computer, a printer, good design/cutting software, and a clean space to talk with clients. Simple but necessary.

# ✅ 4. Waiting room = extra points.

Some people stay for 1–2 hours while you tint their car. Give them a TV, coffee, soda, snacks — it makes you stand out.

# ✅ 5. Real tools make your life easy.

A plotter ($3K–$8.5K) saves you so much time and waste. Add plotter software ($200–$450/month). Get a wall rack for vinyl rolls — looks clean and makes the job faster. Also: a power washer, polishers, and all the prep gear.

# ✅ 6. Stock up in advance.

You can’t run out of tint or PPF mid-job. Have multiple rolls ready — matte, gloss, black, carbon, ceramic films — they’re expensive ($1,200–$1,800 per roll for PPF) but worth it.

# ✅ 7. Keep the place secure.

Luxury cars need protection. I installed multiple cameras inside & out, solid locks, alarm system, secure overnight parking.

# ✅ 8. Make payments easy.

Have a credit card machine and a safe for cash. The smoother you handle payments, the happier everyone is.

# 💡 Final Thoughts

If you plan these basics first, you’ll look more professional and avoid so many headaches. That’s how we built **Auto Style PPF** — today, our clients come from Sugar Grove, Naperville, Aurora, Batavia, and St. Charles for [wraps](https://www.autostyleppf.com/services), PPF & tints they trust.

If anyone wants to chat about opening their own shop or has questions about **tools**, **plotters**, **PPF**, or **window tint** — drop a comment! I’m always happy to share what I’ve learned.

**Transform. Protect. Enhance.**

1-CarPlay. 

“Why is there glitter in my seat?” Dylan asks dusting it off his hands. 
“I don’t know, Dylan. Maybe because you can’t stay away from cheap strip clubs with massive neon signs that flash girls, girls, girls .” Sam says playfully. 
Jacob laughed, glancing at Dylan through the rearview mirror. 
“I’m far too high brow for that, I found a new place with L.E.D’s that read women, women, women” Dylan grinned, tossing his dark curls off his forehead and slipping on his sunglasses with dramatic flair. His jawline was razor-sharp, and he had that kind of easy handsomeness that made people think he’d just stepped out of a lifestyle ad. His hoodie was too short, by design, exposing just enough of his toned stomach to make it obvious he knew exactly what he was doing.
“Ah yes” Jacob began “what’s it called again… Daddy issues?” The car erupts in laughter.
“Seriously… why is there glitter in your car?” He asks again.
“Eli got me on of those exploding cards for valentines day, I thought I got it all but it gets everywhere” Jacob nsaid rolling his eyes and shaking his head.
Adam groaned from the passenger seat. “Why does it always have to be a cabin in the woods”
He rubbed a hand through his thick, parted brown hair, the kind that flopped a little when he turned his head. Clean-shaven, broad-shouldered, with the crisp look of someone who had once considered been a boy scout but got distracted by beer, girls and sarcasm. His grey shirt was rolled at the sleeves, revealing a tan that perfectly coated his skin.
“Because I need to be off grid for a few days” Jacob admitted. “But not because I’m heartbroken, okay?”
Sam leaned forward between the seats, his boyish face alight with mischief. His light brown hair was short and slightly tousled, and he wore a faded vintage band tee like someone who’d actually gone to the concert. There was a sincerity to his eyes, like he hadn’t yet figured out the world was trying to crush him — and probably wouldn’t believe it if you told him.
“Sure. You just want to sit around a fire and not talk about Eli for three days.”
Jacob exhaled slowly. He was the one driving, hands tight on the wheel but relaxed just enough to look casual. His short-cropped dirty blonde hair was slightly windblown from the window being cracked open, and he had a square jaw and green eyes that looked thoughtful even when he was making jokes. Built like a former quarterback turned mechanic — rugged, understated, and maybe a little older in spirit than he was in years.
“I don’t miss him,” he said. “I just… feel bad. He wasn’t a bad guy. He just wasn’t the right guy.”
Everyone fell quiet for a moment.
Then Dylan snorted. “Anyway. No phones, no service, no exes.” He continued. 
“What about currents?” Jacob asked Dylan.
“Jenny was so understanding, she would do the same for her bestie so its all good bro” he said with a genuine smile. 
“Good,” Jacob said. “We’re officially off-grid after this next turn. No bars, no texts, just you morons and a cabin I rented on a whim.”
Dylan leaned forward. “Wait. Where are my AirPods? I swear they were in my pocket.”
“Use the app Einstein” Sam rolled his eyes. 
“No service wise guy” Dylan snarked back.
“They don’t need wifi, they locate over bluetooth” Jacob offers, its how I find my keys whenever I lose them and I lose them a lot.” Jacob says shrugging. 
“That AirTag, Eli gave it to you right?” Sam asks.
“back when he was still trying to organize my life.” Jacob says flicking it. 
Sam laughed. “Let me guess—he labeled it ‘Jacob’s Dumb Keys’ in the app?”
Jacob smirked. “Yup.”
“Why’d you keep it?”
Jacob shrugged. “Because it works. And I guess… I didn’t have the heart to take it off.”
Dylan raised his can. “To useful exes.”
They all clinked drinks and howled when Sam spilled his across his shirt.
For a moment, it felt like nothing bad had ever happened.


2-HomePod. 

The road ended in dirt. Then gravel. Then just packed forest floor.
The cabin came into view like it was being slowly developed from mist—two stories, logs dark with rainwater, windows dusty and blank.
“This looks haunted,” Dylan said, delighted.
“It’s perfect,” Sam added. “We can scream and no one will hear us.”
Jacob parked, pulled the keys from the ignition, and tossed them onto the cabin's front table once they got inside.
The cabin was beautiful in a quiet, unsettling way. It sat nestled in a clearing like it had always been there—wooden, moss-framed, with a wide porch and shutters that creaked gently in the breeze.
Inside, it smelled of cedar and old smoke. There was no Wi-Fi. No television. Just a dusty record player, a worn bookshelf, and a fireplace that hadn't seen flame in a decade.
They unpacked. Drank. Played cards. Music filled the rooms from Dylan’s Bluetooth speaker until someone asked about horror movies.
“Nope,” Jacob said. “I didn’t come out here to get spooked.”
“Oh come on, it's tradition,” Adam insisted, waving his phone. “I downloaded The Ritual before we lost signal.”
“Too on the nose,” Sam smirked.
“Come on,” Dylan said around mouthfuls of popcorn. “If you can survive Eli’s passive-aggressive brunch invites, you can survive The Ritual.”
Jacob rolled his eyes, but even he laughed.
The movie flickered on Adam’s phone. Jacob sat silently, staring at the glow of the screen as shadowy forests mirrored the one right outside.
By midnight, the fire was gone and so was the buzz.
Up in the loft, Jacob lay awake, watching moonlight stripe the ceiling. His iPhone blinked to life beside him.
1:47 a.m.No service.
His mind wandered—back to Eli. The way he’d screamed. The way Jacob had walked away.
He rolled over.
A soft creak outside made him freeze.
Just the cabin settling, he told himself.
Just old wood.


3-AirPlay. 

By morning, the spookiness had dissolved in hangovers and coffee. They hiked a trail behind the cabin. Took dumb pictures. Laughed too loud.
Jacob looked... lighter.
“You think you’ll talk to him again?” Sam asked as they walked together.
“No,” Jacob said. Then softer: “I blocked his number. Deleted the thread.”
“Clean break, I get it”
Back at the cabin, Jacob hung the car keys on the small hook by the cabin door and headed upstairs for a shower. 
Digging through his bag for fresh clothes he pulled on a shirt and some shorts and heading down stairs all set for another day of drinking and laughing and not thinking. 

That night the guys got a fire going out back in the stone pit, kicked back with drinks and jackets, and let the woods close around them.
Above them, the sky was a galaxy spill. Stars brighter than anything back in town.
“Okay,” Sam said, dragging a plastic tote out from the trunk. “What if I told you... I brought wiffle bats?”
Jacob turned from the fire. “Why would you even—”
Before he could finish, Sam tossed one to Adam and charged like a pirate.
“Have at thee, coward!”
The hollow plastic bats clacked wildly as they ran in circles through the clearing, laughing and whacking each other with exaggerated grunts. Sam got a hit to the ribs; Adam swung and accidentally took out a lawn chair.
“Christ,” Dylan muttered, watching from the deck. “It’s like having toddlers.”
“They’re having fun,” Jacob said, sipping from a can of something vaguely alcoholic.
Dylan glanced sideways at him.
“You okay?” he asked.
Jacob hesitated, then nodded slowly. “Yeah. I mean… yeah.”
“Not gonna lie, you’re handling this breakup way better than I expected.”
Jacob chuckled. “You thought I’d be crying into Eli’s old hoodie, huh?”
“I was picturing you listening to sad playlists in the dark.”
Jacob looked down at his drink. “Eli’s not a bad guy. He really isn’t. I just… couldn’t breathe around him anymore. He wanted me to be this version of myself I didn’t recognize. All routines and labels. He didn’t love me—he loved the idea of managing me.”
Dylan raised a brow. “That why you kept the AirTag?”
Jacob gave a sheepish smile. “Okay, yes, slightly ironic, but… it was useful. That thing’s saved my keys like four times.”
Dylan nodded, looking out at the trees. “You think he’s gonna be okay?”
Jacob shrugged. “I hope so.”
A loud thwack from the fire pit snapped their attention back—Sam had finally knocked Adam down. Both were on the ground, laughing uncontrollably.
“Victory!” Sam shouted, raising his bat like a sword. “Your kingdom is mine!”
Adam threw a handful of pine needles in his face.
They spent the rest of the evening roasting marshmallows, arguing over who could name the most horror movie tropes, and telling stories they’d all heard before but still laughed at anyway.
For one beautiful night, they were just four guys in the woods, disconnected from everything — from the past, from expectations, from the world.
No one noticed the quiet sound of leaves shifting in the woods.



4-Find My Friends. 

The night had turned cold, crisp in that way only deep forest can feel. The campfire crackled behind them, half a bag of marshmallows already gone.
“I gotta piss,” Adam said, stretching as he stood. “Be right back.”
“Take a buddy!” Dylan shouted after him.
“You wanna shake it for me?” Adam called back with a grin, walking into the dark trees with a lazy swagger.
Jacob glanced up. “Don’t go too far. This isn’t exactly Disneyland.”
“I’ll leave a trail of piss like breadcrumbs,” Adam joked.
They heard him rustle through brush. Then silence.
The fire popped.
Minutes passed.
Five.
Ten.
Sam checked his phone again—still no bars.
“Okay, he’s either lost, passed out drunk, or dead,” Dylan muttered.
Jacob stood up. “Let’s go find him before he pisses on a bear and gets mauled.”
Phone flashlights in hand, the three of them walked out past the edge of the firelight, beams slicing through the trees. The forest swallowed sound. Their boots crunched against dry pine needles and broken twigs.
Then Sam stopped. “There.”
Ahead, leaning against a wide, gnarled tree, was Adam.
From a distance, he looked casual—like he was resting. One shoulder propped against the trunk, head tilted slightly downward.
Jacob sighed with exaggerated relief.
“At this point, you’re just playing with it,” he called out.
The others laughed—amused.
“Alright, let’s go, King Stream,” Dylan said, walking forward.
They got within ten feet.
Then stopped.
Everything twisted in their guts at once.
Adam’s head lolled at an unnatural angle.His fly was still open.His throat was slit wide, blood black in the moonlight.He wasn’t leaning. He was propped.Eyes blank. Mouth slightly open. His last breath frozen in horror.
Sam backed away. “Oh my God—oh my God—”
Jacob couldn’t speak.
From behind the tree, a figure stepped out.
Tall. Masked. Covered in black.
He looked directly at them.
And gave a small nod.
The kind you give a stranger on the street.Polite. Almost casual. Jacob half expected to hear a “sup?” accompany it.Like he’d simply noticed them noticing him.
Then—they saw the light from their flashlights reflect off something metal.. a knife, big and very sharp. 
He vanished back behind the tree.
Jacob’s flashlight shook violently in his hand. “Go. Go!”
They ran—branches tearing at their arms, their legs—back toward the cabin.
But part of Jacob’s mind couldn’t stop replaying it:
That nod.
Like they were part of some inside joke they didn’t understand.
They didn’t stop until they slammed the cabin door shut behind them.


5-AirTag. 

They pushed the couch in front of the door. Barricaded the windows. Every breath was a panic.
“Adam… he killed Adam” Jacob said chocking on the words and fighting back tears. 
“Did you see his face?” Sam gasped.
“That was a mask,” Dylan said. “That wasn’t—he was holding something. I think—”
“A fuck off massive knife,” Jacob finished.
His hands were shaking.
He reached for his keys.
Stopped.
They weren’t there.
“I—my keys are gone.”
“Maybe you dropped them out there,” Sam said.
“No. I put them on the hook.”
Dylan’s eyes narrowed. “We need to get out of here”
Jacob’s blood went cold.
“My AirTag” Jacob spat out reaching in his pocket for his phone, I can find them just give me a second”
Sam blinked. “Where is it?”
“It’s…” Jacob trailed off
“Where is it?” Sam asked again. 
“It’s moving” Jacob said, his voice barely a whisper. 
“He has the keys” Dylan added looking out the window. 
Jacob and Sam join him scanning the wooded area for any signs of their attacker. 



6-Emergency SOS. 

“I’m going out there,” Jacob said.
“No,” Dylan snapped. “You saw what’s out there.”
“I can contact emergency services through satellite. I have to be under open sky. I’ll go. You two lock the door behind me. Don’t open it until I say my name.”
“No—” Sam said his voice shaking. 
“I’m not asking.” Jacob yelled. 
He grabbed a fireplace poker, opened the door, and stepped into the dusk.
The trees whispered overhead. Every shadow moved wrong.
He slowing and quietly walked away from the cabins tree covering and into the clearing they had been playing earlier. 
He held his iPhone to the sky.Searching for satellite…
Searching….
Satellite found, hold phone still. Connected…
Sending message…
Sending location…
Sending…
Sending…Message Sent…Help is on the way – ETA: 40 minutes
He turned to head back just as slowly and quietly as he had made his way to the clearing. 
Suddenly…
A whisper of leaves ahead of him.
Jacob looked.
The masked figure stood by the cabin holding the knife. 
And behind him, Adam’s body, propped like a puppet against the side.
Eyes open.
Throat cut.
The killer raised Jacob’s keys and jangled them.
Jacob ran around the cabin to the door. 




7-WatchOS. 

He pounded on the door.
“Let me in! It’s me Jacob!”
A pause.
Then: the click of the lock.
Dylan opened the door, face pale.
Jacob stumbled in. “He’s playing with us, he was taunting me with my keys and Adam’s body”
“Did you get a signal?” Dylan asked panicked. 
“Help is coming, but its 40 minutes away” Jacob said scanning the room. 
But something was wrong.
Sam was missing.
Dylan looked down the hall. “He was just here—”
A scream of pain came roaring down the hall.
Jacob and Dylan head to the kitchen.
Sprawled on the floor. Still breathing. But only just.
Sam lay holding his throat, eyes darting as his blood soaked the tiles.
Jacob dropped beside him grabbing a teacloth to press against his neck, the blood soaks through it almost instantly as Jacob looks up at Dylan then slowly away indicating that it was already too late. 
Dylan backed up.
“How.” he said. 
“He was right there as you knocked” Dylan said shaking
“He’s in the cabin” Jacob said standing slowly to scan the space.
“RUN” Jacob screamed at Dylan
A creak behind him.
He turned too late.

Jacob screamed as the killer appeared in the between them, silent, fast. He lunged at Dylan, Jacob Screamed again.” Run Dylan, outside NOW!”
The attacker made a bee line for Dylan, knife drawn, golden rays of light from the fireplace reflecting off the silver blade, before the knife could make contact Jacob stepped between them and took the blow to his side, it wasn’t deep but it stung like a mother. He pushed the attacker back dropping his phone and signalled Dylan to head for the door, the pair ran but the attacker was fast, he was back on his feet and heading for Dylan again, this time Jacob was too far away to stop him, he plunged the blade into Dylans chest and watched as he fell to the floor. 
Jacob screamed through tears as he backed up to the stairs and ran. 
Jacob staggered to the attic, clutching his side. Blood warm on his shirt. He collapsed behind an old wall panel.
His hands fumbled his Apple Watch.
He switched to his phone’s camera. It was facing the ceiling but Jacob could still make out the movements of the attacker as he dragged Dylan and Sam’s bodies onto the couch, he then headed outside and dragged in Adams lifeless body to join the friends in a trio of horror. 
The screen flickered as a boot stepped on it, the attacker looked down and picked it up,Stared directly into the camera and nodded… that same nonchalant nod. 
Then, the screen cut out.



8-FaceTime. 

Red and blue lights danced across the ceiling of the attic and faint sirens could be heard from about half mile down the path to the cabin, help was almost here but if the killer made his way to the attic it wouldn’t matter as Jacob might not survive the struggle. 
Jacob emerged from the shadows, breath coming in short gasps, blood soaking through his shirt from his wound, maybe it was deeper than he initially thought. His hand trembled as he slowing made his way down to the second floor, he quietly crept along and turned his eyes locked onto the figure at the top of the stairs.
The killer stepped forward. Masked. Silent. The keys to Jacob’s car dangled from his gloved hand, clinking softly. The sound echoed through the house like a countdown.
Then they moved—both at once.
The killer almost appeared to side step to allow Jacob to pass but not thinking clearly due to blood loss or adrenaline or a combination of both Jacob rushed the killer.
They crashed together at the landing, wrestling for the blade. It slashed through Jacob’s gut—hot, fast, deep. He cried out in pain and fell to his knees.
The masked figure staggered back.
And then—
“No!” He screamed. 
The voice was human. Familiar.
The mask came off.
Eli.
His face was pale with horror. Eyes wide. Breathing ragged.
“Jacob…” he whispered, reaching toward him. “No, no, no—God, I didn’t mean to—”
Jacob fell back against the wall, knife still in his stomach, trying to hold pressure against the wound.
Eli dropped to his knees.
“I didn’t want to hurt you,” Eli said, his voice breaking. “I just wanted to scare you. Enough that you’d see you needed me. That I was the only one who could protect you.”
Jacob’s mouth moved, but no sound came out.
“I followed you,” Eli said quietly. “I’ve been following you for weeks.”
He held up the keychain.
“The AirTag. You forgot to remove me from your find my list,  I saw where you were going before you even got there.”
His face twisted into something softer—something worse.
“I knew you’d be vulnerable after the breakup. You’d need comfort. I just… had to clear the noise. Your friends. The distractions. They didn’t understand you, Jacob. They laughed at you when you weren’t looking. You cried in front of them and they changed the subject.”
Jacob’s eyes welled with rage. 
“Its called friendship” Jacob spat blood with each word. 
His fingers found the handle of the knife and gripped it tight. 
“I was going to save you,” Eli whispered. “After everything, you’d come running into my arms, and I’d be the one who stayed.”
Jacob gritted his teeth.
“Jacob… don’t—”
He ripped the knife from his gut with a scream.
Lunged forward into a standing position and drove it into Eli’s chest.
They lock eyes. 
Eli gasped.



9-AirDrop. 

They tumbled together—arms locked, blood pouring—down the stairs, slamming into the railing, the steps, until they landed hard on the solid wooden floor mere feet apart. 
Eli reached out his hand to hold Jacobs but with his last ouch of energy Jacob pulled his arm away.
Before Eli’s eyes closed Jacob stared into the face that had once said “I love you” beneath fairy lights in his dorm.
Eli.
His hair was jet black, slicked back slightly, and he had the kind of square jaw and piercing blue eyes that used to make people do double takes in cafes. There was something almost classic about him. 
He looked strong. Clean-cut. Almost charming.
Until you looked in his eyes now.
Now it was just madness.
Jacob’s vision blurred and went dark. 


10-iCloud. 

Outside, the forest lit up with flashing blue and red.Sirens wailed.Help had arrived.
But it was too late.
Inside the cabin, only silence remained.

Why you might want to use MediaManager:

* OAuth/OIDC support for authentication
* movie AND tv show management
* multiple qualities of the same Show/Movie (i.e. you can have a 720p and a 4K version)
* you can on a per show/per movie basis select if you want the metadata from TMDB or TVDB
* Built-in media requests (kinda like Jellyserr)
* support for torrents containing multiple seasons of a tv show
* Support for multiple users

MediaManager also doesn't completely rely on a central service for metadata, you can self host the MetadataRelay or use the public instance that is hosted by me (the dev).

You might not want to use MediaManager if you are a power user of Sonarr or Radarr because it isn't designed for the Trash guides (there are NO quality profiles or similiar in MediaManager). This is because MediaManager takes a simpler approach at selecting the best torrent:

1. Sort by resolution (search for keywords in torrent names like FullHD, 1080p, 4K, 720p, etc.)
2. Sort by number of seeders

This way you get what you want in your preferred resolution that the most people downloaded (herd instinct). If you are just a simple man like me, then this approach is pretty good at getting the best media.

**As the title says, this project is still in beta and thus quite rough around the edges and unpolished. But I think it's ready for the first few beta testers (I've been using it myself instead of Sonarr and Radarr for the past two weeks).**

The idea of instant coffee concentrate that’s supposed to taste like a fresh brew sounded pretty appealing, especially for someone who doesn’t always have time to make a full pot in the morning. Ordered their original blend to test it out and used it mainly with cold milk or water for quick iced coffee.

The instructions are simple, just add 1 to 2 teaspoons to your liquid of choice, stir, and you’re done. The flavor was smoother than expected, not bitter or burnt like some instant coffee powders I’ve had. It tasted pretty close to a cold brew, especially when mixed with milk and a little sweetener. It also saves a lot of time, which was the biggest plus for me. I’ve even used it while traveling or on road trips when I don’t have access to a coffee machine.

That said, it’s not perfect. If you drink coffee mostly hot, it might not hit the same way, it’s definitely better iced. Also, the bottle is pretty small considering the price, and you can go through it quickly if you’re making multiple cups a day. The shelf life after opening is decent, but you still need to keep it refrigerated.

Overall, it’s convenient, tastes good (especially cold), and works well if you want quick coffee without the mess. But it might not fully replace your regular morning brew if you're someone who enjoys the whole coffee-making ritual.

1lq0zwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1lq0zwd/detailed_trip_report_623_630/,Detailed Trip Report 6/23 - 6/30,"We are currently making the drive back home to NJ, so I thought I’d write up a trip report. I’ll be as detailed as I can, and feel free to ask anything you want! 
Just to start, I (44) used to go all the time as a kid & my hubby (54) has really never been. We did 7 nights at Port Orleans Riverside with a 6 day park hopper, no rope drops, and virtually no stand by the whole trip. Pre-booked multi-pass & single-pass LL, Premiere Pass for MK, and three table service meals. I’m a planner by nature, so we ended up doing most of what we wanted at a relatively leisurely pace with very few hiccups!

Day 1 Monday, 6/23: Arrival, exploring Riverside, Disney Springs

After a two day drive, finally arrived at Port Orleans Riverside around 3pm. This being my first trip back to WDW in 27 years, I cried tears of joy as I walked to the lobby (and I’m not a crier!) We checked in online, but wanted to visit the desk for key cards and celebration buttons (20th anniversary & a 1st visit for hubby) The CM’s there were of course efficient and friendly. We drove to our room, Alligator Bayou building 25. This was a surprise as for some reason I assumed we’d be in Magnolia Bend. I then realized that I requested a corner room close to a bus stop, and that’s what we got! Right up the path from West Depot, the first stop in the loop which was excellent. After settling in the room, we walked through Alligator Bayou to the Riverside eateries & shop, then on to FQ for beignets. The property is so peaceful and beautiful. We were immediately pixie dusted by a wonderful CM named Kevin who chatted with us and brought us two extra desserts. He also brought us strawberry jelly and said it was his fav to pair with the beignets, and he was right. I gave him a CM compliment in the app right away. It ended up being my favorite interaction of the trip; he was just so kind, it really felt special. In the evening we took the river cruise to Disney Springs. We did the soda tasting from around the world and I am proud to say we are both team Beverly!!! Honestly I was expecting antifreeze or something, but we tried it first in the flight and found it delicious! We aren’t typically sweet beverage drinkers so maybe that made the difference. We walked around a bit and headed to Polite Pig, but the line was insane. At this point we were pretty wiped from traveling and the chaos of springs, so we just grabbed something at the Riverside quick serve, which was fine.

Overall take: love, love, love the resort’s vibe. It’s beautiful and peaceful. The beignets are worth the hype. The river cruise was nice especially coming back at night, but next time will probably skip springs as it just felt like a chaotic outdoor shopping mall to me.

Day 2 Tuesday, 6/24: Animal Kingdom & Epcot

We arrived at Animal Kingdom around 8:30. We had LL’s for Na’vi River, Flight of Passage, Safari, & Dinosaur. The Safari was first. We saw tons of animals, and our guide was lovely. Next was Dinosaur. I realized I rode it the first year it opened, and would be riding it just a few weeks before it closes. Definitely feeling the passing of time here. We caught a showing of festival of the lion King. Definitely worth it and a great way to beat the heat. We walked around Africa and Asia, where I chickened out of Everest lol. Just walking through the countries though was fantastic. When we got to Pandora, we did Navi River first. The shaman at the end was really something else, and I will add, we went back twice more during the week and it was unfortunately playing the B movie so I’m glad we got to see it the first time. Flight of passage blew us away. We ended up riding that twice more as well during the trip and would have kept going back if it financially made sense. That ended up being hubby‘s favorite ride in all of Disney. We did a 1 PM lunch at Sanaa and the bread service definitely lives up to the hype. We decided to split an entrée as we knew the bread would be filling and went with chicken and dal. The entrée was ok, but definitely Americanized. I will say that we live in an area in the NE with tons of great Indian food, so we are probably bias. We were pixie dusted again with a free dessert that I believe was mango lassi sorbet, also delicious. We went back to the room around 6 PM for a quick break then headed to Epcot around 7:30. I got very emotional as we made our way toward Spaceship Earth just around sunset, hearing the music and looking up at the ball. I was instantly hit with waves of nostalgia (again, not a crier!) We went to walk through world showcase a bit and watch the fireworks. Luminous is a fantastic show. We had a great view by Italy and American adventure. It ended up being my favorite nighttime show of the trip. 27,000 steps later, we were in bed and exhausted ready for a good nights sleep!

Overall take: We had a fantastic day at Animal Kingdom and ended up going back twice more during the trip. We loved this park and feel it is the most thematically cohesive park; you really feel the immersion here. We are animal & nature lovers, so enjoyed the trails. Definitely not a half day park for us like it is for some.

Day 3 Wednesday 6/25: Hollywood Studios

Today was a bit tough to get out of bed. I’m a teacher, so I’m on my feet all day, but hubby is not. Thank god for good shoes! We hit Runaway Railway first (hubby’s 2nd fav ride) and I was shocked to like it as well. I remember having fond memories of  Great Movie Ride as a kid, and thought this would be a let down, but it was fun. We did the Indiana stunt show, very entertaining and a good sit down break. Then off to Tower of Terror which was much more terrifying as a 44 yr old than when I was 17! Hubby said never again lol. We did a 1pm lunch at Prime Time that was fun as well as tasty. We had the wedge salad & meatloaf, which was very filling! Maybe not the best idea when you’re walking through the Florida heat, but it was worth it. Around 2pm we went back to the room for a mid-day break. After a quick shower/nap, we headed back to the park. We did Toy Story mania which was fun, then off to Galaxy’s Edge. Rise was awesome, and for Smugglers Run we got our own pod and were pilots (pixie dusted again perhaps?) Galaxy’s Edge as a whole just has incredible theming, and we spent quite awhile just taking in all the details. Throughout the day I kept trying to get a LL for Slinky Dog, but had no luck. Maybe next time. We got a carrot cake whoopie pie & some cappuccinos at trolley car, then headed for a showing of Fantasmic. (I know I’ll sound like a major coffee snob here, but we were thankful for the Starbucks in each park! Disney coffee in general was otherwise pretty abysmal lol. I promise that will be my only complaint for this entire trip, and I say it mostly in jest.)
Ok well, almost only complaint. We really weren’t that thrilled with Fantasmic. I could see how it appeals more to kids which of course is fine, it’s Disney after all. But for us the show was just meh, and the exit was actually panic inducing for me. Shoulder to shoulder, pushing to get out. I could feel people’s breath. No bueno.

Overall take: This park is HOT. I think this was the day I broke out in heat rash lol. There is just so little shade you are frying. Luckily hats really help & our spf held up. Despite having three rides we really loved, HS was probably at the bottom of the list for us. I can totally see and appreciate though how major Star Wars fans would put this at the top.

Day 4 Thursday, 6/26 Magic Kingdom

I will start by saying we bought Premier Pass for MK today. Yes it hurt purchasing it, but it was 100% worth it for this park. I did not want to be managing LL’s all day since there is so much to see and do, and I really wanted to take it all in. This was the day I was most excited for. I have so much nostalgia tied to Magic Kingdom, I knew I would get emotional seeing Main Street for the first time in almost three decades. And I did. Total waterworks as we went through the gates in the morning, the Dapper Dans singing from the trolley, the castle in the distance, all the feels. I could have stood there all day just taking it in. But off to Tomorrowland we went. First stop the People Mover, then made our way counter clockwise around the park. I won’t mention every ride (we did many) but will say I was glad to ride the Liberty Belle one last time, and sad to see the state of Tom Sawyer, though I get change is good. Stopped at Pecos Bill’s for some pretty good quick serve, and came out just in time to see the parade. This is a great spot as it’s in the shade, and we were able to walk into the Country Bear Jamboree right after to cool off. We took another much needed hotel break in the after noon, then came back to do my fav’s, Pirates & the Haunted Mansion. Unfortunately we didn’t get a good spot for fireworks (I forgot how chaotic the park gets at that time) and tried to wait out the crowds a bit before leaving…an idea everyone else had as well, so it didn’t seem to make much of a difference.

Overall take: I love MK. I will always say this is my favorite park purely for the feels. Hubby, not being a Disney kid and having no emotional ties, thought it was just ok. It was interesting to hear his perspective as a first timer.

Day 5 Friday, 6/27 Epcot

Today we made our way back to Epcot for a full day. Soarin, Living with the Land, Figment (my favorite character as a kid), the Nemo ride etc. then made our way through the park. We hit up Les Halles Boulangerie Patisserie for breakfast. The florentine quiche & croissant jambon fromage were delicious, as were the pastries we ended up getting in the evening (I am still dreaming of the raspberry lime curd macaron!)
Remy’s was next and so fun, we ended up riding it again later that night. Lunch was crepes from La Creperie de Paris, the savory ratatouille & a sweet with butter and sugar. Delicious. For dinner we made the mistake of doing a walk up at Chef de France. What a disappointment. Honestly I blame myself as I had thoroughly researched anything worth trying, and this was not on the list. Basically paid a small fortune for what I will describe as bad wedding food that sat under a heat lamp too long! Ah you live and you learn. The school bread from Norway and aforementioned pastries we had after made up for it though. We decided to forgo the fireworks to try and beat the bus crowds since we had seen them earlier in the week, but it was cool seeing them from different angles as we made our way to the front of the park. We even stopped and stood a bit by Walt’s statue in Dreamer’s Point, and I was once again hit with a wave of emotion.

Day 6 6/28 Hopper day & Hoop Dee Doo

Today we hopped around quite a bit, starting at animal kingdom, a break at the room, Hoop Dee Doo at 4 at the Fort Wilderness Campground, then Hollywood studios after that. I will say, if you do one table service meal, have it be this show. It seems pricey but honestly it’s a great deal. Basically all you can eat bbq including salad and dessert, and it’s a 2 hour experience. Is it the best meal you’ll have? No, but it’s decent (as I find most of the offerings in Disney) and the show is fantastic. It’s very interactive, and the performers are really amazing at what they do! It was a nice change from the parks and something we’d do again. Oh and bonus - Rob from Ear Scouts was sitting at the table next to ours! I may have fan-girled just a bit, but he & his party were very sweet :)

Day 7 6/29 Hopper day

Our last day in the parks. We love Animal Kingdom, so started there again, then hopped to Epcot and ended the night at MK. I will verify here that the lightening lane 1:59 hack really does work (for now anyway.) We had a return time of 6:15-7:15 at pirates, and didn’t tap in til close to 9. No issues at all. Hubby says it makes sense from a logistical stand point that they would have this buffer built in, even if it’s not something they advertise. It was tough leaving MK this night (cue the waterworks again) as the week of course felt too fast, and I worried it would be another 30 years before I would see it again. 

Overall trip take: A million dormant emotional memories came back to me this trip. I once again remembered the feeling only Disney World can bring. So much has changed, but so much has stayed the same, and I enjoyed all of it. So much so that I’ve decided I won’t wait another 30 years. I am going to take advantage of the bounce back offer, and book a short solo trip in November! Already counting the days til I can once again be in the bubble and enjoy the most magical place on earth :)

Things that helped tremendously:
- Blister cushions
- body glide
- lightweight umbrellas
- travel butt wipes
- travel hand sanitizer
- Advil
- rotating shoes
- Hats
- SPF 70. I’m very fair/burn easily, Sun Bum lasted hours without reapplying
- Moisture wicking clothes, specifically bottoms. Definitely felt the difference the days I wore these.
- LL multipass. We only did standby for walk on’s like people mover & spaceship earth. I don’t think I could go back to waiting in lines after this.
- Room location. Riverside is a large resort, but being close to the West Depot stop we were the first on in the morning and first off at night.
- Short mid-day resort breaks. This was a good rest & reset that kept our endurance up the whole trip. Crashing out is never good!
- Research! I spent about two months learning all I could as far as tips & tricks, how things work, where to eat etc. Big thanks to Ear Scouts, DFB Guide, Mammoth Club, and this subreddit!

Things we didn’t need:
- We were very lucky with weather this week, and didn’t use ponchos. Umbrellas we found on Amazon were super lightweight and much easier to carry around, so we just used those when it did eventually rain. Be sure to hold them out in front of you as you walk through security!
- We started day one with Camelbacks. Abandoned those day two. We have good tap water in the NE, and 95% of the time, the quick serve water was fine. We just made sure to ask for water throughout the day and we were able to stay hydrated with no problem without lugging water around. There is no shortage of free water here! We were able to switch to small waist packs this way, and that definitely took a load off our backs. If anything I may consider a lightweight water bottle in a sling next time, but it really didn’t feel necessary.

Thanks to all who read til the end. I hope this trip report helps or at least inspires your next trip! Please feel free to ask anything you’d like :)

1lq0x5k,https://i.redd.it/iyhcikreqhaf1.jpeg,Took me 3 hours but my Jura e8 has a new grinder,"Well after weighing my options, I decided to replace the grinder myself. 

It would grind, say “fill bean container” while full, then if I hit brew again it would brew. Annoying but worked, but I also have noticed a lot of grounds in my finished coffees lately. I called a local guy and he recommended a full refurb as I’m at over 8000 cups, and quoted around $500. I’m assuming a Jura refurb would cost around the same but I didn’t inquire. 

After much thought I decided to Amazon a new grinder for $30, and an oval head key that came with gaskets for $22. I didn’t use any of the seals it came with so in hindsight I probably could have gotten an oval key for cheaper but whatever. 

Followed a YouTube video on how to take apart the Jura and a second video on how to replace the grinder. Had it all back together in an hour, but I didn’t realize I didn’t tighten down the grinder screw enough so it wasn’t grinding…

Tore it back down and first loosened the grinder screw as I wasn’t sure what the problem was, put it back together and still wouldn’t grind properly. Tore it down again and tightened it all the way, and this time decided to test it before reassembly, and this is where my next problem came…

Grinder worked flawlessly, but I didn’t realize the water tank took off the gasket on the receiver when I took off the water tank… so I put it back together and the gasket was on my water tank and wouldn’t fit properly. After about an hour of troubleshooting the tank, I realized where the gasket needed to go. 

After everything, it should have only taken an hour, but I’m still happy with the result, and my savings of $450! I’ll have to take my savings over to FOH for a box of cigars.

I’m planning a 2-week trip to Colombia and trying to narrow down my itinerary — but I’m torn between two big experiences:

**Option 1:** A 2-3 day Amazon tour from Leticia  
**Option 2:** The 4-day Ciudad Perdida trek

I’d love to do both, but I’m not sure I have enough time. So I’m trying to choose just one.

Some context:

* I’m into nature, culture, adventure, and I don’t mind getting out of my comfort zone.
* My rough itinerary includes Bogotá, Salento (Valle de Cocora + coffee finca), Medellín, Guatapé, Tayrona park, and Cartagena at the end cause I'm taking my return flight from there

What would you pick between the two?  
Is the Amazon from Leticia truly unmissable? Or is the Ciudad Perdida trek a more unique and rewarding experience?

Would love to hear from people who’ve done either (or both)!

Thanks in advance 🌿

1lq0t9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1lq0t9g/went_back_to_ldr_after_living_for_6_months_with/,Went back to LDR after living for 6 months with DH's family,"I (24F) met my DH (25) online, we've been together for 2 years and married a year ago. We've had a perfect relationship up until his mom started to show her true self. Last December I moved countries to live with him and his family. Before that we'd meet in person on 4 vacations in another country that's between our countries. DH and IL's have never met my parents. Neither of us could speak each other's first language, I speak English with DH, IL's don't speak English. I started learning DH's language when we confessed and decided to live together in the future. DH said that when he told his parents about me, he said t**hey either accept me or he moves out** (this is important for later). 

On our **first vacation** (August) I met his parents for the first time. I didn't have any prejudice or bias against them at the time and genuinely looked forward to get to know them. Red flag I ignored back then: FMIL said I should smile more. 

**Second vacation** (November-December) was DH's gift for my bday, we lived together for 3 weeks. His parents tagged along in the middle of the trip. Red flags I missed that time: FMIL kept saying I don't realize how lucky I am that I'll get to live in a house with my DH and not in a shelter like other immigrants and refugees (I was weirded out and annoyed by how she kept saying it, and now I gett why, she already decided I was an ungrateful brat); suggested I bribe a visa center worker when applying. 

**Third vacation** (March-April) was when we had our wedding and I was done with her almost from the beginning. The first thing she did the morning we arrived was to invite me and DH to their room and give us wedding gifts. It was by no means urgent, we had night flights and we were going to do legal preparations in a few hours. As soon as we got back to our room I just cried out of sleep deprivation and stress in bed cuddling DH up until the person called to pick us up. We needed to take pictures for marriage certificate and I looked like shit with half my makeup gone. When we got done, IL's were taking a nap. Fast forward to the day before wedding, we went to try our wedding rings on. When I was taking mine off, it flew away and rolled across the table, the jeweler caught it. We're back in the hotel, IL's want to sit at the terrace so we go there. FMIL was poking at my hand, touching my engagement ring, I asked DH what she wanted, he said ""to take it off"", I said ""no"" (in a surprised/concerned manner) and pulled my hand away. FMIL got offended, had to talk with DH one on one, had him freak out that they would disown him. DH insisted I was in the wrong, I overreacted and should apologize. I told him this is insane to get offended and freak you out so bad over such a thing and that he should reconsider keeping contact with them. He said JNMIL also pointed out how I barely greeted them and if she didn't come close I would ignore her completely. I realized they just dislike me and looked for every excuse, DH tried to convince me they don't. In the end, I apologized, she didn't. Next day was the wedding, she wore black (I didn't pay attention but my mom later pointed it out), acted as usual. I think even before the wedding she said that I'm marrying not just DH but his family too. Another red flag. But I went along with the wedding because I didn't want to lose the love of my life. I regret not rocking the boat and setting my boundaries straight. Before we were going to leave, JNMIL yelled at DH that he should lay his clothes (jeans, windbreaker and a knit sweater) straight or it will get wrinkled and people will think they're asocial. And he just followed. 

After the wedding my relative found out about it and suggested my mom I apply for the passport of another country I qualify to be citizen of that'd allow me to enter DH's country too. DH had to register our marriage in his country first so he had the marriage certificate. I couldn't proceed with passport application without it. He suggested we could make a weekend trip around August to meet and hand the papers, since he didn't trust the mail. But then his family planned a whole vacation for everyone including me in that country in October, DH took the leftover days off for it. There was a long break between this and the next trip, and during that JNMIL texted me often. The day I was supposed to have a driving exam she texted me complaining that I won't come to them and I take too long to complete my legal matters and they hate this country where we go for vacation so bad and don't want to go there anymore. I got reasonably offended because she blamed me for taking too long to prepare my papers while I can't proceed because DH has the marriage certificate and we could've met already had they not planned the trip to this ""terrible"" country. My whole squad was laughing at her planning a trip for 8 people in a country she allegedly hates. I told DH I didn't like this behavior, he said she's just being supportive and compassionate and she's very sad that I'm not moving yet. That day it turned out DH isn't going to live with me apart from his parents and he was never gonna move away from them. I realized I have an SO problem and was miserable.

On the **fourth vacation** I didn't have fights with JNMIL, only with DH. At one point I told him how his mother's every action annoys the hell out of me and I can't imagine us living together. He said it'll all be fine. We were spending time together at 8 PM, JNMIL called halfway asking for instant coffee bags, and DH just went and brought it to her. He then regretted it and was afraid I'd hate him. And the last one was when I woke up early in the morning terribly hungry, was going to head to the canteen at the opening time, and DH said ""why can't you just wait for my parents to come for breakfast?""

In December I received my passport and was ready for the move. I told DH I didn't want for JNMIL to come pick me because I'll be overwhelmed after trip and don't want her to get offended and ruin my day. He said she did everything for me to be there, booked trips and it would be unfair to her. Whatever, I arrived and it was fine for a while. In February I started language classes, DH said I shouldn't worry about job before I finish them. IL's haven't worked since I've been there due to health reasons at only 56, but still think they're better at being jobless than me. They applied me to McDonalds and wrote a cover letter that got me ghosted. 

JNMIL went no filter and started to say much more unhinged things than before. Said she was friends with skinheads, **suggested I apply for political shelter** (aka embarrass myself at best because I'm neither a journalist nor a celebrity and pull a treason on my home country as an otherwise law-abiding young woman at worst), that **if I was the ""wrong"" nationality they wouldn't even look at me**, that my whole family wants to immigrate and they should all come. JNMIL was creepy about DH, said he'd pick her over me, he chose to live with them and that she knows him way better than I do. 

When I moved to their country, I could already understand spoken language *but not speak*, and IL's had a big problem with that (she speaks 0 foreign languages btw). First she told us to not speak foreign language in public or we'd be taken for terrorists, later we would be interrupted while talking. Like I'd be talking with DH in English, FIL comes and starts talking to DH. I ask DH what the hell was that? He said ""*oh yea, they will do it now*"", I said this is extremely disrespectful. Multiple times JNMIL had problems with my behavior, like when I went downstairs where there was only her, SIL and her older son, and JNMIL asked if I was going with them, I wanted to ask ""where"" and ""for what"" at the same time and said ""what?"" after staring at her with as confused face as possible to articulate that I don't understand what she was talking about, she said ""shopping"" and I said okay. Then I went upstairs, checked my phone, saw that she texted me asking if I wanted to go shopping with them before and then ""I'm not taking you with"". She legit got offended by how I asked ""what?"", didn't want any reasoning, never apologized and never acknowledged that this accident would make me not want to talk to them. DH wasn't present there and to this day acts like a flying monkey about it, that ""even toddler got terrified by how I said it"" (the 6 y/o toddler who's totally not influenced by his mom and grandma). Every conflict she'd go on a tirade of how they did everything for me, I'm very lucky to have it all, I could've had everything here but I must be missing my family and should go back home. Had problems with my voice and face and that I embarrass them in front of important people. Soon it also included that I hated them to begin with, never said a single word to them, crushed everything they gave me with my feet, that everyone told her I was a bad person, that there's no love between me and DH and we should divorce, and it's not bad if we do. Turned out ever since we've met she kept asking DH what was wrong with me and if I disliked them.

She also broke a zipper on my jacket and got offended that I got offended and said ""it's totally fucked up"" that I didn't like that she ruined an otherwise perfectly fine new jacket. She washed it without asking me for no reason, I only wore it twice that season. I've also repeatedly seen her unzipping shirts before doing laundry and assumed the obvious. No apologies, of course.

In April DH took 3 whole weeks off to work in the garden. I had to really beg him to spend time with me and my mental state started to decline. One faithful day JNMIL was talking to DH behind the door of our room when I was there laughing saying ""I've never in my life met such a lazy girl! Has she done anything today? Just divorce already!"". 

In the end of May DH forced me to go out of town together with IL's. I was already significantly depressed and shortly after realized I was. JNMIL had a problem with my face, then when she smoked again and I walked away from the smoke abruptly she lost her shit and went on an unhinged tirade for hours in the worst redneck accent calling me a snake, stupid cow, worst personality ever, no decency, no values, that my parents were unfair to me for a good reason, they know I'm a bad person and my mom must be a stupid cow too for having raised me like that, claimed I refused to work, and that this time I'm finally going back home and she'll ask lawyers to make sure I don't get anything. She still had the audacity to expect an apology from me. DH said we're gonna rent an apartment, then it turned into me having to start working and make enough for deposit. I convinced DH to do couple counselling, and after the first appointment I got over with the idea of going home and waiting for him to grow up. He tried to negotiate with them, they had an idea to move their bedroom into the garage. IL's were surprised I was leaving! They all including DH left me hanging for days before booking my tickets, had a stupid conversation where JNFIL asked whether I really want to go home and for how long, to which I said I don't want to, I just have no hope with this woman and it'll take a while for DH to be able to cut contact with them. To which JNMIL said the most appropriate thing to tell a stressed out person, that their whole family is on the federal police's watchlist and I will be arrested in the airport either there or at home and put into a prison. She also said she was *sorry that I drove her to the edge.*

They arranged a ""farewell breakfast"" for JNMIL's friend and GFIL during which mostly JNMIL talked. She said that in her opinion, I'm not coming back after I leave. I almost snapped once again. DH says she meant I wouldn't be able because of potential travel limitations and not that we're gonna break up as she clearly meant.

I wished JNMIL wouldn't come along to take me to the airport. It, of course, was ignored by DH again. She was yapping insults on the way, saying I was crazy and I ruined my life and it's all my fault, was blasting music, tried to force me to listen to her, probably asked DH to pull my earphone out when he did that and gave me a figurine of garden gnome showing a middle finger as a ""farewell gift"", said she had enough with the both of us. DH forced me to take the ""gift"" and didn't let me throw it away right there. 

I'm back home for almost a week and still not arrested. My family is disgusted by JNMIL's behavior and can't be fooled. And I know this happens to women that have degrees, work and speak the same language too, so it's not my fault. It is very weird to expect me to give my partner's parents as much attention as I give him and basically become friends with them. ",10,1751474749.0,JUSTNOMIL,7,0.92,False

3. Video 2 is as close as matic got to that stain. I would say it mops over part but not all of it. You’ll see no change, and also the mopping doesn’t really get near the toe kick.

**Option 2:** The 4-day Ciudad Perdida trek

I’d love to do both, but I’m not sure I have enough time. So I’m trying to choose just one.

Some context:

* I’m into nature, culture, adventure, and I don’t mind getting out of my comfort zone.
* My rough itinerary includes Bogotá, Salento (Valle de Cocora + coffee finca), Medellín, Guatapé, Tayrona park, and Cartagena at the end cause I'm taking my return flight from there

What would you pick between the two?  
Is the Amazon from Leticia truly unmissable? Or is the Ciudad Perdida trek a more unique and rewarding experience?

Would love to hear from people who’ve done either (or both)!  
  
Thanks in advance 🌿

I’m heading to Copenhagen with my parents (in their 70s) and toddler next week for 8 nights. I have both Nobis and Villa Copenhagen booked, and I’m having trouble making a decision. It’s a long time to be at any one hotel, and feeling the self-imposed pressure of ensuring my parents have a nice time. Hoping maybe comments from this group can help my indecision 😂. 



We don’t really have a lot of requirements beyond less than 1k a night, close to public transpo, no full carpeting in rooms and an on site restaurant in case we need to do dinner at the hotel one night. I planned this quite last minute so I didn’t have many options. Nimb is astronomically priced for the week we are there. 



With Villa, I’ve read lots of great reviews. But there are also a lot of negative reviews that say the lobby is unbearably loud with the DJ. One person recently described it more as a convention center than luxury hotel which irked me. Breakfast is in the basement, make your own your coffee from a machine, etc. There’s an on site bakery though which gives us another breakfast option if the buffet is depressing. My parents aren't keen on buffets anyway... It seems like there are 2 dining options for dinner. I don’t love being right next to the train station but we have a lot of day trips planned so might be grateful for the proximity on those days. Pool is a bonus (if we have time to utilize it).  



With Nobis, reviews are generally positive in recent years. I like that it’s nearly half the size. Our rooms are the smallest class though (smaller than what I have booked at Villa) and I read they’re really tiny. There’s a chance one room will be upgraded because of the card I booked with but I think the hotel is sold out. I’ve seen some noise complaints for lower level rooms. Restaurant seems a little better, though not always open. I think breakfast is a buffet in the main restaurant. Nobis is very close to Villa but Nobis is marginally closer to restaurant options / central area. Still within 10 min walk to central station. I generally don’t see as much written about Nobis so I don’t really have a sense of the hotel. 



I'd love to hear more about Nobis if anyone has been. Or if anyone has been to both of these hotels, let me know!

I order my creamers and SPLENDA on the SIDE, because I cannot trust them to do it correctly...  This morning, this lady argued with me to take the pre-made coffee, opening it up and showing me how she already added my condiments.  

(I order double, so I won't have to ask for more creamer and SPLENDA when I get my free refill)

I told her, ""No, this is not what I ordered. I do not trust you to make it correctly, please give me what is shown on my receipt.)

This illiterate imbecile came back with a handful of SUGAR and threw it in my bag.

I said, ""See? I can't have sugar.  THIS is why I don't trust you to do it for me.""

Together 11 years; 4yr dating, engaged 1yr and married for 6.  Pre marriage we both worked and had separate finances (oldest child is 12 and biologically just mine. Note, I was supporting her/I by myself before him and during our dating years.) He makes good money working transportation and I make retail money. I have always made lifestyle choices knowing my income(no vehicle before him so everything was walking distance type things). When we got engaged, he moved into my townhouse(he was renting a room in his mom’s house) and then 6 months later we got a house. 

When we moved into the house, I switched all my bills from the townhouse to our new house. Once married, bank accounts became “joined” and we both had access to each other’s accounts. I would go in on payday and take what I needed for bills, mortgage, groceries, kids, etc. I would often take majority of the money and leave him a small amount for coffee/food. During Covid, I did get online order happy but never spent more than we could afford based on the budget I made. Anything he asked for, he would get. Due to bad spending on both sides in our younger years we don’t use credit cards. In the last 6 years, I’ve worked F/T, maternity leave and then some stay-at-home time and back to working. He’s changed jobs a few times(including 2 rounds of unemployment). He was unemployed for 8 months in the last year and I was an asst. manager in retail. He had a job for a month in the middle but the hours/boss/pay weren’t great so he left. He got a new job a couple months ago and works 9-14 hour days Mon-Fr with vary starts. Its exhausting for him to do much more then sleep but the money is good. I recently quit to make things work

Money has been plentiful at times and also terrible. Through-out I’ve had the household expenses in my name/credit. Over the years (especially during tough times) I’ve tried to talk about money and his stance was as long as things were paid, and people were happy, it was fine. During these convos he told me in his last relationship that he was controlling with money and his ex went a year without a hair cut because he didn’t think about it. We also view things like holidays and celebrations differently. Mostly he’d rather not spend a dime or celebrate. So there was conversation about me continuing to be in charge of finances. 

Recently he’s expressed a lot of anger at how money has been spent over the years and the lack of savings. I’ve apologized for my part and said I can’t change it but we can figure out a better way forward. I don’t think my spending was crazy but we did waste money on things and food that we didn’t need. I did ask permission before purchases over $50 but am guilty of $7 Starbucks. I will say he had no savings at the beginning of our relationship but also no debt. But I do want to try things his way so I’ve tried conversations so I can understand how he would pay our bills and debts. These talks often end in one of us, if not both, feeling unheard and upset. I want us to talk. He doesn’t want to fight about money.

His current proposed solution is he’s wants to be 100% in charge of money and change all bills to his name. My credit is bad after the last year with unemployment but it feels like he’s doing it to avoid me not help the house. I’ve quit my job so he can work this job he likes. I’m not being reduced to childcare and a maid while he does what he wants with the money. He says I’m a control freak and I need to let go. So AITA for not wanting to give him complete control of the only money coming into the household because he doesn’t want to have hard conversations with me? ",1,1751474440.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

A few years ago my I moved abroad due to my job. I live in a big well known city (not saying where because of privacy) and as much as I love living here, I had a hard time making friends due to language barriers. About a year or so ago an old acquaintance I knew from college reached out to tell me she's moving here too and that we should hang out. Initially I was really excited but I've come to realize we don't have much in common and even worse, she gives me mad anxiety due to her life problems and constant negativity.

See, unlike myself she came on a visitor's visa. Somehow she got a job and upgraded her visa by working as a nanny for a family. She also found a boyfriend and immediately moved in with him. I told her repeatedly I thought this was a horrible horrible idea but she did what she thought was best for her. Surprise surprise, the guy turned out to be a horrible asshole and he treats her like absolute shit. Myself and some of her other friends have tried to help her out in various ways but she keeps going back to him. I've been with a guy like that before and my solution to it was to run back home to the safety of my family. She too has this option as he's not stopping her from going anywhere but she likes the lifestyle he provides for her so she puts up with it.

The issue here is she's constantly dumping her problems onto me. I feel like I'm her bloody therapist and when we hang out all we do is talk about her problems. It's really starting to wear on me but I haven't cut her off due to guilt. She's here ""alone"", hates her job, and doesn't have many other friends. She's really at a low point in her life but I also can't help but resent her for it because she's only gotten here due to a series of terrible choices that I repeatedly warned her about. I've stopped trying to help her and I've even asked her to stop dumping her problems in my lap constantly and she stopped for a bit but is now back to trauma dumping. I can't take it anymore, and whenever we hang out I walk away feeling drained, annoyed, and just overall awful. I saw her yesterday and I just wanted to get up and walk away mid coffee. At this point I'd rather be friendless and alone than be around someone so emotionally unaware and unstable.

I don't know how to ask her to stop contacting me because I just need space from her? She texts me daily about life updates I just don't care about at this point. I know it'll break her but we're not best friends and I don't know what else to do at this point. 

TL;DR: Friend from college moved to my city and desperately clings to me for friendship but ends up using me as her personal emotional dumpster and I'm tired of it but not sure how to break off friendship with her.",2,1751474313.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

We’re both pretty active and wanted something simple to start the day without the crash. What we ended up creating was a clean, intentional morning ritual that supports focus, energy, and long-term health — without relying on synthetic caffeine or sugary ingredients.

We know ultrarunners are dialed in when it comes to what they put in their bodies, so we’re curious:
Would something like this fit into your routine?

1lq0kfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1lq0kfa/i_can_draw_you_now/,I can draw you now,"I went to a cafe yesterday. I brought a book, my sketchbook, and a charcoal pencil. There were only 4 people (including me) in the cafe when I got there. I ordered coffee and a slice of chocolate cake. I remember you telling me that you don’t like sweets unless it’s chocolate. Who could say ‘no’ to chocolate, right? 



I was gonna stay there until I finished my food. The coffee I ordered was quite strong, and I eat kind of slow — I was going to stay there for a while. I knew I should get some reading done, but I brought out my sketchbook. I saw someone who looked a lot like you on the train. *I should try and draw him again*, I thought to myself. 



I was scared to draw you. Scared that I wouldn’t capture the features of your face. You’re not easy to draw. The previous attempts were kind of discouraging. They didn’t feel alive. They didn’t look like *you*. But I tried, anyway. I drew a guide–a circle and lines to mark where I’d place your eyes, your nose, and your lips.



I started with your eyes. The eyes that I stared into while you gently held the side of my neck with your hand and cupped my cheek with the other. Then, your nose. The nose that would slightly graze my skin while you planted kisses all over my imperfect body. And then your lips. Your lips that touched mine. The lips that called me beautiful.  The lips that told me I was yours, and you were mine.



I shaded, and shaded. My fingers were tainted with charcoal from my pencil. But I didn’t stop until it looked like you. I have your picture saved on my phone, but I haven’t looked at it. I had my eyes closed most of the time, reminiscing about the time I spent with you. I had this VHS-like scene playing in my head from my point of view. I drew you from my memory. 



Minutes passed. I put my pencil down and looked at what I had drawn. And it looked like you — it was *you.* I closed my sketchbook almost immediately. Ate the last pieces of my cake on my plate and drank the remaining coffee in my glass. I packed my stuff away and walked out of the cafe. I got on the same train where I saw someone who looked like you from that morning. 



When I was back in my room, I opened my sketchbook to the page where I had drawn you. I finally let out the tears I held back when I was in the cafe and on the train. The more my tears blurred my vision, the more my sketch looked like *you*. I held my sketchbook close to my chest. I couldn't care less about the charcoal leaving marks on my skin. It was the closest thing to feeling your skin on mine again. 



I slept with my sketchbook beside me last night. That page is probably the most worn-out page in my sketchbook from all the tears that fell on it. I know I should stop this. I wish I could erase you from my memory, but if I see that sketch again, I’m afraid I would fall for you all over again.



But hey, at least I can draw you now.

This event has a LOT of tantalizing rewards on offer. We've got MULTIPLE event-exclusives on the table!

First and foremost, the NEW Coffee Cup Earring, at the usual 100 tomestone price tag for the featured item.  
Next, a returning item in the form of the Demon Brick Earring, another event-exclusive item, which you can snag for 50 tomestones if you haven't before.  
Third and fourth, for the extremely reasonable price of one single tomestone each, there's the Hatchling Earring for glamour, and the Taoist Moogle minion!  
Finally, the Special Timeworn Maps are once again on offer. These maps guarantee treasure dungeon portals, so gil and treasure hunters alike would do well to stock up on these!

Exclusives aside, there are a lot of other excellent items in the Allegory goods. This is the part where I share my opinions on what other items I consider worthwhile (or not).

LOTS of mounts! If you aren't keen on farming Extremes, you can snag the Ruby Gwiber, Reveling Kamuy, AND Blissful Kamuy mounts from this event. If you aren't fond of Allied Society quests, you can dodge the usual rank requirements (or just the gil expense) to take home the Drake and Direwolf. A FATE reward mount—the Ironfrog Mover, typically from completing the Formidable FATE in Kholusia a few times—is available if you're missing it. There's also the Wind-up Kobold minion. You can't ride that one, but you can collect it nonetheless. She's very cute.

Card hunters, rejoice! On offer are 5 Triple Triad cards and one of them is EXTREMELY worth getting from this event if you're still missing it. Keep in mind, these cards DO have pre-requisites to show up on the Itinerant Moogle's list of goods, so review the Event Page if you need to. That said: Varis yae Galvus, of Memoria Miseria EX exclusive notoriety, is on offer for 7 measly tomestones! That's my top card rec. The 2B Card, from The Tower at Paradigm's Breach, is also a steal if you're still missing it—also just 7 tomestones. The Unknown Card from Anamnesis Anyder, another 7 tomestones, similarly worth it if you're still missing it. Lolorito Nanarito, and Gibrillont, normally won from Triple Triad NPCs, are 10 tomestones each; if you have nothing else to spend tomestones on and need those cards, go for it, but honestly? Those 2 are very easy to unlock and farm.

The Neo-Ishgardian sets are based on [the winner of a community gear design contest](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/fb9d4d8a0f121458309c5af43e9e3b7e7d5e21b5), and are Lv80 Masterwork crafts from Shadowbringers. This gear is gendered. In Endwalker, we got a set of crafted leveling gear that uses the same models in the form of Lv88 i545 Ophiotauroskin, Chondrite, and AR-Caean gear. Both sets only have one dye channel (presently) and while they dye slightly differently, they're otherwise identical—and the Lv88 stuff is INCREDIBLY EASY TO MAKE. Unless you've got your heart set on Neo-Ishgardian stuff, I'd pass on these.

The Moonfire sets are also gendered, but in the way that male and female characters get their own specific gear, instead of the same gear displaying differently. If you're looking to get the full glamour set, to make an Outfit, be warned there's also a hat and sandals/caligae you'll need to collect to do so. Also be aware, the Moonfire Tanga has a single dye channel, while the Halter, Vest, and Trunks all have two. (The Hat, Sandals, and Caligae all have two channels as well) These glams otherwise only come from Palace of the Dead loot, or are crafted from rare ARR treasure map materials—so if you do want them, this event is a good way to get your set started.

Any and all feedback would be great!,"[this is just the prologue for my book. I'm planning to make it into a romance, between a girl who feels lost and a boy she meets during a night of rebellion] 

The world seemed softer at night, the gentle LEDs casting a soft glow, a barrier against the unknown. The hum of my music vibrated through my headphones, a calm yet repetitive reminder that the room wasn't empty. I was still here. Still in the same place as always. Sometimes, it felt like luxury, the freedom of my unwritten stories sprawled across my desk, no job or responsibilities to hold back my pen. Pages written with care, though the ink smudged regardless as if a constant reminder that nothing would be perfect. Every story has its flaws, no matter how pretty the cover may be, this one isn't any different.

Sometimes, I lie awake, watching the seconds slip by. One second, two seconds, three seconds... wasted. At least, that's what I was told to think. ""Every second matters,"" they said, as I watched time tick away. I pushed myself from under the duvet, my brain refusing to retreat to rest as ideas flooded in. I reached across to my desk, lifting a page at random. It was short, written with care, the writing evident of the authors reflection on their own life. By that I only mean my own. My eyes scanned the letters, each radiating a feeling of understanding, as if the letters were going to form words at any moment - ""I understand you."" 

""I understand you."" Just words to the freed eye, comfort to those misunderstood. Writing can be interpreted, misread or even rewritten in new lights, just as easily as our emotions are on a daily basis, even when unspoken. I continued, the page denting under my fingers, even the pages felt as though they'd distance from me if I didn't hold tight enough. The fear of my own words drifting away as if they were nothing mere leaves in the wind, but even the smallest of leaves have to fall and make their mark.

Phone notifications blared, bird singing carelessly, the subtle hum from a news channel playing from somewhere below, the repetitive sounds pulling me from sleep. Not early, and not with complaint. I shifted, feeling the small gap in my curtains flutter with the draft as my bedroom door rattled. A yawn escaping my lips as I reached out for my nearby phone, turning off notification sounds - it wasn't anyone reaching out, just the reminder of apps where I could view people's perfect lives. The notifications that Stacey, from the college I attended not to long ago, posted a new story with her boyfriend. I didn't care, yet every morning I always found myself following the sounds, like some cursed figure bound to self-torture, and today? Of course, was no different. College photos. As if I needed to remember. My eyes lingered on the friendships on my screen, a few I knew, a few never seen before. I shut the phone off, the consequences of my own actions hitting my chest. 

Why did I drop out? Why did I not think? Why do I never think? 

No. I can't think like that. I left for myself, I wasn't happy there. I hated it. 

My hand traced the railing as I made my way down the stairs, abandoning the comfort of my room, leaving the curtains behind to shut out the world.

""Morning,"" my dad's voice echoed, pulling me from my thoughts as I flicked the kettle on without thinking. My mind, was already elsewhere, on college, naturally, and what my life might look like if I hadn't dropped out.

""Ignore me then, whatever."" The words sliced through my thoughts, pulling me back to the present. I instinctively turned toward the voice, letting out a quiet sigh.

""Sorry,"" I muttered, watching as he flipped through the channels. I knew exactly where he'd land: one of his gardening shows, the kind he always watched. He didn't even need to look at me.

""Did you think about that business idea I mentioned?"" His voice was casual, unbothered, his eyes glued to the screen.

""Dad..."" I sighed, bracing for another pointless disagreement. ""I don't want to start a business. I've said this a million times."" It wasn't that I was against the idea, it was rather the lack of motivation and idea of how to do so. 

""Of course you don't,"" he muttered under his breath, as if that response was all too predictable. The words landed harshly, like they always did.

""Look,"" I continued, trying to keep the frustration out of my voice, ""I just want a job. Not a business, not a whole venture. Just... anything, really. I'm willing to help you out at your work, Dad. Just something to do."" My words were genuine, fueled by a quiet need, but I tried to coat them with as much gentleness as I could muster.

My dad finally looked at me, his eyes tired but steady. He rubbed the back of his neck like he always did when he was trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, even though I knew what was coming.

""You don't get it, do you?"" he said slowly, his voice softening, but there was a firmness underneath it. ""You're too young for all that. You don't need a job right now. You're my responsibility, and I'm looking out for you."" He paused, the words hanging in the air like an unspoken rule. ""You don't need to worry about the world outside just yet. I'll take care of things here.""

He looked back at the TV, but I could see his grip tighten on the remote, like the words were still in his head, unwilling to leave.

""You've got plenty of time for all that when you're older. Focus on figuring yourself out, not getting wrapped up in a job you don't need right now. Trust me, I'm doing this for your own good.""

He didn't meet my eyes as he spoke, his gaze locked onto the screen, his voice quieter now, as if he was trying to convince himself more than me.

""Dad, I'm 17. I'm not a kid anymore,"" I said, my frustration bubbling up despite myself. ""I get that you're trying to protect me, but I'm not asking for the world. I just want a job. I want to do something... anything. To feel like I'm moving forward.""

I could already feel the heat creeping up my neck, the words spilling out faster than I could stop them. ""You can't just keep holding me back like this. I'm not gonna figure myself out if I'm stuck here, doing nothing. I need to live, to make my own decisions, not just sit around waiting for you to tell me what's best for me.""

His face hardened, the familiar tension creeping into his jaw. ""I'm your father. You don't get to decide what's best for you. I do.""

""Exactly,"" I shot back, sarcasm creeping into my voice, ""because you know what's best for me, right? You've got it all figured out for me."" I could feel my chest tighten as the words snapped out, sharper than I intended. ""I'm not a child, Dad! I don't need to be coddled, I just need-""

""Enough!"" His voice was loud now, cutting through the air like a whip. ""You're not ready for that kind of responsibility. You don't understand what it takes.""

I opened my mouth to argue back, but the words caught in my throat. The conversation had shifted too quickly, and my hands went cold as I realized there was no way out of this cycle.

I didn't speak again. The silence filled the space between us, thick and uncomfortable, but I didn't have it in me to continue. I never did, really. My dad always won.

My dad sighed, rubbing his temples like he always did when he felt the weight of another argument hanging in the air. ""Kiara, just make yourself something to eat, please."" Without waiting for a response, he turned back to the television, absorbed in his gardening show once again.

I didn't argue. It wasn't worth it. I grabbed some crackers, placed them on a plate, and moved in silence. My mind was still buzzing with the mess of our conversation, but I didn't have the energy to keep fighting.

I retreated upstairs, the weight of the conversation clinging to my shoulders like an invisible burden. 
Back in my room, the air felt different, colder, somehow. My curtains still hung the same, the gap fluttering gently with the draft. I shut the door quietly behind me, placing the plate on my desk without touching it again.

I sat on the edge of the bed.

Still.
Heavy.

My eyes wandered to the phone in my hand, the notifications still waiting, mocking me, maybe. I unlocked it. I don't even know why. Just muscle memory. A few Instagram stories had built up again. More parties, more friendships, more everything.

Then Stacey again, she was laughing in some sunlit kitchen with people I didn't recognise. Someone had her on their shoulders. Another day, another story.

I stared. Not with envy, not exactly. Just a quiet ache in my chest. A feeling like I had somehow missed something I was supposed to catch. Like life had kept running while I was frozen in place.

The urge came fast (too fast) to check job listings.
I opened the site.
Typed in ""part time.""
Then ""remote.""
Then backspaced it all.

What was the point? He'd never let me take one. He'd say it was a distraction, or too much responsibility, or not necessary. All the same lines I'd heard before.

My thumb hovered over the ""apply"" button on one listing anyway. Just to imagine it.
Then I locked my phone and dropped it onto the duvet beside me.

I let myself fall back against the pillow, my arms curled up, the room dim and quiet. I shut my eyes, but I wasn't tired, not physically. Just worn.
Maybe I always was.

For a moment, I remembered college. Not a moment of joy or success. Just a flicker, sitting alone in that cafeteria that smelled like coffee and tiredness. People laughing in a group I wasn't part of. Me, pretending I didn't care. I'd told myself I didn't want to fit in.

But I did.

I left not because I was weak, but because I was tired of trying to be someone I wasn't. It just didn't feel like that was enough anymore.

I turned over, pulling the duvet with me, burying myself under it like it could hide me from the truth.

And maybe, for now, it could. But Something had to change. I just didn't know what yet.",1,1751474100.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Plot twist: same state, same city, different continents","So about 9 years ago, I’m in Vietnam on vacation, sweating my life away, pretending to be “finding myself” when I was really just aggressively Googling “best pho near me.” I’m in some small shop grabbing a drink, and I end up having a tiny conversation with this girl. Nothing crazy, just small talk about how we both clearly don’t belong in the 110° humidity and how neither of us really knew what we were doing.

She was funny, chill, and cute in a very “cool traveler who actually packed sunscreen” way. We talked for a few minutes and then went our separate ways. Didn’t exchange contacts, didn’t even catch names. Just one of those “passing ships” moments.

But here’s where it gets weird.

Months later, I’m back in Boston, walking through the Public Garden, minding my own business, when I swear I see the same girl sitting on a bench reading. I do the world’s most awkward double take, and she looks up and does that “wait… do I know you?” squint.

We ended up talking again. Turns out she was the girl from Vietnam. And the kicker? We were both living in Massachusetts the whole time. Separate vacations. Random meet-cute on the other side of the world. Then we bump into each other at a park we both rarely go to.

It felt scripted. Like the universe went, “Okay, round two, don’t mess this up.”

This time we exchanged numbers. We got coffee. Then dinner. Then more of everything.

This is a lengthy post, so bear with me. It doesn't encompass everything about me, but is a close approximation.

Age: 28 female

Height: 5 2""

Caste: Kashmiri Butt

Sunni, practicing Muslims

Single, never married or engaged

City: Lahore

**I'm looking for someone who's originally from Lahore in order to make the family meetups smoother and finding cultural similarity as well. Same city helps to connect better.**

**Education**: BS (Honors) in Applied Psychology and Master's in Clinical Psychology.

\-> Currently preparing to apply for a PhD

 

**Profession**: Clinical Psychologist/ Mental Health Counsellor

Family: We're 3 siblings, including me. One brother, one sister. Mother is a housewife. Father is retired.

Do you want kids? - Yes, of course. But I’d like to wait at least a year and half or so to settle into the marriage first, get bonded and acquainted with each other's patterns better before stepping into the role of a parent, which is an enormous responsibility as is.

**Religiosity**

I’d say that I'm a relatively practicing Muslim. Although I’m clearly not perfect, I do pray at least 4 times, do obligatory fasts, always dress modestly, like to learn from various scholars like Mufti Menk, Dr. Omar Sulieman, Nouman Ali Khan, etc. to become a better Muslim and a better human being.

Mind you, I’m modest but not an extremist/conservative by any means and highly value open-mindedness in myself and others.

We don’t celebrate Milaad, khatam or do any other nazro niaz. I'd like someone who’s on the same page.

**Deal Breakers**:

* Being younger than me
* Drinking, smoking or any kind of substance use
* Good old commitment issues! :( (If you're not ready to marry and settle down, please move along)·
* Me having to live with in-laws after marriage
* Poor emotion regulation (anger management issues) and poor communication (think: stonewalling)
* Not concerned with whether you earn halal or haram/ via fair or unfair means.
* Arrogance, lying, closed-mindedness

**Ideal marriage timeline** – Around 1 ish year, but this will obviously be mutually decided.

**Important Characteristics in a Prospect**

**Education**: Anywhere from BS Honors to PhD, MBBS, etc.; the higher the better. Intellectual compatibility is absolutely paramount for me, such that we teach and learn from each other. I am a sapiophile.

**Age**: Somebody older than me

**Self-sufficient** – I fully acknowledge that women are nurturers and carers; they make a house a home. Having said that, I’d highly value a spouse who is not shy to help around in the house chores and is able to manage himself when the need be. Showing consideration for your spouse is a beautiful trait (for any adult, not just men).

**Balance of Deen and Duniya** – I know, it's cliché, right? Let me explain.

This means praying regularly, being God-fearing in his conduct and aspiring to become a better human being. Bottom line, the basic pillars of religion should be there. I’m not looking for perfection, (I’m far from it myself tbh), but having high moral values guiding you and having a strong moral compass is golden. Mind you, I don't endorse the typical regressive ideology, so nothing extreme.

I’d also like my partner to have good Ikhlaaq; so he’s kind, easy to talk to and has good relationships with people around him. Humility is the greatest virtue; I believe that religion is best reflected in one’s good character, not the obligatory prayers or fasts.

**Having Perspective and being far-sighted** \- Someone who values character, commitment, meaningful connection, loyalty and personality compatibility beyond just typical appearance ideals. Indeed, physical attraction is important for marriage, but is still only one part of the equation; true connection goes so much deeper. After all, what are you left with once the novelty runs out? The ""person"" you married :)

**Emotional Safety** –  I wish to feel emotionally safe with my spouse. Someone who respects my opinions and others' too, is open-minded, trustworthy, gives space and grace, respects my boundaries, is supportive, patient and respectfully tolerates a difference of opinion. A dynamic where we both feel heard and seen and can express ourselves without fear of judgement or keeping score; where we both can be our authentic selves :) Emotional intelligence is very attractive!

**Good communication** – There are few things I value more than good communication skills. I would love to have someone who is able to articulate and openly express his thoughts, opinions and feelings and be willing to have difficult conversations with me with trust. I'm saying this, because I embody these myself.

**Freedom** – Freedom is my strongest core value. I want to feel free and autonomous around my spouse and not feel caged. I’d really appreciate having a choice to work or to stay home. Someone who can respect the concept of giving space.

**Nuclear family** \- I'm a proponent of a nuclear family, i.e. husband, wife and their kids, which is conducive to (well-deserved) privacy and mental health of all parties involved. I was raised in one, so I can attest to its importance and merits. Unfortunately, joint family system fosters many domestic disputes, inevitable conflicts and resentments (no matter how nice people are). So, I’d really appreciate if you can understand this (without being offended) and can provide a nuclear family setup.

**Financial stability** \- Not being materialistic or unrealistic here, but someone who can sustain their family in the long run.

A simple wedding - I'd prefer a relatively simple wedding.

**NOTE**: I know nobody is perfect, and this is a broad sketch of an ideal person for me; anyone who’s somewhere along these lines would be wonderful. Afterall, humans are quite heterogeneous :)



**Hobbies** \- Wese to I’m pretty boring by regular standards, but here we go ;)

I love to watch English movies, series, anime (AOT anyone? Studio Ghibli? IYKYK), love listening to audiobooks (or reading them when required by my profession). But I do read a lot of things other than books (e.g. research papers). These days, I’m listening to “The Happiness Trap"" by Dr. Russ Harris. If you want your mind blown and your horizons broadened, I highly recommend it :)

I watch documentaries and video essays on social, cultural issues, psychology, psychiatry, healthy lifestyle, true crime, etc. I’m into learning about nutrition and physical health and try to incorporate the learnings in my life as much as is practical for me. I’m mesmerized by space; its unfathomable vastness and the mystery of the universe fascinate me. I'm an avid listener of podcasts on a plethora of topics from religion to medicine, mental health, relationship psychology, self-help and neuroscience, etc. I think YouTube is the greatest learning and leisure resource. My favourite ones are Modern Wisdom by Chris Williamson, Diary of A CEO by Steven Bartlett, The Huberman Lab and Mel Robbin’s Podcast, among many others.

 

**Interesting things about me:** Phew! Here we go!

I’m an ambivert and keep a very small circle. I love my “me time"" and socialize selectively. I’m detail-oriented and prefer routine and order in life. I’m a Type-A person and an ISTJ (if that matters to you and you understand it). I'm generally a simple and low-maintenance person. I’m a bronze medalist and also a published researcher in the discipline of Clinical Psychology. I'm very particular about my privacy, in real life, and especially online.

With the select few ppl, I'm a huge conversationalist. My idea of a good time is having deep conversations and sharing ideas over a cup of chai/coffee. I'm a very curious person and love to ask lots of questions. I love to teach and explore concepts with others. Things like watching and discussing movie plots, fan theories, documentaries, existential questions, ideologies, psychology, philosophy, space/universe, academia and books you read are all right up my alley. I’d love to explain and discuss all about biopsychology, evolutionary psychology, neuroscience and psychiatry with my spouse. Yeah, I’m a nerd, lol 😉 The gist is: I’m a fan of cognitive labor.

If you get me started on topics of my interest, I'll go into rabbit holes with so many tangents, you'll probably have to stop me at some point. Hehe :) Some say I'm a decent listener too sooo... (hey, I’m a therapist afterall...)

I grew up in the Middle East. I highly value taking care of my physical and mental health. I’m family-oriented (my graduate research was on parenting). Still, I believe one can never prepare enough for a job as daunting as ""good parenting.""

I'm working on becoming a better cook. So if you also cook, it'd be a plus and a great bonding activity in addition to movies, walks, long drives, and whatnot!

\\ (•◡•) /

I’m an optimistic, reflective, and a fun-loving person in general. I try to find meaning in every experience I have. The smallest things give me joy. I also tend to be firm in my boundaries with people.

I absolutely LOVE animals and have a few pets myself (cats and birds). They keep my heart so so full. Still wish I could have many more :(

I cherish quality family time and hangouts. I'm definitely not brand-conscious and I don’t watch the brain-numbing news (I do stay updated on world events, though). Personally, I live and let live and expect the same from my spouse.

I’m inclined towards rationality, facts, pragmatism and logic; I'm not an idealist. I also believe that critical thinking is a human's greatest asset. I’m less of an outdoorsy person and enjoy indoor activities much more. But I'd surely love to travel and explore new experiences with my spouse :)

Personally, I stand somewhat in the middle of the right-left wing spectrum (as both sides have some valid arguments), and I concur with the original ideology of feminism and female empowerment that Islam very aptly and rationally embodies.

 

**Bottom Line**

I’m looking for a caring, intellectual, respectful, and emotionally available man. Someone I can look up to with utter respect and admiration.

I wish to find someone who's my safe space and I'm his. Someone with whom I can make all the dumb jokes and laugh at the silliest memes together - a best friend for life ;) Hopefully, someone who loves and adores animals as much as I do. And obviously, I’ll also reciprocate everything that I mentioned above without question.

P.S. Nobody is perfect, and I'm sure as hell not! But if you think we may be compatible, let's talk and explore. Take a chance!

**Note**: Please mention your profile if you reach out. And please stay away if you’re not seriously looking for marriage.

With a profound decision like marriage, let's vet each other first. Once it’s initially apparent that we’re a good match, parents will definitely be involved for sure.

**Bht bht shukria for having the patience to read through this long ass post and for your time** 🤝🏻

May Allah make it easy for all of us, and give us the partners who bring out the best in us! Ameen.

[What to watch at the Calgary Stampede](https://www.reddit.com/r/eiiuwqwqs/comments/1lp2cwh/how_to_watch_calgary_stampede_2025_for_free/) Rodeo and chuckwagon races

Every afternoon at 1:30, the world’s best rodeo athletes compete for a total of $2.17 million in prize money. Chuckwagon races take place nightly at 7:30 p.m.

Rodeo tickets include free admission into Stampede Park for that day. Assigned seating tickets can be purchased online and standing room only tickets will be available at the gate day-of starting at 11 a.m.

Barrel racing

In a race against the clock, contestants circle three barrels and race back to the score line. Riders are permitted to touch barrels, but a five-second penalty is added to their time if one is knocked over.

Bull riding

Riders attempt to remain mounted on a bull while the animal bucks violently. While not required to move their feet, riders can get higher marks if they spur.

Tie-down roping

A cowboy riding horseback chases a calf with a 10-foot head start, attempting to rope the calf and dismount on the run to reach it and tie three of its legs.

Steer wresting

A steer wrestler on horseback chases a steer with a 12-foot head start, eventually dropping from his horse and grabbing the steer by its horns. A steer must be on its feet before being rolled to the ground, and once on its side the official time is taken.

Saddle bronc

A rider will move his feet from the horse neck toward the back of the saddle as the bronc bucks. hand placement is key in this eight-second event.

Bareback riding

Needing to hold on for at least eight-seconds, bareback riders extend their feet far forward on their horse and pull their feet up toward the rigging around the horses girth in a spurring motion. The higher the spurs, the higher the score.

Breakaway roping

Requiring speed and precision, breakaway roping is one of the fastest events in rode. The rider, following a calf with a head start, is required to rope the calf and stop their horse as quickly as possible. This will cause the rope to “breakaway” from the saddle horn it is tied to, and time stops. Ladies’ breakaway roping is new to the Calgary Stampede rodeo this year.

Chuckwagon races

Watch nine nightly heats as 27 chuckwagon drivers and 162 horses race for prize money.

1lq0eeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1lq0eeb/when_leadership_fails_those_who_give_their_all/,When Leadership Fails Those Who Give Their All,"I started working at a small nonprofit organization in 2018 as an intern. Over the years, I worked my way up from customer service to full time coordinator and eventually to director of operations. I trained new staff, managed daily operations, filled in wherever needed, and kept things running through chaos, leadership changes, and high turnover.

Then everything changed when a new leader came in.

At first, they seemed full of energy and fresh ideas. But it did not take long to realize empathy was not part of their leadership style. In one conversation, they mentioned they would not be able to supervise 14 people. I remember thinking well, I am. I was still handling my own work plus helping them with tech tasks and other things. But none of that was really acknowledged.

I asked for real guidance and support. I told them about the heavy load managing so many new employees while keeping things afloat. Their solution? They suggested I have coffee with people they knew. No real mentoring or support. Meanwhile, I was juggling everything.

One day, I got injured on the job. Instead of concern, the leader got visibly upset. They left to make phone calls, then pulled me and two coworkers aside to say they were disappointed we had not told them immediately. We were still processing what happened and had already filed an incident report. It felt like it was more about their being left out than about our safety.

There was obvious favoritism toward certain departments, and when a misunderstanding ended up on my performance review, I brought it up. Their response was a simple okay no correction ever came. I was also told to work with the HR representative since it was my first time conducting staff performance reviews. I followed that advice only to have it later used against me in my evaluation. It felt like a trap.

When I told the leader I was planning to leave, they offered me a new part time position supervising just the 14 people with lower pay. It felt like a move to avoid looking bad rather than a genuine opportunity. I was like, excuse me? It was clear they wanted me out quietly by cutting my hours and income without firing me.

The board acted like a tight high school clique. No accountability. Blind support for leadership. No safe space to speak up or be heard.  
  
Boss & BOD's excuse for people quitting was always the same: “Things are changing, and some just can’t keep up.”

In my final months, I started feeling physically sick every morning before work. My stomach churned and every interaction with the leader brought on anxiety. I kept thinking, will I be fired? For what? I was not doing anything wrong. The fear was constant I was in survival mode.

Eventually, I quietly resigned after more than five years of dedication. I was not the only one; several longtime employees left under the same leadership. Once you stopped being convenient or fitting their image, you were discarded.

I just needed to get this off my chest. Maybe someone out there needs to hear it you are not weak for wanting empathy. You are not wrong for walking away. And you are never disposable no matter what they made you feel.

I have money, I travel, I know tech and coding really well ( everyone relies on me when it comes to this job ) – I even build side projects and I’m good at organizing things. I’m not blocked by money or opportunity at all. Everyone in my city knows I come from wealth. Some think I’m arrogant or that I already “have everything,” but the truth is the opposite.

I feel dead inside.
While other teens laugh, mess around, flirt, and enjoy life, I just sit in cafés with the same two friends – who are just as bored and stuck as I am – drinking coffee and doing nothing. I don’t approach girls. I don’t do anything spontaneous. I don’t enjoy the chaos or freedom that teenage years are supposed to be about.

Physically, I’m average weight but not strong – I have no muscle. I’m considered good-looking, and deep down I know I am – but I have zero confidence. People assume I have girls, a wild life, whatever… but no. I’m social on the outside, but I freeze up when it matters. I travel with friends and cousins, I get chances to meet people, but I never take the leap. I overthink everything. I miss moments.

I see others just doing stuff – joking around, making memories, being loud and stupid and free. I just… stand still. It hurts.

I know what I’m capable of, but I feel trapped in my head. I want to get out of my shell and truly live my teenage years before they’re gone.

Am I crazy? they are usually 2-3x more expensive too.. And lacking is richness and bitterness, even the cheapest classic (dark) roasted coffee is twice as good as the next gold.

For context, Gold-roasts (usually look like light brown granules) are FREEZE-DRIED\*

Whereas; Classic (or dark/rich) roasts \[usually look like dark brown/black powdery granules/dirt\] are SPRAY-DRIED\*

Which is a cheaper process but apparently inferior when it comes to taste.. I strongly disagree. The only benefit of gold roast IMO is there's less acidity and it's easier on the stomach for people like me with IBS for example.

I am done with it now.. I thought maybe I hadn't tried the right one, but I imported some crazy expensive, organic, water process, you name it, gold instant and it was comically bland. (needed 4 heaped teaspoons to get a decent cup)

I should say though, generally if it wasn't for the stomach issues I wouldn't go near instant coffee\* I usually would grind freshly roasted beans myself and brew.",1,1751473197.0,InstantCoffee,0,1.0,False

I was just wondering, if anyone has ever tried the “not” technique for manifesting an SP and how they did it and results? By the “not” technique I’m referring to his ladder experiment essentially, but with an SP

Also looking for advice on how to try testing it? I kind of want to give it a try out of curiosity, but I’m not sure how to even go about it since an SP is really something you’d generally have an attachment to, unlike a ladder or a cup or coffee. For example would it be like visualizing being with SP at night when I go to sleep, and then telling myself “SP is not single” if there is a 3P? Or something different? Finding the right wording seems like it might be tricky in this case so I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with this particular situation or if it’s just not really worth even trying and experimenting because of the attachment or potential of backfiring or something else ",2,1751473133.0,NevilleGoddard2,3,1.0,False

Luckily, just across the street from the Portland Transit Station, sits Tony's Donuts. A fantastic little bakery with some of the best donuts around (even better than Holy Donut). I met Tony as he served me a coffee and a small assortment of pastries. Incredibly friendly, we chatted for a bit before I left to catch my train.

The coffee was your classic bakery cup, which will always hold a place in my heart as A-tier. The donuts were dense, but squishy and moist. The glaze was light and added a very nice texture.

This donut shop has a long history, hard earned through the dough-cades. Definitely worth a stop while in town, followed by a trip to the Cryptozoology Museum just down the road.

8.9/10 - No lemon donuts left when I went there.",1,1751473120.0,Soapbox_News,0,1.0,False
