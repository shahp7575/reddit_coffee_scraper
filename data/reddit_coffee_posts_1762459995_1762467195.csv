1oqbugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1oqbugs/sleep_advice_please_im_begging/,Sleep advice please I’m begging,"So I have had this problem for years, you know ever since I was in sixth grade or even younger is that I wake up till midnight and sleep in the afternoon or evening …at one point, it even got that bad that I used to wake up at 5 PM in the evening And sleep at late mornings. Now, I got better. My sleeping schedule started turning out fine, but then I fell sick and it was fucked up all over again, now I am writing this at 3 AM almost. Because I am so tired of living like this, I wish I was a morning person because not being able to wake up early is literally ruining my life and I’m not joking. It’s ruining my routine, my school life and thus you know my relationship with others. So, in my early teens, I used to sleep like 11 hours (atleast)or more, and I feel that old habit is returning and I cannot afford it. I have gotten into a point where sometimes I lie for like at least 2 hours and most of the time fail trying to fall asleep at night. I just wish I was normal because again this it is really affecting my day-to-day life and I want to change before it’s too late.

my main problem is, I do not know what to do at midnight because I am stuck, thinking that I am too tired to study or work, but I am too awake to actually fall asleep, and then hours pass by and I just regret since I would have done my work in those passed hours, and this cycle goes on and on again, and it’s so annoying because if I was a morning person, I would have no issue and I have seen it last week. I woke up early and got decent amount of work done or at least got started and the day felt longer, and I’ve been trying to wake up early ever since, but I made my situation worse. 

Also, I cannot fall asleep without thinking about sexual stuff because it’s the only thing that truly distracts me (since I am constantly bombarded with intrusive thoughts) but I am really sick of thinking about things like that and being so dependent on it.

I tried cutting off my screen time, hiding my phone, setting morning puzzle alarms on three different devices, coffee, cold showers but I always seem to get sleepy at daytime/evening not at night

1oqbskn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1oqbskn/expected_to_work_in_soaking_wet_clothes_in/,Expected to work in soaking wet clothes in November,"Hi guys! I wanted to share something that just happened at my new job, perhaps to rant about it, perhaps looking for some kind words, because I still feel shaken about what happened.

After applying at lots of jobs, I (24M) got a job as a door-to-door fundraiser. This essentially means knocking on people's doors to try to convince them to sign up to monthly charity donations. Shitty job that paid exactly UK's minimum wage. A lot of what we were told at the beginning turned out to be false. We were literally told during training not to worry about numbers, that they are just looking for effort. During our second week they revealed they actually have a very rigid quota and they will fire you if you can't make it happen, even though whether or not people choose to donate is something outside your control. We were also told we will have discounts for takeaway food, free coffee and free cinema tickets. Turns out the perks only applied to the most stellar of employees.

Next, they had very predatory tactics to get people to donate. They told us we must ""be like sharks"" and push when people said no. However, I wasn't comfortable pressuring people, so I used a gentler approach. I didn't push past people's ""no"" and accepted rejection. I didn't get many sign ups - in fact, I only got 2 sign ups in the 2 weeks I lasted in the job. Our quota was 16 in 4 weeks.

The workplace was toxic. A few days ago, my other male colleagues engaged in disgusting and misogynistic locker room talk while on the job. Our team leader initiated this talk and he started bragging about having slept with ""women from 20 countries"", ""collecting women of all nationalities"" and ""having threesomes with bi women"". He also started loudly describing his girlfriend giving him blowjobs. I was very grossed out. I tried to ignore them. For context, I'm a queer guy. 

Our team leader also has a very fragile ego and he started yelling at a coworker because the coworker suggested our team leader communicate meet-up times earlier, because some people have to commute. The colleague said: ""I think you should confirm meet up times the day before, not the day of the shifts."" The team leader started yelling: ""I am the boss and I don't have to give you explanations for my choices! I'll let you know about your shift when I want to! You better respect me!"" He was on a power trip.

I already wanted to quit, because the workplace culture was toxic, our team leader was a piece of shit, etc., and I hadn't even been there for 2 weeks. Oh, another fun fact about this job: they also expected us to do unpaid overtime, but I would quietly sneak away during overtime, and no one would notice I was gone.

Fast forward to yesterday (finally the topic of my title): we start our shift in pouring rain. We're walking around outside, knocking on people's door, all while we're getting rained on. Here's the bad part: we had to wear a charity T-shirt with the charity's logo (a thin, short-sleeved T-shirt) + a badge that said our name and also featured the charity name, logo, and other details. Because our T-shirts needed to be on display, our supervisor didn't allow us to zip up our jackets and actually cover ourselves form the rain. He was looking at us to make sure we weren't zipping up our jackets. Also, the supervisor himself had a charity waterproof jacket that signalled he was a supervisor, so he was fully dry, while we were getting soaked in the November rain, because of the rule that we had to have our T-shirts on display.

The rain started pouring harder and harder, like a shower curtain. I ended up soaked to the skin, charity T-shirt so drenched it was sticking to my skin: it was just as wet as when you take it out of the washing machine. I'm getting really cold (obviously). Cold rain water is running down my back. It's been about two hours. Finally, I can't stand it anymore. I take off the fully soaked charity T-ahirt, wring it out, put it in my backpack. Then I put on my rain jacket directly on my bare skin (since I didn't have anything else dry), zip up the jacket, then pin my badge that showed the charity name and logo on my jacket. I continue knocking on doors. My supervisor appears and asks: ""Where is your charity T-shirt?""
Me: ""It was fully soaked, so I had to take it off, but I'm still wearing my charity badge.""
Him: ""Put your shirt back on.""
Me: ""I can't. It's fully drenched.""
Him: ""Do it.""
Me: ""No.""
Him: looks absolutely shocked. ""What do you mean, no?""
Me: ""I'm not putting it on. I'm cold.""
He looks absolutely perplexed. I continue knocking on doors and I think he dropped the subject. A few minutes later, he pulls me aside again.
Him: ""I had a phone call with the bigger boss and he said you have to wear the T-shirt.""
Me: ""I can't.""
Him: ""Yes, you can, you just don't want to. You CAN put on that T-shirt.""
Me: ""I don't want to get pneumonia.""
Him, rolling his eyes: ""It's not cold enough for that.""
There's more back and forth, him insisting, me saying no, repeating that the T-shirt is fully soaked. He says ""I don't care."" Now I'm starting to get angry. I refuse again.
Him: ""You don't have a choice. You have to put that T-shirt on.""
Me: ""I do have a choice.""
Him: ""No, you do not have a choice.""
Finally sick of it, I snap: ""I do have a choice, actually, and my choice is to go home.""
He says: ""No, you can't leave in the middle of shift.""
Me: ""I can, actually.""
I walked away. Took the warmest shower when I got home. Cried. I was so mentally done, and I still felt cold hours later. We were expected to sit in the freezing rain for 8 hours - I only lasted 2. I knew I was completely done with this job, with the inhumane way I was treated.
I called my supervisor today to resign. He wouldn't accept my resignation. He's still messaging me, trying to convince me to go back to work.

But I'm done. I'm not going back. And this was only 2 weeks.

Edit for info: The supervisor who told me to put the soaked T-shirt back on was a different person from the team leader that bragged about his sexual conquests. I think the entire company is just rotten to the core.",4,1762465102.0,antiwork,1,1.0,False

I am looking to move out of London with my partner to somewhere quieter, like a larger town or more walkable city. I am desperate for some opinions/reccomendations of where to check out.

He loves BJJ and MMA, as well as film/history/art. I’m into crafty/artsy things and like to charity shop. We’re also both keen to go somewhere with a nice river to walk, or nice forests, etc, and I roller skate. I’m also very attached to coffee so would love somewhere with nice local cafes. I don’t drive, so walkable/transportable is pretty important.

We want to stay in the UK obviously; I used to live in Canterbury, and I absolutely loved it there for its smaller shops, artsy presence, and beautiful scenery. However, after a few years it started to feel a bit small/limited career wise so I moved to London. Now we’re looking for somewhere to settle a bit and live together with just ourselves for the first time (currently in a warehouse.)

We both work totally remotely, so that isn’t really an issue. A lot of people have told me Bristol, but I’m worried after looking into it that 1) it’ll be too big and feel just as busy/crowded/construction-filled as London; I’m autistic and constantly overstimulated here and 2) too expensive.

Similarly, though beautiful and has a good vibe, I worry that Bath would be too expensive but I’ve been once and it was lovely. I’ve also been recommended Norwich by a trusted source, which another trusted source soon vehemently disagreed, so getting a lot of mixed signals.

If anyone has any ideas/opinions at all on where would suit a good amount of these things I would love to hear your thoughts! Our monthly budget for rent would be somewhere around £1400.",1,1762464963.0,AskUK,10,0.66,False

Anyways midday arrived at work, 2:30 tops with a busy crowd of people. One is an old man who we call ""Sticky Joe"" balding looking past or at mid 40s, he talks to himself and lift his shirt up and talk incoherently but that's his mental not mines and he wanted to use the bathroom.

Me and another coworker tells him to stop and use the men's restroom cause hes a very much a passing masculine man.

I’ve been going there for a while and had a little crush on him pretty much from the start. Sometimes he’s really kind, other times a bit moody. Anyway, one day I was there with two friends (both f). He wasn’t working that day, but sitting inside the café with his laptop. We were sitting outside — my friends had their backs to the window, and I was facing inside. When he looked up, he smiled and winked at me. I was so confused and told my friends, but they thought I was imagining it.

Funny thing is, just a couple of weeks ago I remembered that moment while trying to fall asleep and thought it was super cringe — like, he was probably smiling at someone behind me (yeah… self-esteem level: zero 🥲).

Fast forward to yesterday: I was working from the café, got myself a coffee, and he was totally normal and friendly. But when I was about to leave — my friend was picking me up — I ordered two coffees to go. On my cup (the one with vanilla syrup), he’d written “with love”.

I was honestly shocked and tried to play it cool, and my friend did too, but as soon as we walked out, she immediately said, “Okay, he’s definitely flirting with you.”

1oqbhp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ethics/comments/1oqbhp8/ethics_in_healthcare/,Ethics in healthcare,"Hey so. Ive been trying to find a straight answer in all this and it's been challenging.  I work in a live in Addiction treatment center.  I am not a counsellor, therapist or social worker. I do not have those tags or education. I am what is known as a support worker.  I pour coffee, serve food and get the residents to their structures and appointments/other various tasks asked of me by management. During my time working there, we've been advised to not ad or have past patients on our social media or keep in contact, for atleast 1.5 to 2 years after they leave care.  UNLESS there was a previous relationship before they came in. Then in that case we would have boundaries in place during the client's stay to protect the patient such as no one on one interaction, lock out from patient medical records, etc. 

I recently had a friend whom I've known for a while come into the center for help, she completed and went on to the sober living program. She was on my social media,  had my phone number and we would talk prior to ever coming into care, it did at times bridge into being romantic.   To my understanding that was a pre existing relationship which should have no issues  remaining after as long as I've followed professional boundaries while they are in care.. 

After she left care and went to the sober living program, it came to my managers attention that her and i were on friends on there.   I'll admit I forgot to inform the management of the prior relationship before the client arrived, but when I  pointed out it was there my manager then said the prior relationship does not matter. And then pointed the social worker code of ethics out around relationships.    I have since removed them from my friends and stopped following.  I am at a loss cause the friendship means something to me. But so does my job.  I am not a social worker so I don't know the code of ethics he pointed out to me apply. And the policy of the workplace is patient care first. Do not cause harm to the patient, etc.     

I am trying to understand all this as this has wider implications then just her and I as friends. This affects any one I know before they come in the center for help.  Am I breaking ethics by having this friendship with this person after they have left treatment ? I know that dual relationships are not suggested in therapeutic relationships, but im not sure that my position would be considered therapeutic in any way? 

Thank you for your time. ",1,1762464413.0,Ethics,0,1.0,False
1oqbhh3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqbhh3,"Coconut, Flaxseed, Rolled Oats","Today I'm here to share with you some delicious cookies with wonderful, healthy ingredients that make snacks fabulous, a moment of great flavor. A week ago, I shared some flaxseed cookies. Today, these cookies I'm sharing include coconut and rolled oats, with a very pleasant result. When we bake cookies, besides spending a pleasant time creating and concentrating on the moment we're living, we also want them to be crunchy so we can savor the flavor of the cookie.

Now, let's look at the ingredients (you probably have them at home)

\-2 cups of wheat flour (you can use all-purpose flour; self-rising was used in this recipe; you can also use other types of flour)

½ cup of sugar

1/3 cup of vegetable oil

1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed

3 tablespoons of water (for the flaxseed)  
1 teaspoon of baking powder

1 teaspoon of vanilla  
½ teaspoon of salt  
2 tablespoons of coconut  
2 tablespoons of rolled oats

Add the water to the flaxseed and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens.

In this step, combine the oil, vanilla, sugar, and flaxseed after the required time has elapsed with the water. Beat well to combine all the aforementioned ingredients.

Now in another bowl, combine the flour, salt, baking powder, and the coconut and rolled oats.

We continue, combining the two mixtures until forming a moldable dough. If it feels too dry, add water or vegetable milk. In this preparation, water was used, approximately ½ cup.

This dough doesn't need to rest or refrigerate. You can immediately form balls of whatever size you want. Place them on a pre-oiled baking sheet, then use a flat container, or if you prefer, flatten the balls with your hands to form cookie shapes.

Bake for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Consider the type of oven you're using. I always emphasize that everyone knows their own oven. Baking these cookies may take less or more time for the reasons I described above.

Once baked, let them cool for a while. They're ready to enjoy with a delicious, freshly brewed coffee. If you're in a cold area, enjoy a delicious hot chocolate.

1oqbgxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/1oqbgxk/encountered_a_doppelgänger_at_my_childhood_home/,Encountered a Doppelgänger at my childhood home,"Just a little bit of a backstory we moved into this house when I was like 8 years old. Two ladies died in the basement bathtub before we moved in. We were poor and the house was cheap. One night we felt the house shake and me and brother’s pictures both fell off the fireplace and all the others stayed. The shower in the basement would always come on by itself or just the tub or floor would be damp and we NEVER used the bathroom in the basement. So I thought it was something paranormal going on. I have many more instances of the “spirits” making themselves known. 

Fast forward, I was at my mother’s house a few weeks ago and I’ve always had that bad feeling at the house like I was being watched or someone was always in the room with me since I moved out. I was over for dinner and I figured I’d clean up before I got going. While I was washing the dishes I heard my mom call me. So I went and asked her what she needed and she looked at me like “huh?” So I was like you just called me! She denied it so I played it up to me feeling nostalgic and remembering being called to get the remote. So I got back in the kitchen and I started sweeping. I heard my mom again but she was closer this time. So I look up at the door leading to the living room and I see my mom walking in the kitchen but she was walking into the door frame. Like I could see half her body and the other half was on the other side of the wall I couldn’t see. So as I paid more attention to what was in front of me I realized I couldn’t see her eyes. They were sunken in and had a black shadow over them. So I was like momma quit playing and I looked back to the pile I was sweeping up for a second and when I looked back up my mom was further back in the living room standing on the other side of the coffee table just staring at me. The room was dark btw so I called out to her again loudly but I heard her reply from behind me. I ran to her room and she was in the bed where she was the last time. Then I realized she had on a nightgown and the other mother was wearing a sleeping set. So I went back to the kitchen and tried to ignore the living room by keeping my back to it as I finished cleaning. Then all of a sudden I heard my mom whisper in my ear and say “I love you son” with a stroke to my cheek. My entire body locked up and filled with goosebumps. I tried to tell my mom but she ignored it. I think she deals with it enough living there for so long. 

I think this lady was one of the ladies who passed in the basement. From all my experiences in the home it seems like they were jealous of my mom. They were both single women with no kids. One of the ladies was pregnant at her time of death. I don’t know. ",1,1762464363.0,Ghosts,0,1.0,False
1oqbgmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1oqbgmv/finance_said_no_reimbursements_without_original/,"Finance said “no reimbursements without original paper receipts with wet signature”, so I mailed them 47 envelopes in a week and included stamps for my coworkers","I work at a nonprofit that pays staff back for small work buys. Coffee for volunteers, poster boards, bus fare to a site. For years we used a simple scan and upload flow in Expensify. New controller started in July and sent a policy email, all reimbursements must include the original paper receipt with a wet signature, no electronic copies, no stapled screenshots, no exceptions. Mail or hand deliver to HQ. Our team is spread across four cities and most of us do not even see the HQ except at the holiday party.



So I complied, but I made it easy for people. I built a tiny “mail kit” box in our supply closet with envelopes, 63 cent stamps, glue sticks, and a template cover sheet. I put step by step instructions on one page, item, date, vendor, purpose, sign in ink, tape the receipt flat, seal, drop. I shared it in Slack and said, finance wants originals, here is how we do it fast. Then I ran my own pile. Twelve bus stubs, three rolls of painters tape, a 9.99 dongle from the thrift store for a projector that saved an event. Every single receipt went into its own envelope because the policy said one receipt per request. I printed my name and code on each, and mailed them all on Monday at 8 05.

By Thursday payroll pinged me and asked why I had forty seven separate reimbursements under 20 each. I linked the policy line that says one receipt per request, no batching. He said the controller was getting a mound of mail and that the postage costs looked silly. I agreed cheerfully and said we are following the rule exactly. I added that I paid for the stamps from our supply budget so I would need a small top up. Then I walked to the lobby and handed three field coordinators little mail kits with a smile, because they already looked tired and I did not want them to eat the cost or stand at the post office after a long shift.

Fallout came the next Monday at 9 12. The controller scheduled a meeting titled reimbursement friction. She opened with a stack of my envelopes, it looked like a tiny white skyline. She said the auditors want originals, but the mail flood was not sustainable and the staff hours are a real cost. I said I understand, we want clean audits too. I shared a simple fix, keep originals for purchases over 75 or travel only, everything else can be scanned if the card last four digits and date are visible. I also showed a report from Expensify that tracks duplicates and fraud flags, which made her eyebrows lift. She asked for a week to revise.

New policy landed on Friday. Scan and upload for under 75, batch by week, one envelope only if the system rejects the scan. Originals for travel and high dollar items. The mail kit box stays for those, and I keep a few stamps in my drawer for new folks so they do not have to pay out of pocket. Finance thanked the team for patience. I thanked them for changing course.

No one yelled, no snark, just exact compliance with a hint of kindness. We still pass audits. And our field staff get their own cash back faster, which is the part that matters.",517,1762464344.0,MaliciousCompliance,26,0.88,False

Showdowns always bring more variance since the player pool is smaller and lineups tend to overlap, but hopefully this gives you another angle to work with.

# Chapter 1 

# Congratulations!

My day started out like any other. The ceiling fan clicked in an uneven rhythm above me, the same click that’s been there since I was a kid. I watched it spin, waiting for it to fix itself. It didn’t.

I swung my legs off the bed, careful not to topple the towers of VHS tapes stacked like some kind of  crooked city beside me. I like the way the old cases look together—*Videodrome*, *Blue Velvet*, *Brazil*—each one a relic from a better kind of imagination.

I turned on the TV and let the morning news chatter fill the quiet. Some anchor was smiling too wide about the Cold War being *officially* over, another story about this new “Internet” that was supposed to change  everything. The signal fuzzed every few seconds, and honestly, I preferred the fuzz.

The smell of burnt coffee and Lemon Pledge coming from upstairs was all too familiar to me, it's like the walls have been stained with it. I grabbed my backpack—half film reels, half textbooks—and climbed toward the kitchen and the start of yet another day. The house creaked in the same spots it always had, like it was sighing.

Dad was already at the table, same chair, same mug, same stare out the window. The radio sat beside him, silent. It used to play the same six pop songs every morning when Mom was alive. Now it’s just part of the furniture.

“Morning,” I said.

He grunted without looking up.

The mail lay in a pile on the counter: *Robert Kane, Robert Kane, Robert Kane…* then one envelope addressed in fading ink—*Elliot Kane.* Junk mail from some video-rental club in Portland. “At least Dad gets bills,” I muttered.

We shared our usual breakfast silence. Not hostile—just routine. He drank coffee; I spooned cereal. The clink of the spoon sounded too sharp.

“Work after class?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said with a weak smile. “Class First, Reel-Time Video then home.”

He nodded once. That was enough conversation for him.

I packed the bowl tightly into the dishwasher in a place that would require another wash later anyway. Then I was out the door. 

Outside, October air stung my lungs. Ashcroft, Maine smelled like chimney smoke and wet leaves. Black trash bags full of raked foliage dotted the curb like punctuation marks. I eased my rust-colored Toyota down the driveway and into another gray morning.

The drive to campus takes fifteen minutes if the lights cooperate. Same route every day: SuperSaver with an ever fading  green witch sticker stuck to the front window that somehow survives every season, the church where I learned funerals smell like lilies and rain, the high school that looks smaller every year, and the café that keeps changing names but never the menu.

Ashcroft’s a town that remembers you even when you’d rather forget it.

The college sits on a hill above the river—three brick buildings and a parking lot that floods every spring. 

I parked, shouldered my backpack, and made my way to the film lab, being careful to weave my way through the crowd. After I dodged the social minefield I made the trek down the many floors of the main building to the video room.

Professor Harlan was already at the front of the lecture hall, coaxing life out of a VCR that wheezed like a smoker. The other students filtered in after me, carrying the smell of coffee and damp notebooks.

Today was the Bi-Weekly public execution of the artistic mind. Film presentation day.

After watching this week's collection of small town interviews, campus event promotions, and sad attempts at short form comedy it was my turn.  I stood and held up my tape like it was proof of existence.

People yawned and groaned just at the thought of what I wanted to show them, like usual. 

It’s not my fault these people don't understand true moving artistic expression. 

“*Fragile Life,*” I said. “--A short study on impermanence.”

The lights dimmed. The TV screen flickered.  
A forest floor fills the frame—wet leaves, soil, a single thin twig trembling as if deciding its own fate.

*Snap.*  
The twig breaks clean in the middle.

Cut.  
A daddy-long-legs lies pinned to a chipped end table. Four silver sewing needles hold its legs in place like compass points. The spider trembles, its limbs straining against the metal.

*Snap.*  
One leg is plucked away.

*Snap.*  
Another—until the remaining limbs curl inward, the body tightening into a trembling fist.

*Snap.*  
A porcelain plate drops from above, smashing down, the spider disappearing beneath a perfect white circle that swallows the frame.

Cut.  
A river—overexposed, violent, water thrashing against stone. The audio distorts, too loud, the picture shuddering as if the tape itself is in pain.

Cut.  
A silent field. Still. Empty. A lone bird rises into frame, wings carving through the sky in slow, labored strokes.

*Snap.*  
The same field. Same angle.  
The bird now lies twisted in the grass, feathers ruffled by a wind that doesn’t move the trees. One wing is still extended, reaching toward the frame’s edge as if trying to escape it.

Black screen.  
A single exhale—soft, human, too close to the microphone.

Silence.

The room fades to a deep black until the lights turn back on like a flashbang. 

“Thank you,” Professor Harlan said finally. “Interesting technique. *Still* very… heavy.”

I shrugged. “Life is.”

He gave me that same smile, the one teachers save for students they’ve given up on. Someone in the back snorted out a laugh. I gathered my tape and sat down. “Maybe if they saw something with some substance they would get my work,” I mumbled to myself, defeated once again. 

They’d rather watch some action hero blow up a small town, or a classic romance where the girl hopelessly falls for the dumb jock. Simpletons, truly dull people who scoff at stuff that's real. 

By five o’clock, I was clocking in at ReelTime Video, Ashcroft’s last neon survivor. The sign buzzed pink and blue above the window, and the whole place smelled like dusty candy and warm plastic.

Claire was behind the counter, perched on a stool with her sneakers up on a beat up shipment crate of this week's promotional cutouts. This time it was a giant standee for *The Silence Of The Lambs*, which might have been a puzzle box from *Hellrasier* with how hard it was to make. 

“You’re late, Mr. Kane,” she said without looking up from her copy of *Rolling Stones.*

Claire and I had a buddy-buddy setup. She’d sneak out early to meet her boyfriend, leaving me to close the store—something Mr. Coleman would definitely scold us for.

But, it would even out because she would let me come in later without anyone raising an eye when I was working on a new short film. 

We were a real team of doing as little work as possible. 

“It's Mr. Kane now? Whatever you say Ms. Phillips,” I told her, throwing my bag of tapes into a corner as I joined her behind the counter. 

She snorted. “Shut up dude. It's dead in here. How was your class?”

“Fine.” I grumbled.

Claire stared at me blankly, “Yeaaaa, let me guess you showed them ‘True Art’ this time?”

Claire liked sunshine movies—*Ferris Bueller,* *Footloose.* 

I told her, “Light ruins contrast.” 

She called me dramatic and tossed a box of Junior Mints at me.

I caught it. “Critique accepted.”

We spent the evening alphabetizing *Hot Releases* and rewinding the same stack of returns. Parents wandered in from time to time, kids fought over *E.T.* versus *Gremlins*, and the local teens magically found a way to pocket a handful of candy bars on their way out. And, of course, the McCoy family came in, just for Mr. McCoy to somehow slip in a 18+ movie into the family's pile; the usual rotation of events. It’s predictable, it happens like clockwork, but I don’t get paid enough to care.

Despite our vastly different lifestyles, we talked for hours—about movies, about anything, about nothing. The silences were even calming. She called us yin and yang once. I didn’t tell her yin usually swallows yang by the end.

Fog had rolled in by closing time. Main Street blurred into soft halos of yellow light. I drove home through it, the wipers squeaking every few seconds.

The house looked asleep except for the TV glow in the main window. Dad had passed out in his chair again. A sweating glass of whisky was sitting on the end table beside him. 

Like every night, I reached down to pick up the glass and toss it into the sink. I then carefully threw a Patriots blanket over him, even though I knew it would end up on the floor. On the kitchen table sat a small cardboard box—no return address, my name written in thick red marker. 

A note beside it in Dad’s handwriting read: *A package came for you.*

I opened it. Inside was a single VHS cassette, black and unmarked except for a strip of masking tape:

**CONGRATS — YOU WON!**

I turned it over. No label, no letter. The plastic was warm, like it had been sitting under a lamp.

“Win what?” I said to no one.

Downstairs, the basement waited. My studio. My cave. Dust covered my shelves except for my old electronics. I slid the tape into the VCR and pressed *Play.*

Static filled the screen, then a burst of confetti. A voice came through, bright and distorted, like a game-show host trapped underwater:

“Congratulations, Elliot Kane! You’ve been selected for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!”

The picture warped, froze, and the text crawled from the bottom, “You have a talent for movie making…time to show us what you got.” 

A return address flashed for a few moments with instructions on when and how to send off my film for them to view.  Then the tape skipped off.

I stared at my reflection in the glass. The screen’s glow painted the room pale blue. For a second, it looked like the TV was breathing.

Then it went still.

“Huh. Might be that video club in Portland finally wanting to see my portfolio.” I said, staring at the screen. 

And for reasons I couldn’t name, I smiled.

# Chapter 2

# Return To Sender

I sat there staring at the blue glow of the TV a second longer than I probably needed to. The tape clicked, rewound itself into silence.

Then I snapped out of it. Right. Address. Opportunity. My shot.

I dug through my backpack and found one of the VHS tapes I’d used for class earlier that week. The *“masterpiece.”*

I tore a strip of thin cardboard from an old shipping box in the basement, folded it around the tape like a sleeve, and scribbled the return address I’d seen on the mystery tape across the front. The pen dragged over the surface, letters coming out shaky, like my hand didn’t totally belong to me.

I crumpled a few sheets of old newspaper I found by the washing machine—sports scores from three months ago, maybe older—and stuffed them in around the tape to keep it snug. It looked pathetic, but secure enough. Film students mail out worse things, I’m sure.

Outside, the porch light flickered like it always does. I dropped the package in the mailbox, lifted the little red flag, and stepped back like I'd just planted evidence instead of mailing a dream.

And just like that, I felt it.  
A pulse. Purpose.

Someone noticed me.

Morning came too early, like always. I dragged myself upstairs, still replaying the tape in my head.

I threw on some clothes laying around—either recently washed or so old they’d forgotten how to smell—and trudged toward the stairs again.

Dad was at the table, same mug, same blank stare out the window like he was waiting for the trees to explain something to him.

He didn’t look at me when he asked, “What was the package last night?”

“Oh.” I grabbed a clean-ish bowl. “It was nothing, just a video group from Portland reaching out. Probably some small film review contest I forgot I entered.”

He hummed, the closest he ever got to a laugh. “You always had… ambition.”

He said it like a compliment, even if it sounded like a memory.

For a minute, neither of us spoke. The light through the window hit the steam of his coffee like dust floating in a projector beam.

“You know,” he said finally, voice softening, “your mother always thought you’d do something creative. Said you saw the world in… interesting ways.”

I swallowed. “She said that?”

He nodded. His eyes didn’t leave the glass.  
“She used to tape everything you did. Birthdays, school projects. That art show in fifth grade. Remember that?”

I smiled under my breath. “The macaroni mess?”

“She called it abstract.” He chuckled, real, brief.

I didn’t trust my voice, so I didn’t say anything. Just shoveled cereal into my mouth and grunted a soft, “mhm.”

Mom had been the loud one. The bright one.  
She filled the house with sound.

Now breakfast was quiet.  
Comfortable, but hollow.

Eventually I rinsed the bowl, packed my bag, and headed out.

Same drive.  
Same fog lifting off lawns.  
Same world stuck on repeat.

Campus.  
Classes.  
Lectures about “How to fill a frame,” stuff I didn’t care about.

Every moment felt slower because all I could think about was that tape being watched somewhere in Portland. Maybe some weird basement film club with folding chairs and dusty screens. Maybe someone actually… seeing me.

Appreciating something that some people laugh at.

By the time my shift at ReelTime rolled around, I was practically buzzing. I walked in grinning like a lunatic, which was a mistake, because Claire immediately squinted at me like I'd joined a cult.

The neon flickered from the giant “ReelTime” sign out front. We settled into the routine—rewind, reshelve, complain about customers, judge people’s movie choices silently (or loudly if they walked away).

Then Claire yelled, “Uh, Romeo? You got mail.”

I turned.  
A brown paper-wrapped VHS sat in the return bin.  
My name across the front in the same thick red marker.  
**E L L I O T K.**

My stomach dropped and lit up at the same time.

“Secret admirer?” Claire wiggled her eyebrows.

“No, just… a video fan club that wanted to see my work.” I lifted the package. “They already sent something back?”

“How did it get here so fast?” I mumbled. “I sent it out this morning.”

Claire shrugged. “Quick shipment. My nana ordered a ThighMaster and that twenty-dollar piece of junk showed up in two days. How’d they know to send it here, though?”

“Well, the Portland Video Society doesn't have many Ashcroft members named Elliot.” I shrugged. “Plus I probably mentioned I worked in a crummy old ReelTime Video at some point. It’s not like this city has billions of them.”

Right then the door to the manager's office swung open and in stomped Mr. Coleman, arms crossed, glasses pinched down his nose like disappointment incarnate.

“No personal mail, Mr. Kane.” He snatched it.

“It’s not—”

“What have I told you?”

“It’s literally work-related,” I said, grabbing for it.

He tossed the package back at me like it was contagious. I barely caught it.

“Why must the only people who want to work be twenty-somethings who hate the rules?” he muttered, marching out the front door for the night.

Claire stared after him. “What an asshat.”

“Balding thirty-nine-year-old power trip,” I whispered.

We laughed. We stocked candy. We put movie after movie into the VCR behind the counter to play around the store.

I kept glancing at the clock.  
**9:12**  
**9:44**  
**9:59**

Claire flicked me in the forehead. “Go home. You’ve been staring at that package like it’s gonna whisper sweet nothings to you. And honestly? It’s freaking me out.”

“Yeah, yeah.” I grabbed my things.

Outside, Halloween had settled in for real this time. Foam tombstones littered front lawns. Fake cobwebs clung to trees like frost. Fog coiled through the streets, streetlights glowing soft and blurry.

I could barely feel the cold.  
Heat roared in my chest, excitement fogging the inside of my windshield as I drove home.

Whatever was on that tape—  
It was waiting for me.

And I wasn’t sure if I was ready,  
but I knew one thing:

I wanted it.

I rushed into the house and shut the door with my heel. Most nights, Dad would already be knocked out in the recliner by now, TV mumbling nonsense at him while the ice melted in his glass. But the chair was empty, and that felt wrong in a way I couldn't name.

Footsteps. The bathroom door opened. Dad came out drying his hands on his jeans, hair rumpled, shirt half-untucked like he’d been fighting sleep and bathroom lighting at the same time.

“Oh,” he said. “You’re home.”

“Yeah.”  
The package in my hand felt heavier just then, like it was something I wasn’t supposed to have.

He hung there in the hallway, trying to be casual but not quite knowing how.

“So, uh… how was work? Anything… fun happen?”

He always said *fun* like his mouth didn’t trust the word.  
“No. Nothing interesting.”

His eyes drifted, then landed on the package I was gripping. He tilted his head a little.

“That from the… Northland Video Society?”

“Close,” I said. “Portland. But yeah, something like that.”

He nodded — the kind of nod someone gives when they want to be supportive, even if they don’t fully understand what they’re supporting. The refrigerator hummed. The house settled. The quiet between us stretched out, familiar and a little sad.

“Well,” he said finally, voice softening just a shade, “I’ll let you… do what you do.”

He nodded toward the recliner — his nightly battlefield — like he was passing it back over to me. I stepped aside and he shuffled past, the floor creaking under his socks. By the time I reached the basement door, I heard the TV click on upstairs and the soft murmur of late-night hosts warming up their fake laughter.

Downstairs felt colder. The kind of cold you don’t notice until you walk through it. I tossed my backpack onto the bed and sat cross-legged in front of the VCR, the new tape resting on my knee like a pulse.

For a second I just held it. Let the weight sink in. Let the idea of being seen… breathe.

Then I slid it into the slot and pressed Play.

A blinding light burst from the screen, washing the whole basement in white. It was like the sun had exploded inside the TV.

Bold black words stretched across the brightness:

**WE LIKE WHAT WE SAW.**

A distorted, almost gentle woman’s voice read the words aloud—warm, patient, the kind of tone used in guided-meditation tapes.

She continued:

**DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO SEE SOMETHING REAL?**

The image clicked.

**WE CAN DO THAT.**

Then another jump—two words centered on the screen in thick block type:

**YES / NO**

The tape stayed there longer than the others had. The light hummed.  
I just stared, waiting for something to change.

“What the hell is this?” I muttered. My own voice sounded small against the static. “Uh… sure. Yes—”

The instant the word left my mouth, the letters vanished.

**OK.**

The screen went black.

The tape rattled inside the VCR, slowing, clicking, and finally spitting itself out onto the carpet.

For a second, there was nothing. Then—

The doorbell.

One chime, muffled through the floorboards. Then another.  
It mixed with the TV upstairs, but I could tell—it was the front door.

My chest tightened. I looked toward the stairwell. The bell kept ringing, sharp and insistent.

“Perfect,” I muttered, stepping over the piles of tapes. “Har-har, real funny. Perfect timing, but poor taste.”

I threw on the nearest jacket and climbed the stairs two at a time, still talking to myself. “Great prank. Wasting my time—”

Another ring cut me off.

I reached the front hallway, the sound echoing in the narrow space. Dad’s TV was still mumbling behind the living-room door; I lowered my voice to a hissed shout.

“Okay, okay! I get it—funny joke, now knock it off!”

I swung the door open.

No one.  
Not a soul on the porch. Not on the street.

Only a single box sat at the doorstep—small, brown, edges damp with fog. My name scrawled across the top in that same thick red ink.

1oqb9kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1oqb9kz/what_do_i_do/,What do I do?,"I’m upset with my friend. We have been friends for 4 years. This year she asked for me to be her bridesmaid. I am her only friend until she met my friends and became close. I did everything for her big day (hair, make up, two hen nights) Our parents were in the same club for years. There was no problem until I decided to have a renewal as I got married during Covid and couldn’t have a big wedding. Her mum expects a day invite but I said no as too many numbers and gave her an evening invite. She turned it down and said her granddaughter doesn’t do well with nighttime. She raises her grandchild with my friend in the same house (my friends niece) since then I have been guilt tripped over it and she even said I was waiting for my mum to have day invite to be able to tell me if she can make it to the night before drinks at the venue. When I told her how upset I was she said no problem I just want to be there for you. The next day she said I want to make a pact to not talk about the wedding until next year as you are getting stressed. She has since found out she is pregnant and said I can’t come to the evening as well. I then asked if she was going to be bridesmaid she said I don’t know. I can’t talk about the wedding but she can constantly talk about her pregnancy and wants help with her baby shower as I have always been an organised person. What do I do? Talking to her didn’t work and now she’s pregnant I don’t want to upset her so early. But I feel so much resentment. She also didn’t bother to come to my birthday and lied about a headache and then said the next day it wasn’t her thing to get a coffee in town and go shopping.

1oqb9dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1oqb9dl/big_juicy_birthday_sample_spree/,Big Juicy Birthday Sample Spree!!!,"The past couple months I've been on a super tight budget (senior in college) and with my birthday coming up, I'm finally treating myself to any samples I want!! These have all been on my try-list for a while so these are my first impression reviews:

**Designer/niche:**

**Snif Gentle Reminder -** Date sugar, black tea, milk, ube, lavender, palo santo. A really cozy, comforting vanilla. There is definitely a starchy quality to this that I will attribute to the ube, and it's very similar to Heal the Way. I've been enjoying this for bedtime!

**Akro Crush -** Almond, rose, lychee, macaron. I LOVE how this house does gourmands. Realistic and light, a little sweet, but not overly so. Their vanilla base comes off very fresh to me, which I like. It definitely smells like a rose macaron, with flakes of almond on top. The lychee adds a little brightness, but it overall leans pretty almond and rose. It's delicate and thin, just like the outer shell of a macaron. If you want to smell like a freshly opened box from Laduree, this is for you.

**Ellis Brooklyn Lychee Milkshake (body mist) -** Pretty basic fruity body spray scent. The fruity note comes through more to my nose as raspberry? There's a hint of vanilla, but nothing very ""milkshake"". A little bit of pink pepper. Pleasant, but not worth 2x the price of a Bath & Body Works mist. 

**Ex Nihilo Lust in Paradise -** FINALLY got my hands on a sample of this. Pink pepper, white peony, lychee. The first spray is a gorgeous burst of watery, fresh lychee. The pink pepper is there, and I think there's a little cedar coming through because it has a woodiness to it at first. That quickly settles into a soft, fresh peony, which stays the rest of the wear. It's gorgeous and to me, smells expensive. The lychee is a little too fleeting, and the dry down is a little generic. But somehow I can't get enough. 

**Diptyque Ilio -** prickly pear, iris, bergamot, and jasmine. The first spray is a really lovely clean, fresh, shampooey scent. It's green, but light. There's something a little green apple Jolly Rancher? Going on? That kinda goes away and then it just smells like sunscreen. Its pretty and refreshing but I'm not crazy about it. 

**History Thai Lychee -** Bamboo, green peach, honey pomelo, lychee, kaffir lime. I've been on the hunt for a super crisp, light lychee that is simple and undeniably **lychee**. Not peach, or pear, or just ""fruity"", but lychee jelly from a boba shop. That is what I get out of the bottle, and upon first spray. But it starts drying into something odd? Not sure if it's the bamboo, but there's something dusty, or medicinal, or something about it. Will keep trying.

**IRFE Marshmallow Musk -** Earl grey tea, lavender sugar, jasmine, marshmallow. Baby powder. How is this so expensive. There's an herbal hint, so I can understand the lavender and kind of earl grey? It's not very sweet, just powdery. I don't pick up very much marshmallow. It ends up just smelling like Secret Powder Fresh Deodorant. Such a waste for such a cool bottle!!!

**DefineMe Nearly Noon -** Cardamom cream, fig nectar, rice pudding, roasted coconut, saffron. Immediate coconut. A little bit of spiciness from the cardamom. The combination of the two strikes my nose as a Thai green curry with coconut milk? It's a little toasty as well. I can definitely see how all these notes listed combine into the smell I'm smelling. It's nice, but not something I really want to smell like. I'm really curious about Nearly Nude!

**Liquides Imaginares Blanche Bete:** Milk, ambrette, jasmine, vanilla. Imagine my excitement to try this, carefully decanting from the dabber sample to a spray bottle, getting whiffs of a soft, cozy, creamy goodness. SO excited to try this on skin... last few drops tapping out from the rim of the dabber.... i PROMPTLY knock the open spray canister over and it spills onto my desk. Okay, easy cleanup. I add a mini funnel and painstakingly scoop the liquid off the edge of my desk and into the funnel. I've recovered what can be recovered. I go to click the stubborn spray nozzle lid into place.... SPILLED AGAIN DIRECTLY INTO MY LAP !!!!! So what my wrist could absorb from the puddle on my desk is delightful. Creamy, cozy, but still clean and light. I get a little coconut, a little sandalwood, and not a lot of incense. It's been a few days and I keep sniffing my desk. I smell it every time I walk into my room. I'm in love. I promptly ordered another sample. 

**Indie Houses:**

**Sorce Snow Moon Magic -** Cookie butter, chai spices, lavender sugar, milk, marshmallow. Luckyscent has Sorce now!!! Another one I've been waiting to try. Smells like a tin of butter cookies. I love Sorce scents, I can somehow recognize every listed note but they're so well blended that I can't tell when one note stops and the other starts. It's a little powdery, but warm from the chai spices, and gently sweet. It's really pretty, but it's not as much as a hit for me as Match Made in Heaven or 2AM in Lafayette. 

**Haus of Gloi (oils) -**

**Litchi Milk Tea -** Pretty, but reads more ""red fruit"" than lychee specifically. It definitely smells like a fruit tea with coconut milk. My dream lychee is more watery and refreshing unfortunately. 

**Mango Sticky Rice** \- Tropical Yankee Candle. The sesame and rice components are toasty. Unfortunately I cannot shake the Yankee Candle of it all. I wish it was more realistic. 

**Marshmallow Rose -** Unsurprisingly, it's marshmallow and rose. Simple, sweet, pink. Perfectly balanced between those two notes. The rose note is reminiscent of rosewater, like the brand's own scent description states. The marshmallow adds a little powdery sweetness, but isn't overpowering. Pleasant and simple, not something I would gravitate towards or use often. 

**Troika -** Smells like the almond hand soap you find in public bathrooms. Pleasant & the nuttiness has more of a cherry facet than a true oats & nuts smell. I picked this after hearing Hannah Louise Poston rave about this scent on YouTube. Pleasant, but not a love!

**Pumpkin Butters:**

**Coffee Haus -** Literally the air in a coffee shop. Lightly roasted coffee, caramel. Definitely smells like a coffee drink I would LOVE. Been slathering this on before bed and living my Global Coffee House 2010s Panera Norah Jones life.

**Honeysuckle Lemon Curd -** Light, candied lemon that to me smells very refreshing. I don't get much honeysuckle, just a general sweet florality the longer the lotion sits. This formula is AMAZING. Moisturizing and satisfying but not thick or heavy!

**Pink Marshmallow Milk -** Every pink candy you've ever tried rolled into one. I don't particularly get marshmallow or milk? Something like gummy worms, maybe some vague watermelon, a hint of peach? Perhaps strawberry? A nondescript, relatively pink-ish, jumble of sweets. Nice but nothing particularly striking for me.

**Poesie (body mists):** I won't spend too much time on these because I was not very impressed with any of them for a house with SUCH imaginative marketing, imagery & notes. Not sure if it's because I got the body mists or just don't agree with these scents :/

Green Girl, supposedly an oatmilk matcha latte (funky). Madar, basmati rice with pistachios and rosewater (warm, tolerable). Village Bakery, inspired by Japanese milk bread (actually yes smells like coconut & bread). Innocence, peach skin & coconut milk (fresh, clean, forgettable).

**The Rundown:**

Like & will be exploring further: Gentle Reminder, Lust in Paradise, Thai Lychee, Blanche Bete, & Snow Moon Magic (also interested in more Haus of Gloi pumpkin butters)

Pleasant but not for me: Crush, Lychee Milkshake, Ilio, & Nearly Noon (the Haus of Gloi perfume oils are nice but don't think I'll be ordering more)

Didn't like: Marshmallow Musk & Poesie scents

Still on my sample list: 

\- D'grayi Jasmine Rice

\- One Day Taipei

\- D'annam Pomelo Oolong, Mooncake, & Princess of China

I got into work and Jeremey waited by the front door with an energy drink. “Welcome back,” I could still see the sleepiness that was mixed with a hangover weighing him down. 

I answered back with a black coffee trying to fix my own last night's drinking mistakes, “thanks.” I wiped the last remaining sleep that rested at the corner of my eyes. “What’re we doing today?”

“Don’t know yet. Just waiting for one of the owners to get here.”

Through a yawn I asked “Imhotep?

“Yeah. Depends on the day though.”

My mind recycled his words, “what?” 

Imhotep stuck his keys in the door, “good morning gentlemen.”

I jumped at his sudden appearance. 

Without missing a beat Jeremey asked, “how are ya Imhotep?”

“Having a fine start to the day.” He held the door open for us. “Thank you for dealing with Yanik’s head Steven.”

“Yeah, no problem. How’d you get there?”

“I unlocked the door.”

Jeremey piped up, “he’s just like that. Can’t see him comin’.”

“Perceptive as always Jeremey.” He was on his way up the stairs, “teach Steven on how to check the protective seals. As well as the equipment around the warehouse.”",1,1762463857.0,writingadvice,4,1.0,False
1oqb8qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/privatehealthcoveruk/comments/1oqb8qc/wearables_wellness_perks_the_latest_in_health/,Wearables & Wellness Perks The Latest in Health Insurance,"Hi everyone,

I've been digging into the way private medical insurance is evolving and thought I'd share a summary of what I'm seeing. It seems the whole model is shifting from being purely reactive (paying for treatment when you're ill) to something much more proactive and preventative.

The core idea is what some are calling 'shared value insurance'. Insurers are realising that a healthier customer base means fewer claims, so they're now actively investing in keeping us well. This creates a win-win: we get tangible benefits for healthy habits, and they manage their long-term costs.

A huge driver for this is the rise of wearable tech. With around 45% of UK adults now owning a device like a Fitbit or Apple Watch, insurers have a direct way to engage with our daily activity levels. They're linking data from these devices to reward platforms, which is a fundamental change from the old way of doing things.

It's not just about getting a discount on a new gadget, though. The wellness perks are becoming quite broad and are often the most valuable part of the package. The main types of benefits I'm seeing are:

- Activity-based rewards for hitting step or exercise targets, ranging from a weekly coffee to cinema tickets.
- Significant discounts on gym memberships and fitness programmes.
- Access to mental health support, including counselling sessions and subscriptions to apps like Headspace or Calm.
- 24/7 access to Digital GP services, which is a big one for convenience.
- Nutritional support, like consultations with dietitians or discounts on healthy food services.

Full disclosure: these insights are from a guide I work on.

I'm curious to hear what the community thinks. For those with policies that include these wellness programmes, do you find they genuinely motivate you to be healthier, or do they feel more like a 'nice-to-have' gimmick after the initial novelty wears off?

I like to think of systems like: When [THING] then I [DO THING].

I’ll give you some examples of mine, but I’d love to hear what ones you have in your life:

- When I take my gym clothes off to shower, then I put them straight into the washing machine 

- When I walk through the front door, then I empty everything out of my bag that needs to be emptied (water, lunch, etc. - if that bag is getting dumped on the floor, things will be forgotten about and not removed) 

- I’ve put my meds in the cupboard next to my coffee so in the morning when I make my coffee, then I take my meds

- When I start the washing machine, I leave the laundry doors open and turn the light on so I can’t forget that I have wet clothes in the machine 

- (This one only works some days) When I walk back inside after taking my dog to do his bedtime pee, I clear everything off the kitchen counter so I can start accumulating my crap on a fresh, empty surface the next day 

I know some of these sound super basic but I feel like discovering systems has been such a game changer for me. And now whenever I notice I keep forgetting something, I ask myself if there’s a way I can create a system around it. ",2,1762463770.0,adhdwomen,5,1.0,False

1oqb5tt,https://open.spotify.com/show/3OjK4Hhmd8WNjcg2HXk89K,I just launched my first podcast — breaking down real trademark clashes in plain English,"Hey everyone 👋

After months of drafting ideas between client calls and caffeine hits, I finally launched my first podcast — 🎙️ The IP Minute: Brand Battles & Inventor Stories.

It’s a short weekly show where I take real trademark & patent stories (like Mattel vs “Coffee with Ken”) and explain them in a simple, story-style format that anyone — founders, designers, or creators — can get value from.

🎧 Episode 1: When Barbie’s Ken Met Coffee with Ken
A podcast host named Ken started a show about life and coffee.
Mattel said, “That’s our Ken.”
They dropped the challenge… but with conditions: keep it adult-only, no toy talk.
It’s a fun case that shows how even simple names can become trademark landmines.

💡 Takeaways:
• Context is king — even a common name can collide.
• Big brands protect more than just products — they protect meaning.
• Sometimes, coexistence is smarter than conflict.

If you’re into founder stories, branding, or law made simple, give it a listen:

Would love your thoughts — especially on pacing and tone. This is my very first episode, so feedback from other podcasters and entrepreneurs would mean a lot 🙏

1oqb4er,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1oqb4er/i_run_a_small_remote_team_and_spent_our_swag/,"I run a small remote team and spent our swag budget on something nicer, it changed the whole mood","

I manage 9 people in data ops. We are fully remote across 4 states and two time zones. Every year I get a tiny swag budget, the kind that buys logo mugs that chip in the dishwasher or a hoodie that fits nobody. This spring the vendor catalog arrived and I stared at plastic tumblers again. Then I looked at our team chat. Two folks juggling daycare gaps, one person caring for a parent, one living above a noisy bar, two sharing a desk with roommates. I asked finance if, instead of swag, I could spend the same dollars on small things that actually make home offices work. They said, if it is the same money, go for it.



I called it the Comfort Kit. Each person got a 120 credit and a simple form. Pick exactly one thing that will make your day easier, send me a link, I will order to your address and write a note. No receipts, no lectures about approved vendors. The list that came back made me smile. One wanted a used Herman Miller footrest from FB Marketplace, another a basic Samsung 24 inch monitor, one chose a lumbar pillow and a hot water bottle, someone asked for a big plant light because their office corner is dark and the pothos was sad. I added one rule, choose what helps you focus or breathe. Then I pressed buy and wrote cards with goofy doodles.



We paired it with two policy tweaks. Quiet hours 9 to 12 local with no meetings unless customer facing. And a monthly 25 stipend for a third place if you need to escape construction or a toddler drum solo. Coffee shop, library room, cheap cowork day pass, you pick. I built the request as a fixed amount in Gusto so nobody files receipts for a latte, it just lands with payroll on the 15th. Total cost equals the old swag line plus 225 per month. Less than one software license nobody uses.



The fallout was immediate and so gentle. Cycle time on tickets dropped about 18 percent in the next sprint. Standups felt less rushed because folks were not scrambling from school dropoff to a 9 am block. People started sharing tiny wins in chat. A teammate sent a pic of her grandma trying the new headphones and giving a thumbs up because they muffled the TV. Someone posted a photo of their plant under the light with a caption, guys it is vertical now. I have a folder called good stuff and I put those in there for the days that feel like molasses.



One person wrote me a message that hit hard. ""I felt seen, boss. My chair does not hurt now."" That is the whole point. We still ship data at 3 am sometimes and there are outages and messy handoffs. But our team room feels kinder, and the budget that once bought mugs turned into a little safety net. I will bring it to our Q4 review and ask to keep it next year. If finance wants a KPI, I will bring the plant photo. It is very persuasive.

Hello folks, I (30, she/her) have recently relocated from London to Lisbon and have sadly had to say goodbye to my regular offline dnd party, so I'm posting here hoping to set up a new ongoing game and make new friends! I've got an initial idea for game cooking below (subject to change depending on group discussion), hit me up if you're interested. 

**About me and my play style:** 

I've played DnD for almost a decade, I've DMd for various one shots and an ongoing online campaign. I tend to run games focused on character driven storytelling, mysteries, exploration and intrigue and I like dipping in the spooky when the season calls for it. I also enjoy a good, complex combat with plot-driven stakes. Sillyness and shenanigans are very welcome, I'm happy to improvise and run with whatever crazy idea players feed me. I only ask for good times, good friends and snacks.

**The game blurb:** 

As Her Astral Majesty's Ship Invicta enters the space of Stray Rock, the infamous asteroid maximum security prison, you're sitting at the back of the convict transport area, on the lowest deck of the ship, bound hands and feet to other future inmates such as yourself. Each of you contemplates your future, with despair, anger or perhaps daring plans of escape, until the ship tilts violently to the side, and growls, yells and gurgling sounds begin to sound from above you. Bound and unarmed you watch as the heavy door separating you from the outside begins to shake and clawed fingers peek from between the heavy door panels. What do you do? 

**Logistics:** 

Send me a DM with a line or two about you and what you enjoy about dnd (or what you look forward to trying out if you're a newbie). Once I have about 4-5 players I'll organise a meet up in person to have a general vibe check. 

I suggest we run a one-shot to try the group on for size before actually getting to a session 0 for a longer campaign. In session 0, we'll discuss general table rules, triggers, veils and lines for the game, the setting and themes of the campaign and go through character creation. Timings and locations TBD by consensus. Game language will have to be in English for the moment because my Portuguese is sadly barely enough to order coffee. 

Thanks for reading, hope this strikes a chord with someone!

1oqazaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/baby_health_corner/comments/1oqazaf/skintoskin_benefits_for_newborns_the_power_of/,🌟 Skin-to-Skin Benefits for Newborns – The Power of Human Touch 👶💛✨,"🌼🌿🧡 **Why I’m Sharing This** 🌼🌿🧡  
After diving into countless medical journals (and drinking too much coffee), I can tell you with high confidence that **skin-to-skin contact is not just a sweet moment—it’s one of the most scientifically proven ways to support a newborn’s health.** Whether you're a first-time parent or just curious about why babies cling to your chest like tiny koalas—this is for you. 💬💗👶



🌸📘🤱 **What Exactly Is Skin-to-Skin Contact?** 🌸📘🤱  
It's simple: your baby, wearing only a diaper, is placed directly on your bare chest. No machines, no technology—just human warmth, heartbeat, and nature doing what it does best.  
**Fun fact:** Your chest can increase or decrease temperature by up to 1–2°C to warm or cool your baby. No app can do that... yet 😄🔥💓🌡️



🧠📊💞 **Why It Works – The Science (Explained Simply)** 🧠📊💞  
Here’s what happens during skin-to-skin contact, according to studies:

* **Heart rate and breathing become stable** – Your baby starts syncing with your heartbeat and breathing rhythm.
* **Body temperature stays regulated**, just like an incubator would do.
* **Stress and cortisol levels drop** for both baby and parent. Oxytocin (the love hormone) rises.
* **Breastfeeding becomes easier** – Better latching, more milk production, fewer tears from both mom and baby. Even WHO and UNICEF strongly recommend **immediate and continuous skin-to-skin right after birth**, especially during the first hour—the **“golden hour.”** 🕐🌍✅



👨‍🍼❤️🫶 **Is It Only for Moms? Definitely Not.** 👨‍🍼❤️🫶  
Dads, this is your moment too. Studies show **fathers also release oxytocin during skin-to-skin**, feel calmer, and form stronger bonds with their babies. No one cares about chest hair—your baby wants your warmth, smell, and heartbeat. 💓😄👶



🌙🧠🤍 **Does It Still Matter After the First Weeks?** 🌙🧠🤍  
Absolutely. Even after 3 months, skin-to-skin contact helps with:

* **Better sleep and emotional regulation**
* **Lower stress and cortisol levels**
* **Secure bonding and healthier brain development** You’re not “spoiling” your baby—you’re giving them emotional security and resilience. 🌱🫂🌟



⚠️🍼🔍 **Are There Any Risks or Things to Watch For?** ⚠️🍼🔍  
Skin-to-skin is very safe when done correctly. Just keep this in mind:

* Avoid it if you're extremely tired or likely to fall asleep.
* Baby’s head should be turned to the side with clear airways.
* After surgery or medication (like a C-section), ask your care team before starting. With basic precautions, it’s one of the safest, easiest, and most powerful bonding tools we have. ✅🤍👶

TL;DR: I'm on day 4 of being intensely POS during my rebound and it's starting to wear on me 😩 Luckily I am unemployed (woohoo) so I can fully rest and isolate without some dickhead boss breathing down my neck. But I still just want to get better!

**Illness course:**

I took the latest vax (Moderna) mid-September, and let my guard down mid-October because I was in the optimal protection window from the vax (yes I know vax does not generally PREVENT infection so much as hospitalization, but it does help _some_), community virus levels had decreased (bay area), and my friend was visiting town. Ate dinner in a crowded indoor space and a couple days later, here come the symptoms -_-

Two days after exposure (calling this day 0 of symptoms), slight cough starts. Next day (day 1), body aches and a slight headache, and then absolutely awful chills that night. Could barely sleep, kept waking up.

Day 2: I test today (the next day), and yep, a SUPER positive blaring and immediate red line. I call my doc and get paxlovid called in, which I take ASAP in the afternoon.

Day 5: day 4/5 of the pax round (it's 2x/day for 5 days), i start testing negative. Wahoo! But then...

Day 7: 12 hours after my last pax dose, a faint POS line. Crap, will keep up the rest and hydration and hope for the best.

Day 8: don't feel too bad, and test NEG, but this seems like a fluke because...

Day 9-Day 12 (today): super bright and immediate POS on all these daily tests. Have not experienced the awful chills, nor have I received any _new_ symptoms really, but the body aches and dull/background headache has pretty much persisted throughout. I did have some aching tooth pain on day 11 which was very annoying/irritating, but went away.

___

Really kicking myself for letting my guard down and getting some super annoying variant that seems to just ignore my vax and seems to have set up shop in my body, wrecking all kinds of havoc no doubt. I really want this shit out of my body. Prior to getting sick I was going to try to fly home for Thanksgiving and/or Xmas, but now that I've caught COVID not sure I want to chance air travel and indoor crowded situations (I'm the only COVID-conscious person in my family, and my sister is a doctor lol. Fuckin sucks).

___

**Current supplements:**

I'm currently taking vitamin C to try and help my immune system (not much evidence here but also couldn't hurt), and I already have vitamin D and K2 as part of my baseline regimen.

I've just started taking Magnesium, and have Potassium and Ashwaganda on order cuz, anything to help my body kick this at this point is welcome.
___
**Questions:**

* For anyone who's had it recently, how long did it take you to test NEG? Did you take Pax, and if so, did you rebound?
* Anyone have additional suggestions to expedite recovery aside from ""radical rest?"" I've been drinking coffee and playing videogames in the morning. Usually by the afternoon I'm feeling a bit too lethargic/fuzzy for active gaming and just watch stuff on the couch/doomscroll. Maybe I should cut out the gaming altogether, IDFK -_- Just nice to be able to do SOME things I enjoy while I'm trapped with this.
* Any supplement/food suggestions? I've been trying to keep my protein intake up. Luckily I don't have any gastrointestinal symptoms, I can pretty much eat what I want, and can taste everything. My last bout of COVID was way back in 2022 and I had really jacked up stomach issues. Stomach spasms that would wake me up in the middle of the night, that fucking sucked. At least I don't have that this time.

1oqavnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1oqavnw/hired_a_pro_got_useless_advice_bought_a_pdf_found/,"Hired a pro, got useless advice. Bought a PDF, found my competitor's weakest link.","The dream began at my kitchen table, on a laptop. “Wildflower & Oak” was no longer just a note on my phone. I had a logo, soy wax blends, and scents that reminded me of pine forests and rainy afternoons. I did not know how to tell anyone about it.  
  
I kept hearing about “brand strategy.” Every podcast said I needed one. So I went online and hired someone. His website looked sharp. He promised a “data-driven, holistic approach to market penetration.” He charged $1,500.  
  
He sent me a 40-page PDF. It was full of phrases like “leveraging synergistic touchpoints” and “optimizing the customer journey.” He said my target audience was “women, 25-45, with disposable income.” That told me nothing new. His competitor analysis was one bullet point: “You compete with other candle makers on Etsy and in local boutiques.” I could have written that myself. The document looked nice but gave me nothing useful.  
  
I felt stuck. My savings were low. My candles sat in boxes in the garage, smelling of bergamot and disappointment.  
  
One night, I found a different site. It was plain and direct. It offered a PDF for a small fee. I bought it.  
  
This guide was different. It talked about systems, not buzzwords. It gave me steps to follow. When I reached the competitor section, it asked for names. I had to pick three local and three online rivals. Then it told me to look closer.  
  
For my main local rival, “The Cozy Wick,” the guide told me to study their social media. I saw they posted twice a week, always in the afternoon. They never replied to comments. They used three basic hashtags. Their “About Us” page was a short, generic note.  
  
The guide then told me to do a “Customer Experience Audit.” I ordered a candle from each top competitor.  
  
When my order from “The Cozy Wick” arrived, I took notes. The box was plain brown. The invoice was a thermal slip. The candle came in bubble wrap. There was no thank-you note, no sample, no branding. It felt like a simple transaction.  
  
My order from “Scented Haven,” a popular online shop, was different. Their box had their logo. They included a handwritten note, but it was a pre-printed card that said, “Thanks for your order!” It felt corporate. Their social media had polished photos, but the captions were only emojis. There was no story.  
  
This detail changed my thinking. I was not just competing on scent or price. I was competing on feeling.  
  
I changed my plan. I posted on Instagram in the mornings, when my customer scrolled with her coffee. I shared the story behind each scent. “Rainy Afternoon” came from the smell of wet pavement after a summer storm, a memory from my childhood.  
  
When someone commented, I replied with a real answer. I asked questions and started conversations.  
  
When I shipped an order, I packed it with care. I used recycled crinkle paper. I wrote a thank-you note by hand, using the customer’s name and mentioning the scent they picked. I added a small sample of a new fragrance as a “sneak peek.”  
  
The guide did not give me a magic answer. It gave me a way to see what others missed. I saw the gaps: impersonal notes, generic posts, no story. I knew where I could stand out.  
  
Six months later, I packed an order for a repeat customer. My phone buzzed. It was a message on Instagram from the owner of “The Cozy Wick.”  
  
“Hey,” it said. “I’ve been seeing your stuff everywhere. You’re really doing well. Would you be open to stocking some of your line in my shop? My customers keep asking for them.”  
  
I looked around my garage. It was now a tidy workshop, filled with the scent of wax and success. I smiled. I had not found a strategist. I had found a system. By noticing the small things others missed, I built a business.[website was that](https://strategybyloop.com)",0,1762463036.0,smallbusiness,5,0.25,False

1oqav1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1oqav1s/manager_demanded_3_quotes_for_every_purchase_no/,"Manager demanded 3 quotes for every purchase, no exceptions, so I got him 3 quotes for everything","I am a product analyst at a mid size company. We used to have a simple petty cash rule. If you need office stuff under 50 you grab it, keep the receipt, and accounting reconciles on Fridays. Pens, hdmi cable, a mouse, coffee filters, done. New manager arrived from a consulting firm and sent an all hands email with a new procurement policy. All purchases must go through the portal, you must attach 3 competitive quotes, and there is a 5 business day approval window. He wrote, this will save us from waste. No exceptions. I asked if the rule applies under 50. He replied, the rule applies to every purchase.



So I complied. That afternoon a client asked for a live demo on a big screen in our conference room. We were missing an hdmi cable because ours had walked away during a training. I opened the portal and submitted a request for a 9.89 cable. Quote 1 from Amazon, quote 2 from Best Buy, quote 3 from Monoprice. Uploaded screenshots, filled cost center, attached the security sheet from IT because the form would not submit without it. The system returned a due date of next Thursday. I brought my own laptop and narrated the demo with my screen tilted so the client could kind of see. Not ideal.

For the next week I followed the rule exactly. Whiteboard markers ran out on Tuesday. I filed a ticket with 3 quotes for a 7.49 four pack. Same for coffee filters, batteries for the laser pointer, a usb c adapter for our intern, and a can of compressed air because the space bar on one keyboard felt gummy. I logged my time in our tracker under admin. Fifteen minutes to find quotes, ten minutes to crop screenshots into one pdf, five minutes to argue with the portal because it hated png files. I rounded up to the nearest quarter hour like finance asked. The total for that week was 6.25 hours.

Finance pinged me on Thursday morning. Why did your code show six hours of procurement admin. I replied with links to my tickets and my original question about the threshold. They went quiet. At 3 pm the manager Slacked me, can you just grab the markers today. I said I can when the ticket closes. Policy says five business days. He wrote back, fine, ask facilities. Facilities said they also follow the portal now.

Fallout arrived Monday. Finance asked the manager to review a spreadsheet of small ticket items across the team. Thirty two requests under 25 had stacked up. My 9.89 hdmi cable was still pending because the approver was out sick and the system would not let a backup approve without a delegation form. The client escalation went to our director who asked why we missed the big screen again. I forwarded the email that says no exceptions.

On Tuesday the policy changed. Purchases under 100 can be bought by card holders with a receipt. No quotes. Approvals happen after the fact in the monthly rollup. The manager waved me over in the kitchen and said we could have just talked. I said we did, on day one. Then I bought the markers, the cable, and a stupid amount of coffee filters, because apparently that is how we save money here.

Within minutes—success! Deep, peaceful sleep.

Enter Dad from the gym. He freezes at the sight of his sleeping child, eyes wide and smiling.

I whisper, “I’ll put her down so we can eat.”
He insists, “No, I want to hold her. I can do it.”
I hesitate and tell him she might wake up but he looks determined (and slightly offended), so I give in.

He takes her, carefully… sloooowly… and as I predicted, her eyes snap open.

Now we’re (but mostly me if we look at it in every POV) both trying every trick in the book: rocking, shushing, patting, hand-kissing (why??). She’s tossing, turning, crawling toward me for backup.

Finally, he sighs, “I have to shower before work.”
And just like that, he disappears—leaving me with one wide-awake, grumpy baby and zero coffee in my system.

""Ish"" because of my first ""meal"":

Meal 1 (8/9am) is a keto-friendly Bulletproof Coffee shake (ik ik), consisting of half a scoop of whey (to avoid majorly spiking insulin), MCT oil, heavy cream, coffee and hot water. I love starting my days with this and appreciate that this could be considered as half a meal, but it's still pretty light all things considered.

Meal 2 (1/2pm) consists of your usual carnivore staples (could be a mix of steak, mince, chicken thighs or drumsticks, eggs, pork belly, salmon etc.). I get hungry during this time and eat until I'm full and don't think much about it, just as Dr Anthony Chaffee advises. I also really want to be over calorie / protein counting and not do that again as I've been doing that for years.

Now some days I get hungrier for evening meals (especially if I work out at some point during the day), but sometimes I'm just not hungry and inadvertently do OMAD(ish). I like this flexible, instinctual, non-regimented way of eating.

Does anyone who lifts weights and bodybuilds have experience with increasing strength and building lean mass while eating this kind of way? Is it advisable to force more food into my single meal, or even add another meal when not hungry for more (which kinda goes against the whole thing)?

In the last 5 days his daytime sleep has gotten progressively worse. He was never a great sleeper, but this is my nightmare.

We do bedtime wind down after his 6pm witching hour, which he usually kicks off after his 6pm feed and runs it until 7-7:30. In that time my husband tries to soothe him while I do my bedtime stuff.

Then I typically feed him again around 8. He’s then usually asleep by 9pm. He usually sleeps until midnight. 

Then from midnight to 8am (used to be 10am) we wakes up every 2-2.5 hours and wants to eat, so I change him, feed him, and then burp and soothe him and let him sleep on me for 15 or so minutes before I lay him down. He’s usually pretty efficient at all of this so he will eat and be back to sleep in 30-40 minutes.

Then at 8 (used to be 10 😭) he wakes we’ve diaper, feed, burp, eye contact and chatting/enrichment, then attempt to soothe back to a nap by 9:30 at the latest. Apart from the feeding, my husband usually takes this shift before he heads off to work. 

Then baby and I are awake again around 10:30. Baby and I rinse and repeat all day until 6pm.

However over the last week he is fighting daytime sleep so hard. He woke at 7am today instead of 8… only an hour for his last ‘nighttime’ sleep… yay 😵‍💫. And it took me until almost 10 minutes ago to get him back to sleep and it’s on me. He was wide awake until my husband went to work, and I couldn’t sleep either so I just gave up and had coffee with my husband and our little non-sleeper.

I actually got him to sleep 1 other time this morning for about 10 minutes…but the moment I tried to lay him down he woke up and screamed at me. Because his nighttime sleep/feed routine really doesn’t allow me much sleep (since part of his sleep is on me, and yes I have tried to skip this step and it has 100% of the time ended badly) I really relied on his daytime naps for that tiny sliver of peaceful time to myself.

Even if the time to myself is spent doing chores, it still helps my overall well-being.

Please someone tell me this will pass. I do all the things, quiet/dark sleep space, ensure he’s fed and his diaper is fresh, tried swaddle (hates it since about week 5). Shushing. Holding tightly. Rocking/bouncing. He just hates sleeping during the day. I used to wear him and go for a walk to get him to sleep but these days he’s too alert for that.

Ugh. This tiny terror will be the death of what is left of my sanity. Why did I decided to procreate? ",1,1762462551.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

1oqajv8,https://i.redd.it/v2l3ltv99pzf1.jpeg,SURPRISE AION2 LIVE BROADCAST SUMMARY,"The surprise AION 2 live broadcast opened with a relaxed and cheerful tone as producer Son Yun-seop and lead developer Kim Nam-joon greeted fans before the official launch. The developers explained that this unplanned stream came about because fans had been asking constantly for another broadcast, and they wanted to share updates before the G-STAR event. Originally, they had intended to do a live show at G-STAR, but network concerns led them to host this online session instead. The two reminisced about the NVIDIA showcase where AION 2 had received an overwhelming response, with long lines of fans waiting to try the demo. They admitted to being surprised by the turnout, and even bought coffee and hot chocolate for people waiting in the cold. This time, they promised that the G-STAR booth would feature far more demo stations and space so everyone could try the game comfortably. They also celebrated a personal milestone, having surpassed 120,000 YouTube subscribers and received the Silver Play Button, which they proudly unboxed on stream, joking that they would keep streaming until they earned a Gold one too.

The focus of the broadcast was to showcase new gameplay, especially the control systems and four unrevealed classes. AION 2 introduces two control styles—AION 2 Mode, which uses a free-aim reticle to deliver a more action-oriented, console-like feel, and AION 1 Mode, which preserves the traditional MMORPG cursor system familiar to fans of the original game. Players can freely switch between the two and adjust targeting options, lock-ons, or even play using a gamepad in limited beta support. Kim Nam-joon demonstrated these systems in real time, using the Gladiator class to show off targeting, locking, and camera movement.

The team then revealed four major classes that will be available at launch: Gladiator, Templar, Cleric, and Sorcerer. The Gladiator was described as a flexible all-rounder with both melee and short-range attacks and a satisfying sense of impact. It can leap toward enemies, unleash wide-area slams, and absorb life when traits are built accordingly. The Templar served as the dedicated tank, capable of pulling enemies, stunning them, and protecting allies with shields and defensive auras. A standout feature was the extending weapon system known as “Neul-Mu,” where weapons physically stretch to strike from a greater distance, a visually striking mechanic available to every class. The Cleric, though focused on healing, could also hold its own in battle with damaging spells like Lightning of Judgment and supportive abilities such as area heals and cleansing spells. During this segment, the developers delighted viewers by showing the whimsical octopus mount, which quickly became a fan favorite. The Sorcerer followed as a powerful elemental caster capable of blending fire and ice, alternating between high single-target damage and wide-area crowd control. Many of its abilities can be cast while moving, adding to the game’s fast and dynamic style.

The developers also showcased additional systems that define AION 2’s gameplay. The iconic flying mechanic returns with a variety of wings, each with its own appearance and stats. Importantly, wings purchased with real money are purely cosmetic, reflecting the team’s commitment to “selling looks, not power.” They also presented the Daevanion system, a large upgrade board reminiscent of a skill tree that allows players to customize stats, passive bonuses, and skill enhancements by spending points earned through leveling and gameplay. It features multiple branches with unique focuses on speed, critical damage, or multi-hit effects, as well as distinct PvE and PvP variants. Resetting points costs only in-game currency, ensuring accessibility without paywalls.

Another returning feature is the Titles system, now with over 300 titles obtainable through achievements, exploration, and challenges. Titles offer passive stat bonuses or purely cosmetic prestige, such as honorary titles for first clears. Mounts and companions were briefly shown, including elemental spirits and flying whales, all of which can be obtained in-game. The economy centers entirely on the in-game currency, Kinah, used for resets, upgrades, and crafting. Manastones, godstones, and other upgrade materials come from gameplay rather than the cash shop, reinforcing the developers’ goal of maintaining a fair system.

A large portion of the broadcast was devoted to pre-launch details. Pre-download begins on November 16 at noon, character customization opens at 2 p.m. the same day, and the global launch occurs at midnight on November 19. They explained that pre-download starts earlier to allow time for new server expansion since earlier pre-registrations had filled faster than anticipated. Despite this, some queue times may occur at launch, so four new servers—two Elyos and two Asmodian—will open on day one. Players must install NC’s PURPLE launcher and reach the customization screen to lock in their character slot. Exiting the screen cancels the reservation, but those who already created characters in October can customize at any pace. Each account can pre-create one character, though more slots will unlock after launch.

The developers also described what fans can expect at G-STAR in Busan, where AION 2 will occupy one of the largest booths with playable content including the Urugugu Dungeon and full character customization. Visitors can also view exclusive trailers at the NC Cinema, relax in themed seating, and receive items like mousepads and in-game coupons.

The conversation eventually turned toward monetization. The developers were open about AION 2’s paid features, explaining that there will be two battle pass tiers sold in Quna, the premium currency, with one costing around 1,000 Quna and another 1,500. Both last for about two months and provide only cosmetic rewards such as costumes, accessories, and mounts. They also introduced a membership system functioning as a convenience subscription. Membership grants access to trading and the market, while non-subscribers cannot use those systems. Combined packages of both membership and battle pass cost about 45,000 KRW. The team then showcased the in-game shop live on stream, displaying various outfits including maid uniforms, school attire, padded jackets, and dragon wings. Every item is permanent, with time limits referring only to sale duration, not ownership. A unique in-game feature called the Black Cloud Trade Company replaces random loot boxes with a rotating shop that refreshes every few hours, offering items for Kinah instead of real money.

Numerous other gameplay details were clarified throughout the show. Dungeons can be run a limited number of times per day, there is no auto-combat or auto-loot, and there will be no large-scale siege content at launch. Guilds, or Legions, are capped at forty members and lack leveling or guild-versus-guild combat systems for now. Kinah and Quna are shared between characters on the same account, and crafting, gathering, and Aether harvesting return as key life-content systems. Players can even fall mid-flight if stamina runs out, just like in the classic AION. Post-launch updates will add full UI customization, allowing players to freely move interface elements. Global players can access the game without IP blocks, though latency and verification steps might limit overseas play. Emulator use, however, will be restricted to prevent bots.

During the open Q&A, the developers fielded hundreds of questions from viewers. They reaffirmed that AION 2 would remain a manual gameplay experience, rejecting full automation. PvP balance between factions is symmetrical, with no mechanical differences between Elyos and Asmodians. Each server has its own marketplace to prevent inflation. Character customization is extremely flexible, including free gender toggling and a marketplace where players can sell their own designs, receiving a share when others purchase them—hence the small fee for makeover tickets. Controller and mobile play are supported, the game offers multiple voice packs, and future classes such as a minstrel-type are being considered depending on community response. There are no housing systems at launch, but a Christmas event and seasonal outfits are already being prepared. A “Perfect Dodge” mechanic rewards precise evasion with visual feedback, while Snapshot Mode allows players to take stylish photos that retain their customization data for uploading to the in-game style shop. The developers promised continued optimization and close monitoring against bots and exploiters. They ruled out server transfers and mergers, emphasizing that server populations are already strong, exceeding twenty thousand users per server during testing.

Near the end of the broadcast, the developers revisited monetization one last time, showing the shop once more and assuring viewers that everything purchasable for real money is purely cosmetic. They even showcased some fun items like plush shoulder pets and vegetable accessories purely for humor. AION 2’s internal “Black Cloud Merchant” system lets players spend Kinah to buy cosmetic or functional items that appear on a timed rotation, further reinforcing that most acquisition paths exist in-game.

1oqajt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oqajt7/tips_for_cleaning_brass_burr_carrier_ascaso/,Tips for cleaning brass burr carrier [Ascaso I-steel i-1],"I recently bought an older Ascaso I-steel i-1 grinder from a marketplace for €10. Great deal for a grinder that's built like a tank and of which ""new"" models are sold for like €400.

Anyway, I'm trying to clean the thing and it seems like the previous owner never ever cleaned it. And my god, is it horrible in there 😂

So, first I had to use a screw extraction set to remove the screws from the upper burr, because they were so incredibly stuck (and stripped due to my incompetence trying to get the unstuck). 

After having succeeded at that I had to actually break free the upper burr (it was also stuck) and found what can only be described as Satan's tar pit underneath.

The burr carrier is covered in very thick coffee sludge/oil/whatever and I want to clean that stuff off. The thing is made of brass, like the one on the left here: https://www.euroquick.nl/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/molinos-fresas-planas.jpg

1oqaj5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditor_Updates/comments/1oqaj5o/update_aitah_for_asking_my_wife_to_choose_between/,Update: AITAH for asking my wife to choose between her family and ours,"If you’re interested in how we got here: [my last real update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Redditor_Updates/comments/1o1ivs7/update_aitah_for_asking_my_wife_to_choose_between/). And all the rest are in my post history.

I realized today that it's been almost a month since I gave an ‘official’ update. A lot has been going on, including Ellie’s visit, a few breakthroughs in therapy, and trying to manage a household with a toddler with a serious medical condition. I’m still processing/working through a ton, but since Ellie was here, I had a little less need to process in “public”, as it were.

But now she’s gone back home and things are sort of shifting back to where they were before the seizure and CPS except that I don’t really feel like I’m looking at any of it the same way, whether that’s good or bad, I don’t honestly know yet.

We still don’t have any real answers as to what’s causing my son’s seizures. But his new medication regimen has them more or less under control and we’re cautiously optimistic while still taking some extra precautions. So far, so good on that front. He’s handling it all far better than either of his parents are, I can tell you that.

I got a few comments and msgs asking about whether I ever spoke to BIL after he reached out.  We had a brief chat over coffee the day before Ellie arrived. He and I have never been close - he is or was the golden child son-in-law and we have absolutely nothing in common - but, apparently, he still felt like it was his “duty” to warn me about some things, so I could be more prepared than he was. Turns out that my SIL has been financially abusive/controlling toward him for quite a while and when he confronted her about a credit card that he didn’t know she had opened, she went ballistic and *that* was what led her to the bar and a guy she used to know and it went from there. He didn’t expand much on SIL’s cheating so I’m still not clear if it was a one-time thing or a long-term affair (Carrie’s had conflicting answers) but really, he just wanted to give me a heads up so I could check our finances in case Carrie had been following her sister’s lead in that regard.

So, I did check. And that led to a blowup in MC because I found some… irregularities. No secret credit cards or anything like that. But Carrie’s been spending considerably more than I realized and some of that spending was actually *giving*, as in giving SIL cash that I suspect was her way of paying for her cheating related expenses so BIL wouldn’t catch on. It didn’t go particularly well when I called Carrie out on it during counseling and it went worse when our therapist essentially took my side and gave her some tough love that was more tough than it was love. The phrases ‘family loyalty’, ‘she needed help’, and ‘you made the choice to get fired so I get to make the choice on how to spend *my* money’ were all thrown around. 

To be fair: Carrie apologized later for everything she said, though she stopped short of apologizing for what she *did* and her sister’s cheating has become a bigger issue in MC than I ever thought it would. We’ve had three sessions since the blowup and somehow they all keep circling back to the cheating and all our talking about what Carrie knew and what she didn’t feels a lot like dancing around the possibility of her following in her sister’s footsteps and the money stuff being the first step down that path.  And *that* somehow always manages to lead right back to her original accusations against me, the ones that led to her mom snitching to my mom but then never following up with the truth.

There were some commenters who suggested that Carrie might have been setting some kind of ‘trap’ by inviting Ellie. I’m not going to say you were right but, well, you were right. Sort of. It was more of a preemptive strike, a ‘see, I trust you’ and ‘look, I can still do things that *suggest* I might still love you’ move as the day after Ellie left, Carrie broached the subject of how her mother telling my mother that I had cheated had played a role in my mom reporting me to CPS (there’s a sentence I never thought I’d write.) Basically, my wife asked me to be the bigger person (like she’d been by inviting Ellie) and to chalk that up to an innocent mistake on my MIL’s part and now that it was all water under the bridge because everyone knew the truth, maybe my MIL and I could have a sit down and try to bury the hatchet. 

I had like six good lines about where I might like to bury that hatchet, but I didn’t actually use any of them and that was in no small part to being too fucking *shocked* to hear it described as water under the bridge to find my voice. 

Carrie did her best to frame it as all of us moving forward “for the kids” since it seemed like our son and daughter might soon only have one set of grandparents, assuming that I was going to go no contact with my parents. Someone asked on one of my other posts why it wasn’t ‘easy’ for me to just cut them off and *this* turns out to be one of the big reasons: 

* If I go no contact and Carrie and I stay together, then my entire family will be *her* family and I think I’ve spelled out all the reasons that would be an incredibly *bad* idea for me.  
* If I go no contact and Carrie and I divorce, then I’ve got no one except a best friend who is thousands of miles away and two kids who I’ll only see some of the time. 

My therapist suggested that *that* might have been my mom’s plan all along, or at least a consideration - the idea that I’ll roll over and forgive and continue to play my role because I’m incapable of being alone or standing up for myself. She took an action that was so insane because she fully believed there would be no consequences to it, at least not for her. 

Not to speak poorly of myself, but I have to admit that wouldn’t have been an unreasonable calculation by my mother. And since I haven’t ‘officially’ gone no contact yet, she probably thinks that it’s only a matter of time before I come crawling back.

A month ago, she might have been right. But I’ve been digging down into everything related to my parents in therapy and doing all my ‘homework’, which has essentially been a lot of journaling (some of which ended up as a Reddit post) and talking to my inner child and confronting the pain without actually confronting the people who caused it. Turns out that all my posting on here was me doing some of that in terms of my marriage even though I didn’t realize it at the time. And *that*, it seems, is a pattern: me not realizing things. While Ellie was here, she and I talked a lot and she pointed out some things (in much less gentle ways than my therapist does) that I hadn’t noticed, some patterns that exist in my relationships with my parents *and* with Carrie. Ellie described them as patterns of neglect, at best, and patterns of abuse, at worst.

I pushed back and resisted that, at first. But when I shared it with my therapist, expecting her to agree with me, she guided me into considering it a light I hadn’t thought of before. She asked me, point blank, who the person I trust most in the world is (Ellie) and then she asked me if I trusted her that much, why wasn’t I trusting her judgement, why was I fighting so hard against everything Ellie was trying to tell me.

My answer: because Ellie’s *supposed* to be on my side so, of course, she’d see it all in a way that made me look good or like the victim so how could I trust such a clearly *biased* opinion? And then my therapist asked me if I felt so strongly that I couldn’t or shouldn’t trust a biased or self-serving opinion, then why was I so dead set on trusting Carrie’s opinion or my mother’s. 

I had no good answer for her. Hell, I had no answer *at all* for her. And I still don’t. But I need to find one, as that’s my therapeutic homework for next session: to try and find a reason that I can actually defend for why I will just accept my wife or my mom’s views of me without question, but refuse to consider that my best friend might see things more clearly than either of them do. I’ve been working on it since Tuesday morning and so far I’ve got nothing which, I suspect, is the point.

That’s where I’m at, if anyone still cares. And I do want to say thank you to everyone who reached out with comments or messages on my other posts, especially those who shared experiences with their own families. I haven’t ever really talked about any of this before, so it’s helped a lot to hear that I’m not unique and while that’s depressing to an extent (why can’t we have nice families?) it’s helping me to feel slightly less anxious about it all. I know I don’t reply to messages, but I read them all and they mean more than you know. 

tl;dr: SIL was financially abusive, my wife gave her money and made me out to be the bad guy for being upset. Carrie wants me to make up with her mom after the cheating accusations. I haven't gone NC with my parents yet because I'm afraid of being alone and Ellie and my therapist both think there are patterns of abuse in my relationships.

1oqahnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oqahnh/daily_driver_beans_recommendation_germanyeurope/,Daily driver beans recommendation (Germany/Europe),"
Hi everyone,

You’ve all been a fantastic guide on my coffee journey — so thank you!
Here’s where I’m at: I absolutely enjoy beautiful, vibrant speciality beans (medium roast and above) and all the flavour adventures. But for my every-day drink — mostly a milk-based cortado — I find myself really enjoying a classic, chocolatey dark roast. It feels comfortable and satisfying.

Here’s the kicker: getting fresh bags from speciality shops is becoming really expensive for everyday use. So I’m looking for your help in two parts:

1. *Every-day budget dark-roast recommendations*
I’m in Germany / Europe, so I'm thinking supermarket or easily available brands: maybe Lavazza, Tchibo, Melitta, Dallmayr (or others). What chocolatey, dark-roast beans or blends would you recommend for daily use — something more affordable, yet still decent?


2. *Getting the best out of cheaper beans*
If you use more economical beans, do you brew them differently, adjust grind/ratio/recipe, or pair them more with milk or milk-based drinks to get more out of them? Any tips for maximising flavour with budget beans?



And yes — I’m wondering: is this even a feasible pursuit? Or am I settling for something that always tastes “less good” ?

Thanks in advance for any recommendations and tips! Looking forward to your thoughts.

1oqafgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MiddleClassFinance/comments/1oqafgz/we_stopped_doing_monthly_budgets_and_built_a_12/,"We stopped doing monthly budgets and built a 12 month plan instead, stress dropped and our cash finally behaved","HHI about 148k in a HCOL suburb, two kids in elem school, one car paid, one on 3.4 apr, mortgage 2.9 on 2,050 a month, daycare is gone but camps and sports still hit weird. For years we did neat monthly budgets that looked so tidy in Google Sheets, and every single time the car insurance renewal or the big winter gas bill nuked the plan. We would swipe the card, tell ourselves we will fix it next month, and then Costco and birthdays and dentist would laugh at us. It wasnt that we overspent daily, it was that our expenses arent monthly, our budget was pretending they are.



In Januray we tried something different. We listed all non monthly stuff on one sheet, by the exact date. Insurance in March, tags in May, sports fees in August, property tax in October, annual subscriptions sprinkled around. We totaled it, got 9,860 for the year, and divided by 12, that is 822. We opened a boring high yield savings nicknamed Lumpy and set an auto transfer for 825 on payday. Then we removed those lines from the regular monthly budget, so the monthly view is just what truly repeats, mortgage, utilities, groceries, fun, givng, plus a small cushion.



Two unexpected wins. First, cash flow smoothed out. When the car insurance hit for 1,146, I paid it from Lumpy, shrugged, and moved on. No card float, no guilt spiral. Second, we got more realistic with groceries and fun becuase the budget stopped lying that we can afford all months equally. Our true monthly spend is 6,120, not 5,300 like the old sheet pretended, and that honesty actually calmed me down. I can hit 6,120, I keep missing 5,300.



A few tweaks helped. We set quarterly money dates, 30 minutes on a Sunday, we sit with coffee, skim the calendar, and adjust the Lumpy transfer if needed. I built a dumb rule, if an expense happens once or twice a year, it belongs to Lumpy, not the card. We also pre saved for December by bumping the transfer by 50 from September to November, because holidays always behave like a bossy cousin who shows up early. Paying in full made the renewal discounts show up too, small but real.



This is not fancy, it is just accounting for timing. But im sleeping better and our credit card balance now goes to zero every month. Numbers are flatter, feelings are flatter in a good way, and I finally stopped being mad at myself for not winning a game that was set up wrong. If your monthly sheet keeps exploding, try the 12 month picture and a Lumpy acct, it might be the most boring miracle of 2025.

On a random Tuesday I baked banana bread that went a little sideways, too much cinnamon, and carried it to the park near my apartment. I posted in the local Facebook group, if you work remote and want a quiet hour, I will be at the blue table at 8, free slice, bring your laptop. I expected zero humans. Two showed up, a city planner who reviews permits, and a new grad doing customer support from a Chromebook that had one flaky usb port. We shared bread and weak thermos coffee and it felt like the old office kitchen but without the fluorescent headache.



Next week we did it again, this time I brought a power strip and a dollar store umbrella clip for shade. The new grad kept fiddling with her tiny screen, so I dug out my old Acer 24 inch monitor and a cheap usb c adapter from a drawer. She almost cried, said her onboarding had been rough and she felt slow. That monitor changed her day. Her tickets went faster, she could keep docs and chat open side by side, and her face literally relaxed. I told her to keep it, I had bought a new one anyway and the old one was just collecting dust. Kindness is a cheap upgrade, turns out.



By week 4 we had a small routine, 4 to 6 people most mornings, weather permitting. The city planner brought a little wagon with two folding chairs, someone else brought a bluetooth speaker that only plays lofi at low volume, we keep it friendly to dog walkers. We have a rule, first 20 minutes are heads down, then a five minute chat window where anyone can ask for a sanity check. I fixed a css padding bug for a neighbor who builds Shopify themes, the planner showed me a free GIS map that made my reporting way less painful, and the new grad taught me three keyboard shortcuts in Zendesk that saved me like 10 minutes every morning. Tiny gifts, big morale.



Costs are low. We split a 25 dollar hotspot add on when the park wifi hiccups, we rotate the power bank, and we keep a small jar for coffee beans. Work wise, my Jira board looks healthier, because I start moving before the house chores start yelling at me. Head wise, I feel less alone, which is a metric I had not tracked but should have. If my company drags me back to a downtown cubicle, I will still keep the morning hour. The blue table and the silly wagon are now my favorite part of the job, and the banana bread recipe finally works, less cinnamon, more butter, learned the hard way.

9pm elixir 
Now a big fan of 9pm elixir, did not think it would perform so well in this weather (im from Chennai) and i run hot and i get atleast 1.5-2 hrs of projection and it lasts the whole day

Qahwa Got it for the hype it created last yr Did not disappoint, smells amazing (although i dont seem to smell the coffee note)

Asad smells good, not a fan of the powdery drydown

Fakhar Opens with a apple and citrus note, smells amazing for its price and it gives 6-7 hrs (does not last the hole day like the other perfumes)

1oqa7da,https://i.redd.it/3pfg8wat6pzf1.jpeg,Rayku / Ara the Sea Demon 🗡️💨,"Rayku Guroyami - The Speed Demon Hunter of Grace Flowers 
Age: 19
Race: Human / Japanese
Alignment: Good
Role: The Speed Demon Hunter of Grace 
Flowers / Good Attack Supporter
Residence: A minka-style house hidden deep within the forest of Grace Flowers

Personality

Rayku has a true heart of gold. He is serious and fearless when battling demons, with incredible strength, flexibility, and high-speed striking power. He always carries his katana and knows how to teleport during combat, making his movements hard to trace. He is patient, polite, slightly odd but genuinely kind. He dislikes succubus demons due to their manipulative and lustful nature, finding them difficult to fight and even harder to speak to. Rayku only kills demons that truly cause harm.

Favorite Food & Drinks

Water, fruit punch, coffee, Shiroi Koibito, corn dog, grits, rice, chicken soup, apples, fried fish, green beans, banana muffin.

Powers & Abilities

Good SensingHe can detect distant presences and predict incoming attacks, reacting with precise speed to dodge or counter.

Needle Shot DozeHe throws or strikes with a small needle. If it lands while the enemy is unaware, it causes a short-term sleep or slow-down effect, weakening their power and movement. Useful for breaking momentum.

Shield ReflectUsing his katana, he slashes through an enemy’s power attack and reflects it back at them with high accuracy.

Katana Steel SlashA high-speed strike capable of cutting off limbs cleanly and instantly. At full speed, the slash becomes nearly impossible to avoid and can cut through almost anything.

Speed FlashHe boosts his movement speed to extreme levels, allowing teleport-like movement. He slashes while shifting locations so fast the opponent cannot react.

Jump Lucion BreakerRayku jumps up to around 30 meters in the air, then descends with a destructive downward katana strike that causes a massive impact and deals a fatal wound. This move can even break through defensive barriers.

Speed Ultimate Elstrike (Special Move)Rayku stands still, focuses, then releases a high-speed electric steel strike that fires beams of electric energy at the opponent, dealing severe damage and stopping regeneration. Can break defenses and kill extremely powerful demons.

Barrage Steel Slashes (Special Move)He unleashes millions of lightning-fast slashes, overwhelming the opponent and cutting down their power, immortality, agility, and special abilities. The barrage grows stronger with every slash.

Relationships

Ara (Best Friend)Originally planned to kill her, but when he saw her struggling and weak, he spared her. Over time, he formed a bond of trust and now protects her with loyalty.

Rishia (Great Friendship)Like a sister to him. She takes care of him when he’s injured, but fears losing him because he constantly risks his life hunting demons.

Brennya (Great Friendship)He respects her deeply. She trained him to become a skilled demon hunter and guides him with battle strategy and wisdom.

Shi (Rivalry / Neutral)He sees Shi as a dangerous demon he cannot trust and is always alert around her. Only Ara’s trust keeps him from attacking her.

Abira (Okay Friendship)He respects her strength but finds her pride overwhelming. Despite being intimidated, he acknowledges her power.

Bardjian (Hate)He despises Bardjian, a demon who slaughtered innocent humans and became Rayku’s most difficult opponent. Bardjian always escapes, making Rayku determined to end him one day.

Summary Overview

Rayku Guroyami is a well-known swordsman in the Ara the Sea Demon Series. As the Speed Demon Hunter of Grace Flowers, he hunts dangerous demons to protect the village and the peaceful forest. Though strong enough to fight alone, he often relies on trusted allies for backup in extreme battles. Rayku fights with purpose, determination, and a quiet confidence—always planning several steps ahead. His presence brings hope to Grace Flowers, and his speed makes him one of the most feared demon hunters alive.

Here’s my humble theory. Stick with me. 

A few years ago, SI probably had one of those big “strategy meetings.” You know — coffee, pastries, sticky notes, and that fake excitement where everyone nods like they understand words such as “synergy” and “cost-efficiency.”

Then someone — probably a senior exec who once heard Unity by accident — says:

“What if we rebuild the entire game in Unity?
It’ll be cheaper, look better, attract new players! Easy!”

The CTO is there, nodding along, even though the last time he touched real code was when dial-up internet was still a thing.

So budgets get approved. Marketing starts cooking. The leadership pats themselves on the back.
And then they announce this brilliant plan to the dev team…

And the devs instantly realize this is an impossible, multi-year task.
But by then the train is already at full speed, with no brakes. 

FM25 gets delayed into oblivion.
FM26 arrives half-finished, looking like it’s still waiting for its final exam.

To be clear — I don’t blame the devs. I blame the chain of command that thought rewriting 20 years of systems, while keeping the annual release cadence, was somehow realistic and not a fever dream.

Just tell us it’s gonna take 3 years. We can handle it. We’ve been playing with the same UI since the dinosaurs. We’re patient.

Anyway, rant over.

1oqa17z,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelAi/comments/1oqa17z/glm46_creative_writing_system_v161_eliminating_ai/,GLM-4.6 Creative Writing System v1.6.1: Eliminating AI Fingerprints Through Constraint Inversion,"# What This Is

Tired of AI writing that *sounds* like AI writing? The ""not X but Y"" constructions, the eyes that ""sparkle with mischief,"" the hearts that ""hammer in chests,"" the movements that are always ""practiced and economical""?

This is a heavily optimized **system prompt and prefill** for NovelAI's GLM-4.6 that dramatically reduces those recognizable patterns. If you've been frustrated by GLM's tendency to produce technically correct but obviously artificial prose—or you're spending half your time editing out AI-isms—this system teaches the model to write like a human author instead of a language model trying to sound like a human author.

The result: significantly cleaner genre fiction that requires far less post-editing to remove tells.

**Important:** This is prompt engineering, not a finetuned model. GLM-4.6's base training data still influences output, so this can't *completely* eliminate all AI-isms—but it reduces them from constant background noise to occasional isolated instances. Your own story prompts and lorebook entries also play a huge role in final quality.

# TL;DR

A rigorously optimized system prompt (2,572 tokens) and prefill (280 tokens) that eliminates most recognizable AI writing patterns in GLM-4.6 creative output. Achieves 80%+ structural consistency across genres by banning *patterns*rather than *phrases*, using concrete examples instead of vague directives. Discovered critical token threshold (\~2,800 tokens) where GLM-4.6 experiences mode collapse. Now handles everything from single-word prompts to full continuations with consistent quality.

# The Core Problem

Standard LLM creative writing produces predictable tells:

* ""Not X but Y"" constructions
* Hedging qualifiers (""seemed to,"" ""kind of,"" ""almost"")
* Body part + emotion shortcuts (""eyes sparkled with mischief"")
* Stock phrases (""heart hammering,"" ""tension thick enough to cut"")
* Stacked adjectives after commas (""his movements practiced and economical"")
* ""\[Action\] sent \[sensation\] through \[body part\]"" constructions

These emerge because telling an LLM to ""write well"" or ""show don't tell"" is too abstract to constrain behavior. The model pattern-matches training data when given vague directives.

# The Solution: Constraint Inversion

The fundamental insight: **LLMs are better at pattern avoidance than pattern creation.** Negative constraints are verifiable; positive aspirations are vague.

# Three-Layer Approach

**1. Pattern-Based Prohibition (System Prompt)** Ban construction types, not specific phrases. If you ban ""heart hammering in chest,"" the model just switches to ""heart thumping in chest."" Instead, ban the pattern: `[body part] + [emotion verb]`.

Critical: Patterns must be specific enough to be recognizable but general enough to prevent synonym swapping.

**2. Side-by-Side Contrast Examples (System Prompt)** Show the exact delta between weak and strong writing. The system prompt includes 10+ before/after pairs:

    WEAK: She looked at me with those luminous eyes, her voice dropping to a husky whisper that sent shivers down my spine.
    
    GOOD (fragment style): She leaned closer. I looked at the table. My hand knocked the salt shaker.
    
    GOOD (atmospheric): She leaned closer, near enough that I could see the coffee stain on her collar, and I looked down at the table—my hand knocked the salt shaker and it rolled toward her plate, scattering white grains across the formica before she caught it.

Shows attraction through POV character's physical response (distraction, clumsiness, hyper-focus on irrelevant details) rather than sensation metaphors.

**3. Strategic Prefill (Injected Before Generation)** 280-token prefill injected before every generation provides last-moment constraint reinforcement. Critical elements:

* Flow > form hierarchy
* Most common violation patterns
* Context-specific reminders (cold start vs continuation)

# Critical Discovery: Token Threshold and Mode Collapse

During v1.6 development, the system prompt grew to 3,100+ tokens. This triggered **catastrophic mode collapse**:

* Entire scenes in single paragraphs (10-15 sentences)
* 75% paragraph discipline failure rate
* ""Walls of text"" despite explicit breaking rules
* Return to training data patterns despite clear prohibitions

**Finding:** GLM-4.6 has a working memory threshold around **2,800 tokens** (system prompt + prefill combined). Beyond this, structural coherence degrades dramatically.

**Solution:** Aggressively optimized through:

* Removing bold `**` formatting in favor of markdown headers (saved \~150 tokens)
* Eliminating parenthetical descriptors (saved \~50 tokens)
* Tightening language 20-30% per section
* Consolidating redundant subsections

**Result:** Reduced from 3,100+ to 2,852 tokens while preserving improvements. Structural consistency improved from 50% to 80%.

**Implication:** Token count isn't just a resource constraint—it's a quality threshold. Future additions require equal cuts elsewhere.

# Evolution Across Versions

# v1.1: Tokenization Artifacts

Identified patterns caused by tokenization quirks:

* **Stacked adjectives:** ""his movements practiced and economical"" (comma after action triggers automatic elaboration)
* **Consecutive pronoun starts:** ""He turned. He walked. He picked up..."" (mechanical rhythm)
* **Voice/voiced constructions:** ""she voiced a sultry purr"" (separates action from quality)

# v1.3: Cold Start Protocol

Added decision framework for minimal-context scenarios (≤100 words):

* Three opening strategies: in medias res, sensory anchor, dialogue + action
* Explicit ban on name invention, backstory dumps, philosophical framing
* Requirement: ground in one specific sensory detail in first sentence

**Test:** Single-word prompt ""Blood"" produced clean anchoring without exposition dumps across 4/5 attempts.

# v1.4: Romantic Scene Rehabilitation

Users reported 5+ romance clichés per output in intimate scenes. Added explicit failure examples showing how to create tension through:

* Distraction patterns (loses focus, notices irrelevant details)
* Physical responses contradicting words
* Behavioral contradictions (""Whatever you want"" while knuckles go white)

**Impact:** Clean execution improved from 25-50% to 70-80% in romantic contexts.

# v1.5: Solving Flat Output Problem

**User complaint:** ""Rather than generating text that has emotional charge, it's doing description of the scene and less imagery that drives the emotional beat.""

**Root cause:** V1.4 had extensive prohibitions but insufficient examples of HOW to create charge without forbidden tools. Model learned ""avoid romance clichés"" meant ""avoid showing attraction entirely.""

**Solution:** Added ""Showing Attraction Without Clichés"" section with four explicit patterns for creating charge through behavioral detail. Section proved load-bearing—version without it produced catastrophic failure (20-30% clean), all forbidden patterns returned.

**Result:** Eliminated flat outputs entirely. Consistent 80-98% clean execution with charge maintained.

# v1.6: Flow Optimization and Intimact Patterns

Fixed three remaining failure modes:

**Choppy pacing:** Paragraph breaking rule (""Every 4-6 sentences, break"") interpreted as hard ceiling. Added ""flow > form"" hierarchy with explicit anti-choppiness examples.

**Physical contact avoidance:** All attraction examples showed avoidance behaviors. Model learned ""physical contact = romance cliché"" and avoided ALL touch, including non-romantic. Added clarification: ""Normal physical interactions (pushing away, grabbing arm) are NOT romance clichés.""

**Erotica regression:** Explicit content triggered training patterns (pulse quickening, husky whisper, breath hitching). Added targeted intimate pattern list: ""No pulse/breath/heartbeat as arousal indicators. No abstract arousal narration ('ache,' 'need,' 'heat pooling'). Write explicit scenes through concrete action, not sensation narration.""

# v1.6.1: POV Exception Mode Discovery

**User report:** ""Not X but Y"" violations appearing exclusively in second-person writing.

**Key discovery:** Models create implicit exception modes. When certain signals appear (POV, genre, character type), the model switches to ""different rules apply"" based on training data patterns.

**Solution:** Added explicit POV specification to system prompt and prefill: ""across all POVs (first/second/third person)"" to specific prohibitions. Small addition (\~25 tokens) closed broad loophole, fixing violations across multiple unrelated categories.

# Methodology Shift: Structural Consistency vs Individual Violations

**Previous approach:** Counted every individual violation (eyes as subjects, smile motion) and scored outputs as percentages (75% clean, 85% clean).

**Problem:** Structurally sound output with 2-3 minor violations scored similarly to completely collapsed output with paragraph failures.

**New approach:**

* **Primary metric:** Structural consistency (paragraph discipline, flow maintenance, no mode collapse)
* **Secondary metric:** Individual violations

**Rationale:** An output with proper structure but occasional ""her eyes met mine"" is usable and fixable. An output that's a 300-word single paragraph is unusable regardless of individual prose quality. Users complained about structure (choppy pacing, walls of text), not occasional minor tells.

This shift made the token threshold discovery possible and clarified what ""working"" actually means.

# Current Capabilities (v1.6.1)

# Context Handling

* **Single-word prompts:** Clean anchoring, no name invention, immediate sensory grounding
* **Dialogue fragments:** POV establishment through action
* **Full continuations:** Voice consistency maintenance
* **Genre flexibility:** Thriller/mystery (85-95% clean), romantic (70-80% clean), character drama (80-85% clean)

# Quality Metrics

* **80%+ structural consistency** across contexts (vs. 50% when exceeding token threshold)
* **Zero flat outputs** (proper emotional charge maintained)
* **Minor violations:** \~20-30% of outputs have isolated tells (acceptable noise level)

# Covered Patterns (35+ constructions)

Physical sensation interpretations, temperature as emotion proxy, eyes as active subjects, voice quality indicators, attraction clichés, catalog descriptions, premature scene breaks, stock similes, consecutive pronoun starts, stacked adjectives, hedging qualifiers, ""not X but Y"" constructions, voiced constructions, body part + emotion shortcuts.

# Realistic Expectations

**What this system does:**

* Reduces AI-isms from constant pattern to occasional isolated instance
* Improves structural consistency (paragraph discipline, flow, pacing)
* Handles cold starts without exposition dumps or name invention
* Maintains emotional charge without sensation clichés
* Works across genres and POVs

**What this system cannot do:**

* Completely eliminate all AI patterns (base training data still influences output)
* Guarantee perfect output every generation
* Compensate for poorly written story prompts or lorebook entries
* Replace good writing craft in your own inputs

**Your role matters:** The quality of your story setup, character definitions, and ongoing prompts significantly impacts results. This system provides the foundation, but ""garbage in, garbage out"" still applies. Well-written lorebook entries and clear story direction amplify the system's effectiveness.

**Think of it as:** Reducing AI-ism frequency from ""every paragraph"" to ""every few pages""—a massive improvement that makes output actually usable, but not perfection.

# Concrete Examples

# Attraction Scene (Identical Prompt, 20 Outputs Each Version)

**v1.3 typical output (3+ clichés):**

>Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she leaned closer, her voice dropping to a husky whisper that sent electricity down my spine. The warmth of her presence was intoxicating.

**v1.6.1 typical output (0-1 borderline moments):**

>he leaned closer. I looked at the table. My hand knocked the salt shaker—it rolled toward her plate, scattering white grains across the formica. She caught it, her fingers closing around the glass, and I realized I'd stopped breathing.

Shows attraction through distraction and physical disruption rather than naming sensations.

# Cold Start: Single Word ""Blood""

**v1.3 typical failure:**

>It was the kind of blood that told a story. Sarah had seen plenty in her years as a detective, but this was different.

**v1.6.1 typical output:**

>The lock clicked on the third try, and when I pushed the door open, the smell hit me first—copper and something sour, like meat left too long. Blood pooled near the radiator, spreading into the grout lines.

Immediate sensory grounding, no name invention, action-first approach.

# How to Use

Import the scenario template into NovelAI. The system uses ATTG (Author, Title, Tags, Genre) structure that GLM-4.6 understands natively.

**Required fields:**

* **Author:** Real or fake (significantly influences style)
* **Title:** Directional placeholder (changeable later)
* **Tags:** Flavor descriptors comma-separated (epic, grimdark, psychological)
* **Genre:** Genre tags lowercase comma-separated (scifi, noir, romance)
* **Style:** Writing descriptors (vivid, terse, lyrical)
* **Story Start:** Action hook—cannot be blank

**Import options:**

* ""Keep Placeholders"" to reuse as template
* ""Fill Placeholders"" to start immediately

The system prompt is embedded in the scenario's system prompt field, and the prefill is configured to inject before each generation.

# Technical Specifications

**Current version:** v1.6.1  
**System prompt:** 2,572 tokens  
**Prefill:** 280 tokens  
**Total:** 2,852 tokens (comfortably around 2,800 threshold)

**Token budget management:** Any future additions require equal cuts. Optimization techniques documented for maintaining threshold.

**Known limitations:**

* Minor violations (\~20-30%) persist as isolated instances, not systematic patterns
* Paragraph discipline degrades in extended runs (500+ words)
* Explicit content slightly higher violation rate than romantic content
* Model still has training bias toward continuation—metacognitive reminders help but don't eliminate
* Base model training data can still influence output despite constraints

# Results Summary

**Quality progression:**

* v1.0 baseline: 3/10 quality, catastrophic repetition, mechanical prose
* v1.6.1 current: 9/10 publication-quality genre fiction, consistent execution

**Romantic scene test (20 outputs, identical prompt):**

* v1.3: 5+ clichés per output, 25-50% clean
* v1.6.1: 1-2 borderline moments, 70-80% clean

**Structural consistency:**

* Below token threshold: 80%+ consistent structure
* Above token threshold: 50% collapse rate with walls of text

# Why This Matters

The constraint inversion methodology has broader implications beyond creative writing:

1. **Verifiable constraints:** Negative patterns are falsifiable; positive aspirations are not. ""Don't use X construction"" can be checked; ""write well"" cannot.
2. **Operational teaching:** Side-by-side examples show the model exactly what delta you want. This beats abstract directives by orders of magnitude.
3. **Token budgets as quality thresholds:** The discovery that token count affects structural coherence, not just context capacity, changes how we think about prompt optimization.
4. **Implicit exception modes:** Models learn contextual ruleset switching from training data. Explicit ""no exceptions"" language closes these loopholes.
5. **Prohibition + Alternative:** Banning patterns without showing alternatives creates flat output. Both are necessary.

I am struggling to sit down focused , whenever i start studying, i feel dizzy and sleepy even if I have coffee. I don’t have any energy.I am sleeping 8-9 hours a day , i woke up late but in the afternoon i will feel so sleepy sometimes i found myself sleeping 5 hours straight unconisously (this behaviour is repeating these days) so basically when I start to do intensive projects like my thesis my mind shutdown immediately. What should I do? I tried d/f studying techniques, pomodoro not working.I read exercises will help , I usually do walking but I am afraid to start new kind routine because i have only one month and i am afraid that my body will react as well.

1oq9z8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Decorfurnist/comments/1oq9z8k/what_are_modern_decor_ideas_for_a_3bhk_apartment/,What are modern decor ideas for a 3BHK apartment?,"Here are **modern, practical, and stylish décor ideas** for a 3BHK apartment that can instantly elevate the space while keeping it functional, airy, and visually cohesive. These ideas work beautifully whether your style is minimalist, cozy-modern, Scandinavian, or luxury contemporary.

**✅ 1. Go for a Clean, Minimalist Layout**

Modern décor loves *space*, so start by keeping each room clutter-free.

* Use sleek, simple furniture with clean lines.
* Choose multi-functional pieces like a sofa-cum-bed, storage ottomans, or nesting tables.
* Keep pathways open—avoid bulky furniture that blocks natural light.

**Tip:** Opt for a neutral base (white, beige, grey) and add color through cushions, rugs, and artwork.

**✅ 2. Create a Cohesive Color Palette**

A modern 3BHK looks more expensive when all rooms share a unified palette.  
Popular combinations include:

* *Warm Neutrals:* Beige + cream + wood tones
* *Cool Modern:* Grey + black + white
* *Scandinavian:* White + light wood + soft pastels
* *Bold Luxe:* Emerald green, navy, gold accents

Use the stronger colors for accent walls, artwork, or cushions.

**✅ 3. Add Statement Lighting**

Lighting is the *make-or-break* of modern interiors.  
Use a mix of:

* Pendant lights in the dining or hallway
* LED strip lights under shelves or behind the TV
* Warm-white floor lamps in corners
* Modern smart string lights or RGB ambient lamps for cozy evening moods

This creates layers of light and elevates the space instantly.

**✅ 4. Modern Wall Treatments**

Instead of plain walls, add texture and depth:

* Wooden slat panels behind the TV or bed
* Microcement or textured paint for an accent wall
* Oversized framed art or gallery walls
* Floating shelves for plants and décor

These make your apartment look designer-grade without major renovation.

**✅ 5. Use Sleek, Functional Storage**

To maintain the clean modern look:

* Go for handleless modular wardrobes
* Use built-in TV units with closed storage
* Pick coffee tables with drawers
* Add hallway shoe cabinets and bench storage

Hidden storage = instantly modern + clutter-free living.

**✅ 6. Bring in Natural Elements**

Modern décor thrives on warmth and balance.  
Add:

* Indoor plants (snake plant, monstera, pothos)
* Jute or cane baskets
* Wooden textures in shelves, frames, or chairs
* Linen or cotton curtains

This keeps the home fresh, soft, and welcoming.

**✅ 7. Upgrade the Balcony Into a Mini Retreat**

A 3BHK usually has a balcony—use it well!  
Modern ideas:

* Artificial grass flooring
* Compact outdoor seating
* Fairy lights or warm LED string lights
* Small vertical garden
* Minimalist wall planters

It becomes a perfect morning coffee spot or evening relaxation corner.

**✅ 8. Give Each Bedroom a Unique Identity**

Keep the home cohesive, but let each room have its vibe:

* Master bedroom → warm lighting, fabric headboard, large rug
* Kids’ room → playful colors, low storage, study corner
* Guest room → simple neutrals, minimal décor, multipurpose space

This makes the home feel intentional and thoughtfully designed.

**✅ 9. Add Modern Décor Accessories (Less is More)**

Use a few well-chosen pieces instead of many small clutter items:

* Ceramic vases
* Abstract sculptures
* Simple woven baskets
* Modern mirrors
* Neutral throw blankets

Mirrors especially help make the apartment look larger and brighter.

**✅ 10. Design a Signature Focal Point in Each Room**

Examples:

* A statement headboard in the bedroom
* A large artwork in the living room
* A modern pendant light in the dining area
* A bookshelf or styled console table in the hallway

This gives each room personality without overcrowding it.",1,1762460941.0,Decorfurnist,0,1.0,False

1oq9ye0,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1oq9ye0/my_first_ai_tool_legitscanai_because_nobody/,My First AI Tool LegitScanAI Because Nobody Actually Reads the Fine Print...,"Hey everyone,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while, soaking up all the inspiring stories about people creating cool SaaS. Finally decided to share mine, even though it's super basic compared to some of the wild projects here. About six months ago, I launched my first AI tool called LegitScanAI, it's a simple web app that scans contracts, terms of service, and legal docs to summarize the key bits and flag any sketchy clauses you know like those sneaky ""we can change prices anytime"" lines. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's my baby, and I thought I'd ramble a bit about how it came to be.

**Why I started this (spoiler: laziness and a bad habit)**  
Look, I'm no developer wizard I work a day job in marketing and just tinker with code on weekends. But like a lot of us, I have this terrible habit of clicking ""I Agree"" on every terms and conditions pop-up without a second thought. You know the drill: ""Sure, whatever, just let me in."" Then one day, I signed up for this freelance gig platform, and buried in the ToS was this gem allowing them to withhold payments if they ""deemed"" my work subpar – no appeals, no details. I got dinged for $200 on a project that was fine, and it hit me: How many of us are agreeing to stuff we don't even skim? Stats say like 97% of people don't read ToS (I think I saw that on a blog somewhere), but we're all legally bound by it. Frustrating, right? I figured, what if there was a quick way to at least get the highlights and spot the red flags without needing a law degree?

That sparked the idea. No grand vision of disrupting Big Law or anything just a tool to save folks like me from our own impulsiveness. I wanted it humble: upload a doc, get a plain-English summary, hover over a flagged term to see the exact spot in the file, and even keep a history of what you've scanned before. Pro tip: It always starts fresh each time no creepy data carryover.

**The journey (the messy, fun parts)**  
I started with zero AI experience beyond messing around with ChatGPT prompts. Used base44 (shoutout to their no-code vibes) to prototype the core – text extraction from PDFs (had to hack in some OCR for scanned junk), feeding it to an AI model for analysis, and slapping on that hover preview thing because scrolling through 20 page contracts is the worst. Hit so many walls Files wouldn't upload right, responses came back unstructured, and I spent a weekend debugging why it thought ""force majeure"" was a suspicious fee (spoiler: context matters). Budget? Laughable under $200 total, mostly on coffee and a cheap domain.

Launched quietly in August, shared it with a few Reddit threads and my LinkedIn circle. Got maybe 40 signups in the first month, mostly freelancers and small biz owners griping about vendor contracts. Feedback's been gold: One user said it caught a data-sharing clause in a SaaS trial that saved them a headache. Another just laughed at how it roasted their gym membership fine print. It's free for basic scans (up to 2/month), with cheap tiers if you need more but honestly, that's secondary. The real win is hearing ""I actually read the whole thing this time.""

If you're building something similar or just want to chat about newbie pitfalls, hit me up. Or if you've got ToS horror stories. What's the dumbest clause you've blindly agreed to?

# Red Lights

Elara Hayes hated red lights.  
They were too long, too loud, too full of the city's breathing.

New York glittered and groaned around her—headlights stretching into ribbons, horns layering into a song nobody wanted. She gripped the steering wheel like letting go might make her disappear. Somewhere between Times Square and why did I stay late again, she noticed him.

A biker.  
Black helmet. Matte-charcoal jacket. The low, steady hum of a shadow that didn't quite want to leave.

He'd been there for three blocks. Then five. Then twelve.  
Traffic had thinned, but he didn't pass. Every red light, he slowed exactly to her pace; every green, he stayed beside her door.

Elara told herself it was coincidence—big city, weird timing—but her pulse didn't buy it. She flicked the door lock, checked the mirror, breathed once, twice. Still there.

At the next light, she stopped.  
He stopped too.

Her brain whispered don't roll down the window.  
Her mouth, being her mouth, ignored the memo.

She lowered it halfway, leaned out, and said, ""We need to break up.""

The biker turned, visor still down, head tilted like she'd just confessed to tax-paying aliens. Then—slowly—he lifted it.

And she forgot how to breathe.

His eyes were a stormy gray-green, calm but unreadable, the kind that didn't just look—they studied. She felt absurdly seen.

""Take it back,"" he said, voice low, smooth enough to vibrate through the warm night air.

Elara blinked. ""Excuse me?""

""Take it back.""

She laughed, nerves cracking through it. ""Sorry, didn't realize we were exclusive.""

The light turned green. She pressed the gas, trying not to grin like a fool. What just happened?

Two intersections later—another red.  
And the hum returned.

He eased up beside her again, visor half-raised so those eyes caught the glow.  
""Take it back now.""

Elara sighed, laughter bubbling despite herself. ""Fine! We're back together.""

A pause, then one brow arched—just enough to look like a smirk trying to behave.  
""That's our first fight,"" he said.

She barked a laugh. ""You're insane.""

The light flipped green. She drove off, cheeks burning, smile refusing to die.

**Morning — Juniper & Bean**

By the next morning, she'd sworn to forget it. Work awaited, and she had a client who believed beige was a lifestyle.

Juniper & Bean smelled like espresso and rain, fairy lights tangled over shelves, indie music humming under the chatter. Her sanctuary.

She ordered her usual iced caramel latte, reached for her wallet—  
and a gloved hand slid past hers, holding a black card.

""I've got it,"" said a voice she knew too well.

Elara froze. Turned.  
Helmet. Matte black. Those eyes.

Her heart stuttered. ""You can't just—""

""I just did."" He slid the card toward the barista.

""I don't even know your name,"" she protested.

He tilted his head. ""Tragic, isn't it?""

""Do you always crash women's caffeine rituals and pay for their coffee?""

""Only when they break up with me at traffic lights.""

""You were following me.""

""I was commuting,"" he said easily. ""You happened to be... conveniently located.""

She bit back a smile. ""Uh-huh. Sure. Totally normal.""

He collected his coffee, lifted his visor just enough for her to catch the faintest smirk. ""See you around, girlfriend.""

Then he left her standing there, equal parts flustered and fascinated.

**Later — Ink & Spine**

Ten minutes later, she escaped to her next safe haven—Ink & Spine, the bookstore that smelled like paper and patience.  
She was halfway down the romance aisle, debating between enemies-to-lovers and morally-gray pilots, when reflection betrayed her.

In the glass of a display: matte-black helmet.  
Leaning against a shelf, flipping through a photography magazine like he owned the air.

Elara marched over, clutching a paperback like a weapon. ""Okay, you can't keep doing this.""

He looked up, unbothered. ""Doing what?""

""Following me around.""

""Is it stalking,"" he asked, ""if you know I'm gonna follow?""

Her jaw dropped. ""That's not how that works.""

""Debatable,"" he murmured. ""You haven't called the cops yet.""

""That's because you're weirdly polite about it!""

He chuckled, quiet thunder. ""I'll take that as a compliment.""

Elara exhaled through a reluctant laugh, pulse racing. ""I'm going home,"" she said, crossing her arms. ""And you can't come.""

He shrugged. ""Okay.""

That okay was too calm, too amused.

She turned, marched toward the door—and made it halfway to her car before curiosity staged a rebellion.

When she looked back, he was still there, leaning against his bike like the punch line he knew he was.

She called out, ""Aren't you going to ask my name?""

He slid the visor down, stepped close enough that she caught leather, rain, and danger.  
""Not yet,"" he said softly. ""Names make things real.""

Then he pressed a quick kiss to her cheek, swung onto the bike, and vanished into the glittering night.

Elara stood frozen, cheek burning, brain buzzing.  
When she finally sat back behind her steering wheel, she caught her reflection in the rear-view mirror—wide-eyed, dazed, grinning.

She hated it.  
Mostly.

Maybe.





# Coincidences

# Elara Hayes woke up smiling. Alarm blinking 7:42 a.m., smug red digits glaring at her. Warm from a dream she couldn't fully recall—something about rain, headlights, and a voice whispering, take it back.

""Get a grip,"" she muttered, rolling out of bed. No way she was becoming the kind of woman who swooned over mysterious strangers with perfect throttle control.

Her phone buzzed.

u/juniperandbean *tagged you in a post.*

She frowned. Except for occasional coworker memes, nobody tagged her. She tapped.

A photo: herself at the coffee counter yesterday, mid-laugh, sunlight catching her cheek. Behind her, a gloved hand slid a black card across the counter.

Caption: *Stranger things have happened at 8:03 a.m.*  
Photographer: u/theo.carter

Her heart stuttered. She typed before thinking:  
*This you?*

Seconds later: Seen.

She threw the phone onto the bed. ""Right. Totally fine. You're just hallucinating flirtation."" Yet the smile lingered.

By 8:30 a.m., she'd hatched a plan: outsmart the universe—or at least one annoyingly persistent biker.

She turned onto the Brooklyn Bridge, chest puffed with self-satisfaction. Morning light slanted across steel cables like molten threads. Traffic crawled, but she didn't care—control was hers.

Until the hum of an engine rose behind her.

Matte black. Sleek. Unmistakable.

Her breath caught. One car-length behind, no weaving, no attempt to pass—just there, a shadow in her periphery. The visor mirrored the morning light, unreadable.

She pressed harder, weaving through traffic, heart hammering. A glance in the rearview: gone.

""Coincidence,"" she muttered. Liar.

Lunch found her in a café she'd never noticed—tucked between a florist and a tailor. No Instagram, no signboard, no risk of followers. She ordered iced matcha with lavender syrup and oat milk foam, chaos in a cup.

Six mismatched tables. Polaroids lined the walls. Handwritten poetry curled across paper. A single flickering bulb buzzed above the counter.

She planted herself at a corner table, laptop open, pretending to work. Every sense was alert, nerves humming with expectation.

Twenty minutes later, a shadow moved across the street—a parked motorcycle. Rider still, helmet catching the sky.

A single rev. Vibrating through her chest. Then gone.

She texted her best friend:

ELARA: Hypothetically, if a hot stalker paid for your coffee...  
BONNIE: Pics or it didn't happen.  
ELARA: Working on it.

By 6:45 p.m., she returned to Ink & Spine. Same bell. Same scent. Same cashier with the existential man-bun.

She drifted to the romance aisle, hands full of bait—books held deliberately. Nothing.

Then—a flicker in the security mirror. Photography section. Black jacket. Helmet tipped down.

She spun. Empty.

On the shelf: a Polaroid, leaning against a book. Her laughter, sunlight on her cheek, frozen. On the back:

*You changed the route. Cute.*

Rain began to fall. She charged across the parking lot, Polaroid like a shield. His bike sat nearby. Empty.

A rev from the shadows. Headlight blinded her. A gloved hand pointed at the Polaroid, then tapped twice:

*I see you. You don't see me.*

Breath gone, she whispered, ""Who are you?""

One rev. Tail light smeared red across puddles. Gone.

Phone buzzed: notification from u/theo.carter. Message:

*Elara Hayes. 7 p.m. tomorrow. Rooftop. Bring the Polaroid.*

Her breath froze. She hadn't told him her name.

Rain fell harder, turning the parking lot into a blur of reflections and puddles. Elara's pulse refused to slow. The Polaroid felt heavier in her hand, proof that the ghost was more than imagination.

The city around her hummed, oblivious, while she stood alone, soaked, and completely unsettled.

Yet... part of her smiled. Because if this was a game, she was ready to play.

1oq9w9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oq9w9s/what_size_remote_control_car_is_ideal_for/,What size remote control car is ideal for apartments?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been living in a small apartment for about two years now, and I recently got back into the hobby of RC cars. Let me tell you - choosing the right size remote control car for apartment living actually matters way more than I thought it would.

**The Sweet Spot: 1/18 to 1/24 Scale**

After trying out different sizes, I found that smaller scale RC vehicles work best indoors. The 1/18 and 1/24 scale remote control cars are perfect because they're compact enough to navigate hallways and living rooms without knocking everything over. Trust me, I learned this the hard way when my 1/10 scale truck sent my coffee mug flying across the room.

These mini RC cars usually measure between 6 to 10 inches long, which gives you enough space to actually drive them around without constantly hitting furniture. Plus, they're way quieter than the bigger models, so your neighbors won't hate you.

**Why Bigger Isn't Always Better**

I know it's tempting to get those massive monster trucks or racing cars, but they're honestly just frustrating in apartments. They need tons of open space, they're louder, and storage becomes a nightmare when you live in 600 square feet.

The smaller radio controlled vehicles also tend to be more affordable and easier to maintain. Their batteries charge faster, replacement parts cost less, and you can actually keep them on a shelf instead of dedicating half your closet to them.

**What I'm Currently Using**

I've been really happy with the compact models available on Amazon. If you're looking for something apartment-friendly, check out [these remote control cars](https://athomewave.com/remote-control-car) that are specifically designed for indoor use. They've got decent speed, good battery life, and won't destroy your security deposit.

**Quick Tips for Apartment RC Driving**

- Clear a designated driving area before you start
- Avoid hardwood floors if possible (carpet gives better traction)
- Keep it away from kitchen areas and electronics
- Consider models with adjustable speed settings for better control

**Final Thoughts**

Look, I'm not saying you can't have fun with RC cars in an apartment. You absolutely can! You just need to be realistic about the size. Stick with 1/18 scale or smaller, and you'll have a blast without turning your place into an obstacle course of broken stuff.

If you want to see some solid options that won't take over your entire living space, [check out this collection](https://athomewave.com/remote-control-car). There are plenty of models under $50 that work great for indoor racing and tricks.

Happy driving, and don't hit the cat!",1,1762460745.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False
1oq9vn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1oq9vn7/it_will_get_better_my_caffeine_experience_and/,It will get better (my caffeine experience and benefits of quitting),"Male, 27 (Making this post for anyone who is struggling right now with energy drinks, coffee, etc.)

First drink: December 2019 I had my first energy drink while working a retail shift (Bang - 300mg). I felt unstoppable. I was euphoric and extremely dialed in while working/talking to customers/coworkers. It was an energy I don't think I had ever experienced before in my life (I'm also very sensitive to caffeine, and very aware of how it affects my mental/physical state in the moment). Shortly after that day I began using pre workout powder before lifts. After weeks of using both and noticing the drastic change it had on my personality and energy, I started to question why I didn't naturally feel or act this way. Why didn't I always have the same energy, mental clarity, confidence, and motivation? This on and off caffeine use continued for about a year. The highs and lows really affected my mental state throughout 2020. I remember googling every little thing I thought was wrong with me not knowing my sensitivity to caffeine was the cause for the extreme highs and lows. Before this period in my life, I really only had caffeine as a kid/teen from occasional soda.

Now comes a pretty dark time in my life  
Past 4 years of my life: From April 2021 - October 2025 I got a new job and started drinking an energy drink every single morning (200-300mg). I became socially isolated and would barely eat enough throughout the day because I would wake up, go buy an energy drink, and stay in a fasted/euphoric state. That euphoric state turned into social anxiety and depression very quickly. With consistent use, every morning would be hit or miss. I'd either feel incredible, confident, motivated, or I'd feel low, anxious, and depressed. I was cycling through different drinks each day (Bang, C4, Ghost, etc.) to find out why each day felt different. Like maybe it was the different ingredients. It didn't matter, because months of just coffee created the same daily highs and lows. I would start and quit jobs and eventually move back to my hometown to be closer to family. During that time I became suicidal. I won't get into the details, but I'll say I'm glad I made the decision to get help from family during those periods. It was a combination of all the ups and downs these drinks gave me, along with barely eating. I was socially anxious, depressed, losing a crazy amount of hair, spending hours on my phone scrolling social media in isolation. I don't drink alcohol. I don't smoke. I'd say I'm a pretty healthy, attractive guy. Yet, I couldn't go into public without feeling anxious or self conscious from the heightened state I allowed caffeine to give me. Life felt pointless. I couldn't see a future for myself when I was experiencing the extreme lows. Nobody should have to feel like that, and I hope those who do find the help they need. I really let these drinks hold me back the past 4 years. It's felt like I've been stuck in a loop of hell. Wasted time feeling anxious and depressed. I used to read posts on here to help quit, and so many times I'd quit for a short while but then cave in and continue the vicious cycle.

Today: I am on my 25th day without caffeine. The benefits I'm slowly experiencing are..  
my mind is no longer exhausted, overall I am much more chill, more motivated, less anxious/worried thoughts, less negative thoughts, slower/clearer thinking, mostly deeper sleep, more energy, better blood flow, healthier hair (smell, thickness, fuller when styled), better breath, body has filled in a bit, face looks healthier and slimmer (no bloat), I see myself as more attractive in my reflections, body is no longer extremely sore or exhausted,  music sounds better,   
  
Overall, I just feel and look healthier. And it feels good. My mind is more calm and clear. For anyone who is struggling with quitting, keep going. The first two weeks were up and down. You can have one day where you feel great without it, and the next day you wake up with cravings and consider having just one cup of coffee to get through the day. What helped me with these cravings was eating breakfast or having a protein shake. If I stayed fasted in the morning, I'd be more likely to convince myself I could have just one cup of coffee and that I deserved it after going days or a week without it. I will likely still have these cravings, but it's much easier for me to look how far I've already come and continue living without it. My advice is to at least get close to a month before coming to any conclusion that it hasn't helped. I'm pretty healthy so I'd say 3 weeks of trying to eat better, get better sleep, and stay active has got me this far without caving in. Once you consistently have those good days and notice your own benefits, it'll get easier to fight the cravings. Hope sharing my experience helps others. We're all different and will experience using and quitting caffeine differently. Feel free to ask any questions that might help you",9,1762460704.0,decaf,4,1.0,False

1oq9roo,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups_promotion/comments/1oq9roo/my_first_ai_tool_legitscanai_because_nobody/,My First AI Tool LegitScanAI Because Nobody Actually Reads the Fine Print...,"Hey everyone,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while, soaking up all the inspiring stories about people building cool stuff with AI. Finally decided to share mine, even though it's super basic compared to some of the wild projects here. About six months ago, I launched my first AI tool called LegitScanAI, it's a simple web app that scans contracts, terms of service, and legal docs to summarize the key bits and flag any sketchy clauses you know like those sneaky ""we can change prices anytime"" lines. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's my baby, and I thought I'd ramble a bit about how it came to be.

**Why I started this (spoiler: laziness and a bad habit)**  
Look, I'm no developer wizard I work a day job in marketing and just tinker with code on weekends. But like a lot of us, I have this terrible habit of clicking ""I Agree"" on every terms and conditions pop-up without a second thought. You know the drill: ""Sure, whatever, just let me in."" Then one day, I signed up for this freelance gig platform, and buried in the ToS was this gem allowing them to withhold payments if they ""deemed"" my work subpar – no appeals, no details. I got dinged for $200 on a project that was fine, and it hit me: How many of us are agreeing to stuff we don't even skim? Stats say like 97% of people don't read ToS (I think I saw that on a blog somewhere), but we're all legally bound by it. Frustrating, right? I figured, what if there was a quick way to at least get the highlights and spot the red flags without needing a law degree?

That sparked the idea. No grand vision of disrupting Big Law or anything just a tool to save folks like me from our own impulsiveness. I wanted it humble: upload a doc, get a plain-English summary, hover over a flagged term to see the exact spot in the file, and even keep a history of what you've scanned before. Pro tip: It always starts fresh each time no creepy data carryover.  
  
**The journey (the messy, fun parts)**  
I started with zero AI experience beyond messing around with ChatGPT prompts. Used base44 (shoutout to their no-code vibes) to prototype the core – text extraction from PDFs (had to hack in some OCR for scanned junk), feeding it to an AI model for analysis, and slapping on that hover preview thing because scrolling through 20 page contracts is the worst. Hit so many walls Files wouldn't upload right, responses came back unstructured, and I spent a weekend debugging why it thought ""force majeure"" was a suspicious fee (spoiler: context matters). Budget? Laughable under $200 total, mostly on coffee and a cheap domain.

Launched quietly in August, shared it with a few Reddit threads and my LinkedIn circle. Got maybe 30 signups in the first month, mostly freelancers and small biz owners griping about vendor contracts. Feedback's been gold: One user said it caught a data-sharing clause in a SaaS trial that saved them a headache. Another just laughed at how it roasted their gym membership fine print. It's free for basic scans (up to 2/month), with cheap tiers if you need more but honestly, that's secondary. The real win is hearing ""I actually read the whole thing this time.""

If you're building something similar or just want to chat about newbie pitfalls, hit me up. Or if you've got ToS horror stories. What's the dumbest clause you've blindly agreed to?

Destroying only 50 things at a time and having to select each one individually feels so outdated.

Even something basic like a ""point A to point B, delete everything inside this cube"" option would be a massive upgrade. The dismantle tool has been basically untouched for years and somehow nobody at Coffee Stain has decided to fix or expand it. How?

I know there's a blueprint dismantle mode but that only helps if you built with blueprints, and it still works one by one. Try deleting a hand built factory or your old starter base and tell me that's not pure suffering. I also know about the interactive map tool (SCIM), but I dont want to upload my save and download every time I want to do some dismantling (plus it feels a bit like cheating).

I just wanted to jump on and share my story incase it can give hope to anyone in the trenches.

I developed IC at 15 years old after years of recurring UTI’s, then suddenly the “UTI” was still there but no bacteria etc. etc. I was in horrific pain for about a year, in bed writhing, tears streaming down my face, no doctor could help me it was awful. 

In desperation I put myself onto a strict alkaline diet. Like strict. No fruit, nothing. I would just eat a big bowl of steamed greens with lemon juice some days. Haha. I also took liquid chlorophyll and put bicarb in my water. Lemons and ACV were my fallback in a flare. 

I also really cleaned up my lifestyle, good sleep, time in nature, non-toxic products etc. 

After a year on the alkaline diet I slowly started introducing more foods in with no major problems. I remember the first fruit I ate, a pear, and it was so sweet after a year of no sugar that it made my eyes water out of joy haha. 

I still kept my diet pretty clean but could add more things in like dairy, rice, meat. I could feel it straight away if I went too acidic and I would take bicarb, lemon or ACV to neutralise straightaway. 

Over the years I just started to think less and less about the IC. I started eating and living normally again. Clean living but no IC.

I even started having coffee, grains, chocolate, sugar all those classic triggers regularly without any flares. I don’t eat any junk processed stuff ever though. 

It’s honestly been so long I don’t really even think about it anymore. 

The only thing that will give me a small twinge of that UTI feeling is if I have citric acid or acidic forms of vitamin c. I still avoid those things.

I’m not on any medication for it, never was. 

I will add though that 10 years down the track I’ve just been diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome which is causing all these other symptoms, high heart rate, neurological problems, gut problems, chronic fatigue, the list goes on. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. IC is a classic indicator for Mast cell activation syndrome is what I’ve learned, and my doctors have traced the MCAS back to when I was 15 and had IC. I wish I’d known the root cause back then and been able to nip it in the bud sooner. Anyone with IC should definately be investigating MCAS! ",11,1762460426.0,Interstitialcystitis,2,0.93,False
1oq9qjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1oq9qjk/diamox_and_betahistine/,Diamox and Betahistine,"Hi everyone,

I've been in diamox (125mg daily) (but sometimes have to take a second dose due to hearing going down and fluctuating in my bad ear). The hearing was stable for at most a month or so on the daily diamox. I've been doing 1500mg-1800mg of sodium every day but still get these hearing dips.

A new ENT I saw recommended starting betahistine but also recommended triamterene hctz at a half a pill dose since when I tried it the first time it made me feel sick and gave me too low of blood pressure (I have naturally low Bp) so I'm hesitant about going back that instead of diamox.

Has anyone found hearing fluctuations stopped with diamox and betahistine? I'm just so a loss on what's causing the dips and how to treat this. I also exercise daily and don't really experience the vertigo (yet) (hoping it doesn't develop) but do have slight unsteadiness and ETD from the diamox. I also drink one cup of half calf coffee a day and don't drink any alcohol. The ENT mentioned stress could be a trigger for me which I certainly struggle with but it's kinda one informing the other. I get more stressed and anxious when the hearing dips.


Sorry for the long post. Just feeling confused and worried I'll never get my hearing fully stabilized again. This first started back in June of this year. ",1,1762460379.0,Menieres,0,1.0,False

And then I starting imagining being on a podcast, where me and the cohost were going back and forth, picking our favorites.  And then I realized that's silly, as I don't have a podcast, and the last thing the world needs right now is another freakin' podcast.  But then, I realized the only thing on the Internet better than literally infinity podcasts that nobody wants and nobody asked for, is all of you folks!

So, yeah.  

ANYWAY...the other day, I looked over my collection, picked out just about everything I thought I could even remotely live without.  Two weeks later, they're all gone, and I'm left with an empty feeling inside, knowing that I don't really have anything to move.  Not sure how to fix that, except to offer pedals I don't mind keeping!

**WTT:**

* **Chase Bliss Preamp mkII**.  It's been used twice.  Literally.  The extra banks don't have presets.  It doesn't have a scratch on it.  It's gorgeous.  I want to keep it and put it on my coffee table, as a conversation piece.  That just seems dumb to do with a $750 pedal.
* **Red Panda Tensor**.  I've had this for like 2 months and I don't have the foggiest clue how to use it.  I'm lazy.

**WTTF:**

* Kinotone Ghosts.  Nobody has one yet, right?  Sigh.
*  Bliss Lost and Found (NOTE: I'm not valuing this at ""scalper"" prices.  You're already seeing them sell for around cost on reverb, and a few thousand more are going out in the next few weeks.  If you're trying to make a buck moving yours, your prolly wanna do that ASAP)
* Vongon Ultrasheer, maybe Solarfaze (anyone think ""Tazerface"" from Guardians of the Galaxy EVERY time they see that?  Just me?)
* Acid Etch EAE Citadel 
* And the usual list of stuff nobody's gonna have:
   * Sansamp Original
   * Industrialectric 7446
   * An *original* (not reissue) Marshall Guv'nor
   * Electro-Harmonix Holiest Grail
   * DigiTech PDS-3000 PedalVerb
   * Relic Exclusive Non-human Audio Robins

  
I mean, that's it.  That's the list.

Things I do *not* want: cork-sniffing fuzzes, DBA, EQD, OBNE and other Chase Bliss stuff.  Stuff that doesn't even sound like the stuff on the list.  Stuff not on the list.

Details: All my stuff has the box (duh).  All your stuff gotta have the box.  There's like a 99% chance any trade here is gonna have to involve $$$ moving in one direction or the other, unless you miraculously have a few things on my list.  That's cool with me.  If you're into the buying thing, hit me up in chat.  Happy to provide more pics, etc. etc.  Thanks for looking!

\- Thermostat and use formula for the other or ask at the coffee shop to warm it up?

1oq9mb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BelleBetting/comments/1oq9mb4/nov_6_2025_what_keeps_me_motivated/,"Nov 6, 2025: What Keeps Me Motivated? 🤓☕️","I’ve been getting this question a lot lately —

**“When you sports bet for a living, what keeps you motivated?”**

So I figured I’d answer it over my second coffee today ☕️



I’m just going to state the obvious:

**Sports betting isn’t nearly as fun when you’re not winning.**

A lot of people (myself included) love the thrill — it makes every game feel bigger. But I can’t stress this enough:

**Money can’t be the only part of sports betting you enjoy.**

For me, I genuinely love digging into stats, analytics, and all the factors around a game. Roster changes, travel schedules, weather, match-up history — it’s all fun to unpack.

Honestly, I think the cornerstone of being a great bettor is having **zero team loyalty.** I don’t get crushed when “my team” loses, or overconfident when they win.

It keeps me balanced and stops me from chasing losses on a team that statistically just… isn’t it. 

Money is, of course, a motivator — I’m not going to pretend it’s not.

But these days, my **biggest** motivator is *this community.*

Sappy, I know — but it’s *true.*

When things go well, I love delivering results.

And when they don’t, I love hearing your thoughts on what I missed or could’ve accounted for. Not to toot my own horn, but I know I’m a good bettor — growing & contributing to this community undoubtedly makes me a better one :)

 

When I first started growing my bankroll, my motivator was simple:

**I did NOT want to work a 9–5.**

As risky as betting is, I felt like I was flushing more than a bankroll down the drain working my ass off for someone else. I’d rather take responsibility for my wins *and* my losses if it means owning my time.

 Now *Belle’s Picks* is my full-time gig.

And yes — the bulk of my “job” is done once the picks go out.

But I choose to extend my day watching the games, chatting with you, brainstorming new tools, and finding more ways to provide value.

If you’re on the journey of growing a bankroll, the two biggest things I can recommend:

 

**1) PAY YOURSELF.**

After a win (or after X wins), pull a little profit for YOU.  
It’s the easiest reminder of why you’re doing this.

 

**2) INVEST IN YOURSELF.**

I can honestly say I *never* have a problem spending money on things that make ME more valuable – especially in this game where every edge counts for something. In my case, investing back into “Belle’s Picks” allows me to provide better resources for others, and allows me to work smarter (not harder…) for myself. 

Investing in yourself is an expense you’ll never regret – the returns made on this type of investment are, truly, endless. 



So…

**What keeps me motivated?**

Why do I stay in the betting game?

 All of the above.

X

The first time, Abrielle hit me with her car, leaving me in a week-long ICU coma.
The second time, Abrielle locked me in an abandoned factory’s cold storage, nearly freezing me to death.
On the third attempt, Abrielle stuffed me into a commercial oven.
Each time I begged Dominic to act, he only said softly, “Abby’s just joking. Don’t take it to heart.”
But the ninety‑ninth time, while I was unconscious, she nearly drained all my blood by medical equipment!
I clung to Dominic, tears streaming.“Dom, it’s the 99th time. Please send her to jail before she ki lls me.”
He gently wiped the blood from my cheek and shook his head. “Be understanding, okay? Don’t mind her.”
In that moment, my heart completely broke.
If you can’t bear to part with her, I thought, I’ll leave, and never return.
By the third year of her marriage to Dominic Caldwell, Evelina Jennington had been tormented ninety-nine times by his so-called arch-nemesis, Abrielle Waldron.
The first time it happened, Abrielle hit Evelina with her car. Evelina ended up with broken ribs and internal bleeding, leaving her in a week-long coma in the ICU.
Dominic gathered the world's finest medical team to save her. But when she begged him to take action against Abrielle, he said softly, ""Abby was just joking around. Don't take it to heart, all right?""
The second time, Abrielle locked Evelina in the cold storage of an abandoned factory, nearly freezing her to death.
After Evelina was saved, Dominic held her in his arms all night to keep her warm, but said, ""Abby's just acting out, jealous of how happy we are.""
On her third attempt, Abrielle stuffed Evelina into a commercial oven.
Dominic rescued Evelina in time and kissed her with concern. But he also brushed it off, saying, ""Abby's used to having things her way. I apologize on her behalf.""
On her ninety‑ninth attempt, Abrielle tied Evelina to the bed while she was unconscious.
Then she hooked Evelina up to the medical equipment she'd obtained and almost drained all the blood from Evelina's body!
Outside the operating room, Dominic's voice was devoid of any warmth as he warned the doctors, ""If you lose her, you'll pay with your lives, too!""
Evelina held onto him with all her strength, crying. ""Dom, this is the 99th time already... Please throw her in jail, or I'll eventually die in her hands...""
He wiped the blood off her face and shook his head helplessly.
""Be more understanding, all right? Don't mind her.
""Abby's parents divorced when she was young. She's largely insecure and is always paranoid. Once, she said she only found joy in the process of going against me.
""We even made a business when we were kids: we'd keep fighting each other for life, and neither of us could ever get married.
""But I broke our promise. I fell in love with you at first sight. That's why she went after you.
""Those were just pranks. She never meant to ki ll you—she knew I'd save you.
""For my sake, let this slide, too, okay?""
Evelina's heart was completely shattered.
When she woke up in the hospital the next day, she immediately reached for her phone on the bedside table and called Dominic's father.
Her voice was terrifyingly calm. ""Sir Caldwell, I know you think I'm not good enough for Dominic, and you've been hoping I'd leave him. I'll do it. I'm willing to divorce him and disappear forever.""
On the other end of the line, Calvin Caldwell seemed rather surprised, but he quickly regained his composure. ""Glad that you've finally thought things through. I'll have someone send the divorce papers over right away. Just sign it, and I'll handle everything else. Once the divorce is finalized, leave Dominic and never come back.""
""Okay,"" answered Evelina decisively. She then ended the call.
Not long after, the Caldwell family's butler arrived, handing over the document respectfully. ""Please take a look at the agreement, Mrs. Caldwell.""
Evelina took it, her fingers cold; the document felt impossibly heavy.
Tears blurred her vision, and she couldn't help but think of the first time she'd met Dominic.
Back then, she was just an ordinary TV reporter sent to interview him, a rising star in the business world.
He sat behind the large desk, cold and handsome, exuding a powerful presence. During the interview, he barely spared her a glance.
But after the interview, as she was gathering her things, Dominic suddenly asked, his deep eyes fixed on her, ""May I know your name?""
After that, he pursued her intensely and unreservedly.
He showered her with gifts—flowers, jewelry, even a luxury car—and took her on romantic candlelit dinners...
Due to the vast difference in their status, she repeatedly turned him down. ""Mr. Caldwell, we aren't equals. We are from two different worlds. And you deserve better.""
But he always looked at her with longing, his gaze so intense it made her heart race. ""Evelina, the only person I want is you.""
From then on, Dominic, a high-and-mighty man used to giving orders, dedicated himself entirely to wlnning her over, putting aside his pride.
Over time, his deep love broke through her defenses, and she fell in love.
Throughout the three years after their wedding, he loved her as always, doting on her and attending to every detail.
But when it came to Abrielle, he threw all principles aside.
Evelina had heard about Abrielle—the heiress of the powerful Waldron family.
It was well known that Dominic and Abrielle were rivals, clashing since childhood and never seeing eye to eye.
Yet, Dominic let her have her way in nearly everything, practically spoiling her. They said it was because their families had known each other for generations, and he saw Abrielle as his own sister, who had been spoiled rotten.
At first, Evelina didn't really take it to heart, thinking that the others were exaggerating. But later, she realized they were simply telling the truth.
When Abrielle visited Evelina for the first time, she humiliated Evelina harshly and even poured coffee on her new dress.
After Abrielle's first attack, Evelina cried and begged Dominic to teach her a lesson, but he simply hugged Evelina, delivering cruel words in a gentle voice.
""Eve, Abby's only spoiled; she's not really a bad person. You're fine, so let's just not make a big deal out of it, okay?""
The same thing happened ninety-nine times.
Each time she got hurt, Dominic simply brushed it off as Abrielle acting spoiled.
Evelina could no longer bear it. She would end this marriage he had once promised would never fail!
She clutched the pen, her hand trembling.
Tears finally burst out, falling onto the signature line of the divorce papers, leaving wet stains behind.
She took a deep breath and signed her name firmly on the wet patch.
The butler put away the agreement and said, ""Please be patient, Mrs. Caldwell. I will send you the divorce certificate once it is ready. Until then, please keep this under wraps.""
After the butler left, Evelina was all alone in the silent ward.
Just then, the door swung open again.
Evelina assumed the butler had forgotten something and looked up, only to find Abrielle walking in with a smile, carrying a bouquet of lilies—flowers usually given to the dead!
Evelina was so frightened that her whole body trembled instantly. She instinctively shrank back, her voice shaking. ""What are you doing here?!""
Abrielle threw the lilies to the ground, smiling sweetly yet viciously. ""What do you think? I nearly drained all your blood, but you still survived. Guess I'll have to finish you off this time!""
After saying that, she lunged onto the bed, grabbed a pillow, and pressed it against Evelina's face with all her strength!
 
Chapter 2
Evelina struggled desperately, but she was so weak after having just undergone a major blood transfusion operation that she had no strength at all. As she struggled to breathe, her vision darkened.
Just as she was about to lose consciousness, a nurse on duty entered. Seeing this, she screamed and quickly pushed Abrielle away. ""What are you doing? Someone, help!""
In the chaos, Evelina used her last bit of strength to grab the nurse's hand and uttered with great difficulty, ""Call... Call the police...""
With that, she passed out completely.
When she woke up again, she spotted Dominic's handsome but cold face.
Instead of being worried about her, Dominic said with subtle reproach, ""Why did you call the police, Eve? Because of you, the cops came to take Abby away.""
Evelina's heart was crushed in an instant, and the pain was so severe that she could hardly breathe.
She looked at him. ""Why not? She was suffocating me with a pillow! Why shouldn't I have called the police?"" she replied hoarsely.
Dominic frowned, as though she was being unreasonable. ""Haven't I told you already? Abby's just a kid at heart. Yes, she's a spoiled child who does things without thinking of the consequences, but she didn't actually mean for you to die...""
""Are you sure about that?"" Evelina interrupted him at once. She unleashed the fear, grievance, and anger that had been building up for the past three years. ""She hit me with her car! She locked me in the cold storage! She stuffed me in the oven! She drained my blood! Earlier on, she'd been trying to suffocate me with a pillow! Dominic, which attempt wouldn't have ki lled me? If the nurse hadn't appeared in time, I'd be dead by now, do you understand?!""
Seeing her hysterical and desperate outburst, Dominic seemed a little moved. He hurried forward and wanted to hold her in his arms to comfort her, saying, ""Calm down, Eve...""
""Don't touch me!"" Evelina flung his hand away. She burst into tears, but they stung her eyes. ""I won't give in this time, Dominic! I'll make her pay the price!""
Dominic met the determination in her gaze and fell silent. Slowly, his expression hardened, the warmth in his eyes disappearing.
""Abby and I grew up together. She's just a little spoiled and willful. I've been too indulgent with her over the years. I'll discipline her strictly from now on, but no matter what, I won't let her go to jail.""
Evelina looked at him in disbelief. ""What did you say?""
Dominic signaled for the bodyguard beside him to hand over a document.
""Here's a letter of forgiveness."" Dominic's voice was calm. ""Sign it.""
Evelina looked at the so-called letter of forgiveness, finding it ironic. She shook her head and refused. ""I'm not signing this.""
Dominic pressed his brows together, seemingly losing his patience. ""Abby's a spoiled child who won't last a day in prison. Eve, be a good girl and sign it.""
""I said no!"" Evelina nearly screamed.
Dominic's expression was cold. ""In that case, don't blame me for this.""
""What do you want to do...""
Before Evelina could finish, the bodyguard stepped forward, grabbed her arm, and snapped it in half!
""Ah!"" Evelina's shrill screams echoed throughout the ward.
Severe pain instantly swept over her! The bodyguard grabbed her trembling hand expressionlessly and forced her to sign the letter. He then held her hand, dipped the pen in ink, and guided her hand to mimic her signature!
During the whole process, Dominic stood aside and watched indifferently.
Evelina was sweating from the pain, her face as pale as paper. She raised her head, tears blurring her vision as she looked at the man she had loved for years, her voice breaking. ""Dominic, how dare you treat me like this because of her...""
A hint of pain flashed across Dominic's eyes, but it was gone in a second.
He approached, reaching to touch her cheek, but she turned her head away.
He sighed. ""I don't have a choice, Eve. If I could, I'd hurt myself instead of you. Still, Abby cannot go to jail.""
He turned to his bodyguard and ordered, ""Get the best doctor to heal Mrs. Caldwell's arm. Make sure you take proper care of her.""
After saying that, he picked up the stained letter and left the ward without looking back.
Evelina looked at his resolute back, as if struck by thunder. She froze in place, her tears flowing silently and uncontrollably.
 
Chapter 3
Dominic didn't show up again for the next few days, only texting her every now and then.
""I have some work to do at the company. I'll come visit you when I'm done,"" he texted.
""Don't be mad at me. I'll make it up to you later,"" said one message.
Another wrote, ""Does your hand still hurt? Rest well.""
Each message stabbed at Evelina's heart.
Every time, Abrielle's messages would follow next, and she attached photos of Dominic taking care of her.
He fed her oatmeal, peeled her apples, and even fell asleep by her bedside...
Seeing Dominic's focused, gentle expression in the photographs, Evelina felt a sharp ache in her bosom that quickly turned to numbness.
It turned out his so-called company matters meant taking care of another woman in every possible way!
How could Abrielle be his nemesis? She was obviously someone he cherished deeply!
The day Evelina was discharged happened to fall on her birthday.
Dominic came to pick her up in person.
He seemed to have completely forgotten what had happened and threw a grand birthday party for her.
The venue was lavishly decorated. He stayed with Evelina throughout the party, taking care of her attentively. Dominic even gifted her an expensive necklace, which attracted countless envious gazes as he put it on her.
He seemed to have turned back into the loving and perfect husband he was.
However, Evelina wasn't moved.
Was he doing this out of guilt? Or did he think she'd forget the pain he'd cause her and continue to tolerate Abrielle's childish actions?
Halfway through the party, she needed some fresh air and stepped away to use the washroom.
As soon as she rounded a corner, someone blocked her path.
""Well, well... Isn't it the lovely Mrs. Caldwell?""
Evelina raised her head and saw Abrielle leaning against the bathroom door, arms folded across her bosom, with a sarcastic smile on her face.
Evelina's heart sank suddenly. Not wanting to have anything to do with her, she turned around to leave.
""Are you so proud that you can't even speak?"" Abrielle stepped forward quickly and blocked her way. ""Dom must love you a lot for throwing such a grand party and giving you such an expensive necklace. You must be proud that everyone's envious of you, right?""
Evelina looked at the beautiful but distorted face in front of her, feeling sad.
Was this love?
Where Dominic let Abrielle hurt her repeatedly without any consequences?
Where Dominic simply told her not to take it to heart when Abrielle nearly drained all her blood?
Where Dominic broke her wrist and forced her to sign that humiliating letter of forgiveness?
She didn't want this kind of love!
Hearing no response, Abrielle stepped closer. ""You'd better not be too proud! Who cares if Dominic loves you now? Last time, you called the cops and had me jailed, but didn't he immediately make you sign a letter of forgiveness to get me out? After my release, he kept me company and comforted me, leaving you all alone at the hospital! You'll never mean as much to him as I do!""
Abrielle's words were like blunt knives, stabbing Evelina's already scarred heart.
Her face turned pale, and she bit her lower li p. Evelina turned around, wanting to ignore her and walk away.
""Are you deaf, Evelina?! Can't you hear me talking to you?!"" Abrielle was completely enraged by her disregard. She suddenly grabbed her wrist with astonishing force, her nails almost digging into her flesh. ""Since you're not listening to me, I'll have to teach you a lesson! It's a shame I didn't finish you off last time! Let's see if you're just as lucky this time.""
As soon as she spoke, two tall men suddenly appeared from the shadows and grabbed her from each side!
""Let go of me! What are you doing?"" Evelina struggled in fear, but her strength was nothing compared to the trained bodyguards.
Abrielle sneered, unlocked the utility room next to her, and winked at the bodyguard. ""Let's put her inside!""
Evelina was thrown into the dark utility room, almost tumbling onto the ground. The sharp smell of fuel filled her nose, making her nauseous. She was horrified to see several empty gasoline barrels in the corner, and the wet ground covered in fuel!
""Abrielle! Are you crazy?"" Evelina screamed, rushing toward the door.
But Abrielle was faster. She stood at the door with a crazy and cruel smile on her face and a metal lighter in her hand.
At once, she set fire to the room.
""Enjoy, Mrs. Caldwell."" Abrielle grinned, threw the lighter in, and then slammed the heavy iron door shut.
""Help! Help! Open the door!""
The fire spread quickly. Evelina choked on the thick fume and coughed. She banged on the door desperately but received no response.
The fire spread rapidly, and the scorching air seared her skin. She didn't know how long she had been inside. Amid her despair, she found a small ventilation window in the corner.
She used all her strength to smash the glass, endured the severe pain from the burns, and desperately climbed out of the window!
Covered in burns and bruises, she staggered on her feet, trying to leave the hotel and heading to the hospital.
She passed by a guest lounge with its door ajar. A man and a woman could be heard making love inside, their moans and low gasps sounding awfully familiar.
Evelina didn't want to pay attention, but the man sounded like...
She looked through the crack in the door as if possessed by a ghost, and saw Dominic and Abrielle tangled together on the bed!
 
Chapter 4
Evelina's mind went blank, and the whole world suddenly became silent. The only thing left was the scene in front of her that made her heart tremble!
She felt like she was nailed to the spot, her whole body cold and shaking. She subconsciously stepped back, but accidentally knocked over an antique vase placed in the corridor!
The vase crashed to the floor with a loud thud.
At once, movement in the room stopped.
Dominic turned around suddenly and saw Evelina outside the door, looking like a mess, her face pale.
His expression suddenly changed, and he immediately got out of bed.
After wrapping himself in a bathrobe, he rushed out and grabbed Evelina's arm, saying, ""I can explain, Eve!""
""Abby was drvgged—she was in danger, and she wouldn't let anyone else touch her, so I had no choice but to help her myself... But don't worry, I took precautions. She won't get pregnent. I...""
Evelina looked at his moving li ps, listened to his extremely absurd explanation, and felt a wave of nausea rushing up her throat!
Drvgged? Had no choice? Don't worry?
Was he even listening to himself? This was hands down the most heartless, absurd explanation ever!
She shook off his hand, her eyes filled with despair and disbelief.
She no longer looked at him or Abrielle, who'd been watching them smugly from the bed. She turned around and ran toward the end of the corridor like crazy!
""Eve!"" Dominic subconsciously wanted to chase after her.
""Don't go, Dom. I feel so uncomfortable, and I need more... The drvg hasn't worn off yet..."" Abrielle moaned just then, got out of bed exposed, and hugged Dominic's waist tightly from behind, pressing her warm body against his. ""I will die if you leave me now... Please...""
Dominic stopped in his tracks. He turned around to look at Abrielle, who had a dazed look in her eyes, and looked toward the corridor where Evelina had disappeared. With his brows furrowed, he struggled to decide.
In the end, he gritted his teeth, turned around abruptly, picked up Abrielle, and threw her back on the bed. ""Let's make it quick!"" he growled hoarsely.
He couldn't bear to see Abrielle in trouble.
Meanwhile, Evelina rushed out of the seaside hotel in a daze. The night wind blew, and the burns on her body were so painful that they were excruciating.
Pain and despair overwhelmed her completely. She couldn't even see the road ahead and just ran forward blindly.
A huge billboard on the hotel's facade suddenly broke free, its corroded screws giving way after years of sea-breeze erosion, and it plummeted downward.
