1jwj4ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jwj4ms/meeting_people_in_real_life/,Meeting people in real life.,"I finally got to a point where I could order coffee and sit around people having conversations without panicking. I know I am regressing by not being social but I’m never in social situations since I work hybrid and even when we are in office no one talks to eachother. I want to meet new people and jointing a club is my end goal. But jumping from ordering coffee straight to a big social interaction like that is terrifying.

I’m currently in bed because playing a single level in a video game left me so tired I have to lie down. Earlier today I went out to buy some milk for my coffee and I had to take a four hour nap upon getting home (and I’m still tired). This kind of exhaustion comes in waves. Some days I have a reasonable amount of energy, some days I’m like this.

I live with my parents, who make endless demands of me even when I am this tired and I can’t say no without making the situation vastly worse. I told my doctor how tired I am. My doctor says it’s stress. My parents keep telling me I have nothing to be stressed about. They blame the psych meds that keep me from becoming suicidal and then they continue to aggravate my condition. I’ve been trying to leave for almost a decade now, but this economy laughs at my efforts. At this rate, I’m likely going to develop full blown chronic fatigue syndrome by the time I’ve moved out and then I’ll be too disabled to live independently.

1jwj1tx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SadCornerOfGamers/comments/1jwj1tx/im_skies_or_s_or_tricky_this_is_version_two_of/,"I'm Skies, or S, or Tricky. This is version two of random trivia facts about me. I ask you not to comment on any of my posts, yet people still do. I request chat requests and not comments, and every single time I say this, I get downvoted to zero.","I don't understand why people can't just send chat requests instead, like I ask. It's simple.

Other random facts about me.

What I eat as someone that is on the spectrum is this diet. Several people have asked me how far my sensory issues go as an autistic spectrum disorder person; here you go!

A few of my friends are asking about what I like to eat to get to know me. So, here are some random trivia facts about what Sky or Skies would buy at the grocery store. So, I guess enjoy this random trivia fact about me.

Chicken strips, frozen chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, and different types of rice in frozen steamer bags that all you do is put in the microwave, frozen dinners, and frozen pizza; from time to time, I also will already make a multi-blend of cheese on a premade crust you can already buy at the store. I will crave fish sandwiches and battered fish fillets from time to time. Different types of rolls and breads. Already made frozen patties. I cook dry pasta almost every single day, haha, and I'm very picky about sauces because of my sensory issues.

I've been on a huge protein waffle kick lately, which has also been added to the menu as well.

I'm not a huge pork person, and I just never have. Not because of a texture issue, but I just don't like pork flavor, and I also had lamb chops once, and I didn't enjoy that. The smell of deer stew makes me want to vomit, and here is a fun little trivia fact, haha. Speaking of stews, I know this is a sad shame for people to read this, but yes, I buy a variety of different flavors of soup cans, and I very rarely make my own.

Sorry, I don't like to cook, and I just have a little attention span to cook/don't have the motivation to cook most days. I know buying a variety of different canned soups instead of making homemade soup is a disgrace; I get that, and I know nothing can beat homemade soup. But when I have a very short, forgetful attention span and am depressed, well, good luck making homemade meals frequently.

I very rarely consume candy bars; I don't really care for them. I'm more of a pastry dessert person than candy, to be quite honest with my friends here.

Meat.

I like my meat with a little pink. It is fine; I will never touch rare or raw meat. Sushi is disgusting. I almost gagged and wanted to vomit trying sushi for the very first time.

Sandwiches:

You don't eat a lot of sandwiches? I wonder why.

That's because lunch meat is highly expensive these days for the amount of servings you get in a tub. Plus, I like two different types of meat on my sandwiches, with cheese and light mayo on my sandwiches. I also very rarely crave salads. I love salads with pasta, shredded carrots, and meat with just Caesar dressing or buttermilk dressing. I don't like Thousand Island dressing; that stuff is fucking vile. I've made an egg in the microwave before; yes, you put that in the microwave for 50 seconds and cover that with a napkin, and there you go, LMFAO, and I know that's ghetto, but whatever.

I only like organic hen eggs; I will not buy eggs unless I know the eggs are from a cage-free/roam-free environment for the hens.

I also have tried frozen cauliflower mashed potatoes and frozen cauliflower rice, and I want to try frozen carrots in sage butter. Sounds yum! Of course those are also frozen steamer bags I was talking about besides the frozen cauliflower mashed potatoes.

The pizzas I eat have cauliflower pizza crust with pepperoni or cheese. I think Pizza Hut is really disgusting and stale, but in real life I was forced to eat that even though I wanted something else. I could never enjoy Domino's or Papa John's because my family wouldn't let me because apparently Pizza Hut is superior. No, it's not. Pizza Hut's pasta is better than their actual pizza, which shouldn't be that way because Pizza Hut is a pizza company and not a pasta company.

Speaking of pizza, I don't like 80 percent of frozen pizzas because most frozen pizzas apparently need a whole entire jar of marinara sauce, which in the end makes me sick, and I feel ill afterward. Better Goods Pizza by Walmart and Good Gather pizzas are my favorites. As well as California Kitchen. Other brands are way too saucy or way too gross for me.

I do love nutritional protein shakes, which aren't bad. You just have to find one that doesn't taste so bad. I normally reach for the Atkins brand, normally protein milk with protein cereal and yogurt with a good amount of protein. For snacks, my snacks are just what normal people consume, like pretzels, meat sticks, chips, Goldfish, and things like that. I very rarely eat cookies as a snack; I would rather reach for a protein bar or something similar like that. But for me, that's normally pretzels, meat sticks, chips, crackers, and different spreads for the crackers. I'm a big fan of the garden melody, as I think it tastes quite great because the veggies are chopped up very small, and I find it very flavorful with crackers, which, speaking of crackers, I do have different types of crackers for snacks, and a recent protein favorite of mine in 2025 is gourmet nuts or going to Walmart in the Atkins aisle and picking me up some protein chips or other bagged protein items.

Drinks.

Zero-sugar juices, sparkling water, and, yes, I know, disgusting sparkling water. It's not that bad; you just have to spend a lot of time finding a flavor that tastes great, and that takes a lot of time and tons and heaps of sparkling water to find what flavor palette tastes good to you. I also drink Gold Peak diet brew tea. Iced coffee tastes better than hot coffee; that's my own personal opinion, and if you want to know what I like at Starbucks, we will be here all day. Maybe I will make trivia facts about what Sky, S, and Tricky like at Starbucks, and I also like a variety of tea bags.

I only consume sodas every two or three days. Just 1 can. I normally go for zero-cherry-flavored sodas, and if not, I go for the diet sodas, as I don't want 110-plus grams of sugar at night. My favorite sodas as of late are zero sugar cherry by Pepsi and Coke, and I think the zero sugar cherry by Dr.Pepper is okay and not the best, as Pepsi and Coke are in my personal flavor palette.

Favorite energy drinks are Bloom and Alani. Those are my go-to. I also like caffeinated sparkling water and zero-sugar energy drinks. The Celsius energy drink brand is okay; there are some favorites, but not a lot of them, haha.

Favorite bread and cheese?

I can't answer that; that is too many to list, haha.

Dislikes.

Due to my spectrum sensory issues, I do reject some foods because of textural issues, which has caused me not to eat certain products.

Berries are a no for me; I don't like how berries are gushy, and I don't like anything that gushes; that is a massive sensory issue for me.

Jams are better than jellies for me with sensory issues. I know this might seem surprising, but a lot of people on the spectrum can't stand yogurt; the key to this is to find a yogurt that doesn't taste like cottage cheese and is lumpy. Because that's when things are really nasty: I've bought yogurt that turned out to be cottage cheese texture and lumpy. I also do enjoy yogurt in a protein smoothie, but I don't buy them anymore unless they are on sale because in the past Kroger had 90-cent yogurt smoothies with 10 grams of protein, but now they are $1.50 A PIECE. Even though I'm on EBT, I'm not paying that kind of money for that for one serving; that's ridiculous. I would get a better deal purchasing Atkins, which Walmart sometimes has on rollback, plus the Atkins brand has more protein, which is 15 grams. I also will have the strawberry or vanilla Carnation Breakfast Essentials that you basically just open the packet and pour into a cup of milk. With that being said about the Kroger protein smoothies that I no longer buy because the price is outrageous, it's not really a loss for me because I get better servings and protein with those two brands I just mentioned anyways, so whatever… Speaking of protein, I've tried several protein bars, and I think almost all of them are flavored cardboard, and that's just so gross, haha. I'd rather have protein chips and protein snacks that you can find at Walmart that are with the Atkins protein drinks.

I do like the textures of mashed potatoes and gravy. I've tried mashed sweet potatoes before, and that was very tasty. But purees are very smooth textures and aren't gushy or jelly-based, which I simply don't like to eat. Cream cheese also has a smooth texture, and I love cream cheese, and I'm not bothered by that texture either. The texture of oatmeal is so-so for me; I'm not a huge fan, but it's definitely not the worst texture issue that I've ever had before. I've had worse, for example, berries that are gushy, and that means I can't eat gushy pies. I only like pies that have a silky texture, with no gush.

So, any fruit pies that have anything when you bite into them that gush when you take a bite are a big no thank you from me!

For other things for sensory issues, let's see what else I can list before going on to other items.

Peanut butter is okay, but it's something I don't reach for often.

The sensory texture issue could be worse; peanut butter that is super crunchy is no thanks. I hate crunchy items that are super crunchy because of textural issues, and having a very bad overbite makes it difficult to eat certain foods.

Honey is okay, buttercream frosting is okay, syrup is okay, bubblegum sticks are fine, snow cones are fine, and ice creams are fine as long as there are no big fruit chunks in the ice cream; then I'm cool with that. Marshmallows are alright. Other than that, yes, most foods don't cause me sensory issues, but as you can see, I can't enjoy a lot of normal desserts that people enjoy because of the gushing or jelly-like textures, unfortunately.

I don't like milkshakes if the fruit chunks are massive or if the chunks aren't small enough and you can taste the texture of the milkshakes. My chunks must be finely diced for me to enjoy a milkshake with fruit chunks inside the milkshake.

Saucy pizza, that is because this upsets my stomach, and I also have to be very careful with very spicy sauces. I will put this the nicest way possible, but to tell you the truth, spicy sauces have caused very unpleasant bowel movements sometimes and have woken me up to go to the bathroom. I also don't like sour cream at all or diced tomatoes because of the textures. I also had some canned chili from the store, and I got very sick from eating the canned chili; whatever spices were in there made me sick.

I HATE PICKLES; PICKLES RUIN A LOT OF THINGS AND REALLY, BURGERS. OH MY, PICKLES ON A BURGER IS LITERALLY DISGUSTING. I had people in real life tell me, I know, tell me, just take the pickles off; you won't taste anything! Uh, no, that's the biggest FAKE NEWS I've ever heard; you can literally taste the pickle juice saturating the hamburger bun. Talk about disgusting! Those people that used to know me in real life got so mad that I refused to eat the burger because the taste was so bad, haha. If the burger doesn't have meat, cheese, and sometimes I like onions depending on how the onions are prepared, that's all I like on my hamburgers, or I will not eat the hamburger. But onions don't cause sensory texture issues for me because onions aren't mushy, gushy, and jelly-like in texture. The only time I hated onions was a very poorly battered onion ring, and that did trigger a sensory texture issue because the onion ring was very slimy/raw. But I do enjoy finely small chunks of cooked onions on my hamburger with cheese, and that's all. I'm just an onion fiend kind of gal, haha.

Chobani yogurt is so disgusting. I've tried several products; this is basically a PTSD food for me. Literally, this stuff tastes extremely sour and so awful!

Whoever likes pineapple on a pizza is a walking red flag, just saying haha. 

My favorite gum flavor is sweet mint or wintergreen flavors! Which are very hard to find, and that's why it's in the dislike section!

I barely consume ramen noodles; my taste buds just don't really like ramen noodles much anymore. But if I had to pick, the creamy chicken was my favorite; it's a sad shame that the mushroom flavor isn't around anymore, and I wish that wasn't discontinued. I also enjoyed the roast chicken. The pork is the most disgusting ramen flavor I've ever had in my life.

It's the same for frozen burritos, tacos, and taquitos. My taste buds have changed as I've gotten older, and I rarely buy those because I rarely crave those kinds of food now. But I always get beef and cheese. Most cheese and bean burritos have 90 percent beans and only 10 percent cheese; it's why I dislike them. For tacos, I like beef and cheese or chicken and cheese. It's the same for pizza rolls; I don't even have that in the freezer right now, haha. I do like to get biscuit dough that is premade and put pepperoni slices and shredded cheese on it for ghetto pepperoni and cheese biscuits, but in ghetto style, though. I only go out to eat twice a week; I do limit my intake of fast food as well. 

2024 and still 2025, I have a massive hyper fixation about the way I eat; please don't ask me why, okay? I can't answer that, and my quirky, weird, autistic brain can't answer you either, haha.

It's like a person on the spectrum having a meltdown because the package of a doll or a figure from a blind box or bag has imperfections, and that induces someone on the spectrum to have a meltdown. Don't ask if it's a spectrum thing; a lot of people with autism are like this, from previous conversations I've had in the past.

My Spotify playlist:

Someone I know in my online circle helped me make a playlist while I was setting up a Spotify playlist, as I never had one before. As I always stuck with YouTube or Pandora for everything.

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RjjQ9cs4LJb7T9eCF4FCn?si=Ddea73A6QG6v7XdObUW2eQ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RjjQ9cs4LJb7T9eCF4FCn?si=Ddea73A6QG6v7XdObUW2eQ)

I know I'm going to get this comment a lot, so I'm going to address this now and finalize everything for closures. For readers that want to befriend me, have I gone to groups to meet people with autism spectrum disorder, PTSD, and other mental illnesses? 

Before you message me anything and send me a chat request saying, You can go sign up for group programs to meet people with the same mental health issues as you, so you don't need to be posting things like that on Reddit, okay? First and foremost, I already know this information; thank you very much. I don't need to be told this or treated this way as if I don't know anything. If you want to say, go on subreddits on the mental health issues that you've had and ask for friendships there. Okay, most subreddits don't allow self-promotion, which is self-promoting yourself or looking for friends or friends to talk about how dating to find relationships seems cursed. It isn't allowed, so yes, I've already looked, thanks.

There is nothing wrong with me looking for friends on Reddit either with the same mental illnesses as I do, okay? If you don't like my posts, okay? I'm sure you don't like other people's posts similar to mine, but other people have reached out to me with kindness, so it's honestly okay if you don't message me. I would rather be spared of your outlook on my posts, your attitude, and your energy being friends with you, so there is that in general.

Have you been to a behavioral and mental health center before?

Okay, it's a little bit rude that you would ask this, but yes, I have. I was misdiagnosed from 2008 all the way through high school with Rett's Syndrome and ADHD. I already explained this in my pinned post, so you can check that out yourself, but I was raised in a household and family with members that had never heard of the word autism spectrum disorder until the high school counselor consulted a family meeting with my parents to talk about how your daughter might have autism spectrum disorder and this is her problem. A few reasons why my family didn't seek further treatment.

One was my family spending out-of-pocket money on different types of ADHD medications and feeding me a strict sugar-free diet as a Hail Mary to subdue this mysterious behavior I was displaying; the doctors told my parents that this was the issue with my outbursts in school and in the house because I was being fed too much sugar and I had ADHD with Rett's Syndrome. My family has told me in their life that all this ADHD medication and sugar-free diet has almost made them in debt.

I also couldn't get on Medicaid because Medicaid basically told my parents, You have enough money to fund mental health doctor expenses, so your daughter doesn't qualify.

Which is a total lie; the Medicaid office blew off my parents and totally ignored that my parents lived paycheck to paycheck, but the Medicaid office didn't care. I think, still as a 32-year-old person, I think it's wild Medicaid denied me health insurance because apparently my parents living paycheck to paycheck makes them too rich and able to afford mental health care for me further in my years into a young adult. Okay, Medicaid office, if that's what you really think, that my parents were rich, you're wrong.

Glad you think living paycheck to paycheck back then is rich.

I couldn't get on Medicaid until I was 18 years old, and that's when I started going to mental and behavioral health insurance places that did take that insurance. Are you surprised? Yes, if you want to be on Medicaid, you can find mental and behavioral health insurance buildings that take Medicaid, yes.

I applied for SSI when I was in my late 20s, requiring recent mental health and behavioral health, and I stated as well that I can't handle physical pain because it's a severe sensory issue. I got diagnosed with the same mental health and behavioral health issues as I did in my 20s. What about your physical sensory health issues? Did SSI say anything towards that?

Yes, SSI thought that wasn't an issue, and my other mental health with my behavioral issues wasn't a good enough reason to be applying for SSI, and I got denied once by SSI, stating that I can work in society, but my work will be extremely limited for what I'm looking for, so I had to deny their claims and spent a year and a half or longer just for SSI to approve of me and an SSI check because I wasn't going to go down without a fight, that's for sure, and I needed some kind of income because one of my family members said in my late 20s' that I will be cut off soon from financial aid from them, so I need to find my own income; again, you can find this on other pinned posts on my profile.

Do you take pharmacist-prescribed medication then? You need to be on pharmacist medication and therapy, by the things I read on your profile and posts.

First and foremost, stop acting like you know what I seriously need. People like you are why I never will be posting on Reddit ever again or coming back on Reddit ever again, and I'm leaving Thursday. Please stop acting like you know me or any other Reddit users that are on here to tell them your couch doctor suggestions because you don't even have the right to say that to me or other Reddit users to begin with because you simply don't know them as a person, and what I have to say is below.

Since people are telling me how much I need therapy and therapy is recommended, you never bother to ask if I've been to therapy in the past or have gotten psychologist exams; you never once bothered to ask but basically went against my post rules and decided to post comments on my posts on different subreddits, which I ASKED FOR REDDIT USERS NOT TO DO!

Anyways, there are people out there that have PTSD trauma related to pharmacist medications. This develops as a kid, teenager, or early or late adult by being forced to take medication as a Hail Mary to subdue your child's problem, which sadly is what happened to many 2000s kids that were misdiagnosed and whose kids were actually displaying autistic spectrum disorder behavior and were fed ADHD medication to control this unusual behavior, which I was a victim of. There was no doctor that could figure out what was wrong with me and kept on labeling me with Rett's syndrome and ADHD until the high school counselor decided to ask my parents to go into a school meeting to tell them about how I could possibly be autistic. Anyways, I was forced on sugar-free diets and ADHD medication for quite a few years until I had to be taken off of ADHD medication because I lost the ability to tell if I was hungry anymore. I was really dazed, confused, lost, and zombie-like in school, and one ADHD medication gave me a scary side effect where I became very hostile in my behavior. Because there is one ADHD medication out there that isn't for people that have chronic depressive disorders, PTSD, and other mental health issues because there is a rare side effect that can cause aggressive behavior in others. That is what my parents did and decided that I can't be medicated. You might ask, Your parents should've put you on a lower dosage, and problem solved."" My parents did that, but that didn't work, and I still suffered from the same lost, dazed, confused zombie state and had no idea what lunch and dinner were because I wasn't really hungry. 

I also had an addiction in my early 20s to antidepressants, which made me spiral out of control. Just thinking about all the medications I was on, even for other people, is trauma-inducing. Please don't think you understand me or other Reddit users if you've never been through this yourself.

Strattera, a non-stimulant medication used to treat ADHD, can cause anger or aggression as a side effect, even in people without a history of mental health conditions. However, individuals with existing mental health conditions, such as depression or bipolar disorder, may be at a higher risk for these side effects.

You might ask, Did you get tested for bipolar in the past?

Yes, quite a few times, and I was told by a psychologist that I don't have bipolar because my mood normally is the same for hours on end, and I don't experience rapid mood changes or have a manic sexual drive. 

But if you take supplements, you should have a PTSD flashback if you're taking supplements that are in a bottle and the herbs are inside clear capsules.

Um, okay, why do you feel the Reddit readers think you need to debunk and claim you know everything about me and other Reddit users when you simply don't? Just stop doing that already, and really, when people ASK YOU NOT TO.

First and foremost, my supplements don't come from a pharmacist, nor do I have to go to a holistic treatment doctor to get them prescribed, so therefore they're not a memory trigger for my PTSD. I simply order my herbal supplements on Amazon Prime to save money instead of going to CVS or Walgreens; besides, you can't even get yarrow root, stinging nettle, and chamomile capsules at CVS or Walgreens either. You can get chamomile tea, yes, but I would rather take capsules because, as everyone knows, you will be visiting the bathroom when all you want to do is relax.

What about taking the supplements and putting them in your mouth? You've had some kind of PTSD flashback.

No, not really, because these clear, tasteless capsules will not remind me of any of the pharmacist's pills. 

Since there are a lot of people that think PTSD is all flashbacks and nightmares, I advise you to take your own free time for education and type out hyperarousal PTSD window of tolerance images to find a graphic chart.

Here is an example, and I hope this makes you open your eyes: you never had a right to vouch for people with PTSD, telling them to go seek treatment for flashbacks and nightmares from PTSD to reduce and get rid of the symptoms with a few years worth of treatment to cure the problem. As you can see, PTSD is a whole lot more than that. This chart is basically me in a nutshell. I no longer have nightmares. I had really bad nightmares in my late 20s about my high school trauma haunting me, but that went away. I now suffer from the hyperarousal symptoms followed by what causes my window of tolerance to go out of the window, and once in a while I can hit in the hypo range. But for most days I can stay in the middle of the chart. The thing with hyperarousal PTSD is you need to keep your stress meter very low and at the lowest minimum possible. The higher your stress rate is, the more you will hit what makes you go out of the window of tolerance with unconscious thoughts about what the chart in the green box says to the left.

If you're wondering what it's like to go to sleep with someone with hyperarousal symptoms, this works for me but may not work for you. You know those herbal supplement capsules that I say that I take every single day? I get very drowsy within 30-40 minutes of taking them, and if I need a booster, if I'm in a very hyper mindset, I take a herbal tea blend for sleep remedy as a booster, and that helps. I get about 7-8 hours of sleep. But remember, what works for me may not work for you, and if you're allergic to the Aster family of herbs, then yarrow root and chamomile won't work for you. Because you can be allergic to those two herbs if you have a known allergy to chamomile, if you had an allergic reaction to chamomile, that means you're allergic to the aster family of herbs. Some herbs also state on the bottle, and this is an example on my yarrow root capsule bottle.

Take one capsule three times daily. DON'T TAKE THREE CAPSULES TIMES DAILY, DON'T!

If one capsule doesn't work, then try two and then go from there! If I did take the suggested three times daily, I would be extremely faded!

One capsule is even enough to make me very drowsy without chamomile and the sleep tea booster. So, everything is just trial and error. The reason why I take a combo of yarrow root and chamomile is I want to make sure I STAY asleep for 7-8 hours to get a healthy amount of sleep.

I did have therapy in the past, but it's nobody's business about that at all. But yes, I went to therapy quite a few times in the past; it's none of your business why I don't want to keep going to therapy here and there. Besides, if I want to look for friends with similar mental health issues and seek friends to talk about the problems that I posted about, it isn't an issue. You people on Reddit, however, are making a huge scene on my posts and comments that I never asked for, and here I'm just making a post trying to find similar people just like me or who want to talk about similar things that I'm looking for.

I'm just going to say this now, because few to no people understand that there are PTSD-related trauma symptoms from medication; you wouldn't understand if you've never been through anything like this. This is why I say it's simply NOT okay for someone to be going around someone's Reddit posts on different subreddits, basically telling them what is suggested and playing couch doctor behind a digital screen.

Why do you say you're cursed?

I can't escape this.

I'm left with questions and thoughts that there is nothing really out there for me. Maybe, just maybe, I could be proven wrong.

Have you ever just sat in your room just thinking that relationships aren't for you and you're not meant to date anyone? Has anyone ever felt like that? I don't know why, but I always think this, and I'm destined somehow to feel this way. Sometimes I just feel like I'm just cursed with feeling this way. Does anyone feel similar to me while terrified of thinking that you will never find any relationships that will last? I suppose some of us are imprinted in life not to have relationships; instead, we can only have friends. I don't know anymore, but I do know that I've given up, unless I can be proven otherwise.

I also decided to end my relationships that I'm in because I'm simply just not good enough at all, but I feel, in all honesty, the only thing left I have a strong belief in is that the gods are going to put me on the right path and leave me breadcrumbs when this time is very dark.

I think the reason why it's so hard to talk about this is because I don't think there is a person out there that thinks like I do. Now, don't get me wrong; I'm not implying that I expect to have people in life that are the same version of myself. No, that's not what I'm implying. I'm trying to say that I don't think I'm understood. I'm the type of girl that you might call mission impossible to date. I say this because I can't handle, with my anxiety, my autism spectrum disorder, and PTSD, a guy that works 4 days out of a week with hours like 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. at night; nothing seems to work out this way because I want to text my partners late at night, but you can't do that with a job like that. I also understand that my being asexual doesn't help either. But that doesn't really matter if you're a polyamorous, accepting person. I'm also the type of person that likes to give self-care packages as well. Such as gourmet snacks, gourmet nuts, and luxurious products for the shower like goat milk bars and tea bags. I know I'm weird, but whatever.

There is no light anymore in relationships for me; I don't think there is. There is no sparkle/glimmer of hope in finding relationships anymore; I only see a looming darkness. But perhaps while I sit in the looming darkness, perhaps you can just hear me out and give me a chat?

I will say though, you just have to be spiritual and accepting and not skeptical. That's all. If you're thinking about messaging me but aren't spiritual yourself, it's fine if you're not. Just don't be skeptical; that's all I can ask.

I can't love. I'm sorry, but I can't escape this, and I'm deeply sorry for this painful choice I've made.

Please, don't comment on this post or any of my pinned posts. If you have something to say, then send me a message in my chat request. I want answers if anyone is able to give me friendly answers. Has anyone ever had relationship issues because you tell yourself that you will no longer date again, I'm not worthy to date anyone, I'm lesser, and therefore I'm nothing worthy to my partners?",1,1744351662.0,SadCornerOfGamers,0,1.0,False

She’s someone who makes rules for herself—like not saying “I love you” too soon or only dating shorter fems when she loves tall mascs—but 10/10 times she usually ends up breaking them. About a week ago after her recent last breakup, we had one of our usual coffee shop heart-to-hearts. I encouraged her to focus on herself rather than idealized versions of love, and she actually is putting in the effort to do it. In the present now, She started going on solo dates, reading poetry, working out, and planning to travel.

But during that same conversation of talking about love, I mentioned that my boyfriend Jax (19M) is moving out of state for trade school in less than a year and how I’ll want to travel as well. Her reaction was immediate—she told me I should just break up with him now instead of “settling for nothing but heartbreak.” It caught me off guard. I guess from the outside, it really does look like I’m setting myself up for heartbreak.

For context: Jax and I just hit two months official. He’s a gentleman, hilarious, smart, passionate, thoughtful, and one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. My friends call him my “golden retriever.” My mom loves him because they bond over a disease they both have that used to make her feel isolated, and my dad loves talking sports with him and wants to go to his sports games when he tries out. He’s become a huge joy in my life in such a short time (my family is usually strict so I introduced my bf earlier than most). 

But yeah—he’s leaving. He already drives an hour each way just to see me, and I know once he’s gone, long-distance won’t work for me. The state he’s moving to has nothing for me outside of him. I don’t want to be trapped in a relationship in a state I don’t like and I don’t want to try to stretch something that’s already going to be difficult since he’s going to be working on 

And yet… I’ve thought about this through out our relationship. I’ve cried, laughed, journaled, and reflected. And despite knowing how this ends, I still choose us right now. Not because I’m naive, but because even if it’s short-term, it’s the peace I want rn. I love him. I know he’s probably the one that gets away but I’ll watch and just turn around cause honestly, I’ve made peace with this. He needs to chase his future, and I need to start figuring out mine. We’re not built for long-term compatibility right now, but we still bring something meaningful to each other’s lives.

I guess her reaction though made me pause. Like maybe I AM doing something wrong by holding onto something with an expiration date. She says I’m being unfair—to myself AND to him—but the thing is, we’ve talked about this. We’re both on the same page. We both know it’s likely temporary, and we’re still investing in it because it makes us happy right now. Isn’t that kind of… mature? Or is that just what I’m telling myself to justify it?

I get to enjoy my senior year with someone I genuinely care for—prom, graduation, maybe a trip, and all the little dates in between. Then I’ll shift focus to me: traveling, online classes, discovering who I am and investing in that more.

But sometimes I wonder… AITAH for holding on to love even when I know it can’t last?

I feel crap, and for a long while I didn’t know why. A few years ago I had problems with my tonsils. They were basically inflamed all of the time and I had to take a lot of antibiotics. Finally they were removed. This is when things started. My mental health was at its lowest, I had my very first panic attack, after this, I was anxious 24/7, because I was frightened another panic attack will follow.

Every time I’ve visited my parents for the weekend, I felt so so bad afterwards. When I drove home I was shaking, had the feeling I would pass out. I now know this was a result of eating too much sweet things and drinking too much coke/coffee. 

Fast forward: I once had gastritis and I basically banned everything that is no good to me. For the first time in years I wasn’t anxious when I got back from my parents, my hands weren’t sweaty anymore, I was chill (unfortunately I was quite depressed because I had gastritis) but still I was too stupid to realise it was my abnormal sugar intake causing these symptoms I mentioned above.

Thankfully I found this sub. Currently I am travelling Southeast Asia and there is sugar in basically everything. I am still better than at home at the moment, but still I want to get rid of this poison. Was anybody’s mental health also affected?

Her laptop also runs intel rapid storage with a Hybrid drive, so i tried to install the driver that i downloaded from the manufacturer website but it tells me to contact the manufacturer for an up to date driver, however this is the driver that has been on the laptop for the past 5 years and it is as up to date as it can get.

I will add the source of my driver site for this laptop, i tried the coffee lake version as well as the earlier version, i cannot get either driver to install it shows them as compatible with my hardware in the install window but upon completing the install i get an error line which i can show if necessary but the drive isn't detected.

i try running a command prompt during the install just to see if the drive is recognized at all and 

Disk 0 is the USB im using, so i don't understand why the drive isn't detected because if i run the recovery and try an sfc /scan now it gets through the verification but cancels the scan because the drive is Locked and as i said above i cannot get it to boot up anymore, and this was all caused by a windows update.

the harddrive just don't want to work no more, and this isn't the first instance of me having to recover the system or the first instance of a bluescreen, just wondering if i should be replacing the Hard drive because its consistently corrupting windows boot data or is there another solution that i can try?

Love coffee? Only drink it while working. Got a favorite song? Play it ONLY when tackling that dreaded task. Your brain will start craving productivity like a junkie.

Number 3: The “Just Start” Knife. 

Don’t plan, don’t prep—just say “GO” and take action. Even one tiny move kills hesitation on the spot.

Number 4: The ‘Annoy Yourself Into Action’ Stab.

Stick notes on your mirror. Set alarms labeled “DO IT OR ELSE.” Make procrastination so unbearable that working is the only way out!

And finally, Number 5: The Momentum Assassination.

**RE: CEASE AND DESIST – MISUSE OF MY NAME FOR PETTY HUMAN AGENDA**

Dear [Name Redacted for Mercy],

It has come to My omniscient attention that you have been repeatedly using My name, image, and words to justify your personal biases, judgmental behavior, and disturbingly creative interpretations of My message. I must remind you, once again, that **""God said so""** is not a valid excuse for bigotry, control, or being a generally insufferable person.

This letter serves as a **formal divine Cease and Desist**. You are hereby instructed to immediately stop:

1. Quoting Scripture you didn’t read in full context.  
2. Using Me as an excuse to be cruel to others.  
3. Acting like I personally endorsed your political opinions.  
4. Pretending your hatred is “holy.”

For the record, I do **not** support your self-appointed title as “God’s favorite,” nor your TikTok sermons, nor your motivational coffee mugs that say “#Blessed (and better than you).”

I gave humanity free will and a conscience. Please begin using both. Remember: I am Love, not your personal PR team. If I wanted to smite people, I wouldn’t need your help.

Failure to comply will result in the following divine consequences:

- Revocation of your “Holier Than Thou” badge  
- Eternal side-eye from the angels  
- All your future prayers going straight to spam  

You’ve read the Good Book—now try *living* it.

Because I'm really enjoying living alone in my own space. But the small/old apartment lifestyle has conspired against me. I'm usually a pretty chill person, and even when I get annoyed I'm pretty understanding about the circumstances. But for the first time in a long time, I feel like I wanna throw a tantrum. 

Fair warning, I don't really want solutions or advice. I just wanna hear about your own terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day for apartment dwellers stories. I want commiseration.

I'm a night owl, so since I moved in in December I've been looking forward to spending spring nights out on my balcony, reading or writing, sipping coffee, etc. I even went out and bought the smallest comfy outdoor chair I could find to fit the space. And then two weeks ago we got notice that they'd be starting construction on the balconies to bring them up to code. They started on mine last week. They used a jack hammer to tear up the concrete floor. Two picture frames fell off my walls, a stack of books flopped off a shelf, and lights I'd hung with command strips were vibrated off the walls. Add to this the fact I work from home on a hybrid schedule and have pets who were utterly terrified for all of the 1st day and most of the 2nd.... I spent half my work day jumping out of my skin at random construction sounds, and the other half comforting my pets.

There was no warning about the jack hammer, or that we might experience that kind of shaking and vibration. On the notice they simply said to prepare for ""structural and stucco demolition and construction."" Fine, maybe I'm the idiot who didn't anticipate my entire apartment experiencing a small earthquake for hours at a time.

I had to put my pets into carriers and take them to my sister's on the days I went into the office. Which meant I also disrupted her daily routine.

Because the laundry closet is off the side of the balcony, I haven't been able to do laundry all week. They told us in the notice that we'd have access to our own laundry on weekends, but the workers told me yesterday that I might not have a balcony floor come Friday (tomorrow).

So, since today is my birthday and I really wanted to spend it alone, on my balcony in the spring evening doing something artistic or creative, I picked up my pets from my sister's after work, brought them home, settled them in, and then decided Starbucks would be the next best option. I looked up the local stores and deliberately chose the one that the app said had a lobby open until 10pm. Cut to 8:55pm, and the sweet Starbucks employee politely warned me they'd be closing in 5 minutes.

So I left and sat in my car for 15 min, trying to figure out where else I could go to try and slavage my night. Turns out the only place with free wifi and coffee open past 9pm in my area is a Corky's 24hr diner half an hour away from me. By the time I headed back to my apartment, even DQ was already closed.

I know it's a weeknight, but honestly I've lived in tiny towns who have more nightlife than my new city. Even when I lived in a similar metropolitan area, most places were open until 10/11pm.

I just wanted to enjoy my first birthday alone in my own space. And now, for the foreseeable future, I can't even enjoy the nice spring weather from the comfort of my own balcony.",5,1744349619.0,Apartmentliving,1,1.0,False

🃏 **Cards Pulled:** The Moon (Reversed) & Knight of Pentacles

# 🌙 A Moment from Today:

It’s always the little things that sneak up on you. I had a pretty standard day—morning coffee, checked in with my team, knocked out a couple of Jira tickets. But around mid-afternoon, I noticed this nagging unease creeping in. Couldn’t really explain it. No obvious reason. It was just… there.

I tried to shake it off by going for a walk, which helped a little. The sky was that weird overcast that looks like it wants to rain but won’t commit. Kind of matched my mood. I’ve been doing better lately—more motivated, getting stuff done—but today had that vague foggy feeling, like my brain was trying to tell me something without giving me the full picture.

Later in the evening, I sat down and did some pixel art again. It wasn’t great. I kept second-guessing myself and redoing the same line over and over. I think I ended up with a mushroom sprite that looks like it’s confused about its own existence. So, progress?

# 🔮 Tarot Reflection:

The Moon reversed felt way too on the nose. It’s that “I’m anxious but don’t know why” energy. Stuff lurking in the background, unspoken thoughts, half-processed emotions. That was today in a nutshell. Nothing bad happened, but I still felt weirdly off. Like I’m wading through shallow fog—not lost, but not totally clear either.

Then there’s the Knight of Pentacles, which made me laugh a bit. That card is all about steady, grounded effort. And honestly? That’s probably what saved me today. Even though my mind was messy, I still did the work. I showed up. That slow and steady rhythm—the checklist, the tiny routines—kept me from spiraling. Again.

These two cards together hit on a pattern I’ve been noticing lately: my emotions sometimes lag behind the progress I’m making. I might be *doing well* on paper, but inside, there’s still noise I haven’t sorted out. But maybe that’s okay. Maybe showing up through the noise *is* the win.

# 🧠 Thought of the Day:

Something i can set up on a coffee shop, office, my bed, and carry in my backpack without worrying about battery life. Honestly, my ideal laptop may just be a macbook air. I just prefer Linux machines so i don't need to relearn my workflow. i just wanted to know is there a laptop as good as a macbook that has fantastic battery life that i can slap linux on

**Total budget:** 1000-1500USD (+/-200USD if the laptop is good enough, lower is better)

**Are you open to refurbs/used?** Yes, so long as there is no obvious cosmetic damage

**How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life? (in order of preference)**  
I'd prefer an ultrabook. My top priority is battery life and build quality. Something with a very good keyboard and a 2-day battery life. I'd like a pretty screen too, something with OLED but a very good 1080p+ LCD is okay too (2k is preferable). 

**How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Something as thin as a macbook pro.

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
14 inches and up

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
I do not need to video edit or CAD. I will be using mostly web browsers, note taking apps, company software, text editors, zoom etc. I will be running multiple apps at a time so i need something that won't stutter

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
gaming is NOT a priority on this machine. I may emulate, but honestly something that emulates Wii games well is all i need

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
Good keyboard, Build quality, good webcam, and touch pad are priority. A good screen is also up there. Something that is fun to use

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
Honestly, the computer i am describing here is a MacBook. Again, i want to know if there is a suitable laptop equivalent that can run Linux. There are the windows Snapdragon laptops out there which are fantastic, but that specific CPU is not supported on Linux. Asahi Linux on a Mac is not yet ready enough for my daily use. Is there an x86 laptop with fantastic 2 day battery life, great build quality and a pretty screen out there?",1,1744349035.0,SuggestALaptop,0,1.0,False

I’ve been drinking green tea consistently for the past month, and I wanted to share some of the [green tea benefits](https://www.rippletea.com/collections/green-tea) I’ve personally experienced — plus hear from others who might be on the same journey.

# Here are a few green tea benefits I’ve noticed:

* **Improved digestion**
* **Gentle energy without the coffee crash**
* **Fewer sugar cravings**
* **Smoother skin (surprisingly!)**

Of course, everyone’s body is different, but the research behind green tea benefits seems pretty solid — antioxidants, metabolism support, and even heart health. I’m curious to know:

* What are your go-to types of green tea?
* Have you experienced any unexpected results?
* Any downsides I should watch out for?

Picture a vault—sealed tight inside your skull—leaking vaporized neurotoxin every time you chew your food, grind your teeth, or sip hot coffee. You can’t see it, can’t smell it, but it’s there. A ticking biological time bomb, installed not by a rogue agent, but by a licensed professional.

This isn’t the start of a sci-fi thriller. This is the very real danger of mercury amalgam fillings, quietly wreaking havoc in mouths around the world. And it’s been happening for over 150 years.

In Austin, Texas, a horrifying personal health crisis put this issue in the spotlight. One dental appointment in 2007 turned catastrophic when a patient who specifically requested porcelain fillings was instead given more mercury—without consent.

That mercury-filled tooth nearly killed them.

By 2016, the filling had deteriorated. Chronic migraines, extreme fatigue, erratic heart rhythms, and finally a blackout that led to a collapse through an open dishwasher. Blood pressure surged to 190/120. ER doctors suspected arrhythmia, possibly atrial fibrillation. But nothing added up.

Except one thing: the tooth.

When the molar was finally removed, the dentist refused to return it, citing “environmental toxicity.” Think about that. It was too toxic to dispose of legally, but somehow safe enough to live with, inches from the brain.

This story isn’t an outlier. It’s a warning.

The Mercury Timeline: How Did We Get Here?

1830s – Mercury fillings (also called “silver amalgam”) were introduced by French dentists, then popularized in the U.S. by the Crawcour brothers. Dentists rebelled against them at first, calling them unethical and dangerous.

1845 – The American Society of Dental Surgeons demanded members sign pledges not to use mercury. Those who refused were expelled. The society disbanded shortly after, and mercury became widespread.

1980s–90s – Public health officials began raising concerns about chronic mercury exposure. European nations started banning or phasing out amalgams.

2008 – Norway, Sweden, and Denmark banned mercury fillings entirely due to health and environmental concerns.

2020 – The U.S. FDA updated its stance, advising against mercury amalgams for:

Pregnant women

Nursing mothers

Children under 6

People with kidney problems or neurological disorders

Anyone with a heightened sensitivity to mercury


2024 – A growing movement in the U.S. is calling for a complete ban.



---

The Real Science Behind the Scare

Mercury doesn’t sit still. It's constantly off-gassing vapor—especially when heated by chewing, brushing, grinding, or hot drinks. This vapor is absorbed directly into the bloodstream via the lungs and oral mucosa.

A University of Calgary study showed that mercury vapor from fillings can cross the blood-brain barrier, accumulating in areas linked to memory, mood, and motor control.

According to a 2016 study by IAOMT, even a single amalgam filling can release up to 17 micrograms of mercury per day. The EPA’s safe limit? Less than 0.3 micrograms per cubic meter.


---

Is It a Cover-Up?

Some experts argue we’re facing a slow-motion public health disaster—one too entangled in politics, insurance, and pharmaceutical profits to address easily.

A popular theory suggests that ""The Dental Mercury Cover-Up"" began in the 19th century when amalgams became a cheaper, easier solution. Dental schools, backed by industry-funded research, promoted mercury as “safe and effective,” downplaying the mounting toxicity concerns.

Yet the ADA (American Dental Association) still claims mercury fillings are safe, even as other countries label them hazardous waste.

Why the contradiction?

Follow the money.

Dental mercury is cheaper, faster, and easier to place than porcelain or composite. And since it lasts decades, it ensures longer patient dependency—root canals, crowns, and implants often follow deteriorating fillings.


---

Detox That Works: Truth or Trend?

Following their emergency, the Austin-based survivor turned to natural detoxification—a field often ridiculed by mainstream medicine but now gaining serious traction.

Parsley water, activated coconut charcoal, and distilled water were used in a heavy-metal flushing protocol. Within two weeks, the heart stabilized. Within three, all symptoms vanished. No medication. No surgery.

According to Dr. Chris Shade, a leading mercury detox specialist, natural binders like chlorella, modified citrus pectin, and liposomal glutathione are showing immense promise in removing mercury from organs and tissue.


---

What About Root Canals?

This opens another Pandora’s box.

Root canals, often performed after a filling fails, can harbor anaerobic bacteria deep in microscopic dentin tubules. According to research by Dr. Weston A. Price, these bacteria may release neurotoxins linked to systemic illnesses, including heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and even cancer.

Critics call this outdated or anecdotal—but many holistic practitioners report patients experiencing immediate relief after removing infected root-canaled teeth.

The debate rages on. But one thing is clear: dental health is whole-body health.


---

The Next Frontier: Biohacking Your Mouth

In the age of biohacking, AI diagnostics, and personalized health apps, the mouth is becoming the next frontier. Startups are developing saliva sensors to detect heavy metals in real time. TikTok influencers are going viral sharing “tooth detox” journeys—highlighting #ParasiteCleanse, #HeavyMetalDetox, and #HolisticDentistry.

Even high-level wellness influencers like Ben Greenfield, Dave Asprey, and Dr. Mark Hyman have joined the chorus, warning about hidden dental threats and recommending pre-removal detox regimens.


---

So What Can You Do?

Get a panoramic X-ray or cone-beam scan to assess old fillings and root canals.

Never remove mercury fillings without a SMART-certified dentist—removal can be more dangerous than leaving them in if done incorrectly.

Start gentle detox: parsley, cilantro, chlorella, activated charcoal, and sauna therapy.

Switch to fluoride-free, remineralizing toothpaste with hydroxyapatite or clay minerals.

Use a water distiller or fluoride filter—tap water can interact with metals in your mouth.

Consider hair mineral analysis or urine testing for heavy metal load.



---

It’s time to stop looking at teeth as just cosmetic features—and start seeing them as living, chemical hubs of the body.

Millions walk around with ticking time bombs hidden beneath crowns and fillings. Mercury is not inert. It’s not outdated conspiracy. It’s a medical fact. The only question left is:

How long will we keep ignoring it?

1jwidgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1jwidgf/my_mom_lies_about_being_on_ozempic/,My mom lies about being on Ozempic,"My mom was always very, very heavy. She claims she was ""never above 250 pounds,"" but I would be surprised if she below 450, for the last 15ish years. Honestly. She was wearing a size 6XL, for reference. Developed Type III Diabetes about 10 years ago. 

She's dropped (I'm guessing) about 100 pounds in the last couple of years. I remember before dropping weight she was very nauseated and had tummy problems, said it was from a new diabetes medicine she was on. I asked her multiple times if it was Ozempic (which was newly mainstream at the time) and she said no, but wouldn't say what medicine it was. 

So she starts dropping weight quickly and constantly talks to my brother and me about it (we're both heavy too -- my mom always tortured me about my weight as a kid). She tells us about how she's dieting strictly (which was obviously a lie, she had McDonald's for breakfast every single day for starters), and was ""more active."" I mean it was just constant talk of how great she was doing. The weight loss was noticed by everyone, although the weight was only coming off her top half and not her legs, so she still can barely walk to this day.  But whatever. 

I can barely have a conversation with her without her asking me if I had ""another sugary coffee drink"" or something along those lines, then my brother visits my parents' house last summer. He tells me he found Ozempic in the fridge, hidden. He brings it up to my dad who says it's supposed to be a secret from us. 

What kind of game is this, lol. Keeping Ozempic a secret????? What is even the goal???

I saw her not too long ago and she was telling me about how she ""doesn't eat much"" and watches her portions, but I saw her eat a shit ton of food 🤣 I kept calling her out for saying that, but it made her upset. Honestly, I'm not even surprised by her anymore. Always been a liar.

1jwibca,https://i.redd.it/96xkgaq245ue1.jpeg,M26 minimalist edc,"iPhone 12 and a black temu wallet.

These are the only two things I carry with me almost every day unless I’m traveling or know I’ll be staying overnight at someone else’s place. 

I know it’s a bit of an odd setup and not for everyone. I just personally got addicted to traveling lite. In general, I like having cheap things that I can beat up and not have to worry if I lose them. I used to carry my backpack everywhere and have much more of the edc staples (flashlights, multi-tools, a mountain of chargers and power banks, etc) but I would always lose things or never use them. One day someone pick-pocketed a very expensive item from my bag and I was like fuck this I’ll try carrying the bare minimum for a while. So far I’ve really enjoyed it but I definitely still have that itch for carrying more gear. 

The phone has a screen protector but I like keeping it naked otherwise. Pulling it out of my pocket is a breeze and it never really slips out accidentally as much as you think it would. When it does, I notice immediately because I only ever have one thing in each pocket 😅

The wallet is technically called “automatic up credit card wallet” (its name varies- this is what it’s called on temu, the $3.79 one). It’s made of metal with a cloth pouch. I only keep my license and one debit card in it with some cash. All my other cards stay home. 

I’ve used the wallet every day for about a year and have almost no complaints. The mechanism to push the cards out still works and nothing ever falls out of the pouch. You can kind of hear the lever jiggling in your pocket though which can be a little annoying. 

I put my house key under the mat when I leave and take public transport everywhere (I use my phone for that card). When it gets warm out I like biking. I use a shitty $100 bike with an equally shitty $5 lock and that’s it. It didn’t get stolen last summer thankfully- but if it does In the future I feel like I already got my money’s worth haha.

Ive dropped my phone a few times but it’s actually been pretty durable- Especially if you don’t care about little dings in the corner! I used to not be able to leave the house without headphones, and it’s still a little tough not gonna lie. The silence when you’re walking down the street can get pretty lonely- but when I feel like that I’ll usually take the time to call a friend or family member just to check in and say hi. Going without podcasts has forced me to actually use my phone as a phone! Haha. Not worrying about losing my AirPods or one of them not be charged has been a nice bonus.

The phone is starting to show its age- battery health is like 77%. I kind of like that it forces me to use my screen-time sparingly however. Not carrying my extra credit cards has definitely saved me from some impulse purchases as well. 

The only thing I’m really considering adding to my edc is a small pocket knife of some kind. I find myself having to tear or cut something a few times a week (like a package or instant coffee packet) and I always just use my teeth. I know that’s really bad for you long term, but I also worry about a knife scratching the phone or the cloth part of the wallet. A necklace knife might be a good idea- but I’d wanna get a black, metal one to match everything else which sounds pricey haha.

I know SO many people (including myself) have been told that what we experience is ""just anxiety"". Well now I have experienced both in the same hour and I can tell you they are NOT the same.   
I had to go to a dentist yesterday and have had anxiety about dental work my whole life (from problems as a kid). So when I started out (about a 45 min drive) I was TRULY actually ANXIOUS-like mental squirreliness, wanting to barf, agitated...I've had a lot of anxiety in my life so I know it when I feel it. And it wasn't the same nausea I get with a histamine problem either...

Since my dx of MCAS/HAPOTS I also sometimes get those adrenal surges/histamines dumps. The first bad one sent me to the ER, so I remember what that felt like and an antihistamine calmed it down.   
For me they ALWAYS come after eating something high in histamine (or old) and frequently they seem to happen while driving. (I have noted I generally eat a meal before driving or a few times had milk instead of cream at a coffee shop which also triggered it.) That is NOT anxiety. It's that weird ""something's wrong"" feeling that is calmed by antihistamines.   
I haven't had one in a while, but while driving to the dentist yesterday, AFTER I had sort of calmed down with the actual anxiety (I made my husband come with me), I had one of those dumps.  
And having both so close together I can definitely say they are NOT the same.

Went back to my car and found a Mario game that must’ve fallen out of the Switch, went back and sold the game for $50. A few days later my tire blew out. 

I have hundreds of these stories. Sometimes the good luck is minor. 2 days in a row strangers paid for my food and then I won a gift card for coffee. Sometimes the bad luck is major and usually car related.

It’s probably some psychological phenomenon where I just so happen to notice a “pattern” and attribute it to something that’s not really there. Regardless, I do feel insanely lucky, and maybe me believing that I am lucky is what makes it true.

1jwi1qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1jwi1qf/the_crossing_of_crowbars/,The Crossing of Crowbars,"
Jonathan didn’t mean to fall for her.

It started with a collision. A crowded sidewalk, two pairs of eyes meeting for a moment too long, a mumbled apology—and then she was gone. But something lingered. Not just her face or the smell of her perfume. It was a pull. A gut-deep certainty that she was important. Vital.

He tried to shake it. He told himself it was nothing. That he was being weird.

But by that night, she had rooted herself in his mind like a parasite. Everything reminded him of her. Every face was her face. He started walking that same sidewalk every day, hoping to see her again. He scanned social media, surveillance cams, accident reports. Nothing.

Until he found her.

A first name overheard in the background of a video someone else had posted. A lucky guess tied to a school. From there, it wasn’t hard. He was good at this kind of thing. And when he finally saw the address on his screen, a shiver ran down his spine.

That night, he dressed in black. Gloves. Crowbar. Balaclava stuffed in his coat pocket. He didn’t know what he wanted exactly—just to see her, maybe. Watch her for a bit. Understand her. Be close.

Her house was empty. No lights. No sound.

He broke in easily. Too easily. The place was tidy, warm even, with small signs of her life scattered throughout—books, a sweater on the couch, a mug in the sink. He wandered through the rooms slowly, soaking it in like incense. But something about it felt... off. Too neat. Too quiet.

She wasn’t there. And without her, the house felt hollow.

He left disappointed, the crowbar heavier in his hand than when he came.

Danielle hadn’t meant to fixate either.

She just couldn’t stop thinking about the guy she’d run into. Literally. There was something about him—something off. But off in the way a song sticks in your head because one note is just slightly wrong. It haunted her.

She searched. Dug. Tracked.

She found him.

That night, she put on black. Gloves. A cloth laced with chloroform folded in her coat. The goal was vague—see what he was like, understand who he was, maybe confront him if the opportunity felt right. She wasn’t sure what she’d do. She just had to do something.

His apartment was empty. Sterile. It felt like no one really lived there. But there were clues—scraps of writing, notes on his wall, a drawing she’d swear was of her. It sent a thrill down her spine.

And then the disappointment set in. No Jonathan. No answers. She left, invisible once more, bitterness simmering just beneath her skin.

On the way home, under a flickering streetlight, they saw each other.

They both stopped.

Neither said a word at first. Jonathan’s crowbar hung at his side. Danielle’s fingers clutched her coat tight around the hidden rag. Their clothes matched, both wearing black from neck to boot. And both faces twisted in confusion, then recognition.

“You,” she said, not quite a question.

Jonathan tilted his head. “Yeah.”

A pause.

“What are you doing out here?” she asked.

“Walking,” he said carefully. “You?”

“Same.”

The silence returned. Awkward. Charged.

Then, at the same moment, they both lunged.

Danielle’s hand shot forward, reaching into her coat. Jonathan raised his crowbar, eyes wide, defensive.

They collided again, but this time, with violence instead of romance. He pinned her wrist against the wall. She twisted, knocking the crowbar loose. The chloroform cloth fluttered to the ground.

Both of them froze.

They stared at each other, panting, eyes wide.

Jonathan blinked first, then burst out laughing. “You were gonna chloroform me?”

Jonathan gave her a baffled half-smile. “You broke into my house, didn’t you?”

“You broke into mine!” she shot back, still breathless. “Jesus Christ.”

There was a pause. Then, slowly, Jonathan started to laugh, too.

“I thought I was the crazy one,” he said.

“You are,” Danielle said, smiling. “But apparently I’m worse.”

They stood like that for a while, on the edge of something unspoken. Something deeply messed up. Something strangely perfect.

Jonathan bent down, picked up the crowbar, and then held it out to her like a peace offering.

Danielle took it, turned it in her hands, and then tucked it under her arm.

“Wanna go get coffee?” she asked.

“I was thinking something stronger.”

They walked off side by side, black clothes blending into the dark.

Two broken hearts, armed and dangerous, beating in sync for the first time.

And for them, that was enough.",1,1744347609.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1jwi0hs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwi0hs,Shocking possible termite infestation with hidden damage. We are living in Northern California. Several affected rooms in the house.,"Ok, so this is my mothers house, built in 1953. She first noticed the coffee grain looking droppings about 5 to 6 years ago. Kepted cleaning/vacuuming and days to weeks later the droppings woupd be back. Looks like typical termite frass, although we didn’t realize it back then. These pile on the table coincide with and are directly under the wood beams from the ceiling, but there are other areas that have the termite frass along certain baseboards of her house. Well, what was once small piles are far more widespread now and spanning different areas of different rooms. Her house is basically falling apart, there have been leaks on the roof in different areas of the house as well. I guess I’m looking for any info and from anyone’s experience here, how bad does this infestation look? And why is it we can’t see the actual damage? Is this possibly hidden termite damage? The infestation spans through several rooms. The worse room is obviously the one in the photos. There are two other rooms that have these same droppings, but on the carpets under where the windows are.

Although I’m scared to ask, how expensive could this damage be to fix?",2,1744347473.0,Termites,2,1.0,False

I go home. I go home. 

I have one friend, she's also my roommate. I can't get her to do anything with me anymore. I can't get her to go out (as in ""let's go to the mall!"" Or ""let's get lunch!""), I can barely get her to talk to me but then I get to listen to her talk and play video games with her online friends through the wall. 

So I do everything alone. I do everything I am supposed to. 

I enrich my life, I do my hobbies, i go for walks, i go to therapy, and to class. I'm just so tired of doing it alone. At first it was fun, ""oh I'm going thrifting! And I can wear my earbuds and spend whatever time I want on what I want to!"" 

It's not fun anymore. I'm tired of eating cold stone alone in my car. I'm tired of finding stupid shirts while thrifting and having no one to show. I'm tired of having small talk conversations with strangers because there's no one else to talk to. 

I go to my classes in college, I try to make friends but it feels like there's some sort of joke I never understand. They have all they need and I am just here. 

And I am so tired of it! I start the conversations! I do all the things! Why doesn't it work for me? Why doesn't anyone like me? Why am I always doing it alone?? I do all the things! I do everything I'm supposed to! Everyone always says I'm so much fun, I'm such a people person, and that I'm funny. So why doesn't anyone want to be my friend?? Why is it ALWAYS school acquaintance, work acquaintance, gym acquaintance?? Why am I not worth more than that?

I'm just tired of being alone! I could probably go DAYS without saying a word and no one would even notice. I'm SICK of it. It was supposed to get better. I got less shy, I learned how to speak and it hasn't. It's gotten so much worse. 

It wasn't supposed to be like this. I've always been able to do things alone. I'm happy that I can do things alone. But I'm tired of *having* to do them alone.",3,1744347419.0,Vent,3,1.0,False

We're expecting a huge turnout later tonight at Joe's Pizza. Been getting messages from a. few of our out of town members, who will come.  Add those to !all the kids that normally attend, and the new members, who have started coming... we're looking at 20+ players this evening at Joe's. Feel free to join in. Bringing a board/clock would be appreciated.  

Saturday, we were scheduled to resume Oj Macs, but it's still cold. It's also going to be rainy. So, we're rescheduling for future dates...when weather is at least in the 60s.

Saturday afternoon from 5pm to 10 pm, we have a combo gaming event at Mom and Pop Shop Collectibles.  Bring it. Play it. Or just play from the selection we have. Clash Of Scrabble Titans is still going on. 

FINALLY, Sunday, we're at Carmelo Bakery. We're there from 1pm to 5pm. Come get a delicious pastry or sandwich . Grab a cup of coffee. Just chill over a game or some chess. Another combo event.  

Then it starts all over again on Monday, when we're back at The Vic. 

More videos have been added to the club's YouTube channel.

Also, if you're looking for an excellent way to better your chess, or help a loved one learn or improve their chess...remember, we have a 20% promo code for the excellent Chessnut E-Boards.  The promo code is higher than their own promo code on their website.  Hikaru Nakamura is a spokesman for them now too.

1jwhz15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jwhz15/aitah_for_talking_to_my_best_friends_ex/,AITAH for talking to my best friends ex,"Background: My best friend Terese(39F) and I (35F) have been friends for 7 years, bonding when we had our daughters a the same time (both 6F) they have become best friends. 
Her partner Kyle(41m) is my friend from my ex husband (39m) and I have known Kyle 12 years. He is also my other friends Saras (39f) brother. Kyle has been with my closer friend group for 7 of those years. Terese and kyle are childhood sweethearts and rekindled 7 years ago. We had always hung out as two couples. I had seperated from my husband  early 2024. They were on and off the past year but ended officially December 2025. Custody of our kids ended up being opposite weekends to eachother as her ex kyle has previous kids. 

Problem started when I had to see Kyle alone so we can have our girls spend time together. So this was the first time we had not seen eachother outside our friendship group. We just chatted while our kids played. 
A week later we had a cyclone in our city and my back fence was broken so I asked Terese if I could ask her landscape carpenter ex Kyle to help me fix it. She said no problem. And I asked him directly. It took a few weeks but we agreed on a day we both had off. He came and fixed the fence and left. The afternoon he messaged and asked if I wanted to have coffee with him as I was really easy to talk to. 

I was a little taken back but assumed he meant he needed someone to talk to as he didn't have any friends that knows what's going on with everything. I lied and said I had to work because I only wanted to see him around the kids, but if he wanted to get coffee another time if he needed to talk let me know.  

A week later school holidays are up and again unfortunately we had the kids in the same week as her ex. So my daughter nagged me to see her best friend so I messaged him to ask to go to a local playground so they can play. He agreed. 

This is where i went wrong i believe, That afternoon, Kyle randomly messaged me saying I know we don't have the kids tonight do you want to hang out. I reluctant agreed seeing what he wanted to do. said dinner at the pub. And after asking what tine kyle added he would pick me up at 6.

This ending comment made me feel a little uneasy but did not want to jump to conclusions and rang the guy im seeing Mitch (35m) and asked his opinion. He said just make it clear its as friends and see how he reacts. I rang my friend terese and told her what happend and just to let her know before she thought anything of it. 
Terese told me she had a fight with Kyle earlier that very day after finding out we had planned a play date and warned him of not trying to hook up with me. 
This was a shock to me and I felt angry that his first thought was to ask me out alone. I told him just to make sure u know its just friends and you need to talk. KY
kyle cancelled. Shocker. 
I rang Terese back and caught her up. She said she didn't mind us being friends but not to hook up with him. As this wasn't even going through my mind I didn't think much of it. But angry that he could be getting the wrong idea. 

The next day terese messaged me and said she cannot be my friend anymore and that I have been hiding seeing Kyle behind her back and a friend wouldn't do that. I was shocked as I hadn't seen him without her knowledge and as far as I knew she didn't care if I were friends with him. She got the other girls in my group (2others which are also his sisters sarah and Nina) against me now and they all have stopped talking to me. 
I have found out since he told all three that we had gone for a coffee together to chat (which is not true at all) 
But I have not thought of him like that at all and I felt blindsighted and stupid I did not see that he was hitting on me to get back at her. If that is what was going on.

First one-bag trip down: 11 days in the PNW,"A follow-up to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1j95ncy/11_days_in_the_pacific_northwest_in_late_march/) :) after a whirlwind of a conference and a PNW road trip, I'm home and feeling pretty content with my first successful one-bag trip! ...well, 1.5, but I'm okay with that. 

of note: a couple weeks before my trip I sprained my ankle and have had to use a knee scooter, which called for a lot of adjustment to my plans but also made me very glad to be carrying only a carry-on, and especially a backpack! 

**Photos:** 

1. main bag (Osprey Fairview 40L) and purse (Baggu Medium Crescent knockoff); packing cubes, toiletry bag, and some corralled odds and ends (AeroPress, traveler's notebook, travel pillow, bag of souvenirs)
2. clothes I ended up bringing: 3 tank/shell tops, 3 button downs, 1 thermal long sleeved top, 2 sweaters, 1 blazer, 4 pairs pants. 
3. most of my outfits (the rest were mix and match)
4. toiletries - kept a couple powders/pencils in the pink makeup bag, other toiletries in various pockets of the gray bag, and liquids in a separate ziploc bag for TSA
5. purse contents (roughly L-->R): iPad mini + keyboard, Muji travel wallet, pouch for charging cables/brick, notebook (removed from traveler's notebook) & pens, reusable tote bag, elastic bandage, EarPeace earplugs, Bose wireless earbuds, chapstick, hand sanitizer, assorted medications, pouch for smaller hygiene items like hairbrush/bandaids/floss

\*not pictured: beanie, gaiter, merino base layer leggings, puffer/shell combo, socks/underwear/bras

**Main places visited after Portland (in rough order):** Mt. Hood; Columbia River Gorge; Depoe Bay/Newport, OR; various spots along the 101/Oregon coast; Mt. Rainier NP; Seattle; Olympic NP 

**What worked/MVPs:**

* Osprey Fairview: I got this backpack a couple months ago after testing it and having it custom fit in REI. This was my first time actually using it and it was a dream - the load lifters and hip belt are game changers!
* Baggu Medium Crescent: tbh not my preferred form factor (I prefer a bit more built-in organization to a ""black hole"") but it worked well for traveling. fit my iPad and everything else I wanted close at hand, and I do like that it stays close to my body.
* iPad Mini + keyboard: portable and powerful! I could do most of the work I needed to for the conference, and afterward I mostly used it for entertainment. I prefer my Kobo for reading but didn't want to bring both; the iPad was just okay for reading but great for watching a movie on the plane.
* 2 pairs Gnara pants: worked for both business casual and outdoorsy situations. They are truly water repellent which was perfect for the PNW. Unfortunately didn't get to wear them for climbing but before I sprained my ankle they were wonderful for that too :D
* I traded the light blue cashmere sweater from my initial list for a sweater tank that's similar in color. That was comfy, good for layering, and still felt professional. 
* Traveler's notebook: I've brought this thing to multiple conferences and on other trips and it's excellent. I have it set up with one notebook for scheduling, one for journaling, and a clear vinyl pocket for holding tickets/stickers/etc. It's extremely versatile and customizable!
* inflatable travel pillow: almost didn't bring this but was glad I did. helpful for elevating my ankle in the evenings, and also used it as a supplemental pillow one night when I needed more head/neck support.
* EarPeace earplugs: tbh I just forgot to take these out of my bag (usually only use them for concerts) but they did come in handy for sleeping & when the world was a little overwhelming haha

**What I didn't use but wouldn't drop:**

* Merino wool leggings: temperatures were never very cold for very long, but I love these and they're handy to have around in case of a cold snap, or for pajamas
* Gaiter: it's versatile and lightweight, could have used it as a scarf if needed, just didn't need to
* Aeropress Go: a bit bulky but I hate the possibility of being without coffee so to me it's worth it 

**What I'd do differently:** 

* Still working on not ""packing for my fears"" as they say - I could have dropped a few clothing items (one of the navy tank tops, the pair of joggers) and been fine
* Integrate my formal/professional outfits more with my casual outfits. I knew this would be a challenge based on my personality and the nature of the trip--I like to keep work and leisure separate and that's not always realistic when one-bagging. I didn't end up wearing the black blazer/pants at all outside of my presentation; in the future, I'll make more of an effort to wear all the pieces I bring multiple times (and maybe look for professional pieces that are navy/grey instead of black!)
* On a related note...I probably should have left behind the blazer. the conference wasn't *that* formal--I could have gotten away with just a nice top. good to know for next time!

Something that might take someone 2 hours to do might take me the whole day. So I’ve struggled in finding other work in addition to my part time simply because I’m not like completing tasks fast enough for my current part time and it’s not bc I don’t understand the work, but it’s because 

1. I’ll fall asleep when I get bored. 

I get 8-10hrs every night and even then I will fall asleep. I’ll move to coffee shops work with a friend and I still struggle and I’ll take naps even in the shops sometimes. 

2. It’s not that I can’t stay awake bc I’m tired but I literally can’t get myself to do the work bc it’s not interesting enough. I can definitely focus and stay awake for things that are more um idk stimulating to me?

I’ll be cleaning or maybe researching about topics I like and read about those things. Talk to AI about existential things (I’ve always thought about these things even as a teenager it’s not like I’m going through an existential crisis rn although maybe I am but I mean I naturally always think about topics related to this) or things I’m curious about (anthropology, history, religion/philosophy, etc). So everyday I’m going online surfing with the topics that naturally interest me more. So there is evidence I can focus. 

3. I’ve deleted social media and try to limit other obvious distractions but even like opening my email or tabs and for things I need to do work also like distract me. 

Or might overwhelm me, but I might have a task to like check an email but like something else will come to mind because of looking at ads that come up or seeing other emails that remind me to respond to other people unrelated to the work I’m supposed to be finishing. Anyways then I’m like oh wait what was it that I was supposed to be doing? I am known to go on tangents when talking and also never answering questions directly because of unnecessary context I give before realizing I didn’t answer the question and have to recall what was asked. The same way goes for how I approach doing tasks in work.  

4. I struggle with perfectionism  and I have had a history of anxiety my whole life due to trauma and me sucking rn in my work habits is taking a toll on my self esteem and making me start to question my competence, so idk if it’s bc I might have adhd or bc I’m worried all the time that it’s affecting my focus.

I was in therapy for sometime but had to stop because I couldn’t afford it but she felt I didn’t have adhd and more chronic anxiety that affected what I did that ended up with me being in a vicious cycle. 

Ex: anxious all the time bc of survival —> affects my focus in work —> take longer to finish so I can’t find other source of income to live no just survive  —> get paid to just survive so no incentive to wake up since I can’t do what I love —> depressed and oversleeping —> cycle repeats

5. When I sit in front of my laptop for work I literally cannot get myself to do the job. 

I want to but I can’t! Unless there is a deadline that’s when my brain switches on and the sense of urgency is enough for me to do the work cramming it to get the task finished the night before the deadline. Like why????? 😭 I’m not trying to procrastinate but it’s like that’s one of the reasons to make me actually work. I’ll sit hours in front of my laptop feeling guilty not doing the work and trying to get myself to and just thinking about random stuff stressing and then hours go by and then im like shit where did the time go!?!? 

6. I struggled with taking extra work in addition to the part time to get more money.

I took on extra work as a freelancer for autonomy in addition to the part time but this was my first time with freelancing (and the industry I’m in I’m new) so it felt like the whole time I had imposter syndrome and I couldn’t even get myself to open the emails of my client bc I was so terrified she was gonna find me a fraud and fire me and the I would have to go back to being broke. I literally had my Roomate open and summarize the emails for me because I couldn’t do it. It just made me feel better I guess. And my Roomate was like you cannot go on like this and I was like I’m just terrified I’ll go back to being so broke I don’t want to so idk why I’m like scared this person will fire me and then I like broke down. I ended up finishing the project for that client and she seemed happy. I definitely didn’t do it perfectly but I didn’t bother to reach out for referrals or to see if she had more work because that took such a toll on me emotionally and mentally. Also because I took on this job I neglected the part time job a bit and my boss for my part time noticed which made me feel even more guilt and like a sense of incompetence since I couldn’t even manage doing this freelancing gig + part time.

 7. Something that I’ve noticed that has helped is breaking things into smaller steps like 1. Open google chrome 2. Open email. 3. Find email for xyz 4. Open the email 5. Read the email. This sounds so fucking pathetic but it has helped in getting me started with some stuff. I still have to fight perfectionism bc sometimes I feel I can’t even start doing those things without finishing the whole list. So I just write the step

1. Open google chrome 
Then do it

Write the next step
2. Open email
Then do it

Anyways this might sound so fucking pathetic but I’m just discouraged because I feel like I’m trying so hard. And maybe some might feel like I’m not trying enough, but if it’s not adhd idk what to do. If it’s terrible anxiety that’s making me do this, I don’t even have the funds to pay for therapy to help with finding tools to help me navigate this.

I’m going to get a diagnosis today thankfully my mom is helping me pay for it. I was also thinking for autism but I don’t think I have it idk. I’m so frustrated with where I am as an adult but how do I know if it’s not going to be misdiagnosed as a woman? Or maybe my therapist is right it’s just anxiety.

How can I be certain? Sorry for like the mini trauma dump I guess I’m just tired of struggling.",1,1744346832.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1jwhtrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1jwhtrh/adhd_misdiagnosis_in_women_how_can_i_be_certain/,ADHD Misdiagnosis in Women: How Can I Be Certain?,"So I’ve heard adhd or autism for women go under-diagnosed or is misdiagnosed often bc historically it’s looked different on women than in men (I’m not sure I just heard can’t quote a study on it) and I think I’m curious about that bc I’ve been struggling with work for my part time that’s remote. Something that might take someone 2 hours to do might take me the whole day. So I’ve struggled in finding other work in addition to my part time simply because I’m not like completing tasks fast enough for my current part time and it’s not bc I don’t understand the work, but it’s because 

1. I’ll fall asleep when I get bored. 

I get 8-10hrs every night and even then I will fall asleep. I’ll move to coffee shops work with a friend and I still struggle and I’ll take naps even in the shops sometimes. 

2. It’s not that I can’t stay awake bc I’m tired but I literally can’t get myself to do the work bc it’s not interesting enough. I can definitely focus and stay awake for things that are more um idk stimulating to me?

I’ll be cleaning or maybe researching about topics I like and read about those things. Talk to AI about existential things (I’ve always thought about these things even as a teenager it’s not like I’m going through an existential crisis rn although maybe I am but I mean I naturally always think about topics related to this) or things I’m curious about (anthropology, history, religion/philosophy, etc). So everyday I’m going online surfing with the topics that naturally interest me more. So there is evidence I can focus. 

3. I’ve deleted social media and try to limit other obvious distractions but even like opening my email or tabs and for things I need to do work also like distract me. 

Or might overwhelm me, but I might have a task to like check an email but like something else will come to mind because of looking at ads that come up or seeing other emails that remind me to respond to other people unrelated to the work I’m supposed to be finishing. Anyways then I’m like oh wait what was it that I was supposed to be doing? I am known to go on tangents when talking and also never answering questions directly because of unnecessary context I give before realizing I didn’t answer the question and have to recall what was asked. The same way goes for how I approach doing tasks in work.  

4. I struggle with perfectionism  and I have had a history of anxiety my whole life due to trauma and me sucking rn in my work habits is taking a toll on my self esteem and making me start to question my competence, so idk if it’s bc I might have adhd or bc I’m worried all the time that it’s affecting my focus.

I was in therapy for sometime but had to stop because I couldn’t afford it but she felt I didn’t have adhd and more chronic anxiety that affected what I did that ended up with me being in a vicious cycle. 

Ex: anxious all the time bc of survival —> affects my focus in work —> take longer to finish so I can’t find other source of income to live no just survive  —> get paid to just survive so no incentive to wake up since I can’t do what I love —> depressed and oversleeping —> cycle repeats

(Be Kind to Ex-Ambots),"Amway, and other MLMs, can leave VERY broken people in their wake. They're financially damaged - sometimes bankrupt, emotionally devastated, bitterly disappointed and often ashamed and guilt-ridden because they exploited family members, friends and coworkers in their zeal to create a downline.

Some ex-Ambots have needed years of intensive therapy in order to deprogram themselves and recover from the mental and emotional wreckage. 

Remember that your friends and family are literally leaving a cult. Be supportive and kind. Try not to say ""I told you so,"" even though, and especially if, you did. 

Your ex-Ambot may be dealing with financial destruction that can take years to repair.

They've lost friends, the cultists they thought were friends now treat them with derision and contempt, and may have alienated family members. Amway has destroyed marriages. 

Children may have suffered parental alienation, emotional neglect or even abuse. 

They've left a cult and their brain chemistry may be altered. Trauma can last for years.

**A Therapist’s Guide to Supporting People Exiting MLMs**

“How would you like to pursue entrepreneurship?”

""Enter my contest for a FREE pamper session!”

“Hey girl, what's your current skincare routine? I just tried this product...”

If the above phrases just triggered the hairs on the back of your neck, you’re probably well-versed in the world of multi-level marketing, or MLMs.

As a quick aside to those unfamiliar, MLMs are those businesses that your aunt, your coworker, and your high school friend have been suspiciously present in your DMs about. Think LuLaRoe, Mary Kay, or Young Living. These businesses involve the sale of a product or service where the salesforce is incentivized to recruit, as they in turn earn money on recruits' sales. Most MLMers are female (around 60%), though groups such as Primerica and Herbalife seem to have plenty of men involved.

The problem with most of these companies is that, reportedly, less than 1% of MLM participants actually profit from these endeavors, with the majority of earnings coming in for early adopters and those at the top. Recruiters will go through great lengths to make promises to those who join their team, only to become dismissive of those who renege. For many, this results in not only financial loss, but community loss when they finally do decide to make their exit.

While my own experience with MLMs is limited, I have countless friends and family members who have been harmed by groups like these, both financially and emotionally. As both an accountant and a therapist, my unique skill set has primed me for a special interest in these omnipresent but often harmful companies. My goal is never to judge those who become involved in MLMs. Rather, I want all of us to be empowered to help exiters heal, grow, and find alternatives for self-sustenance and/or community care.

Here are some of my ideas for helping these exiters (or almost-exiters) below, based on personal experience and speaking to folks who’ve been in MLMs previously.

Avoid the “I told you so”s 

Honestly, nobody you will ever meet hates hearing “I tOlD yOu So!!!1” more than I do, so I would recommend this regardless of the situation. Those who are in the midst of leaving an MLM are often especially vulnerable, and this language amounts kicking them while they’re down. Listen: they already know they didn’t make the greatest decision. Even if they’re thinking of joining a different MLM and you’re worried, stick to the facts—income disclosures are your friend here—and avoid admonishment.

Offer household or job-related help

A person leaving an MLM may be in dire financial straits, or at least be in the market for an actually-sustainable job now that the MLM is no longer going to take as much of their time. Offering house help, babysitting, or even resume reviewing to someone who is in their MLM leaving journey can make a world of difference. Who knows, you may even be able to offer them a job!

Invite them out

It’s not uncommon for MLM exiters to become isolated from their support circle while becoming invested in their MLM, especially when such groups have frequent “coaching calls” or encourage the MLMer to spend their free time marketing and recruiting. Additionally, many MLMers lose friendships or mar family relationships during their recruitment attempts, so a person leaving may be struggling to figure out how to have their “old life” back. Inviting an MLM exiter to lunch or to your next game night might make an enormous difference in reminding them that they do indeed have community outside of the MLM.

A caveat here: if you feel wronged or otherwise negatively affected by the exiter’s MLM involvement, you are by no means obligated to take this step. However, if you desire mutual understanding or relationship restoration with the person, a one-on-one phone call or coffee with them might be a good next step for repair.

Above all, encourage autonomy

The hardest part about all of this is the basic understanding that, as adults, we are all autonomous humans who are responsible for our own decisions. This means that nobody, and I mean nobody, can make someone leave or stay out of an MLM. Leaving is a decision that has to be made by the exiter, and attempts to scold someone out of joining or into leaving are usually disastrous.

So if you make your most valiant efforts to convince your friend to stay clear of MLMs and their ilk, but they still continue to join them, that is not your responsibility. Your only responsibility is to be respectful and set boundaries for your relationship.

Anyway, the one last thing I’ll mention here is somewhat of a shameless plug: I wrote my graduate thesis on the harms of MLMs. I used many of the same sources I used for that paper here, so if the links to anything no longer work, please do let me know. As a bonus, the anime Überdorks among us may notice that I gave all of my research participants pseudonyms from HunterXHunter. 

Let me know if you have any additional thoughts on this subject in the comments below. And as always, be well and care for yourself. Always remember that you deserve it—even if you’re one of the people who tried to invite me to a Pure Romance party back in the day.

1jwhssq,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jwhssq/could_my_vyvanse_be_making_me_more_physically/,Could my Vyvanse be making me more physically reactive to stress?,"I am fairly new to Vyvanse. Adderall gave me full blown panic attacks for hours, and Strattera made me feel like I was having a heart attack every time. The Vyvanse gave me some jitters at first, but I started eating a little bit of breakfast and stopped drinking coffee, which essentially took care of that issue. I got moved up from 10 to 20mg a couple weeks ago and the first few days were great. I wasn't constantly groggy like I was pre Vyvanse and I could filter through my thoughts to just focus on one, rather than being bombarded by all of them at once. It was also easier for me to just get up and start things instead of just sitting around and dreading it for hours. 

The problem is that I had a fairly stressful morning on Sunday. Long story short, I didn't eat because I was too preoccupied with something and it made me feel nauseous and jittery. I ended up eating my first (and only) meal at dinnertime and continued to feel on edge the rest of the day. I didn't feel great on Monday so I just napped all day and didn't take my meds. Tuesday through Thursday (today), I ate a little and took my meds. Unfortunately I experienced the physical symptoms of really bad anxiety like chest tightness, something stuck in my throat, stomach discomfort, and nausea ALL DAY. I did experience some external stress each of these days, but it wasn't anything that I couldn't handle. In fact, I mentally handled the external stresses probably more efficiently than before. The problem was just the physical discomfort. I couldn't stop thinking about how uncomfortable I was, which I think only made it worse. It wasn't anywhere near as bad as my experiences with Adderall and Strattera, but I was constantly paranoid that it would evolve into that. I feel like the last few days have made the ideal of taking my Vyvanse tomorrow so off-putting, which I'm sure won't help make it any better. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I'm sad because I felt like it was so helpful before. ",1,1744346651.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

My doctor has me on 40 mg of omeprazole and did a dilation during the endoscopy. 

It seems like ever since getting this diagnosis, I’ve had quite a few symptoms-a constant feeling of phlegm in my throat and post nasal drip, random heartburn and acid reflux. I have cut out all gluten and dairy even though my doctor was pretty pessimistic about doing an elimination diet. I had never noticed a reaction to gluten and dairy but I tried having gluten after a couple of weeks of not eating it and it caused major heartburn. I’ve also recently started to feel my throat get really tight after drinking coffee which has never happened before. The doctor I saw today for my follow up wants me to come back next month for another biopsy and dilation. He was freaking me out pretty bad when talking about the possible risks of dilation to the point where I’m seeking a second opinion.

So i consider myself pretty Australian. But when i see discussion online about immigrants not “assimilating” and our culture changing i am curious as to what these people mean. As presumably at least some of them are not just using it as a dog whistle.

When i think of Australian culture i think of:
 - Being very multicultural.
 - being a bit rough , uncouth and straightforward, but more in a relaxed way, not mean.
 - Being pro unionised labour - since that was such a pivotal part of our federation and early politics.
 - Being quiet achievers. I wouldn’t call it tall poppy but definitely not liking bragging
 - Enjoying stability and not embracing big changes to the status quo
- being a bit cheeky and irreverent
- i would also consider indigenous australian culture and history as something deeply unique to us. We seem to be worse than our neighbours in NZ at embracing our indigenous culture.
- being a bit picky about coffee
- shortening words 
- disliking shoes in public

I think in the past i would of included a strong music and arts scene - but a history of poor government investment seems to be seeing this fade away.

Those are all of the things i can think of that really feel somewhat unique to Australia. I view us as a uniquely dynamic culture. That is not set in stone and is always changing. Which i love. The culture i grew up with probably wont exist the same way when im 60. Which doesn’t worry me. I look forward to trying to embrace whatever exists at the time.

I often see “mateship”, banding together in crisis, a strong alcohol culture and “dole bludgers” but these are things that you find in basically any country. So i dont consider those uniquely part of our culture.

Countries i have visited in SE Asia have a much more defined culture than we do. I think this is partly as a lot of it comes from a strong religious history. Being much older as countries, or having massive cultural movements that have been embraced by the country - e.g. the prevalence of ho chi minh throughout Vietnam. I don’t think this is the correct way or that there is a correct way to do culture. Just an observation 

What are your thoughts? I dont want this to devolve into saying our culture shouldn’t change or change is bad. Directing hate at specific groups or lamenting the days of old. I would like to hear some genuine (positive?) opinions  on what “being australian” means to you

I was diagnosed with a genetic type 2 diabetes in 2010, it’s been 15 years, & yet the condition in my body is getting worse & I’m so exasperated by it.

For reference I’m chronically disabled (hEDS which is genetic, Fibro & many commodities in relation to these conditions, irrelevant to weight), & I am unable to exercise much, especially as I also have agoraphobia & I am unable to leave the house. My exercise comes in the form of doing housework - when able, or day to day chores to keep my head afloat.

One of my conditions means I have a lot of gastrointestinal issues, & I was recently diagnosed with functional dyspepsia. I am unable to absorb certain high fibre foods, such as wholemeal / wholewheat bread / pasta, certain vegetables etc - all stuff that is low in glycemic index which, ordinarily would be perfect for this condition.

I’m now on insulin, but my sugars just aren’t budging. The constant high numbers petrify me, which feeds into my (diagnosed) eating disorder, then I start bingeing or avoiding foods completely.

The safe foods I knew I could eat that meant my sugars didn’t spike, I can no longer reach for because I become violently unwell (to the point even morphine doesn’t touch the pain).

My issue is finding foods that are easy when I’m in a pain flare. I do not have anyone to help, having lost 3 family members suddenly & unexpectedly from 22’-24’, so I’m trying to find my feet with everything again.
Can anyone here help advise me on easy, satiating meals please? Especially breakfasts? I only eat twice a day, breakfast & dinner, I just can’t seem to muster up an appetite during the day. I only ever drink water or dilute squash (flavour enhancer? To those not in the UK?) - all no added sugar when I do have some, which isn’t often. No tea, coffee, fizzy drinks or alcohol etc.

1jwhdds,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jwhdds/he_drowned_because_the_lights_went_out_now_hes/,He Drowned Because the Lights Went Out… Now He’s Back Every New Moon.,"**Have you ever had a job that just felt wrong?** Not just the kind of wrong where you drag yourself out of bed and mutter about your paycheck or your manager under your breath—but the kind of wrong that settles in your bones. The kind that makes your skin itch and your gut whisper, *“You shouldn’t be here.”* That’s my job.

I work alone as the lighthouse keeper at a place called Blackridge Point. You’ve probably never heard of it, and honestly, that’s for the best. It’s not on any popular maps. No tourists ever come close. Even locals pretend it’s not there. And you know what? They’re right to. Because something about Blackridge Point feels like it was never meant to be found—like the earth itself regrets making room for it.

Now, normally, a lighthouse is supposed to help ships—shine a light so they don’t crash into rocks or get lost at sea. That’s the idea I had when I accepted the position. I thought I’d be doing something good. Helpful. Maybe even noble. But here? At this lighthouse? The light doesn’t guide anything. It traps something. It holds it in. The beam isn’t a welcome—it’s a warning.

And tonight? Tonight’s not like the others.

Tonight, I found something I was never supposed to find.

I wasn’t even searching for anything unusual when I found it. It was just a routine night shift, one of the hundreds I’ve done in this cold, salt-bitten tower that groans with every gust of wind. You’d think after two years, I’d have seen it all. But this place… this place always holds something back, just long enough to make you think it’s safe.

That night, I had decided to clean the supply room. Just something to break the endless silence. The room was cluttered with old, forgotten things—cracked lanterns, rusted tools, thick manuals that hadn’t been opened in decades. It smelled like mold and old wood and something else… something sharp in the back of the throat.

I was moving a stack of unused logbooks when I saw it. A brittle sheet of yellowed paper, wedged between the back wall and a shelf support beam. I pulled it free. It crackled under my fingers. No title. No signature. Just seven rules, handwritten in a shaky scrawl that made it feel like the person writing it hadn’t slept in weeks.

And those rules? They didn’t feel like the kind of thing someone made up for fun. They felt… lived.

**“Lock the door at exactly 11:00 PM. If you hear knocking after that, do not open it. No one you want to see would be knocking.”**

That was the first line. Simple. But chilling.

**“The light must stay on. If it flickers, you must turn it back on immediately. Even if it means going outside.”**

My heart skipped. I had done that before. Gone outside when the power glitched in a storm. I thought it was normal. Necessary maintenance.

**“Avoid looking directly at the water after midnight. If you hear something calling your name, it is lying. If the water tries to talk to you, —shut your mouth and don’t answer.”**

My breath caught. I remembered the time I thought I heard someone yelling from the cliffs. I had almost shouted back.

**“If you see a man standing at the edge of the cliff, do not acknowledge him. Do not speak. Do not approach.”**

A cold sweat began to spread across my back. I *had* seen someone like that. Just once. A few weeks ago. I thought it was a trick of the light.

**“You must leave at exactly 4:00 AM. Not a minute before. Not a minute after.”**

I’d always left around 4, but never on the dot. Never knew it mattered. Maybe it does.

**“When the fog rolls in thick, do not look outside the window. You might see something you wish you hadn’t.”**

I thought about the nights when the fog came in so dense I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. I had stared out the window just to feel less alone.

**“Every new moon, the ship will return. Do not acknowledge it. Do not try to stop it. Do not watch.”**

That one hit me hardest. I hadn’t seen any ship. But the moon was a sliver tonight. A new moon was coming.

I stood there, staring at the list, my hands trembling slightly around the edges of the paper. It felt like the air around me thickened, like the room itself held its breath.

At first, I laughed. A weak, shaky laugh. Thought maybe it was just some old joke from a previous keeper. Some creepy tradition to mess with the new guy.

But the longer I held that paper, the more the silence seemed to lean in closer. Like the whole lighthouse was watching me.

And deep down, I realized something.

This wasn’t a warning left behind.

It was a dare.

A test.

And without knowing it, I’d already been following some of the rules.

I’d already been playing the game.

Whether I liked it or not.

I tried to distract myself. Really, I did. I paced around the main floor of the lighthouse. Picked up a dusty book from the side table, flipped through pages without seeing a word. I even turned on the little battery-powered radio, hoping to catch a fuzzy station from the mainland—but all I got was static. Through it all, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. They trembled like I’d been out in the cold too long, even though the thick stone walls of the lighthouse kept the wind out. It wasn’t the cold. It was fear—cold, quiet, creeping fear.

The first rule had seemed simple when I read it. **“Lock the door at exactly 11:00 PM.”** Easy, right? Just turn the key and walk away. So that’s what I did. I walked over to the heavy iron door, the one at the bottom of the spiral staircase, and I turned the lock. Once. Then again, just to be sure. The metal groaned in protest, like it didn’t want to be locked. That should’ve been my first clue.

And then—at exactly 11:03—I heard it. The knocking started.

**Knock.**

A pause.

**Knock.**

Another pause.

**Knock.**

Three slow, deliberate knocks. Then silence. The kind of silence that presses against your ears, waiting to see what you’ll do.

I froze where I stood, eyes wide. I hadn’t expected it to actually *happen*. I hadn’t even remembered hearing knocking before tonight. But now that I was really listening, really tuned in, it struck me—I *had* heard this before. Maybe not consciously, but deep in my brain, the sound had been there. Buried. Like a memory you pretend isn’t yours.

And that’s when it hit me: this had been happening *every single night*.

I just hadn’t noticed.

Or maybe—I hadn’t wanted to.

I took a step back from the door. The lighthouse was on a cliff. It’s not like someone could just wander up here. There’s a narrow trail that leads from the shore, and the rocks down below are sharp and unforgiving. You’d *hear* someone climbing that path. Their footsteps would echo.

But tonight? I hadn’t heard a thing. 

And then—

**“Hello?”** 

The voice hit me like a slap across the face. It was male. Low. A little rough, like someone who hadn’t used it in a while. But there was something… wrong. Like a song sung by someone who knows all the words but doesn’t understand the meaning. Too steady. Too careful.

**“I… I think I’m lost,”** the voice said.

I didn’t move. My jaw clenched tight enough to hurt. I stared at the door like it might reach out and grab me.

*Lost?* Out here? In the middle of nowhere? At night? It made no sense.

I don’t know how I knew, but I *knew*—that voice wasn’t right. It didn’t *belong*.

**“Please,”** it said again, softer this time, like it was trying to sound weak. **“I don’t have much time… you have to let me in.”**

I almost—*almost*—reached for the door. Something in me twitched. Reflex. Instinct. That old human habit of helping someone in need.

But then, my eyes flicked to the paper I’d tucked into my coat pocket.

**Rule #1: Do not open the door.**

My fingers tightened around the coat fabric. I stepped back.

The voice kept going, pleading, begging, insisting. Each word more convincing than the last. It tried to sound scared. Then kind. Then angry. But I kept still. Kept my mouth shut.

Then, without warning, the voice just… stopped.

Silence. Not even a breath.

And then, the footsteps.

But they weren’t the kind of footsteps that echoed on a stone path. No. These were different. No crunch of gravel. No rustle of brush. Just a soft, steady rhythm—like feet padding over empty air.

They didn’t head back down the trail.

They didn’t fade into the woods.

They simply… walked away. Into the pitch-black night that stretched beyond the lighthouse like an endless sea of nothing.

I didn’t breathe.

Then—something slid under the door. A soft, scraping sound like paper across stone.

I stared at the bottom of the door.

A piece of paper.

Bloodied.

Not just smudged—but *soaked* in dark, rust-colored blotches.

I hesitated. My fingers hovered near it, unsure. It could be a trick. It could be a trap. But leaving it there felt worse.

So, carefully, I picked it up. The edges were sticky. The smell—metallic, sharp, sickening.

I turned it over and slowly unfolded it.

There were words. Shaky, handwritten lines like the rules, but smaller, messier. I began to read.

But I didn’t get far.

Because the moment my eyes hit the second line—

**The lights flickered.**

Not a soft flicker. Not a gentle dim.

A hard stutter. On, off, *on*.

And for the first time that night…

I realized I wasn’t alone.

When I glanced at the clock, it read **12:00 AM** exactly.

Midnight.

The second my eyes registered the time, the lighthouse light—my only real protection against whatever nightmares Blackridge Point held—**flickered again**. A single, sharp blink. Then another.

Once.

Twice.

And then—**darkness**.

The beam that usually swept steadily over the black ocean just vanished. Gone. Just like that. No warning. No hum of dying power. Just... out. And in that instant, something deep inside me *knew* this wasn’t a simple malfunction. This wasn’t normal.

The second rule. I remembered it clearly now.

**""The light must stay on. If it flickers, you must turn it back on immediately. Even if it means going outside.""**

A cold jolt of panic ripped through my chest. My throat tightened. My heart started hammering so fast it felt like it might crack my ribs. I fumbled for the flashlight on the nearby table, snatched it up with shaking hands, and bolted for the staircase. The old spiral steps groaned beneath my feet as I raced up toward the lantern room.

The cold hit me halfway up.

Not normal cold. Not just sea air cold.

It was *wrong*.

By the time I reached the top, I could *see* my breath. Thick white clouds spilling from my mouth like smoke from a fire. My fingers were numb already, the metal railing burning my skin like ice.

And then—the light above me dimmed to a soft glow… and died.

Everything went black.

Total.

Utter.

Black.

I turned on my flashlight. The weak yellow beam cut through the room like a knife, shaking with every tremble of my hand. I swung it toward the generator, heart thudding in my ears louder than the wind outside.

I hit the main switch.

**Click.**

Nothing.

Not a spark. Not a hum. Nothing.

My breath caught in my throat. I moved toward the backup generator, hope clinging to me like a lifeline.

But something stopped me.

Not a noise.

Not a touch.

Just a *feeling*. That crawling, skin-tightening sense of being watched. Of something **out there**.

And then—from the corner of my eye—I saw it.

Something was standing outside.

Still. Unmoving. Just at the edge of the cliff, past where the light usually reached.

It wasn’t a person.

It looked like a person if you were squinting from far away and had never seen one before. It had the shape. The form. But something was *off*. It was too tall. Too thin. Its arms hung in a way that made my stomach twist. And where its face should’ve been—there was just a smear of shifting black. No eyes. No mouth. Just a suggestion of a head, swirling like smoke held in a jar.

It didn’t move.

It just stood there.

Watching.

**Watching me.**

Or maybe the lighthouse.

Either way, the message was clear.

The light was off.

And it was waiting.

I turned back toward the generator, my hands nearly useless from the cold. They slipped off the knobs once, twice, before I managed to grip the ignition switch. I glanced over my shoulder.

The shape had taken a step forward.

I panicked. Slammed my palm against the ignition.

**Come on. Come on. Come on—**

With a loud roar, the generator coughed, sputtered, and finally **roared to life**.

The light above me flared. It didn’t flicker—it *blazed*, shooting out through the foggy night like a sword made of fire. The whole room filled with a warm, blinding glow.

I turned, heart in my throat, and looked back toward the cliff.

Gone.

The figure was **gone**.

Not a trace. Not a footprint. Not a whisper in the wind.

Just the night.

And that cursed, endless sea.

**“What? What was that?”** I whispered to myself, as if saying it aloud would make it real. My heart thumped wildly in my chest, loud and uneven like a warning drum. My mind spun in circles, refusing to settle. Every second that passed made the silence around me feel heavier, like it was pressing down on my lungs. I tried to distract myself, moving clumsily from one half-done task to another — checking oil levels, adjusting the beams, wiping already clean surfaces — anything to keep my hands moving and my thoughts quiet. But no matter what I did, that sharp edge of unease only grew sharper.

People don’t take lighthouse jobs for fun. No one dreams about spending months isolated in a cold, creaking tower by the sea, cut off from the world. You don’t wake up one day and say, *“I want to be alone with nothing but foghorns and sea spray for company.”* No. You end up here because you're running. Hiding. Escaping.

**My reason?** It was simple. I had nothing left. Nothing to hold onto. Nothing to keep me in the world I once called home.

I grew up in a small, quiet town built on the edge of a reservation. The kind of place where stories floated in the wind and people still nodded at things unseen. My grandfather was a proud, wrinkled man who’d survived too much and said too little. He used to sit by the fire and tell us stories that sounded more like warnings than tales. He spoke of spirits that didn’t stay dead, voices that called from the water, and fog that carried more than just moisture. As a boy, I laughed it off. I thought it was just a part of our culture’s way of scaring kids into behaving.

But then... the crash.

My wife. My little boy. Gone. One rainy night and a slippery highway and just... nothing.

After that, everything my grandfather said started sounding less like myth and more like memory.

All I wanted was to disappear. To stop hearing the echo of toys that weren’t played with anymore. To stop seeing her mug in the cupboard and his boots by the door. I needed silence. Distance. Emptiness.

So when the job at Blackridge Lighthouse came up, I said yes without thinking twice. The pay was good, the expectations were low, and best of all, no one asked questions.

But now… now I was starting to wonder if I hadn’t chosen this place — if it had chosen me.

I tried to shake it off. Told myself I was just tired, that grief does weird things to the mind. I sat back down with my coffee, the cup trembling in my hand. Then, the old grandfather clock ticked past 12:30… and I heard it.

A voice.

**“Hello?”** I called out, more habit than hope. But the hairs on my arms stood up.

It was outside. By the water.

And it said my name.

Clear. Soft. Familiar.

My whole body stiffened. My mouth went dry.

Rule #3 of the Blackridge Keeper’s Manual: *Avoid looking directly at the water after midnight*

At first, I joked about the rules.

Laughed them off like some weird initiation prank, when I first got here. But I followed them. Always. Until now.

Because that voice… that voice wasn’t just any voice.

It was **my mother’s.**

And she’s been gone for ten years.

**“No, no, no…”** I whispered. But even as I said it, my legs began to move. Like they didn’t care what the rulebook said. Like they belonged to someone else.

I made my way to the small circular window, the one that gave me the perfect view of the sea. I didn’t even realize I was crying until the salt from my tears stung the corners of my mouth.

**“Come down here. Please. I need you.”**

That voice — it *was* her. The gentle way she used to call me when dinner was ready. The way she used to soothe me when I cried after nightmares.

My hands clenched the windowsill. My knees locked. My brain screamed *don’t*, but my heart whispered *what if?*

Then, I saw it.

The water wasn’t calm. It was moving, twitching almost, like it was panicking.

Something wasn’t coming *through* the water.

Something was pushing the water away.

It churned, spun, and pulled back in slow, hesitant waves, as if it wanted nothing to do with what was rising from below.

I couldn’t breathe.

Because it began to take shape.

Not a man. Not a woman. Not any creature I’d ever seen or read about.

But a shape. Living. Wrong. Impossible.

It didn’t belong in this world.

**“No. No, what the hell is that…”** I whispered, my voice cracking.

And for the first time in my life, I realized that water — the very thing we need to live, the thing that brings life and peace and calm — could be horrifying.

**Oh my God. Oh my damn God.**

My survival instincts kicked in, sharp and fast. My eyes slammed shut without permission.

And then, the sound.

A scrape.

Right against the window.

Slow. Scratching.

Like fingernails.

One. By. One.

I froze. I didn’t breathe. The only thing I heard was the pounding of blood in my ears.

Then — silence.

No voice. No whispers.

When I dared to open my eyes, the window was fogged with thick condensation.

And written across the glass, as clear as daylight:

**DON’T BREAK THE RULES.**

By now, I was a wreck — completely drained, inside and out. My nerves felt like frayed wires sparking with every sound. My fingers wouldn’t stop trembling, even when I clenched them into fists. My chest was tight, like something heavy had settled inside it and refused to move. I kept telling myself that if I could just make it to morning, things would be okay. Maybe it would all seem like a dream. A horrible, twisted dream. I just had to hold on. But my body didn’t believe my thoughts anymore. I was tired. And scared in a way I hadn’t known a person could be scared.

I don’t even remember how the hours slipped away after that thing at the window. One moment, it was just after midnight. Then it was nearly four. My mind had stopped keeping track of time — like it knew it didn’t want to be awake for what came next.

At **3:45**, the world changed again.

It started with a smell — wet and heavy, like rotting seaweed and damp rope. Then, the fog came in. Thick. Too thick. It rolled in like it had a mind of its own, curling around the lighthouse in heavy blankets, choking the light. I could barely see the edge of my own desk. It was the kind of fog that didn’t just block sight — it swallowed sound too. Everything became muffled. Still.

I tried to keep my eyes down. I really did. I stared at the floor, blinked fast, focused on the beat of my heart. But then… I heard it.

**Creeeeak.**

Wood. Old, splintering wood under pressure.

Then another sound — metallic, low and dull.

**Clang. Clang.**

It rang out in the distance like a bell being swayed by an unseen hand.

A ship’s bell.

I stopped breathing.

Carefully, like a child hiding under the covers, I turned my head just enough to look through the window again. The fog was so thick, I thought I’d see nothing. But then, faintly, like a memory rising from deep sleep… I saw it.

A ship.

Barely visible. Like a shadow in the mist.

It glided across the surface of the ocean — too smooth, too quiet. No splashing. No waves around its hull. It didn’t disturb the water at all. It was just… moving. Silently. As if it wasn’t part of the world we know.

Its sails were torn, flapping gently like old fabric left to rot. The wood of the ship was cracked, discolored, and yet it held together as if stubbornly refusing to sink. It was wrong. This ship didn’t belong to this time — maybe not to any time.

And then I saw the **figures**.

They stood along the deck. Still. Watching.

They were shaped like people… but not truly people anymore.

Some of them were missing arms. One had no face at all — just smooth, pale skin stretched over where features should be. A few stood with mouths open, wide and empty, their jaws slack in endless screams. But none of them made a sound. They just **stared**. Every single one of them… facing the lighthouse.

Facing me.

I froze, unable to tear my eyes away. My skin crawled. My legs locked up. I couldn’t run, couldn’t even blink.

Then, one of the figures **moved**.

It raised its hand.

Not in greeting. Not in peace.

**It pointed.**

Right at me.

I felt like throwing up. My stomach twisted in on itself. My mind screamed for an explanation, but deep down — somewhere I didn’t want to look — I already knew.

This wasn’t some forgotten ghost story passed down from drunken sailors.

This was real.

All of it.

The rules. The whispers. The scratching on the window. The voice that sounded like my mother.

**The ship.**

It wasn’t just floating through the mist for no reason.

It was **coming back. Again. And again. And again.**

And now I understood why.

The bloodied paper I’d found earlier this night — crumpled and stuffed behind the logs — it had told the truth. I hadn’t understood it before. I hadn’t wanted to.

But now it made perfect, terrible sense.

The last keeper — he had made one mistake. Just one.

He had let the lighthouse go dark, even if only for a minute. And in that minute, the sea took what it wanted. The ship had crashed. Lives were lost. Or maybe something worse than lives.

Now, every new moon, the ship returned. Searching. Yearning. Not for answers.

**For vengeance.**

And if it couldn’t find him — the one who had failed — it would take **whoever** had replaced him.

Me.

My legs gave out, but I caught myself on the desk. I turned away from the window. I didn’t want to see it vanish. I didn’t want to watch those lifeless faces melt into the fog.

But I knew it had disappeared.

Back into the sea.

For now.

And something inside me whispered the truth I didn’t want to say out loud:

**It would come back.**

And next time… it might not leave empty-handed.

I didn’t let myself breathe again until my boots touched the damp stone just outside the lighthouse at exactly 4:00 AM. The moment I stepped into the open air, my lungs filled with a sharp, cold breath that hit me like a slap. The sky had begun to change — not quite light, not yet morning — just that eerie shade of gray that makes everything feel uncertain. The mist still clung to everything, not as thick as before, but heavy enough that the world still felt muffled and far away. Like the fog didn’t want to let go of the night. Like it wanted to hold me there a little longer.

I turned around slowly. Behind me, the lighthouse stood tall and silent. The golden beam of its rotating light sliced clean through the mist, like a sword fighting back the darkness. It was steady. Reliable. A symbol of safety for anyone out at sea. But for me?

It didn’t feel like safety anymore.

It felt like **a warning**.

I had done what I was told. I hadn’t broken any rules. I’d kept the light going, kept my eyes mostly where they should be, kept myself from listening too closely to voices I shouldn’t have heard. I had **survived** the night.

But at what cost?

And for how long could I keep doing this?

I stood there, staring at the rotating light, as if it could give me answers. I had spent the last two years telling myself this place was peace. Telling myself I had found **escape** in the silence, in the isolation. I told myself that I had run here to find quiet after my life had been ripped apart.

But what if that was never the truth?

What if I hadn’t come here to escape anything?

What if I had been **called** here?

The idea slithered into my mind, slow and sickening. What if I wasn’t just hiding from pain… but being **punished** by it?

Maybe this wasn’t a job. Maybe it was **a sentence**.

Maybe Blackridge didn’t offer solitude. Maybe it offered a cage made of fog and regret — a place where men were **sent** to feel every mistake echo forever in the sea.

And suddenly, something became painfully clear:

No matter how closely I followed the rules…

No matter how loyal I stayed to the routine, how sharp I kept the light, how silent I kept my thoughts…

**One day**, the lighthouse **wouldn't** protect me.

One day, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave.",1,1744345064.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False
