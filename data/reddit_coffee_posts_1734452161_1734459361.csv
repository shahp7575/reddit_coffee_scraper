# Back story

I was an inconsistent but decent runner in my youth with endurance sport genetics generally on my side (I have family members going back a couple generations who were at some point elite in their sport).[ I spent time in a cult, (if you're curious, I posted a little bit about it a couple years ago) and moved out young to escape it](https://www.reddit.com/r/FundieSnarkUncensored/comments/141oytf/it_cant_be_that_bad_you_turned_out_okay/). I was naive and completely unprepared for life. 

During and after college, I put on a lot of weight (up to roughly 215lbs, which is a lot for my 5-10 frame) and spent the majority of my 20s in a fairly unhealthy lifestyle fueled by workaholic tendencies, long hours, and cocaine. 

In December of 2021, during the fallout of a divorce from my college sweetheart, I was managing a cyber incident for my day job as an outsourced IC - conveniently buried in 80-100 hour weeks. Coupled with chronic stimulant abuse, it culminated in a tachycardia episode that caused me to lose consciousness, landed me both a traumatized girlfriend and an ambulance ride, and a hard look in the mirror. 

I had a 4-year-old daughter. She deserved better. So did my girlfriend, an absolute gem of a person, who had recently moved in with me. I laid in a hospital bed, a self-induced victim of my own selfishness, absorbing dirty looks from overworked medical professionals still reeling from the throes of COVID. I made the decision that I had to be better.

A lot of people intend to change. In my life few ever had. I barely believed it was possible. But I was going to be the outlier. 

I walked away from my job entirely. Fortunately, the cyber incident I was managing elevated my career to a level that allowed me to take a fairly cushy consulting gig, where I still work today. I stopped doing cocaine completely. I can count on my hands how many times I've drank alcohol in the years since. 

To be the best version of me, I needed to start by losing some of the weight I'd put on. So, I did.

I was down to mid 190s when I proposed to my girlfriend. By the time I got remarried, I was 185. As I welcomed my second born, my son, in July of 2023, now 31 years old, I weighed 175 and could see my abs for the first time since I was 19. 

Finally at a weight I could really train from, I started running seriously again at the start of 2023. Life was good. And then the hits kept coming.

Shortly after the birth of my son and a very medically challenging pregnancy, my wife developed acute postpartum psychosis. It gradually got worse until it didn't feel safe to leave her with the kids alone. My son is still unable to sleep through the night - in fact, rarely more than 2-3 hour stretches at any point. Exhausted beyond words, well beyond my capacity in medical debt, in a contentious but joint custody arrangement with my daughter (a now 7-year-old child with autism), and the sole breadwinner for my family, my body was wearing down in a way that seemed familiar.

I hadn't run a marathon since 2019, but I needed an ambitious goal. I needed something to keep me going. Cocaine wasn't an option. Running was.

Nevertheless, my body wasn't ready. In late 2023, I suffered a lower leg injury. Then this past July, another. By the end of this past summer, I was in decent shape but had failed twice to complete a full training cycle without injury. When I was healthy enough to try again, I set my sights on Dallas 2024.

BQ (2:55). It was a ridiculous goal, but I was physically capable. I've run marathons before - I needed a *challenge*.

# Training

I put together my own training plan using RW's sub-3-hour plan as a baseline template. I have superficially reconnected with my dad who is a high school cross country coach, and who, at least during the Carter administration, was a prolific collegiate steeplechaser. If nothing else at all, running has given us something to talk about, which through all the mixed feelings, is something I am thankful for. 

The first weeks went mostly fine. I was sore from the increase in miles, but nothing I couldn't manage. Originally, I had planned to cut another 10 lbs during the cycle for a race weight of 165, which has always been my preference. I knew early on that was a terrible idea. There's a fine line between hurt and injured - by a month in, I was straddling it.

I ran a 5k in early September. So sore I needed a two-mile warmup to move my legs, I finished barely under 20 minutes (19:47). Oof, not boding well. 

I recognized the sleep deprivation was not going to allow me to train traditionally. I was going to have to either reduce miles or cut speed training almost entirely. I opted for the latter, and it was a good decision.

Aside from a brief hiccup in mid-September when my wife's episodes got too bad to leave at all, I was generally in a solid route leaving the house around 5am to complete my runs before the family woke up. My body started responding well, and I was running 50-56 miles per week, despite rarely more than 4 hours of sleep per day.

Mentally, though, I was struggling. [I posted here to vent about the ""pits of training hell""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1fxko5k/advice_for_the_pits_of_training_hell/) after one particularly grueling long run that had my will to live just about zapped. I didn't want to let go of my goal, but the comments were giving me the first honest conversation with myself about whether or not this was becoming an unhealthy obsession. I wondered, truthfully, if I was replacing one stress-induced addiction with another. 

In October, I ran the Day of the Dead Half Marathon in Ft Worth to get a feel for race pace. I finished 1:27:54, without what felt like a particularly hard effort. I thought, at this point, I was in business. I've run marathons before and I don't need to be reminded that it's a lot more than two halves, but the somewhat easy effort at the pace I intended to compete at in December was a huge wind in my sails. 

I cruised through the next month until Thanksgiving Day. I ran for the first time in 16 years with my dad for the Turkey Trot in the town he lives in now. I was feeling pretty under the weather, but my 18:46 at 80-90% effort was right around where I thought I should be.

Unfortunately, it was the start of a reparatory bug, and my entire cycle and taper consisted of just two more easy runs over the next couple weeks.

Was I ready? It was a long shot, especially with how things had ended. But my legs were fresh, I was as determined as I could be, albeit with a slightly healthier outlook on the very real possibility that I was going to completely blow up. 

# Pre-race

I connected with a friend who was going to run the half marathon and went to the expo on Saturday together. It was a fun enough time - I sat for an IV, aware that it was 90% placebo, but also a bit more dehydrated than I'd want to be the day before a race.

Then I made the fateful mistake that would change everything. I bought a pork and chicken rice bowl. 

If I had only known.

I woke up at 4:45am on race day with a growling stomach. I forced down some granola and milk. This will pass, I told myself.

I grabbed a couple Imodium on my way to the subway. I didn't want to take them, but if things weren't looking better in a couple hours, it was my emergency plan.

I drank some coffee. My bowels kept churning. Nausea was starting to set in. I had a small BM and it did not look good.

With an hour until race time, I took the Imodium. FUCK. We didn't do all this to pull out now. If I was going to go down, I was going to go down shitting.

# Race

Waiting in the middle of corral A, I was randomly overcome with emotion as the clock ticked down. I'm not entirely sure what prompted it, but I lowered my sunglasses to hide the tears. It had been a long, grueling, lonely and isolating journey. I wasn't even thinking about my digestive distress at this point - I was just soaking in the moment.

I was far from a perfected human, but I was really proud of myself in that moment. The marathon was just a race, but it represented a lot more to me. It was the tangible proof of my growth as a person.

As the gun sounded, I found myself wishing I had started a little further to the front. There was a wide range of paces in the corral, and I expended a lot of energy just getting into some open space. When all was said and done, my Apple Watch Ultra had me running .3 miles over distance, all of which was in the first two miles.

Dallas is not known as a particularly hilly city, but between the Trinity River corridor and White Rock Lake, I'll be damned if the marathon doesn't find a way to showcase the terrain in whatever way it can. It is a surprisingly difficult course, but one I was familiar with from my last race here.

I knew my goals were very likely not going to materialize. If nothing else, the thought of getting down gels was horrifying and I've been known to bonk pretty hard without them. My strategy was to go out at goal pace, feel it out for a couple miles, slow about 10 seconds off pace, and if by some miracle I was in a good place when I got to the loop at the lake, I'd go all out for a positive split and sneak in under 3 hours.

I forced down my first gel at 5k as the crowd finally started to thin a bit. Within minutes, I knew it was going to be a long morning.

I searched for a porta potty through the 6th mile and found one in the 7th. I tried to be fast and resumed a steady pace when I was done. ""I can still make up for this if I get it out of my system now,"" I thought.

Nope. As the half marathoners split and we started our loop at the lake, I was finding another place to stop. This time, it took me almost two minutes to get in and out.

In a weird kind of way, it was a freeing moment. With a grunt, an explosion of biological warfare below me, and a weak admission that I was absolutely miserable, I was finally able to let go of my goal. ""Just finish. Do the best with what you've got.""

I tried to think of it like a long run, but I knew a bonk was coming. I was completely devoid of any liquid, and it was clear nothing was going to stay down. I would stop 6 more times for varying lengths of time to expel whatever my body thought was still inside. 

The bonk I knew was on its way arrived as we climbed out of the lake. I was weirdly surprised by how it was so much less miserable than what I was feeling in my innards, but it was enough to get me walk-jogging for a bit.

Around me, people were blowing up everywhere. I should mention, by this time it had started to rain. The wet conditions had already made for a challenging race all morning, and I was mortified at how little traction I was getting in my Saucony Endorphin Pros.

I felt my left hamstring tighten with about a mile to go, as we cruised through downtown. As I slowed to a brief stop, I saw the 3:45 pacing group go by. I chuckled to myself - I was nearly an hour off my pace but somehow, I felt like a warrior.

I rounded the final bend, crossed the finish, let out a guttural yell and a fist pump Tiger Woods would've been proud of. I expected to be devastated with this outcome, but I'm not. 

In some ways, I'm not sure I would've known what to do with myself if I had achieved what I set out for. Now, I still have something to work toward.

# Post-race

I was pleasantly surprised that my wife managed to make it to the finish, with my 1-year-old, despite the rain. It meant an awful lot to me that she cared, because for a long time it felt like she resented my running. She liked what it did for me, and indirectly for her, but it always felt like a sore subject. It meant a lot to see her there.

Nevertheless, I was straight up not having a good time at this point. I spent about 20 minutes in the porta potties after I finished and sat on the ground. My wife gave me a prescription anti-nausea pill and I sat with a friend while we watched the Cowboys game on the big screen at the post-race party.

My body locked up from dehydration to the point where I could barely move my lower half at all, but I eventually limped my way back to the train, took a short bath, and passed out next to my napping son. 

It's been a bit over 48 hours and I'm still really struggling to move around, but I am keeping fluids down, I have been able to eat again, and I'm slowly on the mend.

I'm signing up for the Tunnel Marathon in June (don't hate the player, hate the game). We're gonna try to knock a damn hour off this time over the next 7 months.

And maybe, while we're at it, we'll avoid eating mystery meat at the expo.

1hggifd,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hggifd/i_got_blocked_and_i_deserve_it/,I got blocked and I deserve it,"This is more of a vent post to get this off my chest. I know I fucked up and I am not seeking validation on any of my actions.

2 weeks ago I went on a date with a guy that initially showed immense interest in me. The more I got to know him (texts, calls, FaceTime) the more I started to fall for him. We went on our date and it was great for the most part. We grabbed dinner, coffee, and went to a nice view and made out and had a moment. But on the way back to drop him off we did have a conversation which revealed differences in our values and views in life. He was the adult and respectfully point it out saying we are incompatible and that he wanted to only be friends.

However the communication stopped from his end and it was mainly me reaching out to him.
One night he got tipsy and reached out  late at night asking what I was up to which gave me some sense of hope we could still make it work, but then once he sobered up he said we should only be friends. 

Fast forward to last night, my obsession for him took over and I went unannounced to his place. I told him I was outside and he responded saying he was uncomfortable and told me to never contact him again. He said he was seeing someone else and to leave him alone.

In that moment I had a sudden realization of the creep that I was being and felt so horrible. I left, apologized through text and deleted his number/chats/calls so I wouldn’t get tempted to reach out again. He blocked me on IG so we have officially cut off all our connection.

I know this post sounds pointless and probably just shows my mental instability, but I am truly sorry for what I put this guy through. I wish him the best in life and hope he finds his happiness because he truly was a great guy, and I couldn’t handle being just friends with him. As for myself, I am seeking  professional mental help because I do not want to put anyone else through this again should I ever catch feelings/obsession and get rejected.

1hgghij,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1hgghij/psychotherapy_for_bpd_part_three/,Psychotherapy for BPD : PART THREE," **BEHAVIOURAL TECHNIQUES**


- **Exposure therapy:**

This technique involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared situations or objects, helping them develop tolerance and reduce avoidance behaviour patterns.

Let's say a client with BPD is afraid of social situations due to a history of rejection and abandonment. The therapist might create a hierarchy of feared social situations, from least to most distressing, to guide the client's exposure practice.

For example, the hierarchy might look like this:
a) Sitting in a coffee shop alone
b) Approaching a stranger and asking a question
c) Initiating a conversation with a familiar acquaintance
d) Attending a social gathering with multiple strangers

After the therapist and client have created the hierarchy, the exposure therapy would begin. The client would start with the least feared situation (sitting in a coffee shop alone) and gradually move through each level of the hierarchy, facing their fears and tolerating the associated distress.

With each exposure, the client will be encouraged to stay in the situation as long as possible and use skills taught in therapy to manage their anxiety and discomfort. The therapist will offer guidance, reassurance, and techniques to help the client cope.


- **Skills training:** 

This technique focuses on teaching the individual skills to regulate their emotions, improve their communication, and manage their behaviours. This can include skills like emotion regulation, problem-solving, and interpersonal effectiveness.

Here are some examples of skill training techniques:

1. **Emotion regulation:** Teaching the client techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or grounding exercises to help reduce emotional intensity when they are overwhelmed.
2. **Problem-solving:** Working with the client to identify a problem or issue, generate alternative solutions, and evaluate them for possible outcomes.
3. **Communication:** Helping the client learn clear and assertive communication skills, such as how to express their feelings and needs effectively while also considering the other person's perspective.
4. **Distress tolerance:** Helping the client learn how to tolerate distress, accept uncomfortable emotions without trying to avoid them.


- **Contingency management:**

This technique involves using positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviours and discourage maladaptive ones.


- **Functional analysis of behaviour:**

This technique involves identifying and understanding the functions or purposes of the client's negative behaviors (e.g., avoiding uncomfortable emotions, seeking attention, or controlling others).

 an example of functional analysis in the context of BPD:

Client: ""I often have angry outbursts and yell at my partner when I feel like they're not listening to me.”
Therapist: ""Let's do a functional analysis of this behavior. What happens before you have an outburst?""
Client: ""Usually, my partner and I are discussing something important, and I feel like my concerns are being dismissed or ignored.""
Therapist: ""So it seems like your outbursts might be a way of trying to get your partner's attention and emphasise the importance of your concerns. How can you achieve that healthily or let your partner know that’s how you feel?”

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements and electrolytes.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

We started texting on Discord, then after a random 2 month hiatus I messaged her on her birthday and from there we got back to talking. Over those few months and even during the hiatus I honestly couldn’t stop thinking about her. We clicked very quickly personality wise, and we share a good amount of morals. 

But we’re on 2 different halves of the country and we haven’t met up in person yet. I’ve told her that if we were actually to date (she’s basically implied she likes me because she would say “we need to get married” or “not until we get married” or even call me “bf” or hell even “husband” I found it a bit odd but wholesome at the same time. She even told me I was cute smart tall lol. I find her attractive and even told her (“you’re very nice”, etc) too but here’s the thing

Those nicknames.. she kept going with them no matter how many times I said we should meet up in person if anything first. Not saying she said it everyday but she did genuinely like me. Don’t get me wrong I’m flattered. But idk why she kept doing it even though I told her to relax on it.

One day last month I called her out on it and she said “nvm. Friend” then deleted the “husband” nickname. We haven’t spoken since and a part of me feels bad because heck even if we don’t date she was a great friend to talk to game with and share stories with.

Now.. much closer to me in person I’ve also met / know a few gals that I would be interested to date. There is one girl (22F) I took out for coffee and tbh even if she doesn’t reciprocate feelings, I’d be honored to have her for a good friend. (Though there was one time she touched me on my shoulders behind me when she came to say hi so idk if she’s just being flirty friendly or what) But I don’t know if I should go for one of these in person girls or should I try again with the online girl. 

I told my parents and they think I should forget the online girl, but I’m not one to cut off friends no matter what they do to me.

What do I do, folks? ",2,1734457840.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1hgg9dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1hgg9dr/it_must_have_been_love_christmas_for_the_broken/,It Must Have Been Love (Christmas for the broken hearted),"Share ko lang yung experience ko regarding sa recent ended relationship ko (M, late 20's).

Nakilala ko 'tong si ex (M,30+) sa isang site na nag offer ng escort service. I would say na until now hindi ko pa rin alam kung ano yung gusto ko sa buhay
at medyo late na nag explore about myself esp. my sexuality. I worked abroad (Singapore) after college kaya naging busy rin sa work life at pagiging breadwinner.
Nagkaroon na naman ako ng past rel. sa isang pero hindi din maganda ang breakup dahil cheating yung reason. Nasanay lang ako na maging single pero if may dumadating
hinayaan ko lang. May mga naging girlfriend din ako wayback sa college and dito din abroad. Pero after pandemic nag try ako mag explore at mag try sa guy.
Nag try ako mag tinder and bumble hanggang sa mag end up ako dito sa isang site kung saan nga ang purpose ay magoffer ng escort service.

While on vacation sa PH, Nag try ako ulit mag open sa website and nakita ko nga 'tong si guy. Sa lahat ng napag tanungan ko sa site ay siya yung pinaka-mabilis
mag reply kahit madaling araw na. Medyo mahal din yung 3 hours niya at nakalagay dun yung mga services na ma i-ooffer niya. Hindi naman ako expert at wala akong
idea sa mga ganito kaya hindi ko alam if ano yung normal rates doon. After niya mag reply pinabayaan ko lang at hindi na nag reply dahil medyo namahalan nga ako sa rate. While from time to time siguro once a week nag sesend siya ng mga messages ex. (“Hire mo na ko sir!” “Musta Sir?”). After my vacation, medyo home sick at literal na nagkasakit kaya sa bahay lang ako nag stay at WFH ng 1 week, madami time mag tiktok at biglang dumaan yung profile niya dahil contact ko siya. Naging interested ako sa kanya dahil sa mga travels niya at malakas ng dating niya sa pag porma na naka post sa Tiktok profile niya. Ibang-iba sa mga photos niya sa site.

Nag message ulit ako sa kanya kasi tinamaan na naman ng L. Hoping mag sesend siya ng nude pic or video. Nag offer ako mag send ng money kapalit pero hindi daw talaga siya nag sesend ng video or nude pic for privacy. Since nasa Singapore nga ako ay hindi kami makakapag meet agad. Nag send parin ako and I asked him to send other photos na wala sa site. He sent some of his travel photos kaya mas lalo pa akong naging interested kasi mahilig din ako mag travel. I clarified if walang magagalit kasi baka mamaya may ka relasyon pala. Sinabi niya na may asawa at anak daw siya and he’s doing it para maka earn ng money. Upon stalking his other social med wala naman kaya inisip ko na lang na sinabi niya yon para purely libog lang yung ma feel ng mga client niya.

Mas dumalas yung pag uusap namin na umabot na sa kamustahan, asking if kumain na or ano ginagawa. He would send photos while on gym, photos of his food and madami pang ibang photos na parang nag rereport na sa Jowa. I will be honest, na attach na ako sa kanya at gusto ko pa siya makilala. There’s something in me na nagsasabi na “push mo na to this time”, “what if ganito ganyan?”, “try mo lang”.

After a month of talking, Hindi of talking medyo naging comfortable na kami with each other, mas napadami ang kwento and all. Anong gusto gawin and madami pa. Sometimes he would tease me na “Yari ka sakin pag uwi mo”, “Matitikman mo rin ako”. Sometimes I would send him allowance pa para pang gala niya pero wala naman tong kapalit, happy lang ako na mabigyan siya ng pang dinner at gala. 

Hindi na ako nakatiis kaya nag leave ako for 1 week vacation pa-Pinas. Super excited ako kaya namili ako ng mga pasalubong for him. I bought him shoes, perfume, chocolates. Sabi ko lang sa sarili ko bahala na baka pag sisihan ko pa if hindi ko ginawa. Nag meet kami sa isang mall sa Makati kung saan malapit yung pinag stayan ko na hotel. Nag set ako ng dinner for 2 at doon kami nag meet. Super kabado kasi hindi naman ako nakikipag meet pa before isa isang guy in a proper dinner. Naging smooth naman yung dinner namin at masasabi ko na mas malakas yung dating niya sa personal. 2 nights kami nag meet at both nights ay mang nangyari samin. Iniisip ko noong una na after non ay mawawalan na ako ng gana pero hindi dahil mas lalo pa akong na attach. Madami kaming napag usapan. Inamin niya sakin na Single siya at walang asawa at kaya lang nasabi yon ay dahil sa security niya para sa ibang client. Sinabi niya rin sakin na gusto niya pa ko makilala. I asked if may bf/gf siya that time pero wala daw.

Bumalik na ako sa Singapore after ng short stay ko sa PH. Na miss ko siya and siya rin daw. Hindi ako nag eexpect pero gusto ko na siya after namin mag meet. Okay naman yung pag uusap namin pero na feel ko na kapag dadating yung weekend nagiging busy siya. Nag stalk ako sa FB, IG niya then may nakita akong isang guy na lagi niyang kasama even in his friends posts. Then I stalked din yung yung guy at may post din ng photo nilang dalawa. I asked him if sino yung guy and sabi niya ay naka date niya daw before pero tapos na. Ayaw ko naman kasi maging kontra bida if may jowa naman pala talaga siya. Days passed, and napapansin ko na busy talaga siya kapag dadating yung weekend and minsan di na lang mag rereply. Wala naman ako right kasi nga hindi naman kami kaya one time nag decide ako wag na mag message pero dami niyang message hanggang sa pauwi na ulit ako sa Pinas to attend a formal event. Nag book ako ng 3 days El Nido trip para saming dalawa. Sabi ko sa sarili ko, last na to kapag wala pang malinaw na sagot sa mga tanong ko meaning walang pag asa. Masaya naman yung naging trip. In a way naging malaya ako makapag express ng sarili ko. Dito din naramdaman ko na iba na yung pakiramdam since matagal din kaming magkausap lang. Sa airport, medyo may konting ilang pa pero while travelling from Puerto Princesa to El Nido na 5 hours more or less nakapag usap at kamustahan kami ng mahaba. Nag offer ako na punasan likod niya kasi sobrang init that time. Sabi niya lang ang sweet ko daw. Then akbayan kasi ayaw naman namin magpahalatang may something sa driver dahil ni rent ko yung van. Pag dating ng hotel, kiniss niya ko agad pero wala pang nangyari. Nag kiss kami before pero this time yung may feelings na. 2nd day yung nilinaw ko sa kanya about that guy na lagi niyang kasama medyo nagbago yung tone niya kasi pinapalaki ko daw yung issue dahil lang sa pag react niya ng heart sa post nung guy. Sabi ko wala naman ako right din mag ask pero para lang malinaw since sabi niya nga single siya. Ganun lang daw talaga siya kahit sa mga ex niya. Nagiging friends parin daw. So pinanghawakan ko yung sinabi niya na wala talaga. Sobrang bigat nung hapon na yon kaya tinulugan ko na lang siya tapos siya din natulog lang din. In short sira yung plano namin manuod ng sunset. Last sunset pa naman namin yon sa El Nido. That night nag promise naman siya na hindi na ulit pag uusapan yung guy. Sinabi niya rin na may nararamdaman na siya sakin. Hindi na “client” yung tingin niya. Bumalik kami the next day sa Manila dahil kailangan kong umattend ng isang event. Mabigat din sa pakiramdam yung pag hiwalay namin dahil di ako sure if magkikita kami ulit. 1 week lang ulit ako this time sa PH. Next day after ng event ay nakipag meet ulit ako sa kanya and nag decide ako na sabihin na sa kanya na mahal ko siya. Nag meet kami sa isang coffee shop sa BGC and after non sasama daw siya kung saan ako naka check in. Sa hotel, umamin na ako na mahal ko siya and if same ba yung nararamdaman niya. Sinabi niya na Mahal niya rin ako then followed by “Ibig sabihin ba nito tayo na?”. Weird pero naging kami na nga.

Dito nag start yung pagiging sweet niya. Kung dati walang reply, ngayon siya pa mismo yung tatawag at mag memessage ng una. Nagulat ako at first kasi hindi ako sanay. Eventually, naging okay naman. Hindi lang siguro ako makapaniwala na kami na after ng mga pag papa hard to get niya. Bago ako umalis pabalik ng Sg ay nag dinner pa ulit kami. Final yakap dahil hindi ko alam kung kailan ulit ang next. Nag ask pa siya if pwede daw mag kiss kami pero sabi ko ayoko sa public.

Fast forward pag balik ko ng SG, 2 days after na hospital ako. Sinasabi ko naman sa kanya lahat and bawat update except yung di na ako maka reply dahil hinang hina na. Nag decide ako na bumalik ng PH dahil walang mag aalaga sakin sa SG dahil wala naman ako pamilya at mag isa lang. Kailangan kasi ng lutong bahay lang at fresh ang kakainin ko. The next day afrer ko ma discharge ay nag flight na ko ulit sa Pinas. Umuwi ulit ako at sinabi ko sa kanya na nasa Pinas ako ulit. Parang nagulat lang yung reaksyon niya. Hinayaan ko lang dahil mahina pa ang katawan ko. Konting message lang dahil nagpapalakas pa. After a week pa ulit kami nag kita. Wala namang nagbago. Na enjoy ko yung time kasama siya. Nag request ako sa company na mag stay sa pinas ng 20 more days. Pinayagan naman ako mag WFH and mas nasulit ko yung time sa Pinas. Every other day kung lumabas kami, minsan mall, minsan staycation. Ako yung nagbabayad lanat since wala siyang work. Tinigil niya na daw yung work niya sa site at sinabing maghahanap na ng formal na work. Maayos naman kasi ang background niya pero for some reason mas pinili niya maging escort. Pinag usapan din namin yon na tutulungan ko siya para makaalis siya doon sa work na yon. 

Marami kaming naging plano. Isa yung pag punta niya rin sa SG para mag work. Gusto niya rin ako makasama dahil mahirap daw ang LDR pero promise namin sa isat isa na magiging matatag kami. Fast forward sa pagaalis ko pabalik ulit ng SG, nagkita pa ulit kami one last time sa Makati para mag kape lang at mag sulit ng oras. Kinahapunan pa ang alis ko. Aaminin ko iyon na ang pinakamabigat na alis ko dahil naiisip ko yung mga oras na magkasama kami. Mamimiss ko siya ng sobra. Nangako siya na susunod agad at mag try maghanap ng work sa SG. Ako ang nag poprovide ngayon ng grocerry niya and minsan food deliveries pag ayaw niya mag luto. Wala naman problema sa akin kaysa bumalik siya sa website.

1 day before ng monthsary namin ay may na receive akong message sa viber.  Ang dami ring missed calls. Sunday yon kaya late akong nagising. “Ikaw ba si _ ?” Hindi ako nag rereply since hindi naman naka register ang number. “Kilala mo ba si _?” para akong binuhusan ng malamig na tubig. Bumilis ang kabog ng dibdib ko. Tumatawag ulit pero hindi ko sinagot. Nag reply ako ng “Who is this? Saan mo nakuha ang number ko?”. Matagal ang naging reply niya at mukhang mahaba ang susunod niyang message dahil nakikita ko ang icon ng typing indicator. “Jowa niya ako…” followed by mahabang message na ang summary ay nakipag hiwalay daw sa kanya dahil mas pinili ako dahil yun ang plano niya para sa magandang future. Siya yung guy na sinasabi ng BF ko na “dinate” nya before. Mag ingat daw ako dahil madami daw siyang lalaki at hindi lang ako. Paano daw ako nakakasiguro na ako lang. Noong mga oras na yon grabe yung pawis ko. Tumawag ulit at sinagot ko. Sinabi nya lang sa akin na ang purpose ng pagtawag niya ay para sabihan ako na mag ingat. Ang sinabi ko lang sa kanya ay wala akong alam sa story nila. Kung may problema siya ay kausapin niya ng diretso dahil labas ako sa problema nila. Pero if sila pa ngayon ay yun ang problema. Sinabi ko lang sa kanya na if mag loloko siya ako na mismo ang makikipag break. Natapos yung call at tinawagan ko agad yung BF ko. Sinabihan ko siya na wqg magagalit at may gusto lang akong linawin. Nangako kasi ako na hindi na babanggitin yung “dinate” niya before. Sinabi niya na sabihin ko daw kung ano yun. Nanlaki lang yung mata niya pag katapos sinabi niya sakin na wala hindi daw niya kilala. Pinakita ko ang screenshot at sinabi kong impossible na hindi niya kilala dahil alam yung buong detalye naming dalawa. Sinabi niya na magpapahinga daw muna siya. Hinayaan ko at nabigla din ako. Maya maya ay nag message na siya at sinabing nag sinungaling daw siya at totoong ex niya nga iyon pero nakipag break daw siya. Tinanong ko if kailan at napag tanto ko na 1 week after pa yun noong naging kami. After ko makalabas ng hospital. So ibig sabihin sila pq noong naging kami. Sinabi niya sa akin if gusto ko daw tapusin na at okay lang daw dahil grabe ang ginawa niya pagsisinungaling.

Sa hindi ko maipaliwanag na pagkakataon, hindi ako nagalit at parang nabunutan pq ng tinik sa mga nalaman ko. Dahil simula pa lang parang alam ko na sila. Ngayon may sagot na sakin. Pumayag ako na ipqg patuloy. Nangako siya na last na iyon at magiging honest na completely. Sa mga araw na lumilipas masaya naman pero dumadalas ang away namin kahit sa simpleng bagay dahil madalas wala siyang time kahit wala naman siyang work. Mas inuuna niya manuod ng series at movies. Kapag nasa mood siya makipag usap ay ako ang nag aadjust para lang makausap siya ng matagal.

One night hinanap ko siya sa site at wala siya doon. Nagpaka imbestigador ako at nag stalk ng malala. Hindi ako mapalagay kasi alam ko gising pa siya pero wala na siyang reply at matutulog na daw. Tinry ko mag install ng G app. Sinearch ang location niya. Wala siya doon. So safe sabi ko sa sarili ko. Mga ilang araw after noon, bigla na lang siya nagalit dahil sinabi ko na nagsisinungaling siya na nakatulog. That night nag check ulit ako sa G app and laking gulat ko ng makita ko siya doon. Online ang status pero sinabi niya sa akin na matutulog na siya. Doon ko na realize na niloloko niya ako.

Kinabukasan, cinonfront ko siya via video call na nakita ko siya sa G app. Sinabi ko din na tatapusin ko na ang lahat. Nangako ako sa kanya na after noong incident na malaman ko na may jowa pala siya sinabi ko sa kanya na last na yon. Pero nagsinungaling at nag loko siya ulit dahil nasa G app siya. Sinabi niya lang na hindi daw siya yon. Madami siyang dahilan na hindi na kapani paniwala. Hanggang ngayon wala parin kaming communication. Isang buwan na pag katapos ng breakup. Magpapaskong mag isa ulit pero magpapaskong walang iniisip. ",1,1734457610.0,OffMyChestPH,0,1.0,False

1hgg65q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hgg65q/how_do_i_focus/,How do I focus?,"Hey guys, I'm (29M) having a genuinely hard problem with sitting down to start and work on a big project. Whenever I have time to do it, I always end up opting out and doing many tasks around the house instead. This gives me a general sense of fulfillment however I always have a looming bigger task that seems to just coast by the wayside instead of being worked on. I was always severely nervous or distrusting when it came to any medication that had to do with focusing due to people around me getting hooked on them. I started eating healthier, I stopped drinking every day, I go to the gym, I pretty much am trying to get to as barebones as possible so I can try and figure out what my body actually needs. Aside from a drink here and there, or smoking pot at night to get some sleep, I have genuinely progressed with my health these last 6 months and I am proud of that. Now that I have gotten to a point that I am close to considering that it is a chemical issue, I keep wondering if there is something else I am missing or something I do not know about that would be able to help me instead of getting a prescription that would end up me possibly leaning into it once I realize it is helping.

Some context, maybe this will help:  
My dad was always a very heavy drinker, I am addicted to caffeine (just coffee unless its a late night and I need a red bull), cigs, and since I stopped drinking it has been sugar later on into the night.

It has gotten to the point where I obsess over the time I waste, to the point where I end up trying to count how many minutes I wasted today. I am actively thinking right now about me wasting time writing this in the event that it goes nowhere instead of writing which I probably would put off doing other things anyway.

I guess my ultimate questions are:  
Does anyone or has anyone faced this and came up with some answers on how to fix their attention issues?  
At what point is my fascination with wanting to be obsessed at all time about writing unhealthy BOTH before I figure out how to do it all the time AND while I'm just bullying myself into not doing anything at all?",1,1734457371.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

1hgg1me,https://www.reddit.com/r/askaplumber/comments/1hgg1me/best_options_for_gas_line_run/,Best options for gas line run.,"I'm trying to work out the best place to run a gas line to a coffee roasting machine. The roastery is in a garage that has many doors. The gas line is in the crawl space of the attic area above. I cannot drop the gas line directly from above the roaster because the garage door will still be operational. Also, I don't want to dig up the floor. I think the only other practical option is to drop the black pipe down the wall on the left to the left of the window, elbow around the foundation and run it above the floor directly to the roaster. Not ideal because it's a little bit of a trip hazard and exposed to possible damage. I guess I could build a platform or maybe protect it with a threshold.

I think my options are limited but If anyone has any ideas, I would hugely appreciate the input.

Heartbroken and exhausted, she told herself that she needed time to figure things out. But after months of hearing her friends gush about their relationships, she felt ready to try again—on her terms.

The trouble was, Maya wasn’t sure how to navigate dating as a bisexual woman. Past experiences had left her feeling misunderstood, but then she discovered OkFun, a dating app designed to celebrate and connect bisexual singles. It was exactly what she needed.

Scrolling through OkFun, Maya found herself drawn to a profile with soft, playful energy. Jess, a barista and aspiring photographer, had a photo of herself holding a cup of coffee with a foam heart on top. Her bio was short but charming: “In search of someone to make my playlists even better.”

After exchanging messages for a week, Maya found herself looking forward to Jess’s witty replies and music recommendations. Eventually, Jess asked, “Dinner and live jazz this Saturday?”

Maya hesitated. It felt exciting, but also nerve-wracking. Would it be awkward? Would Jess think she wasn’t “queer enough”? Swallowing her doubts, Maya replied, “Count me in.”

The night was magic. Jess was even funnier in person, and her kindness put Maya at ease. By the time the live band played its final song, Jess turned to Maya and whispered, “I’ve got an idea—what if we skip dessert and go get ice cream instead?”

Under the glow of the streetlights, eating ice cream and laughing like old friends, Maya realized something important: love doesn’t come with rules or checklists. When Jess kissed her goodnight, it felt like a second chance she didn’t know she needed",1,1734456882.0,OkFun,0,1.0,False

I know this may sound laughable, but sometimes being richer than God is challenging. Emotionally, I mean.

Being incalculably wealthy since the day you were born can make life…flavorless. I’ve indulged in every imaginable depravity. I’ve ingested the cutting edge in mood-altering alchemy. I want for nothing.

And yet, I’m unhappy. Or maybe unhappy isn’t the right word - I’m indifferently indifferent. Hollow is pretty close, but isn’t exactly it.

It’s difficult to have never known hunger. I’ve tried to feed myself a great many things, but, apparently, I have no appetite for reality.

Until this most recent experiment.

I figured - some poor people seem happy. Maybe pretending to live like them will awaken some dormant hunger within myself.

After two weeks, I was ready to call the experiment a wash. But then there was this moment. I was at a local coffee shop, and I felt a smoldering warmth inside my chest. The sensation was so foreign that I genuinely believed I spilled coffee on my suit at first.

I watched the barista cheerily hand another patron their drink. A custodian walked by me who had a very peculiar melancholy about him. The temperature in the shop was crisp but not sweltering.

The experience was perfect. Transcendent, even. A quiet, beautiful comfort. Like I was inside an oil painting.

But when that warmth dissipated, I wanted more.

So, I bought the coffee shop. Bought every business on that street, actually - for privacy's sake. Filled the shop with paid actors, provided them direction and a script in order to recreate the moment. But it wasn’t the same.

An easy fix, I thought.

Local cops on my payroll pulled CC-TV footage from that day, which allowed me to determine exactly who was in the shop when I was.

I hired those exact people to come back to the coffee shop - my assistant told them it was for a “documentary”. At the rates I was paying, though, I could have told them they were coming to watch me castrate myself. No one would have batted an eye.

My assistant did neglect to mention they would be there for as long as I wanted them to be.

Three months later, something still wasn’t right. I couldn’t put my finger on it.

Maybe skinning the custodian’s family alive was *too* upsetting. I didn’t make him watch, though, I just told him that it happened, figuring that may be a happy middle-ground to reinvigorate his peculiar melancholy without breaking his mind.

I’ve had to re-cast the custodian, unfortunately.

Today, however, it finally hit me. It wasn’t the custodian’s demeanor after all. It was the way the barista looked - she was slightly off from how I remembered her.

Since that perfect day, the woman had undergone a nose job. That’s what was off.

I waved Gregor over, who will be assisting in reverting that change.

A hollow smile slinked across my face.

Soon - I would be warm and full again.",3,1734456760.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

obligatory: everyone heals different!

#before the surgery

i was very very nervous, ive never been under anesthesia before but people usually have alot of trouble drawing my blood.  all the complications really scared me. i didnt drink or eat for 12 hours beforehand as requested by the doctor. i honestly reccomend to eat everything you love in this time, youre not gonna see it for a while

for context, the only thing wrong with my teeth is that they were about halfway covered by my gums. they were not impacted, the root had not gone too deep, *i did not have stitches*

#the surgery

i went in at around 8 am, was very tired, my doctors were very nice and professional and i went under very easy. IV insertion doesnt hurt if they know what theyre doing, dont be scared! i woke up and was out of there at around 10 and felt fine but would be falling asleep every few minutes in the car

i was prescribed oxycodone, antibiotics, and chlorohexidine rinse (0.12%)

#after surgery, day zero

i was on and off sleeping the whole day. at first i felt reallt nauseous but didnt throw up, it was mostly the blood in my mouth. i took out the gauze, slept, took my antibiotics, ate, took ibuprofen, it was all a blur. you will not sleep very well. almost every night i woke up some time in the middle of the night and sometimes had to take ibuprofen to be able to sleep again. 
*KEEP YOUR HEAD ELEVATED*
i have a fear of swallowing my own tongue as well as choking on my own vomit so it was difficult at first to sleep. the swelling hurts alot less if you keep your head elevated. i had a bunch of pillows and rolled up pajama pants on top to support my head but a towel could work too

#day 1

i went shopping pretty much every day of recovery because i kept running out of things to eat. i dont like soft food textures like cheese or mashed potatoes so i was eating mostly pudding. 
*desert hummus will save your life, you need protein!*
i went to publix and got bolthouse farm milkshakes which are cold, soothing, about as thick as coffee creamer so thicker than milk, and have alot of protein and nutrients in them. i also got chocolate hummus which is very smooth and easy to eat
peanut butter is good but sticky, your jaw will get tired and there might be a risk for dry spot since youre straining your mouth to eat it

i was super exhausted this day, very difficult to talk and zoning out constantly. i was sleeping alot as well.
*if possible, avoid talking.* i will go into this further later, but im very talkative, and even the little conversations were making my mouth unbearably sore by the end of the day. bring a notepad with you if youre with someone or going out at all!

#day 2

i woke up feeling well. most days, i woke up feeling really good and like i wouldnt need medicine, and by noon i was in terrible pain. do NOT let it get bad like i did! take ibuprofen or Tylenol, whatever pain reliever you take.

the stomach pain from the medications will get pretty bad, which is why i was avoiding taking mine, but it will eventually go away naturally. dont force it

i tried some new foods, donuts soaked in coffee, soup with very small pieces of tofu. neither of these worked very well because my mouth was swollen and i couldnt chew


#day 3

i felt completely capable in the morning, went to the store again. even if youre not shopping like i was, i reccomend you walk alot. i was only getting about 5 thousand steps a day, but it takes your mind off the pain and keeps the blood flowing. 
i tried eggs this day, also did not work

in the evening i had somewhere to go and my stomach pain was the absolute worst. i dont know how to prevent this but it got better when i drank water so remember to keep yourself hydrated

this was the day i started using the mouthwash. i was supposed to start the day of surgery, but misread the paper. as of writing this i have no problems so i dont think it was a big deal

#day 4

went shopping... again 😅 
this time i was feeling fantastic, so i was talking alot and laughing alot. i took 2 ibuprofen at 12. everything was alright until about 7 pm. i started to have a pain which some here describe as the feeling of getting your braces tightened. its like when you get something badly stuck between your teeth, or you have a loose tooth as a child. i believe its the gums swelling, some peopke have theorized its teeth shifting but my jaw was not crowded and i still had this pain.

the pain lasted all the way till 11. i took 2 ibuprofen at 9 and was a little relieved at 10 30. i was using 2 icepacks and even thinking about taking the oxycodone. i took 2 more ibuprofen and the pain was low enough for me to sleep by about 11:30

#day 5

i had already tried some solid foods on day 4, pieces of salmon and very small pieces of a donut. this morning i woke up and didnt really care anymore so i just went at it and had like 5 donuts. i chew mostly with my front teeth, using tthe front side ones a little, but i havent tried using fully side teeth because i dont know how well my jaw is healed or not.

its about 12, i am in slight discomfort, but not enough pain that ive had to take any medication yet

my stomach pain is fully gone, im energized. i was able to have coffee this morning as well.
tomorrow i have to go out to eat, so ill be updating

#ADVICE
-BINGE EAT. do not invest in anything sugar free, look for anyrhing with protein and vitamins you can. when eating or drinking cold (not too cold, icecream was uncomfortable) things, the pain would be relieved and i could even hold myself off for another hour without medication.
in general the past month or two ive been having trouble eating enough and lost 10 pounds, but  even when i was eating ATLEAST once an hour durung recovery, i was out of energy and lost almost 2 pounds. DONT MAKE YOURSELF SICK if you feel like you're sick, definitely stop. for me, id feel sick and then hungry again 20 mins later, so it wasnt a big issue

-ELEVATE YOUR HEAD, AVOID UP AND DOWNS
doing the dishes and other sctivities where youre changing elevation quickly or exerting pressure (like lifting something heavy) are NOT PLEASANT so avoid them if you can. lying flat is NOT FUN so i reccomend as many pillows as comfortable. 
*SLEEPING ON YOUR SIDE IS FINE*
even when id sleep on my back somehow id wake up on my side. i just like sleeping this way. so far no complications because of it and i was even more comfortable on my side than on my back most of the time, from the day of surgery till now.

-GET A SMALL SPOON
 its insanely annoying to eat with even a regular small metal spoon. look for something shallow, small, and preferably plastic. the best spoon i had was a disposable one i found in publix. you will have to find your way with eating no matter what, i cant really help since i have my own mouth lol

other general advice.. dont freeze your icepack, refridgerate it, and get something malleable, like a gel icepack.... stock up on fun beverages, they wont hurt you and they make it alot less boring...
YOU WILL GET DEPRESSED. i felt so bad at around day 3 i felt like there wasnt a point in living anymore since i wouldnt be able to eat good food for atleast 2 weeks (i just love eating sorry lol), maybe even months, but i PROMISE, going through other peoples painful recovery stories wont help when theres plenty of people who are pretty much back to normal in a week.


im very open to any quesrions and will probably respond very fast. ill try to update as anything important happens

I couldn't find the book in my collection, also I forgot the author and name of the book.

And suddenly he wasn't able to wake up the next morning. And he was able to continue his work after treatment. He came to the US for a stem cell transplant and after that, his condition improved.

1hgfusk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkFun/comments/1hgfusk/a_pride_surprise_bisexual_dating/,A pride surprise bisexual dating,"For as long as Charlie could remember, dating had always felt like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces. As someone who identifies as bisexual, navigating the world of online dating often meant tiptoeing around assumptions, judgments, and awkward conversations.

That changed when their best friend recommended OkFun, a dating app designed specifically with the bisexual community in mind. Curious and a little hopeful, Charlie downloaded the app on a rainy Friday night. Unlike other platforms, OkFun didn’t bombard users with endless swiping or generic prompts. Instead, it felt welcoming, fun, and—most importantly—free of judgment.

Scrolling through profiles, Charlie came across someone who made them pause: Alex, a 28-year-old artist with an infectious smile and witty profile bio that read, “Looking for someone who loves spontaneous adventures and terrible puns.” Charlie grinned and sent a message: “Okay, challenge accepted. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field.”

To Charlie’s delight, Alex replied almost immediately: “10/10 pun. You win. Coffee this weekend?”

By Sunday afternoon, Charlie and Alex were sitting in a cozy café, exchanging stories. It turned out they had more in common than they thought—both loved hiking, sci-fi movies, and cooking experiments that often turned into disasters. The conversation was effortless, the kind that makes you forget to check the time.

Over the next few weeks, their connection grew. Alex introduced Charlie to painting on lazy Sundays, while Charlie took Alex to the best food trucks in the city. Neither felt the pressure to define or defend their identities—they simply were. That’s what made it perfect.

Months later, sitting on a picnic blanket beneath the stars, Alex turned to Charlie and said, “Isn’t it wild how we met? I almost didn’t join OkFun. I thought I’d be on my own forever.”

Charlie smiled, squeezing Alex’s hand. “Same here. But it turns out, we just needed the right app and the right person.”

What are we??? I’ve known him for almost a decade. We’ve been strangers, Friends,  not so friends and medyo more than friends but less than a lover. Nung nagka college gf siya and nagbreak sila, pumunta siya sakin para kausapin lang ako.. to catch up. Same as with me, may long time bf ako pero si long time bf sabi niya okay lang makipagkita with him for closure. (Malabo kasi ending namin pagkatapos nung HS). So ayun, happy naman ako with the long time bf pero nagpaparamdamramdam (snapchat flirting) si less than a lover. Eventually nagbreak kami ni long time bf (not because of him). So nung single na ako, single din si not so lover (NSL).. nagayaan mag catch up. Yung tipong fresh off the slammer kilala mo kung sino first call mo. Sobrang heart broken ako kay long time bf kasi nagbreak kami ng okay kami pero I knew I had to let him go for him to be happy. Galit si NSL sa ex bf ko kasi sobrang bullshit daw ng excuse niya to break up. Pero I always believed in it (pero ayun nga, tama si NSL, its all bullshit in the end—but thats another story)

Before pandemic, NSL and I would always drink and party together.. he thought me bad things.. lahat ng kasamaan at kasiyahan sakanya ko natutunan. He was my go to person for fun!eventually our closeness turned into something more but something less.. we ended up being fuck buddies. However, when I felt something more.. di na ako nagparamdam bigla. I would ignore his messages and calls. To be honest, i got hurt, nakita ko bigla lumabas sila ng ex gf niya nung nagaaya ako lumabas nung bday niya. Alam ko naman ang agreement pag ganyan, nothing more so dont get hurt. Clear naman kung ano priorities ni kuya.. it’s not me that matters, and I’m just a good time. In time, I found someone new too. Nakahanap na rin ako ng bagong bf, but turns out itong bagong bf ko ay tambay sa bumble. Sobrang nahurt ako sa betrayal kasi sobrang loyal mo, tas niloloko ka lang pala. Mind you, verbally abusive tong current bf and. LAHAT NG AWAY PAPATULAN NIYA. 

Nalaman ko na tambay siya sa bumble dahil may magmessage sakin ng “hey girlypops i know you dont know me blah blah..” The heartbreaking message na ayaw matanggap ng mga babae. May mga screenshots kung pano siya makipagusap at magaya sa condo ng girl. Nakakagalit at nakakahiya. Kasi parang by this time 4 out of the 10 times ko na siya mahulian sa bumble. (Thanks to all the girls (strangers, even!) that brought about his sketchiness—i love girlhood). Tinry ko kasi isipin na baka insecure siya, nagsswipe sa bumble para mag feeling pogi. So ayun, naforgive ko siya. Ako pa rin ang ginaslight niya and sinigawan. Ok fine, nagpagaslight ako. Pero i believe in women’s rights and wrongs, with the goal to get revenge.. we got back together. Pero siyempre, competitive ako, mas magaling ako magtago. 

Nagsimula nung pandemic, nagmeet kami ni NSL after 5 months of not talking to each other. Nagcatch up, nalaman ko naging sila na nung ex niya. And eventually finill in ko na siya sa mga nangyari with the current. He was my confidante, Magkaibigan kami, we listen and we dont judge. It felt that he understood me, its like coming home. Parang hindi nangyari yung awkward stage and ghosting phase. May mga spoken and unspoken language kami sa car, nagkalokohan and natuloy ang lokohan, naging something more. We ended up cheating with each other. No bashing please, just want to put this out there, alam ko naman mali at trending ngayon ang cheaters hahahahaa. Long story short, sumama kami sa samahan ng nangagaliwa.

Ngayon, parehas kaming single.. di niya kagad sinabi sakin. Sinabi niya lang nung lasing kami parehas na may nararamdaman kami parehas pero wag namin pansinin dahil magiging kumplikado lang. (sa isip ko, feelingero siguro to na nagiisip na gusto ko siya maging bf dahil single na kami parehas) Umoo lang ako sakanya and sinasabi na wag na namin pagusapan. Tapos binring up ulit niya, mga 4x tapos different days din na lasing kami parehas. Anong point? I just brush it off pero deep inside, naiisip ko na 
we both wanted it, but we didnt know how to begin. That time kasi, dahil ang mindset ko ay “im free at last from my very toxic ex!” siyempre enjoy din ako ng single life, nagddate din ako. At kinknweto ko ito kay NSL, pinagtatawanan namin mga choices ko sa lalaki (obviously my track record isnt good). Tintuturan niya ako pano mag ghost, or kung ano pwede ko gawin kung pano magpacute dun sa gusto ko.. ang linyahan pa na “eto yung perfect excuse dahil newly single ka!”

Kaso dahil siya ang nagbring up na may something kahit di ko inaacknowledge, parang di na matanggal sa isip ko. Lagi ko kasi naiisip na hindi niya ako gusto that way.. parehas lang namin ginagamit isa’t isa for fun and pleasure. I’m just a body to him.. he doesn’t see me the way I see him. Always ako may nararamdaman na something more when we make love. Sakanya ko lang naramdaman ulit yung passion na parang sobrang connected niyo sa isa’t isa.  But of course, dahil sa set up, feelings were put aside because I didn’t want to brave and be rejected. 

To hear him say that may soemthing more, navalidate yung malaking tanong  sa utak ko. He would make remarks na “ I know you,
Alam ko coffee orders mo, alam ko what annoys you.. oy ok ka lang ba bigla ka tumahimik..its the little things”. Sabi nga nila “only the people who care about you can hear you when you’re quiet”.  Hindi naman ako siguro naging delulu lang for the sake of it noh? Binigyan naman ako ng content.. 

For almost a decade, akala ko wala lang ako sakanya. Pero in the end, he said wag na namin itry. Ayaw niya daw ako saktan by being together.. when he didn’t even try to begin it. So ngayon, hindi na kami naguusap (actually di lang siya nagrereply) dahil sinabi ko ulit na may nararamdaman ako on one drunken night. Hahaha dapat ganyan pala para iwananan ka ng lalaki. I felt so vulnerable that night na I had to say what I was feeling. Although minimize ko by saying “alam ko ang place ko with you, let’s not talk about it anymore”. Tanga ko rin eh.. naging matapang na nga hindi pa 100%. He apologized and acknowledge my feelings. But that same day.. he made a pass on my friend. So what are you really saying sorry for diba. Hindi ko alam kung alam niya na alam ko. Things got awkward after from quick replies to not hearing from him for days, and eventually rust grew between telephones.

Hindi naman ako nageexpect na maging kami, dahil kilala namin isa’t isa, alam namin galawan kung pano mangloko. Twin flames kumbaga. Pero he will always be my what if. Stinop niya kagad yung possibility of what couldve been dahil ayaw niya maging complicated. I dont think na I hold space in his mind the way he does mine which isnt fair. I know I could’ve loved him, all his imperfections, but he won’t let me. I also know that in the end it wont work out.. parehas ba kaming takot?

Gusto ko mawala na siya sa life ko and  walang what if sakin. To have no regrets that I gave my all. Mahal ko siya..pero sa mga recent na nangyari, hindi ko siya gusto.. he was always that person, but loving him made me see the goodness in him. I thought i meant something more, i thought I was also his person, but no. Never assume.

 Siguro bumabalik lang siya dahil alam niya mababa standards and self esteem ko.  Kelangan ko na siya iiwan sa 2024. No more what ifs and doubts next year.  I loved him for years.. but we were both afraid of love.. and he was afraid to change. 

Goodbye to my greatest love that didn’t even happen, it’s time to leave 10 years of unspoken agreements, knowing looks, inside jokes and shared secrets. I will always look at you  knowing you hurt me the most, even if we never even dated. Hopefully, soon, luck will find me that the person I love will love me back. 

PS magparamdam ka naman please, kelangan ko pa ng isang lesson before 2024 ends to kick start my weight loss journey Ha ha ha joke lang.. 🥲

The words struck me because I have been struggling to show patience towards my mother in her advancing disease. I flip-flop between sorrow and anger and very rarely am vulnerable enough to meet my mother in presence. The sorrow for who she was and the anxiety of her increasing care needs make me feel lost at sea, but I pray consistently for peace of mind. I can tell that I will regret my impatience or lack of tenderness in getting caught up with surviving the day-ins and day-outs. The passage that she left for me said this: 

“Despise not thy mother when she is old.” 

It immediately had me in tears because of its painful truth. Upon googling the lines a woman named Barbara’s blog from 2009 brought me to these words from an unknown writer:

Blessed are they who know that my ears today
Must strain to hear the things they say.
Blessed are they who seem to know
That my eyes are dim and wits are slow.
Blessed are they who look away
When coffee spilled at the table today.
Blessed are they with a cheery smile
Who stop to chat for a little while.
Blessed are they who never say
“You’ve told that story twice today.”
Blessed are they who know the ways
To bring back memories of yesterday.
Blessed are they who make it known
That I’m loved, respected, and not alone.
Blessed are they who know I’m at a loss
To find the strength to carry the cross.
Blessed are they who ease the way
On my journey Home in loving ways.

Ok, so my whole process of thinking is always imagining conversations and/or scenarios, fantasizing about things and I think it's part of why i'm so bad in focusing on things, as I slip into imaginary things so easily.

When I ""explain"" things to someone on my head, is never a person I really know, just a healthcare worker or something like that. Also I'd rather have fantasies about quite basic things, like drinking coffee with someone, then fantasize it over and over again, until it's a perfect scenario. Actually going to do stuff like that is awful.

And I do it constantly, all of the time. I much prefer my own reality, than the actual one, but can still tell them easily apart.

I just read that extensive daydreaming is a schizoid trait, but I do not know what kind of daydreaming.

I am still very confused how they'd give SzPD and BPD diagnoses to someone, as the main traits seem to be quite the oppisite.

But maybe it's because I haven't had friends since childhood and do not go to social situations, but couldn't that just social anxiety. But the BPD is obvious, even tho it doesn't show up that much in relationships since I just have my family, but the mood swings, anger and self harm are really bad.

1hgfh1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hgfh1h/17_years_of_intense_chronic_back_pain_sos/,"17 years of intense, chronic back pain. SOS.","I am a 34 year old female, 5'5"", approximately 140lbs, non-smoker, taking percocet gabapentin baclofen and Strattera, currently diagnosed with chronic thoracic back pain and muscle spasms, and adhd. I eat mainly organic foods, only drink water and 1 cup of coffee per day, and generally consume low amounts of real sugar.

I have had severe chronic pain in my thoracic spine, constant muscle spasms in my trapezius, rhomboid, teres minor, and spinas thoracis muscles, numbness and tingling in the last 2 fingers of my hands, and cold ""zaps"" on the very top of my head, for the past 17 years.

The pain and spasms are constant, with variable intensity. The main pain is a vice-like, crushing, burning, intense pain. The best I have described it is feeling like ""a hot poker stuck between my vertebrae"". The pain has been so intense at times, that I've been admitted to the ER and given morphine injections. It hurts to breathe, as the pain can wrap around the ribs from the spine. I can't look down, as the pain feels like it stretches from the main area and might ""snap"". I've been unable to get out of bed and unable to speak because of the pain level. Often days I have times where I am shaking from the sharp, deep pains, and have to focus on my breathing.
The numbness and tingling in my hands is recurring but random, and happens most often when I am cold. The cold ""zaps"" on the top of my head have been the newest development, happening a handful of times and lasting around an hour each time.

These issues all began in 2007 when I was 17 and got into a car accident. I hit a deer, no airbags deployed, and I got severe whiplash. I was sent to physical therapy and later a rheumatologist. Physical therapy made my pain worse, and the rheumatologist performed a rhizotomy on my lower back, as they found I had bone spurs. They prescribed me low grade narcotics, which helped temporarily. The rhizotomy helped greatly, and I have had no symptoms in my low back since. But my upper back has always been the main problem.

From 2007-2013 my pain and symptoms have got worse.  I went from the physical therapist, to the rheumatologist, to a spine surgeon/specialist, who provided more medication, performed epidural steroid injections and trigger point injections, both of which made my pain worse. After those, the specialist said he could not do anything else for me, as he did not see a need to do open back surgery. 

In continued search of relief, in 2016 I moved to the metro Detroit area to become a patient at a renown hospital, and attended their pain clinic. They offered the same kind of injections, which I declined, and they continued with medication. After a couple of years, and still desperate for answers, I had them refer me to another spine specialist. That specialist also said he didn't see a need for open back surgery, but referred me to another surgeon for a Spinal Cord Stimulator consultation. In 2018 I did the trial and full surgery for the Spinal Cord Stimulator implant. The implant combined with my medication seemed to finally give me somewhat manageable relief, and I was able to work out and do more activities than I had in over a decade. It felt wonderful, but was short-lived. The pain crept back in once again and became unmanageable. I had my device tinkered with, replaced and upgraded the device last year, and it has gotten to a point where now if I have the device on at all, it sends my muscles into a complete spasm and pain flare up for about a week. I have had the device turned off for several months now, and only find relief in the brief windows that my medications are working. 

I have considered applying for disability for years. These issues have affected every one of my jobs over the years. The medical bills and pain have stunted every aspect of my life. I lost all of my 20s and most of my 30s to date to this pain. I've accepted a long time ago that this will be a lifelong affliction, but what drives me mad every day is the lack of answers.
How have I had several xrays and MRIs over the past 17 years, yet not a single doctor, of the probably 30 I've consulted, can give me any kind of diagnosis?

I recently began demanding every test I can think of, and diving into others' accounts of simular issues via reddit. I suspected it may be damage to my dorsal scapular nerve, so I had an EMG and nerve conduction study, both of which came back normal.

I am now waiting to have a new MRI done. Since I have the Stimulator implant, I have to wait for a special machine, which takes about 1-2 months to be scheduled, so it will likely be several months until I can get the scan reviewed.
I hadn't had one since 2018 so I am assuming there has been some change, but I am mentally prepared for it to once again come back as normal.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience, advice, anything, that they can offer me on this. Is there something I'm missing? A disorder I should be aware of, a test I should have done -- I am open to absolutely anything at this point.

I am definitely a ""suffer in silence"" type, and I'm known to never ask for help... but I am begging... if anyone out there has anything to suggest... please do.

I'm going to open by saying that these are JUST MY GUESSES and not rooted in any sort of leaks or facts or reality, nor do they come from a sane mind. I've recently become very enamored with the Everyday Luxuries (EL) line and when I saw the 2025 *upcoming* scent names posted on ""Life Inside the Page"", I couldn't stop my brain from wondering what they could be duping.

That said I have absolutely no business speculating. None. I do have experience in formulating personal care and cosmetics as a clinical consultant and I am a fragrance nerd on the side (frag hag??) but that's really all I've got going for me here.

I've listed my guesses for the dupe inspirations based solely on instinct. Some are rooted in the notes from the names themselves, some are more ""attitude"" guesses. Most of what I'm thinking are fairly popular EDPs like the original EL inspo line. Nothing crazy obscure or niche. I've also listed my guesses as to the top 3 notes that I'm hoping are borrowed to capture ""the spirit"" of each inspo, but again, this is just speculation.

These will probably end up being laughably incorrect but I figure I'd give it a shot. Alright, lets get to it:

**All Eyes on Her:** As soon as I saw ""Her"" I immediately thought this would be a Burberry ""Her"" dupe. That's pretty much the extent on my forensics on this one haha. ""Her"" is such a flirty, feminine, gorgeous scent, and it's cherished in many collections. It would absolutely make sense if BBW duped this with a berry-forward approach. I'm thinking sweet, mixed berries, and maybe just a hint of vanilla extract. I see a pink bottle.

**Aqua Hour:** My first thought was ""Acqua di Giò"" by Giorgio Armani, but not only is that a men's scent, it's like *the men's scent*. I don't think it makes sense here. I'm going to go out on an absolute limb here and speculate based on who has a notable aqua-colored bottle which is Tom Ford and the recent ""Neroli Portofino."" I'm thinking less *Caribbean Sea* and more *Italian beach on crystal blue Mediterranean water*: Neroli, lemon citrus, and salt water. Since ""On The Horizon"" already captures a more pure aquatic and ""Getaway Soiree"" has a little ""Soleil Blanc"" DNA in it, I think (hope) they might take this one in a slightly less literal blue water or beachy direction. Obviously aqua blue bottle.

**Guilty as Fig:** Has to be Jo Malone ""Fig & Lotus."" I am actually not a huge Jo Malone fan as hard as I try, nor do I really like fig. If this is the inspiration, I'm hoping they can improve on the seemingly directionless vibe of ""F&L"" and give a more literal, possibly more fruity take: sweet fig, pear, and lotus flower. I don't think they would go as green matcha fig as you get with ""Philosykos"" and I don't think they would go for so polarizing of an inspo as the heavily wooded Le Labo ""Thé Noir 29."" Fig isn't exactly a loved note in my experience. I think either reddish/purple or mid green bottle.

**Imperfect Beau:** This is just an attitude guess for me: ""Father Figure"" from Phlur as the inspo. I'll probably work this out with my therapist, but my line of thinking is ""Father Figure"" is like.... the scent of dating the wrong guy because you haven't entirely worked out your daddy issues... aka an ""Imperfect Beau."" Is it a stretch? Probably. Is my trauma showing? Absolutely. ""Father Figure"" is a really great little scent though; it's clean like a fresh shave but also warm: iris, jasmine, and sandalwood. It's a girl wearing her friend-with-benefits' cologne-sprayed sweater. I would love to see a more unisex, clean scent in the EL lineup. I'm thinking mint green bottle.

**Loyal to You:** My guess is Dolce and Gabbana ""Devotion"". I'm thinking citrusy vanilla, maybe a touch boozy like limoncello but hopefully not as heavy-handed or cloying as ""Devotion."" This would make sense to me as a spring scent, but it absolutely would need to be toned down if I'm right on the inspo. Yellow bottle.

**Madame Mystique:** This was a BIG question mark for me but I'm wondering if we get a little Chanel inspiration here, maybe nondescript ""Chanel perfume"": a little woody, a little powdery, a little vintage, like an amber-colored liquid in a crystal bottle on your grandmother's dresser. ""Into the Night"" already kinda does this, marrying Lancome ""La Vie Est Belle"" with a something that strikes me as being a little Chanel-y so I'm wondering if we're going to get a more earnest take. I don't think they would go super obvious or heavy as an aldehydey No. 5 EDP dupe, but maybe our mystical madame is a floral, powdery, spicy but  lighter take on a Chanel. I see an amber colored bottle.

**Midnight Addiction:** This is another one I wasn't certain about but after some thought, I decided my best guess would be YSL's ""Black Opium."" This perfume has been around for a decade, but it's extremely popular and would make for a reasonable inspiration. It's standard issue if you declare yourself a gourmand lover. ""Black > Midnight"" and ""Opium > Addiction"" kinda makes sense to me. This would be another vanilla, borrowing that from YSL but with a bit of the coffee and syrupy pear. I think deep purple, almost black/grey bottle.

**Pistachio Glaze:** There are a couple pistachio fragrances out there I thought of, but I think BBW would go pretty literal and heavy handed on the sweetness with the word ""glaze"" right in the name. I just smelled Kayali ""Yum Pistachio Gelato"" and figured this has to be the inspiration. I'm thinking sweet vanilla whipped cream and pistachio with maybe a touch of berry or tart fruit to brighten it up or possibly even a bit of yeasted donut/pastry. Bright green bottle.

**Seeing Rouge:** I hate to do it, but with ""Rouge"" right in the name I'm wondering if we are going to get a Baccarat Rouge attempt. This would be another gourmand if I'm right which, by this point would be a lot of gourmands/vanillas but who knows. I feel like so many perfumers have tried their hand at a BR attempt I'm really hoping I'm wrong. I'm not sure they'd be able to pull off the ambergis in a FFM, but a way to kinda get that bite is with a boozy vanilla or bourbon barrel note so I'm thinking if my inspo guess is correct, we'll get that with some saffron and maybe a touch of cotton candy or caramel sweetness. It's been done so I really hope not. Ruby bottle if so.

**Strawberry Flirt:** I immediately thought of YSL ""Mon Paris"" but I'm wondering if this is an instance where if that's really the inspo, BBW could do better. ""Mon Paris"" is strawberry in theory but it tends to get overridden by patchouli. I can see BBW taking this in a much more literal strawberry, fruity sweet direction with some of the sophistication of patchouli musk at the base and maybe a touch of pink or white florals. Surely a bright red bottle.

**Sweetest Song:** Has to be a celebrity inspo here. Billie's been done, I'm wondering if we are getting an homage to Ariana Grande. Her ""REM"" is very lavender and I got a bit of that from the Emily in Paris drop so I'm not sure they'd take that direction. ""God is a Woman"" is all pears for me like what I get from ""If You Musk"" which is staying in the line. Same with ""Cloud"" as inspo, it doesn't make sense with ""Viva Vanilla"" staying. So I thought maybe this would be a ""Thank U Next"" dupe. If that's the case: coconut summer bomb, maybe a touch of sandalwood and macaron. ""Thank U Next"" is such a funny fragrance that morphs from pickle juice to coconut like a magic eye puzzle, it would be kind of cool to see another take on it. Coral pink bottle.

**You're Cheeky:** I was on the fence about this one but I did think this probably meant powdery... because of baby powder and butt cheeks. It makes sense to me! If that's the case, there are maybe 3 possible inspos: Diptyque ""Orphéon"", ""Fleur de Peau"", or ""Chloe"" EDP. Diptyque ""Orphéon"" is definitely powdery and fresh laundry, but there's this cedar/juniper that might read too wintery. ""Chloe"" is gorgeous but maybe a bit too sophisticated for ""Cheeky."" Like, I don't think of coy, flirty or cheeky with ""Chloe."" But jumping back to Diptyque, their ""Fleur de Peau"" is an interesting prospective inspo. It's aldehyde meets purple flower (iris or violet) meets woody musk. It doesn't do any of those particularly brilliantly, but something about how they come together gives fresh powder on clean skin. I can absolutely see BBW borrowing from Diptyque with this one, pushing it more powder and less woody, but with some purple florals. Powder pink bottle, or possibly lavender.

Alright, I've written WAY too much for what is really just a bunch of guesses. But I'm super stoked to get my hands on these and what (if any) of my theories happen to hold water. Anyone else have any thoughts or theories?",28,1734455536.0,bathandbodyworks,10,0.97,False

I can't remember the exact item he used as an example but I do remember feeling uneasy about it. He doesn't know this person's humor. He thinks because it's ""Secret Santa"" and he didn't say who he got that nobody would know it was him. I explained that they absolutely could figure it out by process of elimination if it rubbed people the wrong way.

He doesn't care for this person because they don't enforce the rules at the warming center for the unhoused population in our area that they work at together. Instead this person is seemingly more concerned with keeping people inside under any circumstances than following the guidelines established by those in charge to keep everyone safe and their funding secure. This creates problems where the guests of the center feel like they don't have to follow the rules the workers are telling them because the supervisor won't enforce the consequences. This makes their jobs much more difficult. It also puts the center itself at risk. I understand why he takes issue with this person on a daily basis. This is Christmas though. A time for goodwill towards all.

I suggested he gift this person a generic gift item like a pair of gloves or something that they could use as it's winter 🥶 or that they could choose to donate to the guests if they don't like it. Or a coffee gift card.

I wanted to give an update to any newbies coming into this! My start on this journey is a little different. I started my weight loss journey in August using Phentermine for 6 weeks. I lost 10 lbs on it and went from close to the 180 mark to around the 170 mark. My doctor didn't want me to take phentermine more than 6 weeks due to it being hard on the heart/kidneys. I was able to keep the weigh off but not able to lose more. I ordered Hers and began kit 1 on October 28th. Since then I've lost around 13 lbs in about 7ish weeks. I do like to mention the entire my journey because I think there are some people who jump to conclusions and think people lose water weight with Hers and then stop losing. I had already lost 10 lbs before starting Hers! I look significantly different than I did in October and I have had to buy new jeans as I have gone down a few pants sizes. 

People always ask about the dosage and when to take the meds etc. Here is what works for me and this is what I've worked out with my care team:
150mg bupropion in the morning. If I take it with food I can have about half a cup of coffee with no issues. I don't need or want to take the full 300 mg dose. 
Naltrexone Topiramate B12. I take 1 full pill at night before right before bed. I do not take this in the morning at all. I do not want or need the 2nd pill in the morning. Metformin 1 pill with dinner. I also take a fiber supplement with extra b12. 

I usually have an egg or Greek yogurt for breakfast. Lunch is usually a portion of chicken breast and veggie. Sometimes I'll add or sub yogurt or protein shake. Dinner is usually some protein and veggie or starch.  I only really count my lunch calories and keep those around 3 to 400. Dinner I'm not super hungry so my portion control usually keeps me from overeating. I try to get 7k steps a day. Sometimes I eat out for dinner. If I do, I don't over think it and just have a small portion and take home leftovers. I also cut out alcohol and I don't miss it at all. 

I'm 40s, perimenopausal and I've lost 23 lbs in the last half of this year. Even while dealing with seasonal depression and holidays! If I can do it, you can too!

Please work with your care team. This program isn't one size fits all. Not everyone needs the amount of meds they prescribe. I'm fine on a lower dose. If the green pill makes you tired, its OK to see if taking it at night works better. If you can't do 10k steps a day, thats OK too... Do what you can. The idea is that once you lose the weight that you can continue good habits to keep the weight off. Smaller portions, more protein, more water, more walking. 

Give yourself grace if you have a day or week where you don't do as well as you wanted to. Stress doesn't help in weight-loss. Just do better tommorow. You got this! ",4,1734455406.0,HersWeightloss,1,1.0,False

How do I handle resentment for my partner (26M)? ,"TLDR: I have resentment for my partner. We have talked about the things that have caused my resentment. He is making changes to try and help why I resent him. Although, any time I see those changes I get upset. I figure it is because I wonder why he never did it in the past and why he only tried to help when I ask for it. How do I get over the resentment when I see him trying? Am I too far gone? GIVE ME THE TOUGH ANSWERS! I WILL TRY ANYTHING! (except therapy, I have looked and we can't afford it) 

My partner and I have gone through our ups and downs. I'm not sure if our disagreements are similar to other relationships but I do believe I have grown some resentment from our past disagreements. I believe that I carry a large mental load of the relationship. I do most around the house, I work 3 jobs (1 is coaching and I consider that a passion but I do make $19k a year from it), I pay all the bills (he contributes to the bank account for sure, works full time salaried, I just make sure everything is paid and figure out how to allocate our money). I don't have to work 3 jobs, but one is a passion and I consider it ""me"" time and the other really helps float us to the next check. The reason I think I have too much resentment is that even when we have gone over things like ways he can help around the house, I get upset. Anytime I see him offer to do things I usually do, I just get pissed off. I understand he wants to help but I can't seem to get past the mindset of ""why do it now? I have been doing all of this by myself for 5 years."" Or I have to explain how to do it over and over again. (skip examples for a quicker read) 

Example 1: I planned our entire wedding by myself (not hiring a coordinator was a HUGE mistake, but saved us \~$3k) and asked for simple input from him like ""which first dance song would you like?"" and ""what colors are you okay with?"" I stressed to him how I wanted to practice our first dance but he never wanted to and last minute, 2 weeks out from our wedding, he mentioned practicing. At that point I was so busy with everything else that still needed to be done that I just got angry. I remember telling him the only thing he had to do was find his suit and I would cover everything else. I ended up finding his suit too. Our wedding was great, he really enjoyed himself, but there were a few things I asked him to prioritize, suit, vows, and first dance so that I could have my dream day too. I just feel sad when I think about what it could have been if he would have put in effort to give me all of my wishes too. Regardless, it was still a good time. 

Example 2: This weekend I had a volleyball tournament Saturday and Sunday. Sunday is usually my day to clean the house and meal prep. Yes, I have even gone as far as figuring macros for him to lose weight, suggesting dietary choices he will like, sending meals on MyFitnessPal and helping with macro tracking (this statement is full of resentment but I am leaving it in the post so readers can understand how and why I feel so much resentment). I was so tired, he knew it, and offered to help meal prep. I woke up from my nap after the tournament and heard him cooking and just got so angry. Then I started to make my breakfast for the week, I started hashbrowns and then I needed to wash sheets and towels because when he said he was washing laundry I forgot to tell him to wash sheets and towels too, when I finished loading the wash, I came back to the kitchen where my hashbrowns had been cooking very slowly before I left, but they were now burning. My hashbrowns were literally brown and black in the pan right next to where he was working, he didn't even think to move them off the burner or pop his head in and ask while I was filling the wash right next to our kitchen.

Example 3: Yesterday I worked both jobs, 4:30 wake up for gym, arrive to first job at 7:00, head home at 2:30, headed to next job at 3 and worked until 11:15. On my way home we were on the phone and he said he was getting in to bed. I mentioned that I did not have time to make my preworkout and coffee like I usually do the night before, he didn't even offer to make it for me. But I know that if he would have offered I would have got mad. I just wanted to be in bed by 11:30 so we could go to the gym the next morning. I did not end up going to bed until after 12 because I had to get my clothes ready for work and pack my gym bag (I shower at the gym and go straight to work), make our preworkout and coffee and find gym clothes. I do all of this nightly so I can sleep the extra 20 minutes every morning. 

So anyway, there's occurrences like these almost daily and I just get upset over and over and I am not sure how to fix it. Before we got married I told myself there was a lot I just had to get used to, that I just had to accept my role in a relationship is to be the woman. But I feel like both, and it really sucks. Now I am worried I will hate him for the rest of our marriage and he wants kids. I really don't feel comfortable bringing children in to a situation where they won't see their parents loving each other. Only brings trauma and shapes how their relationships will be in the future. I would hate for my children to feel any type of the feelings I am feeling now. I also don't want kids because what if I end up having to do everything for them, for him, and have no time for myself? Will I even have time for coaching or working a second job to give us that little bit of extra spending money every week? I really feel like I am just not trying hard enough to save our relationship but I don't think I have anything else to give. At this point, the effort it takes to communicate these issues with him is almost too much, let alone trying to find a solution and execute effort in solving the problem.

I’ve been obsessing over one person for the past months, to the point where I feel like I’m in love with them—even though they have a partner. Recently, I invited them out for coffee (something casual) with their partner as a thank-you for their support during a very traumatic event earlier this year. They suggested I invite other people to the gathering, which I actually think is a great idea. However, I became so focused on them that I forgot about all the other people who helped me at the time. That realization makes me feel selfish, and I can’t stop worrying that I might have made them uncomfortable.

I’m currently on Lamictal (175mg) and Abilify (10mg). I’ve read that Abilify can help with obsessive thoughts, but my fixation on this person is still intense—to the point where I even dream about them. It’s hard to pull my thoughts away, and it’s becoming overwhelming.

I’m wondering if anyone has tools or strategies to manage hyperfixations, particularly in relation to bipolar disorder. I’m considering talking to my provider about increasing my Abilify dosage or possibly adding another medication. I’ve read that SSRIs can be helpful, but I’m hesitant because they tend to trigger manic episodes for me.

I need to get this off my chest so this is part vent and part talking about the issues of the gacha. Let me preface a few things: I'm a former Love Nikki player (played a bit of Shining Nikki as well), I've played Genshin and currently on a break from HSR. So gacha is not new to me, nor is Infold's aggressive monetisation. I do however think there's a big flaw with Infinity Nikki's gacha that's need some reworking.

So I'm F2P and been grinding hard for the resonance stones, I did 180 pulls and I'm 1 piece away from completing the outfit. I'm sure, you all are aware of the fact you can claim a recolour at 180 pulls. I claimed it but do not have it in the recolour in my inventory because I do not have the main outfit.   
  
I- \*sigh\*, I'm soo pissed at this! Whoever thought it was a good idea to have a worst case scenario pity be between 180-200 pulls needs to have their cat claw their face and spill coffee on their white shirt!   
  
If the player have hit 180 pity or 200 pity, and need a main outfit to claim the recolours but don't have it. It's a very studid gacha system! IMO people want the main outfit first and foremost. Logically, speaking you'd think people should be getting that first. The recolours would be for daring F2P, low-spenders or whales. I think they need to rework this! The maximum pity should be at 180 where the 1st recolour is or at 160, making 180 and forward just for the recolours. Point is they need to make it so people getting the main outfit is the priority and recolours something people want to attempt at, or splurge.

To anyone who reads this, please remember to put gacha rework into the survey!

The past 6 months or so, I've noticed she doesn't drink that much water. I noticed this in multiple ways. In the past, she would typically let mostly empty water bottles pile up on her bedside table, and this hasn't been happening lately. Additionally, we both work from home and share a water filter in the fridge. I drink a lot of water and am refilling the filter frequently, but it's obvious to me that she is rarely touching it.

When I first brought it up casually over the summer, she claimed she just enjoys her morning iced coffee and feels like she gets enough hydration through the rest of the day via Sprite (she's addicted to the stuff I swear). I suggested that she really should be trying to drink more water and even bought her one of those bottles that you fill up in the AM and has drinking goals labeled on the side to make sure you drink enough throughout the day. She used it for a couple weeks, but now hasn't touched it since late summer. I have been trying to no avail to keep her hydrated. We've tried flavor packets. During the workday, I'll bring her a glass of water when I'm getting myself one. By the end of the day, it hasn't been touched.

Yesterday, she was complaining to me about symptoms that are very obviously caused by dehydration: Mainly orthostatics (lightheadedness when suddenly standing from a laying position), but also fatigue and dry mouth. I told her that she needed to drink more water, to which she responds ""but I just really don't like the taste of it"", and my immediate (admittedly a bit snarky) response was ""Three words: too goddamn bad. We will have to start trying out new filters or brands of spring water or SOMETHING because this is ridiculous. Your body is almost 2/3 water, every cell in your body needs it to survive.

I've gotten zero holiday shopping done and the holidays are just around the corner. I did throw my youngest kids birthday party (yay December birthdays). I started Mistborne by Brandon Sanderson today. A chapter in after work. I started a new TV show called High Potential. I watched the first seven episodes today. Oops.

Of everyone I've wanted to talk to lately the main one isn't a possibility. D, if you read this - I'm sorry and I hope you're happy and doing well. It's funny how you can miss someone so much for their personality, everything they are and do,  and their companionship, but still not be willing to reach out to them because you respect them too much. I'm still rooting for you to get everything you want and desire in life.  

I hate that any time anything happens you're the voice of reason I want to reach out to. The person I want to call and share my triumphs with. Hell, I still use the methods you accidentally taught me to soothe my anxiety and panic attacks.

Meh. I fell asleep while writing this last night. My dreams were interesting. We were having coffee, actual coffee this time ha, and talking. Catching up. You said you were disappointed in me. This morning has been rough, because I know you probably are. You've always been the better person between us two. I'm disappointed in me too. 

I am getting on track though. Things will get better. I miss you.

I have to head out the door to my dentist appointment. I don't want to go. No results from the biopsy yet. One week down. 1-2 more to go.",1,1734454570.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False
1hgf0th,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hgf0th/aita_for_no_longer_being_friends_with_someone_who/,AITA For no longer being friends with someone who doesn’t even know who they are at 35 years old? ,"Forgive me for the length of this, and if it’s too much feel free to skip. But I feel like some of the details are important to truly grasp, but the type of person I am talking about. 

So this friend started out as a coworker. Most of my coworkers didn’t have any patience for her aside from myself and maybe 2 others. She definitely had her quirks with things like being high strung, taking way too long to do certain tasks, making bigger deals out of things that truly didn’t matter. She isn’t a bad person by any means. But, she bumped heads with a lot of people and I definitely understand their frustrations. I felt bad for her and the fact that she was always the odd man out (even though it didn’t seem to bother her lol.) also because it seemed as though she didn’t have many friends in general. Even though she supposedly went to this super prestigious college, and was a debutant.

So when I would have little movie/wine nights at my house I started to invite her and she was super excited to be included. But this would end with her not leaving!!!! Things would wind down, everyone else would eventually go on their way. But not her, she would just make herself more comfortable and act like we were about to make a night of it. Even after giving the usual hints and saying things like “Well, it’s getting late.” She wouldn’t take the hint! I’ve never experienced someone acting this way so I thought maybe I wasn’t clearly conveying the fact that she needed to leave. This happened on a few occasions . With one time her “claiming to be too drunk “and just deciding to go help herself to laying down in *my* bed. I was completely taken aback, but also too tired to really deal with it so in the morning I expected her to just grab her stuff and go. Maybe even feel a little embarrassed that she just invited herself to a sleepover in my bed. Nope! She pops a squat at my kitchen table and ask if I have coffee? 

There were other things that happened as well. Even though she was in her mid 30s, she seemed to constantly be re-inventing herself. Which isn’t necessarily a negative thing. But it would be because she liked a certain man and would turn herself into what she thinks they would want based on their hobbies, personality, likes. It reminded me very much of what high school girls do who have never been in a relationship before. So they pretend to be someone else in order to get a guy‘s attention. 

For example, she liked this one guy. They only spoke over social media, even though he lived locally and they had been chatting for over a year, he never made any attempt to meet her. It was clear to the rest of us that he was being polite and nice, but had no real interest in her. But she knew one of his things was that he loved and owned a certain breed of dog. I so happen to have owned that breed of dog myself. So she wanted to have a wine night one evening. So my friend and I are at my house waiting on her. We are just having a laid-back girls night and so we are basically in pajamas. She shows up dressed to the nines with a full face of makeup and hair freshly done as if we are going out on the town. She then proceeded to ask where my dog is. Mind you she’s not an animal lover and has never shown an interest in any of my pets really. So my friend and I are just looking at each other really confused. She finds my dog, hands us her phone and asks us to take a bunch of pictures of her with the dog. Has a full on photo shoot with my dog lol! Looking back on it now all I can do is laugh at how ridiculous it was. Of course she posted the pics on social media hoping to get the guys’s attention. It didn’t work the way she thought it would. We tried explaining to her in a nice way that if someone is truly interested in you, they will make an effort. But she’s the type of person who has tunnel vision, and you can’t tell her anything.

Not too long after her failed photo shoot she decided to randomly show up at his job to bring him a gift because she knew it was his birthday. Mind you she has never met him before, they mostly talk on social media and have talked on the phone a few times . So she just shows up at his job like a crazy person. She even takes a video with him and posted it online and it’s so second handedly cringe and embarrassing because you can see how uncomfortable he is and just how awkward the entire thing is. Apparently, this also didn’t go in her favor, and she stopped talking about him, blocked him on social media, and deleted the pictures of her and my poor dog from her page as well. But she was constantly doing things like this.

Eventually, I like everyone else screw, tired of her shenanigans. Her lack of boundaries, the way she started to openly talk down on my other close friends because she didn’t like them and they didn’t like her. She would make everything about herself. There was even an incident at my house where I was having a going away party for one of my very close friends. My other friend and her husband who were on the verge of a divorce ended up having a verbal altercation and she tried to stick her two cents in which resulted in the husband slamming the door in her face as he was leaving. She got super upset and emotional and basically wanted everyone to baby and comfort her. She kept saying “He knows me, he knows me. I can’t believe he treated me like that! “That was another thing she did that was very strange by the way. She could have one interaction with a person and claim that she knows them and they know her. Like in a close way, not a passing acquaintance type of way if that makes sense. She would also just randomly call or text me and tell me that she was going to be in my area in the next 30 to 45 minutes and wants to know if she can stop by. I told her on several occasions that I’m not a last-minute type of person and I need more notice. She would say “OK “then literally a week later try the same thing again.

Needless to say, I got sick of giving her the benefit of the doubt and her presence was just bringing drama and stress to my life. So I started distancing myself. She actually ended up moving away for a while which helped. But she came back not too long ago and she’s been trying the same things again. Calling me out of nowhere and asking if she can come over because she’s gonna be in my area. I have told her no every single time. I just can’t do it anymore and I know I already put up with way more than most people would. But I truly did feel sorry for her and thought that maybe having a friend would help. But she clearly needs more than a friend. Yes, as far as I know, she is in therapy and has been for quite a while. Maybe she needs to find a different outlet of some type.

1hgf06f,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/1hgf06f/29m4m_socal_trying_to_see_whats_out_there/,29M4M SoCal - trying to see what's out there,"Hello! I'm trying out this platform to hopefully connect with some folks and maybe meeting in person!

Some quick info about me: cisgender male, Asian (Chinese & Korean), 5'7, average build, homoromantic asexual (averse to indifferent), liberal, agnostic, neurospicy (ADHD), INFP, and Aquarius.

I'm a school psychologist mainly working with special education students in an urban school district. On certain days, work can be exhausting so you will catch me taking a nap at 5pm and miss dinner entirely. However, the long breaks are definitely rewarding (as I'm currently on winter break)! On weekends, you will catch me checking out new coffee shops, brunch spots, museums, or bookstores. You might also see me walking by the beach, doing a random hike with my friends, or laying on the sofa doom scrolling social media. Because I'm a introvert, clubs or bars aren't really my thing. I am down for a late night KBBQ/Pho run though!

Although I haven't dated for a looong time, what I do realize about myself is that I enjoy intellectual or emotional conversations with others. I prefer people who are straight forward and willing to communicate with me. I'm relatively independent, but it also nice to have some company, especially with people whom I have romantic connections with.

i have two wonderful kitties (yes I birthed them), and you might get frequent cat updates. If you see my photo app, 99% of the pictures are them at this point.

I'm looking for someone who is around my age (though I value emotional maturity more than the number), hopefully in the SoCal area (but I'm open for long-distance), looking for a possible long-term monogamous relationship, having similar moral/ethical values in relation to politics or life in general, passionate with your job/hobbies, and willing to listen to me rant about how f\*\*\*\*d up the education system is (jk... or am I?).

My husband prefers drip coffee and has been wanting a drip coffee maker instead of the keurig. Are there any recommended machines that can do both well? To note - we are amateurs and would be learning with this machine how to grind and brew rather use pods. So I appreciate any advice!

I'm not actively looking right now, but if I were, I'd avoid the usual methodologies like the plague and try my hand at serendipity because all my past experience tells me that's where the nuggets of gold are hidden.

Ok, maybe I'm weird.  Or old-fashioned.  Heck, I \*know\* I am.  Online platforms, algorithms, scripted coffee or dinner dates, speed-dating, they're not for me.  If those things work for you, great!  But if not, if they seem artificial and contrived like they do to me, kwitchyerbellyachin' and do something about it!  Live life!

All of my past relationships including some damned fine ones got their start in getting to know people through:

1. Work.  We typically spend 40 hours a week meeting all kinds of different people through our work.  I don't mean preying on a subordinate or fellow employees or doing something else inappropriate to a workplace, I mean being open to possibilities & attractions and seeing how people act & behave & think & feel as they earn their living and interact with others professionally.  Competence & brains & poise & sound values are huge attractants for a lot of us, and where better to see these in action than through work, where none of those things are easily faked?
2. Work Outside of Work.  Guaranteed that I'll learn more about a person by spending an afternoon stacking firewood or editing a story with them than I'll ever learn on a 'date'.  And they'll probably learn more about me that way too.  Can they have fun even when doing mundane or serious stuff?  Are they lazy?  Creative?  Well-grounded?  Cooperative by nature?
3. Service.  By that I mean: volunteering \*anywhere\*, being active in a service club, organizing a work party to clean up trash or weed a public garden or raise funds for a good cause or... ...whatever!  Initiative is a quality that a lot of people find attractive.  Service above self is another.  Where better to find someone with those qualities?
4. Activist groups.  Passionate about saving the planet?  Promoting peace?  Promoting war?  Changing a law?  There's a group for you, even if you have to create it yourself and draw like-minded people in.  For some people there's no better way to form bonds with like-minded people than fighting for a common cause.  Ok, maybe don't join a group promoting war...
5. Avocations / hobbies.  A geeky friend of mine is obsessed with Sherlock Holmes stuff.  Work took him to a new country where he knew no-one outside of his very regimented workplace.  So he started a Sherlock Holmes society.  In a couple of years he'd met his match and they're now happily coupled.  Trying to learn a new skill?  Reach out to others who are accomplished in their field, put out feelers in your community inviting mentors & co-learners.  It can be so satisfying learning new things \*with\* others, and a great way to get to know people.  And of course there's huge possibilities for new friendships & maybe more when taking certain kinds of adult education classes, and it's weird and sad that these seem to have lost their allure as social media & YouTube have taken over from real life.

Like I said, these aren't for everyone.  And there are certainly many more.

I'm quite swamped usually but I can make time in the evenings. I've got a pretty monotonous life, feels like I'm living the same day over and over again. I like reading books, I've not been very regular lately, always had too many miles to walk. Other than that, I have watched plenty of series, movies and anime in the past but they don't make stuff that good anymore, do they? So, I rewatch classics from time to time. I always find those tiny little details that I didn't appreciate when I first watched like Russel Crowe with his runny nose in Gladiator when he was crying. Small but significant, right. Well, we didn't have 4K TVs then and it probably wasn't noticeable in the CRT display. I've also discovered some amazing Chinese stuff, I'll tell you when we talk if you're interested


I read plenty of news so we can also talk about anything you'd like. I don't play games anymore, did plenty of that in the past but maybe we could play something like Uno on Plato if you'd like. If you win, it's because you got lady luck on your side. But if I win, it's pure skill and talent, muaaahahahaha


My comfort anime is Gintama, for those of you who don't want to hit me up, you're welcome. Actually, I am pretty much like this anime, I can get serious and wise sometimes but most of the times, I'm just humorous. Irl too I'm pretty much the same, just that I've got only a few people I can be myself with and they're not always available, so, that's why I'm here. Plus the stuff I'm not comfortable sharing with them 


There aren't any limits for you, you can talk about anything you want, you can even vent, I don't mind. I'm  an idiot but if you ask me for advice, I'll do my best. I can be busy but I'll always be attentive. But I can only keep it platonic. I'm usually very kind and funny but I don't want to mess with anybody's feelings. To unlock romantic stuff, you need to turn 30 on March 5th and correctly guess my birthday


I'd prefer mature people, no hard limits but I'd like it if you're closer to my age or older. I know a little bit of English and I can also talk in hindi.

1hgeqa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dishwashers/comments/1hgeqa3/was_my_workplace_bad_or_am_i_spoiled/,"Was my workplace bad, or am I spoiled?","I worked at a small restaurant run by a husband and wife for 6 months (quit last month), and I hated it so much. Although I believe my grievances are legitimate, I sometimes wonder if I'm spoiled and simply expecting too much from work. The problems I had with the job was:

* I never received a contract (I do kind of consider this a blessing in disguise since I wasn't legally bound to the place, but still)
* Using ""a lot of water"" was not permitted. Using the sprayer for more than a second per plate would mean the husband would come in and say that I'm using too much water, and that I should be careful since he's the one paying me
* Using hot water from the sink was not allowed. I would have to take water in a kettle and boil it if I wanted to clean something more thoroughly. Sometimes the kettle would be used to make coffee for customers, so I had to wait for the kettle to be brought back by the husband or wife.
* They would sometimes bring in a black box with dishes from their own home that I had to clean in the middle of a shift.
* They constantly gave contradictory instructions, so I would be told to do something by one of them, then the other one would reprimand me for doing it and tell me to do something else. As an example,  when things were slow the husband would tell me to take everything off of the shelves and wash them. The moment the wife saw me doing this I was instantly scolded and told to put everything back where it was and do something else.
* Sometimes they would not know if they needed me to come in or not. I'm fine with this, and am perfectly willing to be on standby. However, instead of calling me within a certain time period if they needed me I would be told to call them at an appointed time. I would call them at the appointed time and be told that ""we don't know yet, call back in 1 hour."" I would never know how many times I would have to keep calling back. They also only ever told me what my shifts were one at a time. So I would come in on Wednesday and be told when my next shift was when I finished; it made planning out my week quite difficult.
* They constantly argued and yelled at each other, often in view of customers; it was incredibly uncomfortable. One time the husband yelled, ""Stop fucking talking!"" at the wife and threw one of the little baskets they have chips in towards her; he missed and it flew into where I was.
* Pay was bad.
* The room I worked in was incredibly cramped, the sink was low so my back hurt after every shift.
* No talking was allowed during work because ""you can't talk and work at the same time.""

I found the environment and attitude extremely unpleasant and unprofessional. I worked, and still work, as a life drawing model. Even though it's fairly physically straining, I felt so much more exhausted after washing dishes. After 1 hour I felt like I had been there for 5. Am I just spoiled, or do you guys believe it was a legitimately bad workplace?",6,1734453727.0,dishwashers,13,0.8,False

I had an unreasonable amount of fun writing it.","COFFEE MACHINE – The coffee machine, beloved by all the restless members of the 41st Precinct, is now rendered useless to everyone’s great dismay. 

DRAMA  - The identity of the culprit is known only to you, but what good does it make to simply confess? You need to prove a point, to show your colleagues how consequences of one’s actions may escalate into collective unrest. Surely this will have a profound effect on everyone involved.

\[Drama - Formidable 10\] Convince your colleagues that one of them broke the coffee machine.

***CHECK SUCCESS***

YOU – ‘So… who broke it? I’m not mad, I just wanna know.’

AUTHORITY – Perfect. Intimidating enough to provoke shame, but with a tint of a caring superior who will show mercy to those who repent. 

JUDIT MINOT – ‘I did. I broke it.’

ESPIRIT DE CORPS – Oh no, sweet kind-hearted Judit, she’s taking the fall again. Her answer is quick and absolutely unpersuasive however you spin it. It’ll be best to spare her from this calamity. Choose another target.

YOU – ‘No, no you didn’t. Torso?’

EMPATHY \[Easy: Success\] – He’s caught off guard, clearly. It’s ridiculous to think he might be willing to follow Judit, therefore his first instinct will be to pass this accusation like a hot potato to someone else.

MARK TORSON – ‘Don’t look at me. Look at Trant.’ He crosses his arms and nods in the direction of the civilian consultant, someone deemed an easy target because of his soft demeanor.

TRANT HEIDELSTAM – ‘What?’ He stays calm in the face of injustice. ‘I didn’t break it.’

MARK TORSON  – ‘Huh. That’s weird. How’d you even know it was broken?’

ESPIRIT DE CORPS – You’re now witnessing Torso’s unimpressive logical skill. Perhaps the pressure of the situation hinders his thinking, but no one can argue that it’s a massive downgrade from a brilliant mind.

TRANT HEIDELSTAM – He blinks, the crow’s feet in his eyes betraying his clear amusement from the situation. ‘Because it’s sitting right in front of us and it’s broken.’

MARK TORSON – ‘Suspicious.’ He’s leaning in to Trant’s face, eyes squinted as if he’s trying to deduce something worthy of the most talented detective.

AUTHORITY – It’s working. The chain of argument you’ve started is now unfolding, and you’re feeling more powerful than ever.

CHESTER MCLAINE – ‘If it matters – probably not – but Jean was the last one to use it.’

EMPATHY \[Easy: Success\] – Jean does not appreciate the potential snitching from the satellite-officer. Despite the matter of conflict being quite trivial, you can see genuine feel of betrayal and rising anger in his reddened face.

JEAN VICQUEMARE – ‘Liar! I don’t even drink that crap!’

ESPIRIT DE CORPS – It’s true, lieutenant has recently decided to try and abstain from caffeine, inspired by your newly found sobriety. A valiant effort on his side, albeit it made him even more irritable, which you weren’t sure was actually possible.

CHESTER MCLAINE – ‘Oh, really?’ He puffs his chest, clearly not intending to back off. ‘Then what you were doing by the coffee cart earlier?’

JEAN VICQUEMARE – ‘I use the wooden stirrers to push back my cuticles; everyone knows that, Chester!’

ESPIRIT DE CORPS – Jean’s little habits when it comes to looking after himself have been a running joke for a while. It’s not a surprise that, unable to resist the pull of the coffee machine, he compulsively looks for other ways to exploit it. 

JUDIT MINOT – ‘Ok, ok! Let’s not fight! I broke it, let me pay for it, Harry!’

AUTHORITY \[Challenging: Success\] – Judit is once again trying to disrupt your plan with her selflessness. Take back control, now. Bring everyone’s attention back to you. 

YOU – ‘NO! Who broke it?!’

PERCEPTION \[Easy: Success\] – Silence falls upon the room. The air is thick with tension. Someone has to cut it, or this isn’t going anywhere.

DRAMA – It’s showtime. 

MARK TORSON – ‘Harry…’ He suddenly speaks up, all skittish. You instantly understand why, as he casts a glance at Lieutenant Kitsuragi, who’s been sitting at his desk and watching the drama unfold, entirely unphased.

EMPATHY \[Challenging: Success\] – He thinks this juvenile stand-off is beneath him. Plus, he knows for sure that it’s not his fault. But one jab at his sense of dignity may ignite a spark that’s not easy to suppress.

MARK TORSON – ‘…Kim’s been awful quiet lately.’

KIM KITSURAGI – ‘Really?!’ He turns around on his chair so quickly you’re surprised he didn’t get a whiplash. 

MARK TORSON – ‘Yeah! Really.’

EMPATHY \[Easy: Success\] – He clearly enjoys getting a ruse out of lieutenant. He should’ve known better than to play with fire, but that’s not exactly his style. You can see his confidence rising up to the challenge.

KIM KITSURAGI – ‘Oh, Dolores Dei!’ He swiftly stands up from his chair, ready to strike back against the false accusations. 

PERCEPTION - Everyone is clamoring now, the cacophony of offended voices going through your ears like music.

AUTHORITY – And so it’s done. You’ve succeeded. Like a master of puppets, you’ve turned them against each other with nothing more than a coffee machine.

VOLITION – Let’s face the facts; it was you who broke it. It burned your hand, so you punched it. But then you’ve fallen prey to your own insecurities, and where did they lead you? Do you really think that this is an appropriate way to communicate with your colleagues?

INLAND EMPIRE \[Medium: Success\] – You predict ten minutes from now they’ll be at each other’s throats with war paint on their faces and a pig head on a stick.

ENCYCLOPEDIA \[Challenging: Success\] – This is a reference to the classic novel “Lord of The Flies” by William Goulding, which tells the tale of upper-class boys stranded alone on an island and turning to their primordial violent urges to survive by any means necessary.

1hgegve,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1hgegve/in_depth_trip_report/,In Depth Trip Report,"Background: I (27F) and my partner (34M) traveled to Paris from NYC. We know some French, but not a ton. This was our first time in Europe. We booked this trip 6 weeks ago, and I tried to purchase the necessary tickets ahead of time (Louvre, Eiffel Tower summit, Versailles).

Overview: Paris is amazing. Everyone was kind, and we didn’t have a problem getting around or communicating, despite knowing minimal French.  Coming from an American, just do your best to learn basic French and respectful etiquette (Duo Lingo is a great start). The city is clean and safe. We were out late and walked through many neighborhoods, and we never felt unsafe. I was hyper aware of pickpocketers, but we didn’t have any problems. Like any city, use your best judgment and pay attention to your surroundings. The food is awesome, and I wish America had local spots like the ones in Paris. There is so much to see and do, and I’m sad that we didn’t get to everything we wanted (Musee d’Orsay, Army Museum, Petit Palais), but I’m glad we took our time to truly enjoy the activities we did do. Just means we’ll have to visit again!

Hotels: We had Marriott points, so we used points to cover the price of hotels. We first stayed at **Hotel de Berri Champs-Élysées** for four nights. This hotel was superb. We were upgraded and given macaroons and a choice of two drinks upon arrival. Everything was beautiful and clean, and the staff was very friendly. This hotel has a courtyard/garden that I imagine is beautiful in the warmer months. We chose this hotel because it was walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower, shopping, and many restaurants. To me, out of all hotels that Marriot allows you to use points for, this was the best option for first time visitors. 

After four nights in Paris we took the Eurostar to London for the weekend (will discuss more below). We came back to Paris and stayed on the other side of the city at the **Courtyard Paris Gare de Lyon**. This is a nice hotel and has everything you’d need. I was glad we didn’t stay here during the bulk of our trip because it’s not as close to the more touristy things we wanted to hit. However, the hotel is close to nice neighborhoods with boutiques, vintage stores, and restaurants/cafes.

Day 1: Arrived at hotel. We were exhausted from the overnight flight and 6 hour time difference, so we took a nap. We then walked from our hotel to the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, and around the 7th arr. It was quite cold and started to rain, so we popped into **Cave Vino Sapiens**. This is a wine store with a small wine bar in the back. The wine was good and the cheese plate was delicious, but it was overpriced. It was a choice made out of convenience, so it was fine but we wouldn’t go back. We hit up the Christmas markets by the Eiffel Tower. Nothing extraordinary, but we fancied the mulled wine. Next we went on a river cruise. We did the **Vendettes de Paris Aperitif Cruise**, which was €20 per person and included a wine or beer. There was a bar on board to purchase additional drinks or snacks. Nothing fancy, but it was probably worth the price since a drink was included. The outside of the boat was closed off, so you had to sit or stand inside the glass windows. I wanted to go outside to get a better view (even though it was pretty cold), but it was still a good way to see the city at night. If you are going in the colder months and you want a cruise that is open air, I recommend a different company. We selected this one because it was close to our hotel and dinner reservations. Dinner  was at **Les Marches**, which serves traditional French food in a laid back, lively atmosphere. We ordered escargot, steak frites, and the chocolate mousse. Everything was delicious. I enjoyed the steak more than my husband (he took issue with the sauce for some reason). The waitstaff spoke English and provided an English menu. 

Day 2: We overslept and didn’t have time to grab breakfast or a pastry before heading to Versailles. **The Palace of Versailles** is a must see. The building is magnificent, the history is fascinating, and the grounds are incredible. We did not use a guide, but we spent probably 4 hours here walking around the building and gardens. It was the off season, so it wasn’t packed and we could actually enjoy it and learn French history. I highly recommend going. We walked out of the Palace and towards the town, where we stopped for coffee and pastries at **Juliette**. The pain aux raisins and pastel de nata were delicious. This area had tons of cute, pop-up flea markets along the streets. If you want to shop for unique goods/gifts, I recommend Versailles or Le Marais (discussed later). We went back to Paris and popped into some shops off Champs-Élysée. These are medium to luxury, name brand stores. We then freshened up at the hotel before dinner at **Le Sens Unique**. Everything was good, and the waitstaff was wonderful. We shared escargot, and I got the prawn linguini and my husband ordered the duck confit. The food didn’t blow me out of the water, but it was still a great meal nonetheless. We then  saw the 10:30pm show of **Crazy Horse**. My husband and I LOVED the show! It was sexy, funny, artistic, and powerful. Yes, there is a lot of nudity, but the dancers are  talented and the performances were interesting and sometimes even emotional. It’s a great show for partners or a girls trip, just make sure you know what you signed up for.

Day 3: We popped into the closest boulangerie (**Maison Lucie**) before walking to Montmartre. We got a madeleine and a croissant. The madeleine was one of my favorite things I ate on the trip. The citrus center was to die for. We like walking, as we find it’s the best way to see the city. The walk to **Montmartre** was about an hour, but we drank coffee and looked at all the sites along the way. I recommend getting to Montmartre early in the day before it gets too crowded. The **Sacré-Cœur Basilica** was breathtaking, and the quaint streets were nice to take a stroll. We walked around before grabbing a coffee at **Cœur Coffee Roasters**. Nice spot for an oat milk latte. We walked from there to **Galeries Lafayette** and the **Palais Garnier**. We aren’t into department stores, but the Galeries Lafayette tree and dome were nice. We then toured the Palais Garnier, which is so beautiful. However, there were so many young women taking photo shoots, and it was kind of annoying trying to dodge photos. Towards the end we didn’t care, and just toured the place to see its beauty. We grabbed lunch from **Pépins** on our way back to the hotel. It was a lively lunch spot full of locals, and the vegetarian flatbread was just what we needed. The dough was great and the veggies were fresh. We relaxed at the hotel for a bit before doing the **Eiffel Tower summit**. I bought the tickets as soon as they were available (I think 4 weeks in advance?). I recommend doing this because the queue to buy tickets was SO long, and waiting in the cold would be miserable. We waited for about 30 minutes, and that was with e-tickets. I think this experience was worth it, and we really enjoyed the panoramic view of the city from the top. We thinks it’s something you just have to do once in your life (it’s the Eiffel Tower for goodness sake!). Dinner was at **Cafe de Mars**. The labne dip and beet salad tapas were great, and the drunken dragon was delicious. We stopped at the Christmas market again for mulled wine on our way back to the hotel. 

Day 4: We walked from our hotel to the Louvre. I highly recommend getting the 9am tickets. The earlier the better, as there are less people. We got there 20 minutes early and had to wait about an hour to get in. There were issues with the metal detectors, so an hour wait at 9am is not typical, but still expect a wait. **Angelina’s**, the Louvre patisserie/cafe, was fine but overpriced. Two black coffees and one pastry was about €20. The pastry, a Paris Brest, was AMAZING though. It was one of my favorite bites this trip. We then walked past Notre Dame, Saint Chappell, the Latin Quarter, and the Panthéon on our way to the **Catacombs**. This has been on my list for a long time, and I couldn’t recommend it more. Definitely get the audio guide (extra €5 per person), which provides even more history and information. We walked through the **Jardin du Luxembourg** on our way to a few tapas/wine bars. Our first stop was **L’Avant Comptior de la Mer**, a wine bar serving seafood tapas. This place was busy and had so much wine to choose from. We had the oysters, squid ink croquettes, fish and chips, and escargot. The butter served with the bread was also unusually amazing for some reason. We walked around the corner to **Freddy’s**, a popular tapas restaurant. The salmon and steak were delicious, and my husband enjoyed the duck as well. The waitstaff was super friendly. We walked past the Musee d’Orsay and National Assembly on the way back to the hotel. 

Day 5: We took the Eurostar from Paris Gare du Nord to London’s St. Pancras Station. We got there an hour before departure time and had no issues. It was a great train ride. 

Day 6: London.

Day 7: We arrived back in Paris around 2pm. As mentioned, we stayed at the **Courtyard Gare du Lyon**. After checking in we walked to **Chez Janou**, where we put our name down for a reservation that night. This place fills up quickly and people wait hours for a table, so do yourself a favor and just make a reservation instead of joining the queue. We then walked around **Le Marais** and bopped in and out of shops and boulangeries. I really enjoyed the vintage shops and the small jewelry and perfume boutiques. We found high-quality, unique Christmas gifts/souvenirs for family and ourselves. We grabbed pastries from **French Bastards** (babka pistache was yum) and **Boulangerie L’abeille** (coffee eclair was amazing, also one of my favorite bites). We made our way to Chez Janou for dinner, and it was an experience. We ordered the mussels, steak, and chocolate mousse. Everything was good, and the servings were large. Our waiter was very friendly, and poured his section 4-5 rounds of free shots/tastings. We were there for over three hours, and the restaurant felt like a big party. 

Day 8: Headed to the airport. We flew Delta and had Sky Priority, which made a huge difference. We had shorter lines to check bags, get through security, and board the plane. No issues.",7,1734453035.0,ParisTravelGuide,1,0.9,False

1hgea2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1hgea2b/just_ordered_some_coffee_from_a_roaster/,Just ordered some coffee from a roaster,"I’ve just ordered my first batch of coffee from Square Mile Coffee Roasters. I received a very helpful email thanking me for my order. It said that as the coffee is roasted to order it should be left a few days to off gas. Who’d have thought coffee was like my dad after his Christmas sprouts, we’d have to put him in the garden for a few hours to off gas too. 

I don’t know what the coffee will be like but the service is fantastic, I sent a question asking for their recommendations for lighter roasts to use with the Aeropress and got an instant reply. I was a little overwhelmed by the range of coffees and the descriptions. They were very helpful. 

They recommended their Red Brick and The Filter Blend coffees. It’s the first time I’ve bought directly from a roaster and not just picked up a bag from Sainsbury’s, really looking forward to trying it. ",13,1734452529.0,AeroPress,3,0.89,False

I'm stepping into the world of making espresso at home, however I don't really have the best frame of reference on what is great espresso vs good. I'd like to find local coffee shops that are known for high quality espresso so I can understand some of the characteristics I should be looking for. Even better if they sell their own fresh beans. I know many shops shoot for passable espresso as 99% of the drinks will be with milk, however I'm looking for places that really pride themselves on high quality shots. What do you recommend?

1hge55k,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hge55k/pressure_gauge_question_breville_barista/,Pressure Gauge Question [Breville Barista Express/1zpresso J-Ultra],"Hello!

As I've been itching to get into the hobby, I recently acquired a hand my down Barista Express in great condition. After about a month of use I ran into some of the known issues with the grinder, mainly just inconsistency. I could pull a good shot, but then the next shot using the exact same grind setting would take +-5 seconds.

I bought a 1zpresso j-ultra hand grinder, and the inconsistency issue has vanished. No clumping, no problems, very happy with the grinder. I've dialed in 18g shot into 36g espresso in about 28 seconds, which I believe is pretty good. Flavor wise I enjoy it, however I am using the same fresh beans roasted by a local coffee shop and their shots just have a bit more body to their flavor. I also understand they are using significantly higher quality equipment than me.

The one thing that irks me is all of the videos I've watched on the Express say to shoot for the pressure gauge to be at 12 o'clock, or even slightly more towards the end of the ""Espresso Range"" section. My shots are more in the 9-10 o'clock range, right in the middle of ""Espresso Range""

While changing my grind size small amounts changes the extraction time, the pressure gauge never changes from this spot. Is this something I should be concerned with? I've also seen people say to just ignore the gauge, as long as you have some kind of pressure. I just want to make sure I'm optimally changing all of my parameters. Perhaps I need to tamp harder? Thoughts?

Thank you!",1,1734452175.0,espresso,5,1.0,False
