1jbvflq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShellyUSA/comments/1jbvflq/diy_smart_outdoor_spotlights_using_ha_and_shelly/,DIY Smart Outdoor Spotlights Using HA and Shelly 1Mini,"I have gained a lot from the r/homeassistant and r/ShellyUSA subs and I wanted to contribute something (small) back.

Project goals:  
\- 6 spotlight around outside of the house  
\- If one senses motion, they all come on  
\- Inexpensive  
\- Not another proprietary app

I found some inexpensive, no-frills, lights on Amazon that had a couple of ""one-time coupons"", which brought the price down to $30. (ProTip: if you wait a week or so, the one-time coupons sometimes become available again) They are decent light at 65W with a weatherproof housing (important). I also purchased a Shelly 1Mini for $15 for each light.

The hardest part of the project was getting the housing of the light apart since they use the least amount of wire possible. There is a ""power distribution"" board inside that is screwed to the housing. In order to unscrew it, you have to stick the screwdriver through the mounting hole. Thankfully, I like puzzles.

https://preview.redd.it/unsglyx8fuoe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7391d5b0b576a6d0f53a0f75b771226d812a5805

The wiring is simple and follows convention except for the sensor:  
\- Blue - Neutral  
\- Brown - Line  
\- Red - Load

I removed the power distribution board and extended the two wires to the light. These were what was holding the housing so tightly. (and no comments on my color choices, it was what I had on hand)

https://preview.redd.it/ep78nv7xguoe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f782808f943e4f6218370185ca527c1ae0de3705

Finally, I grabbed the Shelly 1Mini and a couple Wagos and got to wiring.

Shelly 1Mini:  
\- SW - Red from motion sensor  
\- O - Black to Light (power to light)  
\- I - Wago for Line (incoming power)  
\- L - Wago for Line (power for 1Mini)  
\- N - Wago for Neutral (Neutral for 1Mini)

Other than that, the Lines connect to the Lines and Neutrals connect to the Neutrals using the Wagos. Pack it all back in nicely and close it up.

[Two angles of the Shelly so you can see the wiring. I apologize for the lack of wire colors. ](https://preview.redd.it/8rgipro8juoe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=247bf1c179eb68cc8ac9696962b56ff67f2ebff2)

After plugging it in and adding the Shelly 1Mini to HA, I changed the Shelly to work in ""Detached"" mode. This means that the SW does not actually trigger the light to come on. That all happens via HA. The only other thing I had to do was enable the sensor on the device which was disabled by default.

Keep in mind that the physical settings on the floodlights sensor are still respected. 10 seconds is the shortest duration for the sensor to reset as you will see in the video.

Here is a short video of the desired result in HA (you imagine what you are going to see).

[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Frj9v54OAcI&si=r0ydGvScDtNHd8lz](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Frj9v54OAcI&si=r0ydGvScDtNHd8lz)

However, HA now has access to this motion sensor which opens up all kinds of fun. I have an automation set up that if my wife and I are away, and any of the motion sensors are tripped the flood lights come on, then 20 seconds later a light in the house turns on, and 10 seconds later the front porch light comes on. I also set up notifications on my phone so that I know which sensor was tripped. As you know, once HA has control, the possibilities are endless.

So for around $275 and a few hours of time, all of my goals were accomplished and my flood lights can now turn on my coffee maker :)",2,1742046334.0,ShellyUSA,0,1.0,False

Doesn‚Äôt seem like there is coolant in the oil either. Have done a compression test, and all cylinders had about 125 psi, give or take 1/2 psi. It is also running pretty perfectly, no obvious issues.

I don‚Äôt think this engine has an oil cooler, and so far don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the head gasket, just wondering if there is anywhere else oil could be getting in. I will be doing a full clean of radiator and see if that helps, just looking for some advice. Thanks",1,1742046319.0,Holden,1,1.0,False
1jbvebz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jbvebz/aitah_for_rejecting_my_exbosss_job_offer_and/,AITAH for rejecting my ex-boss‚Äôs job offer and burning a bridge?,"A few years ago, I worked as a contractor at a major energy company (Company A) for three months before moving to a staff role at another major company (Company B), where I‚Äôm currently at. While my role at Company B was a max-term contract (three years), it was a big step up from an intermediate contractor to a principal engineer staff position.

Even though I was only at Company A for a short time, I made structural improvements for the project I was in. My ex-boss wasn‚Äôt thrilled when I left due to my short tenure. He didn‚Äôt make any effort to meet me on my last day, rejected my coffee invite, and skipped the usual farewell drinks (so I covered the tab for the team myself), but he did send me a message the next day saying I‚Äôve done well and wished me well in my new job.

Now, three years later, my project at Company B is ending, and layoffs are looming. I applied for a permanent position back at Company A, reaching out to my ex-boss for a recommendation. Instead, he pushed me toward a contractor role, saying it was ‚Äúsomething much better‚Äù (it wasn‚Äôt).

I told him I preferred a permanent position but would consider contracting for a compelling offer. He asked for my rate, and I threw out a high ‚Äúgo-away‚Äù number, assuming he wouldn‚Äôt meet it. Three weeks later, he came back saying he could.

By then, my current employer was progressing a permanent offer, and I had two other promising interviews lined up.

All three options were objectively better in terms of pay, job level, and career progression. His offer would have been a step down, from a principal engineer back to a senior level.

I asked for a few days to consider and will get back to him on Friday that week, and he warned me not to treat his role as a backup plan and I said I‚Äôd take it up if it‚Äôs a staff role. Then came the kicker - He straight-up told me that if he advertised the position as a staff role, I wouldn‚Äôt get it because apparently he thinks I wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance if there‚Äôs competition. I didn‚Äôt react, but took offence at that statement, especially given that I‚Äôve been in staff roles at two other major energy companies. I‚Äôve also proven I can perform when I was in his team previously which is why I believe he‚Äôs willing to meet my go-away rates.

After reflecting, I decided I didn‚Äôt want to work for someone who clearly didn‚Äôt respect me or value contractors. I gave him a call the next day to reject the offer. His response? He hung up on me. Then he followed up with a text saying I had burned bridges, that I wasn‚Äôt worth his time, and that he‚Äôd personally make sure I‚Äôd never get another shot at Company A.

Despite the threat, I replied that I understood his position and apologised, but I had to do what was best for my career and wished him well.

So AITAH for rejecting his offer after he‚Äôs met my go-away rates? I‚Äôve never burnt bridges in my career before and I never expected someone in a leadership position to act this way, especially at a major global company.

So a couple of days ago, one of the workers currently renovating our house, put beans in the chute for preground coffee by accident.
Since then I can't get the machine to work.
I opened it and almost completely disassembelled it to remove the loose beans that were all over the place. Didn't help.
And I can't take out the brewing unite without completely taking the base off.... I managed to do so. There were some beans scrammed behind the thing. Took them out, tested, everything worked fine. Put everything back together, it's stuck.

The manual doesn't give and info about the shown combination of lights, so I'm at a loss here. 
It's not really a good machine, but since the house takes up quite a lot of money, I would be happy not having to spend a couple hundred bucks for a new machine right now....

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I know my gf can get her OWN food with her OWN money but why tf does it matter if I do it for her instead? I'm not her pet or slave or anything. I just like treating her as she's so awesome.

Mind you, I don't even know these guys. These were random guys who looked around my age and they were smirking all about it. Like WTF leave me alone. I hate the word ""simp"" so much. 

Is what I'm doing called being a simp? I thought this was normal in any relationship like what? Yall don't treat your partners?

14 March 2025

# The experimental phase of the weed experiment will definitely start on April 7. 

Minister David van Weel (Justice) and State Secretary Vincent Karremans (Prevention) confirmed this today in a letter to the House of Representatives . Earlier this week, postponement still seemed a possibility, partly due to concerns from coffee shop entrepreneurs about the available supply.

Last Wednesday, consultations were held between the mayors of participating municipalities and the responsible ministers. **Despite the doubts of entrepreneurs about the feasibility of the transition, it was decided to stick to the planned start date.**

# Transition phase ends, full switch to regulated cannabis 

Since December 2023, the weed trial has been in the transition phase. This means that coffee shops in the participating municipalities are allowed to sell both illegal and regulated weed. The experimental phase starts on April 7, in which the coffee shops switch completely to products from the growers.

Coffee shop owners recently expressed their concerns about the limited supply and quality of available regulated products. The government acknowledges these issues, but states that supplies will be sufficient on April 7 to ensure a successful transition.

# Cabinet sticks to cannabis experiment despite criticism 

Although some members of parliament, including those from the PVV and CDA, called for an end to the cannabis experiment, the cabinet is sticking to its implementation.

Van Weel and Karremans emphasize that the cannabis trial is legally established and that a reliable government must adhere to these agreements.

1jbuzqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jbuzqd/best_friend_takes_no_initiative_and_wont/,Best friend takes no initiative and won't communicate. At my wits end,"Some quick background info: I have this friend group with three other friends, we're in our early/mid 20s. We've been friends for over 10 years now. I'd say we have gotten closer than ever the past 4 years or so.

This post will be about one of these friends, let's call her Sasha. I consider these people my best friends and Sasha has also said the same about us. She has said multiple times that she really values friendship and sees friends as family basically, and that she cares a lot for us, which is why I'm hella confused about her behavior.

The thing is that we haven't seen her since the end of September. We literally all live like a 15 minute bus ride from each other. Me and our other friends have met countless times during these months, but Sasha always shuts us down and comes up with some kind of excuse or simply says that she can't. During these 5-6 months she has asked us to hang out ONCE, and that was to come with her to an activity that she wanted to go to. So it honestly felt more like she just didn't wanna go there alone than wanting to hang out with us.

I know that sometimes life just gets to you: Work, mental health etc. We decided to bring up the issue with Sasha, in a really non-accusatory way. We managed to arrange a short phone call with her in which we basically asked if everything was okay and said that we missed her. She replied with ... pretty strange things.  I don't remember everything she said word for word but she got really defensive and basically gave us a list of reasons why she hasn't hang out with us. One of the things she said was that work has been offering a lot of extra shifts and she doesn't wanna ""miss out"", and then she also said that ""a couple years ago we used to hang ut like twice a year and you didn't mind"". We tried staying calm despite being hurt by some of Sasha's comments, cause we were so desperate for answers. Eventually my other friend said something like ""why does it seem like you are getting upset that we miss you?"" and that's when Sasha kind of snapped and was like ""YOU ARE OVERTHINKING THIS. EVERYTHING IS NORMAL. I'M THE SAME AS I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN"".

We eventually hung up and were all kinda shocked by her behavior. I wish I remembered the convo word for word so I could be more specific, but she really made it sound like the only reason she could hang out with us more often before was that she didn't really have anything more important going on, or that she was in a mood to go out or partying and kind of ""used us"" to do that.

Trying to talk things out with her felt like communicating with a teenager. No accountability, no thought about our feelings, no self-awareness, just her defending herself even though we never even attacked her. She came off as so cold hearted. It's been two months and she has neither apologized for lashing out at us or told us anything else about if there's something going on. And we have talked about ""deep"" things many times, so I think that she would have told us if she was behaving this way due to mental health issues or so.  I'm so frustrated case I've literally been stressing about this for almost half a year and she doesn't even care enough to make some time to meet us for a freaking coffee??? Is this normal? I get that life can get busy but  no one is busy enough to not have time for a freaking coffee?

I want some outsider perspective on the situation. Are we overreacting? Is it a part of adulthood to accept that your best friend who lives 15 minutes from you won't even make time for a coffee with you. This has been such a headache (and heartache) for me and my friend's that we seriously don't know if we can continue the friendship with her.  

**TL;DR:** Long-term ""best friend"" has not hung out with me or our mutual friends in 5-6 months despite living 15 minutes from each other. She can never make time for us, not even for a coffee, and never takes any initiatives. We called her in hopes of sorting this out and said that we missed her and asked if everything was okay. She replied with tons of excuses again, got really defensive and ended up snapping at us, and even said ""a couple years ago we used to hang ut like twice a year and you didn't mind"". Now it kind of seems like the only time she has hung out with us more regularly was out of convenience, such as when work wasn't offering her as many shifts or she was in a ""mood to party"" or do certain activities.",1,1742044926.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

1jbuu7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1jbuu7d/2_years_sober_until_i_found_a_legal_drug/,2 years sober until I found a legal drug substitute,"Ive told a few people some of my drug history, but have never admitted to anyone the full abuse.

My whole life I‚Äôve had a problem with addiction, it didn‚Äôt kick in until I was 16 and had my first cigarette, shortly after I was drinking coffee every day. I still do these two things but do they really count? I tell myself that, while nicotine and caffeine are probably the most addictive drugs used in the world. 

Anyway,

Around 17 I started smoking weed, a year later at 18 I was taking pills from my friend‚Äôs parents. I was stealing adderall and vyvanse. About a month later I was consuming 70mg of vyvanse and 30mg of adderall a day. I went from weighing 135lbs to 94lbs at my worst. Eventually I started hearing voices in my head and had drug induced schizophrenia. How did I kick this? The few people I told I said it was from pure mental strength when in reality my source ran out and I couldn‚Äôt find anymore. That was my first big drug addiction. 

 Soon after high school I was on my way to college. At this time I was just into smoking weed. College I started doing a plethora of drugs. Pain killers, uppers, downers, you name it I was doing it. My friends and I eventually rented our own place to do drugs in peace. We really got into psychedelics at one point. That fucked me up for a while. I never stuck with one drug for too long and I would just take whatever I could find. But, at one point I went on a 2 month binge of meth, you can bet I dropped out of college at that point. That withdrawal sucked! That was one of the first big withdrawals I went thru that had me immobile, mentally and physically. Somehow I was able to see it was killing me even tho, after i kicked meth my dumbass tried heroin. Luckily I didn‚Äôt form a huge addiction and only tried it for like a week.  

Soon I found a reliable hook up for Xanax. Xanax was my favorite and it fucked my life up the most at that point. Nothing really ever made me black out fully, yeah some parts of the night were fuzzy but I could remember most of it. But the worst came out of me when I would specifically drink alcohol and take Xanax. One night my girlfriend hung her herself blackout on Xanax and that floored me. I‚Äôm crying as I write this rn. It was a wake up call and I told myself I‚Äôd go sober. I thought the meth withdrawal was going to be the worst I‚Äôve ever felt. I was very wrong. I was in pure agony for days. Going thru withdrawal is like someone is ripping your brain in two, like someone ripping a phone book in half. Shaking violently, screaming at everyone, scratching holes into my body. It was bad. But I kicked it, and then decided I would never do drugs again.

Well that was a lie to myself. I did manage to stay off Xanax and never really get addicted to any drugs like that again but I still took a pill of whatever, or smoked some weed everyone now and then. But I stayed away from the hard drugs and all psychedelics. 

So the years go on and the drugs do to. I‚Äôm around 27-28 and I finally kick drugs outta my life (besides nicotine an caffeine) and I feel great. That‚Äôs until my best friend of 20 years, my #1 homie introduces me to Kratom. He was the closest thing I had to a brother.

Now I‚Äôve definitely heard of Kratom in my years, all my other drug friends would say to Kratom users ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you do real drugs?‚Äù And ‚Äúthat shit is fake it don‚Äôt do nothing for you‚Äù and stuff like that. But I slipped up and thought, it can be so bad if it‚Äôs legally sold in a store, I‚Äôll try this out. My bestie said it gave you a boost of energy or if you took a lot it felt like heroin or something. I bought a baggie of pilled Kratom and popped a few.

First it was a couple every day.

Then it was a couple in the morning and then a couple around late afternoon. 

Then it was a couple around the morning, afternoon, and then in the evening.

Before you know it I was taking 20 pills in the morning at 6am, and then 8 more pill every 4 hours until around 5pm. It got bad, I would feel sysmptoms of withdraw within 8hours of not consuming any Kratom.

My best friend and I were living in the same state that wasn‚Äôt our home state. Eventually I moved back to my home state and he stayed with his gf. One day I woke up for work and his gf called me saying he overdosed and died. He relapsed and was buying drugs off the dark web. He was always into that, ever since college but he kicked it for a while. I knew he started doing it again but didn‚Äôt realize how bad. He had 11 different drugs in his body. 

I was still taking kratom religiously, it‚Äôs been 11 months since his death and I just went thru Kratom withdrawal and kicked it for good. 

People, don‚Äôt do Kratom. Especially if you have a history like mine. That withdrawal was just as bad as Xanax, maybe worse since it‚Äôs so fresh in my mind. I laid in bed for two full days. Crying in a pool of my own sweat as I shook violently. It was fucking terrible. The mood swings were insane, many times I thought about unaliving myself thru the withdrawal. Even if it‚Äôs legal to buy and considered a herbal supplement I urge you to not start using. It is not worth it.

Besides vaping and coffee I‚Äôm completely sober and I plan to keep it that way. I‚Äôm 31, almost 32 now. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have any regrets. Hopefully one day I can over come that. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Don‚Äôt be an idiot like me and stay clean. Even tho drugs can make you feel on top of the world, in the end it‚Äôll only bring you misery and despair.

1jbuu1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1jbuu1q/practical_steps_to_help_cure_the_habit_of/,Practical Steps to Help Cure the Habit of Masturbation,"


(Answered by Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthar)

In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

To begin with, it‚Äôs good to know that you are concerned about this unfortunate practice, Al-Hamdulillah. This is the first step. May Allah Most High make it easy for you to free yourself from this problem, grant you strength and make you, and all of us, pious and righteous individuals with whom Allah and his beloved Messenger (Allah bless him & give him peace) are pleased, Ameen Ya Rabb!

Masturbation is an extremely unhealthy practice, considered unlawful and sinful in our tradition, which has many personal and societal ill-effects known and recognized by Muslims and many non-Muslims alike. It affects a person in the long-run, ruining one‚Äôs marriage, impairing one‚Äôs physical health, reducing one‚Äôs ability to be proactive in the daily chores, and harming one‚Äôs religious and spiritual growth by distancing one from one‚Äôs Lord. Once an addiction is formed to masturbate, the habit continues even after marriage, and in some cases, till one‚Äôs old age. Masturbation can also lead to psychological impotence. Becoming accustomed to a specific form of sexual gratification, a man will prefer watching porn and satisfying himself instead of having sexual relations with his wife. Hence, this practice must be shunned immediately.

As for practical ways of getting rid of this habit, I suggest the following:

1) Take all necessary means to control your sexual desire (shahwa), and avoid anything and everything that may lead you to masturbate. As such:

a) Guard your gaze against casting it lustfully at women. Avoid going unnecessarily to areas where there is fitna and a greater likelihood of you seeing women dressed immodestly such as shopping malls and town-centers (especially on weekend nights). Try your best in finding alternatives for places of Fitna. For example, use your car to commute rather than a public mode of transport like the underground tube. When travelling abroad, do not wonder around the shops and coffee places at the airport; rather, go and sit in a quiet place and read a book. In the plane, try reading a book or going to sleep instead of looking around and chatting with female air stewardesses. If your work or studies involve being around a lot of women, consider alternatives. See if you can find a job where there is relatively less fitna, and if that is not possible, avoid spending unnecessary time there especially around immodestly dressed females. Make sure to turn your gaze as soon as you see anything inciting such as a billboard advertisement which has immodest images. Completely avoid places where there is casual free mixing of the opposite genders.

b) Do not watch TV even for news or sports. Avoid surfing the internet unnecessarily, especially when you are alone. When there is a need, try using the internet in a public place or when your family members are around you. In particular, avoid YouTube and other similar sites where there is a greater risk of seeing something Haram.

2) Always be around family members and other people; try not being alone unless when necessary. Do not sleep alone in your room, and do not have TV or internet to yourself.

3) Avoid bad company, and endeavor to stay in the company of the pious and righteous, in the Mosque, and with learned Ulama as much as possible.

4) Try and fast as much as possible, and generally eat less especially foods that may stir your sexual desire such as meat and dairy products.

5) Continually ask Allah, especially after the Fard prayers, to free you from this habit.

6) Involve yourself with acts of worship as much as possible, like reciting the Qur‚Äôan, Dhikr and Salawat.

7) Consider marriage. The jurists (fuqaha) state that if one is overwhelmed with sexual desire to the extent that they fear committing a sin, marriage becomes obligatory. Speak to your parents and start looking for a suitable spouse with whom you can fulfill your desires in a Halal way.

8) Finally, there is nothing more effective in helping you avoid this sinful habit than exercising your will-power (himma) and fighting against your lower, desiring self (nafs) and your sexual appetite. It may be a good idea to impose a monetary or another form of penalty on yourself every time the sin is committed. Continue the struggle wholeheartedly and you will see the benefits, InshaAllah. For more on this, read the books of Imam al-Ghazali (Allah have mercy on him) in particular his Ihya Ulum al-Din.

May Allah protect us all, Ameen.

I‚Äôm prescribed vyvanse and I rarely take them cuz I fear they age me (as some of you here told me).

So what are some other better alternatives? I NEED something.

Rhodiola is a hit or miss, some days it works really well and I almost get a high from it, and on other days it does nothing. Matcha tea does nothing for me but I appreciate the antioxidants.

If you‚Äôre anything like me, the idea of hosting a digital shindig can feel a tad overwhelming‚Äîlike juggling flaming torches while riding a unicycle. But fear not! I‚Äôm here to guide you through it with some lighthearted wisdom and a sprinkle of practicality. Grab a cup of coffee (or tea, if that's your jam), and let‚Äôs make some magic happen!

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform Wisely

First things first, platform selection is crucial. Zoom has become the gold standard for hosting webinars, trivia nights, or any virtual gathering that involves more than just you and your cat lamenting your life choices. Its user-friendly interface allows you to bring your friends‚Äîor small business clients‚Äîtogether in a few clicks. Just remember to double-check your settings; nothing kills the vibe like accidentally leaving the mic muted while you wail about the correct answer in trivia.

### Step 2: Designing the Experience

Once the platform is locked in, it‚Äôs time to design the event. What are you after? An engaging webinar packed with knowledge or a raucous trivia night that brings laughs and camaraderie (and maybe a little friendly competition)? For webinars, consider incorporating live Q&A sessions for genuine interaction. For trivia nights, prepare a mix of fun and curveball questions. Trust me, nothing bonds people quite like collectively struggling to remember the name of that one hit song from 2002.

### Step 3: Spice Up the Marketing

Now let‚Äôs talk marketing. You‚Äôll want to get the word out to small businesses like it‚Äôs a hot new restaurant opening. Consider leveraging social media platforms, email marketing, and partnerships with local organizations. Create eye-catching graphics, and don‚Äôt be shy about showcasing the fun aspects of your event. People love a good theme! A ‚ÄúRoaring ‚Äò20s‚Äù trivia night? Yes, please! Make them feel like it‚Äôs an event they can‚Äôt miss, even if they‚Äôre still in their pajamas (aren‚Äôt we all).

### Step 4: Include a Sense of Community

One of the most beautiful things about virtual events is the opportunity to foster a sense of community‚Äîeven from a distance. Encourage participants to introduce themselves and share a little bit about their businesses or interests. Icebreakers can be a wonderful catalyst for deeper connections. Throw in breakout rooms for small group discussions, and watch the magic unfold as people realize they aren‚Äôt just a faceless participant in a crowded Zoom room. 

### Step 5: Follow-Up

Now, once the confetti has settled and everyone has taken a mental jog back from the event, don't forget to follow up. Send thank-yous, share highlights, or even a recording of the event for those who couldn‚Äôt attend live. This not only reinforces community but also helps keep your brand fresh in their minds. Think of it as a spiritual practice of gratitude‚Äîafter all, those connections are what will have lasting impact.

So there you have it‚Äîyour guide to facilitating virtual events that feel less like a chore and more like a heartfelt gathering of like-minded souls. Keep it engaging, think creatively, and lean on that community aspect. After all, in a world that often feels apart, what better way to bring people together than through shared laughter and learning? Now, go forth and host like the champion you are!",1,1742043666.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

‚Ä¢ On Wednesday, the Lucas County Commissioners approved a $100,000 economic development grant to HOPE Toledo, an independent nonprofit sponsoring pre-kindergarten education costs to families in Toledo that was created in 2021 as a public-private partnership. Commissioners said that no further funding will be provided to the nonprofit if the state government or business leaders do not contribute more. The county has given $2.6 million each year to HOPE Toledo, which says it is currently $500,000 shy of funding for the school year.

‚Ä¢ Also on Wednesday, the Lucas County Board of Elections certified candidates for the May 6 primary election. There will be no primary election for Toledo City Council At-Large, as only 12 candidates have been certified, with Kristi Kille and Darnell Smith's petitions found to have errors. A primary election for mayor will take place between Harold Harris, Roberto Torres, and incumbent Wade Kapszukiewicz; applicant Shawn Mahone was found to have insufficient signatures.

‚Ä¢ In further Wednesday news, the Lucas County Board of Elections announced that it has received a $480,000 grant from the state government to fund the upcoming May 6 primary election. Normally, costs for elections are reimbursed to local boards of elections afterward, but this grant provides the funding upfront.

‚Ä¢ On Thursday, the Toledo Plan Commission unanimously approved plans for the development of a three story, 52-bed psychiatric hospital at 3350 Collingwood Blvd., the former site of Rescue Mental Health & Addiction Services and Flower General Hospital.

‚Ä¢ Also on Thursday, the Toledo Plan Commission approved a request from the Arts Commission to move the 14-foot ""Kabuki Dancer"" public art sculpture at Levis Square park, which is undergoing construction, over to Boeschenstein Park, which is also downtown. The sculpture was first installed at Levis Square in 1984.

‚Ä¢ In further Thursday news, city officials held a press event unveiling the relaunch of Veo rentable electric scooters around the city for the season.

‚Ä¢ On Friday, a Lucas County Common Pleas Court judge issued a judgment of over $28 million against Perrysburg-based FrontPath, a healthcare management cooperative. FrontPath was sued in court by competitor Medical Mutual for illegally undercutting the public bidding process to provide healthcare to City of Toledo employees in 2015 and 2018. The judgment also entitles Medical Mutual to 7-10 years worth of interest and fees exceeding $17 million.

‚Ä¢ Residents at Ashland Manor are reporting bed bug infestations. The City of Toledo made fixing the problem-ridden Ashland Manor a high-profile action case in January of 2024, declaring it a nuisance property before declaring it no longer a nuisance property in March of 2024.

‚Ä¢ Representatives at the newly renovated Wayman Palmer YMCA have explained building policies after misinformation spread on social media. Though there is a universal locker area for storing clothes, changing clothes can only be done in one of 20 private changing stalls, with signs clearly stating the policy.

‚Ä¢ City officials announced that the construction of a new splash pad at Savage Park will not take place until after the summer. The existing splash pad, which was shut down for a time last summer for violating state laws concerning water velocity coming from the fixtures, will be available for use this summer.

‚Ä¢ The Toledo Salary Review and Recommendation Commission has recommended increasing the salary of council members from $45,000 to $48,870 and the salary of the Mayor from $136,000 to $152,915. If approved by Toledo City Council, salary increases do not go into effect until the next term for each office.

Stop.","I‚Äôve been a trucker for years. Long enough to hear every tall tale there is about seeing something crazy on the road. Every trucker has one, and you tire of hearing them pretty damn fast.   
You‚Äôre hunched in a grease-stained diner, just trying to choke down a diesel-tasting coffee before slinking back onto the highway. But some grizzled long-haul vet on the next stool over is talking your ear off about the time he ‚Äú*saw a UFO*‚Äù or picked up a hitchhiker he ‚Äú*couldn‚Äôt see in his rearview*‚Äù.

It‚Äôs exhausting. The voices change, the faces blur together, but the stories stay the same. Only now, it‚Äôs my mug spitting out an outlandish tale to anyone who‚Äôll listen. And I don‚Äôt like it. Because I‚Äôm not spinning some crazed yarn in hopes of spooking the fresh-faced truckers. I‚Äôm giving them a cold, plain warning.

Because these things? they're out there. And they might be coming to you. 

It was one of those nights so dark you‚Äôd forget there was ever any light in the world. No stars, just black, rolling clouds smothering the sky. My headlights were an island of light in the infinite black, the white lines on the road rippled past in a hypnotic flow.

I‚Äôd driven this stretch of road before and dreaded every minute of it. There was nothing but long grass on either side, rolling outwards in endless tufts. No landmarks, nothing interesting. Just the kind of mindless, featureless terrain that has you tasting the solitude.   
About the only noteworthy thing was that out there, something spooky happens to anything electrical. The old guys call it *dropout.* Your radio dies down to a numbing crackle. Your headlights shrink into narrow little bands. I heard explanations ranging from some weird mineral in the ground, to an alien spaceship sapping away your voltage from up above. But all that mattered was it was real. It was *annoying.*

Because of the dropout, I barely saw the pickup. My headlights were so dim they barely caught in the glass.   
  
*Was that a windshield?*   
  
I hit my exhaust brake and snapped on my high beams as the rig rumbled to a halt. In what little light they could manage, I saw the white body of a pickup truck slumped on the shoulder, driver‚Äôs door hanging open.   


I rolled in behind it, tires churning up gravel, and killed the engine. Hopping out, I craned my neck in all directions. *Nobody*.   
  
The truck was roadside repair set-up, it had a winch in the back, and a brushed steel side-bin brimmed with tools, chains and cables. There was a cartoon detail slapped on the door. *Tony‚Äôs Roadside Repairs.*   
  
Cute, but where was Tony? I placed a hand on the hood. Cold. Hadn‚Äôt run for hours. Leaning into the cab I saw the keys dangling from the ignition, turned a quarter. The radio spewed out a steady stream of quiet, meandering static. *Maybe he went to take a leak?* 

""Hello?""

Nothing. All I could see around me was grass tumbling in the wind, rolling outwards in waves before giving way to darkness. *I‚Äôve got a job to do,* I told myself, as I climbed back in and peeled onto the road, my hands pinching the wheel in a vice grip. *This haul won‚Äôt drive itself in*, I thought, as the white lines started whipping by, and guilt brewed up in my stomach.   
  
I drove a short distance before reaching the tunnel. It was old school, a jagged mouth punched through the mountain with dynamite god knows how many decades ago. It yawned open, and once inside, the world shrank. The only light came from a handful of buzzing sodium lamps, caged in rusted wire and bleeding sickly orange down the cut-stone walls. Maybe three of them still worked. The rest were dead, leaving whole stretches of the tunnel buried in thick, impenetrable dark.   
  
I ploughed into the darkness, feeling like I was driving a submarine, like there was no world out there, just me and the truck. Then, somewhere in the middle, something pierced the black. Two amber lights, blinking softly in and out.   
  
*Hazard lights? Somebody broken down?*   
  
That explained where Tony ended up.   
  
I tried my high beams again, but they flickered in and out, before settling on a weak glow. *Damn it.* I pulled it over to the tunnel‚Äôs side, my mirror almost touching the rock, and dug around for my flashlight. As I opened the door, the humid air draped around me like a blanket. Cold, but rich with some ungodly odor. Not quite rot, not quite mildew. It smelled‚Ä¶ almost like the ocean. Not surprisingly, my flashlight was on the blink, leaving me with a dull, flickering beam to fight the darkness. I cast it as far ahead as I could as I tried to make out the car.

‚ÄúHello? Anybody there?‚Äù My voice bounced down the tunnel, meeting no response.

But there was something shuffling around up ahead. A dark silhouette by the lights. The torch beam was too weak to make out any details, but there was something there alright, *someone.* As I clattered onwards, the silhouette took on a shape. A man. He was waving, hinging his arm back and forth. There was something strange about the motion. It was slow, lethargic. *Up, down. Up, down.* Like a puppet.

‚ÄúYou okay there?‚Äù

As my voice reached him, he started shuffling, like something was dragging him back. He stiffly collapsed into his driver seat. I kept going, the hazard lights drawing me onwards. *Blink, blink, blink.* 

As the dull torchlight spilled along the car‚Äôs silver body, I noticed it was‚Ä¶ odd. I know cars. I spend half my life staring at their taillights, cursing them under my breath. I can name makes and models by the shape alone. But this? It was *nothing*. Not a Toyota, a Kia, or a Chevy, just‚Ä¶ *car.* The kind of thing a kid would draw come to life. The hazard lights pulsed intensely, rippling in a fit against the dark. I looked back at my thready headlights, shook the flashlight and watched the beam cut in and out.   
  
*How come this guy's not hurting for volts?*

I was close enough now to really look at the bodywork. It wasn‚Äôt metal. The torchlight splattered beneath its surface, filtering red, unveiling a twisted network of fibers, *veins,* coursing through the panels. And the whole thing was moving, undulating gently in and out. *Beathing.* My feet froze to the ground. 

I panned the flashlight over the driver's side window. The body in the driver's seat was pale, paper white. Clouded eyes bulging from their sockets, mouth hanging agape. On his shoulder, a round white patch was sewn onto the jumpsuit. *Tony's Roadside Repairs.* A dull, amber light began to leak from his open mouth. 

I should have ran. I was too late.   
  
Something long spewed from the body of the car, tearing and whipping through the damp air. I was yanked off the ground before I knew what was happening, an immense pressure crushing my ankles together, grinding bone against bone. It had me. I clawed at the tarmac as I was dragged back, losing fingernails but desperately trying to fight the pull. I kicked, I thrashed, I screamed. I twisted my body until the boots were wrenched clean off my feet. The tentacle flung them into the darkness and flailed in anger.   
  
*Whup, whup, whup.*   
  
I didn‚Äôt waste a second, I bolted away with a speed I didn‚Äôt know I had, body electric with fear. I ripped open the door of my truck and threw it into reverse. Stomping the accelerator through the floormat, I watched the dials spike into the red. The engine shuddered to the point of stalling, wanting to die right there, but I willed it to go on.

Out there, the ‚Äúcar‚Äù was coming after me. Not driving but *walking,* scuttling on a tangle of segmented legs sprouting from its undercarriage. The ‚Äúheadlights‚Äù pushed out of the body on stalks, pulsing with furious yellow light. 

I couldn't even watch it chase me. My eyes darted between my mirrors. I could barely make out the white flanks of my trailer, but I had to. I frantically steered and counter-steered, keeping it in line. If I jack-knifed in the tunnel, I was dead. 

But then my mirrors caught them, more lights. 

Amber. Flashing. 

Another figure chiseled out of the darkness, drunkenly waving its arm. This time I really *saw* it.

He was little more than a skeleton. Long, desiccated hair plunged from a yellowed skull. The tatters of a denim-jacket, and what looked like bell-bottoms, hung from the bones. I saw that the bones were lashed together by a network of little tentacles, their tips gently glowing, blinking in amber. From the neck, the tentacles braided together into a thick, glistening appendage, feeding back into the car. 

*Angler fish.* Poor fella was the lure.

This ‚Äúcar‚Äù was old. Big round headlights. Wood panels. Rear fins. It was from back when cars used to have edges. My trailer clipped its cadaverous lure as I shot past, shattering bone into puffs of powder.   
A shriek, wet and angry, rattled through the tunnel. It yanked its broken lure inside itself and spat out a crazed, thrashing tentacle. It seized my mirror, tearing it from the cab and tossing it into the void, but I was clear.   
  
I kept reversing. The truck was screaming at me, warning lights I‚Äôd never seen before erupted on my dash in an expensive rainbow. The engine shuddered so hard I thought it would leap out of the hood. But I kept going, until the rock of the tunnel peeled away, and the black night sky rolled above my head.

Then I stopped. The tunnel mouth yawned. Within its shadow, amber lights flickered. Ten, twelve, fifteen, I wasn't sure. *How many of those things are in there?* 

Needless to say, I skipped the tunnel. I backtracked until I had the weakest bar of signal and called the cops, then spent the rest of that night with my eyes glued to the windshield. My head dipped once or twice, but I wouldn‚Äôt let myself sleep.   
  
The bright steel morning singed my eyes by the time the patrol car trundled in next to me, the cop tapping my window, lukewarm coffee in hand.   
They knew about Tony the mechanic. He was reported missing the previous night. They went in, scoured the tunnel with their spotlights, but found nothing.   
  
That didn't surprise me, they acted funny. Sure, they *tried* to look taken aback by my story. But every raised eyebrow was well practiced, every ‚Äú*your mind plays tricks on you in the dark‚Äù* and ‚Äú*You sure you weren‚Äôt drinking?‚Äù* rehearsed to a T.   
  
They know what‚Äôs in that tunnel. Dealing with cases like me, like *Tony,* that's just Tuesday morning. So, all I can do to help anyone is warn them. If you see a broken-down car on the side of the road, hazard lights blinking away in the dark, you might feel like stopping.

1jbujbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1jbujbk/do_symptoms_improve_postgallbladder_removal_even/,"Do symptoms improve post-gallbladder removal, even with a hiatal hernia?","I had a gastroscopy yesterday and they found a small hiatal hernia, which they said I could manage with diet and lifestyle changes, as well as staying on PPIs indefinitely. I also have painful gallstones so am awaiting surgery for gallbladder removal.

I've been doing a strict, low-fat, bland diet of small meals for nearly 3 months now and have lost 10% of my weight, I don't eat before bed etc etc and whilst I've felt improvement, I still get stomach pain (central and RUQ), bloating/fullness and nausea after I eat. I have to take rice cakes everywhere because I can't eat out at all, and frankly I'm becoming miserable. I haven't had any trigger foods/drinks this entire time. 

I'm really concerned that even after gallbladder removal, nothing will change because of the hiatal hernia. It's hard to know which is causing the bulk of my symptoms. 

I want to be able to eat when on holiday/travelling and to be able to have treats on special occasions. I want to eat pickles and spices again, and maybe even have the occasional coffee. 

I also don't want to take PPIs for life, because of the risk of osteoporosis and other negative effects now coming to light r.e long term use. 

1) has anyone with both gallbladder issues and hiatal hernia felt a significant reduction in symptoms post gallbladder removal? Were you able to eat trigger foods on occasion again? Did you still need PPIs? 

2) has anyone had their small hiatal hernia fixed at the same time as the gallbladder removal? Surgery for the hernia wasn't even posed as an option for me, I'm not sure why. Potentially because significant weightloss may help? ",1,1742043459.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

You have the freedom to ‚Å£experiment with different coffee bean origins, roast levels, and grind sizes, tailoring your cup to your exact preferences. Coffee Aficionados will especially‚Äç appreciate this level of control. Refill Nespresso capsules‚Äå with own coffee, allowing for blends ‚Å§you can't buy in-store.
*   **health‚Äç and Safety Considerations:** Some users ‚Å§prefer refillable ‚Äãpods to‚Å£ avoid potential concerns about the leaching‚Äå of aluminum from single-use capsules into their coffee. While‚Äç Nespresso asserts the safety of their capsules, refillable options made from stainless steel or BPA-free materials offer an extra layer of peace ‚Å£of mind.

HAHAHA. I posted sa r4r last week looking for a date, and talked to this guy. I specified naman na I want someone who I can connect with genuinely, and ofc I assumed na he‚Äôs also into that kasi hindi naman niya ako imemessage if hindi? 

Anyway, he‚Äôs not my type (when it comes to physical appearance) kasi he‚Äôs not attractive when it comes to looks, pero I shrugged it off and still entertained him kasi may substance naman siyang kausap. And he‚Äôs funny. Plus he also said na he‚Äôs looking for someone to date. So ayon I set my standards aside and gave him a chance kasi I really like the way he talked to me. We then agreed na mag meet like a week after we met sa reddit. 

Kahapon kami nag meet. Ang initial na plan is coffee lang, pero he mentioned na uuwi na ng province ‚Äòyung karoommate niya so inaya niya ako mag stay sa condo after. Ofc at first mejj hesitant pa ako kasi I already know what will happen ü•≤ anyway, umoo ako bc I‚Äôm long overdue naman na din when it comes to intimacy HAHAHA pero hindi naman ‚Äòyun ‚Äòyung habol ko and I think I made that clear sa post ko so alam kong gets niya ‚Äòyun. 

Fast forward, we went for a coffee and lunch. Tapos we went to his condo after. Kwentuhan eventually became cuddles and inappropriate touching, and ofc bembang HAHAHA. I wasn‚Äôt even satisfied, I didn‚Äôt reach my climax pero siya, he came twice. Pero I shrugged it off kasi, again, hindi naman ‚Äòyun ‚Äòyung habol ko. 

Then nung uuwi na, hindi ko muna siya minessage during biyahe kasi nga I‚Äôm tired bc may class ako before we met. Pag uwi ko, I updated na iidlip muna ako. Pero ‚Äòyung idlip ko, nagtuloy tuloy until madaling araw na bc super tired talaga ako. So pagkagising ko mga 4 am na ata, wala na siyang reply. So ako na mapride, hindi rin ako nag chat muna. Kasi I felt it already eh, na magghost na ako HAHAHA. 

Ayon, until now, wala siya reply sa imessage and I can‚Äôt send him a message anymore. Then he deleted his reddit na. Yikes.

Nahurt lang ako sa part na he sounded so genuine, grabe ‚Äòyung words of affirmation niya and compliments. I was so naive to dismiss ‚Äòyung pag l-lovebomb niya lmao. Bembang lang pala kailangan, sana sinabi mo na lang instead of masking your real intentions? Wala ba kayong balls to do that? Lmao. 

Anyway, lessons learned for my dumb a$$:

1. It‚Äôs so rare to find genuine people online to date, so it‚Äôs okay to be picky. 
2. Never dismiss red flags
3. Never lower your standards, tama na ‚Äòyang personality personality na ‚Äòyan. Pare-parehas lang naman so doon na sa pogi. Charot.

Husband and I are both on leave with our 3 week old. We have two large dogs. In the last 3ish months of my pregnancy and the first 2 weeks postpartum he took care of the dogs. I would often feed them but he did 95% of walking. Main reason was it was very cold and slippery and we didn‚Äôt want to risk me falling. The last few weeks I was also in pain.
I‚Äôm feeling much better now but I am utterly exhausted and I just don‚Äôt have the capacity for the dogs.
I give the baby to husband at 8 pm, relax, pump at 10 and go to bed. Husband gives the baby a bottle between 9 and midnight (whenever baby gets hungry) and puts him to bed next to me. I wake up on average twice a night to feed the baby, each wake up usually lasts an hour. Baby is usually pretty much up after 5, so I maybe get 10-15 minute naps after 5 and get up for the morning at 7. Baby is wide awake so I run around between trying to eat and have coffee and entertaining the baby. If I have time I feed the dogs. Baby gets hungry again at 9. I unload the dishwasher while making breakfast and tidy the kitchen in the morning before feeding the baby again. 
My husband usually gets up at 9-10. I do all the day feeds and he does some diaper changes, tummy time, just hangs out. But it‚Äôs mostly me and the baby eats probably like 5-6 hours a day combined. I do most diaper changes and there are a lot of them. Husband does all grocery shopping and usually cooks dinner. Sometimes we take a meal out of the freezer that I made before the baby came. He also does probably 70% of the laundry and 70% of cleaning (I started doing more of both now that I‚Äôm mostly recovered from labor)

The other day he told me he doesn‚Äôt feel like taking the dogs because it‚Äôs cold and he doesn‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt start walking them again now that I‚Äôm not pregnant (I used to do most dog walking before). To my argument that I‚Äôm tired he said he‚Äôs tired too and he doesn‚Äôt understand why more than me and it‚Äôs my choice to breastfeed and he has no problem feeding baby formula at night so I can sleep. 

I took the dogs a few times now, then every time I come back he gave baby a bottle and I have to pump and I am so tired I can barely stand on my feet and I don‚Äôt know are my expectations unfair? I haven‚Äôt had a single good night of sleep in months (not during the third trimester either) and I feel like I just can‚Äôt take care of the dogs too. He‚Äôs going back to work next week and I‚Äôm not really sure how I‚Äôll manage. I‚Äôm honestly starting to lose feelings for him due to all the fights and loneliness and it‚Äôs sad.

I suspect I will be diagnosed with some form of sleep apnea in the coming months and would like to know what to expect with CN occupational health and with our benefits through Sunlife.  

I‚Äôm fine with a little time off but would prefer to find a way to keep it minimal.

Would it be likely that I could be pulled off the line for a month or more while I get the machine and testing done?  

Does Sunlife cover purchases or rentals of machines and its parts or the mask systems and if not should I be getting alternate insurance before they find out my diagnosis?

I definitely stop breathing and hold my breath in my sleep but have no issues getting to sleep nor staying awake for most trips.  Don‚Äôt use coffee or energy drinks to stay awake so I‚Äôm not sure if OH will care much about that.

What pitfalls or advice would you users suggest when addressing this issue?

Thanks in advance.

Now here are some things I‚Äôve noticed:

These feelings started about a week after stopping alcohol.

It gets extremely worse about an hour after drinking coffee, and it slowly gets better throughout the day.

Marijuana use (listen, the kid can only be so sober) makes it worse as well. I also barely smoke, just to help me sleep.

When I fast, just salt and water, these feelings are almost nonexistent.

I plan on going to my primary care, but I just wanted to see what everyone thought. I‚Äôm aware that alcohol can do some messed-up things to the body that could take a while to recover from.

Project goals:  
\- 6 spotlight around outside of the house  
\- If one senses motion, they all come on  
\- Inexpensive  
\- Not another proprietary app

I found some inexpensive, no-frills, lights on Amazon that had a couple of ""one-time coupons"", which brought the price down to $30. (ProTip: if you wait a week or so, the one-time coupons sometimes become available again) They are decent light at 65W with a weatherproof housing (important). I also purcahsed the Shelly 1Mini for $15 for each light.

The hardest part of the project was getting the housing of the light apart since they use the least amount of wire possible. There is a ""power distribution"" board inside that is screwed to the housing. In order to unscrew it, you have to stick the screwdriver through the mounting hole. Thankfully, I like puzzles.

https://preview.redd.it/unsglyx8fuoe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7391d5b0b576a6d0f53a0f75b771226d812a5805

The wiring is simple and follows convention except for the sensor:  
\- Blue - Neutral  
\- Brown - Line  
\- Red - Load

I removed the power distribution board and extended the two wires to the light. These were what was holding the housing so tightly. (and no comments on my color choices, it was what I had on hand)

https://preview.redd.it/ep78nv7xguoe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f782808f943e4f6218370185ca527c1ae0de3705

Finally, I grabbed the Shelly 1Mini and a couple Wagos and got to wiring.

Shelly 1Mini:  
\- SW - Red from motion sensor  
\- O - Black to Light (power to light)  
\- I - Wago for Line (incoming power)  
\- L - Wago for Line (power for 1Mini)  
\- N - Wago for Neutral (Neutral for 1Mini)

Other than that, the Lines connect to the Lines and Neutrals connect to the Neutrals using the Wagos. Pack it all back in nicely and close it up.

[Two angles of the Shelly so you can see the wiring. I apologize for the lack of wire colors. ](https://preview.redd.it/8rgipro8juoe1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=247bf1c179eb68cc8ac9696962b56ff67f2ebff2)

After plugging it in and adding the Shelly 1Mini to HA, I changed the Shelly to work in ""Detached"" mode. This means that the SW does not actually trigger the light to come on. That all happens via HA. The only other thing I had to do was enable the sensor on the device which was disabled by default.

Keep in mind that the physical settings on the floodlights sensor are still respected. 10 seconds is the shortest duration for the sensor to reset as you will see in the video.

Here is a short video of the desired result in HA (you imagine what you are going to see).

[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Frj9v54OAcI&si=r0ydGvScDtNHd8lz](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Frj9v54OAcI&si=r0ydGvScDtNHd8lz)

However, HA now has access to this motion sensor which opens up all kinds of fun. I have an automation set up that if my wife and I are away, and any of the motion sensors are tripped the flood lights come on, then 20 seconds later a light in the house turns on, and 10 seconds later the front porch light comes on. I also set up notifications on my phone so that I know which sensor was tripped. As you know, once HA has control, the possibilities are endless.

So for around $275 and a few hours of time, all of my goals were accomplished and my flood lights can now turn on my coffee maker :)",3,1742042239.0,homeassistant,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs a chaotic Saturday night, and by sitcom serendipity, the casts of The Garry Shandling Show, Seinfeld, Louie, and Curb Your Enthusiasm pile into this dive, crammed around two wobbly tables shoved together.
The Arrival
Garry Shandling strolls in first, sporting a loud Hawaiian shirt, muttering, ‚ÄúThis feels like a bit from my show, but grimier.‚Äù He orders a plain cheese slice from a man named Sal with a mustache that resembles an anchovy, insisting it‚Äôs ‚Äúwell done‚Äù because ‚ÄúI like my pizza like my monologue‚Äîcrisp and overanalyzed.‚Äù He pays with cash, fishing crumpled bills from a fanny pack.
Jerry Seinfeld follows, eyeing the place like it‚Äôs a punchline. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the deal with pizzeria grease? It‚Äôs like 87 octane with a hint of orange peel!‚Äù He orders a slice with extra oregano‚Äî‚Äúlife‚Äôs simple pleasures are underrated‚Äù‚Äîand swipes a pristine credit card with the peel-off sticker still on it.
Louie CK shuffles in, head low, ordering a sausage slice with a side of existential dread. ‚ÄúMake it fast, I‚Äôve got a life to ruin,‚Äù he grumbles, paying with his phone while distracted by a sauce stain resembling a weeping clown.
Larry David barges in, barking, ‚ÄúThis place is a health code nightmare! Who runs this dump?!‚Äù He orders a pepperoni slice with cold cheese on top‚Äî‚ÄúMake it bizarre, like my social skills.‚Äù He pays with cash, gets 25 cents back in pennies, and immediately complains, ‚ÄúWhat am I, a parking meter?‚Äù
The Rest of the Crew
Kramer crashes through the door, arms windmilling, declaring, ‚ÄúThis is it, Jerry! Pineapple pizza‚Äîthe king of toppings!‚Äù Sal sighs but complies. Kramer‚Äôs wearing a faded ‚ÄúSal‚Äôs Slice Shack‚Äù T-shirt, hoping it scores him a free slice‚Äîit does; Sal chucks him a crust out of annoyance. Later, Kramer orders his slice ‚Äúto go‚Äù just to hear Sal snap the white paper bag open with a sharp crack, then sits back down anyway.
Elaine slips in, ordering a veggie slice and a spumoni, eating the ice cream with a dainty spoon while holding her slice with a napkin‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a barbarian, Jerry.‚Äù She grimaces watching Sal knead dough with his hairy paws, muttering, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a biohazard.‚Äù
George Costanza demands three slices‚Äîmeat lovers because I need my iron, chicken marsala because of my heartburn, and a grandma slice in honor of my mother. His phone runs out of battery as he tries to pay, so he borrows money from Jerry, whining, ‚ÄúYou owe me for that coffee in ‚Äô92!‚Äù Jerry smirks, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even have kids, George‚Äîwhy the grandma slice?‚Äù
Hank Kingsley (The Garry Shandling Show) swaggers in, hollering, ‚ÄúHey now! Three slices‚Äîpepperoni, sausage, extra cheese‚Äîfor the Hankster!‚Äù He pays with a credit card, loudly bragging about the tip. He‚Äôs the one who takes a suspiciously short bathroom break, returning with suspiciously dry hands.
Leon Black (Curb) orders a plain slice but smuggles in a flask of hot sauce, drowning his pizza while saying, ‚ÄúGotta wake this shit up!‚Äù He tosses cash on the counter like a baller.
The Chaos Unfolds
As they dig in, the quirks pile up. Louie stares at the parmesan shaker‚Äôs crusty lid, muttering, ‚ÄúThis hasn‚Äôt changed in 20 years. Neither have my jokes.‚Äù George points to a ‚ÄúG.C.‚Äù scratched into the table, boasting, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine! I was a Rebel!‚Äù Jerry snorts, ‚ÄúYou were a rebel with a spork.‚Äù
Kramer, munching his pineapple slice, says, ‚ÄúI love the subway rattle‚Äîit‚Äôs like a massage for my soul!‚Äù Elaine rolls her eyes, delicately scooping spumoni, while Larry yells at his cold-cheese slice, ‚ÄúThis is a travesty, Sal! You‚Äôre a monster!‚Äù
Hank‚Äôs chatting up Sal, asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened to that Ms. Pac-Man machine? I had ‚ÄòHANK‚Äô at the top!‚Äù Sal grunts, ‚ÄúSome punk smashed it with frozen meatballs in ‚Äô04.‚Äù Elaine pipes up, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt make the meatballs fresh?‚Äù Sal ignores her.
George sticks gum under the table, muttering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my legacy.‚Äù Elaine‚Äôs napkin snags it, sparking a ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre disgusting, George!‚Äù shouting match. Leon chuckles, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall need to chill‚Äîeat the damn pizza.‚Äù
The Finale
It ends in glorious chaos. Kramer tries smuggling a parmesan shaker in his pocket, but it clatters to the floor and rolls under Louie‚Äôs chair. Louie grabs a Louie G. Italian ice (lemon) and shuffles out, mumbling about futility. Jerry caps it with, ‚ÄúWhy do we come here? Bad pizza, loud trains‚Äîit‚Äôs peak New York!‚Äù Garry nods, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my show, but with more sauce.‚Äù
Larry storms out, clutching his pennies, vowing, ‚ÄúNever again!‚Äù‚Äîuntil tomorrow. As the subway rattles past, Sal yells, ‚ÄúNext!‚Äù The tables are a warzone: gum, napkins, spumoni spoons, and a lone chopstick Kramer forgot to use.

I'm someone that, for nearly 40 years of my life, has had some of the best sleep when compared to family and friends.  I have a lot of people around me that have insomnia, need caffeine to be functional in the morning, and are generally miserable and can't function when they wake up.  I'm the contrast to this: I always get great sleep, usually need less sleep than others, and I wake up in the morning feeling great and energized.

In 2022, my SO had mentioned that I was starting to snore pretty badly.  I figured that was due to the weight gain I was getting after 2020.  I'm still very bad at controlling my weight, so that problem just continued to get worse into 2023.  At the end of that year, I asked my PCP about a lot of health issues, weight and snoring being two of them.  They suggested ENT to get a look through my nose.  However, in 2024, around March, ENT said 'no', because I hadn't had a sleep study yet.  Again, I want to point this out: I NEVER had ANY problems with sleep before.  It was just the snoring.

I took the take-home test (because in the USA, you don't get actual healthcare anymore) and hooked the monster up to myself.  I couldn't sleep at all.  I couldn't even get comfortable!  I was tossing and turning for two hours because of the machine.  Finally, I threw it off to get ANY sleep.  Sent it in, telling them that I didn't get sleep at all.  They came back to me saying that my oxygen dipped under 80% and that I was having around 70+ events per hour (I don't know how they could get that when I was perfectly awake the whole time).

Of course, they suggested CPAP because they thought it was severe apnea.  I didn't want to try it.  Went a month, and I started to have issues with my mouth and throat drying out to the point that they got inflamed and actually caused my breathing to stop (I don't think this was apnea, just inflammation from the dryness).  Going back, I relented and almost instantly was given a machine and a bunch of masks.

The first few weeks were torture.  Being forced to sleep on my back was uncomfortable.  The mask was always on the verge of leaking no matter what mask it was, what fit it was, or if it was a new cushion or not.  The humidifier inside was way too hot and overactive even at the lowest settings.  In short, I thought it was the worse sleep I'd ever get.  I was dragging, having to down caffeine in the morning just to get to work, which is something I never had to do before.

After the first few months, I talked with my sleep doctor again (scratch that, only a nurse, this is the US health care after all, you don't get an actual doctor anymore).  She said the numbers were all great and that my events were under one per hour.  She increased the pressure a bit more (she'd done that three times since I started it on her own without telling me) and then said I should be getting used to it now.  I asked if we could check back in in another month, and she said she didn't see the need for it and would only schedule another meeting in a year.

Checked with my sleep therapist and they only had me try different masks a few times until they simply gave up and said ""Well, go out on Amazon or something and find your own masks.  This is what everyone has to do anyways.""  Like...what the %!\*#@ is anyone paying you for?!  Why are you not HELPING me?!

So, now it's been nearly ten months on this machine, and I've used it every night to try and get even the smallest amount of sleep.  I'm still waking up pretty bad and I'm ripping it off in the middle of sleep a good portion of the time.  I have to stay stock-still at night or my mask becomes loose enough to blast me in the face.  I am so very tired and there's mornings that I'm in the shower for thirty minutes just to try and 'wake up'.

So why can't I just...stop using the machine?  If I was having such good sleep before?  Well, thanks to this device, I now need it to even get to sleep!  I am tossing and turning at night and can't even nod off unless the mask is on.  I've tried recently, and sleep just doesn't come.  I have to have the machine on just to get a small amount of sleep, then pair it with coffee to be functional enough for work.  I'm convinced the damn thing has done something to me to cause me to be dependent on it, which I'm convinced (conspiracy brain, I know) is the whole point: get you on a machine till it's rewired you to have it be required.",2,1742041825.0,SleepApnea,4,0.75,False

1jbu1kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jbu1kl/is_timemore_064s_worth_paying_150_over_df64_gen2/,Is Timemore 064S worth paying 150% over DF64 gen2 [PLN 3000 ~$780],"Hello folks! Kind request for advice regarding grinders. 

Before diving into details and considerations below -  the question is: given your experience would you say 064s is that much better to justify the price difference? (seems like general consensus is that 064s is actually better grinder). I'm shopping in Poland and from available options I can see (now with discount) 064s for 2800 PLN vs DF64 2 for 1800 PLN.

To put the question in context - I'm now grinding with Timemore C3 pro and brewing espresso with very basic DeLonghi EC 820 (hoping to upgrade in a year or so to something like Gaggia Classic but will see), using bottomless portafilter. I drink mostly espresso, probably 3,4 shots a day but also like to brew some filter coffee every few days (Aeropress and V60). I got to the point where hand grinding is no longer an option - it's both about very limited grind settings and time spent on grinding (especially with small child at home when you don't have that  much freedom to ""just grind"" :D ). 

Given the above setup I'm pretty convinced I would be super happy with any upgrade to decent, automatic grinder but in the end I decided to go for some option for years and dropped to initial thought to start on a budget (initially thought about Baratza Encore ESP). 

Other threads about 064s and DF642 left me thinking that in other parts of the world price difference is not that big, (I think in James Hoffman's video he said even that Timemore is cheaper) -  if that would be the case in Poland I would go for 064s because: 

* Seems like a safer bet in terms of the noise - (\~80dB vs 100 according to Hoffman's video) and seem like a lot of people complain about the ""type"" of noise generated by DF,
* I like the design of 064s better,
* it's smaller and I don't have that much space on the counter (but still can fit DF), 
* I have a sentiment for Timemore because of my C3 PRO :P 

With that being said, DF64 gen 2 also seems like a decent choice and feels like lots of people here agree that this is a way to go for more budget oriented buyers. My concerns are: 

* reports about the annoying and loud noise,
* I think it's considered a bit more messy but might be confusing something,
* still nice design but a bit less appealing to me than 064s.

Being honest the price for Timemore is a considerable amount for me so I thought I will ask for opinions of the community here. I'm wondering what could be the end result espresso difference between the two - is it that noticeable? I Don't won't to buy a machine that will be too much above my setup (hope that makes sense, just worried that even after upgrading to the Gaggia I still won't be able to feel/extract the difference between grinders). 

One alternative to those grinders I still have in mind is Eureka Mignon Zero, which can be hunted down In Poland for around 1500 PLN or even a bit less - it has 55 mm burrs which should be ok (correct me if I'm wrong ;), seems to be quiet and also give a nice feeling being a product of well known Italian company. My biggest concern is the grind settings knob which is said to be pain when switching frequently between espresso and filter range - I know there are after market products to remedy this but I'm not super convinced to the idea.  Second concern is that James Hoffman didn't seem to be super impressed with the other Eureka in his video (but considering what machines he operates with I can be still satisfied with the Zero). 

Thanks in advance for any input and have a great espresso today!",4,1742041804.0,espresso,3,0.84,False

1jbty3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jbty3n/aitah_for_sleeping_with_other_people_until_my/,AITAH for sleeping with other people until my boyfriend said he loved me?,"I (23f) have been dating my boyfriend (26m) for just over an year and feel terrible that I was still seeing other people until the day he said he loved me. 

I broke up with my ex of 4 years in October 2023 and moved to a new city in December 2023. Looking to meet new people (and have a bit of fun being single) I got on the apps and matched with a strikingly handsome man on Tinder. We matched the day before I left for a 3 week long holiday and continued texting while I was away. Once I got back he asked to go on a date. 

We went to a local favourite, had a few drinks and had great conversation. All in all, it was a lovely first date which finished with a sweet kiss. We planned our next date for the following weekend for lunch and having a look around a new precinct that had opened in our city. On this date we picked up right where we left off and after lunch as we were walking out he casually slipped his hand to hold mine while we walked to look at the new area. Shared a few more kisses and had a bit of a make-out when we sat by the river that afternoon for an afternoon coffee. Another very nice date and he walked me back to my car and I drove home. 

Now at this point, I had arranged to go on another first date the day after. I really liked my time with my now boyfriend (let's call him Brad) and was slowly getting to know him but I wanted to keep my options open and not put my eggs in one basket after just getting out of a 5 year long unhappy relationship. And so I went on the second first date with ""Frank"". Had a nice date with ""Frank"" but still kept thinking about my time with ""Brad"". 

Brad and I planned our third date for a hike and dinner after, we may have hinted that dinner would be at Brad's place under the guise of having a relaxing afternoon where he was going to introduce me to a show I hadn't watched. Hike went really well and we drove back to Brad's place separately. Went in and watched an episode of the show before we eventually ended up with our hands all over each other. After getting hot and heavy we went out for dinner and I left not long after. 

Now, in the week following, I get a message from ""Tim"" who I had been with before my ex and he now lives in this new city as well. He invites me to a football game and I say I'd love to go and catch up. We go to the game and I end up back at his that night and we end up sleeping with each other. 

This continues for about 2 months where I'm going on dates with all three men, I absolutely know that both Frank and Tim are casual hookups and fun dates. Around this time  was when I started developing real feelings for Brad but was still under the impression that we were still seeing where things are going. To this day we have never had an official ""will you date me/what are we"" conversation. Have I mentioned that I still find Brad incredibly attractive and feel like I'm punching way above my weight. I had talked to my girl friends and they said to keep my options open and so I did. 

I now felt I was in a classic situationship with Brad, we haven't discussed where we stand, we hookup, don't really talk about our feelings, have fun dates. I don't know if he's seeing other people but I do know that he's still on the apps so I assume we're not exclusive. 

Fast forward to July, it's now been 5 months of seeing all 3 men and I go through a rough patch with a few things and Brad opens up and becomes a massive support through this week. I now decide to stop seeing Frank and Tim. Brad and I still haven't discussed if we're exclusively dating but I now don't want to be seeing anyone else. 

In September, we were having a lazy day and he was being silly and made a joke about how he would love me even if I took away all his favourite food (I was scolding him for finishing up the batch of cookies I baked for him on the day I made them when they were meant to last the entire week). Earlier on that same day he made the comment ""who am I trying to impress, I already have a girlfriend"" and that was the first time he ever explicitly said that I was in fact his girlfriend. 

We have now celebrated our first anniversary together. We say our anniversary is on the day we had our first date and now I feel guilty because I was seeing other people all through this time last year until July. And so I ask, AITAH? ",0,1742041465.0,AITAH,35,0.45,False
