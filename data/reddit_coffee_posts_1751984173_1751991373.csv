1lusr2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1lusr2e/am_i_the_ascon_for_opting_to_not_participate_in/,Am I the Ascon for opting to not participate in my step son‚Äôs move to college?,"I (41 f) have been married for 10 years, together for 12 with husband (46m). We both brought a child into the relationship, my son who is 2 years older than his son. 
To say there has been difficulties blending the family is an understatement. He spoils his, I have boundaries. He never disciplines, I taught mine accountability and responsibility. I have been treated like someone who is primarily there as his kids nanny and told not to parent his child at all. My husband has also had battles with addictions off and on and had been verbally and emotionally abusive throughout the relationship. So his son has heard the horrible things said. Almost 2 years ago it came to a head and I left him and created boundaries that he agreed to stick to if I agreed to give the marriage one last chance. The boys are older, mine has moved out and is in college and his just graduated. We have had full custody of his son for 11 years. I have handled all appointments, coming, care taking etc for his son and do love him very much.  His son however has battled drug addiction for 4 years and now is sneaking alcohol into the house as well. He is almost 18, over 6‚Äô tall and has melt downs. Meltdowns that are almost toddler like. He is supposed to be saving money for his move to college in a few weeks, but he‚Äôs lied about paychecks and his money so he can spend it and has an expectation that daddy will just cover like he always has. My husband asked me to get his bank info so he could log into his account and manage it. I was home, my husband was at work, so I thought sure, he knows he‚Äôs supposed to give it to his dad shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. 
Oh my gosh. He instantly had attitude with me, threw himself on his bed in a tantrum, screamed at me for how I don‚Äôt as always ruining his life and how much he effing hated me, has always hated me, how everyone hates me, standing over me demanding I get out of HIS room, leave him alone to live his life and to stop treating him like a toddler - I was floored. I reminded him it was his home but it‚Äôs my house, I won‚Äôt be disrespected in my house. If he doesn‚Äôt know his bank info to hand over his phone and I would get it. He crossed his arms and said no. I texted his dad on a group chat that his son was refusing to give bank info then flipped my camera on to record. For 4 minutes, he screamed again how much he effing hated me and got in my face. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs 6‚Äô2. 

His dad has never believed me when I said his son screams at me and is hateful, he only sees the side of his son acting like a victim. 

He texted his dad I had been screaming at him all
Morning (not knowing I was only at home on my lunch break because he was sleeping) and that I was calling him names and cursing at him. 

I sent the video to my husband, my husband was apologetic but then didn‚Äôt say anything to his son. He only said I‚Äôm not going to help him prep or pack for his move. He didn‚Äôt defend me, he didn‚Äôt say anything about the video that shows his son screaming in my face and cursing at me. He has been acting almost baby like with his son. 

I told him, when we move him down to college, I will take a train down and get picked up by my son, and stay at his apartment which is only 20 minutes from where his son will be. We had a hotel booked for the 3 of us, and I told my husband I would just stay with my son and keep our dog with me during the day so he could help his son get set up with school. His son is staying in the hotel the whole time so I won‚Äôt be. He said that‚Äôs fine.

But two days later I mentioned it again and he was flabbergasted that I was (in his words) actually going through with that. He tried turning it to I was choosing to not see him when we go down there and tried to guilt me into relenting. I told him no, I told him that expecting me to cave on my boundaries for him when he couldn‚Äôt even defend me to his son or tell his son his behavior was not acceptable was not choosing me. I told him I would love for him to come get me in the morning from my sons apartment and he and I can do coffee and beach walks in the mornings for the couple days we are there, but he should also be focusing on the last few days he has with his son before we go home to an empty house. 

I know he‚Äôs going to keep pushing this over the next few weeks, but am I the ascon for actually choosing to not participate in anything related with his son moving forward? ",1,1751991245.0,dustythunder,0,1.0,False

Let me know if you guys want to hear some other ones,"I have been living in the same house since I was 6 years old. It is an old farm house built in 1848. There is no documented history on our home, for unknown reasons.
Around 2010 my mothers friend came to our house around 6:00pm, to wait for her husband to get home from work (her husband worked for my dads company, and they would come back to my house to close up shop for the night). My mother was on her way home, so my moms friend thought she would just wait near the house and have a coffee and smoke while she waits for her husband and my mom to get home so they can have some drinks together. 
While she was waiting there, she said she looked up towards my barn (which is about 4 acres away from my home, in the field). Then she looked back at her phone, then realized she thought she saw someone. She looked back up and noticed a man, dressed all in black, wearing a long trench coat with ‚Äúno face‚Äù. She watched him walking for at least 10 seconds, then looked away, when she looked back for the second time he was gone. 
She didn‚Äôt wait for her husband or my mother to get there, she didn‚Äôt even take her coffee and smokes, she left everything and didn‚Äôt come back to my house for months. She said she‚Äôs never felt so scared in her entire life. ",1,1751991186.0,TrueScaryStories,0,1.0,False

1lusogv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lusogv/does_the_shardor_km802g_coffee_maker_review/,Does the SHARDOR KM802G Coffee Maker Review Reveal Perfect Brews for Every Cup?,"**A Coffee Maker Worth the Hype: SHARDOR KM802G Hot & Iced K Cup Coffee Maker**  

Life is better with a good cup of coffee, isn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôs why I decided to test the SHARDOR KM802G Hot & Iced K Cup Coffee Maker. With its promise of both hot and iced coffee options, a bold brew setting, and versatility compatible with K-pods and ground coffee, this machine piqued my interest. After weeks of putting it through its paces, I‚Äôve got insights to share‚Äîboth the highlights and the quirks.  

**Design That Fits Modern Kitchens**  
The first thing I noticed upon unboxing was its sleek and compact design. Dark gray with a modern style, it feels less like a clunky appliance and more like a polished addition to my counter. Measuring 11.46‚Äù x 11.93‚Äù x 5.28‚Äù, it fits snugly even in tight spaces. I loved the detachable drip tray, which made cleaning spills‚Äîor fitting my mammoth travel mug‚Äîso much easier.  

**Functionality for Every Coffee Enthusiast**  
Testing this coffee maker‚Äôs versatility was a treat; it's amazing for people like me who like to switch up their brew. I tried K-pods, ground coffee, and even tea, thanks to the included reusable filter and capsule holder. The five brewing capacities (6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 oz) ensured the right amount of coffee every time, whether I needed a quick pick-me-up or enough for a long morning.  

**Winning Points**  
- **Strength Selection:** Bold setting gave my iced coffee the kind of rich flavor that didn‚Äôt water down over ice.  
- **Large Water Reservoir:** The 52 oz removable tank meant fewer refills, which was a blessing during hectic mornings.  
- **Fast Brewing:** It churned out hot or iced coffee in about a minute. Time-saving, anyone?  

[Check SHARDOR KM802G price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0drbm88h3/)

**Performance That Delivers Every Morning**  
I‚Äôm not morning-friendly, but this machine definitely helped. Its fully automatic operation was super intuitive. Even my groggy self struggled to mess up the process. Iced coffee came out fresh without tasting over-extracted, and its brewing speed kept me on schedule. Plus, shutting off automatically five minutes after brewing? Total energy efficiency bonus.  

**Drawbacks I Noticed**  
- **Plastic Taste Initially:** I had to run a couple of cleaning cycles to get rid of a faint plastic smell.  
- **Not the Quietest:** Brewing was a bit noisy, which might bother you if you have light-sleeping kids in the house.  

**Additional Settings to Love**  
Adjustability played a big role in the product‚Äôs daily use. Thanks to the removable drip tray, cleaning was much easier, and I could fit cups of all heights. This feature is particularly helpful if you‚Äôre always on the go with a travel mug like me. And let‚Äôs not forget the energy-saving auto-off‚Äîideal when you‚Äôre in a rush to leave home.

**Competing Products**  
Stacking this against competitors, I‚Äôd say it holds its ground confidently. Machines like the Keurig K-Classic have similar features but lack the iced-coffee option. Meanwhile, more premium models like the Keurig K-Elite might be quieter but come with a heftier price tag. Where this model excels is the 3-in-1 compatibility‚ÄîK-pods, grounds, and tea. The bold setting isn‚Äôt offered on many machines in this price range, either, which makes it a standout for strong coffee fans.  

**Financial Value**  
It offers strong usability for its price, delivering a mix of premium functionality without a premium price. If you‚Äôre comparing costs with high-end coffee makers, this one strikes a great balance between affordability and quality. While the occasional buzzing sound during brewing might not make it ‚Äúluxurious,‚Äù everything it does offer at its price feels worth it.

**Looking to optimize your health or performance with Theacrine?** This guide breaks down everything you need to know about this popular purine alkaloid commonly used as a stimulant and nootropic, from its benefits and dosage to the latest research and biohacker insights.

---

## What is Theacrine?
Theacrine is a purine alkaloid found naturally in certain tea leaves, particularly *Camellia kucha*, and coffee. It is structurally similar to caffeine and produces similar effects, though often reported as smoother and longer-lasting.

---

## Key Potential Benefits & Uses
Based on research and biohacker experiences, **Theacrine** is often used for:

- **Energy and Alertness**: Helps reduce feelings of fatigue and promotes wakefulness.
- **Improved Focus and Concentration**: May enhance cognitive function and attention span.
- **Mood Enhancement**: Can potentially elevate mood and reduce stress perceptions.
- **Reduced Perceived Exertion**: May make physical activity feel less demanding.
- **Adaptation**: Research suggests less tolerance development compared to caffeine over time.
- **Mechanism**: Works by influencing adenosine and dopamine receptors in the brain.

---

## Scientific Evidence: What Does the Research Say?
- **Summary of Evidence**: Studies indicate Theacrine can improve energy, focus, and mood, with effects comparable to or synergistic with caffeine. Some research points towards its potential for reduced tolerance compared to caffeine with regular use.
- **Strength of Evidence**: Moderate/Emerging. While human studies exist showing efficacy, more large-scale, long-term trials are needed to fully understand all effects and mechanisms.

---

## How to Take Theacrine
- **Common Forms**: Powder, Capsules.
- **Typical Dosage**: 50-200mg per day. Start with a lower dose to assess tolerance. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
- **Timing**: Often taken in the morning for general energy or 30-60 minutes before a workout or demanding cognitive task.

---

## Synergies & Stacking
- **Theacrine** is often stacked with Caffeine for enhanced energy and focus, or with L-Theanine to smooth out potential jitters.

---

## Potential Side Effects & Precautions
Like any supplement, **Theacrine** may cause side effects, though they are typically dose-dependent. These can include:

- **Restlessness**: May cause difficulty relaxing, especially at higher doses.
- **Increased Heart Rate**: Can potentially elevate heart rate, similar to caffeine.
- **Headache**: Possible, particularly with higher doses or sensitive individuals.
- **Precautions**: Individuals sensitive to stimulants should use caution. Avoid high doses, especially when combined with other stimulants. Consult a doctor if pregnant, breastfeeding, or have pre-existing heart conditions or anxiety disorders.

---

## Choosing the Right Form & Quality
- **Quality Tips**: Look for third-party tested products to verify purity and dosage. Ensure the product specifies the amount of pure Theacrine (often as Teacrine¬Æ or similar branded forms).

---

## Biohacker Insights & Community Experiences
- **Common Experiences**: Many users report a clean, smooth energy boost with less of a ""crash"" compared to caffeine alone. Some find it useful for extended focus sessions or as a caffeine alternative or potentiator.
- **Pro Tip**: Combining Theacrine with L-Theanine can create a balanced stimulant effect, reducing potential anxiety or jitters while maintaining focus.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
- **Is Theacrine just like caffeine?**
  - **Answer**: While structurally similar and having overlapping effects (energy, focus), Theacrine is often reported to have a smoother onset, longer duration, and importantly, less potential for tolerance build-up compared to caffeine.
- **Does tolerance build to Theacrine?**
  - **Answer**: Unlike caffeine, research suggests that tolerance to Theacrine's effects may be minimal or non-existent with regular use, making it a potentially more sustainable option for daily energy and focus.

I'm relatively new here and only found the forum a few days ago. But I'm very glad that I did find it.

I wanted to describe my symptoms and, if necessary, collect first-hand stories from you guys. Like many here, I have typical symptoms of GERD and/or silent reflux.

\- Pressure in the upper abdomen

\- A lump in the throat

\- Feeling of discomfort when bending over 

These usually occur on an empty stomach or after large, fatty meals. So far so good, I can deal with it to some extent.

The worst of all symptoms and the one that scares me the most and where i could use some advice is a short stinging sensation in the centre of my chest. I have successfully (yay me) used a finger pulse monitor to see that the stinging is a skip in my heartbeat. This has caused me extreme panic and leads to me getting into a kind of vicious cycle where I focus very much on my heartbeat and then feel it strongly throughout my body.

I've now realised that it only happens when I drink coffee with caffeine. It doesn't happen with coffee without caffeine, I only get the normal symptoms of a sore throat and so on. At least thats why i belive for now.

I have now done the self-test for two weeks. No coffee at all for two weeks, no cola or anything else that contains caffeine. No stinging, nothing. Then after two weeks I drank a cup of normal coffee and within an hour I had a skip in my heartbeat.

What i did so far to battle the condition is to lose waight (30KG in about 12 months), stopped drinking coffee with caffeine, stopped vaping 2 weeks ago and at the same time started to drink kefir twice a day. So far the only thing that made it stop is to stop drinking coffee.",1,1751990375.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a side project I‚Äôve been poking at for the last six months or so (weekends and late nights only‚Äîshout out to coffee ‚òï). The idea was simple: can you really adapt a big Vision Transformer (like DeiT-Base) by just tweaking a tiny sliver of its weights?

¬†

**What‚Äôs the trick?**

* **Freeze \~99 % of DeiT-Base.**
* Insert¬†**LoRA adapters**¬†*only*¬†in the Q/K/V projections (the attention blocks).
* Assign each adapter its own rank via a three-signal score:
   1. **Fisher information**¬†‚Äì layer importance
   2. **Gradient norm**¬†‚Äì learning signal strength
   3. **Output covariance**¬†‚Äì activation diversity
* Train¬†**only**¬†those adapters + the classifier head; everything else stays locked.

¬†

**How did it do?**

On CIFAR-100, just training 198k out of 86 million parameters (\~0.23%) gave me 89.2% test accuracy.

Full fine-tuning got me 90.2% (that‚Äôs the whole model, 30 epochs, much slower).

Each run took \~48 minutes on an L40S GPU‚Äîway faster and lighter.

Predictions are still reliable: ECE (calibration) actually looked better than my full model after temp scaling.

For reference, the best reported DeiT-Base on CIFAR-100 is 90.8% (per Papers With Code).

¬†

**Why bother?**

It‚Äôs honestly wild how much accuracy you can keep while saving a ton on compute and memory.

This was a ‚Äúlearn-by-doing‚Äù thing‚Äîno secret sauce, just basic PyTorch + a few libraries, and a lot of trial and error.

If you‚Äôre looking to run big models on less hardware, maybe this helps or sparks an idea.

¬†

**A few notes:**

It‚Äôs only tested on CIFAR-10/100 for now. Would genuinely love feedback, ideas, or suggestions for what else to try

1lus854,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lus854/explore_primula_classic_stovetop_espresso_maker/,Explore Primula Classic Stovetop Espresso Maker Review Does It Truly Rival Cafe-Brewed Coffee?,"The **Primula Classic Stovetop Espresso and Coffee Maker** has been my trusty coffee companion for about a month now, and I‚Äôve tested it every single day since unboxing. Designed to brew rich, authentic espresso and Cuban coffee, this moka pot is compact, sturdy, and refreshingly simple to use. It promises to deliver twelve perfect demitasse servings with every use, and let me tell you‚Äîit certainly doesn‚Äôt disappoint when it comes to flavor. However, as with any product, it has its quirks, so let‚Äôs dive into the nitty-gritty of this caffeinated contraption.

**Crafted for Durability and Design**  
The first thing that stood out to me was how solid this coffee maker feels in the hand. Made from cast aluminum, it has a natural finish that complements its classic design. The material not only makes it lightweight but also ensures that heat is distributed evenly, which, as I learned after brewing my first pot, significantly enhances the coffee‚Äôs aroma and taste. The flip-top lid is incredibly convenient, and the heat-resistant handle and knob make pouring safe and easy, even when the moka pot is piping hot. While the silver exterior is attractive, I did worry about long-term discoloration, but so far, it has held up well.

**Ease of Use is Unmatched**  
I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that this moka pot simplifies the coffee-making process to an art. All you need to do is pour water into the lower chamber, fill the filter with ground coffee, and place it on your stovetop. Within just a few minutes, the top chamber fills with bubbling, aromatic espresso. As someone who has had my fair share of overly complicated electric espresso machines that take up half the counter, this streamlined process feels downright luxurious. If you‚Äôre someone who likes their morning routine quick and straightforward, this moka pot is a total win.

[Ready to snag Primula Primula? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00384ivq0/)

**Versatility in Brewing**  
With this coffee maker, I‚Äôve crafted everything from Cuban coffee to a creamy latte. It can handle espresso, Americanos, and even cappuccinos, making it a surprisingly versatile tool for such a compact device. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of strong, bold Italian brews or prefer something lighter with milk, this moka pot fits the bill. I even used it during a weekend camping trip, where it worked seamlessly over a propane stovetop‚Äîturns out, this moka pot is more portable than I originally gave it credit for.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning this device couldn‚Äôt be simpler. After each use, I just rinse it under warm water and let it dry completely before reassembling. However, be careful not to use soap, as it can affect the pot‚Äôs interior coating‚Äîit‚Äôs a common tip among moka pot enthusiasts that I‚Äôm glad I heeded. My only gripe is that the aluminum exterior can retain water spots if not dried immediately, but this is a minor nitpick for an otherwise straightforward cleaning process.

**Highlights**  
- Durable cast aluminum design ensures even heat distribution.  
- Effortless to use and brews delicious coffee in minutes.  
- Works on all stovetops, including electric, gas, ceramic, and propane.  
- Compact size makes it great for home kitchens and on-the-go.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Aluminum construction might discolor over time with heavy use.  
- Requires manual cleaning and immediate drying to avoid water spots.  
- Produces espresso only‚Äîno options for regular drip coffee enthusiasts.  

**Product Comparisons with Industry Competitors**  
When comparing this product to other moka pots, such as the Bialetti Moka Express, the Primula model holds its own remarkably well. While the Bialetti is a crowd-favorite due to decades of branding, it comes with a higher price tag and offers a similar brewing experience. The Primula Classic Stovetop Espresso Maker delivers identical results at a more wallet-friendly price point. On the downside, I noticed that the Primula‚Äôs exterior doesn‚Äôt feel quite as polished as the Bialetti‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker. Another strong contender in this category is the Grosche Milano, which boasts a more ergonomic handle but lacks the broader size options that Primula offers.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of cost-to-quality ratio, this moka pot is a fantastic deal for what you get. Its durable build, ease of use, and ability to craft exceptional coffee make it a worthy investment for anyone serious about espresso at home. While it lacks some of the bells and whistles of electric models, that‚Äôs precisely the appeal for purists‚Äîno complicated settings and no ongoing costs like specialty pods or filters.

\- replacement housewares, health / hygiene items, shoes / socks / undies  
I spent more in this category than expected because I had to replace a few things at home, but they were necessary. Also bought a few packs of undies because I got lazy about laundry in the winter (I go to a laundromat).  
Scored 2 pairs of sneakers second hand. I didn't technically need to replace when I bought them, but they were unique purchases. I already went through one pair and will start using the second when the weather's colder. For now, I've been rocking a pair of cheap summer flats I bought last year.

\- replacement clothes and bags - MUST be thrifted / second hand  
Did great here and decluttered or repurposed (to rags) way more than I bought. I scored 3 shirts and 2 bags at Buffalo Exchange (same place I got the sneakers). I don't plan on buying any more clothes or bags this year (or next!) I have too many clothes and would love to eventually pair it down to a capsule wardrobe.

\- movie / museum tickets - I only bought 1 movie ticket over the winter. probably won't go back

\- snacks out = OK, any meals out must be with friends. No Starbucks or coffee drinks.  
This was a bit of a fail because I ended up putting $10 on the Starbucks app because I was so close to getting a free drink (and did). BUT....I also used the last few bucks on the physical card before closing the account recently :D  
I don't generally go to Dunkin anymore, but a bad kitchen sink clog earlier in the year left me unable to make coffee. So I went to Dunkin a handful of times. Also went back a few times during the recent heatwave. I decided to occasionally allow iced coffee as a ""snack"" but I still almost always make coffee at home.  
Otherwise I've only had meals out with friends and only bought ice cream and other snacks out a few times. It's kind of expensive so it's a very occasional treat.

\- No Amazon (except for Fresh)  
I added this later in the year and happy to say I stuck with it. Any housewares I bought on Amazon in the past were a waste of money. 1) Online shopping makes it hard to tell when the quality sucks and 2) spending a certain amount for free shipping forces you to buy more than you need at a time.

\- replacement phone / laptop (if needed)  
My phone is on its last leg and I plan on getting a dumbphone / switching to a cheaper / prepaid phone plan later this month. Laptop is still truckin.",16,1751990022.0,minimalism,3,1.0,False

1lus2ky,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1lus2ky/is_this_just_a_slowburn_or_am_i_forcing_something/,Is this just a slowburn or am I forcing something that‚Äôs not there?,"Problem/Goal: I‚Äôve been dating this guy for 3 months, but I‚Äôm not sure if I should continue or just end things now. 

Context: I (25F) have been dating this guy (29M) for about 3 months now. I‚Äôve been on a few dates before, but nothing ever turned into a relationship. This time, we were set up by my close friend. He messaged me first, and I responded since I was open to meeting someone at that time. 

Before we started dating, sinabi na sa akin ng close friend ko ‚Äòyung past niya‚Äîhe cheated on his ex. They used to live together, broke up, and now he‚Äôs back living with his parents. He doesn‚Äôt know that I already know this. Still, I decided to give it a shot, thinking na okay lang naman kasi past na niya ‚Äòyon. Tbh, he‚Äôs not my usual type (I usually go for TDH, iykyk lol), but I gave in to some peer pressure, my friends would tell me to start dating and exploring kasi tumatanda na kami, kaya nag-go na ako. 

We‚Äôve gone on a lot of dates‚Äîhindi ko na maalala kung ilan na within 3 months. But as I got to know him, I realized he‚Äôs mature, sweet, and very understanding. I admire how passionate he is about his work. 

He‚Äôs talked about his ex and why they broke up, but his version always felt a bit incomplete. Kahit na alam kong nag-cheat siya, I never brought it up‚Äîuntil our last date. We were talking about cheating, and I casually asked him if he had ever cheated on any of his exes. He paused and tried to change the subject. I asked him again, and instead of giving me a clear answer, he asked me, ‚ÄúWhat if kung nag-cheat nga ako?‚Äù 

I told him honestly that it‚Äôs his past, and it doesn‚Äôt change how I feel (at least not completely). I also said I hope he‚Äôs learned from it and asked what he would do differently this time. He said something like he already has plans and that he‚Äôs ready to settle down. But honestly, it wasn‚Äôt the answer I was hoping for. I was waiting for something more sincere or reassuring like ‚ÄúHindi ko magagawa ‚Äòyun sayo‚Äù. So I felt a bit disappointed. 

I like him, but I don‚Äôt feel fully comfortable or trusting yet. Maybe because of my avoidant attachment style too. When we‚Äôre together, I enjoy his company, I show affection, and I felt a connection with him. But when we‚Äôre apart, I don‚Äôt really miss him or look forward to seeing him again. Even though we‚Äôve had some physical intimacy (we kissed, we made out), my feelings don‚Äôt seem to go deeper. Hindi ko alam kung bored lang ba ako or what. 

Early on, I made it clear to him that he had to court me properly if he really wanted to pursue something serious, but he didn‚Äôt ask me directly if he can court me, or tell me that he is courting me. I started to feel like he wasn‚Äôt really putting in the effort. Most of our dates are just coffee near my place‚Äîit‚Äôs convenient for both of us since it‚Äôs also on his way to work, but there‚Äôs barely any planning or thought behind it. I wish na he would do more to show that he really wants to win me over. Pero hindi ko masabi sakanya ‚Äòto, because I don‚Äôt want to come off as demanding. He also mentioned before that he‚Äôs tight on budget. 

During our last date, sinabi niya na he was worried that knowing his past might affect how I see him. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt even know how I feel anymore‚Ä¶ üò≠ He keeps asking me to go out for 2 weeks since our last date, but I‚Äôve been declining kasi pagod sa work at gusto ko nalang matulog pag-uwi. He would say he understands, but I still feel guilty for turning him down.

A part of me wonders‚Äîmaybe this is just a slowburn? Should I give it more time and really get to know him, or am I just forcing it?

Please do not post it elsewhere. ",1,1751989686.0,adviceph,2,0.67,False
1lus1ub,https://i.redd.it/h2ka0msk8obf1.png,Sims 4 Mod Manager ‚Äì CC without pictures = broken?,"Hi everyone,  
I have a quick question about the Sims 4 Mod Manager.

A lot of my custom content (CC) doesn‚Äôt show a picture in the manager, so I can‚Äôt really tell what it is. I‚Äôve been thinking about cleaning up my Mods folder because I have so much CC, and I don‚Äôt actually use most of it.

The thing is, I‚Äôve been getting frequent *LastException* errors in the game, and I‚Äôm starting to suspect that some of my CC might be broken or outdated.

So here‚Äôs my question:  
Does it mean that a CC file is broken if it doesn‚Äôt show a picture in the Sims 4 Mod Manager? Or is that normal for certain types of CC?

I was thinking about deleting all the CC that shows no picture, but I‚Äôm worried I might accidentally delete some of my favorite items, since I can‚Äôt tell what they are.

Any advice or tips would be super appreciated! üòä

Thanks in advance!",1,1751989639.0,sims4cc,3,0.67,False

1lus0g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lus0g0/aitah_for_not_telling_this_girl_im_trans/,AITAH for not telling this girl I'm trans?,"I (32FTM) have been medically transitioning for over a decade. I never wanted to state I was trans to people I barely know and refrained from dating for this reason. I usually keep to myself at work and bother nobody. I started my job two years ago and nobody expect for my boss knows I'm trans. I don't talk to anyone unless spoken to first because I'm just that type of person.

I work as a cashier at a supermarket. About six months ago, we got a new coworker, ""Brenda"" (F30, fake name). Almost from day one, Brenda started trying to flirt with me and asking me out. I quickly shut that shit down and said bluntly I will never date her. I didn‚Äôt give a reason because I didn't feel like it was her business to know I was trans.

That didn't deter her. She kept asking. Every shift, it was her asking to grab coffee or saying that we'd be a good couple.
It got to the point where she'd wait for me after my shift, or find reasons to come to my register when I had customers. The only reason I didn't do anything was because I didn't want to start drama, or get her fired because she was objectively nice otherwise. So I kept rejecting her again and again so it didn't look like I was leading her on. I also tried my best to avoid her as well but I never stated I was trans.

Then, about a week ago, I was on the phone with my mom talking about my transition, I honestly don't remember what I exactly said since I talk a lot on the phone with my mom lol. I think that's when Brenda figured out I was trans because that was the only time I brought it up in the last month and no coworkers knew.

When she came to work she started shrieking. Brenda was talking about how I have been ""tricking"" her and ""lying"" to her this whole time.

I might have been a bit mean and said I wasn't lying about shit because I was still a man and I never wanted to date her so she had nothing to worry about. And said it wasn't her business. Brenda agrued I ""lied by omission,"" and how she felt ""backstabbed"" because she had wasted her time on a ""l*sbo"" with a ""pussy"".

I was done at that point. I went straight to HR, laid out everything, the repeated date requests after I explicitly rejected her, her hovering, and finally, her outburst about my gender. HR took it seriously because it was ""discrimination and harassment"" And Brenda was fired just yesterday.

Now all my coworkers are giving me the silent treatment and looking at me weird. They won't even acknowledge me at all except for this one lesbain women in her 40's. She said that what I did bordered on sexual assault because I didn't tell her I was trans. I was really worried because I thought I told her enough times I wasn't interested even after all the pestering. I just didn't want people I wasn't close with to know my history but now I feel gross.

Chapter 1: Gunner

I watched as the house across the street had been sold. I sure hope it does not have a bunch of teenage girls. I don't need that kind of shit, and neither do my members. I watched as a woman and for boys all well over 6 feet, 4 inches or more tall got out of the cars. Then I noticed the Indian motorcycle pulled up and parked behind a truck.  
  
My VP and I watched as a small boy got off. Then our mouths dropped open. It was a girl whos hair flew down her back, past her hips as she took off her helmet. We heard one of the boys yell something and she ran over and jumped into his arms. She is short, very, short. But I am looking at the older woman. She has dark red hair that flows down her back to her hips. She is about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with long legs.  
  
As we watched them walk around the property we heard the boys talking about how much land came with it. And there were two three car garages. And a huge metal building in the back. We sat watching to see what happened next. Sure enough the for sale sign was removed.  
  
We watched as the older woman and one of the older boys got into the truck and headed to town. Just then the bigger boys grabbed the girl and started tossing her back and forth. We heard them yelling she had to agree to something. I heard her yell ""fuck you guys."" They stood her on her feet and crossed their arms. Looking down at her.  
  
The started yelling at her and I laughed as she just stood there and glared at them. She showed no fear of them. ""Dam that little girl is a spitfire"" I said looking at my VP. My VP is a 24 year old man that loves pussy. My VP's name is Ripper. He looked at me laughing. ""She is a handful isn't she?"" The we really laughed as she walked away giving them the finger.  
  
I was so pissed at my brothers. I just turned 18 and will graduate from high school this year. My brothers rang from 25,24,23,22, and 20. Ace is 25, Turk, is 24, Panther is 23, Racer is 22, and Fist is 20. Mom stopped having kids after I came along. My dad died in a bar fight trying to protect my mother.  
  
My dad's brother is the president of the Wild Eagle MC. of Lima, Ohio. His name is Hunter. He told mom about this house. Mom sold our house and decided to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Celina, Ohio. I sit down on the porch and lit a joint.  
  
I looked up and saw the moving truck pull into the driveway. I walked into the house and looked at all the bedrooms. I turned left at the top of the stairs. I walked down the hallway and opened the door. This is my room, it has its own bathroom.  
  
""I opened the window and yelled down that they better pick their bedrooms because this one is mine.""  
  
They can't argue with that because this one is purple. A girls room. I heard them running toward the room I was in. My brothers were yelling they want this one until they walked in and saw the walls are purple.  
  
""Fuck that"" they said. They all turned and started looking around until they all had picked the rooms they wanted. My bed was up and the boxes stacked against the wall. I made my bed, then started hanging my clothes in the closet. Then I put them in the dresser.  
  
My desk was against the wall next to the door. I had everything unpacked and turned my radio on. Then I climbed out my window and sat on he roof.  
  
I looked up and saw her sitting on the roof. She couldn't be more than 18. I heard one of her brothers yelling at her to get off the roof. I caught my breath as she walked to the edge and looked down at him.  
  
Granted it could not be more than 5 or 10 feet off the ground. But she could fall and hurt herself. Knight Rider MC  
  
""Do you really want me off the roof Ace."" She asked.  
  
""Get off before you fall.""  
  
I watched as she sat on the edge of the roof. Then she jumped off.  
  
""Fuck,"" I said standing up. Then I saw him catch her.  
  
""Will you stop doing that Star.""  
  
""One of these days you are gong to get hurt.""  
  
I heard her laugh and my breath caught in my throat. It was beautiful. I saw another brother walk out on the porch and he said, ""Mom just called."" She is on her way home with groceries. She will need help unloading them.  
  
She also said she had some news for us. We turned as mom pulled into the driveway and parked. We all started carrying groceries into the house. We started putting them away.  
  
Turk asked. ""What is your news mom?""  
  
""I got a job at the nursing home down the road.""  
  
""I will be the nurse in charge and work the morning shift.""  
  
""There is a nursing assistant position open on the second shift.""  
  
""I brought you an application home, Star.""  
  
""You can work after school. Here is the application."" I start in two days. I can take your application in when I go to work. I took it to my room, filled it out then gave it back to my mom.  
  
""I am going to park my bike in the big shed out back. I said walking out the door. I walked over sat on my bike and started it. Then I started it and rode around the cars and trucks to the back yard.  
  
I drove it into the building parked it, shut it off and got off walking out of the building. I walked over to my mustang and parked it in the garage. I then walked back into the house.

Chapter 2: Brandy

I am the mother of four boys and one daughter. I am a nurse and I just moved my family to Celina, Ohio. My husband was killed last year in a bar protecting me. I needed to move from Fort Wayne, Indiana. I moved to a nice town with a lake. It is not a big town but that is what I wanted for my kids. I moved across the street from the Knight Rider MC.  
  
I heard a knock on the front door. I opened it large, tall man wearing a cut standing there. I opened the door and ""asked if I could help him.""  
  
""I want to introduce myself. My name is Gunner and I am the president of the club across the street.""  
  
""We are having a BBQ this weekend and would like to invite you and your family over. It starts at 7:00 pm.""  
  
""My name is Brandy, Thank you, we will be there.""  
  
I watched as he walked down the porch steps. That was nice of him. I told the boys were invited to the BBQ. Star is not home so I will tell her in the morning. I got home at 1:00 Am. Everyone was in bed. I walked into my room and put my money in a lock box. I made $25,000 tonight. I took a shower and went to bed. I have school in the morning.  
  
I got up and dressed for school. I made me coffee and cereal. I put my bowl in the dishwasher before walking out and getting into my car. I drove to the high school and parked my car. I walked to the office and got my schedule. After school I walked to my car and drove home. Again no one was home when I walked in.  
  
I made me a sandwich and coffee before I walked up stairs to my room where I changed into shorts and a tee-shirt. I ate my sandwich and drank my coffee before I completed my homework. We have been here almost a week now. Tomarrow is Saturday. I wonder what mom has planned.  
  
It seems my brothers have all planned to stay at the club across the street. They are hardly at home anymore. I miss Panther. He moved to Florida a week ago. He is the president of his own MC now. I walked down stairs and saw my brothers in the living room.  
  
""What are we all doing tomarrow?""  
  
We don't know about you, but we have all been invited to a BBQ across the street.  
  
""What do you mean, you don't know about me?""  
  
""I wasn't invited?""  
  
""Mom didn't mention you.""  
  
""Oh, Ok,"" I said getting up and walking out the front door to sit on the porch. I felt a tear slide down my face. I was not invited to attend the BBQ. How could mom do that? It was not fair that I was not invited and they would go without me. I watched as mom and the boys started out the door.  
  
I said. ""Mom how could you go over there when I was not invited.""  
  
I than ran out the door got on my bike and drove out of the driveway and down the road.  
  
""What did she mean by that Ace.""  
  
""Well, you told us boys that you and we were invited.""  
  
""You didn't mention Star, so we told her she was not invited.""  
  
I drove to the restaurant in town and parked my bike. I saw a girl come out and get on her bike.  
  
""Hey, didn't you move into the house across the street from our club?""  
  
""Yes, why do you ask?""  
  
""Aren't you coming to the BBQ?""  
  
""I was not invited.""  
  
""My brothers said that just them and my mom was.""  
  
""That can't be right, my brother would not do that.""  
  
""Well apparently he did."" I said turning and walking into the restaurant and ordered food. I looked out the window and saw it was getting dark so I got on my bike and rode home.  
  
I saw them walk into the club but I did not see the girl. Where is she? Introductions were made and I asked.  
  
""Where is your daughter?""  
  
""She was not invited.""  
  
""Wait, What?""  
  
""Of course, she was.""  
  
""Fuck."" I heard her brothers say.  
  
""We didn't think she was because she is not 21.""  
  
""Of course, she was invited. This is a family BBQ.""  
  
""She left the house when we told hers she was not invited.""  
  
I was pissed that Gunner did not include that girl in the invitation. I walked in the club slamming the door.  
  
""How the fuck could you do that Gunner?""  
  
""What?""  
  
""Not invite that girl here.""  
  
""And you,"" I said, looking at her mother and brothers.  
  
""What the fuck is wrong with you?""  
  
""As her mother you should not have come here without her.""  
  
""Some fucking mother you are.""  
  
""And you guys as her brothers should have stood up for your little sister.""  
  
""She told me our club can go straight to hell.""  
  
""And I just bet she will have somethings to say to all of you.""  
  
I said. ""Gunner you should have mad it plain that girl was included in the invitation.""  
  
""Where is she Grace?""  
  
""In town at the restaurant.""  
  
Then we heard the bike coming down the street. That might be her returning home."" Go get her Ripper.""  
  
I saw her walk into the house as I walked across the street. I knocked on the door and waited for her to answer it. I opened the door and saw the VP standing there. I looked at him with cold eyes. I slammed the door shut and locked it.  
  
What the hell just happened I asked myself. Her eyes were like ice. She took one look at me and slammed the door shut without saying one word. I knocked again but she didn't answer it. I walked back to the club.  
  
""Where is she?"" Asked Gunner.  
  
I told him what happened and her brothers gasped.  
  
""Fuck mom, she is going to do it again.""  
  
""She is going to shut down.""

Chapter 3: Five Months Later

I have not talked to my mom or my brothers. Mom is dating the president Gunner. I do not talk to any of the them. That is because they live in the clubhouse now. I never see any of them.  
  
They don't answer my phone calls either. I feel as if they have forgotten about me. I graduated from high school three days ago. Not one of them remembered or were there at least for me.  
  
I did know that some of the bikers were at the graduation. Because five of the members kids graduated with me. I saw my mother and brothers sitting with them. I did not hear my name called out and they did not meet me afterwards to take any pictures.  
  
I watched as they posed with the club and their kids for pictures. I saw that same girl as I left the school alone. No pictures of me or my family to remember my graduation. It is as if they forgot that I even existed.  
  
I saw that girl look from me to my family with sad eyes. I turned with tears in my eyes and walked over to my car and left. We were sitting in the club when Grace walked in and looked at us with the coldest eyes.  
  
""What the hell is wrong with you Grace?""  
  
""You did not yell out Stars name has she received her diploma.""  
  
""You did not take pictures with Star after graduation.""  
  
""I just bet she doesn't have a graduation party. No presents.""  
  
""No wonder she hates us all.""  
  
""You forgot you even had a sister.""  
  
We looked at each other and felt like shit. No one yelled her name. We are terrible brothers. We walked over to the house but it was empty. Star is not here.  
  
We tried calling her but it kept going to voice mail. Where could she be? I was home. I was in the back yard behind the big building. I was sitting near a small fire, drinking and smoking.  
  
""Congratulations to me."" I said.""  
  
I had drank about six beers. I looked up at the sky and noticed it was getting dark. I put the fire out, grabbed my beer and walked around the building. The house is dark so that meant everyone was across the street.  
  
I grabbed my beer and walked toward the street from the back yard. I opened my car door and grabbed my Cigarrates. And the joint from the ash tray and lit it. I shut the door and turned around and bumped into someone.  
  
I looked up and saw him, the VP. I went to step around him But he stopped me.  
  
""Why don't you come over to the club and see your mom and brothers?""  
  
""Why should I?""  
  
""I have not been invited there before?""  
  
""And where were they when I graduated?""  
  
""Not with me, they were with your club members, yelling and clapping for their kids.""  
  
""They took pictures with them.""  
  
""I was left out on the side lines. Not one of my brothers or mother yelled or clapped for me.""  
  
""Not one of them took a picture with me.""  
  
""And not one of them gave me a graduation gift or party.""  
  
""I don't owe them one fucking thing.""  
  
""So go straight to hell.""  
  
I gave him the finger and walked into the house. She is one angry person. I heard she graduated from high school and no one was there for her. She had no party, nothing. They forgot about her. It was starting to piss me off.  
  
It was like they forgot they had a sister, and mother had a daughter. She was being left on her own. It all started because she was not at the BBQ.  
  
I tried to talk to her but she wants nothing to do with me or the club. They never even tried to make it up to her. Not one of us even came over or tried to talk to her. We are partly to blame for her anger.  
  
I want to get to know her but that is not going to happen. Her mom is marring Gunner tomarrow. I bet she will not attend. What is she going to do when he moves into the house?  
  
Hell, I wonder if she even knows they are getting married? I walked over and looked at her.  
  
""Are you coming to your mom's wedding tomarrow?""  
  
I saw her turn her head and look at me. I could tell she was shocked.  
  
""You didn't know did you?""  
  
I just looked at him. My face going white. I stood up walked into the house shutting the door behind me. Fuck, she didn't know. I saw the light in her bedroom come on. I walked across the street in a very pissed off mood. Not one of them better say a word to me.  
  
I walked to the spare bedroom where the boxes were kept. I started to carry them to my room where I started to pack the things in my room.  
  
I finished packing my clothes, laptop, and other things. I then walked downstairs, grabbed the news paper and walked back to my room.  
  
I started looking for apartments. I called three of them scheduling a time to see them in the morning. Then I shut my bedroom light off and looked across the street.  
  
Why have they all forgotten about me? I don't get it. It is as if I don't matter to them anymore. I was off work today because it was supposed to be a day of celebration for me. It isn't, no one cared about me.  
  
I heard the doorbell and walked down stairs. I saw it was Ace and Panthers girlfriends. ""We came to the party to celebrate your graduation.""  
  
""Where is the party Star?""  
  
""What Party?""  
  
""What do you mean what party?""  
  
""I don't have one. No one even came to see me graduate.""  
  
""We were told to come for the graduation party.""  
  
""You must mean for the club members kids that graduated.""  
  
""There is none for me.""  
  
""They are across the street.""  
  
I saw the anger in their eyes.  
  
""Right over there."" I said.  
  
I closed the door, locked it and walked back upstairs. What the hell we said. How dare they do that to Star.  
  
""I don't know about you Belle,""  
  
"" but I will not date a man that does that to his sister.""  
  
"" I am with you Iris said.""  
  
We put the gifts on the porch. We stormed across the street. When we walked in we found Ace and Panther. We walked over and looked at them in anger.  
  
""You made it to the graduation party""  
  
It got really quiet. ""We went to the house where we thought was Star's graduation party.""  
  
""But found there is no graduation party for Star.""  
  
""So, how was her graduation party boys?""  
  
We all looked at each other.  
  
""We didn't go to her graduation.""  
  
""No you didn't. Instead you went to this fucking clubs kids graduation instead of your own sisters.""  
  
""You are having a graduation party for this clubs kids Instead of giving your baby sister a graduation party.""  
  
""We cannot, and will not have boyfriends who treat their sister like that.""  
  
""Find new girlfriends.""  
  
""You do not mean that.""  
  
""Oh but we do. Tell us this Ace, Panther. Have you guys paid any attention to your sister since you moved in here?""  
  
""Has she been over here?""  
  
""Did this club include her in the graduation?""  
  
""No, so go to hell.""  
  
""We are going to drag Star out of that house, get her drunk, get into fights, and give her a celebration she will never forget.""  
  
""You two go fuck yourselves.""  
  
We turned walked out of their clubhouse and slammed the door shut. We walked over to the house and pounded on it until Star opened it. We walked in and pulled her to her room.  
  
We went threw her boxes until we found what we were looking for. ""Put these on and come back out here.""  
  
""What are you doing?""  
  
""We are going out to celebrate your graduation.""

***Romans 12:1***

* *Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account of God‚Äôs mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.*

**Doctrines are like roots, and duties grow from them.**

After eleven chapters of deep theology, we now get five chapters of practical teaching. Just like beautiful plants need roots, duties need doctrines to support them. Moral actions without doctrines behind them are like rootless plants.

Two key phrases, ‚Äúa living sacrifice‚Äù and ‚Äúbe transformed,‚Äù sum up the lessons in this chapter. We are to offer ourselves to Christ as a living sacrifice, and be transformed in character to reflect His divine beauty.

When we become Christians, we join the body of Christ. This means that the life of Christ is in us, and because His life is in us, we must reflect His character.

We can only achieve this transformation by fully surrendering ourselves to Christ. Then, we will truly be transformed into His likeness.",1,1751989440.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
A thirty-year-old man's desire, raw and unfiltered.  
  
Annie Lane felt like her entire body had collapsed, drowned in waves of intense lust, barely able to breathe.  
  
""It's done. Clear my schedule for the next week. I'm taking time off. Book two tickets to the Maldives,"" Said Zane, standing at the edge of the bed, buttoning up his shirt with maddening leisure.  
  
Annie shifted her sore waist slightly, a hint of joy flashing in her eyes. ""Zane, are you taking me on a vacation?‚Äù  
  
Zane paused for a second, frowning slightly as he looked at her. ""I'm going with Zoe.‚Äù  
  
Annie's smile froze. She looked down awkwardly. ""Okay‚Ä¶ Mr. Lewis.‚Äù  
  
Noticing her expression, Zane added, ""Annie, you're an orphan, and still young. I'll never marry you.‚Äù  
  
Annie looked up at him, her smile tinged with bitterness. ""I never expected you to‚Ä¶ But now that Miss Carter is back and divorced, does that mean our little hidden relationship is over?‚Äù  
  
Zane's face darkened. He reached out, ruffled her hair, and placed a card on the nightstand. His voice softened. ""Be good. Buy yourself something nice.‚Äù  
  
""I don't want to be a mistress‚Ä¶""Annie stared at him stubbornly. She knew Zane and Zoe getting married was just a matter of time.  
  
""It's too soon to talk about that. We'll deal with it when I actually get married. Don't act up, whether it ends or not isn't up to you, ‚Äúhe said, impatience creeping into his tone. He glanced at her once more, then walked out.  
  
The sound of the door closing left a ringing in Annie's ears. Everything else faded to silence.  
  
She was an orphan. Back in her freshman year, her looks had attracted the jealousy of the rich heiress Mia Lewis, who beat her so badly she lost hearing in one ear, had her toe broken, and nearly went blind from cigarette burns...  
  
A video of the incident had gone viral, sparking public outrage.  
  
The school had no choice but to summon the families. The person who showed up on Mia's behalf was her older brother, Zane.  
  
Zane. CEO of the Lewis Group.  
  
Maybe it was to protect the Lewis family's image, or maybe it was pity, but Zane had stepped forward for Annie, who at the time was battered and bruised beyond recognition. The first thing he said to her was: ""Don't be afraid. I won't let anyone hurt you again.‚Äù  
  
It was pathetic, desperate, even, but Annie had fallen for him.  
  
Because in the loneliest, most love-starved chapter of her life, Zane had become everything she ever dreamed of in a man. Security. Shelter. Fantasy.  
  
She once thought he was her salvation. But now‚Ä¶ it was clear. Zane never loved her. He just wouldn't let her go.  
  
Lewis Group Headquarters  
  
Zane was in a meeting, delegating tasks before his time off. Zoe Carter waited in his office.  
  
They were about to fly to the Maldives, for seven sweet days in paradise.  
  
Annie brought her a cup of coffee, pain slicing through her chest like a knife. ""Miss Carter, your coffee.‚Äù  
  
Zoe looked at her and smiled gracefully.  
  
Coming from a wealthy family, Zoe was Zane's childhood friend, a perfect match. Elegant, well-educated, poised. Just sitting there, her presence radiated confidence so blinding, it made Annie's eyes sting.  
  
Annie knew she had lost. She had never stood a chance.  
  
A prince doesn't fall in love with Cinderella. He just uses her to kill time.  
  
Setting down the coffee, Annie all but fled the office in embarrassment.  
  
She had nothing. No confidence. No family. No money. And the trauma from her past left invisible scars etched into every part of her.  
  
""Zane and Zoe are headed on their honeymoon, huh? I heard they've made it official. When they get back, they're going public. Both families have approved the marriage.‚Äù  
  
Gossip buzzed in the breakroom as coworkers chatted about the upcoming wedding.  
  
Annie was filling her cup when the boiling water scalded the back of her hand.  
  
The glass slipped from her fingers and shattered. Only then did the pain register. Flustered, she rushed to run cold water over the burn.  
  
Zane and Zoe were getting married.  
  
Which meant she and Zane‚Ä¶ were done. Her internship at Lewis Group, done.  
  
""Annie, Mr. Lewis wants you to drive him and Miss Carter to the airport at eleven.‚Äù  
  
Someone called out the instruction.  
  
Annie gave a faint, bitter smile. Zane‚Ä¶ was ruthless.  
  
She knew he was doing this on purpose. He had a full-time driver but chose her instead, just to remind her where she stood. To crush any unrealistic hopes she might still be holding on to.  
  
In the end, Zane and Mia weren't so different. Both were bullies, just in different ways.  
  
One broke her body. The other shattered her heart.  
  
Pulling out her phone, Annie hesitated for a long time before finally dialing a number she had once blocked.  
  
""Hello, Mr. Bennett. You once said‚Ä¶ if I agreed to marry you, you'd help me study in Italy. Does that offer still stand? ‚ÄúHer voice trembled slightly.  
  
Marriage. That might be the only way she could escape Ever ford. Escape Zane.  
  
""Are you sure? ‚ÄúThe man's voice was low and calm on the other end. ""Meet me at Riverfront Estate at 7 p.m. on the 13th. We'll go over the details.‚Äù  
  
The 13th. Eight days left.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
""Hey, assistant."" Annie had just hung up when Zoe Carter called out to her gently.  
  
Annie turned around nervously and saw Zoe standing in the breakroom.  
  
She was just too graceful, elegant to the core. Just standing there with a soft smile was enough to make Annie feel small and suffocated.  
  
""Miss... Miss Carter, is there something you need?""  
  
""I suddenly remembered there are still a few things I need for the trip. Could you go buy them for me? ‚ÄúZoe pulled out a handwritten list and handed it over.  
  
Her handwriting, like herself, was delicate and elegant.  
  
Annie stared at the paper, dazed. The word ""condoms ‚Äústared back at her, stabbing her in the heart like a needle.  
  
""Thanks, and please‚Ä¶ keep it between us, ‚ÄúZoe added with a whisper and a playful wink.  
  
Annie nodded stiffly, then practically ran out of the breakroom.  
  
The first time she was with Zane, she had just turned nineteen. It was her birthday. He had bought her flowers and a cake.  
  
As someone who grew up an orphan, Annie had never even had a birthday cake before. That tiny cake and simple bouquet had completely melted her defenses. She gave him everything, willingly and without hesitation.  
  
Now, looking back with a bitter smile, she realized what a joke she'd been.  
  
Girls really should be raised with more love, otherwise, one little cake is all it takes for a man to steal their hearts.  
  
In the four years she'd been with Zane, she had never once bought condoms. Zane didn't like them. He always made her take the pill.  
  
But with Zoe‚Ä¶ there was no way he'd let her take medication. Too harmful for the body, obviously.  
  
On the way to the airport, Annie didn't say a word. She stayed quiet the whole ride.  
  
""We're tight on time. Speed up, ‚ÄúZane said, clearly aware of her mood and deliberately reminding her.  
  
""Yes, Mr. Lewis, ‚ÄúAnnie replied softly and took a left turn as the light changed.  
  
Just as the car in front of them crossed the road, a little boy darted out, ignoring the red light. Annie swerved hard to avoid him and crashed straight into the median.  
  
""Zoe! ‚ÄúZane shouted as the impact hit, shielding Zoe tightly in his arms.  
  
Luckily, the speed hadn't been high, and only the driver's side was seriously damaged.  
  
The airbag deployed. Annie was pinned between her seat and the crushed dashboard. Her left leg was trapped, the pain so intense she almost blacked out.  
  
""Zane‚Ä¶""Her voice trembled from sheer terror. ""Help me‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
She was terrified of being trapped in tight spaces, unable to move.  
  
Back in her freshman year, Mia Lewis had once locked her inside a wooden storage box. No matter how hard she cried or pounded, no one came.  
  
That crushing, suffocating fear had nearly killed her.  
  
If a janitor hadn't noticed the puddle on the floor the next morning, she probably would've died in that box.  
  
""Zane! ‚ÄúAnnie panicked when she saw him about to get out. She didn't care that Zoe was right there. ""Don't leave me behind‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
""Let the rescue team and traffic police handle it.‚Äù  
  
Zane's face was cold as he helped Zoe out of the car and called for roadside assistance.  
  
""The assistant's still in there, ‚ÄúZoe said with a hint of doubt, frowning slightly, because no assistant should ever address her boss by his full name.  
  
Zane pulled Zoe into his arms and gave the wrecked car a quick glance. Then he checked the time. ""We're out of time. The crash isn't that bad. Let's grab a cab to the airport. They'll take care of her.‚Äù  
  
Zoe nodded and gave Annie one last look, quiet, unreadable, then followed Zane away from the scene.  
  
Annie pounded on the window, panicked, but Zane never looked back.  
  
She knew. He was afraid Zoe would misunderstand.  
  
Watching Zane walk away, Annie finally broke down.  
  
""Zane! Please, help me‚Ä¶ You promised! You said you'd never leave me!‚Äù  
  
""You liar! Zane, you're a liar! You said you'd protect me!‚Äù  
  
Her emotions shattered. Trapped in that crushed space, the panic and trauma triggered a wave of self-destructive behavior.  
  
Though her injuries weren't severe at first, she couldn't stop flailing, hurting herself in the process.  
  
""Let me out‚Ä¶ Let me out! ‚ÄúAnnie sobbed, slamming her fists against the window.  
  
The trauma from college came rushing back. She couldn't think clearly. Not until she smelled smoke, sharp, chemical smoke leaking from the engine.  
  
""That car's on fire!‚Äù  
  
""Is there anyone still inside? I saw the people in it walk away!‚Äù  
  
Someone on the street shouted.  
  
Annie was still trapped, alone, counting in a whisper.  
  
""One‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ three‚Ä¶ four‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
The night she'd been locked in the box, she had counted to 6,788.  
  
And now, she wondered‚Ä¶ how high would she count before death finally came?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Maybe cheap lives really are the toughest, Annie survived.  
  
When she woke up, it was already the next morning.  
  
""Dislocated right elbow, mild concussion, multiple soft tissue contusions...""  
  
The doctor stood by her bed, reading from the chart. ""Anything else bothering you?""  
  
Annie shook her head. She picked up her phone and checked it. Not a single call from Zane.  
  
But then she saw something unusual, Zane, who never posted on social media, had actually shared a photo.  
  
It was taken by the sea, crystal blue waters, breathtaking scenery...  
  
Of course, the real focus of the photo wasn't the view. It was Zoe Carter, standing there in a flowing Bohemian dress, looking more beautiful than the ocean behind her.  
  
Annie curled up in bed, pulled the blanket over her head, and cried.  
  
She had been with Zane for four years. And in the end, what was she?  
  
Nothing.  
  
After being discharged, Annie returned to her rented apartment, popped an ibuprofen, and passed out.  
  
She had a big heart, apparently, slept a whole day straight before coming back to life.  
  
After sticking on a few pain patches, she went right back to work.  
  
She still needed to collect her intern paycheck, after all.  
  
""Did you see Mr. Lewis's social media? Oh my God, it's so romantic! He never posts anything, he must really be head over heels for Miss Carter.‚Äù  
  
""He's the definition of a good man. So clean, so faithful, he waited all these years just for her.‚Äù  
  
Annie had just stepped into the office when she heard the gossip.  
  
She gave a sarcastic smile and sat down at her desk.  
  
Sure, Zane did love Zoe.  
  
But ""clean ‚Äúand ""faithful‚Äù? That was a joke.  
  
Annie found it all a little pathetic. Men were all the same, weren't they? Love and sexto separate things in their world.  
  
He might have loved Zoe in his heart, but he sure hadn't kept his hands off Annie.  
  
""Miss, this is the workspace. Lewis said you can't,‚Äù  
  
A commotion erupted near the elevator.  
  
Annie looked over, and her blood froze.  
  
Mia Lewis had arrived.  
  
""Move! ‚ÄúMia barked, stomping in wearing an expensive designer suit, high heels clicking with each arrogant step as she marched right up to Annie's desk.  
  
Annie shrank into herself instinctively. The shadow of what had happened back in college never really left her.  
  
""Annie, my brother's flying back today. He's getting married to Zoe, ‚ÄúMia whispered in her ear, her tone like a demon's breath.  
  
She gave a mocking little laugh. ""Remember what I told you four years ago? The day my brother dumps you, that‚Äôs the day you die.‚Äù  
  
Annie went completely rigid.  
  
Four years had passed, and Mia still hadn't let her go.  
  
Smack!  
  
Right in front of everyone, Mia slapped Annie across the face.  
  
Annie didn't fight back. She didn't even make a sound.  
  
She admitted it, she was a coward. Because she couldn't afford to fight Mia Lewis.  
  
No matter how many times she imagined strangling her in her sleep‚Ä¶ as long as Annie still wanted to live, she couldn't touch her.  
  
But if the day ever came when she truly had nothing left to lose, she'd be sure to take Mia down with her.  
  
For now, she was just pathetic, and desperate to stay alive.  
  
""Remember that slap? ‚ÄúMia sneered. ""Back then, my brother hit me because of you. He sent me off to some godforsaken country. He'd never raised a hand to me before, you made that happen!‚Äù  
  
She grabbed a cup of coffee from the desk and dumped it on Annie's head.  
  
""Annie, did you really think you'd won just because you slept with my brother? Who do you think you are? You're just an orphan. My brother is way out of your league. You didn't seriously think he'd marry you, did you?‚Äù  
  
She shoved Annie's head roughly. ""Get out of Lewis Group. Or I'll send those filthy photos to the company group chat.‚Äù  
  
Annie kept her head down the entire time. Silent.  
  
By ""filthy photos, ‚ÄúMia meant the naked pictures she'd taken back in college, after stripping Annie down during a bullying session? Or did she mean the fact that Annie had slept with her brother?  
  
No one in the office dared speak up for Annie. Mia was, after all, the Lewis heiress.  
  
""Annie‚Ä¶ what did you do to piss her off? ‚Äúsomeone finally whispered once Mia had stormed off.  
  
Annie smiled faintly, wiping her face with a tissue. ""We were college classmates. Had a falling-out.‚Äù  
  
In the restroom, Annie hid in a corner and fixed her clothes.  
  
She didn't cry.  
  
Back in freshman year, she might've cried like a child, screaming about how unfair the world was.  
  
Was it her fault she was an orphan?  
  
Did having no background and no support mean she deserved to be bullied?  
  
Now, she understood.  
  
Being an orphan was a sin. Having no one to back you up was a crime.  
  
Bullies didn't need a reason. They bullied you because they could.  
  
Ding!  
  
Her phone buzzed.  
  
Zane had just sent her 50,000 yuan via WeChat.  
  
The whole office scene must've gotten back to him. He knew Mia had come and slapped her.  
  
Fifty grand for one slap.  
  
Not bad, actually.  
  
""I gave Mia a piece of my mind. Buy yourself something nice.‚Äù  
  
A voice message followed. Same old line, buy whatever you want.  
  
""Thanks, Mr. Lewis.‚Äù  
  
Annie accepted the money. She'd earned it. Payment for pain.  
  
She stared at their chat screen for a long moment. Maybe hoping, hoping he'd ask about the accident. Whether she was okay.  
  
But he didn't.  
  
Not a word.  
  
She closed her phone and went to HR to submit her resignation. Since she was still an intern, the process wasn't complicated.  
  
Tomorrow was the 13th. Tomorrow night, she'd be meeting Mr. Bennett at Riverfront Estate.  
  
If she could just seize this chance‚Ä¶  
  
She could finally escape Ever ford.  
  
Escape Zane.

I hope this post reaches you.

Date and time: July 7th around 3:30 PM

Location: Bangalore Airport Terminal 1 between Gate 17 and 22, near a coffee shop just before the domestic lounge area.

I was sitting on the edge of a garden-like structure with plants and flowers, not on a chair. I wore a grey full sleeve t-shirt, black cap, and had a black Nike backpack. I was on a call.

You came near the coffee shop while on a call, and I noticed you looking at me for a second or two, then turning away, and doing it again repeatedly for a more than 10 minutes. You eventually got a water bottle and moved closer, about 10 meters from me. We both knew that we were attracted to each other. You opened it, drank slowly, and looked my way again like you were aware I was watching.

I missed the chance to approach you despite you coming closer and I regret it. I have not stopped thinking about you since. You were incredibly attractive and had a presence I can‚Äôt forget ever in my life. Maybe it wasn't anything. But maybe... it was something. It felt like a fantasy because I have never seen someone like you and the fact we have shown attraction to each other.

1lursfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1lursfe/advice_needed_sti_protocol_and_understanding/,Advice Needed - STI Protocol and Understanding,"Long post, so please bear with me.

Making this on a throwaway account and requesting privacy because the situation is specific.

NP and I have been open in various forms for much of our relationship and have recently moved into poly (within the year). Recently NP has begun a relationship with a new person. This new Meta has a NP with HSV (most likely HSV2, but no confirmed test). This was disclosed through open communication and the transparent knowledge that health history is being discussed with those involved.

I have done my research around this and have come to my decision around my personal risk tolerance. I do not think I need further advice on the risk factors. My decision is that I am comfortable with barrier free sex between NP and I so long as Meta's NP is on a daily anti-viral. My NP expressed her desire that we continue barrier free sex. 

I did not ask for a new negative HSV test from Meta.  I expressed to my NP that I was stretching my boundaries with these decisions. Knowing they had a date the next day, I said that I'm not sure she can't get a prescription by tomorrow. This was said in what I thought to be joking manner so as to lighten the mood around a heavy conversation. That type of thing is well within my current dynamic with NP.

I disclosed this to my NP who shared with her new partner. Meta's NP got a prescription the next day and started the antiviral that morning. That evening, my NP had protected intercourse with her new partner.

When she disclosed this fact, my initial reaction was that we would need to move to sex with barriers. My NP felt hurt by this reaction as she was under the impression that everything was well within my risk tolerance. I expressed that while I did not immediately know how soon antivirals kick in, I was certain it wasn't same day. She expressed that I should have done my research and clearly communicated how long I wanted the antivirals used prior to it being within my tolerance. My opinion was that my statement ""on an antiviral"" should have meant on and in an active phase (not sure about that wording).

I am also hurt that, upon minimal research, the period to become active is relatively short (less than a week). I feel that my NP chose the riskier option (putting both her and my health at risk) rather than wait until that period was over. My NP did express that she assumed an antiviral would be active on day one.

While I know that the risk factors did not logically or realistically change based on the time between Meta's last test and now, I cannot help but feel frustration that my expressed desire of an antiviral before unprotected sex between NP and I has not been met. I am also frustrated and confused how three people (Meta's NP knew that sex was on the table the same day) came to a different conclusion of what ""on an antiviral"" meant.

There's a large part of me that has been feeling my NP has not been managing NRE in a reasonable manner. This action added to those feelings as I feel anyone would think there is a waiting period for an antiviral to begin working. My NP feels that NRE played no part in the decision as she fully stayed within my risk tolerance as the antivirals had been started.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. Maybe it's advice on how to move past my hurt feelings. Maybe it's advice on how I can better explain risk tolerance in the future. Maybe it's just needing people to tell me I am wrong to feel hurt so I can better explore my own feelings. I'm open to any and all feedback.

1. A budgeting system that helps you¬†**see**¬†how much you gotta save each month to hit your goals, no boring numbers, just simple visuals 
2. Add expenses however you want; type them in or just snap a picture of your receipt, because who has time to type all day? 
3. Chat with AI about your spending, ask it questions, get advice, or just rant about how you blew your whole paycheck on snacks lol

one day, while wandering through al fahidi historical neighborhood, i met a local family who invited me to join their majlis for tea. we shared stories, laughter, and i learned so much about the traditions that shape the community. that moment reminded me that beyond the towering skyscrapers and luxury malls, the heart of the uae beats in its people and their welcoming spirit.

1lurps6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lurps6,Looking for Feedback ‚Äî First Espresso Machine Purchase (New vs. Used) Prime Day Deal [$No Budget],"Hey everyone,
I‚Äôve been on the hunt for an espresso machine for the past 6 months and would love your thoughts on a specific deal I‚Äôm considering.

I check Facebook Marketplace daily, but most used machines are still going for $350‚Äì$500. I usually don‚Äôt mind buying secondhand, but with espresso machines, it feels a bit risky without knowing how well they‚Äôve been maintained.

For context, I‚Äôm currently using a Keurig K-Supreme, but after getting hooked on lattes, it just isn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. Between the rising cost of coffee and how much I enjoy the process, investing in a good machine seems like the right move.

With the help of everyone here, I received 4 fulls and 2 partials on the last project, and my fingers are crossed that this next one might be the one. I learned to start drafting my query early, which is why I'm already here to humbly request feedback before I hopefully start querying late-summer. PS: Do we collectively prefer the 'upper' or 'lower' housekeeping placement? All of my requests last time came from a lower placement, but it might've been due to the menacing wordcount of my last project.

Dear \[AGENT\],

It is a pleasure to query you with a new project. You previously requested \[LAST PROJECT, or insert other personalization here\].

TO BECOME THE MOON is an adult romantasy, complete at 92,000 words. Steeped in Nahua (Pipil) culture and set against the lush backdrop of precolonial Central America, it blends the fairytale feel of Emily Rath‚Äôs *North is the Night,* the lyrical prose in Kritika H. Rao‚Äôs *The Legend of Meneka,* and the bonded rivals in Maiga Doocy‚Äôs 2024 debut, *Sorcery and Small Magics.*¬†

Itotia, a healer‚Äôs apprentice struggling to meet her mentor‚Äôs expectations, gets visions when she touches others. She believes she‚Äôs possessed‚Äîan omen bad enough to warrant exile or death‚Äîand attempts to fix it with a banishment ritual that mistakenly binds her to a god. The sardonic creature is self-serving and nothing like the gracious deity she thought she prayed to. If she can‚Äôt get them out of her head before her clan grows suspicious, she‚Äôll not only forfeit her dream of becoming a healer but become just like them. Or worse.¬†

Metztli is the exiled moon deity. They recognize Itotia‚Äôs life bond the moment it snaps into place and they‚Äôre enraged beyond reconciliation. Only a ruling god can sever it, and when human Itotia dies, so will they. Metztli swallows their hatred for the divine queen who exiled them and makes a bargain with her: they will deliver Itotia and her powers in exchange for a broken bond.¬†¬†

The two can hardly get through a conversation, let alone a shared line of thought. Where Metztli is fierce, Itotia is soft. As Metztli struggles to train none-the-wiser Itotia in magic to prepare her for the queen, something more unnerving blooms in their bone-carved chest. They begin to relish Itotia‚Äôs silly, human habits‚Äîmuch like how Itotia starts to view them as more than a particularly fickle deity. But Metztli has already set their fate in motion. Short of a life bond with a mortal, the only way to kill a god is through them defying a divine bargain.¬†

By day, I am a psychology student at \[Mexican university\] and a self-employed graphic designer. I am a Salvadoran-Canadian that drew from my direct Pipil ancestry when crafting this story. Nestled in the mountains in \[redacted\], I can be found with a cat on my shoulder and coffee in hand. Like Itotia and Metztli, I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community.

I hope this post reaches you.

Date and time: July 7th around 3:30 PM

Location: Bangalore Airport Terminal 1 between Gate 17 and 22, near a coffee shop just before the domestic lounge area.

I was sitting on the edge of a garden-like structure with plants and flowers, not on a chair. I wore a grey full sleeve t-shirt, black cap, and had a black Nike backpack. I was on a call.

You came near the coffee shop while on a call, and I noticed you looking at me for a second or two, then turning away, and doing it again repeatedly for a more than 10 minutes. You eventually got a water bottle and moved closer, about 10 meters from me. We both knew that we were attracted to each other. You opened it, drank slowly, and looked my way again like you were aware I was watching.

I missed the chance to approach you despite you coming closer and I regret it. I have not stopped thinking about you since. You were incredibly attractive and had a presence I can‚Äôt forget ever in my life. Maybe it wasn't anything. But maybe... it was something. It felt like a fantasy because I have never seen someone like you and the fact we have shown attraction to each other.

I live between M√ºnchen and Starnberg and would love to meet someone nearby who‚Äôs ready for something real. Life feels more meaningful when it's shared with the right person. And, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping to find.

I‚Äôm tall (187 cm), with dark hair and blue eyes. I‚Äôve got a strong build with a bit of softness in the middle. I‚Äôm also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I enjoy the simple things: quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I‚Äôm into anime, manga, and board games. So yes, you could say that I‚Äôm a bit nerdy.

What matters most to me is connection, both emotional and physical. I usually feel that spark more with women who are naturally slim, fit, or have an average build. That‚Äôs just me being honest about what I‚Äôm drawn to, not trying to be selective.

There‚Äôs one thing I want to be upfront about: I‚Äôd love to have a child of my own one day. I know that‚Äôs a big thing to share early, but I think it‚Äôs important to speak from the heart.

I‚Äôm not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I‚Äôd much rather meet in person, have a coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe.

There‚Äôs a photo on my profile if you'd like to put a face to the words. And if something here speaks to you, I‚Äôd genuinely love to hear from you. :)",1,1751988403.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1lurgn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1lurgn1/sudden_coworker_behaviour_change_towards_me_does/,Sudden coworker behaviour change towards me. Does she hate me now? I'm confused.,"I really need an outsider perspective. I (28) have worked here for about 4 years now and she (26) has worked for 3,5 years. Our workplace relationship used to be very good as far as work friendships go. For the past 3 years we have been talking to each other almost every day for 10-15 minutes, even buying something to each other from time to time whenever one of us went outside for a break. I always thought we like each other.

The whole situation changed (or at least I think it started then) about 6 months ago when I started going and talking to other coworkers while of course still maintaining our workplace relationship with her at same time. She started entering the office of the person I was spending time with every time I was there. She immediately started checking on me if I was there and leaving quickly after confirming it. It happened many times but it's not a big deal for me, just a bit strange. It looked almost like unintended spying or something.

However, several weeks ago and till this day her attitude towards me suddenly changed (or at least I think it has) and I'm really confused about it:

1. It's a bit out of context but she told me that ‚Äûnobody here (at work) really likes me‚Äù. It didn't bother me too much since she said it was a joke but maybe it was the start of this entire issue? Who knows?
2. There were situations where after talking to her for 2-3 minutes, she said something like: ‚Äûalright, go back to your office‚Äù or just turned her back to me, pulled out her phone and stopped listening to me after 1-2 minutes of talking. Things like that happened maybe 3-4 times so I stopped coming and talking to her since it was clear to me that she wasn't willing to talk to me anymore (maybe I'm mistaken?). Additonal info - she has no problem talking for 10-15 minutes with other coworkers like she used to do with me.
3. I was appointed to some new responsibilities in substituting another coworker (male one) who started working shorter hours due to some health problems. I was supposed to do this job each time he left the workplace. However, even though he was still physically present at work, my female coworker who is the topic of this post called me to do his job several times (she is supposed to point clients to respective people and offices). One time I went to her office and asked me why she was calling me instead of the other guy who was still there just to her some strange excuses like: ‚Äûhe is about to leave the work soon anyway‚Äù or ‚Äûhe is not doing his job properly anyway‚Äù.
4. Several days after that she didn't call me to do my male coworker job when she was supposed to and it created a small misunderstanding in handling the client who suddenly appeared in front of me without any preperation. After attending to him I walked down to her and asked her in a relatively polite way: ‚Äûwhy didn't you call me when the client arrived?‚Äù. She suddenly started yelling at me with a very angry expression like I had never seen before: ‚Äûwhy do you always have to nitpick everything?!‚Äù. I went back to my office without saying a work to her after hearing that.
5. One time she started talking to me with other male coworker when I was passing close by, told me that I'm fucked in the head or something like that and started laughing at me. At that point I stopped coming to her or looking at her completely. Just a quick hello and goodbye at the start and end of the work.
6. There were situations where I was sitting in the kitchen making coffee with my other male coworker friend when she suddenly entered and started talking to him only. She was also calling him her bestie all of the sudden and asking only him questions and also acting like I wasn't there at all. Happened two times.
7. I also noticed that at some point in the past several weeks her face goes from a wide smile to a really emotionless/pissed face whenever I talk, even not to her.
8. It might be my imagination but she started loudly complementing other coworkers in my presence or when I'm in the vicinity. Loud enough for me to hear it from 10-15 meters away. She never does it when I'm not nearby. Confirmed it with other people at work. Is it a way to make me angry or something?

I am almost positive and I didn't do anything that could get her angry at any point. We are a relatively small community (about 35 people) and my job relies on having a decent relationship with most of my coworkers. Oh and by the way, I confronted her at some point and asked if everything is alright between us and she bluntly replies yes. When I tried to press further and asked her about the time she yelled at me, she said something like: ‚Äûdon't worry, I was just talking to myself back then‚Äù. Like... what? It was clear to me that she didn't want to talk to me.

And do you know why I'm really confused? It's because recently she has been going and asking two other coworkers I have good relationship with if I'm angry at her or if I'm offended at her. Also, she is apparentaly surprised that I don't come to her office and talk to her anymore. She also mentioned to them that she didn't know the reason. However, at the same time, she makes 0 effort to even go and talk to me when she does have some free time or when we are in 1 on 1 scenario.

I wouldn't even bother and ask anyone about it if it was some random person. However, I really used to like her a lot. What do you think about it? Oh and thank you for reading this long and chaotic post.",1,1751988279.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

1lurf50,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1lurf50/princess_cruise_seattle_to_alaska_and_back/,Princess cruise Seattle to Alaska and back.  Observations/Tips.,"This was my first cruise ever.  Perhaps this post will help others.  Departed from Seattle, Washington.  Visited Juneno, Skagway, Glacier Bay, Ketchican, and Victoria City.  Returned to Seattle.

1. The entire staff of the ship was friendly and very helpful.  Any questions they were happy to assist.  It's a busy ship with about 2000 employees to service about 2000 passengers.

2. I heard certain cruise ships have certain demographics.  I didn't want to be around 1000 kids or 1000 senior citizens.  This Princess cruise was the perfect blend.  I saw/met people in their 30s with babies, 40s with kids, and older folks 50-80.

3. My room had one queen size bed and one couch bed.  Sleeps three.  However, the couch bed is next to the balcony door and when it's a bed you cannot reach the balcony door.  Have to climb over the bed to reach the balcony door.  Not ideal.

4. The bathroom is very small which is understandable, but the toilets were tiny throughout the ship.  Not a fan of tiny toilets and I'm not a big person.  Also, it wasn't possible to flush the toilet unless the seat was down.

5. Getting around the ship is very easy after two days.  The app has a map along with interactive maps on the walls throughout the ship.  But, after two days you know where everything is.

6. Each person has a ""medallion"" which is a GPS tracker along with payment function.  Looks like an AirTag.  It's the only item you need throughout the ship.  Pays for anything.  Allows for exit and entering the ship.  Also allows you to be tracked 24/7 by anyone in your group.  You can also add other people such as friends, etc.

7. The app was very helpful.  Has a list of all ship events, excursions which can be purchased through the app, ship map with GPS tracking, and a chat feature to ship passenger service.  In regards to GPS tracking, this is great if you have a family or group on board.  You can locate them with the app.  You can also send chat messages within the app to each other since cellular doesn't work.  Can also order food and drinks through the app.

8. Excursions were expensive.  I spent about $2000.  Would have been $1200 if I booked outside the cruise, but then there's the risk of not making it back on time.  As long as you're in an excursion sold by the ship they 100% will not leave port without you.  So, the additional cost comes with some perks.  If it's your first time at a location I recommend going through the ship versus booking excursions alone.

9. The food was better than average for a buffet.  There is a lot of food and a solid variety.  About eight sections of food total.  One is always desserts and coffee.  Two sections always rotate.  It could be Chinese then Indian then Italian, etc.  They're always the set food area with pasta, pizza, etc.  Their salad sections are surprisingly good along with plenty of fresh rip fruit.  They even had cook to order steaks/chicken, noodles/rice dishes, etc.

10. I am not a pool person, but there are three food venues by the pool.  The soft serve ice cream is free, all you can eat, and pretty good.  The burger and hot dog station is **amazing** (the fries are excellent).  Everything is cooked order and the food is good sized (not tiny or thin).  There's also a pizza venue.

11.  The buffet, pizza, burger/hot dog/ice cream is all included in the ship cost.  There are a few other restaurants that you need to pay for, but honestly I didn't find them worth it considering it's cruise ship quality.  You won't get a quality steak on a ship versus a steakhouse on land.  The free food is more than enough along with enough variety.

12. With 2000 passengers the elevators can be busy.  Using the stairs can save a ton of time.  If it's 1-3 levels just use the stairs, else you may be waiting 5-8 minutes for an elevator.

13. I purchased the Plus package which included unlimited water bottles, 15 alcoholic drinks a day (which I found to be a lot), free specialty coffee (lattes, etc), and other small perks such as two free specialty desserts per day.  The other perk is one device can be connected to the ship's WIFI.  Tips are also included in the Plus package so no need to give any gratuity.

14. FYI, any package purchased must be purchased by all adults in one stateroom (room).  If there's two adults in the room both will be charged for the package.  I did not find the Premium package.

15. Before booking your trip look at the itinerary of the ship.  Most town visits are around 8-10 hours, but sometimes they are much shorter such as 3-5 hours.  Keep an eye on when the ship arrives.  If it's early morning you need to wake up early and/or plan accordingly.  This is key in booking a cruise.  Itineraries are different so select the best suited for you.

16. My ship went up the ocean side the first two days then slowly down the shoreline the next five days so I booked my room on the left side.  Keep an eye on which direction your ship sails because it makes a difference.  I wanted the side that viewed Alaska the most and it was great sitting on my balcony with the view.

Overall, I was very pleased with Princess.  The ship was in great condition.  Rooms were comfortable enough considering it's on a ship.  The food was above average.  The staff service was excellent.  Hope this information helps.",3,1751988177.0,PrincessCruises,6,1.0,False

The whole situation changed (or at least I think it started then) about 6 months ago when I started going and talking to other coworkers while of course still maintaining our workplace relationship with her at same time. She started entering the office of the person I was spending time with every time I was there. She immediately started checking on me if I was there and leaving quickly after confirming it. It happened many times but it's not a big deal for me, just a bit strange. It looked almost like unintended spying or something.

However, several weeks ago and till this day her attitude towards me suddenly changed (or at least I think it has) and I'm really confused about it:

1. It's a bit out of context but she told me that ‚Äûnobody here (at work) really likes me‚Äù. It didn't bother me too much since she said it was a joke but maybe it was the start of this entire issue? Who knows?
2. There were situations where after talking to her for 2-3 minutes, she said something like: ‚Äûalright, go back to your office‚Äù or just turned her back to me, pulled out her phone and stopped listening to me after 1-2 minutes of talking. Things like that happened maybe 3-4 times so I stopped coming and talking to her since it was clear to me that she wasn't willing to talk to me anymore (maybe I'm mistaken?). Additonal info - she has no problem talking for 10-15 minutes with other coworkers like she used to do with me.
3. I was appointed to some new responsibilities in substituting another coworker (male one) who started working shorter hours due to some health problems. I was supposed to do this job each time he left the workplace. However, even though he was still physically present at work, my female coworker who is the topic of this post called me to do his job several times (she is supposed to point clients to respective people and offices). One time I went to her office and asked me why she was calling me instead of the other guy who was still there just to her some strange excuses like: ‚Äûhe is about to leave the work soon anyway‚Äù or ‚Äûhe is not doing his job properly anyway‚Äù.
4. Several days after that she didn't call me to do my male coworker job when she was supposed to and it created a small misunderstanding in handling the client who suddenly appeared in front of me without any preperation. After attending to him I walked down to her and asked her in a relatively polite way: ‚Äûwhy didn't you call me when the client arrived?‚Äù. She suddenly started yelling at me with a very angry expression like I had never seen before: ‚Äûwhy do you always have to nitpick everything?!‚Äù. I went back to my office without saying a work to her after hearing that.
5. One time she started talking to me with other male coworker when I was passing close by, told me that I'm fucked in the head or something like that and started laughing at me. At that point I stopped coming to her or looking at her completely. Just a quick hello and goodbye at the start and end of the work.
6. There were situations where I was sitting in the kitchen making coffee with my other male coworker friend when she suddenly entered and started talking to him only. She was also calling him her bestie all of the sudden and asking only him questions and also acting like I wasn't there at all. Happened two times.
7. I also noticed that at some point in the past several weeks her face goes from a wide smile to a really emotionless/pissed face whenever I talk, even not to her.
8. It might be my imagination but she started loudly complementing other coworkers in my presence or when I'm in the vicinity. Loud enough for me to hear it from 10-15 meters away. She never does it when I'm not nearby. Confirmed it with other people at work. Is it a way to make me angry or something?

I am almost positive and I didn't do anything that could get her angry at any point. We are a relatively small community (about 35 people) and my job relies on having a decent relationship with most of my coworkers. Oh and by the way, I confronted her at some point and asked if everything is alright between us and she bluntly replies yes. When I tried to press further and asked her about the time she yelled at me, she said something like: ‚Äûdon't worry, I was just talking to myself back then‚Äù. Like... what? It was clear to me that she didn't want to talk to me.

And do you know why I'm really confused? It's because recently she has been going and asking two other coworkers I have good relationship with if I'm angry at her or if I'm offended at her. Also, she is apparentaly surprised that I don't come to her office and talk to her anymore. She also mentioned to them that she didn't know the reason. However, at the same time, she makes 0 effort to even go and talk to me when she does have some free time or when we are in 1 on 1 scenario.

I wouldn't even bother and ask anyone about it if it was some random person. However, I really used to like her a lot. What do you think about it? Oh and thank you for reading this long and chaotic post.

I am fairly new to this hobby of home espresso making, and it has become a calming part of my morning routine. However, I also don't plan on going super deep into the hobby, I have been happy with the quality of what I drink now. I used to be a black coffee person, so this is already a huge upgrade!

I have used the Delongi ECP3420 for the last 18 months, using a bottomless portafiler and IMS basket. My wife uses it time to time, but she just uses the pressurized basket it came with and preground coffee.  I recently got Baratza Encore which took my game to the next level. Recently, the ECP has started being extremely inconsistent due to a leak around the PF (a seal broke). This morning it actually bursted from the pressure leakage. Replacing the part would require huge disassembly and repair, which I don't think is worthwhile since I paid $45 for the machine!

My wife is letting me use this opportunity to upgrade. I don't need anything crazy, as I like the simplicity of the current setup (I only make lattes, so...). And I want to keep something that the wife can easily use like she does now. 

Is there a machine that is sub $500 that would upgrade my espresso game while still letting the wife pull simple shots? Or maybe spending $100 for a new shiny ECP be worth it since we know it works for us?

Am I broken or is this normal?","I've become obsessed with morning routines and it's not working. At all.

Started 2024 after watching too much reels I finally decided to actually do it and follow their advice. Thought if I just got the morning right, everything else would follow. Here's what I've tried:

**The 5 AM phase (3 months):**

* Felt like a zombie by 2 PM
* Started drinking 4 cups of coffee to function
* Weekend sleep-ins made me feel guilty

**The meditation phase (4 months):**

* 20 minutes of sitting quietly hating my thoughts
* Apps telling me I'm ""making progress"" when I felt worse
* Falling asleep during sessions and waking up more tired

**6 months**

* Gym at 6 AM, exhausted by lunch
* Injuries from pushing through fatigue
* Skipping workouts led to shame spirals

**Current routine**

* 6:30 AM wake up
* 10 minutes journaling (mostly complaining)
* Cold shower (which I hate)
* Protein smoothie
* Still feel scattered and reactive all day

I track everything. Sleep (7.2 hours average). Steps (8,500 daily). Water intake (3L). The numbers look good but I don't feel good.

Meanwhile my roommate wakes up at 8:30, drinks coffee in bed scrolling Instagram, and seems genuinely happier than me.

Is there something wrong with me that I can't make this work? Do morning routines actually help anyone or is it just productivity theater?

I don't have much money and I can only afford one single ""treat"" for a long time, and I am overthinking if it should be this game.

I have played a lot of Goat Sim 1 and 3 and I loved both, and I played all DLC from both games, except the Hocus Pocus and Super Duper packs on GS3. I want more. My favourite maps were MMO, Waste of Space and Goatz in this order, but I never got to play the mobile version with it maps (I don't have a powerfull enough phone for goat).

Is the Remastered good enough to justify getting it over replaying the old one if it's been quite some time since I don't play the original? I don't know much about the University map but is it good?

I know this is my decision and I should be the one evaluating the game's worth and the amount I'm willing/able to spend, but I'm asking for a comparision between the new and the old one in terms of ""what the new one brings to the table"" so I can use that to choose better.

Bea had never left the town she grew up in, she‚Äôd thought about it, looked at college courses or apartments in the city‚Ä¶but for one reason or another she always stayed, still working at the Sunny Side Up Diner, one of the few places that had survived. 

She didn‚Äôt mind it really, the customers were friendly, the food was decent and her manager wasn‚Äôt a total pain. Sure there was the occasional trucker who gave her ass a squeeze as she poured their coffee, but hell‚Ä¶it got her decent tips. 

Her route home took her past her old family home, her parents had sold it up to buy an RV‚Ä¶spend their golden years seeing all 50 states or whatever. What was more interesting was seeing a car parked up at her neighbours house, one she could have swore was empty for years. 

She remembered going round as a kid, hiding behind her mom until she met the neighbours boy and followed him out on the trampoline. They had a good friendship, stayed close as they got older sipping beers in the run down truck he‚Äôd saved up for. The summer everyone left for college, Bea hoped he‚Äôd be staying‚Ä¶but a few days later he told her he‚Äôd signed up. Basic Training, wasn‚Äôt sure when he‚Äôd be back. Promised to keep in touch. That was tricky to do when being deployed all over. She‚Äôd only seen him once since he left, over Christmas when his folks still lived here, he invited Bea out to dinner. Not a date just‚Ä¶dinner. Even that was a few years ago.

She shook her head, unsure why the sight of a truck in their driveway had brought all those memories back, returning to her apartment after a few more stops on the bus, untying her apron and counting up her tips. 

The next day started the same way, curled hair, a little lipgloss, the bra that always seemed to get her extra tips, a rush not to miss her bus and back to the diner. Bea rushed around with coffees during the breakfast rush and chatted to another waitress when things got slow, stealing fries from the kitchen. 

She was distracted today, still thinking about the neighbour‚Äôs kid. Honestly, since it had been a few years‚Ä¶she had half a mind to believe he might be dead. The thought of that, of not knowing where his grave was‚Ä¶that was enough to screw up a fair few breakfast orders. 

‚ÄúPsst~ cute guy at the bar seats‚Ä¶left him a menu. Who wants him?‚Äù Said another waitress leaning into the kitchen, she was a motherly 50 something year old woman, who was always complaining about the fact Bea wasn‚Äôt heading out on dates every weekend. 

‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶Alright. But he better be cute. The guy you said was cute last time was missing both his front teeth.‚Äù Bea frowned, grabbing a water jug and leaving the kitchen. 

‚ÄúMornin‚Äô sir. I‚Äôm Bea i‚Äôll be looking after you today. Have you had a chance to decide what to ord-‚Äú 

Bea‚Äôs eyes widened as he placed the menu down, almost flooding his glass of water. She couldn‚Äôt believe who was sitting there with a familiar grin. 

‚ÄúMy god‚Ä¶what are you doin‚Äô back here? Thought i‚Äôd seen a ghost‚Ä¶‚Äù She said with a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd hug you but I don‚Äôt want to give the other customers ideas‚Ä¶‚Äù Bea teased, glancing back to the kitchen to one of the other waitresses. She knew whether she wanted to or not she‚Äôd end up caught up in conversation - she gave her the look‚Ä¶the look of *i‚Äôll give you half my tips if you help look after my other tables for me?*

So there‚Äôs a very much more extroverted friend (I think) I met at a sports club, we used to talk a fair bit and we‚Äôve established that we r both gay and single. Then lately I‚Äôve kinda stopped coming to the club due to my studies kinda getting a bit stressful. In the few times I would go, she‚Äôd hug me and say something like ‚Äúwe should catch up‚Äù or ‚Äúwe should get coffee for sometime‚Äù which I‚Äôve by now taken as just being small talk.

Now the club‚Äôs on break for the summer, and my delusional silly brain is thinking of asking her if she wants to meet up for dinner or something.

Another thing to add is that I‚Äôm completely silent and shy during the sessions, so she probably sees as me as some pathetic being whilst she‚Äôs really confident and talks to literally everyone there.

Given that I barely talk to her, other than the long walk to and from the sports place and some social events that I try to attend and end up leaving early, and that one time I made her dinner after training. Would it be completely strange if I sent her a message asking if she wanted to hang out? Honestly it doesn‚Äôt even have to be a date, I just want to talk to her without being in an overwhelming social environment.

Or should I just find a way to stop being delusional ü•≤

Another problem is, around my close friends, I‚Äôm actually really loud, annoying and nerdy, im scared that even if I muster up the courage to ask her, and she agrees, she will immediately get the ick after I open my stupid mouth to talk about my favourite mathematician or the lore of some anime, and then I will have to see her every time I go train or I‚Äôll have to drop out of the club and find a new one.

And often there'll be three or four cars doing it, empty while the driver chats in the shade. 

I saw someone stop his car in the middle of the road on 29th, leave it there, blocking traffic, and stroll into the Coffee Pot for coffee. WTF? 

The parking police are RABID over parking violations when it comes to meters and hydrants, and they're out scouring for money from working folk, but they ignore the double parkers every. Single. Time. 

How can you be called traffic cops if you ignore the folks running red lights, double parking in intersections or right next to one, and speeding like demons down every street - I live near a school and it's shocking how fast folks zip by there. Also, why is it people on scooters can ignore traffic laws?

Normally, each coffee cherry has two seeds inside, side by side, kind of like twins. But every now and then, for some reason, only one seed develops, and it ends up being round ‚Äî like a little marble.
Here in Colombia, we call those Caracolitos. In English, you might know them as Peaberries.

They‚Äôre pretty rare ‚Äî maybe 5 to 10% of a harvest ‚Äî and even though they taste great, most people leave them out.

Here‚Äôs why: when coffee is exported, it‚Äôs sorted by size, using screens (what we call ‚Äúmallas‚Äù here). And everyone wants big beans: screen 16, 17, 18‚Ä¶

But Peaberries are small, so they always drop down to the lower screens (13‚Äì14) and get left behind.

And even if you want to work with them, you need to hand-sort them to take out the broken, chipped, or defective ones. It‚Äôs more work. But honestly? It‚Äôs worth it.

In our experience, when we manage to sort them properly, the cup is something else:

Sweeter

Brighter

Cleaner

With a kind of concentrated feel

Some say it‚Äôs because all the sugars and nutrients that would‚Äôve gone into two beans end up in just one. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs scientifically proven, but I do know the flavor is different.

So if you ever get the chance to try them ‚Äî especially if you can compare them with the regular beans from the same coffee ‚Äî go for it. It‚Äôs a different experience.

Yesterday I posted a long-form SWOT refresh on aTyr Pharma. With an unusually quiet news calendar this week, I‚Äôm taking the breather to perform **another business-analysis pass** on the company and deepen the thesis. Below you‚Äôll find a **full PESTLE analysis** (Political-Economic-Social-Technological-Legal-Environmental) that maps every major external force pressing on efzofitimod as we enter the <90-day window for pivotal data.

* **Punch-line:** virtually every external lever I can find is nudging *supportively* toward aTyr.  
* **Number that jumped out:** the new ATS 2025 epidemiology poster pegs U.S. parenchymal sarcoidosis prevalence at **‚âà 159 000 patients** ‚Äî around 25 % more than many older sell-side decks still quote.  
* **Why this matters now:** policy shifts, funding flows and recent deal multiples suggest the conversion rate from good Phase 3 data to real valuation could be unusually high in Q3.

**Quick note on support** ‚Äì I‚Äôm one guy, unfunded, pulling these deep dives together after hours, poring over filings, conference abstracts, epidemiology posters and policy documents so we can all walk into catalysts with eyes wide open. If you value the work and want to help me keep expanding (and maybe add more tickers), please consider supporting via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/biobingo). Huge thanks to everyone who already has‚Äîevery contribution genuinely fuels the next round of research.

OK, let‚Äôs get into it.

## What *is* a PESTLE analysis?

A **PESTLE** scan looks at six macro dimensions that sit outside a company‚Äôs direct control but strongly influence whether internal execution translates into real-world value:

| Letter | Dimension | Typical biotech questions it surfaces |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **P** | Political / Regulatory | Are policy shifts, agency backlogs or trade tensions likely to speed or slow approval, pricing or supply chain? |
| **E** | Economic | How big is the true addressable market? What do deal comps and capital-market cycles imply for valuation or funding risk? |
| **S** | Social | Are patient-advocacy groups, demographic trends or public-health narratives creating tail-winds (or head-winds) for uptake? |
| **T** | Technological | Is the underlying biology validated? Are manufacturing and digital-health trends likely to sharpen the competitive edge? |
| **L** | Legal | What does the patent wall really look like? How might price-control statutes, data-privacy laws or exclusivity regimes bite? |
| **E** | Environmental | Do sustainability mandates, climate-linked incidence trends or green-manufacturing incentives matter to payers or acquirers? |

By scanning each dimension, we see whether the **wind is at a company‚Äôs back or in its face**. For aTyr, this lens shows a rare alignment of tail-winds just as the binary clinical catalyst approaches.

### Strategic observations for retail holders

| # | Observation | Expanded discussion |
|---|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Policy roulette tilts positive.** | Broader IRA carve-out would future-proof follow-on labels; downside limited since first label already qualifies. |
| 2 | **PBM reform = stealth margin booster.** | Pass-through pricing could raise net revenue without raising list price‚Äîan earnings lever few DCFs include. |
| 3 | **EU access could accelerate revenue.** | One JCA + cost-offset data could pull cash flow 6-12 mths earlier. |
| 4 | **Mechanism risk near de-minimis.** | Dual tier-one validation leaves statistics‚Äînot biology‚Äîas the main risk. |
| 5 | **Volatility fuel.** | ‚âà 15 % float short + dense call OI at $10-15 could exaggerate initial move. |
| 6 | **ESG premium is real.** | Carbon-light production fits Scope-3 mandates and can add a turn to multiples. |
| 7 | **Digital health shortens ‚Äúprove-it‚Äù lag.** | Wearables could feed payers early RWE, smoothing uptake. |
| 8 | **Oncology call-option.** | ATYR2810 offers a free second story outside consensus. |
| 9 | **Competitive white-space.** | No NRP2 rival beyond pre-clinical; nearest sarcoidosis biologic reads 2027+, leaving 5‚Äì7 yrs solo. |
| 10 | **Macro-rate tail-wind.** | Expected Fed cuts lower discount rates just as revenue ramps. |
| 11 | **BARDA dollars on the table.** | Domestic-plant credits could lift margins and ESG scores. |
| 12 | **First-mover EU HTA edge.** | Being first sets comparators for followers, locking in pricing power. |

## Key takeaways

1. **External forces align:** policy carve-outs, HTA reforms, PBM scrutiny and ESG trends all lean toward efzofitimod.  
2. **Scarcity + patent-cliff urgency:** recent 7√ó-sales deals show what late-phase orphan assets fetch once de-risked.  
3. **Mechanism doubt gone:** two peer-reviewed papers leave execution and statistics as primary variables.  
4. **Market structure magnifies moves:** short interest and option skew could exaggerate price action.

---

## What could go wrong?

* **Statistical miss:** effect size could fall short despite sound biology.  
* **Unexpected safety signal:** infections or malignancy would upend benign profile.  
* **Policy reversal:** tighter orphan exemptions could hit future labels.  
* **PBM inertia:** reform might stall, leaving rebate claw-backs intact.  
* **Macro shock:** risk-off markets could mute fundamental re-rating.  
* **Manufacturing hiccups:** scaling continuous production is non-trivial.

### Closing thoughts  

I hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this read and the fresh angle on aTyr. While the focus here is $ATYR, the same PESTLE lens is a practical tool you can apply to any company in your portfolio. Give it a try, and if questions pop up, drop them in the comments.

This PESTLE scan suggests that a clean Phase 3 read-out would ripple through a stack of supportive tail-winds: favourable policy tweaks, margin-boosting channel reforms, patent-cliff-driven buyer urgency and an ESG narrative tailor-made for modern diligence checklists. **Execution risk remains, but the conversion rate from good data to durable value now appears materially higher than in a typical small-cap biotech.**

Are you a maverick? A wild card? A loose cannon with nothing to lose and a coffee addiction to prove it?

Perfect. Because I‚Äôm definitely getting too old for this shit, and its HIGH TIME someone demanded my badge and gun on their desk by the end of the day.

So‚Ä¶ you in? Wanna make some questionable life decisions together?
Good. Saddle up, Rookie. You‚Äôve just been assigned a new partner.

Hi, I‚Äôm Jarod.

No, I‚Äôm not really a cop. Faaaaar from it.
I‚Äôm actually an artist (graphic designer with a soft spot for watercolors), a nerd (think MTG, D&D, TMNT, and the Discworld flavor of geekery), a bit country (raised on a ranch ‚Äî boots, beards, and a deeply suspicious respect for cows), and just a smidge fancy (I love to cook and I will judge restaurant plating like it‚Äôs the Food Network).
I lean left. Both politically and because I walk with a limp. (It mostly only shows when I‚Äôm tired, but it‚Äôs there. Call it character.)

I‚Äôm almost 3 years into recovery from alcoholism ‚Äî and yeah, it feels weird to celebrate 2 years of not wrecking the ever-loving-hell out of my life, but it was a hard-fought win. So... hey. I did that. And now, I‚Äôm on this whole-ass journey of self-discovery, self-love, and (hopefully) self-assembly into someone even better. Part of that means actually putting myself out there to meet people ‚Äî good people, the right kind of people.

I‚Äôm polyamorous and demiromantic.
I‚Äôve got two amazing partners. I live with one and a meta, and see the other a few nights a week. We practice kitchen table poly ‚Äî think: community, care, and a tangled, respectful web of humans doing their best to love each other well.

Despite all that, I still have plenty of time for conversations, connection, and open evenings to share.

So, what‚Äôs the M4R angle?
I‚Äôm looking for community (if it exists), friends (if we click), and connection (if the stars align).

No pressure. No expectations. Just two humans seeing if the vibes vibe.

If you made it this far, I think we just solved our first case together.

I wanted to share my experience. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve had this problem since I was in kindergarten. I still remember when my grandma literally grabbed me to sniff my breath and told my grandpa it didn‚Äôt smell normal.  
I‚Äôve always had perfect hygiene‚Äîmouthwash, floss, the whole thing. I wore braces for years, so I was constantly seeing dentists. I had my adenoids removed when I was 6.  
I remember classmates making fun of me for my breath when I was little. It really affected me. The more I took care of my hygiene, the less it seemed to help.  
Now I‚Äôm 30, and nothing‚Äôs changed. Since I found this subreddit, I‚Äôve tried changing my habits, with some help from ChatGPT too.

I have gastritis‚Äîmy family situation is a mess and I tend to somatize all my stress in my stomach. Now I live alone and I‚Äôve changed my diet based on ChatGPT‚Äôs tips. The gastritis has improved: less burning, less bloating. But the bad breath is still there.

Here‚Äôs my routine:

* I drink 100% aloe vera juice every morning
* I finished a full cycle of Kijimea K53 Advance probiotics (I also tried oregano oil, but it smelled awful and burned my stomach)
* Then I took Enterolactis Plus
* I rinse my nose daily with a hypertonic spray (Rinazina)
* I brush my teeth 3‚Äì4 times a day and use a tongue scraper
* I used to use CB12 mouthwash

I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve improved or not. I‚Äôve been in a relationship for a year, and in the past few months my girlfriend has asked a few times, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù‚Äînever thinking it could be me.  
The fourth time she said it, I guess my face gave something away‚Äîmaybe I looked sad or annoyed‚Äîand she just looked at me with so much tenderness. Since then, she‚Äôs never brought it up again. I think she figured it out but didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings.  
Now I just don‚Äôt know... do I still smell bad or not?

I drink 2‚Äì3 coffees a day, and at night I smoke 1‚Äì2 joints (weed helps me sleep). I used to drink even more coffee, but I‚Äôm trying to cut it down to just one a day.  
Other than that, I‚Äôm careful with what I eat‚Äîno sugar, acidic stuff, or smelly food. I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt drink enough water though‚Äîmy mouth is often dry, and I‚Äôm trying to work on that.

For the past few years I‚Äôve also had this weird smell inside my nose. I thought it was because of my septum piercing, but I removed it four years ago and it‚Äôs still there.  
I‚Äôm following the diet ChatGPT suggested, but maybe there‚Äôs something else going on? Maybe something in my stomach? Also, I live in Italy and the healthcare system here is basically falling apart. If I went to a doctor for this, they‚Äôd probably just laugh or brush me off‚ÄîI honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be taken seriously. I‚Äôve been thinking maybe I should try something more natural? Like going to a herbalist and asking for advice?

I read people here saying they‚Äôve been dealing with this for a few months or a couple years... I‚Äôve had it since I was born.  
I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. It‚Äôs exhausting.

Wash (10s) - aroma is grassy with touch of floral, funky sheng note

Steep 1 (flash) - light note of sharp/funky hay, light bitterness, slight coating sensation, herbal and cocoa notes on finish

Steep 2 (flash) - light bitterness with grassy/hay notes, flashes of bright fruitiness, finishing with crisp vegetables 

Steep 3 (5s) - tingle starting to hit my lips and tongue, creaminess accompanying lingering moderate bitterness 

Steep 4 (10s) - moderate bitterness with floral and grassy/hay notes, faint sweetness develops late into herbal/vegetal finish

Steep 5 (15s) - Similar, bitterness fading a bit, still most prominent notes are fresh/bitter vegetable notes with a distinct creaminess 

Steep 6 (20s) - sweetness coming up a bit more in the finish with aromatic coffee and milk chocolate notes

Steep 7+ - similar, but drops off quickly. By steep 10 it's getting pretty watery, even though I reboiled my kettle

Overall impression - I need to preface this by saying that my palate is not bringing its ‚ÄúA‚Äù game today. My choices for the morning were either to sleep in and catch up on some much-needed sleep, or have a gong fu session. I chose tea, but my palate wishes it was still in bed.

That said, this is a well-balanced young sheng with a nice body to it. It has just the right balance of bitterness and astringency, and plenty of bright/fresh herbal character. Aside from that, I'm not getting a lot. I'm sure some of that is from a sleepy palate, but I'm not even getting that sense that there's nuance that I'm just not able to resolve. From this tasting I'm getting a nice, straightforward young sheng, without anything really remarkable of note. Maybe this might develop with some age, but it's awfully expensive for what it is right now. I'll have to try one of the less expensive Yiwu's that Bitterleaf released this year for comparison.

I (24F) broke up with a guy (32M) less than a year ago. It didn‚Äôt last long. He was SUPER sweet and thoughtful, actually treated me like a queen, like breakfast in bed and foot rubs. Legit nicest guy I‚Äôve ever dated. But we were just fundamentally incompatible, especially in bed. Like, the sex was just not it. He‚Äôs really small down there, and no matter how many polite hints I dropped, it didn‚Äôt get better. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice or understand that I wasn‚Äôt getting off. I actually liked him, got along super well outside of that, but I started resenting how satisfied he always seemed. I was irritated all the time, even cuddling felt like a chore. Eventually I said we weren‚Äôt sexually compatible and ended it.

We stayed in contact after the breakup, mostly because it wasn‚Äôt a messy one. I didn‚Äôt plan to keep him around, but he started checking in occasionally, asking me how I‚Äôm doing, so I replied, and we started casually chit chatting like that. At one point, I was venting about being on my periods and craving mcdonald‚Äôs, and later on I heard the ring. He had it delivered to my place. I thought it was cute, but I didn‚Äôt wanna give him the wrong impression, so I just said he didn‚Äôt have to and kept it short.

Then one day, maybe a week or two after the breakup, we were arguing about something stupid he said, and I was having a bad week, so I texted him half annoyed something like ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre so sorry, come do my dishes"". They were piling up in the sink so that's where my mind went

He showed up an hour later. I thought he was kidding, but nope. He literally did my dishes while I laid in bed. I laughed and told him he didn‚Äôt have to, but he insisted and did it. When he finished, I jokingly said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more useful doing my dishes than trying to f\*\*\* me‚Äù, and he laughed. I was like, okay, maybe we can be friends after all.

One day, I mentioned being stressed about doing my taxes, since it was my first time filing them. He offered to take a look, and I kinda brushed it off, but he said he could help me figure it out, so I gave him my login. He ended up doing the whole thing for me. It was a huge relief considering how I was dreading it, especially with how easily I stress about things, so I thanked him a lot.

A few days later, he texted me asking if I needed anything. I was hesitant at first, but I was drowning in work, and I desperately wanted to change my sheets, so I said ‚Äúare you sure?‚Äù then asked him if he could do my laundry. He came and took it to the laundromat. He asked if I wanted him to get something from the store on his way back. I said ‚ÄúSure‚Äù and texted him a a couple things.

Then, it started happening more. I never really asked, he offered and I told him what I need. Groceries, laundry, a latte, whatever. For a while, I felt guilty about it, especially when I started seeing other guys. One day as he was folding my clothes, I said ‚Äúyou sure you don‚Äôt mind doing this?‚Äù and he just shrugged and said no. I thanked him, offered to pay him, but he refused. At one point, I stopped arguing and just let him. I was working long hours, and honestly it was nice having someone who just handles stuff. He‚Äôd text me usually in the afternoon ‚Äúdo you need anything today?‚Äù, and I usually did. I‚Äôd say like ‚Äúcan you grab tampons?‚Äù, next thing I know he sends a pic from the aisle to make sure he gets the right ones.

It got worse when I started hitting the gym regularly. Between daily workouts, my job, dating, and getting my drivers license, I could barely breathe. The last thing I wanted to do was spend my one free day doing chores. So, having him around became essential. I started sending him on errands I didn‚Äôt have time or energy doing, like returning stuff from Zara, picking up a charger I forgot, even standing in line at the DMV for me. Every now and then I'd think I should stop this, that I should just do things myself, but every time I let it slide because I was too busy.

Like there was this one day I got home exhausted, and realized I lost one of my airpods at the gym and called him in a panic. I was freaking out because they‚Äôre expensive and I had just gotten them. He went there and asked, looked, didn‚Äôt find them. I kind of snapped and said like ‚ÄúIt has to be there, I just had them, look again‚Äù. He kept looking for an hour, checking under benches, until eventually I found it on my bed. I called him in relief and apologized. It became a running gag between us (deserved tbh)

Another day, I was running late to a dinner because of work, and I texted him last minute to bring me a specific nude polish I needed for my outfit. While I was running around getting ready, I spilled coffee under the kitchen counter. When he showed up, I was barefoot, my blouse half tucked into my skirt, doing my eyeliner in the mirror. I just said like ‚ÄúGo clean that, I‚Äôm gonna be late,‚Äù without looking at him. A few minutes later, I was at the door in heels checking my Uber, and I saw him down on the floor with paper towels, reaching under the counter. I just stood there watching him clean my mess while I was dressed up for a night out, and actually felt shitty. I said like ""You must think I'm a bitch"". He looked up and said no, not at all. I thanked him, grabbed my bag, and left.

It‚Äôs been about 8 months now, and it became a routine at this point. He comes over once or twice a week, more when I need something. Fridays are automatic, I text him a grocery list and he shows up in the afternoon. I leave the door open and he walks in. I say hello or wave if I‚Äôm on a call, he puts the stuff away, then cleans the apartment. No drama, no awkwardness, it just stopped feeling weird overtime. I‚Äôm usually still working when he‚Äôs around, so I barely look up from my laptop when he‚Äôs doing the dishes or mopping the floors, he knows what to do and I trust him. If there‚Äôs anything specific, like if the fridge smells, I‚Äôll just wave towards the kitchen and say like ‚ÄúClean the fridge today‚Äù. Half the time he comes and goes while I‚Äôm still on a Zoom call. If there‚Äôs an article or package to return (and there usually is with my shopping addiction), he takes care of it.

Sometimes we eat lunch together when I‚Äôm not in a rush. He‚Äôs better company than a lot of guys I‚Äôve been seeing. We talk about politics, shows, his family drama. Sometimes we watch a movie when he‚Äôs around on my days off. Once we got into a heated debate about the israeli palestinian conflict while I was doing my nails. It got a bit loud, but it was nice having someone to talk to about real stuff for once.

Work has been draining though, I‚Äôm always on the edge, and I have this persistent neck pain that won‚Äôt go away. It‚Äôs been affecting my mood, and I caught myself being sharper with him than I mean to. Like last week, I dragged myself to the gym after a long day, and I came home, sweaty and sore, annoyed from someone trying to flirt with me during squats. I walked past him doing something around the apartment, didn‚Äôt wanna talk, and went straight to the shower. When I came out, I pointed at the laundry basket, just said ‚ÄúTake that too‚Äù and went to my room. I always regret my attitude afterwards, so I‚Äôll be extra nice the next days. But eventually the stress comes back, and so does my snappy mood.

The other day he was massaging my calves after leg day while I was scrolling. I could feel the tension easing out of my legs  and sighed like ‚ÄúGod, you‚Äôre the best‚Äù. And he is, he‚Äôs chill, doesn‚Äôt try anything weird or get handsy, which is a HUGE green flag. Sometimes I catch him checking me out when I‚Äôm in shorts or whatever, but that‚Äôs normal. He‚Äôs not creepy, never touched me inappropriately. And I don‚Äôt flirt with him or lead him on either, nor do I lie about my dating life. I mean I don‚Äôt flaunt it, but he‚Äôs seen me get ready, running around in a towel and doing my makeup in a rush, so I guess he knows. Like sometimes I ask him to clean a pair of sneakers or boots that I want to wear out, and he doesn‚Äôt mind.

Sometimes when I have a moment (like right now), I think about how great it is to have him around. I can focus on my life, and everything else is just handled. I don‚Äôt have to worry about errands, and the place is always clean, which is great since I work remotely a lot. The one ‚Äúchore‚Äù I have to do is meal prepping once a week, and even then my tupperwares are always clean. I only really notice how weird it is when my friends bring him up. Especially my best friend, who‚Äôs convinced I‚Äôm secretly sleeping with him. Every time I tell her he‚Äôs over, she makes some corny joke about us. I laugh it off, but it makes me uncomfortable, well because it's not true.

Sometimes, these comments do affect me. One weekend I got out of the shower and texted him to grab me Starbucks. I was feeling super lazy, just chilled on the couch in a towel, scrolling on tinder while waiting. He showed up 20 minutes later with my drink, I thanked him. Didn‚Äôt really need anything special, so I told him to clean the baseboards. He got down and started wiping along the wall. I just crossed my legs and kept scrolling while sipping my iced coffee.

At one point I looked up from my phone and he was scrubbing super close to where I was sitting, like right at my feet. I froze and suddenly became hyper aware of how short the towel was. I felt so exposed seeing him down there with his face near my thighs. I stared at the top of his head for a second thinking, wtf am I doing? Why am I here half naked while this dude who‚Äôs not my boyfriend is sitting three inches from my ass? I could tell he was just doing his thing, but for some reason I was uncomfortable. Those dumb jokes my friend makes started echoing in my mind, and I saw how indecent it looked. I got up, got dressed and made up an excuse to kick him out.

I wanted a break, so I decided not to text him for a week. I went out to grab groceries for the first time in months, walking around the store, carrying bags. It actually felt good doing something that wasn‚Äôt either mentally or physically draining. I made some big plans in my head, planning to do everything myself, full PMA.

Then the week hit, and as per usual, I was drowning in meetings, deadlines, gym, and messy hookups. I woke up on Sunday, sore all over, and stared at pile the dishes, the greasy pans, the sweaty gym clothes tossed on the couch. I stood there for a bit, thinking about how long it would take me to clean that up. Then I just laid back, turned on Netflix and texted him to swing by.

I guess made peace with the fact that not every dynamic has to be conventional. I‚Äôm busy, I have a demanding job, I hit the gym 5 times a week. If someone wants to make my life easier, I‚Äôm not gonna say no just because it looks bad. AITAH ?",0,1751985769.0,AITAH,7,0.4,False

1luqb4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/InnerCircleInvesting/comments/1luqb4n/market_digest_710_one_last_taco/,Market Digest (7/10) - One last TACO?,"I was worried about this and it seems to be tracking.

Since the tariff shock back in Feb., and the wild ""V"" formation we saw, and have now completed, and with the 90-day window to the most recent suspension closed, we're staring down the gun of ""what's next?"" Trump TACO'd another window to 8/1 but it seems obvious to me that the music is setting to end, and we're going to be on the cusp of another round of rhetoric.

There are few reasons why most nations haven't already realized what the game is. The markets are just now slower to respond to it and have desensitized to the impact. With markets at new highs, Trump has every ability to do another reset. He's fully aware that he holds the keys to to starting and stopping rallies and I in no way think this game is over. We supposedly had dozens of deals about to be done and announced but few have materialized. 

While markets may have panicked-out, recovered, and now rallied, the economy will be what the economy will be, and there are few things that have occurred to suggest it won't still be materially impacted. We still have higher tariffs, corporate costs/expenses are rising and just because inflation hasn't been seen yet, doesn't mean it won't be. If, when, 8/1 rolls around and Trump begins another round of hard-line rhetoric, I see no reason why, economically speaking, we shouldn't be back in the same boat we were in back in Feb. 

I guess what I'm saying is that there is an incongruency, a disconnect, between the markets and the economy and we seem to be look down at our feet with a degree of recency bias. Markets are in full rally mode, price targets have been raised, stocks are at new ATH's and, as my recent GARP screen has shown, there are few intriguing bargains out there. The RSI metrics are stratospheric right now and due to correction.

I'm not saying we can't rally further, I'm just saying we have this next 3 week window to consider our positions and position for the ""just in case"" opportunity, similar to what we saw the first time around. 

What has *really* changed? Trump has a lot of *opportunity* now with the markets at ATH's. He can shock them again to play hard ball, all the while knowing that he can rally them when the pain reaches a threshold. 

**What am I doing?**

I just haven't heard anything new the makes me suggest that markets will continue to rally on anything other than the fact that we are/have. We're on the precipice of another round of earnings and that could be material. The further we get into this new environment of increased tariffs, even at 10%, the more we should see the cracks become to form. Even if companies are eating cost/expense so as not to raise prices, spike inflation, they should become more apparent. The offset is if economic activity, as a pull-through on expectations, could be hiding the tariff impact. It will be fascinating.

Mindset and psychology play huge roles in my activities. On one hand, a large majority of my positions are set it and forget it in nature, and not something I trade in and out of. It may appear differently as I'm only posting the changes. What you are not seeing is how many changes aren't happening. How about a coffee metaphor, this from someone who doesn't drink coffee?

Somewhere along the line, these new coffee drinks started looking a lot like my favorite treat, milkshakes.  There's coffee in there but often topped with a lot of foam and/or whipped cream. If my portfolios are filled with a lot of coffee, I'm simply adding or blowing off foam. 

That was terrible.

Let's just say that I continue to blow off foam.

In my taxable accounts, I'd say about 98% of the positions are set and unadjusted. The few trades you see are additions for income or end of year tax loss harvesting. Nothing else.

My IRAs make up 98% of the activity you see here on the IC. Of that 98%, I'd estimate 75% of the portfolios are set and only adjusted when I add to them. Most all of the activity happens at the 'foam' level, the top 25% of positions. That is where the markets are moving and I'm adding, or removing, based on the current environment. 

A favorite tactic of mine has always been to use positive market periods to blow off foam and add to the coffee below, and I continue that now. Nearly every positive trade, whether short in duration or long term, has some of the gain allocated to my favorite long term positions. That is how I keep greed in check.

As I continue to trim into strength here, I've been bolstering income names and my primary cash equivalent holding of $SGOV has been growing again, just as it did into the end of Q1. Money management is the name of the game and sometimes you simply have to be happy with your performance and step away from table or at least take step back, still play, but with less risk and just to have fun. 

I'm firmly still in trim mode and I sense another round coming up. At the same time, while I'll still add to existing, or new, long term positions as I see value, most new trades you'll see will likely be to the short side, probably more targeted on broad averages such as the S&P500 and Nasdaq. 

**Random Shots**

[$NVDA YTD](https://preview.redd.it/jc30nk4apnbf1.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=78b7b6ff88014fd55b9f6cd43ed3a6ca07b2ebd1)

Still the market darling and all roads lead to/from her. She's in a make or break area here and we're now at that $160/$170 level that so many analysts were pegging. As such, we're seeing the resistance at $160. As I've been saying for some time now, no new upgrades are in the bag. Everything is out of the bag and the only thing left for analysts to do is to raise price targets on ""favorable"" conditions. Nearing a $4T market cap now, sitting at about $3.88T. Amazing.

$CRWV - It's my only short position and I took 9/25 $170 Puts when the stock was at $170 and again when it was over $180. I still think it's going to experience significant weakness but the premiums are holding for now. Despite the $156 price tag today, well below where I took the positions, the position is still down 7.5%. Welcome to options. There will be a point where the Greeks start breaking down on this name but it has been resilient. The Delta, how much the option changes to that of the underlying has been impressively resilient. At the same time, my average cost is $65.65 and that was/is a lot of premium to pay for a $170 strike expiring in Sept. It needs to roll over soon for Theta to start working in my favor. For me, it's all about the IPO lockup. These next 3-4 weeks is going to tell the story and if it doesn't move into early Aug., I'll need to liquidate.

AI - What I'm noting most is that we're not getting new highs now. We're AT new highs and even upgrades aren't moving the issues any longer. $VRT was given a nice upgrade, sending the stock back to $129, where it faded again. This is also happening to most of the big names - we're seeing lower highs. Not a great omen as the new 8/1 tariff window nears and I think it's an indication that momentum is fading. I can't find one of our top names that is the exception.

$AMD - Has been strong and seems to be maintaining some of that strength, though it hasn't been able to sustain the $140 level. I would have expected it to sell off now but it has been holding, a clear sign that  we've had a reset.

$BABA - I thought I might see the $100 level, but it's rallying today. I have 2U already loaded and looking for up to 2-3 more, but prefer to see it break down before adding. I'm patient here.

$JPM/$GS - Clearly the leaders of the FI movement and they had a nice new run but are catching downgrades now after such a big move. Only my alternative financial $BX is bucking the trend.

$LULU - Still hoping to see that come in a bit more before adding another unit. No hurry.

$IBM - Has been impressing me with its strength. I trimmed some in an account I'm managing.

$KBR - Likely my new initiation when I feel confident that it has found a base. I'm waiting to see the market roll over and for this name to rise or stay flat before wading in with my first unit.

$RDDT - Following the pattern I mentioned about short-term lower highs. This one had seen a very nice reversal and I'm still convinced we'll see new highs soon, but it's going to be choppy. I don't see this as an issue that will move against the market. Meaning, if the market rolls over RDDT should too.

**Final Word**

Please remember an extended rally does not ordain further rally. In fact, an extended rally needs to exert more energy to maintain itself. If you throw a stone straight up, there's a point where the momentum is lost and new highs become unreachable. While the markets don't march to the forces of gravity, they do march to some combination of supply-demand, momentum, and catalyst. While far more difficult to predict, the end result is often the same.

To some degree, the amount of pushback I get when I start calling out the loss of momentum is a great indicator of how much closer we are to the top.

The most difficult variable in the equation is that a so much is dependent on the words of a single man. And that, my friends, is an impossible variable to predict.

1luqb0b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1luqb0b,Displaying Coffee Bags / Decorating the Coffee Station (DIY),"Hopefully this is of some interest to the group and may inspire others....

I find the variety of art and design on coffee bags to be enchanting. I decided to save my coffee bags for 2024 and at the end of the year created a framed ""best of 2024"" art piece to hang next to my station. Here's the result.

It's 14 framed bags, all consumed in 2024. It captures some local roasters, some bags picked up while traveling, and some from Trade (coffee subscription service). If you're looking to do something like this yourself, here's how I did it and some tips.

* I used an inexpensive IKEA frame. I believe it's a 24""x36"" LOMVIKEN frame, though it appears they don't make that size in gold anymore. The LOMVIKEN or R√ñDALM frames will be your best best if you're looking for the larger sizes, but YMMV. You could also pick up cheap frames at Goodwill / second hand stores or craft stores like Michael's.
* I rough cut the back of the bags off using scissors. I tried to not touch / remove any of the edge of the bags to make mounting as easy as possible.
* I measured and recorded the length and width of the face of each bag that I wanted visible. I made sure to leave at least a few MM around each corner for mounting.
* I spent an hour on the kitchen table laying out the bags in different orders / configurations to see what I liked. This game me the rough layout based on frame dimensions, bag design, bag size, etc.
* At this point I realized that it was going to be a pain to get the exact cuts / dimensions for each window by hand, so I decided to use CAD (Fusion 360) to do a layout. I'm a CAD newbie with minimal experience. I had just started to teach myself for a 3d printing project. Working on a 2d layout proved easy and a great learning project. It allowed me to get the spacing perfect between bags and rows and make sure everything was aligned.
* I ordered some uncut matboard online and a mat cutter. Long story short, don't bother. Cutting such precise windows without any mistakes was about four orders of magnitude beyond my abilities.
* Turns out there's lots of online shops that will make custom matboards for you. I used Matboard Plus. They had a simple online tool where you could ""draw"" your windows. It was easy to transfer the cuts/dimensions from my CAD drawing into their online tool.
* When the matboard arrived, one at a time I centered each bag in the appropriate window (from behind) and used small pieces of mounting tape to secure the edges and corners of the back to the back of the matboard.
* Finally, with all the bags framed and centered and their cutouts, I placed the matboard into the frame and mounted it on the wall.
* Total project cost (ignoring my dead ends like a mat cutter and DIY matboard) Was around $125. That's the frame, custom cut matboard, and mounting tape.

I seem to be reliant on coffee to get going and start working on anything that requires brainpower at a computer. Without coffee it's like there's an 80% chance of getting distracted or answering little emails or checking feeds/RSS or anything else but starting the real and effortful work/writing (or a workout, for that matter). 

Decaf doesn't seem to do the same trick. And honestly, when the coffee is gone, it's hard for me to get going, so I *really* have to get my productivity started while drinking it or it seems nearly impossible to get going and I waste so much time on little nothingness activities and distractions. But I also can't keep filling up my mug or I'll get anxious -- more than 2 coffees a day and I'm cooked.

Has anyone else accidentally trained their brain like this? What tips do you have? What worked for you to change things?

I'm especially thinking in terms of behavioral conditioning principles. Like, I've got to break some associations or make some new ones, I think. It seems hard to just willpower my way out of it. I tell myself to just DO the work without coffee -- surely if I manage that enough times, it'll become a new habit -- but then it rarely works.

Is it that my desk as a location has been Pavlovian associated with warm, yummy coffee and I need to break that with a new location? Is it that I need to cut down / stop coffee? Or just power through and try so hard to get hard work off the ground without coffee and then use coffee as a reward when I've completed something or been productive for X time?

It has long meditative sections that can gently rock you to sleep, followed by rapidly built peaks that demand your attention. It‚Äôs unique. It‚Äôs inspirational. It‚Äôs honest.

I‚Äôve written about it before, and now I‚Äôm writing about it again. 

But before I begin, I need to warn everyone that drugs, like wild pigs, are dangerous and unpredictable. And I would never encourage you to do drugs without consulting a medical doctor. Do not do drugs!

However, if you ever find yourself having already accidentally done drugs, and you don‚Äôt know what to listen to, I‚Äôd highly recommend The Virginia Beach Fee.

Let‚Äôs say hypothetically you‚Äôre about to go to work on a Tuesday morning and your roommate says, ‚ÄúOh by the way, I put LSD in the coffee you already drank, and in 5 minutes you‚Äôre gunna be tripping balls.‚Äù

And you say, ‚ÄúNo way, Tim! I hate LSD! I‚Äôm a law abiding citizen who doesn‚Äôt do dangerous recreational drugs!‚Äù

And Tim says, ‚ÄúToo late now dumbass. You‚Äôve got five minutes to find some good tunes before you lose the ability to reliably use electronics.‚Äù

What do you do in this situation?

I‚Äôll tell you what you do.

You find the good headphones. Open the Live Phish app. Find Live Bait 10. Press play on The Virginia Beach Fee.

(It‚Äôs a lot of steps, I know. And the clock is definitely ticking. But you can do it man. Just hurry.)

Another option is to go out to the car and listen to The Virginia Beach Fee using the car speakers. Especially if you have BOSE or something. 

Very Important: if you are high on lsd listening to The Virginia Beach Fee in your car, and that car is in a garage, you really need to open the garage door.

So to recap:

1) Do not do psychedelics.

2) When you next accidentally do psychedelics, try listening to The Virginia Beach Fee.

3) Open the garage door, if applicable .

Thank you for your time

I quit coffee a few years later when I started suffering from IBS, but picked it up again in 2021 when I began working.

Over time, I think I developed some sort of dependence ‚Äî I needed more and more to feel the same boost (though never more than three espressos a day ‚Äî I‚Äôm in Italy, so they‚Äôre small and strong).  
Anyway, by the end of 2024, coffee was giving me energy but also bad stomach pain and gastritis, so I quit again and switched to black tea.

At first, tea worked great. But soon I noticed the same pattern: energy, dependence (I used to drink about a liter a day with just one teabag), and eventually‚Ä¶ stomach pain.

I‚Äôm pretty sure the problem is caffeine itself.  
My doctor recommended some supplements with guaran√† (a very small amount of caffeine), but they gave me the same issues.  
So I gave those up too and tried several other options. The only thing that works *a bit* is a supplement I found that contains royal jelly, magnesium, ginseng, and vitamins.

It‚Äôs now been nearly a month without caffeine, and the last few weeks at work have been really tough: trouble focusing in the early morning, feeling sleepy after lunch, fatigue, and a very low mood ‚Äî especially on Sundays. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety, and although I‚Äôm doing much better than before, I started experiencing these low moments a few months after tapering off my SSRI (under the supervision of my neurologist).

Right now I‚Äôm on a work break due to a car accident, so I really hope that those supplements help even on my hardest, most exhausting days, when I'll come back in the office. Sometimes I just really want something that can bring me energy and good mood, so I was wondering:

I‚Äôm trying to understand if others with Crohn‚Äôs face similar issues when it comes to staying focused and alert - especially without upsetting the gut. 

Here are a few assumptions I‚Äôm working with, and I‚Äôd love to know if they resonate with you:

* Caffeine is off-limits ‚Äì Coffee, energy drinks, or high-dose caffeine products cause GI discomfort or flare-ups.
* Most sports/alertness supplements are gut-unfriendly: Pre-workouts often contain caffeine so are off-limits, and nootropics don't contain caffeine so they don't actually help with focus/alertness. 

Do these points feel true for you too?

If so, how do you manage your focus and energy levels in a Crohn‚Äôs-safe way?

My marriage just went up in flames and i'm sitting here wondering if i crossed a line that can't be uncrossed.

So my husband caught me with his best friend last month. Not just texting or whatever - full on affair for six months. He came home early from a work trip and found us in our bed. The look on his face still haunts me but honestly? Part of me was relieved it was finally out.

He didn't yell or scream. Just stood there for like ten seconds, then quietly asked his friend to leave. After that he told me he wanted a divorce and that he'd be staying at his brother's place while we figured things out.

Here's where it gets messy. He started telling everyone what happened. His family, our mutual friends, even some of my coworkers somehow found out. Suddenly i'm getting dirty looks at the grocery store and my sister-in-law won't even look at me at family events.

I was furious. Yeah i cheated but did he have to destroy my reputation? So i decided to hit back where it would hurt.

I knew he used to smoke weed in college and still had some old party photos on his phone. I took some of those photos and used editing apps to make it look like he was doing harder stuff. Made it look like cocaine lines on our coffee table, photoshopped white powder around his nose, even created fake text conversations between him and a ""dealer"" using a burner phone.

Then i posted everything on social media. Facebook, Instagram, sent screenshots to his work email and his boss. I wrote these long posts about how i'd been ""living in fear"" of his ""addiction"" and how i was ""finally brave enough to speak out.""

The response was immediate. His job put him on administrative leave pending investigation. His mom called him crying. His boss told him not to come in until they sorted things out.

But here's the thing - i didn't expect him to actually get arrested. Apparently someone at his work called the police about the ""evidence"" i posted. They showed up at his brother's place with a warrant and everything.

He spent two nights in jail before his lawyer got him out. The charges were dropped when the photos were proven fake, but not before it made the local news. His job fired him anyway because of the ""scandal.""

Now his whole family knows what i did. His brother called me screaming about how i destroyed an innocent man's life. His mom sent me a text saying i was ""evil"" and that she never wanted to see me again.

The thing is, he's not innocent. He cheated on me emotionally for years - always putting his work and friends first, never making time for me. That's why i ended up with his friend in the first place. I was lonely and neglected.

But now there's a police investigation into filing false reports and i might actually face charges. My lawyer says i could be looking at jail time.

Everyone's acting like i'm this monster but he humiliated me first. He could have kept our business private but instead he made sure everyone knew what i did. I was just defending myself the only way i knew how.

So reddit, am i the asshole here? Or did i just fight fire with fire?

I no longer dream
of the gold and silver sky.

The dream, instead,
is leftover lives
I didn‚Äôt get a chance to experience‚Äî
except in repeat.

Like old shows
on TV
at my grandma‚Äôs house.

In life,
days pass
with no more
than a few cups of coffee
and cigarettes
stomped out
after opening my eyes.

Complacency is a companion
that serves me still‚Äî
a convent pet
that sits in the corners,
echoing thoughts back at me.

I remember
running scared down alleys,
looking up
all the while
being yelled at
about where to go.

Ducking to hide,
I swallowed my breath‚Äî
their voice behind me:
""Don‚Äôt stop running again.""

The streets
belted with wind
as thin mist
runs sideways
down sidewalks
that hold shining stones,
glistening.

I would find
a bird of prey
every time.

Always
just some chick alone
under the towering building
just left of the obelisk.

A voice from the rooftops
imploring me
not to leave
and find them food.

I never do.
Neither does the maintenance man‚Äî
the one with mirrored, photo-red eyes.

Instead,
I go to the patio
with the broken bird fountain
perched just above
the bricked, graffitied dumpsters.

Age-pocked
with green moss
and gray streaks‚Äî
it never seems to decay.

From its plateau,
a view over
the private club fence
where they feed
on naked man.

Sometimes
the rail breaks
and I crash through the trees,
spilling out
to the parking lot
as she looks for a lighter
and the door slams shut
behind her.

Always
the oboe plays
at the corner crosswalk‚Äî

music I haven‚Äôt heard,
nor‚ÄîI think‚Äî
anyone after fourteen hundred.

Winding up
back
where the window falls out
on its anniversary
after our chat
and the refusal
of the chrome-plated Zippo
as a gift
I no longer needed.

Where the fire raged
from a time forgotten,
its deep smell of copper
like the top of a church,
with a hint of sadness
they make their home.

The street across
behind the abduction
is a hidden door.

Up its steps‚Äî
the library
from times
before this land
was governed.

I sat alone
within myself,
dragged through it
like the streak
of an upside-down smudge‚Äî
a face
and handprints
on the ten-foot-square glass
of the top floor
DSS building.

No more
would I be uplifted.

The handmade signs
by the shops
on Market Street
read:

THE FALL.

I had landed‚Äî
solid
and finite
this time.

The light
had gone out
like the hour
when the sun fades
and darkness
enfolds the land.

A wandering shell
that keeps living
after the love is gone.

My soul
wasn‚Äôt present.
Like a pair of old shoes‚Äî
it wore out
until nothing
there was left.

As if
a lover‚Äôs note
that simply said:

Now it‚Äôs from the heart
forever instead.

If I had said
it was okay‚Äî

Maybe one of you can encourage me to, or maybe it's just pointless and better not to. Part of me just wants to do something to make things better. Thought I'd post it here at least. I don't know why. But would love to meet up with anyone from clarkstown to talk if you‚Äôre interested. Maybe it‚Äôll be therapeutic. Idk. The revamping of our healthcare system with the legislation signed last week is really scary and crazy to me. 

""Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve never posted in this group before, and honestly I‚Äôm a little nervous about doing it. But I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately‚Äîespecially after the big bill that was just signed into law‚Äîand I figured I‚Äôd put this out there.

Some of you might‚Äôve seen me comment here and there‚Äîmostly just trying to offer a different angle or correct something if I can. I try to be respectful and low-key about it. I‚Äôm not here to argue or ‚Äúown‚Äù anyone. I just care about facts, and I try to approach things with some humility and decency‚Äîlike I know a lot of people here do too.

I was born in New York and grew up in Clarkstown‚Äîwent to public school here, played sports, made friends I‚Äôm still close with. My parents immigrated from India and chose to raise me in this town, and I‚Äôm really grateful for that. I‚Äôm in my 30s now and work as a physician, but  I‚Äôve been feeling more and more like I can‚Äôt just sit on the sidelines while things feel this divided and angry and it feels like my hometown and this country is moving backwards instead of forward. 

There‚Äôs this podcast I listen to called The Necessary Conversation (https://www.youtube.com/@TheNecessaryConversation)‚Äîbasically%E2%80%94basically), two liberal siblings talk politics every week with their very conservative, very pro-Trump parents. It‚Äôs raw, kind of messy, and somehow still really meaningful. It got me wondering if we could try something like that here, just‚Ä¶ in real life.

If anyone‚Äôs open to it, I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee sometime‚Äîjust one-on-one, no agenda, not a debate. Just a conversation about what‚Äôs going on in the country or whatever else is on your mind. Evenings or weekends. I‚Äôll buy the coffee. No cameras, no content, no hidden motive. I‚Äôm not trying to run for anything or make money off of this. I just want to actually hear people out and maybe learn something from it. Maybe you can learn something from me too. I think I'm a pretty reasonable and patient person, and you might enjoy speaking with me.

I lean center-left politically, but that‚Äôs not really the point. I just care about this town and the people in it, and I want to believe we can still talk to each other without everything turning into a fight. If you‚Äôve ever felt the same way‚Äîeven a little‚ÄîI‚Äôd really be interested in chatting. Message me if you‚Äôre up for it. And if not, that‚Äôs totally fine too. Thanks for reading.""",9,1751984332.0,Rockland,11,0.84,False

I no longer dream
of the gold and silver sky.

The dream, instead,
is leftover lives
I didn‚Äôt get a chance to experience‚Äî
except in repeat.

Like old shows
on TV
at my grandma‚Äôs house.

In life,
days pass
with no more
than a few cups of coffee
and cigarettes
stomped out
after opening my eyes.

Complacency is a companion
that serves me still‚Äî
a convent pet
that sits in the corners,
echoing thoughts back at me.

I remember
running scared down alleys,
looking up
all the while
being yelled at
about where to go.

Ducking to hide,
I swallowed my breath‚Äî
their voice behind me:
""Don‚Äôt stop running again.""

The streets
belted with wind
as thin mist
runs sideways
down sidewalks
that hold shining stones,
glistening.

I would find
a bird of prey
every time.

Always
just some chick alone
under the towering building
just left of the obelisk.

A voice from the rooftops
imploring me
not to leave
and find them food.

I never do.
Neither does the maintenance man‚Äî
the one with mirrored, photo-red eyes.

Instead,
I go to the patio
with the broken bird fountain
perched just above
the bricked, graffitied dumpsters.

Age-pocked
with green moss
and gray streaks‚Äî
it never seems to decay.

From its plateau,
a view over
the private club fence
where they feed
on naked man.

Sometimes
the rail breaks
and I crash through the trees,
spilling out
to the parking lot
as she looks for a lighter
and the door slams shut
behind her.

Always
the oboe plays
at the corner crosswalk‚Äî

music I haven‚Äôt heard,
nor‚ÄîI think‚Äî
anyone after fourteen hundred.

Winding up
back
where the window falls out
on its anniversary
after our chat
and the refusal
of the chrome-plated Zippo
as a gift
I no longer needed.

Where the fire raged
from a time forgotten,
its deep smell of copper
like the top of a church,
with a hint of sadness
they make their home.

The street across
behind the abduction
is a hidden door.

Up its steps‚Äî
the library
from times
before this land
was governed.

I sat alone
within myself,
dragged through it
like the streak
of an upside-down smudge‚Äî
a face
and handprints
on the ten-foot-square glass
of the top floor
DSS building.

No more
would I be uplifted.

The handmade signs
by the shops
on Market Street
read:

THE FALL.

I had landed‚Äî
solid
and finite
this time.

The light
had gone out
like the hour
when the sun fades
and darkness
enfolds the land.

A wandering shell
that keeps living
after the love is gone.

My soul
wasn‚Äôt present.
Like a pair of old shoes‚Äî
it wore out
until nothing
there was left.

As if
a lover‚Äôs note
that simply said:

Now it‚Äôs from the heart
forever instead.

If I had said
it was okay‚Äî
would you have started
to believe in me again?

It‚Äôs been so long
that we forgot
how it looks,
how it feels
to be home.

Is this home?

Wherever
have I been?
Outside
in the air
or somewhere
within your mind?

Still the same‚Äî
just a memory,
I suppose.

Too close
a treason.
Perhaps
it should have started
forgotten.

As it stands now,
there is some place
between living
and dreaming.

1luppzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1luppzx/nutrition_plan_for_sf_marathon_feedback/,Nutrition plan for sf marathon feedback,"I‚Äôm heading into taper for the sf marathon. Trying to dial in my nutrition plan, looking for some feedback.

During my 20 mile long runs I‚Äôve been doing the following with not much stomach issues. 

Maurten 320 1 hour before
1 small cup of coffee 
1 slice of sourdough with peanut butter and honey 

During run:

3 caf gels (sis or Maurten)
2 sis gels non caf 

1 caf pills during 
2 salt stick tablets during

This will be my third marathon and the last two I‚Äôve had quad tightness usually around mile 22 or so.  I‚Äôm thinking about upping the salt sticks tablets during - to get more sodium in me and possibly another caffein pill.  Any guidance on the additional tablets? 

My last marathon was about 3:50 (Oakland), this will be more hilly so not sure if I will be able to beat that although I feel like I‚Äôve had a pretty good training block (8:15 pace at 20 mile flat long run).
