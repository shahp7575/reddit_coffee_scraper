Or just incredibly unlucky???,"I don't even know why I'm writing this. I think I'm too much in my own head, but I need to get it out so I'm just gonna rant here.

For the life of me I can't seem to find someone who likes me. I'm 19 male in college so I know I'm young, but I haven't even had a silly highschool fling, and I honestly just want a relationship. (I'm attracted to women btw forgot to mention)

Anyway here's a crap ton of information about me over analyze:

Physically: 19 Male 6'2"" Skinny, yet have muscles. (No abs but who really has those.) (I'm stronger than I look, people have said) I shoot archery which isn't that physical of a sport but still requires focus and certain muscle training. I attend a weekly yoga club. I have danced in stage plays before. I work out almost everyday, whole body, with focus on shoulders, arms, and back (archery muscles) and cardio. Also I have good hands eye coordination. I carry myself high, if im in a rush, then I'll carry myself in a rush. But unless is pouring rain all day and slush is everywhere outside I never mope around feeling sorry for myself.

Appearance: Straight Brown hair with brown eyes. Hair is nearly cut, although sometimes gets grown out. (Used to be bleached at the tips, might to that again, cuz I like the look). Clean shaven face. Long eyelashes, thick eyebrows,(I don't think these matters but everybody says that about me). Nice teeth (people say as well, my grandfather's a dentist so I guess it makes sense). I shower with shampoo and body wash every night. Brush my teeth every night and morning. Clip my nails whenever needed.

Intellect: Currently attending college for my dream career. Speak fluent English and a little of Spanish and ASL. Mainly book smarts and a college level understanding of most topics. Special interest in paleontology and animals (so I know alot of random information about that and the environment). However I can be ditsy at times, I've noticed.

Personality: A little bit nerdy, (I like Nintendo games). One of the weird devil spawn introverted extroverts, who gets more active around people I'm comfortable with. fun goofy attitude, i get unserous when I want to and when the time is right. But when I'm upset or tired I get very serious and don't mess around. I know who I am and I'm comfortable with myself. I get excited about things I really like, and will give things I don't like a few tries before giving up. Often take charge within the friend group, as I'm the biggest so I have to talk to the people at the store and ask the questions (everyone in my friend group is very introverted). I'm respectful to everyone. I have a great group of friends in real life and online. Hate smoking and drugs and alcohol. I really do love myself, and I know who I am, but it gets really lonely sometimes. Confident in myself, but I do get nervous sometimes like everyone else on the planet.

Skills: Acting/voice acting (have stared in many shows during college and highschool). Sports/physical activity. Building. Cooking. Writing. Drawing. Anything hands on really. Worked retail so I know people skills.

Ok probably forgetting stuff but that's me in a reddit post.

Anyway whenever I meet a new girl I'm very upfront about who I am, and I'll tell them most of this information if we meet in person. I don't try and pretend to be cool and slick. But none of them seem to stay.

The last date I went on, was pretty good I thoughy, we got coffee and chatted for about 2 hours. But then she lost interest and I just stopped texting and never heard back. She then made an Instagram post today about how she matched with someone on a dating site, so now I know how she feels about me.

Same with this terrible girl I went out with for a little (never dated because I realized how crazy she was). I just saw her with some new fling, but she's really not a good person. So how do they keep getting guys to like them??? Same with those sleazy gym bros, I just don't get it.

I never do anything I'm not supposed to when meeting a girl. I ask her questions about herself and actively listen to what she's saying. And answer honestly when she asks.

I have a type, but I don't specifically only date girls like that. I don't believe in people being in sperate leagues either, if I find a girl pretty and nice I'll ask her out. If it's a no, so be it.

I've never had a second date so I have no experience with taking someone out to an activity like Ice skating or something. Because I like taking the first date slow and just getting to know someone better.

I meet girls in person or online, It really just depends how it happens. I don't use dating apps, but if I end up talking to one one social media and if the conversation goes well. I'll ask them if they want to meet in person to get to know each other better, and for a formal introduction.

I guess it's overall just bad luck. But it's getting really frustrating. Probably just the biology talking, but I want to care for someone. Am I doing something wrong when meeting women? And I not showing them how great I am, or am I being too boring by just wanting to take it slow.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for reading all this by the way. It's super long but I needed to rant. Oh I also left out one piece of information

	•	The dos and don’ts when visiting a coffeeshop,
	•	Amsterdam’s cannabis culture and customer habits,
	•	Tips for first-timers, or

1i5oo2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i5oo2y/aita_for_not_understanding_why_mom_thought_i_was/,AITA for not understanding why mom thought I was selfish,"So I'm a 17 year old with another two younger siblings (9 and 14). My youngest sibling is currently sick and mom took today off work to stay with them. On saturday I went to a punk concert with a bunch of my friends and badly sprained my whole left arm in the most pit. I admit, it wasn't smart at all and I should've been more careful.
Mom told me how my doctor works and I have afternoon school this week, so she told me I'd go see my doctor Monday morning (today). I later asked if i can go geab a coffee with a friend I don't see often and she said I can only if I go see my doctor by myself. I agreed.
When I came home around 10 pm Sunday night, she told me she's driving our dog to a per care place next(this) morning so she'll drop me off at the clinic. She did just that that but when she dropped the dog off she came and waited for my turn at the doctor's. She spent about an hour there before she left to pick up our dog and drive him home.
Before she left she told me to call her and let her know when I'm done so she can pick me up and drive me to the hospiral for the x-ray. I askwd if she was sure because I thought I was gonna take the bus to the hospital. I did offer to take the bus and go by myself, but she said no and that she'd pick me up. Then she spent another 3 hours walking and waiting in the hospital with me, until the results came. Nothing broken, just sprained.
On the drive home she started attacking me about how selfish I am (keep in mind she was calm up until that point), so I calmly asked why was I selfish. And she stopped, pulled over to the side of the road and yelled at me to get out of the car. I told her I'm not getting out and walking half a city to get home, she then ckntinued driving but kept attacking me. She kept yelling at me for being selfish towards my friends and family and everyone around me and she told me im too shallow to understand it. (My friends tell me im quote literally never selfish except when i have to be for my own wellbeing) I was visibly confused. I told her I do appreciate that she came with me and I thanked her for it, but also mentioned the fact I'd offered her to go home and not waste time on this so I don't understand why she's taking her anger out on me like that. The rest of the drive was silent.
AITA for not understanding how I was being selfish?

Update: 
Not even a half hour after posting this she came to my room and told me to come downstairs and eat. I was writing a response to a comment so I said I'd be down in a few minutes. She got angry again and told me to come eat and that I'd have to go to school cause she wouldn't excuse my abscence in class today, even though she said she would earlier.

Gross), and I have 2 part time jobs.  One job pays all the bills, the other is to pay off credit card debts.  Times are tough, I don't make a whole lot of money, and I'm really trying to concentrate on lowering my debts quickly and create a little savings so I'm not working till I die of old age at work.  Everything is just going up in price and I don't think it'll be changing anytime soon.  I have 2 credit cards nearing max, and my goal is to have them at zero (or near zero) by December 2025.  It's going to be tough, but I'm going to do everything I can to make that happen.

I decided earlier this month I need to pull back on my extra spending.  Over the weekend, I got rid of Netflix and Disney Plus.  Cliche thinking, I know, but that's about $28/month I'll be saving.  I have access to free streaming services and will be using that instead.  I still have my Amazon Prime account which provides me with streaming.  I use Amazon to find deals on household items, so paying for Prime is actually worth it for me.  Next was to get rid of all subscriptions in Amazon unless absolutely necessary.  Some stuff I know is cheaper online than in-store, but my new plan is go to the stores when I'm running out of something (soaps, cleaners, etc...) and see if there's an item on sale or is it cheaper online before ordering.  I recently got rid of using toilet paper and bought reusable/washable cloth.  Used in conjunction with my bidet, it's not as bad as it sounds, and saves me about $20/month.  I also plan to start making my own laundry soap, and I found a homemade recipe for air freshener/fabric freshener that uses the same ingredients as the laundry soap.  I'm going to reduce going out to restaurants/coffee shops too. I stopped drinking juice/pop and sticking to water, coffee, tea.  I do the bookkeeping for a local restaurant that allows one free meal a shift, so I'll be using that instead of packing a lunch.  I got a vacuum seal thingy at Christmas to freeze foods, so I'll probably buy meats in bulk to save money too.

What kinds of things are you all sacrificing?  I'd love to know so I can have more ideas on how to get rid of my debts a lot faster.",4,1737374361.0,povertyfinancecanada,1,1.0,False

There are many flavors/spices you can add the simple coffee, but there was something with great benefits.

NUTMEG!!!

Below is extracted from AI is confirmed they can be found online as authentic   

Adding nutmeg to your coffee not only enhances its flavor but also offers several potential health benefits:

1. Rich in Antioxidants
	•	Nutmeg is packed with antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress, protecting your cells from damage caused by free radicals.

2. Improves Digestion
	•	Nutmeg can stimulate the secretion of digestive enzymes, helping with bloating, gas, and indigestion.

3. Anti-Inflammatory Properties
	•	Contains compounds that may reduce inflammation, which is beneficial for overall health and chronic conditions.

4. Boosts Brain Health
	•	Nutmeg contains myristicin and macelignan, compounds that are believed to improve memory and cognitive function. It’s traditionally used as a brain tonic in some cultures.

5. Promotes Relaxation
	•	Known for its calming properties, nutmeg may help reduce stress and improve sleep quality. A small amount in coffee can balance its stimulating effects.

6. Supports Oral Health
	•	Nutmeg has antibacterial properties that may help combat oral bacteria, reducing bad breath and improving oral hygiene.

7. May Enhance Heart Health
	•	Contains minerals like magnesium, potassium, and calcium, which are important for maintaining a healthy heart and regulating blood pressure.

Note:

The living room is more than just a space; it’s the soul of your home. Whether you use it for relaxing, entertaining, or family gatherings, the right furniture can transform it into a functional and stylish haven. Let’s explore the latest living room furniture trends and practical tips to help you design a space that’s both beautiful and efficient.

# Current Trends in Living Room Furniture

1. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Materials Homeowners are increasingly choosing furniture made from sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood, bamboo, and recycled metals. Eco-friendly upholstery fabrics like organic cotton and hemp are also gaining popularity, offering a natural aesthetic that’s good for the planet.
2. Bold Colors and Patterns Say goodbye to neutral tones dominating the living room. In 2025, rich hues like emerald green, deep navy, and burnt orange are making a statement. Complement these with geometric or cultural patterns on cushions and rugs to add character.
3. Multi-Functional Furniture As homes adapt to smaller spaces, versatile furniture is a must. Think sectional sofas with hidden storage, foldable coffee tables, or chairs that double as beds. These pieces maximize functionality while keeping the room organized.
4. Curved Designs Softer, rounded furniture shapes are trending this year. Curved sofas, circular coffee tables, and arched bookshelves create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
5. Technology Integration Smart furniture is no longer futuristic. Coffee tables with wireless charging, recliners with built-in USB ports, and sofas with Bluetooth speakers bring convenience and innovation to your living room.

# Essential Living Room Furniture Pieces

* Sofa: The centerpiece of any living room, a sofa should be both comfortable and stylish. Choose one that suits your space, whether it’s a large sectional for big families or a compact loveseat for smaller apartments.
* Coffee Table: A coffee table anchors the room. opt for one with storage compartments to keep clutter at bay.
* TV Stand or Media Console: For those who enjoy movie nights, a sturdy and sleek TV stand is essential. Look for options with cord management and storage for electronics.
* Accent Chairs: Add extra seating with stylish accent chairs. These can also serve as decorative elements.
* Bookshelves: Display your favorite reads or decorative items on bookshelves that match your room’s design.

# Tips for Choosing Furniture for Your Living Room

1. Assess Your Needs: Consider how you use your living room. Do you entertain guests often, or is it a space primarily for relaxation? Your furniture choices should reflect its purpose. A well-planned furniture layout can help you maximize the space, ensuring it suits both functionality and style. For more layout ideas that help optimize space, check out [this guide to living room furniture layouts that maximize space](https://sivaseo.in/living-room-furniture-layouts-that-maximize-space/).
2. Measure Your Space: Before purchasing, measure your living room to ensure the furniture fits perfectly. Leave enough space for easy movement. Thoughtfully arranging furniture can also play a major role in how spacious the room feels, especially in smaller areas.
3. Prioritize Comfort: While style is important, comfort should never be compromised. Test furniture before buying, especially sofas and chairs.
4. Consider Durability: Invest in high-quality materials that can withstand daily use, especially if you have kids or pets.
5. Mix Textures and Styles: Don’t be afraid to combine materials like wood, metal, and fabric. Mixing textures adds depth and visual interest.
6. Think About Lighting: Your furniture should complement the room’s lighting. Lighter furniture can brighten up darker spaces, while darker pieces add warmth to well-lit rooms.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Overcrowding: Avoid stuffing your living room with too much furniture. Focus on key furniture items and ensure there's enough room for comfortable movement.
* Ignoring Proportions: Ensure your furniture is proportionate to the room size. Oversized pieces in a small space can make it feel cramped.
* Neglecting Storage: Choose furniture with storage options to keep your living room organized and clutter-free.
* Chasing Every Trend: Focus on timeless pieces that reflect your personal style rather than following trends blindly.

# Conclusion

Living room furniture is more than just functional; it sets the tone for your home’s ambiance. By embracing sustainable materials, bold designs, and smart functionality, you can create a living room that’s stylish, comfortable, and uniquely yours. Take your time to plan, invest in quality, and enjoy the process of designing a space where memories are made.

We don’t live in the same country (he’s in Korea), but I travel there often—most recently this past December. While we were texting, he said things like, “I hope December comes soon,” but then when I was actually there, nothing significant happened.

We hung out once—we went to a coffee shop and a photobooth. We talked a lot, and I even told him I wanted to sleep with him (I know, bold move). He said, “Doing it without feelings isn’t that great,” but after a while, he asked me why I wanted to. I admitted I had a crush on him, and then he said, “Can we go to your Airbnb? I wanna see all your tattoos.” At the time, I said no (I know, I’m terrible at reading between the lines).

After our meeting, he went to work (he works at a bar), and I went back to my friends. After talking it over with them, I changed my mind about the Airbnb. I went to his bar to tell him, but after a few minutes of chatting, he got a phone call and left, saying something urgent had come up.

I visit his bar often, and my friends agree that he looks at me a lot and always smiles when he sees me. But I’m not sure—maybe he’s just being friendly because of his job?

I’ll be going back to Seoul in May, and I don’t know if I should move on or wait and see if there’s still hope.

1i5odkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i5odkk/im_29f_breaking_up_with_my_man_38m_today/,I'm 29f breaking up with my man 38m today.,"He's wonderful, I love him, but I'm ready to move on. Him and I are WAY too different and I often find my feelings hurt over things that don't mean anything to him. We just have different morals, religious and personal views, and see things from two different perspectives (plus there is 9 years in between us). But last night I found out he was texting other women and while not outright cheating, I'm very uncomfortable with what I found. 

I'm writing because two things
1.) Heartbreak syndrome
2.) Need encouragement to do this

1.) I have been blessed to always have done the breaking up in this life. But that doesn't make it hurt any less. I barely survived my last breakup, even though I wanted it, I still felt weak, throw up, need a whole week or two of complete isolation&fasting before I feel my mental state has recovered enough to be a person again. This time is different however, because I am living in his house without anywhere for me to go. I have a shitty job that barely pays enough And I'll have to wait for my taxes to move out. So I'm going to ask to stay until March 1, which I'm sure he will agree with. But how to go through Heartbreak when I'm living with the man? How to be so in love and obsessed only to cut it off? How can I turn down my feelings this time so I can manage this living situation? Please I will take any advice 🥺 

I woke up every morning to make his breakfast, brew his coffee, and pack his lunch. Always have a snack ready for him when he gets home, a fresh meal for dinner every night! I have tummy problems so I have to cook everything from scratch. How can I occupy this time without feeling immense heartbreak, or should I continue doing them to feel better? I LOVE taking care of other humans, it fulfills me. But I know how that he's not the one for me. 


Also I don't have any friends, online or in person. I only text him and my mom, only. I am to anxious to have friends, and it's been that way for over 10 years. So I have a very small support system/none at all


2.) This is the third time I am trying this. The other two times we didn't stay broken up for more than two hours. I have intensive love for him, he's very attractive, and he let's me stay home and be a traditional woman. My life here is extremely comfortable. But we are not for each other. I am constantly hurt by actions he takes that he doesn't believe should hurt me, he doesn't understand what I need in a relationship to feel secure. I feel like my mental state is going to shit bc he doesn't love me in a way that registers with me. I feel I need constant praise love and attention, and that's what I give out too. But he's not that kind of man. He is an absolute wonderful person, just not the one for me. The issue is it's so hard to leave and stick with it because leaving means starting over from complete scratch. I have no resources here or parents, they are in another state. It's much easier fall back into place even being so unhappy. But this time I am absolutely sure this is the right decision for me. How can I keep myself from going back again this time? I still love him dearly but I recognize that this isn't right for either of us. I'm so lost, sick, and sad.


TLDR; how to deal with heartbreak syndrome? Also how to leave somebody you don't necessarily want to leave? 


This was so freaking long, thank you for anybody who read this and comments! I am so alone. ",1,1737373459.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1i5o9cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/workout/comments/1i5o9cr/help_w_diet_to_burn_fat_and_gain_muscle/,Help w/ diet to burn fat and gain muscle,"I’m male, turning 40, 6’4”, 265lbs, and can’t seem to figure out my diet to burn fat and gain muscle. 

I was always a bit overweight, started working out and eating better ~ 6 years ago, dropped from 290 to 240 over 2 years, focusing on weight loss not so much muscle gain. I had the most success with jogging, intermittent fasting, and cutting the carbs/sugars. Jogging started taking its toll on my knees so started lifting more, enjoyed it, so wanted to gain some muscle. 

My challenge has been dialing in my diet. At first I was dumb and was lifting without eating a lot of carbs and in a calorie deficit. Which left me starving by the end of the day and I would often splurge right before bed…which led to weight gain. When I try to get more intentional w/ my diet, counting calories/carbs/ protein, and spreading out throughout the day, I do a little better. However, adding in just a little carbs puts the weight back on me. I’m talking just basic rice and oatmeal. 

My daily diet consists of a protein shake and eggs in the morning, protein shakes and bars and peanut butter throughout the day, lean meat and veggies for dinner, sometimes rice. I usually hit 250g of protein a day. My weak spot is late night where I’ll often fall to fruit and Atkins snacks because I’m starving. I don’t drink, only water and coffee, but I go out for tacos Friday night lol.

I jog every morning, lift weights every other morning. I have a desk job so not very active the rest of the day, but try to go for walks after dinner. 

So I just need help with my diet with the goal of putting on muscle and burning fat. I can lose weight cutting the carbs and sugars, but then I can’t gain muscle. If I try to increase carbs/calories, I gain way more fat than muscle. 

Any advice on how many calories to eat if it’s pretty clean and I’m eating 250g of protein a day, jogging every morning, and lifting every other day? I swear it shouldn’t be this complicated but this has been a 6 year journey and I still can’t figure it out lol.

Grampa was an engineer (designer, not railway) and Gramma bucked rivets in an aircraft assembly plant during the war.  She ran the cosmetics department in a small, local drugstore.  

They loved us SO much—and we them!  They came for every birthday and we went to their house for holiday meals.  They took all four of us (boys) out for dinners and for long car rides.  Gone since 1993, I miss them both!

But they drank coffee and Grampa smoked a pipe 😳!  And they were better humans than a lot of the people at church.  “Don’t worry,” my mom would always say, “they’ll accept the Gospel in the Spirit World.”  Little kid me: But…but…but…why not now? SHELF.

She doesn’t know I know (what do I do/say)? ,"Well… I don’t know how to start this off. I started dating a woman 3 years ago before I was abruptly deployed. To me she was my first serious girlfriend, I guess I got clowned???

We dated for probably 4 months before I deployed. Around 5 months into my deployment I cut contact with the intent to re-engage— things got bad and we were always upset with each other. We stayed in touch in and out following the deployment just to check in. I only met one of her friends and I also met one of her sisters but, she introduced me as a coworker which I thought was EXTREMELY weird but we also just started seeing each other. She was always closed off and quiet… shy even I originally thought she was just really timid and quirky which I liked. She wasn’t on any social media that I knew of. There were so many other things that I was just like “huh, STRANGE, but whatever she’s my girl”. Some of them were small and some of them were “big” like her being a virgin when we first met or at least claiming to be. Looking back, 90% the time if we weren’t at my place we got a hotel room. 

The BIGGEST red flag: when I was overseas, I didn’t hear from her for days… I couldn’t really occupy my thoughts with “what’s going on”, I had a team to lead and people that looked up to me. A full 7 days pass … I finally decide to hit up her sister on Instagram… I basically said “hey, not sure if you remember me but we met …. I haven’t heard from your sister…kind of worried, is she alright”? Her response was something like “who are you to her”? 

I thought that was really weird and dint follow through I just left her on open and blocked. 

Earlier in the summer we talked briefly but that stopped. She ever mentioned being married and we literally talked about dating.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago back in December I reached out. We met up for coffee and ended up grabbing lunch too. It was amazing. Seeing her again on Tuesday. 

In a moment of boredom… I was just thinking about her and did some googling, I don’t know what triggered me to do this now but I did. AND SHES FU*KING MARRIED. She’s been married since 2019!!!! We met in 2022. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL. 

I have to say this doesn’t really change anything, my feelings for her are the same and I feel like I’m finally in a place where I can make things work — I couldn’t before. 

**TLDR: she’s married has been since long before we started dating / broke up. What should I do/say? How do I approach this?**

She’s struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. Definitely some underlying condition there but she’s the doctor… so like whatever I’m just baffled. ",6,1737372511.0,AskMenAdvice,38,1.0,False
1i5o4xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i5o4xz/could_a_relationship_between_a_37f_and_a_27m_work/,Could a relationship between a 37F and a 27M work? ,"

I (37F) started dating Robert (27M) a couple of months ago. It all began as just fun since I’ve always believed that for a relationship to work, the man should be older than the woman. The idea of taking him seriously never even crossed my mind.

I manage a busy 24/7 coffeehouse, and one typical Friday night, I was about to call the police on a group of rowdy, drunk young men. Suddenly, a muscular redhead wearing a gun on his belt stepped in and, with just a few firm looks, had them out the door. That scene definitely triggered some primal instincts. At that time, I had also decided it was time to re-enter the dating world after taking a year-long break to focus on myself following a tough breakup. I put on some makeup that night, went back out, and resolved to have fun again.

I’ve always been an independent woman. I moved to the other side of the world on my own at 18 with just three suitcases and $100, and I’ve built a good life for myself. My focus has always been on my career, with the goal of achieving financial independence before settling down and starting a family. I also look much younger than my age, thanks to sunscreen, genetics, a little Botox, and constantly being on my feet at work. Because of this, younger guys often hit on me, assuming I’m their age.

Robert is sweet and has a sharp, spicy sense of humor that doesn’t sit well with people obsessed with political correctness. He moved here on his own at the same age I did, so we bonded over the similar challenges we faced in early adulthood. He enlisted in the army and has done very well, as he’s part of an elite unit. He’s highly motivated, intelligent, and the type of guy you just know is going places. He’s also the kind of person who would help a 90-year-old granny carry her bags up the stairs, make her laugh with a flirty joke, and leave her blushing.

After texting for a few days and grabbing coffee a couple of times, I found myself wondering why someone like him, who could have any woman he wanted, was pursuing me—a woman 10 years older. After ruling out stupidity or mental illness, I decided to just enjoy what felt like a gift from the universe.

The physical connection was mind-blowing (as you’d expect from a 27-year-old—yay!), and we quickly began spending more time together. What surprised me was how well-read and mature he turned out to be—more so than many older men I’ve dated. We had deep, meaningful conversations in between the physical connection, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying his company on multiple levels. I stopped overthinking and let myself live in the moment.

As time went on, we began spending almost all our free time together. We never explicitly labeled our relationship but naturally fell into being a couple. We created this little honeymoon bubble where we disconnected from the world and just enjoyed each other’s company, sleeping together almost every night.

Now, two months in, we’re ridiculously happy. We’re the kind of couple I would’ve rolled my eyes at three months ago if I’d seen them on the street. I’ve never felt so safe, supported, appreciated, and loved for who I truly am. He’s a breath of fresh air and the best warm embrace. For the first time, I don’t even crave my alone time anymore. He’s seamlessly integrated into my life, and I’ve never been happier.

But two nights ago, we were talking about his future plans, and I asked where he saw himself in 10 years. As he painted this detailed picture of his goals, I realized that starting a family wasn’t anywhere on his horizon. That’s when it hit me: of course, he’s only 27. It makes sense that he’s not thinking about that right now.

I didn’t let the thought linger and told him directly that his vision didn’t include something I won’t be able to provide in 10 years—children. He had previously mentioned wanting a big family, including both biological and adopted kids. To make that happen, we’d need to start very soon.

The pink bubble burst, and for the first time, we acknowledged that we might have an expiration date. We had a calm, mature conversation. He admitted that he’d already considered this and that, while he’d love to have kids with me, he’s not ready—financially or career-wise. He also doesn’t want to take away the opportunity for me to experience motherhood in the way I’ve always envisioned.

His reaction was deeply moving. Seeing his heartbreak made me realize just how special what we have is. We decided not to rush to a decision but to take some time to think things through. He left on a work trip this morning, so I have time to process everything.

I know the logical choice is to end things now to avoid getting more attached and facing an even harder breakup later. We could both find partners who align with our life stages. But we feel such a deep sense of loss at the thought of ending things that I can’t help but wonder: Should I give this a chance for a limited period of time and see where it leads, or rip the Band-Aid off now to save myself from a deeper heartbreak later?

It all began with great intensity. We met frequently, and within the first month, I had already met his friends, to whom he introduced me as the guy he was going out with. Within the first month, we also had sex. Overall, things seemed to be progressing well. That said, I noticed some reservations on his part early on. He mentioned a few things—like how I can be mopey at times, how he’s more attracted to masculine men, and that he wished I could drive. Despite these remarks, he continued to show interest, and things carried on.

Over time, though, I noticed a shift. He stopped initiating plans as much, and I found myself taking the lead in setting up plans. There weren’t any direct signs of disinterest—he never said anything to make me feel like he wasn’t into me, and followed me every time I planned something. By this time, I had begun to invest more in the relationship. I’d go out of my way to do thoughtful things for him. I’d pick him up and drop him off (using a cab or my driver), buy him gifts, and bring him coffee or food after his work shifts. I even hired him to do my mom’s and my makeup because he was struggling to get consistent work as a makeup artist. The turning point was when he rocked the boat. For instance, even though we spent a lot of time together and he enjoyed the perks of my company, he pointed out things he didn’t like about me—such as my tendency to show extra affection in public. He also told me he hadn’t caught feelings for me yet, though he knew I had strong feelings for him. Nonetheless, he did not say he wants to stop going out with me, just that he needs some time to develop feelings. Even after that conversation, we continued spending time together. He came to a house party at my friend’s place, attended a Pride event with me, and joined me for a live music night, where we exchanged a few kisses. On the way back, he rested his head on my shoulder and kissed my neck goodnight, which felt affectionate and sweet.

But yesterday, I decided to have an honest conversation with him. I told him I needed more effort from him and asked him how he felt about us. That’s when he admitted that he didn’t want to take things further. He said he had come to this realization in the past few days. He mentioned that I’m not the type of guy he’s into—he prefers manlier, “studly” men—and that my mopey tendencies, overthinking, and “feminine energy” clash with his own. He also said that while he had been hopeful he’d develop feelings for me, it just didn’t happen. He added that he could tell how strongly I felt about him and that even his friends had noticed.

In the end, he told me he just wanted to be friends. I, on the other hand, have not decided anything yet. I dropped him home and cried a lot when I was on the way with him. I have been feeling disappointed, disillusioned and hurt.",6,1737372377.0,LGBTindia,2,1.0,False

I just want to start by saying I’m really cautious because of past experiences (I was cheated on), so I’m trying hard not to overthink things.

I met a girl on Bumble last week, and we really hit it off. I ended up telling her I deleted my dating apps, and she said she did the same. So far, so good, right? But then, a few days later, I re-downloaded Bumble to check if her account was still active (I know, I’m overthinking). When I checked, her account was deactivated, and her profile picture was gone, but our conversation was still there, which made me feel better.

Yesterday, we met for coffee and had a nice time together. Afterward, she left to help her sister, and we were planning to go to a gig later in the evening. When it was time to leave for the gig, she texted me saying she wasn’t feeling up to it and that her head wasn’t in a good place. I told her I understood and that I was here if she needed someone to talk to.

Since then, I’ve messaged her a few times to check if she’s okay, but she hasn’t replied. This morning, I checked Bumble again, and her account is completely gone from my chats.

In the wake of SCOTUS's decision in *Trump v. Anderson*, I went online like plenty of other people and read about the decision second-hand.  I watched several videos where constitutional scholars, former DOJ officials, and other authoritative individuals went into great detail about how SCOTUS's decision prevents the 14th Amendment from disqualifying DJT.  In other words, I did everything I could to avoid reading Trump v. Anderson because legalese can sometimes induce migraines, and I wasn't terribly eager to look at it.

I eventually found a nifty scholarly article that explained *Trump v. Anderson*:

**William Baude and Michael Stokes Paulsen, Sweeping Section Three under the Rug: A Comment on Trump v. Anderson, Harvard Law Review, September 10, 2024,** [**https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4952397**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4952397) 

This part caught my attention.

https://preview.redd.it/6ph5uxiil4ee1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d161a7472872ff3f7ed31424948d5fe34961959

To clarify, SCOTUS did not ""touch"" anything dealing with Trump's constitutional ineligibility.  They did rule that the 14th Amendment Section 3 requires legislation in order for it to be functionally enforced.

(Taking a step back, that means the 14th Amendment can still maintain its self-invoking elements.  It is just missing prescriptive language for enforcement.  That is not a bad thing because if the Constitution had one recipe for handling insurrectionists, it might not adapt well to the times.  The part of the 14th Amendment that *does* have prescriptive language is the amnesty part--for removing the disqualification--which requires 2/3rds votes in both Houses. )  


Then in December, I actually took the time to read *Trump v. Anderson* as well as the Colorado court case *Anderson v. Griswold*.  I was shocked to learn that both cases were readily comprehensible.  There was a key passage in *Trump v. Anderson* that inspired this entire endeavor.

[ https:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/23pdf\/23-719\_19m2.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/dn1v97kpl4ee1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=10b516fb3a54ddbda61438053ed296e1d6231072)

So I went online and looked up the Enforcement Act of 1870 and got this little gem:

[https:\/\/en.wikisource.org\/wiki\/Enforcement\_Act\_of\_1870  ](https://preview.redd.it/udhzu9a0m4ee1.png?width=718&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8f3456376a3bd7b707def263e53b2443897d52e)

What do we have here?  Did SCOTUS basically give everyone the *recipe for enforcement?*  Did they spell out what everyone needed to do in *Trump v. Anderson*\--right there in plain sight?  Did they just HELP US?    
  
 How did those authoritative scholars and others miss this?   It's right friggin' there!  Look at it!   The solution.

Now at this stage, when I was discussing stuff with my team, there was a lot of back-and-forth about whether an Enforcement Act was required in order for the 14th Amendment Section 3 to be implemented.  One of them mentioned how important it was for the Civil Rights Acts to be passed in order to carry out other constitutional amendments.  I thought that made a great point.  The selfsame Enforcement Act of 1870 actually was a Civil Rights Act and had other portions that did that very thing.  

So, we drew up a proposal for legislation.  We figured that we'd leverage the amnesty part with the enforcement part so that the bill ""works"" even if it doesn't pass.  Technically if someone votes ""nay""--they would be voting NOT to have an amnesty vote to remove DJT's disqualification.  If they vote ""yay""--then they are voting to imperil DJT's ambitions if he loses the amnesty vote (in other words, enforcement).  \*twiddles fingers\* (I know the world of politics isn't that simple, but it's a great start.)

Still we were perplexed, since if DJT gets removed, then our least favorite person, the illustrious couch-svengali gets installed because of succession rules in the constitution.  

Then a Christmas gift appeared:  **Evan A. Davis and David M. Schulte, Congress has the power to block Trump from taking office, but lawmakers must act now, December 26, 2024,** [**https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5055171-constitution-insurrection-trump-disqualification/**](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/5055171-constitution-insurrection-trump-disqualification/)

So we tried to work out how we could leverage nullification of Electoral Votes due to constitutional disqualification in order to call for a Special Election. 

The only lead we had was James E. White's blurb.

Then some *abracadabra--alakazam*, and the Amnesty & Enforcement Bill Proposal was born!  (Literally just a cut & paste job.  Don't hate.)

An Act to Remove the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability of Donald J. Trump

|To Remove the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability of Donald J. Trump or Otherwise Enforce the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability.   *Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,* |

 **PREAMBLE****:** WHEREAS the Colorado Supreme Court formerly determined that Donald J. Trump was ineligible to run for President of the United States in *Anderson v. Griswold*, 2023 CO 63 (2024).  WHEREAS the facts found at trial showed that then-President Donald Trump, having sworn an oath to support the Constitution as president to preserve, protect, and defend the U.S. constitution--had subsequently “engaged in” conduct constituting “insurrection or rebellion” against the U.S. constitutional order in an attempt to overthrow the lawful result of the presidential election of 2020, including by summoning a mob of supporters to Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 and inciting them to attack the capitol, with the goal of preventing the electoral count from certifying Trump’s lawful defeat in that same *Anderson v. Griswold*, No. 2023CV32577, 2023 WL 8006216, at \*1 (Colo.Dist.Ct. Nov. 17, 2023).  WHEREAS the Supreme Court of the United States determined that States lack power to enforce Section Three—of the 14^(th) Amendment in state-conducted elections for federal elective office, but did NOT hold that Trump *was eligible* *to hold office* under the standards of Section Three; did NOT say that the Colorado Supreme Court was wrong in any way on the point of ineligibility—in fact, the Supreme Court did not deny the ultimate legal conclusions of the Colorado courts.  The Supreme Court also did not challenge the “self-executing” nature of Section Three’s constitutional ban. 

WHEREAS the 117 Congress, H.Res.24. January 2021 Impeachment determined by majority vote that Donald J. Trump had committed insurrection despite not having the 2/3rds Senate majority required to conclude the impeachment, the self-executing nature of Amendment 14 Section Three becomes all the more solidified.

  
WHEREAS the Office of President of the United States is stated plainly as an “office” in its very definition in Article II Section One of the United States Constitution at least nine times.  WHEREAS the Office of the President of the United States is considered an “office” in innumerable documents and Supreme Court proceedings, which establish precedent—including *Trump v. United States* where the point of “official acts” of the Office of President were the basis of the entire finding. 

**Section 1**: Be it enacted, That any person who shall hereafter knowingly accept or hold any office under the United States, including the office of President and Vice President, or office of any State to which they are ineligible under the third section of the fourteenth article of amendment of the Constitution of the United States, or who shall attempt to hold or exercise the duties of any such office, shall be deemed guilty of a felony against the United States, and, upon conviction thereof before the circuit or district court of the United States, shall be imprisoned not less than one year, the length to be determined at the discretion of the court.

**Section 2:** Be it further enacted that Congress will hold a vote in both Houses three (3) days after passage in order to determine whether the impediment of insurrection will be lifted from Donald J. Trump in accordance to the prescribed methodology of Amendment 14 Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution (2/3rds majority in support in both House and Senate). 

**Section 3:** Be it further enacted that if the 2/3rds majority is not achieved in both Houses, then Donald J. Trump remains constitutionally disqualified from the presidency and may not lawfully serve in that office, or any other office and position in the federal and state governments of these United States of America.

**Section 4:**  Be it enacted that Congress rejects any electoral votes for candidates who were constitutionally ineligible to hold office in the 2024 election due to Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability. 

**Section 5:** ***(This is a part that Congress would have to workshop into actionable language)***

Creation of a bipartisan committee to review and investigate unusual ballot activity from the 2024 Presidential Election in the swing states of North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania—and how it may relate to foreign interference and stolen election software from the 2021 Coffee County break-in.  The objective is a free and fair election; to ensure that votes were tabulated accurately; and to ensure that the results accurately reflect the actual votes (acknowledging the clear and present danger of Foreign Interference—especially Russian Interference).

This same bipartisan committee would also investigate any active measures of election interference via mass disenfranchisement of registered voters during last minute voter roll purges and any *bad faith* lawsuits that relate to the election where lawsuits were used as a tool for election interference.  This should lead to another subpoena for Leonard Leo.

**Section 6:** ***(This is a part that Congress would have to workshop into actionable language)*** \[Anti-Gerrymander Bill\] Anyone knowingly disenfranchising voters on the basis of race accomplished through gerrymandering or attempting to do so—commits a crime.

**Section 7:**  And be it further enacted, that whenever any person shall be defeated or deprived of their election as President or Vice-President as the constitutional disqualification is carried out, a special election should be held in order to determine the holder for the office of President and Vice President of the United States.  This act is necessitated by the Amendment XIV Sec. 3 Disability being in place during the entire process of the 2024 election and enforces the disability for electoral votes cast for ineligible candidates.  

 

This special election would be scheduled one month after passage.

 **Section 8:** This bill shall go into effect immediately.   

  
*Copies of this bill proposal were mailed out to 12 members of the House and Senate on December 30th through first priority mail.  Follow up copies were later emailed.  Dozen of phone calls were made to those same 12 members over the past two and a half weeks.  Progress is slow....*  

*Obviously the objective was to get it to them before January 6th and definitely before January 20th.  We had no clue it took eternity to get a document into the hands of someone in Congress.  AND we are still trying to get this document into their hands--and get their staff/offices to prioritize it.  So much gatekeeping.  It's absurd.*",31,1737372026.0,somethingiswrong2024,11,0.94,False

2) What are your thoughts on the Lelit Anna model with a built-in-grinder. How much of a step-up in quality would a stand-alone grinder be and what are some alternatives that are cheaper than the DF64 Gen 2?

3) Would the 57mm portafilter of the Lelit Anna be an issue? I haven't checked for availability of portafilter/ baskets in this size.

If you’re still paying $100+ every month for a bloated package of channels you barely watch, it’s time to ask yourself: *Why?*

In 2025, there’s a better way to watch everything you love—live sports, blockbuster movies, premium channels, international shows, pay-per-view events, and more. It’s called **IPTV**, and it’s quietly taking over the entertainment world.

For as little as **$15/month**, IPTV gives you **unlimited access** to over **50,000 live channels** and **120,000+ on-demand titles**. No contracts. No hidden fees. No more overpriced bills.

I was skeptical at first, but let me tell you—I made the switch, and I’m never going back. Here’s how IPTV has completely transformed the way I watch TV, and why it can do the same for you.

# How I Stumbled Upon IPTV and Said Goodbye to Cable

It all started when I saw a Reddit post about IPTV. A user claimed they were saving hundreds of dollars a year while still watching all the live sports, movies, and shows they loved. I thought, *Yeah, right. It’s probably too good to be true.*

But the comments were overwhelmingly positive:

* “I’ve been using IPTV for 6 months—best decision ever!”
* “I saved $1,000 last year by switching. Never looking back.”
* “For $15/month, I’m getting MORE content than I did with cable.”

I figured I’d give it a try. Worst case scenario, I’d lose $15.

Fast forward a week: I was hooked.

# Here’s What Makes IPTV a Game-Changer

If you’re not familiar with IPTV, here’s the short version: it’s TV that streams over the internet instead of through cable or satellite. This means no bulky equipment, no installations, and no contracts.

With IPTV, you’re not just replacing cable—you’re upgrading to a streaming service that gives you WAY more for WAY less.

Here’s what I got for just $15/month:

* **50,000+ live channels** (yes, you read that right).
* All the premium networks—sports, movies, entertainment, you name it.
* **120,000+ on-demand movies and shows** in 4K.
* Pay-per-view events like UFC fights and boxing matches included.
* Channels from all over the world—news, sports, and entertainment in dozens of languages.

All I had to do was sign up, install the app on my Smart TV, and start streaming. No cables. No technicians. No hassle.

# Why Are People Switching to IPTV?

It’s simple: cable is expensive, restrictive, and outdated. IPTV is affordable, flexible, and built for the way we consume entertainment today.

Here’s why I made the switch—and why you probably should too.

# 1. It’s Shockingly Affordable

I used to pay $120/month for cable, and every year, my bill seemed to creep higher. With IPTV, I’m paying **$15/month**—that’s less than what I’d spend on two cups of coffee at Starbucks.

And unlike cable, there are no surprise fees or charges. What you see is what you pay.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Many IPTV providers also offer lifetime deals. I upgraded to a lifetime plan for just $200, and now I never have to worry about monthly bills again. That’s less than what I was spending in two months of cable!

# 2. You Can Watch EVERYTHING You Want

The sheer amount of content you get with IPTV is insane. With cable, I was stuck with a few hundred channels. With IPTV, I now have **50,000+ channels** and **120,000 on-demand titles** at my fingertips.

* Sports fans: Every major league, every game, live and in HD.
* Movie buffs: From Hollywood blockbusters to indie gems, it’s all there.
* Families: Tons of kids’ programming and family-friendly content.
* International viewers: Channels from the UK, Canada, India, Europe, Asia, and more.

If you can think of it, IPTV probably has it.

# 3. It’s Built for the Way We Watch TV in 2025

Gone are the days of being tied to a cable box in your living room. With IPTV, you can watch TV on **any device, anywhere**.

* Stream on your Smart TV, phone, tablet, or laptop.
* Watch live sports on your phone while you’re out and about.
* Take your entertainment with you when you travel—IPTV works globally.

📱 **On the move?** I’ve watched live NFL games on my phone while sitting in a coffee shop. The flexibility is unreal.

# 4. No Contracts, No Commitment

One of the worst parts of cable is being locked into a contract. With IPTV, there’s no fine print.

* **Cancel anytime**: If you’re not happy, you’re not stuck.
* **No credit checks**: Anyone can sign up, hassle-free.
* **No equipment rentals**: All you need is an internet connection and a device.

It’s entertainment on your terms.

# 5. You’ll Never Miss a Game or Event Again

If you’re a sports fan, **this alone makes IPTV worth it**. Every game, every league, every major event—it’s all included in your subscription.

* NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and soccer leagues like the Premier League and La Liga.
* Pay-per-view events like UFC, WWE, and boxing matches.
* International sports and regional exclusives.

And the best part? No blackouts, no restrictions, and no extra fees.

🎯 **Gamblers’ Bonus:** IPTV streams are fast and reliable, so you can place live bets while watching the action unfold in real-time.

# Why This Deal Won’t Last Forever

IPTV is blowing up in popularity, and it’s easy to see why. But with demand skyrocketing, prices are likely to increase in the near future.

The $15/month plans available now? They won’t be around forever. That’s why so many savvy Redditors are locking in lifetime deals while they still can.

💸 **Don’t Wait Until It’s Too Late**: If you’re tired of overpriced cable bills and endless subscription costs, now’s the time to make the switch.

# The Best IPTV Providers in 2025

Not all IPTV providers are created equal. After doing my research (and reading way too many Reddit threads), here are the top providers that consistently get rave reviews:

1. [**IPTV GREAT**](http://iptvgreat.xyz/) – Affordable, reliable, and packed with content. Plans start at $14.99/month.
2. [**IPTV RESALE**](http://iptvresale.com/) – Tons of premium channels and on-demand options for $20/month.
3. [**IPTV GANG**](http://iptvgang.me/) – A favorite for sports fans and pay-per-view enthusiasts.
4. [**IPTV FOLLOW**](http://iptvfollow.com/) – Budget-friendly plans with a focus on family content.

# Ready to Make the Switch?

If you’ve read this far, you’re probably curious about IPTV—and you should be. It’s affordable, flexible, and packed with more content than you’ll know what to do with.

# 💥 50,000+ channels. 120,000 on-demand titles. 4K streaming. $15/month.

This isn’t just a deal—it’s a steal. So why wait? Say goodbye to overpriced cable and hello to smarter, better entertainment.

1i5ns10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allahabad/comments/1i5ns10/solo_tip_update_maha_kumbh_1719_jan/,Solo Tip Update: Maha Kumbh (17-19 Jan),"Hi, I'm reporting back from my solo trip to the Kumbh. Posting it here in case it helps anyone plan theirs. So here's how the trip panned out:

Day 1:

I reached Prayagraj by train in the morning. The train was delayed so I went straight to the hotel to drop my stuff, and packed what I needed for the day in a bag that I was to carry around with me. Essentials such as money, an extra pair of briefs/shorts for the dip and a light towel for drying up. **Make sure you take comfortable shoes because you will be walking, ALOT!** I was averaging 23 km per day while there. 

I didn't choose an ideal location for my hotel so I was unfortunately close to the station, but I would recommend you look at places closer to the Sangam area, these could be within the tent city, or around Jhusi, arail ghat. 

Went to Indian Coffee House for brunch and I would recommend them for their coffee and South Indian Food. Thereafter grab any e-rick and ask them to take you to Sangam/Chungi. I wanted to start my temple hopping so walked over first to Alopi Devi Temple, before entering the Kumbh Mela area. After a little bit of looking around, I made my way to the Sangam Boating Point where I took a solo boat to take me to the bathing area. You can choose to take a dip by the banks, but I would recommend you go to the middle where the rivers meet for your dip. The solo boat cost me \~500. 

Post dip, I went to Bade Hanuman Temple and Akshayavat, which are close to where the boats dock. Please note that the temple closes in the Afternoon (2:30) and reopens around 4:00 before closing at 6:30. Plan accordingly. 

All this while, you will be on the more commercial side of the Kumbh, and after the temple visit, you can use the Pontoon bridge to walk over to the other side, where all the Akhadas are located. I would recommend that you read up on the different akharas that are there so that you can pick and choose the ones that you would want to visit. Please note that the mela is too large for anyone to visit all the places even if they had a week to spare. So choose accordingly. 

I had posted my travel plans here on Reddit and was lucky to have fellow Redditors join me as I went around the different Akahadas. Also, there is so much food going around that you can hop over to any akhada offering their prasad and eat to your heart's content. 

We walked around close to 2:00 AM before calling it a day, and I took my cab back to the hotel.

  
Day 2: I was recommended a few food joints around the city so went first to Loknath Chowk, where you will find Hari Ram and Sons ( a 135-year-old shop famous for their masala samosa) and other eateries offering good chaat and tikki. Mind you, all these shops are quite old and have very unique flavour profiles to the food they serve, I would recommend a visit here. Thereafter, I went to see the Chandrashekhar Azad Memorial and Victoria Memorial, both located in the same compound. This is optional. 

I then went to the University area, since my father studied there, just to walk around the old hostel buildings. Then went over to Netram (another food joint) for brunch. Post brunch, I was off again to the mela but this time took a cab to Jhusi asking him to stop for a few atop Shastri Bridge. From the bridge, you can get a view of the entire Mela area, which is equal parts awe-inspiring (given the large gathering) as well as a little intimidating (imagining the number of people within the small area of the temporary tent city). Since we went over the bridge, day 2 starts from the Jhusi side of the mela, where all the akhadas are located. I was there till 12:30 before calling it a day. Had an early morning train back to Delhi. 

  
A few Pointers aside from above: 

1. Take a really good pair of shoes

2. Don't carry too much luggage when you'll be visiting the mela, because you'll be walking a lot.

3. Having company is nice because you will be seeing interesting things that you might want to share/talk about without the need for too much context.

4. Ideally get a location close to the Mela area.

5. Tatkal is your friend while booking train tickets.

6. Don't engage everyone that walks up to you, because they usually want you to give them money. 

7. Be respectful to the Sadhus, and refrain from taking pictures without asking, or pointing. Just basic civil manners.

Hey y'all, hoping I can get some clarification or recommendations here, cause a little bit worried right now if I might have something persistent.

For information, 27M, ex smoker, no known medical diagnoses, and not taking any medication currently.

To kinda give the blow by blow on what happened, at Christmas last month I was tending to the fire, before starting to get hit with waves of nausea and lightheadedness; I would feel woozy and feel my heart rate start to rise as I would become increasingly nauseous, getting hotter and hotter as well, before I would eventually throw up. After I threw up, I would feel fine, my heart rate would slow down and I would cool down. Now, if this happened once or twice, it might be fine, but I experienced this loop multiple times over a twelve hour period; not a great way to spend Christmas. After six hours I was able to avoid throwing up (and for about four of those hours I'd pretty much been vomiting up just spit - I couldn't even hold down water) by controlling my breathing when I felt my heart rate spiking, taking deep breaths and waiting out the spike in heart rate, before it would eventually go back down to normal (before spiking again in a couple of minutes). Rinse and repeat. I eventually fell asleep and woke up, and, while definitely fragile, seemed to be past it. At the time I operated under the assumption I'd gotten carbon monoxide poisoning, from tending to the fire in a kind of shitty fireplace, but now I'm not sure.

Cause it just happened again, out of the blue; I woke up from being asleep, and noticed the same kind of 'elevated heart rate with nausea' thing; lo and behold, I've had to go to the bathroom every time that my breathing can't ride out the spike to throw up. For the past six hours. It hasn't been fun.

For the record, I didn't take anything either times: around Christmas I had two glasses of wine the night before, maybe, but nothing else, and today, I haven't had a drink or anything like that in more than a week; mainly have just been drinking water, tea, and coffee. Nor am I experiencing any anxiety or anything; yesterday and today are my days off. And never had anything happen like this before, far as I'm aware. The intensity of the symptoms does seem a bit less this time around, but it still feels like everything I experienced back at Christmas.

Does anyone know what might be going on? Is this just something I have to deal with now, or should it go away on its own? And what are some ways I can deal with/mitigate these waves beyond the breathing? Cause....this is a pain.

Thank you!",1,1737370762.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We had an early start on yesterday's trip home from Big City, but then things just started to happen. 

First we got a call from “Patrick,” who had worked so hard to prepare his experience, that he wasn't feeling well and didn't want to go out in the cold. “No worries, Patrick, take good care of yourself and we will fill you in on what happened.”

Veera had two guests confirmed but she called us to say they canceled. “No worries, Veera, let's meet up with them for coffee this week.”

Hazel, our beautiful YWD–who was scheduled to be our MC–called to say that she could not get her car started and was waiting for AAA to come. Most likely she will not be there. “Don't worry, Hazel, let's catch up for coffee this week!”

Then we got home and hugged the kids. They were so happy to see ~~us~~ Benjamin Kdaké. My parents and the kids wanted to share about their big weekend together. So Dee and Eulogio set off to the discussion meeting at Laverne & Shirley's, Guy went to our meeting at Emily's, and I put up the kettle for tea with my parents.

Here's Guy's report:

>We had 12 there, one short of our target. Guy, Emily, Veera, Jack, John, Chima, the Three Sisters, Charlie, Mikey, and our MD Chapter leader (our central figure). Instead of Patrick's experience, we decided to just do a go-around check-in. 

>The Three Sisters started and the meeting did not get beyond that. *(Julie: They are all very private people and I am including this with their approval.)* 

>They talked about the Paramount+ series *1923* and the character Teonna Rainwater, a young woman who was forced to attend one of the assimilation schools that existed at that time. There were no such schools where we live but they talked about their deep pain growing up and how they saw themselves in the way Teonna persisted and resisted 

>They needed to say what they said and we needed to listen. That was our entire meeting--and a huge step in developing our community!

>I didn't get the chance to do the study presentation on the Four Bodhisattvas and our chapter leader closed the meeting by wishing everyone a happy New Year and thanking the Three Sisters for opening up their hearts so widely. He gave out flyers for Saturday's Chapter Kickoff Meeting. He and I both agreed to send out emails this week with what we were going to say.

My parents decided to spend another night with us so we all watched the Bills-Ravens game in the warming hut. (Thanks, Bernie and Artie, for organizing it so nicely!) Yes, the Bills squeaked through but it was not pretty. We won more because of the other team's sloppy play. With our game, I don't see how we can prevail over the Kansas City Chiefs next weekend, especially since the game will be at their stadium. Well, a win is still a win.

The four of us plus Benjamin Kdaké spent the night on blow-up mattresses we set up in the Lance RV “Spa.” We talked about “a new vision” for our relationship as we start our fourth year together.

Anyways, this morning Benjamin Kdaké and I listened to [A Battle to Believe in Our Lives](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/a-battle-to-believe-in-our-lives/) in the January 17th World Tribune. *“With the SGI-USA’s focus on friendship, community and raising successors, the World Tribune sat down with Renee Benson, the Louisiana-Mississippi Region women’s leader, to hear about their united effort as a Soka community to support youth.”* It's quite an amazing and inspirational story that really speaks directly to people like us living in [“flyover country”](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/160314-flyover-country-origin-language-midwest).

I (23F) have had a gym crush for a while now. We often make eye contact, and I feel like he seeks it out or looks at me in general quite a lot. However, the last time I smiled at him, he didn’t smile back, which made me feel a bit unsure.

It’s very rare for me to find someone so attractive right from the start, which is why I’m considering just talking to him.

I don’t want to go straight into giving him my number or inviting him for coffee/dinner. I was thinking of starting with something casual, like asking about an exercise or something trivial, and then seeing how things go. If it goes well, I could still ask him at the end if he could show me the exercise sometime or if he’d want to train together.

As a man, would you interpret something like this as an attempt to flirt, or would you see it as purely platonic?

On one hand, you often hear that men are totally oblivious to women flirting unless you make it very obvious. On the other hand, you also hear that men interpret any contact initiated by a woman as flirting because they see it from their own perspective, and they’d only approach a woman if they were interested.

I’d like to make it as unawkward as possible since we’re probably going to keep running into each other.

Honestly, I just want to use a first conversation to get a feel for his personality and see if I even have a chance with him. But I don’t know how I’d be able to tell during the conversation whether he’s interested or just being polite.

Unfortunately, he always trains alone, and as far as I know, I don’t know anyone who knows him. So I can’t figure out the basics (like whether he’s single or how old he is) in advance.

I’d appreciate any kind of advice 😊",8,1737370322.0,dating_advice,9,0.9,False

The first was during my Friday after work run in the hills and stopped off for a coffee using the outer fly as a tarp like setup. Packs small and fits in my Inov8 8L running vest, with a flask and jacket.

The second was for a wild camp on the Shropshire Hills. 

Very easy to pitch and attach the inner when out in the wild. The two identical vestibules is great:
1. for being able to sit at either door for sunset/sunrise. 
2. as I have a dog, I can use one of the doors to enter and exit so he isn't having to walk over my sleep system.
3. I can put my pack in the vestibule I'm not using to cook which saves space in the tent.

One downside I've noticed is the grey guy lines are hard to see when light drops! However, they do reflect the head torch light well, so it's only an issue when it's not quite head torch time.

Also made my first mod during the night spent in it, just a small one. Ran some light weight cord between the two small loops to create a hanging line for wet kit and also cokes in handy to hang my light which can be moved to distribute the light more centrally.

1i5nchx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpinnCoffee/comments/1i5nchx/how_good_is_the_spinns_espresso/,How good *is* the Spinn's espresso?,"Currently I'm using a Nespresso original line machine as a stopgap until the Spinn 2 is delivered. (After trying a lot of pods, I've found the L'OR ones to be far and away the best. I use two pods per cappuccino.) I previously used a Gaggia semi-automatic that produced good-to-excellent espresso depending on the day.  
  
I've never had the opportunity to try the Spinn's espresso, so I'm hoping to get a better idea of how it stacks up against the coffee produced by other machines. My assumption has long been that it is as good as that of any other fully automatic espresso machine, but probably less good (albeit more consistent) than that of a semi-automatic. I also assume that it's significantly better than a Nespresso original line machine's output.

Would you say that's accurate? Feel free to set me straight.

1i5nbvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i5nbvo/how_do_you_talk_to_people_at_a_cafe_without/,How do you talk to people at a cafe without becoming a nuisance?,"I'm a 29 year-male with virtually no social life outside of work. Some of my coworkers seem decently friendly, and one even went so far as to blurt out that he loved me (like a brother), which felt really nice to a lonely, affection-starved man like myself. However, I can't shake the feeling that most of them secretly see me as strange and slow-on-the-uptake, since I have mild cerebral palsy and am on the spectrum, so I don't feel particularly close to any of them. Another one of my coworkers joked that she didn't believe what people said about me, and while I never pressed the old lady for more details, I know what she was implying about me. I've noticed one strikingly beautiful cashier at my workplace, but have largely avoided her because she's far out of my league and almost certainly not interested in a pudgy, homely, and slow-witted nerd with a speech impediment and the personality of a brick.

So, I'm trying to make friends and find love  outside of my workplace. Since I'm a staunch teetotaler who thinks it's absurdly creepy to lurk in bars, not order any drinks, and just strike up conversations with potentially inebriated and vulnerable women, I've taken to hanging out a coffee shop, ordering stuff, and just passively waiting for someone to chat with me if they feel so inclined. I know I have to man up and talk to people, but I don't want to gain a reputation as the creepy guy who goes around pestering random strangers. How do you talk to people at coffee-shops without being creepy or obnoxious?",5,1737369138.0,dating_advice,3,0.86,False
1i5nboo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design_WATC/comments/1i5nboo/why_retro_design_is_our_modern_muse/,Why Retro Design is Our Modern Muse,"**Why Retro Design is Our Modern Muse**

Hey, have you noticed something lately? It seems like everywhere you look, there's a splash of the past. From fashion to logos, from websites to the corners of your favorite coffee shop, [retro and vintage design](https://weandthecolor.com/how-retro-vintage-shaping-modern-design/194968) elements are having a major moment. It's like the design world hit the rewind button, right?

But it's not just a random throwback party. There's a deeper current flowing beneath the surface. So, why is everyone suddenly obsessed with the styles of yesteryear? What's making us crave that vintage vibe? It's more than just a trend; it's a fascinating conversation between the present and the past. Let's unpack it together.

**The Comfort of Familiarity**

Think about it: in our hyper-connected, ever-evolving digital world, there's a lot of change coming at us all the time. Constant updates, endless feeds, and new technologies popping up daily. It can be a bit overwhelming, right? Vintage design, on the other hand, offers a sense of stability and comfort. It feels familiar, like a warm hug from an old friend. It’s the visual equivalent of comfort food.

We all have memories associated with certain aesthetics. Maybe it’s the groovy patterns of your childhood bedroom, the bold typography of your favorite old movie posters, or the playful colors of vintage toys. When designers tap into those elements, they're triggering a powerful emotional response. It's like the design speaks to our soul, whispering ""Remember this? It felt good, didn't it?"".

**Standing Out From the Crowd**

Beyond the comfort factor, there's also a desire to be different. How many perfectly sleek, ultra-modern brands have you seen lately? They all start to blend together, don’t they? That's where retro design shines. It’s inherently unique.

By using vintage fonts, hand-drawn illustrations, or textures that feel worn and lived-in, brands can instantly stand out. They are adding personality and character to a world that can often feel a bit sterile. It’s like choosing a cool, thrifted outfit over something brand new from the mall. It has a story, it has a soul, and it's certainly not like everyone else's.

**A New Kind of Storytelling**

What’s really interesting, though, is that designers aren’t just copying the past. They’re drawing inspiration from it. They are blending retro elements with modern techniques and aesthetics, creating a new kind of design language. It's like taking the classic chords of an old song and adding a brand-new melody.

You see it in websites that use retro-inspired color palettes but are still fully responsive and functional. You find it in logos that use vintage fonts but are designed to work perfectly across digital platforms. It’s about respecting the past, but also understanding the needs and context of the present. It’s not just about “old,” it’s about “timeless” given a modern spin.

**More Than Just Aesthetics**

Is this just a fleeting trend, destined to fade away? Maybe in its exact current form, but the spirit of it, I think, is here to stay. The desire for authenticity, for connection, for something that feels real, that's a fundamental human need. And retro design, in its various forms, speaks directly to that need.

So, next time you see that vintage font or that retro pattern, ask yourself not just what it looks like, but what it makes you feel. It's more than just a visual style. It's a connection to the past, a way of finding comfort in the present, and a way of creating something truly unique for the future. What stories will we be telling through design next? It’s all part of the ongoing conversation. I’m excited to see. And you?

1i5n8qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1i5n8qi/i_still_live_with_my_abusive_ex_girlfriend_she/,I still live with my abusive ex girlfriend. She doesn't live in reality and refuses to take accountability ,"Preface: this is going to be a long one, do bear with me. This is a short account of what happened, there's much more that happened but it'd be a novel 

So, my ex (F21) and I (M23) met at a pretty shit time in our lives and I was responsible for trying to keep her alive for months. She starved herself to get the attention of mental health professionals and I had to basically attempt to feed her and there were ambulances called every other day. She manipulated me into living with her and her parents, lied about her dad and made things incredibly awkward. 

They pretty much just had me doing housework, he couldn't be arsed to even bother speaking to me and constantly disrespected me. I had just gotten out of a mental health crisis and had quite bad skill regression so even housework was a bit difficult. 

She verbally abused me for eating too slowly, for messing things up, she tore apart my self image and then when her dad tried to break us up she then attempted to manipulate me into still living with them. We moved in together and I was subletting despite it being a terrible arrangement, obviously I had to put that in was living at my mum's for student finance and my payments got cut short by around 4k for living. She continued to verbally abuse, scream and shout that her flatmates almost had to get involved, she used to bully me for my appearance and discomfort at taking photos and used to call me names when I couldn't ""look right"" or pull the right expression for a photo , she'd then kick up a fuss and throw a tantrum when I obviously started hating taking photos. She poured coffee (not hot) on my uni notes and chucked it everywhere whenever she used to go on these rants and when I refused to respond. She refused to take accountability for any of this until August this year (after we were together for nearly 2 years). She'd talk about other dudes, call me too skinny and then act all supportive when I bulked up as though she didn't give me crippling body dysmorphia as a result, not one ounce of accountability for that either. She used to throw things, lock herself in her room for seemingly no reason. Whenever she didn't get a reaction she'd keep going on and on. She'd also just condescend me on politics and my whole uni degree as if sociology was the hardest damn subject in the world (which I never even said it was easy but why?)

We finally moved into a flat share, and she continued belittling me albeit less, she was them so overly performative in her ""getting better"" act. 

We broke up in October but she told me she was gonna go on a date and that I should take her back if I didn't want that, the same day I found her in my bed (we were out when I broke up w/ her) and it took me 30 mins to get her out of my room. She continued disrespecting boundaries even when I suggested a break.

So this brings us to now. As soon as I broke up with her, she did a complete 180. She's back to being rude, and refuses to take accountability for anything. It's like she's actually delusional, and it kinda drives me insane. She's taken it upon herself to bring a different dude back every day and it's just pathetic tbh, I'm not jealous, I'm angry because this is her way of trying to get back at me. All I wanted was for her to step up and be an adult, acknowledge what she's done but she's gone and told everyone a bunch of shit that just isn't true. And I don't know what to do, she's in a few activist groups and I'm tempted to write a document and release it, but I don't know if that'll make things worse tbh.

She said that I leeched money off her parents. For what? When I lived with her parents they paid for food for all of us, and they helped a little for food when I was subletting. I was incredibly confused at this accusation. So I was leeching money for... Food that we both shared? I don't get why anyone would do that considering it would have been easier for me to literally live in a separate accomodation.

The point is. I'm fucking hurt, I'm hurt that every single thing about her becoming a better person was a fucking lie, and that it didn't continue after the breakup. If I abused a girl and she left me, I think I'd have been like ""fair enough, I was a cunt"" but the moment we break up it was back to her old self. I hate seeing her stupid face, and all I wanted was some fucking acknowledgement. But I can't even argue that with her because she's delusional, she'll swear up and down and justify it and I guess I'm having a hard time that some people can't be reasoned with. She caused me some deep fucking pain and wants to go on and tell everyone that she's the victim, I have recordings and screenshots of this but I don't even know what the point would be of releasing it.",1,1737368750.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Since the bloom stage is to make the grind pump out the gas and extract flavour better for later stage, and the coffee comes from blooming is impurity. So I wondering why people dont just discard the blooming stage output？",0,1737368545.0,pourover,10,0.42,False

I make 4 long blacks a day, so that’s the priority.
I already have a GBW Allground Sense grinder, so I’m all set on that front.
Hot water through the machine is non-negotiable – I want to avoid the kettle shuffle.
Counter space is… let’s say “Sydney apartment cosy.”
Budget isn’t a dealbreaker, but I also don’t want to buy a machine that feels like overkill for my needs.
Ideally, I’d like a PID (precision, baby!), but I don’t need a dual boiler.

I’ve done a bit of research (read: hours of YouTube rabbit holes) and was initially keen on the Profitec Go, but no hot water tap? Tragic. Then I looked at the Rancilio Silvia, but no factory-fitted PID? Close, but no cigar. The Rancilio Silvia Pro looks solid, but I wonder if it’s a bit too much machine for just making long blacks?

Any advice or recommendations would be hugely appreciated – especially from those who also focus on long blacks but dabble in the milk world when guests are over. And thanks to this community for being a goldmine of coffee knowledge and general caffeinated banter.",1,1737368517.0,espresso,4,1.0,False
